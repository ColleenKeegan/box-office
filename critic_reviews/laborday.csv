It works wonders for Kate Winslet in Labor Day. She plays depressed single-mum Adele who takes in an escaped prisoner Frank (Josh Brolin) over the Labor Day holiday weekend. He turns out to be a dream houseguest making himself useful around the house fixing creaky doors cleaning out the guttering and versing her 13-year-old son Henry (Gattlin Griffith) in the ways of manhood. And he bakes a pie - a sticky sensual scene that rises into an emotional peak like the peaches piled in the cake tin. It could do more for sales of flour than the Great British Bake Off. If you have even the tiniest cynical bone in your body avoid. Youll find Labor Day more sugary than a cronut. Based on a 2009 novel by Joyce Maynard its a shift in gear for director Jason Reitman whose back-catalogue is filled with sarky-sweet comedies like Juno. What keeps this out of Nicholas Sparks bumper-paperback territory are terrific performances and Reitmans control of the drama. The early scenes are nailbiting. This needs to happen Frank menaces wrapping his big hand around little Henrys neck as he forces himself into their home. For 20 minutes you dont know if hes going to murder Adele and Henry in their beds or scramble them some eggs. If any other actress was playing Adele it would be the performance of a life. But this is Kate Winslet who can pull off Oscar-grade without breaking sweat. Possibly Labor Day is not strong enough to send another Oscar nomination her way but she is Revolutionary Road-brilliant - once again somehow making an epic the story of an ordinary woman. And Josh Brolin furrow his brows with manly determination.

Given that she rarely makes a bad film I figured it was worth a watch. It really was.Even though the story is a little far fetched and some of the scenes more than cheesy it works and the three main actors make it sizzle.

By Dana Stevens Gattlin Griffith Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet in Labor Day. Photo courtesy Dale Robinette/Paramount Pictures Corporation/Franks Pie Company When youre harboring an escaped murderer in your home because he accosted you in a grocery store and implicitly threatened your child its so nice when he can help out with the chores. Such seems to be the moral of Jason Reitmans befuddling Labor Day a sluggish romantic drama (based on a novel of the same title by Joyce Maynard) about a prison escapee who shacks up over the holiday in question with a depressed single mother and her lonely pubescent son. The foundational assumption on which this movie is built--that choosing to shelter that handsome muscled fugitive from justice might just be the best idea the passive shut-in Adele (Kate Winslet) ever had--has a teenage-daydream absurdity that almost elevates Labor Day to the realm of camp (an honor it misses out on only by being too boring). Reitmans previous four films--Thank You for Smoking Juno Up in the Air and Young Adult--featured flawed but dynamic protagonists who struggled to overcome their mistakes and bad choices. Adele makes hay of hers From the moment she agrees to take in the injured hunky Frank (Josh Brolin)--who insists without elaborating that hes never hurt anyone intentionally in his life--things start looking up for her and 13-year-old Henry (Gattlin Griffith) whos been forced to act as a kind of surrogate husband to his unhappy mother since his dad (Clark Gregg) left them to start a new family with his secretary. Its only a matter of time we soon realize until Frank and Adele will be kneading something other than dough. One of Franks first acts upon arriving at their ramshackle house is to tie Henry and his mother up--gently and in Adeles case rather sensually--in order to make it look like theyre his hostages not his hosts should the fuzz burst in. But once it becomes clear that for the moment no one is hot on his trail Frank loosens the bonds of rope and begins to strengthen the bonds ... of love. Over a span of mere days--the long weekends progress is marked off in on-screen titles reading ""Friday"" ""Saturday"" etc.--Frank makes himself indispensable fixing the broken sink tuning up the cars engine and--that ultimate signifier of paternal manliness--teaching the unathletic Henry how to properly throw a baseball. Most gratifying of all--both for the love-starved Henry and Adele and for the entertainment-starved audience--Frank can cook like an ex-con angel. His first night there he whips up an impromptu batch of chili feeding it to the tied-up Adele after tenderly blowing on each bite. Later he makes breakfast biscuits that are consumed in reverent silence and then after a neighbor (J.K. Simmons) brings over a basket of perfectly ripe peaches teaches Henry and his mother how to bake a perfect peach pie. The gauzily erotic pie-making montage with close-ups of hands submerged to the wrist in bowls of slippery fruit as an acoustic guitar noodles on the soundtrack is the movies camp high point a culinary equivalent of the iconic pottery-wheel scene in Ghost. Its only a matter of time we soon realize until Frank and Adele will be kneading something other than dough. Slowly (very slowly) and inexorably the manhunt for Frank closes in on this pop-up happy family. Henry cant resist dropping hints about his glamorous house guest to the cute but manipulative new girl in town (Brighid Fleming) who fans his Oedipal jealousy and fears of abandonment by suggesting that his mother may be looking to leave town with her new man and leave him behind. Franks memories of the long-ago crime that led to his incarceration begin to return in the form of ever-less-fragmented flashbacks. And a friendly local cop (James Van Der Beek) starts to notice something amiss in the goings-on at Adele and Henrys place Why do they appear to be packing up their house to move just as the boy is due back at school for the fall? The grown-up Henry--heard in a voiceover by Tobey Maguire who also appears briefly in the films coda--will explain it all for you but not until long after youve predicted the Nicholas Sparks-worthy denouement. One thing I will say for Labor Day It contains some valuable cooking tips from the suggestion of adding brewed coffee to ground-beef chili to the scattering of tapioca beads over the bottom of a pie crust to ward off sogginess (""like salt on an icy road"" counsels Frank as they prepare the pastry that will change their lives forever). Maybe that explains Labor Days sticky-sweet sentimentality and mushy narrative structure Jason Reitman forgot the tapioca. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

"Labor Day | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; labor-day ) Labor Day (United States 2014) January 31 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli ""Labor"" isnt just a word in the title of Jason Reitmans new film its a description of what it feels like to sit through the movie. Messy poorly focused and overflowing with artifice Labor Day is an unpleasant surprise to come from the pen of the man who helmed Up in the Air and Juno. The wit of Reitmans previous outings is entirely absent and its not clear what he wants Labor Day to be although the result ends up skewing disappointingly close to something out of the imagination of Nicholas Sparks. The movie contains elements of a thriller a coming-of-age tale and an overcooked love story but although it frequently tries to re-invent itself Labor Day never successfully latches onto anything. The film which is set in a 1987 that seems more like 1977 begins with promise. The opening scenes establish an unsettling atmosphere enhanced by Rolfe Kents discordant score. For a while Labor Day seems headed into psychological thriller territory as we wonder about the motives of the mysterious stranger played by Josh Brolin. Sadly it soon becomes apparent that Brolins Frank is precisely what he appears to be an escaped convict with a heart of gold. Hes not hiding any secrets. Maybe that represents a ""twist"" of sorts but its also a letdown. Once we figure out that theres nothing ominous about Frank we can feel comfortable about his getting close to Adele (Kate Winslet). Theyre both lonely lost souls who find comfort in each others arms. As I said Nicholas Sparks territory. Adele lives alone with her 13-year old son Henry (Gattlin Griffith). Shes afflicted with depression and agoraphobia. On a rare day when she leaves her home to go shopping she and Henry encounter Frank who is bleeding and in obvious need of help. Adele initially refuses but changes her mind when Frank makes a thinly veiled threat to Henrys life. The three return to Adele and Henrys house where they learn that Frank is an escaped prisoner and the object of a huge manhunt. As he hides out from the police he and Adele bond while Henry ponders what this means for his future. As ex-cons go Frank is a gem. Hes a master chef - I suppose the peach pie baking scene is intended to mimic the clay molding in Ghost - and a whiz at fixing broken things. He changes the oil in the car stops the door from squeaking teaches Henry the basics of baseball and generally makes himself useful. He also recovers pretty quickly from the injuries sustained in his flight from the police. Hes pretty much the perfect guy - kind considerate and never inclined toward violence. We keep expecting the faASSade to crack but it never does. The films point-of-view is confused. Although events are presented through Henrys eyes (with Tobey Maguire providing the voiceover narration) the movie inexplicably throws in flashbacks detailing Franks sad past and occasionally incorporates scenes where Henry isnt present. Much of Labor Day is just slow and plodding but there are a couple of subplots that stand out as particularly awful. One involves a ""wild"" girl who catches Henrys eye and the other features an overly helpful cop. Coming-of-age tales can be fertile ground but Reitman fails to do much with Henrys character. Were provided with images that indicate hes starting to have sexual thoughts. There are some Oedipal moments although these are glossed over quickly enough to retain the PG-13 rating. Part of the problem is that actor Gattlin Griffith isnt suited for the role; his performance is wooden and unconvincing. Despite supposedly providing the films emotional core Henry often blends into the background. Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin are fine but both stay within their comfort zones. Its always disheartening to sit through a mediocre movie but when that production comes from someone with a proven track record its doubly disappointing. Reitman has made some fine movies; this is easily his worst. Labor Day is awkward and unsure and while one could cite the source material Joyce Maynards novel Reitmans treatment fails every litmus test of a satisfying adaptation. Initial marketing campaigns positioned Labor Day as a possible Oscar contender but following tepid early screenings Paramount quietly moved the film into the January graveyard which is an appropriate place for it to rest in peace.

Happened.When those are the words passing through ones head as one exits the cinema it typically means that the film just viewed was either exceptionally good or exceptionally bad. In the case of Jason Reitmans latest movie the lugubrious Labor Day Im afraid its the latter.To date Reitmans work had been distinguished by an acerbic pop-inflected sense of irony his promising debut Thank You for Smoking; his out-of-nowhere charmer Juno; his Clooneyfied mainstream affirmation Up in the Air; and his interesting but ultimately half-baked Young Adult. All four had their moments of sentiment but none were what one would call overly sentimental. Indeed Id assumed that if Reitman were ever to deliver a genuine stinker it would be by erring on the side of sarcasm.Related Story Love Actually Is Actually the Least Romantic Film of All Time But deliver a genuine stinker he has and its failings lie in precisely the opposite direction. Labor Day (based on the novel by Joyce Maynard) is the heart-string-tugging tale of a teenage boy his lonesome mother and the escaped fugitive who as they say ""changes their lives forever."" It is the most cloying maudlin movie Ive seen in a long while so saccharine that its very memory makes my teeth ache to the root. The audience at the screening I attended seemed largely to agree It is surely a bad sign when a films would-be weepiest moments primarily elicit tears of laughter.That said there is a place in the world for cloying maudlin melodrama (its called ""Lifetime"") and if you find yourself in the mood for something akin to The Bridges of Madison County only more so then feel free to make your way to the nearest showing of Labor Day. But by all means stop reading this column now. For in the interest of explaining what an astonishing pile of overwrought mush the movie is I intend to offer a great many spoilers. Youve been warned.The year is 1987 and divorced damaged mom Adele (Kate Winslet) lives alone with her 13-year-old son Henry (Gattlin Griffith). ""I dont think losing my father broke my mothers heart but rather losing love itself"" Henry explains in Hallmarkian voiceover. (More on this later.) But one day when mother and son make their monthly pilgrimage to Price-Mart--post-divorce Adele has become so twitchily neurotic that she is virtually incapable of leaving the house--a handsome goateed stranger (Josh Brolin) asks them with just the slightest hint of menace for a lift. He has escaped from prison it turns out where he was serving an 18-year sentence for murder. He has Adele take him to her house where he very gently ties her to a chair explaining that this way she will be able to truthfully tell authorities that she is a kidnappee rather than a criminal abettor.And that is the very last even marginally unpleasant thing the escaped felon Frank does for the remainder of the film. That night he cooks Adele and Henry chili; in the morning its homemade biscuits. (Barbeque will have to wait a day or two.) Over the course of the long Labor Day weekend for which the film is named Frank fixes a basement wall a loose stair and a squeaky door; conducts auto repairs and an oil change; replaces electrical fuses and the filter on the furnace; does the laundry (and irons it); washes the floor (and waxes it); and using Amish techniques single-handedly raises a barn in the backyard. Okay I made up that last one.It is the most cloying maudlin movie Ive seen in a long while so saccharine that its very memory makes my teeth ache to the root. Between his bouts of This-Old-House fervor Frank teaches shy awkward Henry how to hit a baseball and sweetly connects with a disabled wheelchair-bound neighborhood boy whose mother is cruel and negligent.   And then theres The Pie. When the man who lives across the street (J.K. Simmons onscreen for approximately 12 seconds) drops off a bucket of peaches at the house Adele frets that there are too many to eat and shell likely wind up throwing them away. Not so declares Frank who evidently shared a cell with Martha Stewart They will make pie. It would be difficult to overstate just how much screen time is devoted to the pie-making and how aggressively the process is fetishized. One shot in which Frank Adele and Henry knead a bowl of peach-mush together fingers pulpily entangled would have earned the movie an NC-17 rating if the MPAA were doing its job. Throughout Frank maintains a steady patter of culinary homilies ""people pay too much attention to recipes when all you have to do is feel"" ""all these fancy gadgets but sometimes the best tool is right there attached to your body.""Speaking of which Yes Frank and Adele do get it on. And while they do--I promise Im not making this up--Henry sits in the bedroom next door contemplating the word ""rhythm.""By Franks third day at the house he and Adele have concluded they are in love and have concocted a plan to run away to Canada with Henry. Yeah thatll work.The story unfolds with an earnestness so implacable that on the rare occasions when a bit of humor sneaks into the proceedings it feels like an uninvited party guest. One such example is Henrys chance meeting of a nosy precocious girl (Maika Monroe) whom he winds up telling more than he intended.Its around this point that we at last learn via the culmination of a series of flashbacks how it is that the otherwise beatification-worthy Frank wound up in prison for murder. It seems that when he was a handsome young man he had a pretty young wife and an adorable baby. But his pretty young wife was cheating on him and the baby was probably not his. When he confronted her about these transgressions she sneered at him and he pushed her. She of course fell down hit her head on a radiator and died. I have two thoughts regarding this development one narrow and one broader. I would like to propose a 50-year moratorium on people dying in the movies merely because someone pushes them. The narrow thought is that an even minimally sophisticated film probably would have concluded that it was enough either for the wife to be so awful that its hard to mourn her death or for said death to be completely accidental. But Labor Day pulls out every stop in order to render Frank blame-free He didnt try to kill his wife--but even if he had could you blame him?The slightly broader thought is that I would like to propose a 50-year moratorium on people dying in the movies merely because someone pushes them. No more falling down staircases or against marble fireplaces or over open dishwasher doors or what have you. In the real world the act of pushing very rarely results in death or permanent disability. But in cinema its a convenient way to simultaneously engineer a dramatic event and dispel responsibility for it. I have been unable to do the math for obvious reasons but I have a nagging suspicion that more people may have died of pushing in movies than in all of actual human history. Enough already.But back to Labor Day. After a few implausibly constructed cliffhangers--the neighbor who walks into the house without knocking the bank manager who grills Adele on why shes emptying her account the policeman who insists on driving Henry home and then insists on helping Adele pack boxes into the station wagon--Frank is finally (big spoiler) captured by the police. Which is extremely sad because there is no way in the world that Adele can afford to hire herself a new chef/housekeeper/repairman/gigolo/baseball coach--especially not one who cleans up as nice as Josh Brolin.Which brings us to our denouement Frank goes back to prison with an additional 15 years added to his sentence for kidnapping. When Adele tries to tell the prosecutor that no kidnapping took place he quite rightly points out that either she was kidnapped or she harbored a fugitive and itd be a shame for Henry if his mom went to jail. So Adele goes back to her life of lonely suffering Henry goes to live with his dad (an underused Clark Gregg) for a while and then comes back at age 17 played by a new actor who bears very little resemblance to the one weve grown accustomed to. (Its an age difference of four years It really ought to be manageable with the same performer.) This new ""Henry"" takes his first stab at baking--a pie for his mother naturally.The pie-making scene would have earned the movie an NC-17 rating if the MPAA were doing its job.Fast-forward 20 years and we meet the now-adult Henry played by Tobey Maguire. To which I can only say Why in the world would you cast the eternally adolescent Maguire in a role whose only purpose is to convey adulthood? Making matters still worse hes the one whos conducted Henrys voiceover throughout the film--though viewers could be forgiven for not noticing given that his voice is virtually indistinguishable from of that the 15-year-old who plays Henry for the bulk of the film. Richard Dreyfuss in Stand By Me this is not.Which brings me to the movies final excruciating twist Frank whos about to be released from prison contacts Henry to see if Adele is still available. (She is and the two reunite to live happily ever after.) How did Frank track Henry down? Well the latter has become a successful pastry chef() and Frank saw a glossy magazine article with a photo of a peach pie and recognized it as the same pie hed taught Henry to make all those years before and well you get the picture.What possessed Reitman to make this dull cliche-ridden treacle-delivery device? I wouldnt dare to hazard a guess. But if someone were to tell me that Reitman had been kidnapped by an escaped convict and held hostage until he helped him tell his side of the story I wouldnt discount the possibility.

""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight or sleep Last month my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests--the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed.

Based on Joyce Maynards 2009 novel and set in leafy small-town New England in 1987 its about Frank Chambers (Josh Brolin) an escaped convict who takes refuge with Adele Wheeler (Kate Winslet) a single mother and her teenage son Henry (Gattlin Griffith).Frank is no ordinary felon. First of all hes (kind of) innocent. Hes also tough-tender and caring and a real gentleman. Most of all hes a great cook. We see him whip up a first-class chili but his specialty is peach pie which we watch him prepare so lovingly that I was surprised Reitman didnt include the recipe in the end credits.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 31 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 31 2014 105PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jason Reitman Written by Jason Reitman Starring Kate Winslet Josh Brolin and Gattlin Griffith Classification PG Country USA Language English ""The world will pardon my mush"" goes the Gershwin brothers 1928 song Ive Got a Crush on You and since the tune has been sung and recorded every decade since then presumably the world did. How the world will feel about Jason Reitmans mushy Labor Day is another question. Certainly its a departure for the director who made his name on such acerbic comedies as Thank You For Smoking Juno Up in the Air and Young Adult. Labor Day which Reitman adapted from a 2009 novel by novelist Joyce Maynard (To Die For) falls more into The Bridges of Madison County or The Notebook area. Handout Movie Review Video Weekend movie review Labor Day Worth a watch if youre into abduction love stories The mush here is literal and peachy. In a pivotal scene escaped prisoner Frank (Josh Brolin) takes the hand of Adele (Kate Winslet) the woman he is holding hostage and shoves it into a pan of mashed peaches. Sometimes says Frank meaningfully the best tools are the ones attached to our own bodies.Adeles 13-year-old son Henry (Gattlin Griffith) who narrates the film looks on in astonishment. His mothers hands started trembling he tells us and could not stop. This is followed by a time-lapse image of a pie in the oven swelling to a golden rippling tumescence. The year is 1987 and Henry is telling us this story from his adult perspective (voiced by Tobey Maguire). No surprise Henry grew up to become a baker.Much of Labor Day eventually becomes soft-core erotica; initially its filled with autumnal restraint as the opening scenes find us drifting in slow-motion through a leafy New Hampshire suburb while Henry tells about his big Labour Day weekend. Henrys mother has been deeply sad ever since her divorce. It wasnt about losing her husband (Clark Gregg) who left her for his secretary but ""rather losing love itself.""Adele is hunched over with downcast eyes. Shes also agoraphobic leaving Henry to do her chores and banking except for a monthly trip in the station wagon to the local PriceSmart discount store. Its on one of these back-to-school shopping outings when Frank sporting a seeping bloodstain on his undershirt from a recent appendectomy in a prison hospital approaches Henry. He then leads Henry to his mother and with his hand around the back of the boys neck scares them into taking him for a ride. Hes polite but forceful ""Frankly this needs to happen"" says Frank frankly.As they drive back to the house through the leafy suburbs the music growls and thrums with menace.Then less than half an hour into the film the menace disappears and the movie goes soft and gooey. Frank cleans the floor does the laundry fixes the loose floorboard changes the furnace filter and teaches Henry how to throw a curveball. Hes the perfect husband the perfect dad but this is also of course a sexual abduction fantasy. On the flimsy excuse that Adele needs to prove shes not willingly helping a fugitive Frank also ties Adele up. Then he spoon-feeds her the chili he has made as if she were a baby. (I suspect there must be websites where you can watch people tied up and spoon-fed; its creepy). Of course that causes Adele to fall in love but given her tremulous yearning gazes you get the impression the same thing might have happened if she had brushed hands with the mail man.Later in the film Adele tells Frank - in a gruelling series of flashbacks - the long ordeal of miscarriages and other misfortunes that drove her into a depression.""I came to save you Adele"" declares Frank.Well not precisely. As you recall he was escaping from prison and she looked especially vulnerable in the PriceSmart that day. As the television news reports keep telling us Frank is a convicted murderer and eventually in overlit flashback sequences we see what drove him to crime as a young military vet with a run-around wife but as he says ""I never intentionally hurt anyone"" which stretches the meaning of the word ""intention."" Oddly Frank is out and about cleaning eavestroughs and rotating tires in the driveway of the single moms home while the whole town is obsessed with the dangerous stranger in their midst. Such lapses in logic are constant in the film - the trains dont run on Labour Day weekend but the library is open? - which presumably is a way of saying love makes its own rules.Henry stirred by all the passion in the house on that fateful long weekend has time out of the house to develop a quick adolescent crush of his own and finds a confidant in a sassy sarcastic new girl in town (Brighid Fleming) who warns him that sex drives adults insane and the new man in his mothers life will cause her to abandon him. Henry has his moment of doubt but he knows better Passionate people like his mom and Frank are superior people.Theyre definitely better than Henrys dad or his new wife with her oversized glasses and cliche-filled speech or his inarticulate jock half-brother. Theyre far better than the the horrible neighbour mother (Brooke Smith) who dumps her physically and mentally disabled son at Adeles house and slaps the boy when he tries to tell her whats going on.Perhaps this is the reason why I cant pardon Labor Days mush not just because its mush but because it comes with an unappetizing side order of condescension and contempt.

Its so terrible its amazing. The film is based on a Joyce Maynard novel a wet Oedipal fantasy with a dash of kink that turns family-friendly with a vengeance. The narrator is the grown-up Henry (Gattlin Griffith) a pubescent lad whose father has decamped and whose mother Adele (Kate Winslet) has become a virtual shut-in -- shattered says Henry not by the loss of her husband but the loss of ""love itself."" He tries to replace her ex but it wont take. Hes not of age. And then as if out of his fervid imagination in steps an escaped prisoner Frank (Josh Brolin) a hunk with ropy muscles who takes refuge in their home to nurse his injuries and wait for a passing train. ""If someone came by"" he tells Adele ""I would have to tie you up"" and so he does winding rope in close-up around her wrists and fleshy calves. He pulls a pack of ground meat out of the freezer browns it chops an onion adds a couple of cans of tomato sauce and finishes it up with a generous splash of coffee. Then he feeds it to his hostage first blowing gently on the spoon. Before you know it he has whipped up some biscuits too. Adele tastes one closes her eyes chews slowly opens her eyes and gazes on him as if she has found God. Soon Frank is fixing the sink and the car and teaching Henry to catch a baseball all the while sweating manfully in the late summer heat. My wife turned to me and said ""I want one."" Reitman has announced that the book moved him to tears and he has labored (the title is apt) to make an American classic a coming-of-age movie shivering with eroticism streaked with flashbacks shot in an impressionistic catch-as-catch-can style like a Nicholas Sparks novel directed by Terrence Malick. I didnt enjoy laughing at Winslet though who overacts with all her heart her eyes signaling fright while her lips and bosom quiver with longing. Frank says he ought to be leaving but its no no its Labor Day weekend no hurry wait till Tuesday ... When a neighbor brings a bushel of peaches at their fragile peak he knows just what to do. To the tender strains of a classical guitar the three muddle the peaches in a big bowl with sugar and then he schools them in the art of mixing pie-crust dough by hand. ""A little tapioca"" he says sprinkling the little beads ""like salt on an icy road."" A prominent E.T. poster suggests that Reitman is aiming to make the teen-hormonal sequel to Spielbergs prepubescent fantasy of a fatherless boy longing for a sign from On High. But Labor Day is clunky schematic and drawn out. The snake in the garden is a girl Henrys age who stirs his loins and plays on his insecurities when he tells her theres a man in the house ""He wants you out so they can have sex ... Get rid of him or hell get rid of you."" Would Henry blow the whistle on his rival? Will the movie end in a hail of bullets like Bonnie and Clyde? I wont tell but the coda features a line that will echo through the annals of accidental camp ""One day I came across a familiar-looking pie ..."" Its Reitman whos pie-eyed and drippy.

Labor Day (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Labor Day (PG-13) An escaped con moves in with his heart of gold. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com1/30/2014 Editor rating 2 As escaped convicts go Frank (Josh Brolin) is a pretty great guy. Sure he may take you hostage threaten you and your child and strongarm his way into your house (without a weapon and well get to that later). But hell also change the oil in the car repair the squeaky door and the wobbly step and teach your shy son how to change a tire throw a baseball and make a mean peach pie lessons that will carry him manfully through his adult life. Also and this is not incidental Frank is brooding and sexy especially in a blood-spattered tight white T shirt. Which bodes well for Mom. If you can get past the ludicrous fantasy -- well wait thats the problem. You cant get past the ludicrous fantasy. Based on the novel by Joyce Maynard Labor Day is romantic blarney on a grand scale -- even though it tries to be a tight tense profound movie about sexual awakening and responsibility. But the tension comes and goes and is sometimes teased out awkwardly; the profundity is forced; and the script is so far-fetched that even Kate Winslet cant do much with it. Adapted and directed by Jason Reitman who usually chooses much better material (Up in the Air Juno Young Adult) the film focuses on a Very Special Labor Day weekend in 1987 for young Henry (Gattlin Griffith) and his depressed divorced mother Adele (Winslet). The adult Henry (Tobey Maguire) narrates the story of how his father (Clark Gregg) left and remarried and how his mother has never really been the same since. Then one day while Henry is out shopping for new school clothes a sweaty man walks up to him in the store and asks for a ride. Henry who is heading into seventh grade but unaware of stranger danger dutifully brings the man to Adele. Turns out the stranger named Frank (Brolin) wants a ride and wants it now. The power of his menacing stare is too intense to resist. Confronted Adele wilts though one scream would end the whole thing right then and there and so Frank gets his ride to Adeles house. Frank says hell leave as soon as darkness falls only he doesnt and Adele who has been without a man too long finds herself drawn to him. Over the course of the weekend they grow close and Henry begins to feel longings himself -- and then starts to wonder if their murmured plans include him. Labor Day is the sort of movie where the characters are all extremely watchful They shoot worried glances at each other but dont demonstrate much good sense. If you chose to harbor a fugitive murderer wouldnt you lock the front door so that your nosy neighbors couldnt just barge in? Would you maybe dance in the dark instead of in front of the screen door illuminated by the soft glow of lights? Would you order your son to visit the smalltown library on a Sunday to investigate escape routes when a library almost certainly wouldnt be open? Reitman does get a few things right He teases out Franks backstory in an evocative way and the family pie-making scene is rich and sensual. Brolin and Winslet work up an acceptable amount of heat. But Labor Day never becomes more than an unlikely and belabored melodrama; its not the sweeping fervent statement about love that its makers intended.

A strong hushed handsome man.Hes handy around the house. He knows how to dance.He can cook chili and make breakfast.He teaches Adeles 13-year-old boy Henry (Gattlin Griffith) how to play baseball.And he has an awesome recipe for peach pie.The fact that Frank Chambers (Josh Brolin) is also an escaped convict imprisoned for killing someone may complicate matters a bit. But hey you take what you can get.Labor Day is a strange strangely compelling romance - one minute its Harlequin bodice-ripper the next its Jim Thompson pulp. In fact its an adaptation of Joyce Maynards novel set in 1980s New England with screenplay and direction by Jason Reitman who heads off into unexpected terrain after the coolly observed character studies of Young Adult (Charlize Theron as a bitter boozing author) and Up in the Air (George Clooney as a slick efficiency expert).Adele agoraphobic and dependent on her son is like Reitmans earlier protagonists pretty much alone in the world. When her husband left her for another woman the love drained from Adeles soul leaving her (literally) shaking and scared. Henry does his best to tend to his mothers needs assuming responsibilities that typically dont fall on a fledgling teen. But their life is frozen muted melancholy.And then a guy with a limp and a gash in his gut corners Henry in a department store and convinces the Wheelers to take him back to their place.What begins as a hostage situation soon becomes something else altogether a swooning love story. Brolins portrayal of the runaway inmate Frank is wonderfully sly - hes a walking talking lovemaking fantasy of sensitive hunkhood. The actor knows this guy is too much but he makes him genuine nonetheless.And Winslet is just extraordinary as this fragile flinching woman who returns to her senses - and whose senses return to her - in the company of this mysterious stranger.Griffith who was Angelina Jolies missing son in Clint Eastwoods Changeling is likewise remarkable. Labor Day is a coming-of-age story too and Henrys transformation is key to the story even if its clumsily framed in a looking-back voiceover (supplied by Tobey Maguire as the adult Henry).There are other missteps. The flashbacks to Franks pre-prison days and to an earlier love story are gauzy and sun-splattered in the manner of Terrence Malick. And a coda with old-age makeup is not to be believed. There are other better places to end this yarn.And it is a yarn. But its so full of passion poetry and humor that it becomes for the time quite real.Now where can we get a slice of that pie?

Remember when a groups debut album would come out? (Remember when there were albums?) And theyd be your new favorite band. Except the second album would feel kind of rushed and the third would sound like a sell out. And youd realize the group only had one good album in them. Because that first one was the one theyd been working for all their lives. Its the same with directors. As nearly impossible as it is to make that first good film the second and third are even harder. Because then you have to prove that its not a fluke and you still have something to say -- and even better ways to say it. Jason Reitman is a great little band. He started out with ""Thank You for Smoking"" a hard-edged little comedy -- but then followed that with the sweetly loopy ""Juno."" ""Up in the Air"" a truly terrific film was sober and mature while ""Young Adult"" albeit flawed dared to present a noxious character who didnt change and never would. Each film tried new things and showed new style. ""Labor Day"" is another risk. Although it has a few smiles its far less mocking than Reitmans other films. It uses music in different ways too -- building tension with some purely rhythmic patches -- and incorporates several dreamy wordless flashbacks. It may be more of a step sideways than a step forward -- and a bit contrived -- but it has its charms. Reitman has always gotten great performances from his players and ""Labor Day"" continues that trend. It stars Kate Winslet as an abandoned fortyish woman living with her son in a tumbledown New England house and so agoraphobic she only leaves it for monthly shopping trips. Then on one of those trips shes confronted by an escaped convict. Hes Josh Brolin and his threatening if never violent insistence makes her take him home. But while hes hiding out there over a long holiday weekend something happens. He starts to open up. She starts to calm down. They start to become a couple. The story based on a novel by Joyce Maynard is a bit far-fetched to be sure. Some of the characters actions strain credulity and I know there will be complaints from critics particularly from men who never seem able to sit through a romance without smirking. (Although for some reason they have no trouble suspending logic for action movies.) Yet implausible as things occasionally get in ""Labor Day"" the actors make it believable. Winslets always been eager to shed the silliness of youth -- just watch ""Revolutionary Road"" again -- but here the 38-year-old captures the slightly frowsy distraction of a woman so locked up in old tragedies shes forgotten the world around her. N.J. NEWS ON THE GO Our redesigned mobile site has quick page loads and app-style navigation and lets you join the conversation with comments and social media. Visit NJ.com from any mobile browser. Less heralded perhaps -- or simply taken for granted -- is Brolin. But if youve forgotten that theres more to this man onscreen than his simple commanding cowboy presence he reminds you again in a quiet forceful performance full of old-fashioned charisma and quiet command. Oh and while the romance here is mostly quiet theres a kitchen scene that may do for peach pies what ""Ghost"" did for pottery wheels. Although the movie isnt as soft-centered as the audience at an early Toronto screening seemed to think (I heard more than a few muttered comparisons to ""The Bridges of Madison County"") neither is it a searing drama; although it was once briefly thought of as a possible 2013 awards contender clearly those dreams didnt come true. But while ""Labor Day"" isnt the stuff of blockbusters or Oscar juggernauts it is a simple adult romance made for grownups by grownups about love and second chances. And proof again that real talent shows itself not in what you do first but what you do next. Ratings note The film contains some violence and sensuality. Labor Day (PG-13) Paramount (111min.) Directed by Jason Reitman. With Kate Winslet Josh Brolin.

Grade C- You half expect Josh Brolin to croon ""Handy Man"" James Taylor-style as his escaped-convict hero takes shelter in the home of a depressed agoraphobic single mother (Kate Winslet) and her doting barely pubescent son (Gattlin Griffith). Just like in the song hes handy with love and hes no fool - he can fix broken hearts without using a pencil or a rule. Hes a natural born househusband who can tune a car clean a gutter or whip together dynamite chili without looking at a manual or a recipe book. And hes just aching for a boy to replace the child he lost when ... well when a movie is this limp you cant give away a big ""reveal."" Set during a sweltering Labor Day weekend in 1987 New Hampshire ""Labor Day"" aims for a forked kind of suspense. The question of whether the escaped con will be caught is meant to rouse opposite emotions at the beginning and end. But the film fails to generate much tension either way. Despite the actors best efforts visually and dramatically its stuck in amber. The problem is writer-director Jason Reitmans misplaced reverence for Joyce Maynards 2009 novel. His literal adaptation exposes all the books melodramatic manipulations. Winslets character sinks into despondency after she endures several failed pregnancies and her husband leaves her for his secretary. Enter Brolin another victim of a failed marriage. Hes kept in prime mental and physical shape during 18 years in stir. The divorcee loves dancing and hes got natural rhythm whether hes teaching the boy how to throw a baseball or wrangling mother and son into helping him make a peach pie. That bout of baking makes an immediate sensuous impact on Winslet and has far-reaching consequences for the boy. Everything fits together like crust and filling.

He can cheerfully fix a flat clean the roof gutters oil a squeaky door caulk a stone wall. He cooks with such sexual authority that if he had a Food Network show it would be called The Sensuous Chef. This estimable gent is also a convicted murderer just escaped from prison and he wants you to harbor him for the weekend in the secluded home you share with your young son. Whats a lonely woman to say? Hell yeah Watching Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet in Labor Day some viewers familiar with director Jason Reitmans work may wonder Is he serious? In his early features Reitman carved an important niche for himself maker of smart comedies with a sweet or acrid tinge. The social satire Thank You for Smoking was followed by Juno in which a pregnant teen taught her parents and other adults the meaning of maturity; one of all-time biggest indie-film hits it earned the director an Oscar nomination and writer Diablo Cody an Academy statuette. Reitmans third film Up in the Air got as close to masterpiece status as any story about a frequent flier (George Clooney) in need of emotional grounding could. It might have taken Best Picture in 2010 if it hadnt been overlooked in the Oscar custody battle between ex-spouses James Cameron (Avatar) and Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker); Bigelow won. Young Adult from a Cody script about a prom queen (Charlize Theron) who thinks shes still irresistible 20 years later danced boozily between slapstick and pathos. Reitman seemed to be testing the audience to find the comic-anguished tone his movie couldnt quite achieve. (READ Corlisss review of Jason Reitmans Up in the Air) In Labor Day which had eyes for Oscar but received no nominations Reitman strides into a new genre pulp fiction ladies style. For this adaptation of Joyce Maynards 2009 novel is a home-invasion drama transformed into a romantic bondage fantasy. Or as the author and the director want you to think of it a love story. Its the equivalent of those tabloid tales of lonely women who visit prisons to talk fervently with and sometimes marry death-row inmates -- except that here the killer comes to the woman. The old (younger) Jason Reitman might have made merry or at least wry with this premise. But the Labor Day Reitman is dead serious in his approach to a species of fiction that is fervid turbid and borderline-implausible. As in You will meet a tall dark stranger. He will tie you up and feed you the chili he has cooked blowing on it before slipping the fork into your mouth. If your response to that gesture is a concupiscent ""Aaahhh"" and not a repulsed ""Ewwww"" you will know youve met that special someone in this your very special movie. (Here I must confess to a genetic inferiority Im a guy. When I described the finger-licking chili scene and made a frowny face to Mary Corliss who had not seen the movie she smiled seraphically and said ""Aaahhh"") (READ Kate Winslet says having three children by three different men helped her play the mother in Labor Day) Divorcee Adele (Winslet) suffers from a depression that keeps her virtually housebound. Fortunately her 13-year-old son Hank (Gattlin Griffith) is the most loving caretaker and to the best of his innocent ability surrogate spouse. He creates gift coupons that proclaim him Husband for a Day and devises a Date Night excursion to see the movie D.A.R.Y.L.; the year is 1985 the place rural New Hampshire. Unfortunately -- or do we mean fabulously?-- the one time that Adele and Hank go to a superstore they meet the escaped convict Frank (Brolin) his clothes bloodstained his manner urgent and desperate. He intimidates Adele and Hank into taking him to their home to hide him until the police lose his trail. Since this is Thursday and the movie is called Labor Day you can figure that Frank will have a long weekend to get to know his captors. ""I wont let anything happen to my son"" Kate warns Frank who softly replies ""Hes in good hands."" These hands are now binding Adele to a kitchen chair so she can watch him make chili. Later as her resentment cools and her ardor heats up the three make crust for a peach pie their hands kneading the dough in a visual menage a tourte. As the weekend lengthens and neighbors drop by Adele and Hank grow protective of their guest. Stockholm Syndrome never kicked in so quickly. (READ Mark Harris cover story on Kate Winslet by subscribing to TIME) And why not? This killer is divine. He teaches the slightly awkward Hank the fine points of baseball -- ""When Frank threw me the ball"" Tobey Maguires voiceover narration swoonily recalls as the adult Hank ""I hit it."" An artist in the bedroom as well as the kitchen Frank has kidnapped Adele from her dreary life abducted her to a level of passion she always desired but never before attained. He is her brute jailor and sweet savior -- her sado-Messiah. Maynard whose works include the novel To Die For (made into the 1995 movie) and a memoir of her teenage tryst with J.D. Salinger has written that part of Labor Day was inspired by ""a kind of fantasy love affair I found myself in when I was myself a young and very lonely single mother living in a small New Hampshire town with my three young children and I got a letter (first one then a hundred more) from a man in prison who seemed to know and understand me better than anyone else. (I eventually learned -- when it appeared he was getting out of prison and coming to visit my children and me -- that this man was a double murderer.)"" (READ Elizabeth Gleick on Joyce Maynards book about her affair with J.D. Salinger) She called the man ""Mr. Wrong."" But the fictional Frank as embodied by Brolin with a sympathetic machismo is clearly Adeles Mr. Right and Hanks too the ideal father for a boy whose own dad has remarried and the heaven-sent lover for a sensuous woman. Frank seems the hunkiest saint ever to land on Adeles Earth; in one scene backlighting gives Brolin an actual halo. Does Frank even exist? Or is he Adeles and Hanks dual dream of how the hole in their lives might be filled? And if so will that dream turn to nightmare by Act Three and Adele realize that she should not rely on the kindness of sexy strangers? (That would throw the cold water of hostage melodrama into the warm bath of  lubricious reverie. But SPOILER ALERT  . . . . . Hell no.) In his earlier films Reitman often brought a sharp twist to his observation of complex personalities. Labor Day has one wonderful laugh line when Adele first lets Frank into her home and says ""Youll have to excuse the mess"" -- the housewifes reflexive apology that she wouldve cleaned up the place if she had known shed be entertaining a killer kidnapper. But other lines seem either inadvertently funny or paying obeisance to the demands of bodice-ripping fiction as when handyman Frank says ""Sometimes the best tool is attached to your own body."" Suddenly Labor Day is not a movie but a Harlequin book cover and Frank is a felonious Fabio. (READ Andrea Sachs on the global boom in bodice-rippers) The director hasnt forfeited his acuity of place and pace or his gift for steering good actors to performances that suit the spirit of the piece. Winslet six times Oscar-nominated (and a winner for The Reader) remains the movies sultriest most sullen madonna. She imparts full weight to Adele allowing Franks appeal to creep slowly over her like a strange male hand on a female thigh during an overnight crosscountry flight. Brolin in the most attractive turn of his career brings as much subtlety as possible to the strangely sanctified Frank. Griffith who in Green Lantern played the young Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is fine in another idealized role the perfect son. Its best to concentrate on these excellent performers and their characters in the ecstatic middle section of Labor Day rather than toward the end when a grand conspiracy of plot contrivances kicks in to delay or thwart their destiny. Leave this holy family -- mother son and holy ghost -- in the holiday of their dream world. You might also pray that Jason Reitman recovers his sense of humor which means a worldly sense of perspective with his next movie. And hold the chili.

Opening in January in the Dallas area. By JOY TIPPING Follow joytipping jtippingdallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 30 January 2014 0455 PM Updated 31 January 2014 0543 PM Related Author Joyce Maynard reflects on Jason Reitmans film adaptation of her book Labor Day Vanessa Hudgens keeps growing up in Gimme Shelter Chris Vognars thoughts on the Oscar nominations (and snubs) including the local favorite Theres a beautifully filmed if unutterably boring sequence involving pastry in Labor Day directed and written by Jason Reitman (based on Joyce Maynards novel) that every single preview story has lingered on much as Reitman tarries on the minutiae of the film.The peach-pie scene as it will inevitably become known has been endlessly compared to the pottery-wheel episode in Ghost which featured a clay-spattered Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze doing everything but actually having sex as she makes a bowl or vase or something (does anyone actually remember what it was?).The ""everything but having sex"" part is whats really terribly offensive about the scenes comparison because Labor Days peach-pie scene involves not only two on-the-verge-of-consenting adults but a pubescent child. Intimate? Yes. Loving and communal? Absolutely. Sexual? Lets not go there.And that alas sums up the main problem overall with the movie It doesnt go here there or much of anywhere. In compressing Maynards deeply internal book into the necessarily visual film format Reitman strips the story of nearly all of the books barely repressed sexual heat and hence most of its impact.The story is told through the eyes of teenage Henry Wheeler (dreamboat-in-the-making Gattlin Griffith) whos living with his lonely nearly agoraphobic single mother Adele (Kate Winslet making depression look gorgeous even in the frumpiest of all possible dresses).On a rare outing into town for back-to-school clothes Henry and Adele encounter the bleeding Frank (a stoic ever-so-manly Josh Brolin). Without so much as a frantic glance at the cashier Adele allows Frank to persuade her to take him back to her house. Frank is an escaped convict but of course as he tells Henry ""theres more to the story"" than the TV is reporting.Henrys voice so strong in the novel is all but lost in the film which is given over instead to detail. After detail. After detail. Viewers will be able to make that blasted peach pie; we are shown every single step. Were made aware of the Wheelers downtrodden status via the sputtering car the chipped house paint the pantry of sad-looking canned goods.Over the course of the titular weekend Frank cooks yummy fresh meals fixes the car paints and generally performs every little touch-up job a lonely gal might want.Henry cant help but be charmed by Frank but his heart and head get turned by his friend Evelyn (Brooke Smith) whos about Henrys chronological age but far older in notions about men especially those who might convince a mother to leave her son behind.If you want a delicious recipe for peach pie or go all dreamy-eyed at pretty cinematography and over-sentimentality by all means this is the film for you.If youre looking for a story-forest rather than just a bunch of pretty-tree details youre better off reading Maynards book.LABOR DAY (C)Directed by Jason Reitman.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 625 p.m. EST January 31 2014This soap opera-style fantasy of a passionately brooding killer and his sad lady love is the kind of overheated nonsense expected in a Harlequin romance not the work of a usually perceptive director.Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet star in ""Labor Day.""__(Photo Dale Robinette Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of fourStars Kate Winslet Josh Brolin Gattlin Griffith Tobey Maguire Clark Gregg J.K. SimmonsRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 51 minutes; opens Friday nationwideLabor Day feels like a belabored sappy slog.On top of the films unending sense of torpor the characters and story are completely implausible (1/2 stars out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).Based on a novel by Joyce Maynard and adapted and directed by Jason Reitman(Up in the Air) this romance between a lonely mother and the fugitive who takes her and her son captive is almost laughably bad. Think textbook Stockholm Syndrome as seen through the eyes of sentimental novelist Nicholas Sparks.Even the presence of top-notch actors cant save this melodrama. Kate Winslet does her best to make her character convincing but the absurd material leaves her floundering. She plays Adele Wheeler the depressed mother of 13-year-old Henry (Gattlin Griffith). Though Adele is meant to be mired in melancholy after her divorce from Gerald (Clark Gregg) mostly she seems tranquilized and meek.Even worse is the intermittent narration by Tobey Maguire as the adult Henry musing on this pivotal summer. Its rarely illuminating and occasionally creepy in its Oedipal undertones. The film is in part about sexual stirring -- Adeles rekindled and Henrys burgeoning sense of it.STORY Food stylist is secret ingredient in Labor DayMORE Food stylist dishes on her Hollywood subjectsRECIPE How to make that peach pie from Labor DayREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersEscaped convict Frank Chambers (Josh Brolin) confronts Adele and Henry at a department store and demands a ride. Then this blood-stained stranger insists on hiding out in her house on the outskirts of a small town where everyone knows everyone elses business.Every local newscast is breathlessly reporting the disappearance of Chambers who turns out to be an escaped killer.Back at Adeles house Frank tries to explain that the story is not what it seems. He implies hes actually a gentle soul. But flashbacks leading to Franks arrest dont provide the intended exoneration or emotional impact.Killer Frank ties Adele up ever so gently and seductively. Its more like foreplay than anything menacing. Within hours he morphs into a father -- and husband -- figure. He goes from ominous to lovable by making a pie playing catch with Henry and mopping the brow of a disabled neighbor boy.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare In Labor Day Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet play a fugitive and a broken-hearted single mom ""two people who couldnt go out into the world. So they made a world with eachother."" VPCAdele falls fast and hard. On top of it all Frank is handy around the house fixing her car and cleaning leaves out of a rain gutter. What a catch except for that little matter of his prison sentence.Adeles sad reclusive existence is suddenly brightened. She teaches Frank to dance the rumba and in no time shes ready to make an impulsive major move.Still its one thing for Adele to be swept away by the hunky Frank whom Brolin plays with a bland sense of mystery. But Henrys affection for him is baffling. The boy has a dad who lives nearby but he seems as starved for male attention as his mom. Apparently any male will do -- even an escaped convict. Just because Frank spouts folk wisdom like ""a pie crust is a very forgiving thing"" doesnt negate the fact that he killed someone.The films treacly ending is even harder to swallow than the 90 minutes that came before.Hardest to believe is that this inane saga is the work of Reitman who wrote and directed 2005s ultra-smart comedy Thank You for Smoking and 2009s clever Up in the Air. Clearly this was not an ideal match of material and filmmaker.Then again a ridiculous saga of a killer with a heart of gold who charms a shut-in and teaches her son to be a man is probably not a good fit for any filmmaker. 35 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1bDLS2Q",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/01/30/labor-day-review/3584709/,200,laborday16,laborday,usatoday

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Henry (Gattlin Griffith) left Frank (Josh Brolin) and Adele (Kate Winslet) grow close after an intense introduction in ""Labor Day."" (Dale Robinette) By Ann Hornaday January 30 2014 Follow AnnHornaday ""Labor Day"" turns out to be aptly titled and not only because it transpires over the course of one hot-and-heavy summers end in the mid-1980s. In this intense exquisitely photographed domestic potboiler both Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin deliver studiously serious performances trying mightily not to betray how hard theyre working to overcome the preposterous story in which they find themselves. Adapted by Jason Reitman from a novel by Joyce Maynard this sexually charged wish- fulfillment fantasy -- complete with troubling masochistic and Oedipal undertones -- arrives with people already buzzing about its standout scene in which Brolins charismatic ex-convict teaches Winslets depressive agoraphobic housewife how to bake a peach pie (never before has the word ""crumbing"" been quite so erotically charged). But that turns out to be just one of the many gemutlich talents of Frank who first meets Adele (Winslet) and her 13-year-old son Henry (Gattlin Griffith) when they take a rare outing to buy school clothes. Having recently escaped from prison Frank forces himself into their car and proceeds to hold them hostage in their airless unkempt house. Soon the taciturn rough-hewn dreamboat is changing the oil in Adeles car teaching Henry how to throw a baseball waxing the floors and even ironing. Its not for nothing that back in the variety store he emerged from behind a rack of superhero comics. If only Reitman best known for such comedies as ""Juno"" ""Up in the Air"" and ""Young Adult"" had brought some wit or swiftness to bear on Maynards painfully trite and retrograde plot which grows only more contrived with the introduction of a creepily precocious girl whom Henry fatefully befriends at the local library. But ""Labor Day"" has been staged so handsomely its actors delivering such alternately seductive and solemn performances that the blame seems most fairly assigned to the source material which resorts to facile captivity fantasies and cheap psychology rather than the characters own contradictions to make its dramatic points. Its difficult to believe a word of ""Labor Day"" but then again you dont have to in order to luxuriate in Winslet and Brolins bubbling steaming chemistry. Still between this ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""Mildred Pierce"" it seems past time for Winslet to cast off the sackcloth and ashes of suburban angst and live it up a little. A girl cant live on pie and penance alone.   PG-13. At area theaters. Contains thematic material brief violence and sexuality. 111 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Inventor Tim Jenison seeks to understand the painting techniques used by Dutch Master Johannes Vermeer. (Photo/Video Sony Pictures Classics) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated Jan. 30 2014 710 p.m. ET ""Tims Vermeer"" a fascinating documentary by the comic magicians Penn amp; Teller has a way of arousing passionate feelings while provoking fresh ideas about the porous border between technology and art. The film was produced by Penn Jillette and directed by Teller in his feature debut. Its serious in purpose an inquiry into how the 17th-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer was able to achieve his mysteriously dense almost photorealistic detail--seemingly suffused with an inner glow--long before the invention of photography. But the scholarship is enlivened sometimes hilariously by showmanship. At certain points the inquiry takes on the trappings of an elaborate magic trick performed by the movies guru and genial star a computer-graphics virtuoso video-software inventor and multimillionaire tinkerer named Tim Jenison. With nothing up his sleeves (""Im not a painter"" he keeps telling us) Mr. Jenison demonstrates how the 17th-century Dutch master might have gone about creating his singular scenes (with mirrors as befits a magician of any century plus lenses that were widely available in the Holland of that time). He does so by using elegantly simple technology that Vermeer might have used--the key word is might--to paint his own version of ""The Music Lesson"" a beloved masterpiece by one of the most revered figures in the pantheon of Western culture. No connoisseur would mistake Mr. Jenisons Vermeer for the real thing but his handiwork makes a strong case for the ingenious speculations that informed his amateur effort. This isnt the first time someone has suggested that Vermeer employed optical tools along with his brushes pigments and canvas. More than a decade ago the contemporary painter and photographer David Hockney among others proposed that many of the Old Masters including Vermeer used a camera obscura--essentially a big pinhole camera--fitted with a lens to focus images of their subjects on canvas then traced the outlines before filling in the details. But Mr. Jenison carries the proposition much further. His method involves a 45-degree-angle mirror not much larger than the kind used by dentists on a movable stand. Positioned between projected image and canvas the comparator mirror as he calls it allows him to duplicate colors as well as outlines and details in one small area after another. This is bound to sound abstruse in the telling but its perfectly clear in the showing and only the beginning of a process that qualifies Mr. Jenison as a New Master of obsessive-compulsive devotion. Thats because of the lengths he eventually goes to during eight years of study preparation and execution. He doesnt copy from the original with its daylight-bright room in which a young woman stands at a harpsichord her male teacher alongside her. That would have been impossible in any case since Queen Elizabeth II has ""The Music Lesson"" under protective custody in Buckingham Palace. Instead he spends 213 days building a full-scale replica of that venerable room and its contents in his warehouse in San Antonio. (The process is considerably compressed in a film that runs 80 minutes.) At the same time he learns to mix pigments as the artist would have done and makes his own lenses. Then with the help of his trusty mirror he spends another 130 days reproducing projected images of the replica on canvas area by area detail by painstaking detail. ""Its possible"" Mr. Jenison says that Vermeer ""was more of an experimenter more of a tinkerer and more of a geek and in that way I feel a kinship with him. Because Im a computer-graphics guy and we use technology to make beautiful images."" The experiment is spellbinding though some of the commentary is opaque or at least incomplete. We are told for example that the human retinas limited bandwidth would have made it impossible for Vermeer to capture the gradations of certain areas of his canvas without optical aids. How come? The areas in question dont look unusual and fine artists capture extraordinary nuance as a matter of course. Theres an odd though perhaps inadvertent omission in a key scene when the computer-graphics-guy-turned-painter shows Mr. Hockney his finished faux-Vermeer and the equipment he used to paint it. Mr. Hockney is greatly impressed by the accomplishment ""I think it might disturb quite a lot of people"" he says with wry pleasure. But we never see Mr. Hockney being told about let alone reacting to the crucial role of the angled mirror. And the film could have done without Mr. Jillettes enthusiastic overstatement--showmanship eclipsing scholarship--that ""my friend Tim painted a Vermeer in a warehouse in San Antonio. He painted a Vermeer."" No he didnt. He painted a painting that demonstrated a kind of proprietary hardware Vermeer might have used. Still the enterprise was disturbing enough for friends I took to the screening--a prominent architect and educator and his equally sophisticated wife. They were furious at what they saw as a debunking of the Vermeeer mystique and they insisted at least for a while that the whole thing was bogus or that someone with a more practiced hand than Mr. Jenisons was wielding the brush that with the help of lenses and mirrors produced a Vermeerish minorpiece. But ""Tims Vermeer"" isnt debunkery and the value of the process it documents doesnt depend on the quality of Mr. Jenisons final product even though his painting looks impressive to my limited-bandwidth eyes. His experiment should be seen as an attempted--and impressive--proof of concept while the film proves yet again the vitality of the documentary form. The most intriguing question it raises is whether our feelings about Vermeer may be changed by the likelihood of him having used optics of one sort or another. The answer is yes unavoidably but not necessarily for the worse. Living in this era of explosive growth in science and technology its easy to feel a kinship with an artist who used every tool at his command in the service of beauty. Watch a clip from the film ""Labor Day."" Depressed single mom Adele and her son Henry offer a wounded fearsome man a ride. As police search town for the escaped convict the mother and son gradually learn his true story. (Photo/Video Paramount) Labor Day Its hardly a good sign when a movies best moment turns on a peach pie--not the eating of one but the making of one which in this case makes for a sequence with real buoyancy and style. The setting is small-town New England on a Labor Day weekend in the late 1980s. The pastry impresario Frank (Josh Brolin) is an escaped convict. He has forced himself into the home of a depressed single mother Adele and her 13-year-old son Henry; theyre played by Kate Winslet and Gattlin Griffith. By the time he bakes the pie its clear that this fugitive from the law is not just a good man but ironically under the fraught circumstances the right man for Adele and a fine surrogate father for Henry. ""Labor Day"" adapted from a novel by Joyce Maynard is the kind of movie that turns clarity into stultification; everything is perfectly clear and almost everything--pie-making excepted--is perfectly lifeless. Thats not for lack of trying or talent on the part of the adult co-stars. How much more the teenage actor might have contributed is unknown since the director Jason Reitman seems to have settled for Henrys single expression of wide-eyed longing (or is that pained expectation?). My own expression must have been pained as I watched these inexpressive people in this turgid movie because the director working from his own screenplay is the same Jason Reitman who with his actors found so much fun and spontaneity in ""Juno"" and ""Up in the Air."" This new film might better be called ""Labored Day."" The story moves at a sluggish pace while the emotion ration for each character is one per scene. And just when you think theres no hope for a happy outcome a shameless contrivance looms on a distant horizon. Its a whopper in a weeper. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Girl With a Pearl Earring (2003 ) Exquisitely visualized (with cinematography by Eduardo Serra) deliberately underdramatized and snorefully paced Peter Webbers film version of a bestselling literary fiction stars Scarlett Johansson as Griet a comely young housemaid who in 17th-century Delft becomes the model for one of Vermeers best-loved paintings. Colin Firth plays the painter with suppressed passion but the main fun is watching Tom Wilkinsons quick-eyed wickedness as the patron Pieter van Ruijven. During his lifetime the Dutch master made relatively few paintings but Mr. Serra outdoes him. No matter where he points his camera theres another Vermeer. ENLARGE The Picasso Mystery (1956) Another master painters technique comes to life in Henri-Georges Clouzots documentary a magical indispensable study of Pablo Picasso in the throes of creation. As he sits shirtless and barrel-chested sketching or painting behind a paper screen his inks and colors bleed through and appear in time-lapse or more often real time on our screen. The effect is thrilling. (The cinematographer was Claude Renoir whose grandfather was no slouch as a painter either.) The 20 works Picasso created for this film were destroyed when production ended. The DVD version includes Alain Resnaiss somber black-and-white documentary ""Guernica."" ENLARGE Young Adult (2011) Jason Reitman directed this cockeyed comic triumph from an original screenplay by Diablo Cody. Charlize Theron is Mavis Gary a slatternly wondrously nasty writer of young-adult novels who is delusional in her determination to reconnect with a high-school sweetheart and rescue him from a marriage she imagines to be unhappy. What makes the movie so enjoyable is the same combination that the filmmaker and writer brought to ""Juno""--unerringly subtle yet precise direction plus a literate script with dramatic energy and a delicate tone. The cast includes Patrick Wilson and Patton Oswalt. Corrections amp; Amplifications A caption in a previous version of this article described a scene in which Tim Jenison examined Vermeers original painting of ""The Music Lesson."" The painting was a reproduction. Also an earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the actor Josh Brolin as James Brolin. 130 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Labor Day Share Comment ""Labor Day"" is a star-crossed romance that casts Kate Winslet as a depressive New Hampshire single mother Gattlin Griffith as her protective 12-year-old son and Josh Brolin as the manly escaped prisoner who takes them hostage and falls in love. The movies a very somber affair but if you see it in a disrespectful frame of mind its the guilty-pleasure hoot of the season. You may come out talking about the pie-making scene -- like the pottery sequence in ""Ghost"" except not -- but it probably wont be for the right reasons. Directed inexplicably by Jason Reitman (""Juno"" ""Young Adult"") who doesnt have the knack for straight melodrama.

"Labor Day star may be a killer but he bakes a mean peach pie review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLabor Day star may be a killer but he bakes a mean peach pie reviewYou know a movie is in trouble when you spend most of its running time wondering why on Earth the director wanted to make it. Jason Reitmans overripe melodrama Labor Day is one such movie.Gattlin Griffith left Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet dig deeply into the art of peach-pie making in Labor Day.  (Paramount Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 30 2014Labor DayStarring Kate Winslet Josh Brolin and Gattlin Griffith. Written and directed by Jason Reitman. Opens Jan. 31 at Toronto theatres. 111 minutes. PGYou know a movie is in trouble when you spend most of its running time wondering why on Earth the director wanted to make it.Such is the curious case of Labor Day a glossy melodrama by Jason Reitman who normally treats weepers the way Justin Bieber does career counselling.Article Continued BelowReitman typically goes in for the smart and sassy not the naive and sappy. Labor Days lonely single mom (Kate Winslet) getting her groove back through the Mr. Clean ministrations of an escaped convict (Josh Brolin) is the kind of eye-rolling scenario hed typically mock. And the laughs would be welcomed not the unintended kind that this film frequently summons.You can just imagine say how Junos teen cynics Ellen Page and Olivia Thirlby would react to the squishy scene where Brolins Frank seduces Winslets Adele by the manly way he makes and bakes a peach pie.Is this for real? Like for real for real?Unfortunately yes honest to blog.It brings no pleasure to report this because Reitman is a skilled and savvy filmmaker one who has already demonstrated a facility for drama by way of Up in the Air a multiple Oscar nominee.And Labor Day has him working with two fine actors Winslet and Brolin who normally could draw empathy from a stone. Theyre defeated by Reitmans screenplay his irony-free adaptation of Joyce Maynards 2009 novel. Its as overripe as those peaches that Frank sexily folds into his homemade pie crust.Set in 1987 (but so 1950ish) in a small New Hampshire town the kind of place where everybody knows your name and noses into your affairs the movie clangs like a broken bell almost from the get-go.Adele is struggling to keep her life together and raise her 13-year-old son Henry (Griffith). She was abandoned by her self-centred ex-hubby (Clark Gregg) who split to marry his secretary and start a new family.Almost a recluse timid as a newborn lamb our gal barely manages to make it to the local discount shop to buy a pair of new trousers for Henry who needs them for the impending start of school.Its there between the 2-for-1 racks and the soda pop that prison hospital escapee Frank bleeding from appendix surgery and limping from a leg injury convinces Adele and Henry to let him into their car home and lives in that swift order. In just about the time it would take Mae West to order Beulah to peel her a grape Frank proves himself a handyman of the hearth and heart. He fixes a squeaky door waxes the floor repairs the masonry teaches Henry how to hurl a baseball and exhibits kitchen skills that could shame Martha Stewart.He bakes not only the aforementioned peach pie but also a breakfast muffin that elicits an orgasmic reaction from Adele of a kind not seen since Sally met Harry in the diner.What woman wouldnt swoon for a man like this even one who is sought by police and who is supposed to be doing 18 years hard time in jail for murder? A killing by the way that is tediously revealed through flashbacks -- but dont believe everything you read in the papersCue strings and flutes and quote Henrys admiring voice-over ""He did laundry he ironed and in return my mom taught him to rumba.""Killjoy cops and nosy neighbours natch wouldnt look so kindly upon this cosy setup judging it to be a toss-up between a kidnapping and harbouring of a fugitive.At no point does the movie convince us that Frank is the least bit dangerous. Fatally neither does it make us care about whether he and Adele will go from doing the rumba in the living room to the horizontal mambo in the bedroom.At this point I should admit that I liked Labor Day better and rated it higher when I first saw it at TIFF last September. Somehow it didnt seem quite as corny or ring so falsely as it did upon a repeat viewing.Reitman reminds us of the type of movie he usually makes in scenes where the nerdy Henry gets chatted up by the towns new girl (Brighid Fleming) a pistol from Chicago.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert ""Labor Day"" is a generic slab of escapist romantic Velveeta from of all people sharp-witted Jason Reitman. This insipidly sentimental hopelessly hokey entry sits uneasily beside his earlier films. ""Thank You for Smoking"" ""Juno"" ""Up in the Air"" and ""Young Adult"" were sardonic dramas that made uncompromising fun of modern life. Whether the subject was political lobbying teen pregnancy or corporate downsizing Reitmans films were calculated to ruffle orthodox feathers. Accuse him of what you will hes been innocent of sentimentality. Here working from Joyce Maynards novel he delivers a Harlequin-level potboiler so shameless it would make Nicholas Sparks blush. A dejected single mom named Adele (Kate Winslet) falls for a brawny dangerous stranger named Frank (Josh Brolin). Its 1987 and Adeles son Henry (Gattlin Griffith) narrates with insights more apt for a middle-aged lady novelist than a hormonal 13-year-old. ""I dont think losing my father broke my mothers heart but rather losing love itself"" he observes. He gives her homemade gift coupons for his services as Husband-for-a-Day. As 13-year-old boys do. Adele is so emotionally fragile she can scarcely put her car in gear for their monthly supply trip to the discount store. Cut to a close-up of her trembling hands. Its there that Frank appears before Henry as in a vision quietly insisting that he and his mom drive him somewhere so he can tend a suspicious-looking stomach wound. Franks hushed persuasion polite with undertones of threat convinces her to obey. He gruffly directs the pair to take him to their home and more or less takes them prisoner for the Labor Day weekend. LABOR DAY  out of 4 stars. Rated PG-13 for thematic material brief violence and sexuality. Its not the usual meet-cute where a couple bump heads in a taxi they both think they hailed but thus are surrogate father and surrogate family introduced. A TV report reveals that Frank is an escaped con. In fact a murderer. But a very hunky one so perhaps its all a misunderstanding? Illogically Franks own flashbacks of the fateful day work their way into Henrys telling of the story. The films middle passage suggests a kinky divorcees Beauty and the Beast fantasy. While Franks slab-of-beef masculinity has a threatening titillating edge -- he ties his half-willing accessory Adele to a chair to ""keep up appearances"" if the police arrive -- his only desire is to heal this emotional basket case. He cooks her a blue-ribbon chili and spoon-feeds her tenderly blowing each bite cool first as if she were an infant in a highchair. Let the trust-building and heart-fluttering begin. Soon -- absurdly soon -- Adele is won over by Franks take-charge machismo and Olympic-level housekeeping skills. As if hed been dreaming of nothing but chores in prison Frank tackles a honey-do list that would exhaust Hercules. He cleans the gutters chops wood re-mortars the homes foundation teaches Hank to throw a baseball repairs the car and bakes muffins that leave her agog. And he finds time to give a young disabled neighbor the best afternoon of his life. As escaped convicts do. He fixes her furnace and if that nod to her erotic reawakening is too subtle he gets his hands all slick and juicy making a peach pie. ""The filling is easy. I want to talk about crust"" he says. Huskily Adele observes ""Theres another kind of hunger. A hunger for human touch."" Cut to shot of pie oozing in the oven. Frank proves handy in the boudoir as well. Hes the perfect fantasy man. Best of all unlike Adeles remarried ex-husband (Clark Gregg) Frank cant leave. But they can all leave together traveling as a family to the Canadian border. As neighbors drop by and plot tripwires fire questions of Franks innocence are implausibly resolved en route to an ending more sugar-sweet and gooey than Franks pie. I recently saw a movie about a man falling in love with his computer operating system. It was more believable than this.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A reclusive woman and her young son reluctantly give shelter to an escaped convict. Rated PG-13 (sexuality adult themes) BOTTOM LINE This overeroticized drama gets so hot and bothered that it borders on camp. Intriguing and well-acted but often inadvertently funny. CAST Kate Winslet Josh Brolin Gattlin Griffith LENGTH 150 Thirteen-year-old Henry watches fascinated as a strange man ties up his mother in ""Labor Day"" Jason Reitmans dramatic thriller about love sex and danger. The man is Frank Chambers an escaped convict played by a beefy Josh Brolin and the mother is Adele Wheeler played by Kate Winslet in a breezy summer dress. As Franks ropes caress Adeles delicate wrists and plump calves all filmed in loving close-up young Henry (Gattlin Griffith) can feel the erotic tension in the air. Based on Joyce Maynards 2009 novel ""Labor Day"" is the story of a woman who falls in love with her captor. Like all bondage narratives -- whether hidden in a comedy like ""It Happened One Night"" or laid out plainly in a novel like ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" -- it feels both sexy and slightly sexist. Adele a withdrawn and depressed single mother is about as submissive as they come while Frank dominates her with not only rope but aggressive househusbandry. Once inside Adeles home Frank begins fixing old doors working on the car cooking mopping. Its Samp;M Norman Rockwell style. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Much of ""Labor Day"" feels comically heavy-handed as when Frank and Adele assume the ""Ghost"" position to mash up some squishy peach-pie filling but the actors maintain their dignity. Brolins menace softens but never quite fades while Winslet convincingly shows us a woman rediscovering her body and herself. Clark Gregg as Henrys Sundays-only father adds a touching note of real-world normalcy. ""Labor Day"" marks a departure for writer-director Reitman whose sharp-edged comedy-dramas have ranged from the snarky ""Juno"" to the brutal ""Young Adult."" This movies focus however seems fuzzy. The romance develops so suddenly (note the three-day weekend of the title) that we never quite believe it and several murky flashbacks suggest a twist that never satisfactorily arrives. The wistful narration from a now-grown Henry (Tobey Maguire in an odd cameo) feels borrowed from another film in an unrelated genre. With no deeper theme to reveal ""Labor Day"" seems unaware of its troubling Stockholm Syndrome subtext. Its also clearly oblivious to its camp potential. When Frank refires Adeles boiler youll have to supply your own jokes. 233 MoviesLabor Day trailer PLOT A reclusive woman and her young son reluctantly give shelter to an escaped convict. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (sexuality adult themes) CAST Kate Winslet Josh Brolin Gattlin Griffith LENGTH 150 BOTTOM LINE This overeroticized drama gets so hot and bothered that it borders on camp.

MoviesOscar nominees 2014 ----- Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff HOLIDAY FLICKS WORTH CELEBRATING With a title like ""Labor Day"" the new Kate Winslet drama probably should have opened in September. At least producers of these four box-office hits also named for a holiday had the smarts to open their films at the appropriate time of year. HALLOWEEN (1978) -- The first -- and best -- of the slasher series opened six days before Halloween. This horror treat also pulled a neat trick Though made for only 325000 to date its had a domestic gross of 47 million. GROUNDHOG DAY (1993) -- This Bill Murray charmer actually opened 10 days after Punxsutawney Phils big day but close enough.

LD-00360 Photo Dale Robinette Paramount Pictures Labor Day review Actors good but plot is labored 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Labor Day Drama. Starring Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin. Directed by Jason Reitman. (PG-13. 111 minutes.) In ""Labor Day"" a woman falls in love with the man who takes her hostage but the movie goes out of its way to make that journey easy for her. Hes an escaped convict but wouldnt you want to escape prison too? And hes a murderer except maybe hes not really a murderer just unfairly convicted. And sure he holds her captive in her own home but not for one minute do you ever think hes going to hurt her or her 12-year-old son. Shes depressed and rarely leaves the house. So how else is she going to meet a good-looking guy except in a hostage situation? And the son needs a father figure someone to show him how to swing a bat and change a tire. This is win-win for everybody but its too win-win - a setup that short-circuits drama that shoehorns a situation into a precooked formulation Hes a real prisoner and shes an emotional prisoner and each offers the other the possibility of freedom. If only ""Labor Day"" didnt make things so easy it might have been a better film. For example imagine if he really were dangerous - then falling in love would not be such a given. By cutting off every possible avenue that the story may travel but one writer-director Jason Reitman (""Up in the Air"" ""Young Adult"") makes the movies path discernible to all to the extent that we really do know everything before it happens sometimes a full hour before. The overall effect is drippy not emotional but sentimental. Still the situation has enough inherent drama and the performances enough truth that ""Labor Day"" maintains interest. Kate Winslet is Adele a shy divorced mother for whom a trip to the grocery store is a major excursion. She has lost all her confidence and most of her ability to face the world when she meets Frank (Josh Brolin) who with suggested threats makes his way into her car and then into her house. Outside theres a manhunt while inside Frank soon is making chili and baking peach pies. Throughout its as if the performances grounded in reality are in collision with the requirements of the story. Though its always a bit of a waste to cast Winslet as an introvert she brings a world of pain to Adeles every utterance just as Brolin brings the heavy aura of a tortured history to Frank. We believe he has been through hell and wants desperately to remain free and with this woman. So why oh why with a price on his head do they keep forgetting to lock the front door? And why oh why do they not pull down the shades? For that matter why does he hang out on the back porch serenading Adele on guitar? They cant ask the audience to take their problems seriously if they dont. With no obstacles to their forming a bond theres really not enough story to the Adele-Frank relationship to fill out a movie. And so Reitman who adapted Joyce Maynards novel gives us flashbacks both to Franks past and to Adeles past. These are unwelcome but even worse is the storys shift in favor of Adeles 12-year-old son (Gattlin Griffith) who develops a cliched friendship with a cliched sassy girl from the big city. The soundtrack is intrusive enough to notice. Sometimes its a single acoustic guitar mournfully noting the sadness of common folk. Sometimes its a reverb sound subliminally underscoring moments of tension except the effect isnt subliminal. ""Labor Day"" is a film of many faults. Yet even if we never fully believe in Adele and Frank we end up caring about them and thats some kind of achievement. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Comments click to enlarge Labor Day Video Rated PG-13  111 minutes  2014 Calling something a melodrama is a sneaky way of excusing its implausibilities on behalf of its juicy performances which in this case Im more than willing to do. Adapted from a novel by Joyce Maynard this romance strains credulity from the outset with its tale of an escaped convict (Josh Brolin) ingratiating himself with a lonely divorcee (Kate Winslet) and her unhappy son (Gattlin Griffith) over a long Labor Day weekend. But even as a bodice-ripping fantasy its pretty compelling Winslet knows how to play hunger Brolin is handsome and sincere and writer-director Jason Reitman (Up in the Air) shows a none-too-common restraint in never showing the characters in bed. There are some nice character turns as well from Clark Gregg J.K. Simmons James Van Der Beek and Brooke Smith. By J.R.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Dale Robinette) Labor Day Labor Day is a romance with an edge By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Jan 30 2014 (...) Dale Robinette This image released by Paramount Pictures shows Gattlin Griffith left Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet in a scene from ""Labor Day."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Dale Robinette) The lonesome divorcee and the seductive vagabond are recurring characters in romance novels but with ""Labor Day"" director Jason Reitman turns a Nicholas Sparks scenario into an Alfred Hitchcock creep-show. Although the violence is implied and illusory the twists and turns throughout this moody movie form a noose around our genre expectations.Adele (Kate Winslet doing what she does best) is the divorced depressed mother of sensitive tween Henry (Gattlin Griffith). They live in a decrepit old house in small-town New Hampshire. So when hunky-but-bleeding stranger Frank (Josh Brolin delivering his lines with cryptic diction) enlists Henrys help at the local discount store its the most momentous thing to happen to this fractured family since husband Gerald (Clark Gregg) ran off with his secretary.Frank is an escaped prisoner convicted of murdering his young wife many years earlier but even as he barges into Adeles home he assures her that he is a wrongly accused man and will not harm her or Henry. Yet in adapting a novel by Joyce Maynard director Reitman (""Up in the Air"") emphasizes Franks sexual dominance. The film has a thrumming almost subliminally threatening soundtrack. And in the scene where Frank provides the pliant Adele with a potential alibi in case the cops come gently tying her to a chair the Samp;M subtext becomes overt. The questions that this movie raises are strangely open-ended. Is Frank a forgivable answer to Adeles prayers because he can fix a squeaky staircase teach Henry how to hit a curveball and bake a peach pie? (The extended eroticized pie-baking scene is the most obvious nod toward the romance-novel demographic.) These questions might be easier to answer if we learned more about Franks background but the flashbacks to his crime are confusing and the story is narrated from Henrys perspective (with Tobey Maguire voicing his older self).Because the story is set in the 80s and Henry is a blank slate of emotional neediness (photographed like an ivory doll) ""Labor Day"" evokes absent-father stories such as Steven Spielbergs blockbuster ""E.T."" This confounding film might be too roughly textured for mass consumption but for audiences who arent bound by expectations the labor of chewing it over will be rewarded.

"Labor Day movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW Labor Day  Video Labor Day is not believable despite strong cast Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Labor Day"" starring Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet. (Posted on January 30 2014) Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Labor Day"" starring Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet. (Posted on January 30 2014) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The thesis of ""Labor Day"" taken from Joyce Maynards novel was summed up well by The Washington Post headline affixed to the Posts book review ""Sometimes its okay to pick up a scary drifter.""In the fictitious town of Holton Mills N.H. 13-year-old Henry has become the emotional caretaker for his depressed agoraphobic single mother Adele. Numerous miscarriages have eroded her sense of stability; monthly trips to the local supermarket are all she can handle. On one of those shopping trips Henrys confronted by a prison escapee Frank who is bleeding from the gut (he escaped during surgery) and is looking for a place to lie low for a while. Half-threateningly half-reasonably he persuades Adele to aid in his plan. Over an eventful and sun-dappled Labor Day weekend Frank reveals himself to be the honor-bound charismatic handyman of Adeles dreams. He teaches Henry to throw a baseball. He teaches a wheelchair-bound neighbor kid to play baseball. He changes the oil in Adeles station wagon. And in the most solemnly cringe-worthy scene of the new movie year Frank pries open Adeles and Henrys love-starved hearts with his stunning kitchen skills as he bakes his newfound makeshift family a peach pie with a crust so flaky and filling so photogenically luscious its as if he has become the star of his own show ""Top Chef Convicted Murderer Division.""We can buy a lot in fiction on the page. The movies make romantic balderdash easier to swallow in some ways but tougher in others. Writer-director Jason Reitmans studious adaptation of ""Labor Day"" has too much taste and high-minded respect for Maynards book to play up the pulpy exploitation angle. So were left with some first-rate actors doing what they can to fill every sensually fraught glance with trace elements of human character. Kate Winslet has such sound and reliable dramatic instincts (That Face doesnt hurt either) she very nearly makes something of Adele. Josh Brolin lets his mellow insinuating voice do the heavy lifting as tight-lipped Frank a hunky amalgam of Shane and a drifter out of an William Inge play. Gattlin Griffith is young Henry in the throes of confused adolescence; Toby Maguire provides the voice-overs as older Henry looking back at the Labor Day weekend of his youth when an escape to Canada was on the horizon and his feelings regarding Frank and Henrys amiable but distant birth father (Clark Gregg) made for some serious soul-searching.Reitman has made his considerable name on a peppy slick brand of comedy beginning with the gently satiric ""Thank You for Smoking"" moving on to ""Juno"" and ""Up in the Air"" though others prefer the meaner edge of his recent ""Young Adult."" ""Labor Day"" is Reitmans fifth feature and his first tonal misfire. For all his skills Reitman hasnt fully mastered the directors most important tool the BS detector. If he had he wouldnt have allowed composer Rolfe Kent to lard the films pie-baking sequence with the most egregiously sensitive solo guitar lines ever heard outside a freshman dorm room.mjphillipstribune.com""Labor Day"" - 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for thematic material brief violence and sexuality)Running time 151Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Jason Reitman Labor Day (movie) Labor Day Josh Brolin Young Adult (movie) Latest movie reviews REVIEW That Awkward Moment  REVIEW At Middleton  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising73deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-labor-day-0131-20140130,0,4623060.column",200,laborday27,laborday,chicagotribune

Area theaters. The credits say ""Labor Day"" was written and directed by Jason Reitman from Joyce Maynards novel. But that must be a mistake because surely this is a Nicholas Sparks movie? Lets compare the evidence. Reitman makes subversive dramedies about sharp teens (""Juno"") and disconnected adults (""Up in the Air"") who embrace their cynicism or inhumanity (""Thank You for Smoking""). Sparks writes swoony sun-dappled romantic fantasies (""The Notebook"") that serve as the cinematic equivalent of a candle-lit bubble bath (""Nights in Rodanthe"" ""Dear John""). Josh Brolin as a man on the run takes shelter with homemaker Kate Winslet. ""Labor Day"" recounts the swoony sun-dappled romantic fantasy of a lonely depressed single mother (Kate Winslet). Miraculously she finds true love in a mystery man (Josh Brolin) who not only sweeps her off her feet but voluntarily sweeps her floor. Case closed. Except there are signs that ""Labor Day"" is actually the work of an expert filmmaker what with the heartfelt performances and the well-curated 1980s setting. Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin take the field in Labor Day. So Reitman has decided to expand his repertoire -- and mostly he does it well. But make no mistake This is the best original movie Lifetime will never have the budget to make. Reitman is assisted by two pros who never treat the job as if its beneath them. Winslets sad exhausted Adele is doing her best to raise 13-year-old Henry (Gattlin Griffith). That changes on Labor Day weekend 1987 when an escaped prisoner (Brolin) takes shelter in their home. Josh Brolins con on the lam finds refuge with Kate Winslets single mom in Labor Day. Theyre terrified at first but Frank doesnt actually seem like such a bad guy. In fact its not long before hes doing their laundry teaching Henry how to play baseball and cooking dinner for his increasingly willing hostages. Once he shows Adele how to bake a peach pie it pretty much seals the deal. Shes found her soulmate Henrys got the new dad he needs and Frank embraces the opportunity to create a family after years in jail. Of course he is still a very wanted man (and not just by Adele). Every time Officer Treadwell (James Van Der Beek) drives by the house on lookout this unlikely idyll seems more and more tenuous. Kate Winslet Josh Brolin and Gattlin Griffith in Labor Day Tobey Maguires narration (as the adult Henry) is superfluous and the flashbacks of Franks past are awkwardly handled. But Brolin and Winslet develop a nice connection and we really do want to see their characters find happiness together. The leafy New England setting shot with appropriate but not ostentatious gauziness adds to the romantic appeal. Its just too bad Reitman himself takes the project so seriously. Hes too good to make a campy guilty pleasure so he winds up with lightweight escapism instead. From the guy who gave us the brilliant ""Up in the Air"" thats an undeniable comedown.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The year is 1987 but it feels more like 1957. The place is New England but it could be any anonymous American suburb. At a local convenience store depressed single mother Adele (Kate Winslet) and her 13-year-old son Henry (Gattlin Griffith) cross paths with Frank (Josh Brolin) a mysterious stranger who demands--gently almost politely but he isnt asking--that the two shelter him from the searching gaze of the law. Frank it turns out is an escaped convict and for a few fleeting minutes Labor Day throbs with danger. But the noir setup is a red herring Down a long and winding country road in a house Norman Rockwell might splash onto a canvas this unwanted houseguest shows his true colors. Hes no menace but rather the surrogate husband and father his captives have been waiting for. Soon Frank is mopping the floor fixing the squeak in the front door and--in the most howlingly funny seduction scene in recent memory--sensually squashing peaches into pie filling his mad baking skills an irresistible aphrodisiac for the lonely divorcee putting him up.Improbably this saccharine melodrama comes courtesy of Jason Reitman the Hollywood scion director who made Juno and Up In The Air. Clearly hes chasing a change of pace a hard right turn away from the sardonic redemption stories that have previously sported his byline and into the unfamiliar realm of Sirksian soap. But Labor Day drawn from the pages of a Joyce Maynard bestseller is a major miscalculation. Narrated by young Henry despite the fact that hes not privy to every plot turn or conversation the film awkwardly hybridizes its influences; theres a touch of Sam Mendes bombast (the swelling score) a hint of Spielbergian boyhood nostalgia (the prominently displayed E.T. poster) and even a light dash of Terrence Malick wonder (the wordless flashbacks). Reitman wants his movie to dually function as a thriller but his attempts at suspense are predicated on irrational behavior Adele and her son guiltily stammer and perspire whenever anyone intrudes upon their new domestic bliss whereas passing townsfolk--distractingly portrayed by famous actors--subject the two to constant crucibles of distrust. The drama rings as false as the romance.Despite its borderline-offensive assertion that a wanted potentially violent man of the house is better than no man of the house Labor Day is too fatally polite to incense. Its a mostly colorless weepie aiming for the mythic power of a Great American Novel but achieving dramatic vagueness instead. Who is Brolins cuddly fugitive come to mend this broken family by afflicting it with Stockholm syndrome but a walking cliche of saintly masculinity? And who is Winslets heroine deflated even when falling head over heels but ""damaged goods"" personified? No real sparks fly between the two probably because theyre playing stock types granted parallel traumatic backstories instead of personalities. On the other hand maybe the films true love story--perversely perhaps accidentally--is between a boy and his mother Before Frank saunters in Henry offers Adele ""husband for a day"" coupons failing to grasp which of her needs he cant satisfy; later the two lay together in a hammock Adele attempting to articulate to her offspring how sex feels. In nearly incestuous moments like these its as though theres a weirder film threatening to poke through Labor Days mundane surface like a fork breaching the golden-brown crust of one of Franks delectable pastries.

"Review Labor Day 2.5 stars Article Things to do >> Movies >> Article Review Labor Day 2.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Best Kate Winslet roles Kate Winslet interview By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Jan 29 2014 411 PM Jason Reitman directs Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin in ""Labor Day"" which sounds like a potent combination all the way around. If only it played out that way. Reitman whose credits include ""Juno"" and ""Up in the Air"" is a confident intriguing director. Brolin is an outstanding actor. Winslet is whatever the step beyond that is. But in this film for which Reitman wrote the script based on the Joyce Maynard novel they combine for a big stew of syrupy goo. Ever wonder what one of those Lifetime weepers would look like with a bigger budget and more talent? Now we know. Winslet plays Adele who lives with her young son Henry (Gattlin Griffith). Its 1987 the beginning of Labor Day weekend. Adele is so dispirited by her husband (Clark Gregg) leaving her years before that shes shut down rarely venturing outside her deteriorating house. ""I dont think losing my father broke my mothers heart but rather losing love itself"" the older Henry (Tobey McGuire) recalls in a voiceover -- gag -- and the seeds of a bodice-ripper are sown. One day Adele does manage to make it to town a monthly visit for supplies. Henrys looking at the comic books when a man named Frank (Brolin) appears bleeding and asks if Henry could help him. Henry takes Frank to Adele who even in her state knows better than to agree to drive a bleeding stranger anywhere. Frank puts his hand on Henrys neck and says ""Frankly this needs to happen."" That sounds sufficiently menacing particularly coming from an actor as good at it as Brolin. And so it does. A nervous Adele takes the wounded Frank to her home where with the tension becoming almost unbearable he threatens to ... OK actually that doesnt happen. If only. Instead Frank despite having escaped from prison where he was serving time on a murder conviction turns out to be the sweetest most-eligible hunk who ever hopped out of a hospital window and bolted. He changes the oil in the car. He cleans out the gutters. He teaches Henry to properly throw and hit a baseball. He ties up Adele gently so that if hes caught she can truthfully say he did and spoon-feeds her chili he whips up from ingredients lying around the kitchen. He is in the most obvious and ridiculous ways possible the man who has been missing in Adele and Henrys lives. And yes hes a fugitive too theres that. But to be truly happy mustnt we all overlook the shortcomings of others? The big set piece is when Frank teaches Adele and Henry how to make a peach pie. It is the kind of scene that might be perfect for a ""Saturday Night Live"" parody except theres no further a comedian could take it. The ripe moist fruit; the kneading of the fleshy dough; the hot sweaty afternoon SEX SEX SEX SEX. Honestly Reitman might as well have used title cards so blatantly does he spell it out. Events complicate an already complicated situation even further. (Brooke Smith is a welcome sight as a pushy nosy neighbor.) Dreams are hatched plans are made life savings are removed from bank accounts. Along the way were supposed to swoon but Frank is such a perfect dreamboat its impossible to take the whole thing seriously. The only thing that makes the movie even remotely satisfying is the acting. Say this for Brolin He tries. So too does Winslet who makes Adele about 1000 times more interesting than what she should be. Griffith is also good as Henry a confused boy not exactly wanting to idolize an escaped killer but not able to keep from doing so. But theyre simply elevating inferior material. Its a wonder Fabio never made this movie. Even with the talent involved almost everything about ""Labor Day"" plays less like something youd buy a ticket to watch and more like something youd buy in an airport bookstore to read.

Leave it to Kate Winslets warmth intelligence and sincerity to bring us out of the winter doldrums of January leftovers with Jason Reitmans nuanced keenly observed romantic drama Labor Day. Some pessimists stupidly dismissed it as a three-hankie womens picture when it was unveiled at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival in September but so what? It resonates with delicacy passion and restraint touching the heart in places where cynics fear to go. Carefully adapted by writer-director Mr. Reitman from the acclaimed novel by Joyce Maynard its the poignant story set in 1987 New England of a 13-year-old boys unconditional love for his lonely divorced mother a once-vibrant woman who has grown physically unkempt emotionally stagnant and sexually barren through loss and neglect. When her husband deserted them the boy (astonishing new kid on the block Gattlin Griffith) tried to take his fathers place giving his mother the love she lost and filling the empty space in her life with his own brand of devotion and affection. But Adele (a grippingly mature Ms. Winslet) has become so timid and reclusive that she rarely leaves the house except to buy supplies with the boy as her constant companion. On one of those excursions a stranger forces Adele and her son Henry into their station wagon at the shopping mall and convinces them to drive him to their derelict house in the woods. The man is Frank Chambers (played by a remarkably sensitive Josh Brolin who has grown astonishingly as an actor since his early days in teen spoofs and violent action programmers) an escaped convict wrongly serving 18 years for murder. Although his hostages cringe in terror this is no violent dime-store paperback criminal. Frank cooks minds the furnace waxes the floor and shows his captives the sort of kindness strength and presence theyve been missing for a long time. Frank originally promises to stay only until nightfall when he will make his getaway. But gradually their fear morphs into dependence trust and love. For five days over the Labor Day weekend their lives change forever. Told through the boys eyes the details of their story like the ingredients in the peach pie Frank teaches them to bake are assembled in flashbacks and memories narrated by Henry as a grown man. The pieces of a jigsaw that will seem to some as preposterous all come together in a satisfying and deeply touching third act that throbs with an understated depth of emotion rarely experienced in films today. With skillfully honed elements of a kidnapping thriller a coming-of-age story and a florid hothouse romance Labor Day delivers solid goods for every kind of audience. An astute social activist Mr. Reitman specializes in leavening serious subjects like unwed mothers (Juno) the economic crisis (Up in the Air) and the dangers of cigarettes (Thank You for Smoking) with humor. Labor Day is his first full-blown attempt to tackle the tender consequences of unconventional love and its the real deal. The results force us to grapple with different dynamics simultaneously The boy watches his mothers sensual rebirth with joy but is forced to rethink his weakened role in her life while struggling with his own blooming sexuality; the mother faces the inevitable separation that love with a convicted felon will bring; and the man learns to rise above his tense obstructive past mistakes and slowly reveal deeper dimensions of his hidden vulnerability. The metaphors enhanced by great acting and mirrored in the gorgeous images of Eric Steelbergs golden cinematography add up to a wrenching riveting and richly rewarding experience at the movies.

"Review Labor Day will steal your heart against all odds - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Labor Day will steal your heart against all oddsBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 01/29/2014 121500 PM PSTUpdated 01/30/2014 020414 PM PST Related StoriesJan 29Top 5 craziest film love stories everFor Winslet motherhood mingles with Labor DayI mustve gotten something stuck in my eye at the end of ""Labor Day.""Which was a pretty amazing turnabout considering that about an hour earlier I thought I was going to cry over what screenwriter/director Jason Reitman was trying to force down our throats with his adaptation of Oakland author Joyce Maynards novel of the same name. Get a load of this premiseA convicted murderer (Josh Brolin) escapes from prison and in what is surely the smoothest public kidnapping in cinematic history forces a an emotionally distraught woman (Kate Winslet) and her about-to-explode-into-puberty son (Gattlin Griffith) to take him home and tend to his wounds. He turns out to be the father the boy wants and the emotional savior the mother needs -- and a whole lot more handyman expert chef car mechanic and baseball coach all wrapped into one ruggedly handsome package with whom his victims start bonding mere hours after being snatched. This image released by Paramount Pictures shows Josh Brolin left and Kate Winslet in a scene from ""Labor Day."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Dale Robinette) ( Dale Robinette ) Oh and hes great with kids in wheelchairs -- and makes pies so sexy the food in the refrigerator scene in ""9 1/2 Weeks"" would be embarrassed to be in the same kitchen. Poor Brolin. Women everywhere will now beg him to kidnap them. Like Maynards novel ""Labor Day"" is set in mid-1980s New Hampshire (where she grew up). The main protagonist is 13-year-old Henry Wheeler whose main concerns in life are caring for his reclusive mother Adele (played with exceptional weariness and fragility by Winslet) and the tingly sensations hes suddenly getting when looking at girls. When the pair venture out shopping for school clothes theyre confronted by escaped and wounded prisoner Frank Chambers who calmly but firmly forces his way into their home while the small town around them buzzes with the manhunt. Advertisement Chambers initially wants to stay just until nightfall but then he starts cooking which becomes a near-embarrasing metaphor for love or sex depending on whose fingers are in the mixing bowl at any given time. So how does a film that likely would have Nicholas Sparks wincing during its first half-hour turn out to be such a guilty pleasure?Reitman is unapologetic in his goal of making you desperately want these poor people to come together in a world that despite its outward beauty (the cinematography makes you feel the sweaty weather coming off the screen) is full of unimaginable ugliness. The film just wont give up. Like a cheetah spotting a gazelle it hunts you and chases your emotions until you finally succumb. Despite being one of the most unbelievable plots in love story history its also one of the most emotionally magnetic. Thats why we go to the movies -- to see things that dont happen in real life and once in a while you have to give in. It doesnt hurt that the acting is first-rate the chemistry between Winslet and Brolin is enviable and theres just enough foreshadowing to pique ones interest as to how it will all play out and why these characters have come to need each other so badly and so quickly. ""Labor Day"" alternates between dream and nightmare realities that make it hard to predict whats coming next and eventually harder still not to care.To his credit Griffith doesnt overact in the role of middle-schooler Henry whose life is so inside-out its difficult for him to be anything but stone-cold confused (his ""girlfriend"" the wise big-city transplant Eleanor played by Brighid Fleming swipes every scene shes in). But as much as the story is told from Henrys point of view (narrated by Tobey Maguire who appears late in the film) ""Labor Day"" is really about whether two badly wounded people can recover from devastating loss and find a reason to live. Whether we get the ending we expect -- or want -- depends on whether were hopeless romantics or pay specific attention to all the ""Bonnie amp; Clyde"" talk between Henry and Eleanor. Either way Reitman -- who has given us ""Juno"" and ""Up in the Air"" -- has made a film that is unapologetic in its aim to rip your heart from your chest. And ""Labor Day"" does just that. Resistance is futile.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.Labor Day    Rating PG-13 (for thematic material brief violence and sexuality)Cast Josh Brolin Kate Winslet Gattlin Griffith Tobey Maguire Brighid FlemingDirector Jason ReitmanRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the last; Season 7 delay continuesReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

A certain kind of viewer is being targeted here the especially lonely attracted to scruffy manliness bad choices and homemade desserts. The film will do until Fifty Shades of Grey turns up. The more you think about Labor Day the more calculating it gets. The two leads do what they can with the sentimental material; its almost a miracle that neither turns red with embarrassment (though this isnt going first on their clip reels). The same cant be said for director-writer Jason Reitman whose sharp cynical snap is nowhere to be felt. Love or hate Reitmans stuff (Juno Up in the Air) he definitely has a style one hes apparently got no qualms about abandoning to make mushy mommy movies.

"Review Reitmans Labor Day is lovely but weighed down by the past - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Reitmans Labor Day is lovely but weighed down by the past ""Labor Day"" Dale Robinette / Paramount Pictures Josh Brolin is Frank and Kate Winslet is Adele in ""Labor Day."" Josh Brolin is Frank and Kate Winslet is Adele in ""Labor Day."" (Dale Robinette / Paramount Pictures) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Sometimes the past trips you up. It certainly does Frank the escaped con played by Josh Brolin in Jason Reitmans new drama ""Labor Day."" It definitely unravels Adele the reclusive single mother Kate Winslet makes so fragile. It is already a defining factor for 13-year-old Henry played by newcomer Gattlin Griffith by the time Frank comes into their lives.What I didnt anticipate is the way the past might trip up the filmmaker. ""Labor Day"" is only Reitmans fifth movie but one of the distinguishing features in his films -- from 2006s ""Thank You for Smoking"" through ""Juno"" in 2007 ""Up in the Air"" in 2009 and 2011s ""Young Adult"" -- is how carefully constructed they are. The dialogue may be loose the characters quite frequently a mess but the progression of the film from beginning to end and the narrative links are always solid. Theyve all drawn critical attention with ""Juno"" and ""Up in the Air"" earning Reitman four Oscar nominations two for directing one for writing and another for best picture.On ""Labor Day"" he stumbles. PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Kenneth TuranThough the characters have the kind of flaws Reitman is at ease exploring the film is a departure in several ways. Instead of the contemporary vibe he captured so effortlessly before ""Labor Day"" is set in a small New Hampshire town circa 1987 and carries the ethos of a period piece. Then there is the matter of the past which haunts the film.The creative team does its part to set the tone. Cinematography is handled by Eric Steelberg who has worked with the director from the beginning with frequent collaborators Steve Saklad on production design and Danny Glicker on costumes. And in a year of excellent movie scores British composer Rolfe Kent contributes another one.What unfolds over the long hot holiday weekend is beautifully told and beautifully acted by Winslet Brolin and Griffith. Tobey Maguire as narrator and in a cameo as a grown-up Henry adds another nice touch. It is the flashbacks that are a muddle. ""Labor Day"" is based on the bestselling novel by Joyce Maynard a deceptively slim volume graced by extremely complicated characters. All have deeply fraught histories important in explaining how love blooms between a cautious mother and the convict holding her hostage. While Maynard so effectively tossed in scraps here and there they are more problematic on screen. Visual memory fragments are dropped in to explain how a series of miscarriages scarred Adele and a cheating wife led to Franks murder charge.PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Betsy SharkeyThe difficulty is the gauzy half-dreamlike style of them -- seductive to look at but more confusing than clarifying. It doesnt help that Winslet plays her younger self while Tom Lipinski steps in to portray Frank as a young man. There is no issue with Lipinskis performance; he has a brooding sensibility that is a good match for Brolins. But it is still hard to follow the narrative thread without having read the book.Yet if you can get past the past which I recommend what is left is a lovely intimate film about longing and love. It begins at a Pricemart exactly the kind of low-cost superstore the name implies when Frank asks Henry for help. The blood on his scalp and the limp make it clear he is a wounded man. Of course not all of his wounds are visible.Soon Adele is driving Frank and Henry back home. She puts up a little resistance but as the film has already made clear most of her emotional energy was expended merely getting out of the house. The real world holds too many painful reminders.The film finds its footing as the weekend progresses and the temperature and tension -- outside and in -- rise. There is the ever-present fear that Frank will be found. And there are other tight spots to be navigated the neighbor who drops by unexpectedly a friend who needs Adele to watch her disabled son for a day and Henrys flirtation with Eleanor (an excellent Brighid Fleming) the new girl in town messing with his mind and emerging libido.The emotional center of the film is found in the insular world of Adeles house as the trio fall in love -- with the idea of family and one another. This is when the reading between the lines the film requires is wrought in captivating ways.The gentleness between characters is surprisingly touching; it makes the pain of a harsh remark cut more deeply. The moments feel simple but are filled with complexities -- the way tossing a baseball can bond a man and a boy or making a pie together can express love and desire. The emotional and sexual interplay between Adele and Frank captures the idea of need with a sensitivity and insight that is rare on screen -- a reminder of how good Reitman can be when he gets it right.Labor DayMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic material brief violence and sexualityRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesPlaying At ArcLight Hollywoodbetsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Labor Day (movie) Adele (music artist) Jason Reitman Josh Brolin Kate Winslet Kenneth Turans best feature films of 2013 Review Scorsese DiCaprio go hunting in Wolf of Wall Street Review August Osage County dysfunction doesnt play on film stage Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-labor-day-movie-review-20131227,0,1379409.story#axzz2ogJP7M9S",200,laborday36,laborday,latimes

Although his names on the poster its impossible to believe that the sardonic boy wonder of Juno Thank You for Smoking and Young Adult would direct this stilted romance between a divorcee and a dreamboat escaped convict. Labor Day is so self-conscious and phony it must be the work of a pod person. Humans film lovers and fans of Reitmans till-now-flawless filmography Weve gotta fight back. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The plot of Labor Day would make a great Upworthy article. Let me suggest a title ""I Never Thought Id Want My Mom to Love a Murderer Until I Met This Bloody Hunk."" After Dad (Clark Gregg) ditches the family for his secretary 13-year-old Henry (Gattlin Griffin) and mom Adele (Kate Winslet) retreat from the world.Adele is one hand tremor away from a nervous breakdown; the boy is a shy soulful nerd forced to parent himself and fill his fathers shoes. Too sheltered to distinguish between adorable and inappropriate for her birthday he presents Mom with a homemade coupon book titled ""Husband for a day.""Film Details Labor Day RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time111 min. More Info For the cloistered duo the first weekend in September is its own holiday-within-a-holiday Taking Henry back-to-school shopping is one of the rare times Adele leaves their dilapidated house. As she frets over his pant size Henry meets a gut-wounded prison escapee named Frank Chambers (Josh Brolin) who takes one glance at frail Adele and grunts ""She looks like the kind of person who can help me."" He means hide him from the police. But something in this fugitives eyes says hes the kind of guy who deserves a good massage. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm With a squeeze of Henrys neck Frank strongly encourages Adele to take him home where he engages in a bit of light bondage by binding her hands and feeding her homemade chili. (What is this Fifty Shades of Bobby Flay?) The music frets as if he may still eat her liver for dessert. But like Hannibal Lecter Frank Chambers is fictional nonsense -- a handsome quasi-kidnapper who promptly decides to change the oil wax the floors grout the cellar quiet a whiny door bake fabulous homemade biscuits and teach Henry to play catch.In the most snortworthy scene the three of them team up to make a peach pie. Frank is so domestic that he calls the crust ""putting a roof on the house"" and together the insta-family members shove their six hands into the fruit. (Maybe theyve mistaken it for an Ouija board that can summon Franks ex-wife to explain why he was convicted of her murder.) Finally we have a male parallel to the hooker with a heart of gold. Why should Adele call the cops when shes lucked into a Husband for a Holiday Weekend?Reitman adapted the Labor Day screenplay from a novel by Joyce Maynard the memoirist best known for shacking up with J.D. Salinger when she was 18. Maynard once fell in love with an inmate named Lucky -- or at least convinced herself she did enough to write about their correspondence for Vogue -- but their relationship never proceeded past being pen pals. She pulled the cord when Lucky said he was coming to visit. (Plus she admitted he was ugly.) Good-looking Josh Brolin a man born to give a gal a sexy squint feels born of those brief letter-writing fantasies. Not only is he too perfect to exist on Earth hes too flawless even for Hollywood fiction sticking out of every scene like glossy CGI.Its disheartening watching Winslet and Brolin give their all to parts that could have been filled by anyone on the Hallmark Channel. This cant be the movie they were expecting when they signed on to a new flick by the director of Young Adult and the novelist behind To Die For two bleak acid-perfect romances. At least Winslets tremors earned her a Golden Globe nomination though she could score that with a Vine of herself tying her shoes.As our narrator is a 13-year-old child of divorce with only a vague understanding of adult love Winslets blooming has to take second billing to Henrys adolescent concerns namely impressing the brash new girl in town (Brighid Fleming) who instantly orders him to emancipate himself from his parents. Were supposed to ignore that the two kids are hanging out at a public library on a Sunday on a holiday weekend but after the midway point in this mess -- around when the camera filter changes from old-teabag brown to the color of hope -- everyone is acting so illogically that we cant be bothered to add Labor Days disregard of governmental opening hours to its list of sins.Besides we could all learn one thing from Frank ""Pie crust is a very forgiving thing"" he purrs. ""You can make all kinds of mistakes but you cant forget the salt."" Fine Reitman. Well give you another chance.

About Time Director Richard Curtis Not Every Love Story Begins with a Nazi and a Socialist Writer-director Jason Reitman adapting the novel by Joyce Maynard has a bad habit of telling us what hes already shown us in this sappy romance If ""Labor Day"" teaches us anything its that the line between a prestige-soaked year-end awards bait movie and a Lifetime original with a title like ""My Captor My Lover"" is blurry at best. The latest from Jason Reitman (""Up in the Air"") may have Oscar winners and nominees on both sides of the camera but for all its ambitions of being a new ""All That Heaven Allows"" it cant quite avoid the stink of Harlequin Romance. Writer-director Reitman adapting the novel by Joyce Maynard gives us a glimpse at the more interesting movie this material might have yielded The camera tells us almost everything we need to know about the characters inner lives their yearnings and their heartbreak. Unfortunately audiences apparently cant be trusted to pay attention so Reitman pours on unnecessary narration (provided by Tobey Maguire) that rarely adds anything that the movie hasnt already told us. Rather than choose to show us or tell us ""Labor Day"" all too frequently does both to the films detriment. And if the narration wasnt enough Rolfe Kents insistent score lets us know exactly what were supposed to be feeling every time it comes surging up. Also read Josh Brolin Bakes a Pie in Labor Day - The Sexiest Movie Scene Since Ghost? In 1986 Henry (Gattlin Griffith) lives with his severely depressed mother Adele (Kate Winslet) who has never quite recovered from her divorce from Henrys father (Clark Gregg). Henry does the bulk of the caretaking on her behalf while she exists in a limbo unto herself. (Its telling that the first time we see her attempt to drive a car she doesnt know to take it out of neutral.) With a new school year impending and Henry having grown too big for his pants the two of them make their way to a local department store and thats where they meet Frank (Josh Brolin) who convinces them to take him in. Turns out that Frank is a convicted murderer who escaped from a hospital after an appendectomy and he needs a place to hide out until his suture has healed. At first Henry and Adele are terrified but it quickly becomes clear that Frank has a heart of gold making himself handy around the house as a fix-it man surrogate dad (he teaches Henry to play baseball) cook (he whips up a batch of chili and then later a peach pie in a sequence that does for fruit what ""Ghost"" did for clay) mechanic and eventually lover to Adele. Also read Last Vegas Review Robert De Niro + Michael Douglas + Morgan Freeman = Grumpy Old Hangover The reclusive mother and son find themselves willingly aiding and abetting this felon as flashbacks begin to clue us in more and more about Franks unhappy past. Will they run off and form a family together or will the enclosing arms of the law shatter their dreams of bliss? ""Labor Day"" ventures into fairly sudsy territory and Reitman takes such an unironic viewpoint that it turns the whole thing into a very safe lady fantasy about a brooding stranger with a haunted past who rekindles the fires of love in a damaged (but beautiful) heroine. Its like ""Picnic"" with a manhunt and that damn narration just makes it worse. Also read 12 Years a Slave Review A Captivating Harrowing Historical Horror Show Still the actors are fairly blameless here doing what they can to turn types into actual characters. Winslet doesnt overplay the broken-spirit business and Adeles blossoming under Franks ministrations never plays like a standard issue movie sexual awakening. As the magical fugitive Brolin maintains an underlying sense of danger for as long as the film will allow. Beautifully shot by Reitmans frequent director of photography Eric Steelberg and starring top-flight actors ""Labor Day"" clearly intended to be more than the softest-of-the-softcore cry-porn it wound up being.

"Toronto Film Festival Diary Kate Winslet Near Her Worst Sandra Bullock at Her Best << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Toronto Film Festival Diary Kate Winslet Near Her Worst Sandra Bullock at Her Best George Pimentel/WireImage Movies September 11 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Most people come to Toronto looking for the best the movies can do. Many films will reach for greatness. Few will attain it. Then there are movies that dont even reach. Theyre armless This year one of those movies asks you to believe Kate Winslet as a shut-in single mother who comes out of her shell after Josh Brolin escapes from prison and holds her and her son hostage in their New England house. Hes not really holding them hostage. And theyre not hostages for long. Hes doing home repairs and fixing the car and in one of the most ludicrous moments Ive seen in any movie in many years showing mother and son how to make a pie. Everybodys hands mix the peach filling. There are more loving shots of that pie cooking in the oven than there are of Winslet. This movies a drama called Labor Day. It opens Christmas Day and is based on a highly implausible 2009 novel by Joyce Maynard whose memories of her affair with J.D. Salinger give the execrable new documentary about Salinger its only drama. And the screenwriter and director is Jason Reitman and wherever he seemed to be headed after Up in the Air and Young Adult its a shame to see him responsible for a movie so flavorless and that makes so little sense. This is the kind of movie that requires a lot of people -- Tobey Maguire Brooke Smith James Van Der Beek -- to ignore common sense. Reitman seems taken with the florid pretensions of Maynards story particularly her coming-of-age framing. Yes even with strategically dispersed flashbacks we never know exactly whats going on with Winslet and Brolin because most of the film is told from the point of view of a seventh-grader which Im sad to report is just about the emotional level of this movie. You know how satires of award shows have fake clips of actors performing earnest-looking nonsense (like a mom and son baking a pie with an escaped convict)? Thats Labor Day a movie so blandly absurd it could only be a joke on bland absurdity.

I saw a movie with arms this morning. Big steroidally strong arms arms that reached for the sky and wound up touching satellites. I saw Alfonso Cuarons Gravity. It opens in three weeks but for now Ill just say holy shit. Its just an hour and a half of pop moviemaking (Sandra Bullock and George Clooney space-lost and in 3-D) but its moviemaking conducted at such a high level of care and craftsmanship and consideration for what we want from a movie at every level that it obviates nearly every Hollywood blockbuster released in the past 18 months. Even with a film Im loving at some point Im taking notes. With Gravity I reached for my pen and didnt know what to write. Thats because I couldnt concentrate on anything beyond what Cuaron had put on the screen which is state-of-the-art special effects and eventually Bullock at the tippy top of her Bullockness (the dramedy of determination defeating self-doubt). On the way out a mildly unimpressed guy asked his friend of Bullock ""Do you think shell ever top Speed?"" ""She just did"" said his friend. But the first guy was skeptical ""I dont knooooow ...""

Dowd and Ben Kenigsberg Sep 11 2013 120 PM Share Tweet Share Tweet Canadas own Jason Reitman was a festival darling at TIFF right from the get-go having been the subject of a distribution squabble with his first feature Thank You For Smoking in 2005 and then returning to feed the fests hungry Oscar machine with Juno (2007) and Up In The Air (2009). This year he hosted a live reading of the screenplay for Boogie Nights an event that featured Jesse Eisenberg reading the role of Dirk Diggler and Dakota Fanning as Rollergirl. I wasnt there but it sounds like a better time than watching Reitmans new film Labor Day (Grade C-) which suggests the experience of being pelted with a thousand supermarket paperbacks at once. Veering away from the prickly tonal complexity of Young Adult--a female Greenberg centered on a courageously off-putting Charlize Theron performance--Reitman has taken a stab at bald-faced melodrama trolling viewers with an almost comical onslaught of cliches. Based on a well-regarded 2009 novel by Joyce Maynard Labor Day signals its awfulness right from the opening credits a slow breeze through suburbia set to an oppressively doleful Rolfe Kent score. We meet a child of divorce (Gattlin Griffith) living with his lonely mom (Kate Winslet). Dad (Clark Gregg) ran off with his secretary an act his son still resents. On a trip to the store with his mom the boy meets an escaped murder convict (Josh Brolin) who threatens them into taking him back to their house and soon becomes a handy guy to have around. He plays baseball He bakes great apple pies He knows the importance of being able to fix a flat tire The sentimentality stifles even as great an actress as Winslet whos given little to do but pine and cry and the miserablist pile-on of the backstories pushes Labor Day toward the realm of exploitation. Reitmans movie is an exercise in aggressive familiarity. The most de-familiarzing film in Toronto by far is Jonathan Glazers Under The Skin (Grade A-) which--with its daisy-chain Holy Motors-like structure--sometimes resembles installation art more than a theatrical feature. Thats not an insult in this case. Opening by quoting 2001 A Space Odyssey and featuring long stretches of total abstraction its the most ambitious film here throwing out the rules of conventional structure in a way that takes some getting used to. This is hardly the first film to observe an alien encountering strange customs but it may be the first that seems conceived from that perspective formally as well as dramatically. After landing on Earth and slipping into the skin of a human woman Scarlett Johanssons space creature drives around Scotland picking up various men whose rapid vocal interjections are looped in a way that makes them sound like another language (at least to an American). Not only does Johansson misunderstand what she sees--for instance asking a man with a profound facial deformity why he doesnt have a girlfriend unaware that shes being hurtful--but she seems to experience it through imperfect stimuli. The soundtrack courtesy of a hypnotically strange score by Mica Levi would be a mesmerizing experience on its own. Under The Skin is shot in a low-grade underlit digital style and Glazer suggested at a Qamp;A that the film involved a fair bit of improv with Johansson venturing into actual Scottish locales among non-actors. The movie is bound to be a polarizing experience likely to at times irritate even viewers who admire it. (There are stretches that come a bit close to Matthew Barney for my tastes.) But its rare to see a film that isnt even readily assimilated let alone processed. At the festival Under The Skins blindsiding ambition stands in stark contrast to Gravitys dramatic conservativeness. Richard Ayoades second feature as director The Double (Grade B-) is a loose reworking of Dostoyevsky in the idiom of Brazil and Soderberghs Kafka. The film makes terrific use of Jesse Eisenbergs twin modes nebbish and asshole casting him in the roles of both a meek analytics expert and his confident glad-handing new co-worker. No one notices that the two men look exactly the same and the caddish new guy first helps Eisenberg No. 1 then stymies him in his efforts at initiating romance with a co-worker (Mia Wasikowka). Theres not a whole lot to this version of The Double but its visual comedy and offhand surrealism make it a mild pleasure. Hany Abu-Assads Palestinian feature Omar (Grade C+) is also in a different way about duality as the eponymous protagonist who participates in a plot to shoot an Israeli soldier is arrested and then co-opted into spying on his comrades. Though it effectively documents the paranoia and compromise that are part and parcel of life in the occupied territories its not as strong a film as Paradise Now (2005) which more urgently and ambiguously zeroed in on its suicide-bomber protagonists as they neared a moment of action. And the last beat however preordained is destructive--seemingly an active endorsement of violence. --Ben Kenigsberg Any time a narrative feature with a story and characters and everything gets relegated to Wavelengths TIFFs multi-program slate of experimental cinema work its safe to assume that the film in question may be a little... challenging. So as I filed into Jackman Hall yesterday for the nearly three-hour new movie by Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-Liang who made the relatively accessible What Time Is It There? about a decade ago and a string of increasingly inaccessible films in the years since I was fully prepared for a tough sit. (Some of the reviews from Venice compounded this expectation.) Its a pleasure then to report that Stray Dogs (Grade A-) is not some impenetrable endurance test at least for those attuned to the directors strategy of holding on an image for what can sometimes feel like a small eternity. Looking beyond its epic long takes Tsais latest is small and human and primal--a howl from the gutter and a survival story about life on the fringe in which a family of four ekes out an existence one day and scavenged meal at a time. Certainly theres more to grasp onto here than there was in Face the filmmakers previous full-length effort which would have made a fine Wavelengths selection too. Whereas that beguiling curiosity trafficked in symbolic abstraction and nutty non sequiturs Stray Dogs is as stripped bare as the water-damaged abandoned building its characters sometimes call home. The father played by Tsai perennial Lee Kang-Sheng works as a ""human billboard"" in Tapei standing at busy intersections in pouring rain or otherwise. (Bitter bitter irony Hes advertising for a real-estate company but has no shelter of his own.) His latchkey kids real-life siblings (and Tsai godchildren) Lee Yi-Chieh and Lee Yi-Cheng spend many of their afternoons alone. Sometimes they accompany their mother to work. Wait is she their mother? In his most enigmatic move Tsai casts three different actresses in the role. (For a few baffling minutes I wondered if there was another woman in the fathers life.) Stray Dogs is basically plotless at least if one describes plot as forward motion for the characters. Lee and his family live day to day and the film unfolds as a series of snapshot vignettes of what they call a life--scrounging for sustenance climbing into trees to sleep washing themselves in a public restroom etc. Theres a cumulative power to Tsais vision of perseverance and decay; the plight of this struggling family unit weighs more heavily on the heart with each passing minute. Anyone who lives or works in a big city can attest to how easy it is to become conditioned to the peripheral sight of abject poverty. Callous as it sounds homelessness is a fact of urban existence one that those on the other side learn to process--through a mixture of familiarity and willful emotional distancing--as another part of the texture of the city. Stray Dogs fights tooth and nail one glorious long take at a time against such turning of blind eyes. Yes there are a few moments that veer dangerously close to self-parody as when Lee expresses his anguish by caressing suffocating and finally devouring a doll his children have made out of a head of cabbage. But this is also the rare marathon-length art film that seems to grow less oppressive the longer it goes on thanks to the flood of empathy it increasingly provokes. The final scene is one of those all-or-nothing moments of transcendence a very long stare into the void that will leave those watching either hopelessly impatient or emotionally spent. Even as I struggled to grasp the full significance of the image Stray Dogs ends on the full force of its compassion bowled me over. Its a fiercely humanistic movie. As something of a superfan of the expressive French auteur Claire Denis (Beau Travail 35 Shots Of Rum) it pains me a bit to confess that I was probably just a little too festival-fatigued to completely follow her latest act of elegant obfuscation Bastards (Grade B). One of the grand pleasures of watching a Denis movie is leaning in and paying close attention; admirably allergic to expository dialogue the director puts great trust in her audience to sort out the nature of onscreen relationships. Perhaps too much trust in this case Chronologically non-linear though not as bafflingly so as The Intruder this grim tale of exploitation takes its time revealing how its various characters--including a ship captain (Vincent Lindon) a cruel mogul (Michel Subor) and a traumatized teenage girl (Lola Creton)--are all connected. Putting the puzzle pieces together may be more rewarding than seeing the big picture. But while plenty have complained about the mundane nature of the story once all its layers of misdirection have been peeled back theres a potent whiff of Chinatown-grade outrage to the ending. Denis has made a movie about how powerful men take what they want from the world; one need not have the whole thing figured out to be shaken by its horror and dismay. Also pixels suit the director just fine; she exploits the textures of digital just as seductively as she did the grain of celluloid. Save some credit for regular cinematographer Agnes Godard who expertly captures the allure and danger of night. Improbably sandwiched between these two uncompromising world-cinema visions like a piece of expired baloney between two slices of fine gourmet bread was the TIFF premiere of Joseph Gordon-Levitts cartoonish directorial debut Don Jon (Grade C+). The actor-turned-filmmaker casts himself as a muscular mook who falls for Scarlett Johanssons ""perfect 10"" club girl but cant quite shake his pathological need for pornography. A broad comic sideshow of Jersey Shore caricatures the movie at the very least sidesteps the moralizing message it seems to be building towards. (The heros problem isnt that he jerks off too much but that hes never actually connected to someone through sex.) As an actor JGL fails to completely transform the titular character into a real human being. As a director he leans much too heavily on fast-cut repetition--hes no Edgar Wright--though a running gag about the sound of a laptop booting up is pretty inspired. A few days ago I wrote about how a more conventional American movie can feel like a breath of fresh air when programmed alongside punishing festival fare. Sometimes however said movie just ends up looking even less substantial by comparison. Tsai Ming-Liang it turns out is a hard act to follow. --A.A.

Movies | Inside Movies Toronto 2013 Alfonso Cuarons hypnotic Gravity is the space odyssey as head trip by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Enlarge Photo Close Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Film Images) Gravity Posted September 8 2013 -- 1030 AM EDT A paradox of watching special-effects films in the all-fantasy-all-the-time CGI era is that you can go to the movies every week especially in the summer and experience things that really ought to seem magical - a man of steel zipping through the air an endless zombie army shimmying over a wall cracks opening in the earth as the world ends - and as entertaining as much of this stuff is none of it at heart leaves you truly deeply amazed because eye-popping visual miracles have become so routine that theyre simply the new normal. (How far weve evolved from the days of ""Youll believe a man can fly"") But when you watch Gravity a tale of floating astronauts starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney set in what used to be called outer space (and now might be called 600 kilometers over the earth) you may find yourself thinking over and over again ""How the heck did they do that?"" Its not because youre seeing anything thats all that outrageously fanciful. Gravity though its set in space isnt really science fiction. Its a drama built around the technology of space travel as it more or less exists today. Whats astonishing about the film is its hypnotic seamlessness - the way that the director Alfonso Cuaron using special effects (and 3D) with a nearly poetic simplicity and command places us right up there in space along with the people on screen. Gravity opens with an extended shot of the earth looking gorgeously luminescent and real against the vast black nothingness and we hear radio burbles of talk between the astronauts and Houston. Then slowly almost imperceptibly a spacecraft enters our view from the right side of the screen - its a shuttle and the astronauts as we gradually come to realize are walking in space outside of it trying to repair a problem on the ship. Youll almost surely be reminded of 2001 A Space Odyssey because what Cuaron echoes from Kubricks great film - and what still seems haunting and novel in an outer-space movie - is the creeping rhythm of space the anti-gravity that places everything in a trance turning the ""action"" into a kind of moment-to-moment semi-slow motion a feeling of life suspended. As the camera drifts every bit as slowly as the astronauts gliding and dancing around them as they grab onto the ship to position themselves the effect of the sequence - and indeed of the entire movie - is to make us feel like were watching a single unbroken shot. At any given moment we may think we know how Cauron brought this off (he used CGI images he shot the actors in a studio and so forth) but whats thrilling about Gravity is the hallucinatory you are there sensation of free-floating cosmic rootlessness that the movie creates over time. Thats true even as were immersed in the quirky banality of the repair work or as we listen in on the jaunty ""office"" banter between Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) a veteran astronaut whos been walking in space so long that hes starting to feel like he belongs there and Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) a medical engineer whos still a relative newbie in space (shes struggling to keep her lunch down). But then theres a bulletin from Houston Due to an exploding Soviet satellite a bunch of debris is about to come flying at them and so they have to get inside the ship and abort the mission. Its too late though The debris shower hits them full force (the 3D places us right in the hurtling metal thick of it) tearing apart the ship. Seconds later there is no ship. They are lost in space. Gravity is a tale of survival and its suspense emerges from an implicit pact that Cuaron through the amazing verisimilitude of his staging makes with the audience. The movie is basically telling us that it wont cheat that the way the characters are going to get out of this if they do will be something that we can believe. The ebb and flow of Gravitys story is deeply organic - it seems to be making itself up as it goes along and thats how it hooks us. Yet because Gravity unlike the majority of science fiction doesnt hit us over the head with incidents what sustains our absorption in the movie is a rather tricky synthesis between our basic involvement in the plight of the characters and our head-scratching wonder at the awesome technological matter-of-factness with which the film brings the realities of space - the floating scariness of it the mysterious cluttered interiors of foreign satellites - to life. The two actors are sensational Clooney looking amusingly like Buzz Lightyear with a haunting chivalry beneath his bluster and Bullock as desperate and resourceful and anxious and brave and as primed to live as Sigourney Weaver in the last half of Alien. By the end of this year more than one commentator will surely have noted that Gravity creates an eerie bookend with All Is Lost the upcoming Robert Redford man-adrift-at-sea drama that is also in a very different way a marvel of organic filmmaking. What these movies are telling us perhaps is that we all feel a little adrift these days and that we want nothing so much as to get back home.     Four years ago the best movie I saw in Toronto - the best movie I saw all year - was Up in the Air Jason Reitmans sharply funny and melancholy screwball romantic comedy that was also a gut-punching snapshot of the downsizing era that was also a study of the charisma of George Clooney an actor so magnetically centered that his very presence raised the question Did he really need someone else to complete him? (The answer was yes but a hard-won yes.) Up in the Air did so many things at once and did all of them so well that it convinced me that Reitman had the talent to be a new-style old-fashioned mainstream Hollywood master - a Howard Hawks or Billy Wilder for the post-ironic age. Ive been waiting ever since for him to make good on that promise. But its starting to look like I may have to wait a long time. Two years ago Reitman delivered his follow-up film Young Adult starring Charlize Theron as a divorced author of YA fiction who had never gotten over her old boyfriend (Patrick Wilson) so she went back to her hometown and stalked him even though he was married with a kid and had no real interest in her. The movie was witty and sincere yet it was also trivial - the story of a basket case who persists in embarrassing herself which is fine (a little honest bad behavior can be just what movies need) except that she didnt really learn anything so the film seemed to circle around itself until it just sort of gave in and ended. Coming after Up in the Air Young Adult was no post-big-hit slump but I thought of it as Reitmans highly watchable post-big-hit trifle. Now after two more years Reitman has returned to Toronto with Labor Day adapted from a 2009 novel by Joyce Maynard and its the sweetest damnedest soggiest thing Reitmans lushly crafted version of a Lifetime movie set in 1987 in a lovingly photographed leafy New England small town with Kate Winslet as a depressed single mother whose life with her son (Gattlin Griffith) is interrupted - or more accurately completed - when the two are taken hostage in their clapboard home by an escaped prisoner played by Josh Brolin as a scowling macho in a Stanley Kowalski T-shirt but with a heart of TV-movie gold. How do we know how nice a guy he is? He never does anything thats even slightly unstable or off. The scene that seals the deal though is when he shows Kate and her son how to make a peach pie. His recipe and technique for the dough is a homespun dream and when he and Kate fuse their fingers on the sweet slimy peaches the movie lingers on this overly telegraphed moment of ""erotic"" baking as if it were the potters-wheel orgasm of Ghost as staged by Martha Stewart. Shot for gauzy shot scene for sentimental scene Labor Day feels like the exact movie Jason Reitman wanted to make which raises the question Why exactly did he want to make it? Hes an extraordinarily deft and sensitive filmmaker yet his gift for staging now so outstrips his instinct for choosing material that Im tempted to say that he needs a new agent or a new screenwriter (i.e. someone other than himself) or a new something that will shake him up. The period detail is as fussed over as anything on Mad Men Inside a grocery store every last item from the cans of Fanta on the shelf to the cards on a bulletin board looks like it came from the dowdy 80s. When we finally learn why the Winslet character is so depressed its affecting and I can appreciate that Reitman wants to tell stories that reach out and touch the women in the audience. But must he do so by turning a character like Brolins convict into such a noble scowling angel-man? Im all for sincerity in filmmaking but the quality that has defined Reitmans best movies - Up in the Air Juno and Thank You For Smoking - is audacity and he really needs to get that back.

Dev Patel all is forgiven for Chappie with The Man Who Knew Infinity Canadas Guy Maddin shows off his genius in The Forbidden Room I returned for the first time in three years to the old Varsity multiplex -- the Toronto International Film Festivals longtime main press screening venue for years until its move to the downtown entertainment district -- today for a private press screening of Jason Reitmans ""Labor Day"" which is utterly unlike the three previous films that hometown boy Reitman (his family donated the land for the TIFF Lightbox) premiered here ""Thank You For Smoking"" ""Juno"" and ""Up in the Air."" This small-scale gem which Paramount is scheduled to begin rolling out stateside on Christmas Day is part coming-of-age drama and part thriller as well as being swooningly romantic. The protagonist briefly played as an adult by Tobey Maguire (who also narrates) is a 13-year-old in 1987 New Hampshire boy (Caitlin Griffith) whos very protective of his emotionally fragile single mother (Kate Winslet a likely Oscar nominee). Into their unhappy lives comes a convicted murderer (Josh Brolin) who initially takes mother and son captive. But soon both are won over by this seemingly gentle -- if occasionally menacing -- man who cooks mops floors teaches the son softball and even helps babysit the developmentally challenged son of Winslets friend. In the course of a weekend they begin making plans as a family to begin a new life in Canada. But will they be able to get away before the folks in their small town get too suspicious? ""Labor Day"" requires the audience to suspend disbelief to no small degree. Its a credit to the skill of Reitman and his cast that he sold a cynic like me on the utterly romantic concept that Winslet would quickly bloom from Brolins attention to the point where she would risk her sons safety and that the son would let her do this. Winslet and Brolin have wonderful chemistry together and Reitman makes well-worn metaphors like steamy weather and pie baking seem newly invented. Flashbacks to Brolins earlier life that might seem pretentious and/or corny in less sure hands come off well. The film that ""Labor Day"" reminds me most of is Clint Eastwoods underrated masterpiece ""A Perfect World"" which also acutely presented its place and time. Thats high praise indeed.

Daily Edition Login to download Labor Day Telluride Review 416 PM PDT 8/30/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Dale Robinette/Paramount Pictures A nuanced superbly acted love story with a most unusual genesis. TWITTER Jason Reitmans love story stars Kate Winslet as a depressed mother who gives a wounded and perhaps dangerous stranger (Josh Brolin) a ride in her car. The nowadays seldom-visited Hollywood womens picture receives an intelligent and emotionally potent modern treatment in Labor Day. On the basis of Juno Up in the Air Young Adult and now his work here with Kate Winslet Jason Reitman is arguably unsurpassed as a contemporary American director of actresses and his work overall on this simple but delicate story of a lonely single mothers quickly blossoming romance with an escaped convict is skillfully modulated. Told from the point of view of the womans vulnerable son this Christmas Day release from Paramount should be promotable to solid returns on the basis of its offbeat story and heart-tugging appeal. PHOTOS Telluride Film Festival The Films Adapted by Reitman from the fine 2009 novel by Joyce Maynard the story hinges on the elemental appeal of witnessing a formerly vibrant and sensual woman long since withered emotionally and sexually by abandonment and a related trauma being reawakened by a strong and confident albeit deeply flawed man. This process which unfolds rapidly over the course of a long holiday weekend is framed by the insecurities but also admiring perspective of the 13-year-old son who learns a lot from the interloper but is fearful of becoming the odd man out. Adele (Winslet) an unkempt pushing-40 beauty lives with son Henry (Gattlin Griffith) in a similarly untended-to house in smalltown 1987 New England (New Hampshire in the novel Massachusetts here). Reitman with crucial assistance from the low-keyed underscoring of composer Rolfe Kent keeps the suspense at a purposeful low boil throughout the early going as the brutishly handsome and powerfully built Frank (Josh Brolin) politely but firmly approaches the pair in a large convenience store and insists they give him a ride. Bleeding from several places and clearly desperate the goateed Frank is an intriguing but unsettling mix of gentlemanly and threatening meaning that Adele and Henry are tense but not panicky upon learning that he was injured when he jumped out of the second-story hospital window at the prison where he was serving 18 years for murder. Its clear virtually from his entrance that this is the best film role Brolin has had since No Country for Old Men and maybe ever and he makes the most of it. ANALYSIS Telluride Labor Day Plays in Argo Slot But Will It Follow in Oscar Footsteps? The fugitive at first ties Adele up for appearances sake and quickly begins to ingratiate himself by fixing the place up repairing the car teaching the sports-hating Henry about baseball and most of all by cooking. The ultimate man-about-the-house Frank first gives the bound Adele a little charge by slowly hand-feeding her a little something hes thrown together. But this is nothing compared to when he engages his increasingly cooperative hosts in making from scratch the worlds greatest peach pie a process elaborately detailed with an emphasis on the erotic potential of mutually squeezing and mashing bowls full of fruit by hand and massaging and folding the crust. The way Frank looks at talks to and touches Adele has the desired effect and it only takes two nights for the hormonally erupting Henry to overhear his mother being joined by a man in her bedroom for the first time. All this could have been overdone to obvious even gross effect but Reitman keeps a strong grip on all the aspects of the story to prevent it from becoming corny unduly melodramatic or obvious. There are little contrivances such as the nosy neighbors and Franks presumed sexual prowess despite having had an appendectomy two days earlier but the elemental truths easily dominate under the directors watchful eye. Quickly then the story turns from being one of kidnappers and hostages to one of lovers determined to find a way to escape together. The fly in the ointment is Henry who is supposed to start school on the Tuesday after Labor Day and whose initial fear of being traded by his mother to his departed fathers new family might crack the necessary secrecy of their flight. The film emits frequent pangs of emotion and tension which enable it to prevail over threats from the cliches and inevitabilities of the storys format. There is more than one instance when events will cause many viewers hearts to leap as they say into their throats and the wrap-up is quietly satisfying. Managing to look both frumpy and alluring and summoning will and desire from inside a somewhat worn exterior in the manner of her fine recent work as Mildred Pierce (another pie maker) Winslet outstandingly reveals the numerous ways Adele is pulled emotionally by the sudden eventfulness of her life after all these years. Winslet has always been good at portraying the embrace of romance and sex but this is augmented by the gradual revelation in crisp flashbacks using younger actors that brought her to the point of having signed off on love. Tobey Maguire narrates the proceedings as an older Henry looking back only to be briefly seen at the end pursuing his chosen calling. After this and The Great Gatsby however the actor should forgo any further passive observer characters for fear of being forever neutered. Young Griffith is excellent playing Henry as a boy. Production values are modest and everything they need to be.

Factor in the notion that the outsider is an escaped killer however and this all-summer-in-a-day story starts to feel as baked as the convicts peach pies. Underserved female auds will gladly indulge such well-intentioned shenanigans when Paramount opens the film on Dec. 25 since it all builds to a series of emotional payoffs that should elevate this moving weeper into a holiday sleeper.This story first appeared in the September 03 2013 issue of Variety.

Debuting over Labor Day weekend at the Telluride Film Festival Jason Reitmans passionate fifth feature left a significant fraction of its audience in tears as they connected with Kate Winslets Adele a depressed single mother whose pain runs deeper than the film initially lets on. As in Joyce Maynards novel events are told from the perspective of Adeles 14-year-old son Henry or ""Hank"" played by Gattlin Griffith for most of the picture which is set on the last weekend of summer 1985 but narrated in the present by Tobey Maguire. As the voiceover makes clear Hank was too young to understand his mothers needs back then which poses a bit of a problem for Reitmans approach since he ultimately wants to be inside Winslets head. Indeed the director who possesses a good eye for composition and generally sharp instincts with actors seems to be operating from a place of empathy rather than life experience drawing attention to the contrivances that Maynard got away with in her novel. More than once we hear the word ""longing"" to describe Adeles state of mind and theres a sense that shes willed prison escapee Frank (Josh Brolin) into existence. Though he was serving 20 years for murder Frank insists theres more to the story. Time will tell though the film dutifully withholds the tragedies these two characters share in common until the end which makes for a third act even Nicholas Sparks would envy (happily the result most resembles ""The Notebooks"" guiltless-pleasure adaptation though its blindsided-by-love plot owes more to ""The Lucky One""). In the early going Reitman struggles to balance the competing feelings the scenario evokes. He can count on Winslet who has long since mastered the role of affection-starved wife in ""Little Children"" and ""Mildred Pierce"" to communicate Adeles fragility in a matter of a few short scenes but its much harder to accept that a wanted man can be as sensitive as Frank. The film tries to manufacture suspense when Frank first forces his way into their lives though it cant afford to make him too scary lest audiences find him difficult to like. After all everything hinges on Adeles willingness to suppress her instincts and shelter this wanted criminal -- and for auds to accept her actions. Almost immediately Frank proves himself a better father figure to Hank than Adeles ex (Clark Gregg) ever was teaching the boy how to change a tire and sharing other father-son advice that Hank needs at his vulnerable age. The part asks a lot of Griffith who manages to balance the characters conflicting allegiances -- protective of his mother longing for male approval -- without lapsing into precious child-actor mode. In the sweep of Hanks life this is the weekend he goes from being a boy to becoming a man and the movie plants all sorts of foreboding visions to prepare audiences for a worst-case outcome including the warnings of a brooding teenage friend (Brighid Fleming) who felt pushed aside when her own parents found new adult partners. Reitman rightly intuits that erotic tension will take the story farther than a passionate embrace possibly could and so he includes charged moments -- a steady hand on Adeles waist attention paid to a childhood scar and the hyper-sensual act of laying a pie-crust in place. In one especially nice touch Hank is playing a videogame in the next room when he catches the reflection of his mother nuzzling Frank in the screen. ""Labor Day"" brims with such carefully observed details all of them a little too elegant to feel entirely genuine and yet impossible to fault -- apart from the underlying premise of course which is plenty troubling that a misunderstood killer is just the father/lover this incomplete family needs to feel whole again. Still one has to respect Reitman for tackling a project with such a major inherent hurdle and theres no question that this film finds him delving past the ironic veneer of ""Juno"" and ""Young Adult"" into more sentimental (evoking Clint Eastwoods ""The Bridges of Madison County"" and ""A Perfect World"" in particular). The mid-80s period aspects -- beautifully rendered by d.p. Eric Steelberg in sun-dappled shots that seem to be elegantly tracking in out left and right at all times -- are so ripe with nostalgia ""Labor Day"" also calls to mind J.J. Abrams ""Super 8"" only the characters arent junior filmmakers but budding pie-bakers and rather than aliens they have a hostage crisis to contend with. To the extent that Adeles hunger for affection resonates with audiences what emerges is a powerful -- if implausible -- romance.

""Labor Day"" his fifth and most fluid work contains no such ironic refrains. A significant departure for the director ""Labor Day"" is a classical melodramatic tearjerker thats also a sincere coming-of-age story. Reitmans imprint is essentially invisbile perhaps because he stuck so closely to the source material. Described by the director at the movies Telluride premiere as ""the truest adaptation I will ever write"" the result indeed feels as if it hails from a different author in this case Joyce Maynard whose 2009 novel provides the basis for Reitmans script. Because it adheres to a noticeably restrained literary style ""Labor Day"" at times feels almost too muted for its rather bizarre subject matter which finds an escaped convict falling in love with a woman he takes hostage and becoming a surrogate father for her son. But Reitman largely cedes control to a tightly wound cast and lets the somber tone find its way. In its opening scenes ""Labor Day"" establishes a mopey scenario set in a vague New Hampshire town in 1987 when adolescent Henry Wheeler (Gattlin Griffith) lives a solemn existence with his downbeat single mother Adele (Kate Winslet) who has remained in a deep funk ever since her divorce to Henrys father (Clark Gregg). Narrated by the adult Henry (Tobey Maguire) as he looks back on this melancholic time ""Labor Day"" efficiently lays out Henrys commitment to sticking by his fragile mothers side -- a commitment that gets complicated with the sudden arrival of Frank (Josh Brolin) a convicted murderer on the lam bleeding at the waist who corners the couple in a grocery store and forces them to take him home. At first sternly insisting he hide out for a few hours while the cops finish their search Frank turns out to be more complicated than your average fugitive and quickly gains the trust of his captors when he teaches them how to bake a pie in the kitchen. As Franks role in the household continues to evolve the movies tone moves with him. Similar in nature to Jeff Nichols expressionistic coming-of-age saga ""Mud"" which also involved a gentle-hearted escapee ""Labor Day"" uses the crime backdrop to unfurl a far more sophisticated drama about the sense of danger associated with unlocking repressed emotions. Yet even as Frank has symbolic quality developing a gentle relationship with Adele that gradually allows her to come out of her shell its his literal value as the concerned father Henry never had that gradually injects ""Labor Day"" with legitimate pathos particularly because its so obvious that the tidy setup cant last forever. Photographed with heavy shadows and soft hues by Eric Steelberg the movie maintains a noticeably frayed look that lends a much older feel to the proceedings as if the entire plot emanates from Henrys memory banks. However the story remains so traditionally structured that it rarely drifts save for an underwritten romance that Henry experiences with a classmate. In those scenes and a few others Reitman treats the material with an earnestness that occasionally slows things down; the movie largely works whenever it keeps barreling ahead as the entire narrative takes place over the course of the titular holiday weekend. In its closing act ""Labor Day"" arrives at a fulfilling series of confrontations that nicely balance off the tenderness of its introductory scenes. Even so ""Labor Day"" manages to avoid grand gestures to a large degree because of its cast. Both Winslet and Brolin initially come across as noticeably stilted but with time their restraint speaks volumes about the sadness haunting both characters. Winslet delivers a compellingly subtle riff on domestic frustrations by conveying volumes of her hardships with her eyes alone. Brolin has played tough guys before but here he pulls off the tricky maneuver of turning a cliche into a strangely likable mystery man whose own back story -- revealed in a series of oblique flashbacks -- turns his initial air of cruelly on its ear. Griffith a genuine discovery ably conveys a mindset awkwardly stuck between personal desires and mature thought process. At one point Frank insists on tying up Adele and Henry so they dont get implicated if hes eventually captured. ""Its about keeping up appearances"" he says in one of the few cases where ""Labor Day"" acknowledges the multiple layers of storytelling at work. While Henry goes through a process of understanding his mothers grief through the unusual circumstances they find themselves in Reitman also gives into the romantic nature of the material particularly in its swooning conclusion. Theres a certain elegant simplicity to the movies execution that maintains a spirit of familiarity but also keeps the material afloat. Its enough of a success to prove that Reitman like his protagonists in ""Labor Day"" has the ability to move beyond his roots and try something different. Criticwire grade B+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? Paramount releases ""Labor Day"" in late December right in the heat of awards season and its low key nature during the crowded time may hinder its long-term potential. But the combination of strong word of mouth and performances should help the movie perform solidly during its initial run through the end of the year.

""I dont doubt that."" Henry (Gattlin Griffith) knows that one of these people is lying. Despite her reclusive tendencies Adele (Kate Winslet) is just trying to protect her son. Frank (Josh Brolin) respects that; for an escaped convict hes empathetic from the get-go. Their new houseguest needs a place to hide and heal; then again hes not the only one. Unfolding over the eponymous holiday weekend in 1987 Jason Reitmans adaptation of Joyce Maynards ""Labor Day"" is as consistently assured a piece of filmmaking as any weve seen from the filmmaker and very much in keeping with the decreasingly glib nature of his output (""Thank You for Smoking"" ""Juno"" ""Up in the Air"" ""Young Adult"") although such naked sentiment does pile on in the home stretch. Until then the film is as wary of Frank as the Wheelers themselves are. Its easy to assume the worst of a man who readily admits his post-surgery escape from a nearby hospital a man whose murder conviction is all over the news. Once he makes a point of tying up Adele Frank goes about making chili with equal determination matched in fervor by Rolfe Kents initially ominous score. However he makes a point of sharing his meal and its not long before he unties Adele plays catch with Henry and generally attends to household repairs. By the time you can say ""Stockholm syndrome"" all three are making pies together and wondering if this stranger really should leave so soon. Brolin strikes a strong enough balance of conviction and consideration to offset Franks nigh saint-like behavior and Winslet makes it very apparent that he might be just the man that a woman as fragile as Adele needs. She wasnt always this way of course -- the title comes to earn an expectedly tragic dual meaning -- and Reitman takes his time weaving in both of their backstories but we gather subtle details as Frank makes his way around the Wheeler home and whenever Henry goes off to spend time with Dad (Clark Gregg) and his new family. An older Henry (Tobey Maguire) narrates much of the story and Eric Steelbergs cinematography and the immersive amount of period detail combine to make his wistful ode to a Summer That Changed Everything equal parts immediately dangerous and fondly recalled. The only hints of Reitmans earlier sensibilities tend to crop up whenever young Henry ventures back out into the world either to mouth off at his father or to court a snarky-beyond-her-years peer (Brighid Fleming). Amidst it all Griffith holds his own as an often wide-eyed teen coming to grips with both his own adult desires and those of actual grown-ups. As understandable as it will be to compare ""Labor Day"" to similar coming-of-age-with-crooks yarns ""Mud"" and ""A Perfect World"" Reitmans decidedly mature work here on both page and screen also evokes the remove of Todd Field although maybe seeing a suburban Kate Winslet struggling to attain happiness (as in Fields ""Little Children"" or in ""Revolutionary Road"") adds an echo all its own. Only the epilogue feels like a prolonged surrender to more maudlin tendencies an irony that may leave one wanting ""Labor Day"" to end sooner than its own characters do. SCORE 7.7 / 10 ""Labor Day"" will open in limited release on December 25th.
