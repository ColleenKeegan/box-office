"Review Up leaves you on a high - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Up leaves you on a highStory Highlights CNN.coms Tom Charity ""Up"" is another winner from Pixar Film concerns the adventures of an old man and a young boy ... and a talking dog There are some unlikely moments but warmth and richness always come through Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- For a little while it looks like ""Up"" Pixars 10th feature-length film is going to be a downer. In ""Up"" a curmudgeonly senior citizen Carl tries to cope with the enthusiasm of Russell a young boy. Not that theres anything wrong with an animated film tugging at our tear ducts. But you can sense unease rippling through the younger halves of the family audience when about five minutes into a spunky prologue intrepid pre-pubescents Carl and Ellie abruptly morph into newlyweds and then not-so-newlyweds. They gray and stoop before our eyes youthful dreams of exploration traded in for the comforts of home and domestic bliss. Ellie wants a baby but cant have one. Their savings for the holiday of a lifetime are eaten up by this rainy day that domestic disaster until theres no more lifetime left -- not for Ellie anyway. That leaves us with Carl a grumpy homebody voiced by Ed Asner who makes WALL-E look like a chatterbox. And hes one of the main characters. No I didnt hear anyone demanding when the dancing penguins were going to show up but Ill wager someone was thinking it. Watch a preview of ""Up"" >> Such misgivings are ill-founded. As far as razzmatazz goes ""Up"" delivers the goods. Not penguins precisely but more than the airborne house promised by the commercials. Theres a mythical multicolored bird which may or may not be a snipe but which answers to the name of Kevin and exhibits a sweet taste for candy bars. There are zeppelins and old-time explorers and talking dogs -- a whole pack of dogs in fact. Dogs that serve wine and play cards and fly biplanes. Dont Miss Pixars secrets on display in Up Pixar goes 10 for 10 with Up And theres Russell a chubby Boy Scout -- or ""Wilderness Explorer"" -- who turns up on Carls doorstep when he least expects it. After all Carl wants to be free and to get there he launches his house into the sky thanks to thousands of balloons. How was he to know Russell was around? ""Up"" doesnt always fly high. The dogs canine high jinks are closer to ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" than wed expect from Pixar which tends not to play so fast and loose with the laws of nature for the sake of a few cheap laughs. But if the muttering mutts keep the kids happy well and good. The movie is on surer ground teasing out the relationship between Carl and Russell floating well above the Earth. Russell is all wide-eyed innocence and boundless enthusiasm haplessly helpful. Hes the mirror image of the child Carl used to be if only the old man were capable of recognizing it. But instead of looking around him Carl is focused on landing that prize home of his in the prime location he mistakes for his ultimate destination (the lost world of Paradise Falls). The image of Carl valiantly dragging his house through jungle and over mountains will strike a chord with anyone holding down a mortgage. iReport.com Share your review of ""Up"" Written by Bob Petersen and directed by Petersen and Pete Docter -- both Pixar veterans -- ""Up"" mixes allegory with adventure and dumb imaginative exuberance. The balance isnt quite as tight as in Pixars best movies but the lightness is appealing and Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) is an irresistible character. Hes already carrying his own emotional baggage at 8 years old but hes all heart the kind to give kids a good name. Screening in 3-D where possible ""Up"" doesnt go overboard on stereoscopic gimmickry but does exploit depth of field in a string of exhilarating cliffhangers and dogfights. Funny and poignant and full of life ""Up"" easily qualifies as one of the best movies of the year so far. Go with someone you care about. ""Up"" is rated PG and runs 96 minutes.

By David Denby A longing for adventure motivates the new animated feature from Pixar.   Credit Illustration by Bob Staake The recent animated features by the Pixar division of Disney--""The Incredibles"" ""Ratatouille"" ""WALL-E"" and now ""Up""--have amounted to a run of creative success that has few parallels in American popular culture. Yes there was the classic Disney group of animated features released between 1937 and 1942 which included ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" ""Pinocchio"" ""Bambi"" and ""Dumbo."" Children still love them though this aging child doesnt really. The old Disney dispensation went roughly as follows The material was largely based on fairy tales with princes and queens and wicked stepmothers. Animals with long eyelashes engaged in gentle woodland conversation. There was much anthropomorphic charm much sweet melodiousness and running through the sugar a vinegary taste of fear separation punishment. The entire Bruno Bettelheim catalogue of psychological terrors churned below the surface. By now (for me at least) the cloyingness with its malevolent undertones seems too calculated and heavy-spirited. But the recent Pixar films are something else. These movies are fashioned as much for adults as for kids. Set in the modern world they are built around an exhilarating drive for achievement. A family of libertarian superheroes refuses to accept enforced mediocrity (""The Incredibles""). A talented rat wants to practice the art of cooking (""Ratatouille""). A robot saves the aesthetic remnants of a civilization ruined by excess and pollution (""WALL-E""). Some of the characters are isolated; they are all intelligent and strongly motivated. Weve gone from psychological fable to moral fable from fate to something like self-willed even civic passion. ""Up"" which begins in the nineteen-thirties is steeped in the style of that period with its gee-whiz appreciation of exotic adventure and its worship of heroes who have journeyed to strange distant places. A little boy Carl watches newsreels at a theatre and sees an explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) first celebrated then humiliated no one believes the skeleton of a large flightless bird that Muntz has brought back from South America is authentic. When Carl leaves the theatre he imagines the newsreel narrator describing his walk home turning his stepping over a crack in the sidewalk into a vault over a canyon. Its a gracious moment the co-directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson who also wrote the screenplay pay affectionate tribute to daydreaming as a noble and necessary human activity. In dreams begin responsibilities and in dreams begin movies too. A little tomboy Ellie (Elie Docter Petes daughter) bursts into Carls world and in a rapid wordless montage we see their long life together--wedded bliss and also painfully the slow extinction of many hopes including a desire that they too will have great adventures in South America. The marital sequence is one of the most moving animated episodes ever made. Its like looking through a family photo album and knowing that every picture represents a crucial moment of experience. The doll-like figures only increase the pathos--Ellie seen deep within the frame becomes smaller and more and more bent as she sweeps their little house. When she dies the elderly Carl now known as Mr. Frederikson (Ed Asner) is left with nothing but a scrapbook called ""My Big Adventure"" which she kept when she was young. Grouchy and cut off--the filmmakers based his snarl and snap on that of a George Booth old guy--he pretends to be more decrepit than he is. When he gets pushed too far however he revolts attaching thousands of helium balloons to his house which is about to be demolished and heads at last for South America. The house takes off but with an unwanted stowaway--a chubby little round-faced Wilderness Explorer in shorts Russell (Jordan Nagai) a version of the youthful Carl. But this boy doesnt need to dream; he just acts rolling into trouble. The never-achieved adventure begins. Carl will renew his ties with his dead wife and embrace the child they never had. ""Up"" is being distributed in both 2-D and 3-D formats. The third dimension lends the characters palpability. Carl has a square blocky head and a blocky body; the boy has a circular face with a bump for a nose. Neither of them is very big but they look solid weighted. When they reach South America they immediately stumble upon the legendary bird--a gorgeous fantasia of purple and red with an enormous beak and the flexibility of an Olympic gymnast. It turns out that Muntz has been there for years hiding out near a gigantic waterfall trying to catch the creature so that he can restore his reputation. He is aided by a pack of dogs with thick damp jowls and snouts. Except for one or two shots however Docter and Peterson never exploit the obvious 3-D opportunity of fangs snapping in the viewers face. Their use of the technology is relatively chaste; theyre not particularly eager to shock us. They keep their eyes on the story and on the bond that develops between Carl and Russell. For the filmmakers 3-D is a narrative tool which works only if what it is enhancing is strong to begin with. After chases and spills and much scurrying over bare mountain buttes an intricate fight unfolds in the sky. On one side are Carl and Russell held aloft in Carls house; on the other Muntz commanding an enormous dirigible. Russell falls out of the house and winds up clinging to some balloons and as he swings from one place to another you can feel the air around him. Airiness has become a medium to pass through not just dead space. Animation may be the perfect place for 3-D. The movie is packed with lovely jokes some of them funny in inexplicable ways. The dogs have been outfitted with little collars that turn their thoughts into words. When Russell reaches down and flips a switch on one collar a dog starts talking in Japanese or Swahili. He flips the switch again and the animal speaks at squeaky double speed like a cartoon chipmunk. The odd surprises never stop. Muntz at the helm of his dirigible is suddenly transfixed by an odd screeching sound--its Russell hanging on to his balloons and dragging his sneakers across the large windows of the airship. The moment is held for what feels like ten seconds. That annoying rubber-on-glass screech a homely sound in the midst of the wildest fantasy brings us back to the genius of the filmmakers. For all their mad inventions they never quite leave the world behind. ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian"" is what my mother would have called a kakabarly--a large foaming broth into which she emptied the forlorn and highly miscellaneous contents of her icebox. The plot of this family comedy is nominal; its barely a premise. Ben Stiller is back with his beloved stuffed and wax figures and other statues miniatures and artifacts--only not at the American Museum of Natural History this time but in the basement of the Smithsonian complex (which includes a mockup of the National Gallery) where they have been shipped. After dark the figures come to life and the result is pretty much a free-form traffic jam in which everyone fights everyone else. There are a few fine touches in the chaos some of the paintings spill out of their frames; statues of cherubim fly about; and Stiller and Amy Adams (playing a ready-for-anything Amelia Earhart in red curls) jump into the famous Alfred Eisenstaedt photograph of a sailor kissing a nurse on V-J Day and find themselves in a period black-and-white movie. The scene doesnt mean much of anything but its a handsome piece of magic. The great Hank Azaria also deserves praise as a wannabe pharaoh Kahmunrah. Powerful arms emerging from his battle dress Azaria channelling Boris Karloff speaks in a prissy vaguely English accent and with a lisp. Kahmunrah is an exceptionally huffy wannabe. When people insist on calling his war costume a dress he becomes agitated. ""Its a tunic"" Azaria says irritably shaking his fly-whisk sceptre or nekhakha. ""Tunic."" The British director Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"" ""Road to Perdition"" ""Revolutionary Road"") has at times trapped his American characters in visual and moral schemes that hampered their freedom. In ""Away We Go"" working with a loose and colloquial script written by the husband-and-wife novelists Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida he has gone in the opposite direction Mendes now seems to be happily searching for the countrys idiosyncrasies rather than for its archetypes. The structure is open-ended ruminative rumpled almost in the manner of a road movie from the nineteen-seventies. An intelligent young couple Verona (Maya Rudolph) and Burt (John Krasinski) who are about to have their first baby dont quite know who they are or what they want so they travel around visiting friends and relatives many of whom have children. Some of the episodes are ripely satirical others almost heartbreaking. Allison Janney appears as a coarse drunk who taunts her kids; Maggie Gyllenhaal is a pushy New Age mom whose aggressive virtue saps the strength of everyone around her. The movie could be called a search for an ideal of parenthood and also for a place that the two wanderers exhausted but increasingly sure of themselves can call home.

The animation studios latest instant classic -- and its first offered in 3-D in many theaters -- is also the best directed and written film Ive seen thus far in 2009 and quite possibly this century. Yes that is an unqualified endorsement -- and the point where I say Id really prefer you stop reading and go enjoy this movie without a lot of advance information. This is a hugely imaginative and magical fantasy adventure that explores issues such as loss and dreams deferred with such a light and universal touch that it will appeal to an extremely broad audience. Directors Pete Docter (""Monsters Inc."") and Bob Peterson and their co-screenwriter Tom McCarthy brilliantly draw on such cinematic touchstones as ""Its a Wonderful Life"" and ""The Wizard of Oz."" Theyre also inspired by less likely sources such as ""Fitzcarraldo"" ""The Red Balloon"" and Jules Vernes ""The Lost World"" -- not to mention Warner Bros. animated Road Runner and even the logo of its archrival DreamWorks Animation. All of this is deftly wrapped in a deceptively simple story. The main protagonist Carl Fredricksen is first seen as a youngster in a wondrous prologue watching a newsreel in which his hero adventurer Charles Muntz is accused of fabricating a giant bird skeleton he claims to have brought back from South America. Carls faith is unshaken and he finds a kindred spirit in young Ellie -- whom he eventually marries when they grow up. For years they dream of visiting Paradise Falls the site of Muntzs supposed discovery but this never happens for a variety of reasons culminating in Ellies death many decades later. In the film proper Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) is a grumpy 78-year-old who greatly resembles Spencer Tracy toward the end of his career. Carl has shut himself in the home he shared with Ellie and is defying efforts by a real-estate developer to relocate him to a retirement community. When matters come to a head Carl comes up with an ingenious -- and quite magical -- way to stay in the house thousands of balloons he uses to lift it off its foundations and on its way to Paradise Falls. Turns out he has a stowaway Russell (Jordan Nagai) an 8-year-old Junior Wilderness Explorer who Carl finds endlessly annoying -- but who turns out to be an asset on his improbable journey. There are more surprises when they get to South America including the brilliantly colored bird that Muntz claimed to discover whom Russell nicknames Kevin and a pack of dogs with electronic collars that translate their thoughts into words. There are plenty of laughs and action sequences -- including chases and a sword fight -- that will delight the kids punctuated with poignant moments of yearning. I saw ""Up"" projected in 3-D expertly deployed to draw the audience into the films elaborate textures and stunning backgrounds which include mountains over which Carl and Russell drag the house on ropes. But this film is so eye-popping -- the colors and images are so vivid -- that this is the rare 3-D movie you can see in 2-D without feeling the least bit cheated. ""Up"" which packs a dozen good films worth of fun wisdom and artistry into 89 minutes with a minimum of dialogue is as satisfying an experience as Ive had in a movie theater in years. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next BRITAINS GOT A DIVA Read Next BRITAINS GOT A DIVA Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44899 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 26238 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 15793 Braves Brian McCann interest may pave way for Gary Sanchez Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Dug left Russell and Carl Fredricksen in ""Up."" There are so many charming visual touches in Pixars ""Up"" -- like the homey-looking wood-frame house that floats into the sky with the help of a thousand translucent candy-colored balloons -- that frame by frame the movie seems to be daring us not to fall in love with it. The characters may not tug at our heartstrings outright but they do surreptitiously plink away at them The lead character Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) is a square-headed gruff little old man a former balloon seller whos grieving over his wifes death; Russell (Jordan Nagai) is the tubby not-very-bright but well-meaning Boy Scout who at first annoys Carl and then becomes his sole friend. Together Carl and Russell find an adventure -- or perhaps the adventure finds them -- and learn that we cant always know what to expect out of life.""Up"" is unapologetically life-affirming for those who like to have life affirmed. And from a technical standpoint it certainly is beautifully executed. But save for a few inspired canine gags and a handful of very pretty visual details ""Up"" left me cold. Its charms appear to have been applied with surgical precision; by the end I felt expertly sutured but not much else.Im sure thats not the effect the films directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson were going for. Docter co-directed ""Monsters Inc."" and was one of the writers of ""Wall-E""; Peterson is a Pixar vet who was one of the writers of ""Finding Nemo"" and who also worked on the screenplay for ""Ratatouille."" (Hes also the writer of ""Up."") Everyone at Pixar from its writers and directors to its expert army of animators knows exactly what he or she is doing. And in ""Up"" that shows -- too much. The picture opens with the back story of Carl and his wife Ellie They meet as children in the 30s and became fast friends united by their taste for tales of adventure and derring-do. (Little Ellie shows Little Carl a map and points to the spot she dreams of seeing a secluded locale in South America. ""Its like America -- but South"" she explains helpfully an example of the movies kids-say-the-darnedest-things dialogue.) Carl and Ellie grow up fall in love and get married. A wordless montage tells the story of their life together including their inability to have a child. But the two are very close taking great pleasure in each others company despite the usual setbacks of life (and their failure to make it to that South American dream spot aptly named Paradise Falls). Just as Carl decides to go ahead and book the tickets -- by now the two are entering their golden years -- Ellie falls ill and dies. Carl is left alone a grumpy old man trying to hang onto the house he and Ellie lived in and cared for during their years together even as nasty developers try to seize control of it.Carl wont let the suits get the better of him and thats where that floating house held aloft by balloons comes in. The Boy Scout Russell infringes on Carls plans but the two forge an uneasy alliance and their undertaking involves a gawky but resplendent bird of paradise an encounter with one of Carls childhood idols (voiced by Christopher Plummer) and the eager friendship of a talking dog named Dug (Bob Peterson supplies his voice).""Up"" deals with adult ideas in ways that children can accept Its all about dreams deferred the loss of loved ones and the way disappointments sometimes reveal hidden opportunities for happiness. But as great as all of that sounds ""Up"" has the quality of a vacation package masquerading as a journey. Everything in it seems meticulously calibrated to get an effect out of us to return us to a supposedly desirable childlike state of innocence Carl is cantankerous not too cuddly -- at least until the very end when we get the payoff of seeing him transformed into a caring human being. The music by Michael Giacchino has a forced airiness as if in imitation of Nino Rota. And were treated to many many shots of those floating polychrome balloons (even when they become semi-deflated theyre still at least vaguely hopeful-looking) universal symbols of the alleged supremacy of childhood. In the world of ""Up"" being too grown-up is never a good thing The vision of Carl and Ellies marriage which consists largely of their beaming at one another holding hands and having picnics even well into old age looks more like a denture adhesive commercial than a real romantic partnership. You Might Also Like Yet this is what passes for love in ""Up."" It is after all a cartoon -- the filmmakers cant be throwing too much complicated real-life stuff in there aside from comforting platitudes along the lines of ""Its the journey that matters not the destination."" There are certain aspects of ""Up"" that did tickle me the way Dug expresses his doglike thoughts in the most direct way possible (""My name is Dug I have just met you and I love you""); the chiffon translucence and gently shifting colors of the bird of paradises feathers a lovely effect unlike anything Ive ever seen in an animated picture (nicely enhanced by the movies use of 3-D though I suspect its equally effective in 2-D). But like so many of the other Pixar movies ""Up"" is rendered in broad brushstrokes of faux naivete that make me uneasy. ""Up"" like ""Wall-E"" and ""Cars"" before it pretends to scoff at sentimentality when all its really doing is dressing it up in self-awareness. I come away from most of the Pixar films this one included feeling that the filmmakers have taken too many of their cues from Charlie Chaplin and not enough from the drier less-needy Buster Keaton. Brad Bird is the notable exception I see his 2004 ""The Incredibles"" and the 2007 ""Rataouille"" as the real jewels in the Pixar crown. Its universally accepted that theres a Pixar ""sensibility"" -- that is after all part of the mythology the company has created for itself. John Lasseter the chief creative officer of Disney and Pixar has noted in interviews for instance that all of the companys work has been directly or indirectly informed by the work of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. But Birds movies for the company bear a stamp of individuality that I dont see in the others. They have lofty grown-up ideas behind them ""The Incredibles"" deals with the seeming paradox that we feel the greatest love for our fellow human beings because of their flaws not their attributes; ""Ratatouille"" a story with a rat chef as its main character gets at some pretty complicated notions of the meaning art can have in our lives.But Birds great gift is his light touch even in the face of the magnificent technology at his fingertips. (That touch was evident even in his early masterpiece ""The Iron Giant."") ""Up"" is hardly an offensive picture -- at worst its simply innocuous and at best its very very pretty to look at. But just as those lighter-than-air balloons must support the groaning weight of a house ""Up"" works hard to carry its vision of seemingly weightless innocence. This return to childhood comes with many many strings attached. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Up Animation. Starring the voices of Ed Asner Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai. Directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson. (PG. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are scenes in ""Up"" of such beauty economy and poetic wisdom that they belong in any anthology of great movie moments - and this is already apparent today on the morning of the films release. As was the case with ""WALL-E"" ""Up"" shows that for Pixar progress is not just a technological matter. It is moving forward in artistry cultivating realms of wordless splendor that evoke the best of the silent days. Yet ""Up"" also contains boring stretches of mindless freneticism and bland character interaction that test the ability of any adult to stay conscious. ""WALL-E"" was like that too and like ""WALL-E"" ""Up"" has a moving opening and a satisfying finish but too much dull stuff in the middle. The movie more than survives - it even thrives - but that extra padding there as a concession to kid-movie formula should have been tightened up or thrown out altogether. So ""Up"" finds Pixar at a fascinating juncture still testing the deep waters of profound content while keeping a toe in the wading pool of childrens entertainment. From a commercial standpoint this might be an ideal combination and from a critical angle the reflexive approbation that Pixar receives hardly leaves room to consider that it might go beyond past achievements. Then again these people are artists and as artists they have to be able to tell that the first 15 minutes of ""Up"" are at masterpiece level - and that some of the middle scenes involving chases and talking dogs are just marking time.

Photo Disney/Pixar Review Up soars on flights of fancy 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Those first glorious minutes begin some time around 1940. A shy boy Carl meets a rambunctious tomboy who dreams of adventure. Shes bursting with life force and for a few minutes we think that the film might stay in this earlier period. But then in a sequence thats just breathtaking the decades fly by. The boy and girl grow up. They marry. They move into a house. They get middle-aged. We see her tightening his tie and then - in a lovely touch that any silent master would have envied - we see a succession of ties in varying styles one blending into the other indicating the passage of years. By the end of the sequence Carl is alone cranky and arthritic riding down his staircase in an automated chair - an old man with a wonderful love story in his past that no one wants to hear about or would even guess at. Ed Asner is the voice of Carl an ideal choice. Asners grumpiness has never been truly grumpy just the protective stance of a private sensitive person. He lends that quality to Carl. The story kicks in when Carl feeling the world closing in attaches thousands of helium balloons to his house and takes off still inside for South America. A chubby young Boy Scout (voice of Jordan Nagai) comes along for the ride and soon after their arrival they meet a great old explorer (Christopher Plummer) once Carls childhood hero. ""Up"" flags in this midsection becoming stuffed with riffs involving the explorers pack of talking dogs. The movie loses propulsion probably because the character of Carl for most of the movie lacks a particular drive. Still to watch ""Up"" with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout The armchairs where Carl and his wife once sat every night the wifes childhood scrapbook and even the house itself - these all become powerful images. Directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson are not simply animators on the cutting edge but filmmakers working within an artistic tradition that goes way beyond Disney to include names like Charles Chaplin Buster Keaton and Ernst Lubitsch. At their best theyre a lot more than good. The ideal Pixar film would consist of nothing but the very best moments - it would be filled wall-to-wall with genius. I know thats so easy to say. But fine say its impossible for any Pixar film to maintain that exalted level for an entire 96 minutes. Would it be so terrible to release a near-perfect 40- 50- or 60-minute film in combination with other Pixar shorts? Pixar has the attention and goodwill of the world after all. It doesnt have to worry about standard feature length but can take this art form any place it wants. -- AdvisoryWholesome family entertainment.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Carl Fredricksen wants to go on an adventure without leaving home. Perhaps that makes him sound like just another couch potato hankering for a joyride without risk. And Pixars animated charmer ""Up"" starring Ed Asner has plenty of risks. Though for Carl -- and audiences -- there are many more rewards. But the movies clever hook is that the 78-year-old intends to take his home with him to South America a place he and his wife dreamed of visiting. Carried aloft on thousands of party balloons the retired balloon salesman makes his getaway. And so does stowaway Russell one of the dearest animated kid characters to arrive on the big screen. Directed with loving spirit by Pixar veteran Pete Docter ""Up"" takes seriously themes like regret aging grief while delivering a sweet kid-pitched tale in which the youngster is the true hero. The house floating above the clouds is a lot like the fixer-upper newlyweds George and Mary Bailey move into in Frank Capras holiday classic about a guy who hankered for adventure but never got away. Though Carl and wife Ellie didnt take the trips they planned to the film takes time to show that theirs was often a wonderful life. ""Up"" introduces young audiences to some beautifully layered storytelling. It follows Carl from his own childhood -- where he first meets a chatty adventurous girl named Ellie -- to his elder years when he meets a chatty adventurous boy. ""We didnt see that coming"" we thought a few times before the 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer raps on Carls door hoping to gain another badge for his crowded sash by ""assisting"" a senior. Like many uplifting fables ""Up"" has downs. Some are about fairness. Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) was a childhood idol of Carls who goes missing after being accused of faking a find. Then theres the contemporary problem of urban development. Carls beloved house is squeezed by construction. Hes not selling. When the codger goes too far with an overly vigorous act of rebuff hes sentenced to an old folks home. Carls journey is as much and escape as an adventure. Watching the house tear away from its foundation is a buoyant sight. Witnessing Carls discovery of his stowaway makes for deft comedy. Their journey takes them to the mesa-topped mountains of South America. They meet a strange bird. They meet a stranger dog named Dug whose collar translates his thoughts. Docter along with Bob Peterson (writer co-director and the voice of Dug) make the pack of dogs trained to hunt down the rare bird howlingly amusing. Dug is a goofball. (Did you say ""Ball?"") Doberman Alpha (Peterson) and Rottweiler Beta (Delroy Lindo) are obedient to a fault. Still its the humans who own this particular outing. Asners voice will stir baby- boomer memories of Lou Grant. But the curmudgeonly tenor he brings to Carl is timeless. As Russell newcomer Jordan Nagai is full of clueless (or so it seems) heart and curiosity. The writers dont play his innocence merely for laughs. In fact his hopeful nature resonates for us long before Carl gets with the program. Russell is the kid Carl and Ellie never had. In ""Up"" the house isnt the only thing to take flight. Biplanes and a dirigible take us skyward where there are moments of spooky-and-kooky peril that may frighten the wee-est. Theres a well-honed simplicity to the films look. Even though its screening in 3D its not trying to overimpress. The production notes go on thoughtfully about the emotional meaning of squares (Carl) and circles (Russell). The truth is simpler The multidimensional relationship between a youngun and an elder sticks. The lessons of ""Up"" lift us even as they ground our heroes in what really matters. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedy denverpost.com; also on blogs.denverpostcom /madmoviegoer ""Up"" PG for some peril and action. 1 hour 36 minutes.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor May 29 2009 Save for later Saved Disney/Pixar About video ads View Caption of ""Up"" the new animated feature from Pixar opens with an extended sequence lasting no more than ten minutes that is probably the best thing the studio has ever done. Little Carl Fredericksen meets Ellie his rambunctious soul mate and in quick lyrical progression we watch them grow up and marry and live a life together into old age until Ellies death leaves Carl a glum widower.As a piece of poetic compression it ranks with the opening of Orson Welless ""The Magnificent Ambersons.""But Pixar movies have a way of beginning beautifully and then getting lost along the way and ""Up"" for all its charm is no exception. (""Wall-E"" for example was one of the most bifurcated movies ever made - the Earth-bound opening section was transcendent the rest was attenuated). Sustaining a solid story line is just as crucial for animation as for any other kind of movie perhaps more so since its particularly tiring to suspend disbelief if the narrative is wayward. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""Up"" is less visually exuberant than many of the other Pixar films but in this case thats a plus. Its rather thin plot could not have borne the weight of wing-ding stylistics. Along with his codirector Bob Peterson Pete Docter (""Monsters Inc."") frames the action with such pictorial clarity that we are never overwhelmed. This may not be the best of the Pixar movies but its probably the most graceful. (I saw it in 3-D but it can also be viewed with probably not much visual loss in plain old 2-D). Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Up Most of the film is taken up with Carls curmudgeonly decision to literally fly the coop. Hounded by construction crews eager to evict him from his home this balloon salesman attaches balloons to his home and soars away. His mission To touch down in remote Paradise Falls South America the place Ellie always dreamed of visiting.Russell a chubby young stowaway who is proud of his Junior Wilderness Explorer credentials becomes Carls helpmate. Pairing an eager-beaver kid with an old crank is not the freshest of ideas - we await the inevitable bond-a-thon. But as voiced by newcomer Jordan Nagai and Ed Asner these two characters have spunk to burn and that helps scour some of the treacle from the concept.When Carl and Russell encounter in the wilds a legendary renegade explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) and his pack of ravenous dogs the film takes a vaguely Joseph Conradian turn that it cant begin to sustain. A more daring animator - Japans great Hayao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away"") for example - might have brought out the frights and the madness. For all their inventiveness Pixar movies never lose sight of their family entertainment provenance. ""Up"" ventures into the heart of darkness but the most disturbing thing to emerge from it is a prized rainbow-colored 13-foot bird named Kevin. Thats not all bad. Kevins very funny. And hes actually a she. Grade B+ (Rated PG for some peril and action.)

It may be wonderful but it isnt perfect. It feels nervy and adventurous and a little messy the result of formidable creators and genuine wits working on an enormous budget enormously well-spent. As different as it is from its Pixar predecessors ""Ratatouille"" and ""WALLE"" and as different as those two masterworks were from each other ""Up"" shares with those films a few storytelling glitches. Not everything adds up and the action sequences run on a bit as if the filmmakers were nervous about wowing us after all that uncommercial artistry. Yet the expansive emotional landscape of ""Up"" is something new. Disney stockholders surely would prefer the Pixar crew to crank out another ""Cars""  spinning off another few billion in merchandising. (The ""Up"" budget is estimated to be 175 million not including marketing costs.) While I realize the crucial role black ink plays in Pixars continued artistic health and well-being I say More power to these people. They are making the best films coming out of contemporary Hollywood. For most of his life balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen voiced by Ed Asner shared a dream with his wife Ellie to travel to Paradise Falls in South America. (The fictional locale was inspired by the tepui ""tabletop"" mountains of Venezuela among other places where Arthur Conan Doyle set ""The Lost World."") After Ellie dies Carls yearning for adventure dies as well. Yet it rises again phoenix-like and ""Up"" then becomes a chronicle of an unlikely friendship. The narrative conspires to put Carl in a box much like the one his wonderfully detailed head resembles. Threatened with losing his charming two-story house the grump with the shock of snow-white hair engineers a highly photogenic escape He floats his house away thanks to thousands and thousands of balloons in the direction of South America. Eight-year-old Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai blessedly un-slick) is Carls inadvertent stowaway a sweet kid trying to fulfill a merit-badge requirement for aiding a senior citizen. Hes looking for a father figure; Carl resists the role at first though Russells attitude is infectiously almost pathologically optimistic. Those are the bare bones of the script co-written by director Pete Docter in collaboration with co-director Bob Peterson. As with ""The Incredibles"" ""Up"" sets the back-story via newsreel footage One of Carl and Ellies childhood heroes a Hemingway-brand explorer (Christopher Plummer doing the honors with silken menace) is shown as a wrongly disgraced public figure hellbent on proving the existence of a 13-foot bird Muntz claims to have spotted near Paradise Falls. I dont think Docter and company solved this characters place in the story but ""Up"" soars all the same. Some of the comic inventions are inspired Muntz has a pack of dogs equipped with electronic voice boxes which means theyre talking dogs only they speak as if theyve learned English from a poorly translated Berlitz guide. A nice dog Dug becomes a faithful friend and ally to Carl and Russell in their race to save an exotic prehistoric bird Russell names Kevin. The 3-D effects here are subtle and lovely emphasizing depth (and depth of feeling) over gimmickry but this is one 3-D animated feature that holds up terrifically well in plain old 2-D. Like all the best Pixar work ""Up"" will work one way for one age group or sensibility and quite another for a different group. Early on Carls courtship and decades-long marriage to Ellie is depicted in a four-minute montage. It is almost unbearably moving--an emotional and cinematic powerhouse and the way composer Michael Giacchino scores it your heart breaks several times in succession. Yet you dont feel beaten up by the pathos the way some of us felt as kids watching ""Old Yeller."" As Carls house takes flight Giacchinos waltz recalls Victor Youngs theme from ""Around the World in 80 Days."" Strike that It doesnt recall it; it equals it. Docters film owes as much to the visual imagination of animation pioneer Hayao Miyazaki who did ""Howls Moving Castle"" as it does to any previous Pixar film. Call this one ""Carls Floating Victorian."" And call it marvelous. MPAA rating PG (for some peril and action)Running time 134. Opens Friday.Starring the voices of Ed Asner (Carl Fredricksen); Christopher Plummer (Charles Muntz); Jordan Nagai (Russell); Bob Peterson (Dug). Directed by Pete Docter; co-directed by Bob Peterson; written by Peterson and Docter; produced by Jonas Rivera. A Walt Disney Pictures release. Posted at 025006 PM in Reviews Comments Does this paper have a proofreader or copy editor anymore? The ""front page"" of the Web site has the following ungrammatical phrase ""Its a childrens movie with some very emotional scenes that may be hard to kids to grasp."" People are terrible readers terrible writers and have great difficulty comprehending one another these days; it just doesnt help when a newspaper cant even communicate clearly Did you mean ""that may be hard for kids to grasp""? or something else? Join me in complaining Mr. Phillips so you dont look like an idiot to your readers. I assume this was not your error. Posted by Gammar | June 14 2009 at 1141 PM I think everyone should stop what theyre doing and run out and see this right now. Posted by Cheryl | June 03 2009 at 1159 AM Nice to look at but thoroughly disappointing unlikeable dog characters amp; Kevin the female bird. I expected much more from the story. The large middle chunk of the film is middling amp; boring. Posted by a.c. | June 01 2009 at 0915 PM Took my 7 and 8 yr old they thought it was great and so did I. Posted by Pete | June 01 2009 at 0511 PM I just came from an early screening. I would say that Up has some more dark undertones than earlier Pixar movies and even though its Pixar and its animation I would be hesitant to bring really young kids to the movie. Dont get me wrong but this isnt A Bugs Life or Toy Story. Its a good movie but not Pixars best work in terms of a story line. Posted by Ian M Gumby | May 28 2009 at 0930 PM Pixar is located in Emeryville not Hollywood. I was reading in sfgate.com that there are local references to Oakland(} where the director and some writers live. As an East Bay spawn myself I have long said ""If it aint Pixar....its crap "".

In a cross-his-heart ceremony Carl vowed solemnly to his high-spirited love that he would one day take her to Paradise Falls the stunning Peruvian waterfall where Muntz was last seen seven decades ago. But in a silent montage that rivals WALLEs lyrical first act we watch Ellie and Carls cookie jar airfare savings get smashed into time and again to cover immediate disasters until the couple are nearly too old and frail to make the trip and ultimately the two are whittled down to one. Its ten minutes in to the most-anticipated cartoon of the year and the adults are crying. The kids arent--theyre pumped for adventure--and what I love so deeply about Pixar is that thats okay. The studio has no rivals in creating films that are seamlessly all-ages. Shrek and his kin feel cobbled together from two slapstick kid jokes to every stealth pop culture gag (a lowest common denominator formula that leaves kids and their parents restless and questioning the others taste). Pixar doesnt grovel; it elevates. All filmmakers protesting that they only spoon feed kids the crap they crave I present to you Pixars two recent stars a silent robot and a geriatric widower. Both heaps more funny and affecting than any talking penguin/parrot/panda that moves with dignity through a world that allows them that dignity. Carl is resigned to spending his last few years padding around his house lost in memory. But a small credible disaster changes the game and with his back to the wall Carl looks up stringing his chimney with a balloon cloud eight times bigger than his house and floating off to South America. He hasnt quite thought his plan through--thunderstorms come as a shock--but to his luck (and annoyance) hes joined by an 8-year-old stowaway named Russell (Jordan Nagai) with a chest full of Wilderness Explorer badges and a GPS system that we meet just in time to watch it haplessly plunge out the window. Russell has enough cheerful energy for the two of them but hes never cloying. And like the kids in the audience hes too callow to understand Carls quest--for all its own empathy this is a film too honest for forced hugs. Once theyve touched down the second wave of the adventure begins as Russell and Carl are joined by Kevin the giant bird and Doug the dog who communicates via a high-tech collar that translates his thoughts into any of the worlds major languages. Its a goofy conceit but Doug remains wonderfully dog-ish. He doesnt wisecrack he pants ""I have just met you and I love you"" Dougs canine cohorts are less trusting as theyre on a mission sent by a master who hitched them all to the translators--and also were delighted to learn trained them to open champagne and dutifully try to round up Russell and Carl for questioning (or as they call them ""The small mailman and the one who smells of prunes""). Were dreading the moment when all this whimsy and beauty forces itself to crescendo into a resolution but the action sequences turn out to be very well done. When the time comes for heroism the gang acts like heroes but they also act like themselves standing their ground exactly as a septuagenarian and a chubby schoolboy would. For a cartoon there is no cartoonish violence. There is suspense and even a dash of genuine fright but what hurts and whats wonderful about Up is that nobody gets hurt without it hurting us to witness it--kids arent going to leave bopping each other with imaginary canes. When the credits rolled Id tallied three bouts of tears and dozens more bursts of laughter with a few gorgeous moments seared in my memory like the image of Carl alone pulling his floating house before a scorching sunset. Hes a grump but hes a childlike grump. Perhaps because he wound up with his boyhood love Carl takes the rites of children and their heart-crossed promises as seriously as any kid in the audience. And someday theyll get older and wiser and realize that alongside all the parts that sent them into giggles Carls story has its own serious beauty which makes Up a classic that matures along with its audience. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> A grumpy old coot a chubby kid and a house hoisted by helium balloons -- if youre thinking that Up sounds like a shortcut to sugar shock snap out of it. Pandering to ninnies is not on the agenda for this latest landmark in Pixar animation. With Pete Docter and Bob Peterson sharing the directing and writing Up is a breathtaking ride into the realm of pure imagination. Up shames the pap that now passes for family entertainment (yes Night at the Museum 2 Im talking to you). More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> You can feel balls-out creativity whooshing through every frame. Darkness and its cousin loss also intrude as they do in Pixars best films (The Incredibles WALL-E Finding Nemo). Up sees the world as real full of life and pain. Some theaters are showing Up in 3-D which dims the color a bit but the dimensions that count are in the movies mind and heart. The opening sequence is touched by genius. A young Depression-era boy named Carl goes to the movies and watches a newsreel about Charles Muntz (a complex portrait in voice by the great Christopher Plummer) an explorer who takes off for South America in a dirigible to track a giant bird at Paradise Falls. Quiet Carl wants to explore as well. He meets an exciting motor-mouthed girl Ellie who shares his feelings. They grow up marry and grow old without fulfilling their dreams of children or adventure. This near-silent prelude is Pixar perfection. Up achieves literal liftoff when the widowed Carl (eloquently growled by Ed Asner) takes the balloons he used to sell pre-retirement ties them to his house and takes off for Paradise Falls. He doesnt know he has a stowaway eight-year-old Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai). And he doesnt know the perils of his journey will include Muntzs pack of attack dogs with electronic collars that enable them to talk. The movie is wonderfully funny and touching (props to the gawky hero of a bird Russell names Kevin) but whats really exhilarating are the risks it takes all set to Michael Giacchinos ardent award-caliber score. Up may be the first animated kiddie crowd-pleaser to feature dentures and an hommage to Werner Herzogs Fitzcarraldo as old man and boy drag a house and the burden of dreams through the jungle.

"Pixars Up reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Pixars Up reviewed. Pixars Up reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 28 2009 641 PM Time To Get High Pixars Up is awesome. By Dana Stevens Up About midway through Up the new animated film from Pixar I stepped outside the movie for a moment and realized just how bizarre it is An old man tied via a garden hose to a house held aloft by helium balloons is leading a garrulous Asian-American Boy Scout through a surreal South American landscape pursued by a dog with a talking collar and an endangered female bird named Kevin. Looked at from some remove the movie sounds like a deliberately zany kids cartoon a digitally rendered version of Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World. But thats the thing; the viewer of Up doesnt experience it from any such remove. Up is as psychologically realist as any adult drama starring flesh-and-bone actors. The question of whether and how this motley cohort will reach their destination has as much dramatic value as the question of who will get on the plane at the end of Casablanca. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In a prologue set in the 1930s two children Carl and Ellie form a club based on their shared love for travel and adventure. Both kids worship an Indiana Jones-style scientist named Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer) whose globe-trotting adventures are seen in a priceless mock newsreel. Carl and Ellie grow up to marry and have a long happy life together--all of which we see compressed into a dialogue-free montage thats less than five minutes long and elicits tears as efficiently as if a cloud of mace had been released into the theater. Advertisement Ellie dies without ever having made it to Paradise Falls the South American waterfall that was the couples dream destination. Carl now in his 70s and voiced by Edward Asner retreats into depression isolating himself in the pastel-painted house he and Ellie once shared while a modern city grows up around him. On the day that hes scheduled to be evicted and sent to an old folks home Carl ties thousands of helium balloons to his chimney and takes to the skies house and all. Once youve accepted the idea of a helium-powered wooden house as navigable aircraft its easy to believe that Carl finds an unwelcome stowaway on his porch 8-year-old wilderness scout Russell (Jordan Nagai) and that the two manage to steer the vessel to a spot in view of Paradise Falls. This spectacular waterfall (seemingly modeled on Venezuelas Angel Falls) drops hundreds of feet down sheer cliffs in a bare landscape reminiscent of the terrain through which Wile E. Coyote chases the Road Runner. In the movies Beckett-ian middle section the gloomy Carl and the irrepressibly chatty Russell make their slow and painful way through this landscape toward the falls. As they proceed the balloons slowly lose altitude and the house starts to weigh on Carl with all the heaviness of grief. Ill leave you to find out what happens to the travelers after that. But its worth noting that the talking dog collar which translates what passes for canine thought into human language is the source of the movies best gags none of which would work on paper. Theyre too dependent on character and context not to mention the vocal stylings of Bob Peterson who provides the voice for Dug the dimwitted dog--and who also co-wrote and co-directed the movie with Monsters Inc.s Pete Docter. Whats marvelous about Up is how confidently it assumes the audience will smartly follow wherever it wants to take us. A climactic showdown aboard a giant blimp an old man paging through the scrapbook of his dead wife--both moments are equally worthy of our attention and of the filmmakers meticulous care. Advertisement The tone of Up is tender but never mawkish thanks in no small part to a delicate score by Michael Giacchino. Giacchino is fast becoming my favorite living film composer. He did the soundtracks for The Incredibles Ratatouille and the new Star Trek all of which combine a gift for pastiche with an unironic emotional directness. Up is Pixars most ambitious attempt yet to take animation to higher (and deeper) places than its been before and Giacchinos sprightly music keeps the whole thing impossibly aloft.

On a windy wharf on the beach opposite the swank Carlton hotel here a playhouse-size pastel domicile complete with weather vane was being tugged almost but not quite aloft by a huge balloon covered in hundreds of smaller multicolored ones.

The PG-rated film featuring the voice of Ed Asner as a crotchety old man named Carl who sets out to sail his house to South America is the first animated movie to open the festival as well as the first 3-D movie and the first Disney movie. ""The thing Im looking forward to the most is seeing that great image of all these people tonight in their tuxedos and gowns with 3-D glasses"" said Pixar Chief Creative Officer and ""Up"" executive producer John Lasseter at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. Indeed there is something refreshingly wholesome about a bunch of balloons being the focus of the paparazzi swarming the beach at an event -- the classic Cannes photo stunt -- made famous by the equally buoyant gifts of Brigitte Bardot and Pia Zadora. (The biggest ""Up"" star on the Croisette the citys glittery main drag is the graceful still-suave Charles Aznavour who voices Asners character in the French version.) ""Up"" possesses all the aesthetic and philosophical values that audiences have come to expect from Pixar rich intricately detailed visuals un-snarky humor and a genuinely affecting story. At a press screening at the stifling crowded Auditorium Debussy earlier Wedneday even hardhearted journos could be heard sniffling during ""Ups"" more wistful moments. They could also be heard gasping with delight. (""Walt Disney always said For every laugh there should be a tear "" Lasseter noted.) The quiet un-starry nature of ""Up"" might make it the perfect fit for this years edition of the festival. The films mix of technical ambition and tonal modesty seems right at a time when economic woes have forced the professional showmen who come here to promote and pick up films to rein in the excess of their ballyhoo. The storied Vanity Fair party has been canceled studios have sent fewer staffers (or none at all) and some of those yachts bobbing prettily in Cannes charming harbor are also bobbing emptily. ""It does feel a little quieter to me"" said Disney publicist Dave Wong. ""The lobby of the Carlton is usually packed and you cant even walk down the Croisette. But it may pick up."" And as the first animated festival opener ""Up"" harmonizes nicely with a program that is particularly eclectic and pluralistic. At the news conference one German television reporter even tried to suggest that the film which features an elderly man and a young boy doing battle with a villain and a pack of highly trained canines was a metaphor for ""a new America coming out replacing the old one which goes about aggressively violently unleashing the dogs of war."" To which ""Ups"" gangly string bean of a director Pete Docter cheerfully replied ""We started the film five years ago but if you see that in the movie help yourself"" Political metaphors aside it does seem significant that only two American films were selected for the coveted competition Quentin Tarantinos World War II action adventure ""Inglourious Basterds"" and Ang Lees period comedy ""Taking Woodstock."" (Although the American film ""Up"" is opening the festival it is not in competition.) The rest of the films both in and out of competition reach across a wide scope of countries styles and genres. Some of the most highly anticipated screenings are for Pedro AlmodA3vars ""Broken Embraces"" Lars von Triers ""Antichrist"" and Terry Gilliams ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" (which features Heath Ledger in his final role). Interest is also high for films by directors who may not be household names but who boast devoted followings including Michael Haneke (""The White Ribbon"") Bahman Ghobadi (""No One Knows About Persian Cats"") and Andrea Arnold (""Fish Tank""). For even more generic obscurity the festival is also screening Sam Raimis horror flick ""Drag Me to Hell"" which opens May 29. Cannes isnt only a festival its also a film market and there are distributors here with their wallets open if not bursting. But with finances straitened amid a worldwide economic crisis there will likely be no feeding frenzy just as there might be fewer photogenic opportunists promenading provocatively up and down the Croisette the odd group of young women wearing nothing more than black Spandex a swatch of gold lamA(c) and a really good suntan notwithstanding. Meanwhile back at the Carlton beach Aznavour is gently leading ""Ups"" Jordan Nagai who voices an 8-year-old boy who accompanies the old man on his trip back to dry land. To the disappointment of ""Ups"" promoters it looks as though the house is staying put for now. No matter.

It won rave reviews during its debut at the Cannes Film Festival. ""Up"" Movie Review -- ""Up"" the latest lovely fantasy from the artists at Disneys Pixar animation its a truly fantastic adventure -- a lighter-than-air daydream about a cranky widower (the voice of Ed Asner) a chubby boy and their amazing journey. No matter what else is released this year at least one Best Animated Feature nomination -- if not the winner -- is already picked out. Up (PG) Disney (94 min.) Directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson. With the voices of Ed Asner Jordan Nagai. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating THREE AND A HALF STARS Ratings note The film contains scenes of animals and children in peril. ""Up"" has a delightful prologue set in the 30s and the sort of slam-bang chase scene at the end that used to mark the ""Wallace and Gromit"" stories. Its a delight pretty much throughout. Whats true genius though is a sequence about five minutes in where Carl and Ellie -- the kids at the very beginning of the film -- grow up get married and grow old. Its pure visual filmmaking without a word spoken -- just the haunting music of Michael Giacchino -- and itll be talked about the way the first half-hour of ""WALL-E"" was discussed. The rest of this movie isnt quite at that perfect peak but its still great fun and inventive animation. Unlike most cartoons which go for cutesy caricature this one is practically a geometry lesson; ornery old man Carl is all squares and rectangles pesky pudgy Russell a rolling mass of circles and ovals. The story -- from co-director Bob Peterson who also wrote ""Finding Nemo"" -- has the elegant simplicity of a childrens picture book too. Forced to leave his house a lonely retiree decides simply to take it with him. So after tying thousands of balloons to it he flies off to Peru -- not realizing unfortunately that he has an 8-year-old stowaway on board intent on earning his Wilderness Explorer badge. Ed Asner provides Carls voice and young Jordan Nagai does Russells and theyre both effortlessly believable. Delightfully different too. I mean just look at them. A grumpy old man and a chunky Asian-American kid -- these are not a big studios typical heroes. And heroes they become once they land in South America and find themselves facing an unexpected challenge from the past. Its here perhaps that the movie goes a little too far. A film that features a Victorian house sailing through the sky is magical enough -- adding an army of talking dogs is pushing things (never mind having those dogs then fly around in ancient biplanes). But there are plenty of bright silly things here like a giant squawking bird that Russell soon takes well under his wing. And at least when the dogs do speak (courtesy of some sci-fi collars that translate their barks) they say all the stupid things you know your pet would (mostly excited chatter about squirrels treats and tennis balls). None of these later scenes quite matches the grown-up artistry of that early wordless sequence. But by the time the film reaches its final breakneck chases theres nothing to do but surrender happily to the excitement -- and cheer our unlikely heroes on. And I dont just mean that cranky senior citizen and his misfit friend. I mean the heroic band of animators who have spent the last 15 years or so -- with ""Toy Story"" with ""The Incredibles"" with ""WALL-E"" -- giving us back the giddy guiltless joy of cartoons.

(Disney/Pixar) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday May 28 2009 1103 AM Title Up Animated adventure about an unlikely pair of explorers. Directors Pete Docter Bob Peterson (136). PG peril action scares. At area theaters. Has there ever been a company with Pixars unqualified success rate? Amazingly enough their secret seems to be as straightforward as the projects are complex they simply refuse to underestimate their audience. Where most animated films pander to children and wink at adults the Pixar geniuses assume were all equals and equally deserving of the best they can create. While their latest achievement cant quite one-up ""WALL-E"" it offers soaring highs that are bound to enchant viewers of any age. From title to trailers ""Up"" appears to be light as air. But theres an unapologetically dark streak to this story which begins when two young adventurers meet in the 1930s. In an exquisite montage we watch Carl and Ellie grow up fall in love and settle down. But their fairytale romance includes some very real heartbreaks and unfulfilled dreams. Saddest of all is the day Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) is left a widower. To honor his beloved he decides to visit South America as theyd always planned. Carl travels by air and like the rest of the beautifully-rendered 3-D images his takeoff is worth your ticket price alone. Affixing thousands of multihued balloons to his house he lifts off and enters the sky only to discover a stowaway Russell (Jordan Nagai) a neglected 8-year-old who could use a father figure. Being a cranky loner Carl has no use for company. Russell however isnt the kind of kid to take a hint. Once in South America theyre beset by a pack of furious dogs hunting a rare ostrich-like bird. The dogs belong to Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) an explorer obsessively determined to capture the bird. As soon as you see this adorable creature youll understand why Russell refuses to let that happen. Filmmakers Pete Docter and Bob Peterson find a near-ideal balance between sweetness and sentimentality (though parents should definitely take that PG rating to heart). Every detail from the hairs on Carls chin to the lovely lingering score has been tended to by a Pixar perfectionist. If theres any oversight its that girls will find themselves curiously underrepresented in yet another of Pixars grand adventures. The company does such an extraordinary job making movies for everyone. Shouldnt they be about everyone too?

Troy Melhus Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Another year another Pixar triumph. When is the infallible animation house going to release a lazy pandering cheeseburger so we have something novel to say about it? The sublime ""Up"" suggests that the studios reputation for smart fun and creative integrity is nowhere near winding down. From the title onward ""Up"" is a stratospheric success. Its guaranteed to lift your spirits and not with a pushy DreamWorks-style gag reel of celebrity voices and committee-processed one-liners. ""Up"" takes the high road. Its the kind of work made by people who love original risky ideas and get excited about supporting them. Its whimsical fun breezy and lighthearted bouncing on buoyant charm but soulful too. Walt Disney decreed that in his animated features ""for every laugh there must be a tear"" and so it is here. Real-life emotions make the humor ring true. Its deftly poised between levity and gravity. ""Up"" is the studios first film to be set entirely in the human world and its hero is 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen. (With ""Up"" coming on the heels of Clint Eastwoods smash ""Gran Torino"" we could be entering a golden age of grouchy grandpas.) We meet Carl as a kid in the 1930s imagining a life of daring exploits. He idolizes Charles Muntz a high-flying explorer who vanished collecting rare animals from around the globe. Carls rambunctious young neighbor Ellie shares his yen for adventure and a lovely dialogue-free montage follows their sweet relationship from contented marriage to old age. They dream of traveling to South Americas mile-high Paradise Falls. But as lifes nuisances nibble at their vacation fund the trip goes on hold. Carl dispenses happiness as a balloon vendor at the city zoo and he has a warm home life but the grand adventure he hoped for never materializes. As he ages Carl becomes literally a square. At 78 his body resembles a stack of cardboard boxes. His head is a cube his glasses rectangular. We know this old guy like a family member and care for him deeply. Courtesy Disney / Pixar ""Up"" Widowed and retired Carl retreats into his gingerbread Victorian house. But the world keeps pushing in on him. Hes the last holdout against a skyscraper development that is rising all around the perimeter of his lot. Realizing that he never fulfilled Ellies getaway wish he ties his surplus helium balloons to his house and floats away toward Paradise Falls. To his shock he discovers a stowaway. Eight-year-old Russell is a cheerful well-meaning scout who has been hanging around Carls house in hopes of earning his Assisting the Elderly merit badge. The chubby balloon-shaped boys endless chatter is annoying to Carl but endearing to the viewers. Drifting through lightning storms and near-collisions they land in the high plateaus of Venezuela the strange landscapes that inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in writing ""The Lost World"" and find artifacts from the lost explorer Muntz. They discover a species of goony bird thats half ostrich and half toucan a pack of mutts fitted with collars that turn dog thoughts into speech (""I have just met you and I love you"") and a menacing adversary. The finale is a whiz-bang aerial battle between a zeppelin and canine-piloted biplanes -- a literal dogfight. Amid the laughs and thrills we never lose track of the connection growing between Russell and Carl and the old mans journey from grump to Gramps. The vocal actors -- gravelly Ed Asner and the endearingly natural Jordan Nagai -- have a great rapport. ""Up"" Pixars first venture into 3D employs the process in a way thats apt and awe-inspiring. ""Up"" is a movie made in 3D not a 3D movie. Rather than stabbing you in the eye with spears writer/director Pete Docter and his colleagues use 3D as a window into the characters world. Half of the film is set on a high plateau with sheer cliffs all around and the dropoffs are vertigo-inducing. The character design is vintage Disney caricature while the textures of objects onscreen have a stunning physicality. You can feel the weave of the textiles the smooth heft of stones. It adds depth without calling undue attention to itself. Thats the Pixar way. While the technique is dazzling its the emotions ideas and characters that count. ""Up"" tickles you silly but leaves you with worthwhile ideas to ponder. What is the adventure of a lifetime anyway? A daredevil series of cliffhangers in a wild exotic land? Or could it be committing yourself heart and soul to another person forever? Theres more than one way to take an amazing journey even if it takes you 78 years to figure that out.

"Up - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW UpA tale of a senior citizen and a boy on a helium-powered adventure soars on Pixars imaginative concept and remarkable animation.May 29 2009|Kenneth Turan FILM CRITIC As success follows success for animation powerhouse Pixar the pressure to maintain the streak must be phenomenal. Will the next film be the one that stumbles the one that breaks stride? No one need worry however about ""Up"" Pixars 10th and latest effort. Its not only good its one of Pixars best. Some films are an obligation to write about ""Up"" is the purest pleasure.Though films such as ""Toy Story"" ""A Bugs Life"" ""Toy Story 2"" ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Wall-E"" are tough to compete with director and co-screenwriter Pete Docter a Pixar veteran who had a credit on all those films was able to push ""Up"" into the pantheon. He did it by letting his imagination fly away. Working with co-director and co-writer Bob Peterson Docter came up the idea of cranky 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) floating off to parts unknown when his house gets hoisted into the air by exactly 20622 helium balloons. Try pitching that idea to your agent.But what makes ""Up"" stand out is not just that core concept but what the Pixar team has been able to do with it. Rarely has any film let alone an animated one powered by the logic of dream and fantasy been able to move so successfully -- and so effortlessly -- through so many different kinds of cinematic territory.Because ""Up"" is a Pixar film its a given that its going to be clever and playful. But ""Up"" also has the high excitement of an adventure story and enough genuine menace to make it only the second Pixar product (after ""The Incredibles"") to be rated PG instead of G.Theres also the wordless visual magic of that floating balloon-powered house as well as a truly wacky sense of humor involving a pack of dogs equipped with high-tech collars that turn their classically canine thoughts into words.As if all this wasnt enough ""Up"" also generates genuine emotion and it does so by dealing unapologetically with one of Hollywoods last and most persistent taboos old people. Instead of a Clint Eastwood-type senior citizen who is fitter than people half his age ""Up"" gives us a man who uses a walker and cant handle stairs but still manages to be heroic when it counts.And ""Ups"" multi-minute montage of the long married life of Carl and his wife Ellie is a small gem that will stay with you for a lifetime.Before we get to the old man however we meet the boy he outgrew. Young Carl is introduced in a movie theater watching a newsreel of his hero the great South American explorer and adventurer Charles F. Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer) a dashing sort given to piloting his own dirigible to such exotic locales as South Americas Paradise Falls.On the way home Carl runs into a feisty irresistible gap-toothed girl named Ellie (a wonderful Elie Docter the directors daughter) who is as enamored of Muntz and his ""Adventure is out there"" motto as Carl is. Carl is happy to bask in her energy not only for the day but for a lifetime.The bulk of ""Up"" however takes place after Ellies death with Carl as a cantankerous widower with bushy eyebrows over square black glasses and a squarer jaw.He is so alone now not only emotionally but also physically -- the little house he and Ellie shared is totally surrounded by an enormous modern high-rise development.When circumstances seem to be forcing Carl out of the house he loves he takes the kind of drastic action open to a former balloon salesman he pumps up the helium and off he goes heading for Paradise Falls he hopes and the kind of adventure Ellie always dreamed of but never had.Theres just one problem though He has a stowaway. That would be an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) a roly-poly package of chubby determination who is nothing if not resolved to get the ""assistance to the elderly"" merit badge he is in desperate need of.Pesky persistent and goofy Russell is no surprise the perfect foil for Carls crankiness. Together they head off on a series of adventures neither of them could have predicted.After all who predicts talking animals a giant multicolored bird who loves chocolate and a dog named Dug (amusingly voiced by co-director Peterson) who just wants to belong?Though ""Up"" does so many things so well the quality that stays with you longest is its fearlessness in the face of emotion. This is a film that is heartfelt enough to restore your faith in whatever needs restoration. --UpMPAA rating PG for some peril and actionRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Pixars Brave doesnt hit the bulls-eyeJune 22 2012Toy Story 3 Inception generate huge foreign grossesJuly 26 2010Pixar Angling to Take Bite Out of Disneys Share in Deal...June 25 2003THQ to Make Video Games for Pixar FilmsMay 8 2002Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/29/entertainment/et-up29,200,up18,up,latimes

Kate Taylor From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 28 2009 255PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Up Directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson Written by Bob Peterson Classification NA The new Disney-Pixar animated feature Up is the kind of movie that leaves you asking ""How do people come up this stuff?"" - not in derision but in awe. Up adheres faithfully to the three-act structure prescribed emotional arc and predictable sentiments that make almost every movie feel formulaic these days. Yet the outrageously inventive fable that it tells lifts it above the mundane and sends it floating off to the heights of charm as if carried by a helium balloon. Or a bushel of helium balloons in this instance for that is Up s chief image of a house borne aloft by a huge bunch of multicoloured balloons a magical icon that belongs in a storybook if not perhaps a physics text. The reason for the balloons is that old man Carl (a recalcitrant grouch warmly voiced by Ed Asner) is flying his house down to Venezuela to fulfill his late wifes long-held fantasy of living on the edge of the renowned Paradise Falls. (The falls are fictional; the setting once he gets there is part rain forest part towering cliffs and weird rock formations.) As children he and his future bride once idolized the discredited explorer Charles Muntz who set off for the jungles at the foot of the falls vowing never to return until he had secured a live specimen of an exotic bird that no one believed existed. So Carl arrives in Venezuela with a boy scout named Russell as an unwilling stowaway trapped on the porch when the house lifts up. They land a good distance from the falls and Carl is determined to walk the rest of the way with the house tethered to their bodies floating above. Russell however befriends some strange bird he names Kevin. A talking dog named Dug joins their band and soon the inadvertent explorers discover they have a choice to get to the falls or to protect Kevin from a whole pack of viciously rampaging dogs who must capture the bird for their master. This is good. We dont just have impediments to the quest we have two contradictory quests. And the lesson for Carl - that his regrets are overblown and his second chance does not lie in the direction he thinks - is subtle enough that it dawns on the audience at the same time as the character. Plus as the figure of the long-lost explorer Muntz richly voiced by Christopher Plummer emerges from the rocks theres a nasty narrative twist that Carl himself sums up rather nicely Imagine getting to meet your childhood hero and then finding out he wants to kill you. Technically of course the film is highly impressive in that rather over-wrought manner beloved of contemporary animation studios. Like a connoisseur of vinyl I prefer the flatness of the pre-digital cartoons and find much of the contemporary stuff just creepy in its hyper-realism. Up is not merely digital but digital 3-D Put on those funny glasses and the charming wee characters look like dolls posed in their cute little dollhouse. Its a cloying effect but it evaporates as the characters personalities grow on you. The fang-bearing dogs and vertiginous canyons on the other hand jump off the screen in a pugilistic manner guaranteed to terrify younger members of the audience. Caveat emptor in that regard. Disney has historically peopled cartoons aimed at children with violent gruesomely animated villains. For all its delicious whimsy Up is no exception.

By Ty Burr Globe Staff / May 29 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + I think we can safely say at this point that Pixar has entered its Baroque period. When ""Toy Story"" came out in 1995 who would have guessed that within 15 years the company would be creating the richest most resonant entertainments in Hollywood - on such subjects as culinary rats and a robot sentinel left in charge of a junkyard Earth? There is nothing it seems John Lasseters house of soulful computer artisans cant do.Which is why ""Up"" comes as a shock. Its ambitions are emotional and visual rather than thematic but on the most basic level the new film is pure vaudeville a loopy flyaway fantasy thats hysterically funny if only to keep the darkness at bay. Its a wonderful movie - fit for the whole family and for once I mean that as praise - but it doesnt seem designed for a higher purpose the way say ""WALL-E"" did. ""Up"" is a breather a respite a romp but one with infinite shades of feeling.Most bizarrely - at least to those who make their business selling plastic superheroes to our children - the hero is an old man. A very old man. Carl Fredericksen (voiced by Ed Asner his Lou Grant snarl undimmed by time) is a crotchety widower whose cube-shaped face sits atop his wizened frame like a bobblehead. In an elegant visual touch he has been given the white hair and thick horn-rimmed glasses of the late-era Cary Grant. Carl doesnt like much in this modern world and in the opening moments of ""Up"" we learn why.Those first scenes function as both a prologue and a life story compacted into 10 breathtakingly beautiful minutes - its a Pixar short really and possibly the best the company has ever done. We see the young Carl shy and entranced by 1930s newsreels of explorer Carl Muntz (Christopher Plummer) fall in with a delightful gap-toothed tomboy named Ellie. Time gracefully elides and they grow marry keep house a world unto themselves. Then Ellie passes and Carl is left with the dreams of the South American adventure they never took and a ramshackle home surrounded by urban towers. Theres no place to go but well you know.In its fantasy of geriatric escape ""Up"" taps into a discontent our youth-obsessed culture rarely notices. The films smart enough though to pack a stowaway Russell (Jordan Nagai) an egg-shaped little kid and enthusiastic Wilderness Explorer looking to get his elderly-assistance merit badge. The duos journey by balloon-lofted house is exciting and funny and just when you wonder where its going to lead the movie dumps us into a make-believe South American wonderland. There be monsters here and one of thems a person. None of these monsters are genuinely scary - the movie brings on a snarling pack of talking dogs but gives its leader Alpha (screenwriter Bob Peterson) the voice of Alvin the Chipmunk. The inherent kid-friendliness of ""Up"" extends to its use of 3-D as a way to convey the vastness of the South American landscape rather than as an assault weapon; you wont miss a thing if you see it in 2-D and hows that for subversive?Fellow travelers attach themselves to Carl and Russell a giant gooney bird nicknamed Kevin (its a she) an outcast talking dog named Dug (Peterson again). One of the great pleasures of ""Up"" is that the bird acts like a bird and the dog talks exactly the way a dog would think with sudden timeouts for imaginary squirrels and a genetic predisposition for tennis balls. Not one frame or line of dialogue here lacks wit; you could ignore the plot entirely and subsist happily on the craftsmanship of details - the way Carls hand casually falls over Ellies painted handprint on their mailbox their souls united despite death.There is a plot obviously and it involves the ancient explorer Muntz gone barmy in pursuit of the gooney bird over the decades. ""Up"" thus comes down to a pitched battle between two old coots a kid a dog and a surrealists idea of an ostrich. Director Pete Docter (he helmed ""Monsters Inc."" and co-wrote ""WALL-E"") manages the difficult feat of keeping the action aloft while conjuring a sense of ripe emotional weariness; the stakes are high because this is an old mans last chance to find any meaning in life. Because the movies grounded its free to fly where it wants and it does so with an exuberance and poignancy that at times feels majestic.For those whove done their time in the valley of childrens literature ""Up"" glances off any number of classic tales Carls hemmed-in cottage evokes ""The Little House"" of Virginia Lee Burton for instance and Dug the dog carries echoes of the beloved Tock of ""The Phantom Tollbooth."" With its airborne action ballet though - not to mention its intertwining of fantasy and hushed emotional depth - ""Up"" primarily calls to mind the films of Japanese animation great Hayao Miyazaki.Theres a satisfying sense of payback in that. Lasseters a longtime Miyazaki fan whose legacy includes bringing the directors work to America (Disney will release ""Ponyo"" in August) and when this movie debuted at Cannes this month Lasseter affirmed that ""Miyazaki is in all the Pixar films."" With ""Up"" his company has at last achieved something to stand with the master - a work dreamlike delicious and strange.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

The buoyant Pixar escapade soars and our hearts along with it. An optimistic tale about a pessimistic septuagenarian this lovely film darts unpredictably between comedy and adventure defying gravity and age.How much do I love this movie? If it were mathematically possible Id give it five stars out of four.As whimsical as it is fantastic Up suggests that age is no impediment to daring nor youth to maturity. Its been a long time since a movie has touched me so deeply while lifting me so high.Shifting from serious to slapstick to magical the movie introduces a grumpy old man disgusted with his neighbors - and floats him off to a wondrous anime universe inhabited by a psychedelic cassowary and chatty canines.Carl Fredericksen is 78. He lives in a patiently restored Victorian surrounded by encroaching development like a vintage gramophone among iPods. Carl (the sandpapery voice of Ed Asner) is himself a Victorian among millennials out of place out of time and alone. Carl and Ellie his late wife always had planned to travel and have kids. Lifes script turned out otherwise but no less sweet.Without Ellie the retired balloon vendor with the block head bulb nose and Chiclets teeth has become a sourball. Developers want to buy his house and send him off to Cranky Acres or whatever they call those geriatric warehouses that are Gods waiting rooms.Russell (voice of Jordan Nagai) a most persistent ""Wilderness Explorer"" who resembles an overblown balloon draped with a sash of badges badgers Carl wanting to escort him across the street as a means of marking another scouting achievement.Feeling the weight of the world in his arthritic joints Carl fastens a mountain of helium-filled inflatables to his roof and drifts toward the heavens. Carls home airship gives new meaning to ""armchair traveler."" Oh the places he goesThe exhilarating film pays tribute to Buster Keatons The Balloonatic by way of its slapstick and to Hayao Miyazakis Howls Moving Castle by way of its watercolor palette and traveling domicile. Yet Pete Docter and Bob Petersons film is consistently original and surprising. Up easily tops the Pixar heights reached by Toy Story 2 Monsters Inc. Finding Nemo and The Incredibles.(No surprise there Docter directed Monster House and Peterson wrote Finding Nemo. He deserves an Oscar - not just a nomination - for Ups nuanced script that plays the heartstrings and funny bones of those from 5 to 105.)The filmmakers poignantly tell Carls backstory in a wordless montage detailing the homebodys loving marriage to Ellie. She was the dreamer who saved pennies for exotic adventures he the practical one who dipped into the jug on rainy days.From a repurposed bottle cap that is a sentimental keepsake to a framed picture of a Venezuelan waterfall every object in their home vibrates with meaning. As he ponders some Big Questions Carl honors vigilantly the mementos Ellie left behind.Is there life after a spouses death? If love can be lost can it also be found? Is adventure exclusively the province of the young? To these questions Up answers yes yes and no as it follows the childless Carl and his fatherless stowaway Russell on a magical journey.Within 10 minutes the filmmakers have so fully and sympathetically established Carl and Russell that they become as emotionally real as Geppetto and Pinocchio - and as physically specific as the nubby stitches on Carls knit vest.Most live-action films selectively focus on foreground or background. Up keeps everything in intense deep focus - simultaneously juggling hyperrealistic characters and their surrealistic setting. Even without 3-D glasses (I saw the movie in 2-D because 3-D makes colors less vivid) the film is three-dimensional engaging heart and mind as few movies do.Dreamers build castles in the air; Carl steers his to paradise. While at first he hopes simply to escape his grief on his journey he is tested by unforeseen challenges. He has internalized Ellie and her pluck helps him accomplish feats beyond his dreams fulfilling hers.In nine feature films Pixar animators have detected the souls of inanimate objects (toys robots) and located high art in low places (a rat/chef). Is it any surprise they could find the adventurer in a couch potato a housebound old man who rather than succumb to death fights for life?Told with a helium-light wit Up shares profound wisdom. In effect it says When adventure comes knocking open the imagination. When love comes knocking open the heart. And when both ring the bell at the same time come out to greet them with open arms.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickeyat 215-854-5402or crickeyphillynews.com.

Share Tweet It took more than 65 years but a Disney company has finally topped the death of Bambis mother on the pathos-and-childhood-trauma scale. Pixar Animations new Up begins with an efficiently brutal sequence encapsulating the life of a thoroughly lovely woman from childhood to death With the studios usual economy and depth of characterization the film goes about making audiences love her then takes her away for good. The point is to let viewers share the grief of her grumpy old widower Carl (Ed Asner) and to humanize him and explain his actions going forward. But as an ancillary effect the sequence proves once again that Pixar is always more concerned about a well-told story than with hedging its bets about whats safe for or even naturally appealing to audiences. That mentality naturally extends through the rest of the film. More so than past Pixar films (The Incredibles Ratatouille Finding Nemo the Toy Story movies etc.) Up goes off in half a dozen wild random directions rather than focusing on a comfortably iconic central story. It begins with Carl as an isolated 78-year-old retiree morosely facing the changing world until he decides to follow through on a long-ago promise to his beloved wife Ellie by visiting South America. Facing the loss of his house--sentimental seat of his memories of Ellie--he uses thousands of helium balloons to take it with him. He and the house (and an accidental stowaway) head off on a typical dreamers quest but as the story gets considerably weirder it becomes less about his original plan and more about how it opens him up to danger and loss of control but still helps him rejoin the world and learn to live in the present. Up isnt as tightly plotted as past Pixar projects which makes it gleefully unpredictable yet less satisfying on a simple gut level; it lacks the familiar rise and fall anticipation and release of most childrens stories as Carls plan gets so thoroughly compromised that the focus and intent of the story are often unclear. But thats part of the point and part of the fun just waiting to see what screenwriter and co-director Bob Peterson (co-writer of Finding Nemo) comes up with next. Much like that rich tragic opening the rest of Up is challenging emotionally and narratively but it trusts viewers to keep up; Pixar has never been interested in talking down to children or their parents.

Spooked by memories of a similar rebellion in 1988 the government shut down the Internet and local media and banned foreign journalists from covering the demonstrations which were led by Buddhist monks and students with growing support from an emboldened public. Burma VJ takes us on a roller coaster of alternating hope and despair as the young guerrilla reporters always on the lookout for ubiquitous informers wade into the thick of the struggle with Handycams hidden in bags then transmit the footage to a hidden colleague who smuggles it out of the country via satellite. The raw shocking images of courage and brutal backlash here enhanced by added voiceover from two anguished young cameramen were then broadcast uncanned and unpolished by the mainstream media. There was no happy ending but if Burma VJs account of the efficacy of dictatorship threatens to crush you the sight of a sturdy young back disappearing into the mountains returning from a Thailand hideout for another round of bearing witness should make your heart burst. (Sunset 5) (Ella Taylor) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - DANCE FLICK The Wayans clan peaked with their 1988 blaxploitation parody Im Gonna Git You Sucka. Their 2000 hit Scary Movie a parody of umm scary movies begat a series of even broader lamer send-ups the Wayans had nothing to do with (Epic Movie Date Movie Disaster Movie et al.). Their new spoof of umm dance flicks almost seems laudable by comparison. Directed by next-gen newcomer Damien Dante Wayans and co-written with uncles Keenen Ivory Shawn Marlon and cousin Craig the movie merges the plot of Save the Last Dance -- former ballerina and Juilliard hopeful distraught by her mothers tragic car accident discovers street dancing and interracial romance at an inner-city school -- with boob fart and ghetto jokes. Shoshana Bush heads up a cast that includes Wayanses young and old (Damon Jr. as her love interest his father as a loan shark in a fat suit) but comically and literally Bush is a pale imitation of Anna Faris. The gags themselves only marginally work when they stick to silly non sequitur; the random movie references are forced and flat and the takeoffs of Dreamgirls and Fame songs would make Weird Al groan. Better than nothing Amy Sedaris steals it as Ms. Cameltoe a wicked teacher who beatboxes with her bulbous vagina. Yes its rated PG-13 except its also inappropriate for anyone older than 13. (Citywide) (Aaron Hillis)GO  DEPARTURES Trailing mostly justified ill will for having trounced the critical favorite Waltz With Bashir for Best Foreign Film at last years Oscars Yojiro Takitas stately Japanese movie Departures a runaway hit at home enters American theaters at a disadvantage. But this solemn chamber piece about a depressive young city cellist (former boy-band singer Masahiro Motoki) who discovers his vocation and his better self practicing the ancient art of corpse beautification in a provincial funeral parlor has its minor charms. Initially disgusted by the stigma of working with the ""unclean"" dead this remote subliminally angry young man soon finds himself strangely moved by the stories of the dead and the gratitude of the grieving relatives who gather to watch him spiff up their loved ones. Self-healing looms all too visibly on the horizon but Takitas unpretentious classicism and his candid delight in nature work their way into our sympathies along with the plaintive cello pieces by composer Joe Hisaishi who scored such Miyazaki treasures as My Neighbor Totoro and Howls Moving Castle. Amid the culture of cheating and heedless one-upmanship that has brought the globe to its knees its a lovely thing to meet a movie that refuses to divorce what it means to be a professional from what it means to be a mensch. (ArcLight Hollywood; The Landmark; Playhouse 7) (Ella Taylor)GO  DRAG ME TO HELL Often a drifting virtuoso in the years before finding his Spider-Man gig with Drag Me to Hell director Sam Raimi defaults to the horror romps that made his name (namely the Evil Dead trilogy). Drag Me has a serendipitously timely victim Playing a bank loan officer Alison Lohman bears the brunt of the films supernatural humiliations. Lohmans Christine Brown is putting the finishing touches on her self-reinvention as a young professional eye on a promotion renting L.A. hillside real estate and heading toward marriage with an up-market boyfriend. One day smothering her conscience to impress her boss Christine refuses to take pity on an ancient Gypsy woman about to lose her home (Lorna Raver with a malevolent dead eye horking up neon phlegm). The hag hisses a hex and Christines life plan is derailed by a chain of diabolical interventions She spouts a geyser nosebleed at work is ambushed by hallucinations while meeting potential in-laws and starts studying animal sacrifice. A visit to a psychic confirms Christines had a demon sicced on her and if it isnt appeased in time shell get the title treatment. Still being bonged on the head with a cross for forgetting the Golden Rule doesnt indicate a particularly nuanced moral vision. Does Raimi -- who began his career on a shoestring in the Tennessee woods and now commands 300 million bonanzas -- actually believe professional ambition should be punished with eternal damnation?

Sep. 13 600pm GO  UP The 10th feature-length film from the Pixar studios suggests what Clint Eastwoods Gran Torino might have looked like if instead of standing his ground Eastwoods Walt Kowalski had simply attached a few thousand helium balloons to his ramshackle craftsman and lifted off into the atmosphere. Thats precisely the course of action taken by Ups own cantankerous septuagenarian widower Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner channeling Walter Matthau) after a physical altercation with a man half his age threatens to land him in a retirement home for the rest of his days. Carl even comes complete with his own Asian-American protege in the form of pudgy diminutive Russell an 8-year-old Junior Wilderness Explorer who ends up accompanying him on his intercontinental journey to the jungles of South America. There Carl plans to deposit his flying house at the edge of the waterfall he had always intended to visit with his late wife Ellie -- an act of noblesse oblige that recalls the cross-country tractor journey undertaken by the title character of David Lynchs The Straight Story. Up which was directed by Monsters Inc.s Pete Docter doesnt put forth an entire worldview like the films of Ratatouille director Brad Bird or employ the sort of formal invention of last years WALL-E but it is hardly without its own novelties and pleasures. For starters its one of the only animated films in which the main characters are all ordinary human beings who inhabit a recognizable real world devoid of superheroes fairy-tale princesses and giant green ogres. Its also unexpectedly ambitious in its use of period with an opening act that stretches from the 1930s to the present neatly encapsulating the triumphs and tragedies of Carl and Ellies marriage (including what Im quite certain is the first Pixar miscarriage) in one dazzling montage sequence. Even the movies somewhat more programmatic second half in which Carl and Russell square off against an eccentric explorer (Christopher Plummer) hell-bent on capturing an exotic species of local fauna proves to be a far more rousing Indiana Jones-style caper than last seasons Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. And there is one flash of authentic comic genius a pack of hunting dogs equipped with high-tech collars that translate their thoughts into human voices. Finally Up emerges as a gentle hymn to adventure of both the soaring storybook variety and the smaller less obvious kind -- the perilous unpredictable and richly rewarding journey of ordinary everyday life. (Citywide) (Scott Foundas)WHAT GOES UP Shed a tear if you will for Hilary Duff. Having finished her stint as Lizzie McGuire five years ago shes too old for the Disney Channel factory and cant compete with shinier newer models like the Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus. But this is rock bottom Ive seen a lot of terrible movies in the line of duty but What Goes Up might be the only genuinely unreleasable one. Co-writer/director Jonathan Glatzer makes dark allusions in the press kit to losing much of his budget and shooting time just a few weeks before starting. I feel for him. But the result is that a movie starring Hilary Duff is nearly as cubist as say Alain Resnais Muriel -- and almost as hard to follow. I think this was supposed to be a standard-issue Sundance comedy but I have no idea whats going on. Suffice it to say that Steve Coogan is a cynical reporter who comes to a small town and starts lusting after teen girls and tries to get into Duffs pants in a parody of the Romeo amp; Juliet balcony scene and is redeemed. Or something. (Sunset 5; Playhouse 7; Town Center 5) (Vadim Rizov) Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact LA Weekly Follow LA Weekly laweekly L.A.

Theres a hint early on in Up that something equally as bitter and blissful may be in store. A wordless montage follows two youngsters--Carl and Ellie--as they become best friends get married dream of a South American Shangri-la and grow old together. Then Ellie dies. Given the choice between the nursing home or freedom Carl opts for escape. And thats when we get The Moment A modest house miraculously held aloft by brightly colored balloons floats past apartment windows and glides slowly silently into a sea of clouds. Theres nowhere to go but earthward after that yet to its credit Up keeps things buoyant even as it descends into the business of dominating the Happy Meal demographic. A Weeble-like kid has stowed away on Carls flying home and the duo sets sail in search of the mythic Amazonian paradise. Adventure ensues; chase scenes and literal cliff-hangers thrill even when theyre choreographed in gratuitous 3-D (the gimmick is meant to distract filmgoers from bankrupt artistry so whats it doing affixed to a Pixar movie?). You could suffer through worse climaxes than an air fight between a zeppelin canine-piloted biplanes and a three-bedroom colonial. If such first-rate entertainment simply offers a remarkably fun experience instead of a life-changing one its only because weve come to regularly expect epiphanies from its creators. But Up more than does the Michelangelos of mainstream animation proud; it still soars miles above every multiplex offering out there.

This guiding philosophy soars in Up  one of the most emotional movies yet - and the first in 3-D - from the animation masters of Disney/Pixar.Up upholds Pixars sterling reputation  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 28 2009 Up (out of 4)Pixar animated comedy featuring the voices of Ed Asner Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai. Directed by Pete Docter. At AMC Yonge and Dundas. ""For every laugh there should be a tear"" the late Walt Disney used to say. This guiding philosophy soars in Up one of the most emotional movies yet - and the first in 3-D - from the animation masters of Disney/Pixar.Directed by Monsters Inc. helmer Pete Docter (with co-direction and co-writing by Bob Peterson) it upholds Pixars sterling reputation with a romantic and quixotic adventure about a grumpy septuagenarian determined to fulfill a ""cross my heart"" promise made to his late wife.The questing codger is Carl Fredericksen (Ed Asner) a 78-year-old balloon salesman with a head like a lantern but an attitude like a spent match. Hes marking time toward oblivion having recently lost Ellie the love of his life.A heart-rending prologue establishes their bond from adventurous kids to childless-but-happy seniors. Young Carl and Ellie are fascinated by newsreel reports of an explorer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) who vanished after his claims of discovering a rare giant bird were contested by skeptical scientists.Carl and Ellie promise each other theyll one day go on safari to Muntzs mysterious Paradise Falls in the jungles of South America. Life interferes to push ""one day"" out of reach until old age and Ellies death finally dash their dream.Fate ingenuity and a nod to The Wizard of Oz get the dream aloft once more. Faced with impending eviction from his home and exile to a seniors residence Carl fights back by strapping thousands of helium balloons to his house each one of them moving independently thanks to Pixars awesome attention to detail. They lift him toward the South American sojourn hed always intended to take.""Adventure is out there"" goes the trekkers mantra. It also applies to beefy 8-year-old stowaway Russell (Jordan Nagai) an apparently parentless scout who needs to assist Carl to earn his final merit badge.Up is a story of human bonds remembered and new ones forged and never for one moment does it seems insincere or contrived. Not even when an avian freak resembling a toucan version of Sesame Streets Big Bird shows up and is promptly named ""Kevin"" by Russell. Kevin has trouble flying but the movie never does whether you see it in 3-D or good ol 2-D.This is an updated version of a review originally published during the Cannes Film Festival.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

MOVIN ON UP Pixar reaches 10th movie milestone TIMELINE Pixar team looks back at its creations so far Adventure comes in many forms and can happen at any stage of life. Disney/Pixars Up conveys that message through an artful blend of exhilaration and poignancy. The company that created WALLE Ratatouille and the Toy Story movies maintains its standard of excellence. Up will elicit a giddy joy among audience members with its gorgeous visuals and glossy 3-D animation. But the films exquisite emotional depth puts it in a category of its own. Wordlessly co-directors Bob Peterson and Pete Docter capture the full measure of a mans life in what may be the most touching and effective montage sequence ever. All too often a montage functions as padding rather than narrative illustration. Here in about eight minutes accompanied by Michael Giacchinos evocative score Up wondrously conveys the highs lows and middles of a life that is both ordinary and extraordinary. Balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen (voiced superbly by Edward Asner) has long felt the heart of an adventurer beating within. Early on he meets and falls in love with the adventurous Ellie (Elie Docter). Content and comfortable they dont venture much farther than their cozy home. When opportunity knocks Carl seizes the chance to fulfill his dream. Propelled aloft by thousands of balloons he ventures to an exotic land that he and Ellie had dreamed of visiting. Scenes of soaring over the city are among the movies best. The expedition takes a turn when Carl is joined by Russell (Jordan Nagai) an ebullient Scout. They meet Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) a disgraced explorer and dog trainer. Segments involving the dogs who speak are the movies funniest. Easily the summers and probably the years most enchanting movie Up is a buoyant delight. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

The story follows a pint-size wannabe aviator and his tomboy best pal through courtship and a blissful but earthbound marriage; years later the hero now a bitter old widower (given voice by Ed Asner) rigs his home with hundreds of helium balloons in hopes of making the South American trip hed always promised his wife. When he and a young stowaway (Jordan Nagai) land in a mountain jungle populated by a gangly rare bird and a pack of talking dogs the elderly crank finds himself way out of his comfort zone. Writer-directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson present hilarious insights into bird brains and canine psychology and treat thornier human emotions deftly ending with the felicitous truth that only by letting go of the past can we free ourselves to soar.

Disney/Pixar By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 14 2009 1201 a.m. ET In the spirit of high adventure -- the same spirit that guides the buoyant heart of its venerable hero Carl Fredricksen -- ""Up"" dares to explore the full sweep of a mans life from young love shining hopes and tragic loss to the perplexities and possibilities of old age. In the spirit of candor accompanied by regret I must say that I admired the film much more than I enjoyed it. Pixars 10th full-length production tells its tale in comic terms for the most part and with gorgeous imagery dominated by the spectacle of a cozy house carried aloft by thousands of balloons. Nevertheless Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) is 78 years old when he takes off in his beloved house for the paradise he dreamed of visiting with his late wife. A cantankerous septuagenarian at the center of a family entertainment represents an extraordinary gamble for a studio and the ante was upped last night when the film made its debut at the Cannes Film Festival; its the first time the festival has opened with an animated feature. Pixars ""Up"" directed by Pete Docter from a screenplay co-written with Bob Peterson. ""Up"" was directed by Pete Docter from a screenplay he wrote with Bob Peterson who served as co-director. The story begins with an affectionate takeoff on a 1930s Fox Movietone newsreel one that celebrates the exploits of an explorer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) in Paradise Falls a South American land ""lost in time."" In the audience sits the boy Carl Fredricksen once was wide-eyed behind the goggles of his junior aviators helmet. Soon the funny little kid meets his soul mate a quirky little girl named Ellie who shares his passion for faraway places. But then the tone changes and the movie announces its soaring ambition by distilling decades of the couples life into four minutes or so of a silent montage accompanied only by Michael Giacchinos exquisite waltz music. Journal Community Discuss Whats your favorite Pixar movie? Any heart that isnt moved by this lyrical passage must be made of stone. Its the essence of daring the sort of thing that only Pixar would try to do let alone do wondrously well. And theres an admirably intransigent quality to what comes next a portrait of Carl as a widower living alone in the home that he and Ellie shared. By now the once-pastoral house is surrounded by urban hubbub and Carl is under pressure from all sides a melancholy old man who looks like a cross between a scrunched-down Spencer Tracy and the bucket of a front loader. Thats when life forces itself on him in the corpulent person of 8-year-old Russell (Jordan Nagai) a relentlessly earnest Asian-American Junior Wilderness Explorer who is shaped like a top and bent on earning an assisting-the-elderly merit badge. Its also when my first doubts set in. Russell is amusing in an insistent way but hes so repetitive that you wonder if hes meant to be mentally challenged and he becomes as much of a strident nuisance as Carl first makes him out to be. Carl for his part sustains a likable facade of Buster Keaton gruffness but that wears thin and repetitive too. You want to love the old geezer just as you want to love your grumpy grandpa and youre grateful to the filmmakers for steering clear of sentimentality. Yet the characterizations are fairly coarse cartoons in contrast to the emotionally rich cartoons that have become Pixars hallmark. Theyre more schematic than organic and that applies to the plotting as well. The movie does give us a couple of flashes of its hero as a young man selling balloons at an amusement park. Still the big moment when all those helium balloons pour out from the open roof of Carls house struck me as an arbitrary notion with negligible preparation a kind of unearned triumphalist fantasy that bespeaks music video more than Pixar revelation. (And a derivative one helium balloons lifted the title character to the skies in the 2003 Australian comedy ""Danny Deckchair."") ENLARGE A scene from Pixars 10th full-length production Up. Disney/Pixar Once the trip is under way with Russell on board and stormy weather evoking the flying house in ""The Wizard of Oz"" the movie undergoes a mood transplant. Paradise Falls turns out to be a land of spectacular beauty populated by creatures who wouldnt be out of place in a routine Disney feature a big rare and endearingly droll flightless bird named Kevin a pack of vicious dogs tracking him down -- the dogs may be terrifying for very young children -- and one breakaway member of that pack Dug who proves to be the definition of geniality and the soul of canine loyalty. (We know this for a fact because he wears a high-tech collar that translates his doggie thoughts into human words.) Theres also an evocation of ""Fitzcarraldo"" as Carl and Russell tug the house through the jungle toward the falls -- a rather bland and barely effortful evocation since the house still hovers above them -- and the reappearance of the adventurer Charles Muntz who is far from the inspirational figure Carl and Ellie once found him to be. Muntzs dogs flying biplanes armed with machine guns evoke the aerial killers in ""King Kong"" while his zeppelin seems a homage to the visionary animation of Hayao Miyazaki. (I saw the film in 3-D which is impressive without being intrusive. Theres no reason to think the 2-D version will suffer significantly by comparison.) One of the films recurrent grace notes is a coalescing of puffy clouds into concrete forms -- whatever the beholder wants to feel and see. The same holds true of the film itself. It provides the characters and visual poetry on which to project our deepest feelings about the persistence of love the power of friendship and the joy of embracing life toward the end of life. That process of projection may work so well that Pixars gamble will pay off; the early reviews preceding the Cannes debut have been ecstatic. Im still left though with an unshakable sense of ""Up"" being rushed and sketchy a collection of lovely storyboards that coalesced incompletely or not at all. The one exception apart from that silent montage is the movies most ephemeral element the music. Mr. Giacchino has written some marvelous scores -- for Pixars ""Ratatouille"" and ""The Incredibles"" as well as for the new ""Star Trek."" This one though is something else -- touching lilting swooping stirring heartbreakingly elegiac with intimations of Scott Joplin Randy Newman and even Charles Ives yet altogether original and irresistible.

You may have a better time at the movies this year but I cant imagine it. Up Directors Pete Docter Bob Peterson. Cast Ed Asner Christopher Plummer Jordan Nagai. Rating PG for some peril and action. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Asner is up for another role as lovable grump Up makers continue Pixars magic touch Disneys best Movies to fuel your wanderlust Yes thats the kind of thing you read in a movie review and roll your eyes at thinking it must be hyperbole. But in this case its genuine and heartfelt. ""Up"" is a great film. Its also a complex film. Thats not unheard of in an animated movie particularly one from Pixar the studio that numbers the ""Toy Story"" films ""WALL-E"" and ""Finding Nemo"" among its credits. ""Up"" outshines them all - unheard-of praise indeed - in part because it deals with life loss and love in ways both relatable and entertaining. What else is there? Fun. And loads of it. There are so many delights to discover here that going into too much detail about the story would take away from the experience. Briefly ""Up"" is the tale of Carl (the voice of Ed Asner) a grumpy old man a retired balloon salesman living alone. The beginning of the film tells us how Carl got there. The child Carl meets Ellie the love of his life. Ellie shares Carls taste for adventure - theyre both fans of legendary explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Muntz is disgraced when hes accused of faking his findings so he returns to South America vowing to bring back live evidence. Meanwhile Carl and Ellie begin their life together. They save pennies in a glass jar hoping to embark on an adventure of their own but fate has other plans as we learn in a brilliant wordless segment that encompasses the whole of their lives - good bad and tragic; it is as beautiful as it is moving an epic tale told in less than five minutes. This brings us up-to-date where after a dustup with developers who covet the land his house is on Carl ties balloons to the place and takes off for South America the destination of his boyhood hero. To his deep disappointment he discovers that exuberant Junior Wilderness Explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) has tagged along for the trip. Its quite a journey - Carl hasnt exactly chosen the most stable form of travel - and once theyre in South America bigger surprises await. Some are funny (some hilarious) some are scary (in a PG sort of way) most are exciting. All are enlightening. Along the way Carl learns with Russells help that lifes biggest adventures are sometimes found closest to ones heart. ""Up"" is notable not only for what it is - a terrific piece of filmmaking - but for what its not. Directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson (Peterson wrote the screenplay as well) bow to no trendy conventions. The protagonist of the film is after all an old man and a grouchy one at that. Russell is a pudgy little guy about as far down on the cool scale as its possible to get. Yet through its writing direction and execution ""Up"" doesnt just achieve hipness it transcends it. With its spirit of fun and adventure it echoes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (only funnier) - its a thrill ride but a thrill ride with heart. And while the technology used to make it is ultra-contemporary ""Up"" could have been made in any age. Be glad it was made in this one because its fantastic.

"TBO.com Tampa Bay Online. | Print Click here to print URL http//www.tbo.com/movies/imagination-takes-flight-in-up-84916 Imagination takes flight in Up By TBO.com Published May 28 2009 Updated March 22 2013 at 0821 PM ""Up."" The title is deceptively simple which is fitting because the latest achievement from Pixar Animation is deeper and more complex on every level than it would initially appear.Its a classic B-movie exotic adventure the kind that inspired Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to make ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but its told through the most high-tech gorgeous 3-D animation.Its a mismatched buddy comedy the kind weve seen countless times before but the buddies are a curmudgeonly 78-year-old man and a tubby 8-year-old boy who wind up together in a flying house traveling to South America.As with many family films that get pumped out each summer it has talking dogs. But its how the dogs talk and what they say that are truly inspired and oddly realistic.Pete Docter (Pixars ""Monsters Inc."") and co-director and writer Bob Peterson turn their imagination this time to human beings rare creatures in the animated kingdom. But between the richness of the characters the meatiness of their interaction and the authenticity of the details it wont take you long to forget that ""Up"" is a cartoon and become immersed.We begin about 70 years ago when Carl Fredricksen was just a boy worshipping the glamorous explorer Charles F. Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer). Even then Carl moved with the quiet cautiousness of an old man - that is until he meets the energetic tomboy Ellie who brings out the fun he never knew he had inside him.""Up"" shares their decades-long romance in a lovely poignant montage. It lasts just a few minutes without a single word spoken - just Michael Giacchinos wistful score to accompany the images - but it tells a full and satisfying story. Dont even bother holding back the tears Theyll come and deservedly so.From there though theres nowhere to go but up literally. Now a crusty widower facing eviction and an antiseptic life in a retirement community - and voiced perfectly by Ed Asner - the former balloon salesman ties thousands of helium balloons to his house and soars into the clouds. His eventual destination Paradise Falls in Venezuela where he and Ellie always promised each other theyd go. (The reflections of the balloons rainbow hues are wondrous as he floats past streets and buildings.)Carl has an unexpected passenger though Russell (endearing newcomer Jordan Nagai) an overeager Junior Wilderness Explorer who had knocked on Carls door hoping to earn the final badge he needs to become a senior scout assisting the elderly. They make an unlikely but lovable pair the rigid Carl (who resembles a latter-day Spencer Tracy with his linear mouth square-shaped glasses and bushy white hair) and the ebullient Russell. Their bond is sweet their journey joyous.Peril lies along the way too although ""Up"" is suitable for the whole family; one of the most striking images is of the small rickety house drifting toward a wall of ominous thunder clouds. Once they reach Paradise Falls they find themselves surrounded by a pack of attack dogs. Among them is the lovable Dug (voiced by Peterson) a mutt whos just so darn happy to meet new people he instantly insists Carl become his master.Dug like the other dogs roaming the rain forest has been outfitted by his mysterious owner with a collar that voices his thoughts. This might be the most ingenious invention ever and Dugs canine ramblings provide the chief source of consistent comedy in ""Up.""We wont tell you the direction ""Up"" goes from here. Well just say its creative and unexpected.MOVIE REVIEW""Up"" 1/2MOVIE BOARD RATING PG; for some peril and actionSTARS Ed Asner Jordon Nagai Christopher PlummerDIRECTOR Pete Docter Bob PetersonLOCATION See movie times Page 8 for local showtimes.PLOT SUMMARY A widower ties balloons to his house to make a long-anticipated trip to South America but things get a little complicated when he discovers an 8-year-old stowaway on board.RUNNING TIME 90 minutesON THE WEB http//disney.go.com/disneypictures/up",http://tbo.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?avis=TB&date=20090528&category=ARTICLE&lopenr=305289994&Ref=AR&profile=1109&template=printart,200,up32,up,com/apps/pbcs
"movie review Up Up Disney-Pixar Disney Pixar Ed Asner - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Up -- 4 out of 5 stars Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) and Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) Disney/Pixar Disney/Pixar Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Up is the movie in which Pixar makes it look easy. A feather-light farce with a delicious dose of the sentimental it isnt the animation companys biggest most complicated or even its best. Its just a film in which most every oddball element of an odd yet familiar story works.Up shown in 3D in select theaters is about an aged balloon vendor who inflates his left-over merchandise and flies his house to South America. A Wilderness Explorer (They cant call him a Cub Scout) tags along by accident to annoy him. Once there they find talking dogs a gigantic fabled bird and adventure. And thats pretty much it.But the grumpy old man is voiced by Ed Asner perfect foil for a too-chatty chubby kid (Jordan Nagai). ""Lets play a game. Its called Who can be quiet the longest?|""""My mom loves that game""The dogs have been given collars that allow their every whimper and bark to become spoken words.""SQUIRREL"" And the magic is there right from the start -- a 1930s newsreel about a famous disgraced explorer a newsreel seen by a couple of goofy children in adventure gear kids obsessed with that explorer. Theyre a boy and a girl who find each other and are set for life. Were treated to a lovely dialogue-free montage of the love affair that was their life together. They save for their ""big adventure"" but life keeps getting in the way.Ellie is gone now. But the love affair goes on. And Carl Fredrickson is determined to see the dream that they deferred -- that trip to Amazonia -- through.""Adventure is out there""Within 10 minutes Up directed by the guy who turned the conceit that monsters in the closet collect kids screams into Monsters Inc. (Pete Docter) has cast its spell. After that its all in the execution. How would a house hanging from thousands of balloons steer? (Curtains turned into sails.) How will they avoid collisions? How will they get down? Who might they find when they get there?The third-act action is whiz-bang stuff involving the balloon house vintage fighter planes a zeppelin and one very big but very subtle lesson.Lifes adventures arent just ""out there."" Theyre here too wherever life is lived and love is shared. And its not photos or mementos that matter; its the memories of those adventures that keep us warm when were old.Up is preceded by an equally sweet short cartoon Partly Cloudy. Its about the clouds storks fly to so they can pick up babies for delivery and one clumsy little cloud that only seems to handle the problem infants -- baby alligators electric eels porcupines -- and the hapless stork who delivers them. Pixar makes this look as effortlessly sweet and funny as everything else they do. Roger Moore can be reached at 407-420-5369 or rmooreorlandosentinel.com.

Such of course is the perception advanced by promotional materials which sell short the latest Pixar picture the first American animated offering ever to open le Festival de Cannes.That is not to fault the trailer loaded with pretty pictures and pratfalls intended to woo the wee ones. But it doesnt prepare you for the emotional punch of Ups first few minutes when it presents the most heartfelt--the most sincere--love story in recent memory the love between a boy and a girl who become a man and a woman who become a husband and a wife who become a widower and a memory that haunts the rest of what follows. The first 10 minutes of Up are flawless; the final 80 minutes close enough. (Though note this Do not see Up in 3-D. Its inessential to the tale and altogether distracting.)The movie begins in a theater with young Carl Fredricksen through aviator goggles reveling in the black-and-white newsreel adventures of the thrill-seeking Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer) for whom ""Adventure is out there"" Through happenstance little Carl (voiced barely by Jeremy Leary) soon meets fellow traveler Ellie (Elie Docter) and with her sets out on an adventure that will last the rest of his life--a journey that includes crushing blows (Ellie cant have children) and modest highs (the simple joy of renovating a decaying house till it becomes a Technicolor dream home). The would-be world travelers stay at home till Ellies final breath restless but content just to be with each other--in other words Revolutionary Road but with love. Had Up ended after those first few minutes that would have been enough for some; at a recent preview screening you could hear the adults sniffle. But behind me a little girl asked her grandfather with great apprehension ""Is that the end of the movie?"" She clearly hoped not.Rest assured it gets funny. And its thrilling too as the third act takes place almost entirely in the sky atop the mammoth zeppelin piloted by Muntz who as it turns out has been in self-exile in South America searching for a mythical bird whose existence hes been trying to prove for decades at the expense of his sanity.But despite its title Up is decidedly earthbound The elderly Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) spends almost the entire movie schlepping his house across the South American landscape his wife had always hoped to visit. Carl is literally tethered to a memory an anchor with a garden hose wrapped around his torso to keep his home from floating away. And hes kept company by an accidental intruder Russell (Jordan Nagai) an even more awkward version of the youthful Carl. The two are meant for each other the husband without a wife the son without a father each in desperate need of companionship and adventure lest they disappear.Perhaps by now all of this sounds so unbearably sad and undeniably grown-up but only because it is. Pixar movies have been moving in this direction for years--adult animation sprinkled with just enough shenanigans to entertain the kids while we get our weep on. Consider the protagonists adults stuck in the middle and on their way further down but trying like hell to claw back up. Monsters Inc. directed by Up co-director Pete Docter was about mid-level drones sick of their jobs; The Incredibles superheroes sick of suburban mediocrity; Ratatouille a rat escaping the filthy sewer for a five-star kitchen. To that estimable lot add Carl who waited till he was alone and at the end of his life to discover how much living was left to be done.

"Up | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; up ) Up (United States 2009) May 26 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli A film like Up makes it clear that Pixar has moved beyond the point where it feels the need to pander to children. Unlike its main animation competitor Dreamworks Pixar allows sophisticated themes and ideas to seep into its movies. Everything does not have to be simplified so that a seven-year old can understand whats going on. Thats not to say that Pixar films should be seen as family unfriendly art films. Up for example includes plenty of jokes that kids will get and several unremarkable action scenes have been included with younger viewers in mind but theres material of real substance - something increasingly lacking in animated films not tagged with the ""Disney"" label. Up is not as transcendent as last years WALL-E and doesnt rank near the top of Pixars pantheon of great features but its a solid (and in some ways innovative) fantasy adventure that mixes comedy action and drama into a satisfying whole that is likely to please all but the most cantankerous curmudgeons. Up falls under the umbrella of a tried-and-true formula the old man/young kid ""buddy film."" This may be however the first time this Hollywood staple has been translated effectively into an animated format. As with most movies of this sort the old guy - 78-year old Carl Fredricksen (voice of Edward Asner) - is a grumpy sort set in his ways and not welcoming of strangers. The young guy - cub scout Russell (Jordan Nagai) - is full of innocence and wide-eyed optimism. During the course of the film the two bond and learn from one another although as is often the case Carls schooling strikes a little deeper. The boy who is a nuisance at the beginning has become a valued companion by the end. From an emotional standpoint the best thing about Up is the prologue. Running about 12 minutes its a masterpiece of economy and it could stand on its own as a short. Its the story of Carl and Ellie - two misfit kids who find in each other perfect matches. They like the same things and play the same games. Both dream of adventuring far and wide when they grow up. Its only natural for them to spend their lives together mixing dreams with reality. They marry face the heartbreak of being unable to have children and spend roughly seven decades with each other as their best friend. Then Ellie dies and Carl is left alone in a house rich with memories where every floorboard is imbued with Ellies presence. As backstories go this matches anything I have seen in any animated motion picture for heft and power. It brings a tear to the eye. Even Miyazaki couldnt have done better. Once Ellie is gone Carl decides to fulfill one of their long-time plans visit Paradise Falls a virtually uncharted place deep in the wilds of Venezuela. It was there that Carl and Ellies childhood hero Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) vanished along with his dirigible during an expedition in the 1930s. To make the trip to South America Carl decides upon an unconventional means he ties thousands upon thousands of helium-filled balloons to his house and lifts off. Unfortunately when the house takes flight theres an unexpected passenger aboard. Russell knocking at the front door with the goal of ""helping an old person"" so he can earn a merit badge is in the wrong place at the wrong time. After Carl and Russell reach their goal (but not precisely where they want to be) Up becomes more conventional in its goals and approach. There are chase scenes talking animals and rotten-to-the-core villain. These are not bad things (and at least theres no Randy Newman song) but they prevent Up from maintaining the incredibly high level it achieves when it begins. Still it will surprise me if any other 2009 animated film comes close to this one in terms of cross-generational appeal. It is worth wondering however if the movie may be too refined to capture the hearts minds and imaginations of children who have become accustomed to the limited pleasures of dumb animation. Up is being offered in both 2D and 3D versions. I saw it in the former and was unaware of missing anything. Unlike some movies this one does not the flaunt its 3D features in a way that those watching it in conventional theaters may feel as if theyre missing something. The colors - especially those of the balloons and the plumage of a giant bird - are bright and cheerful and will almost certainly lose something when diminished by the 3D glasses so theres at least one compelling argument to see this in 2D. Regardless of how its watched Up showcases the fine animation that has become Pixars hallmark. It is not as visionary as what we were presented with in WALL-E but it puts to shame Dreamworks Monsters vs. Aliens where the obsession with 3D resulted in other shortcomings. The vocal work is top-notch. Instead of seeking out big names to fill the roles Pixar has found the ""right"" voices. Edward Asner and Christopher Plummer are not unknowns but neither are they hot A-list stars. Their voices are perfect for these parts and viewers are not left with afterimages of their real-life features burned onto those of the animated characters. Asner as has been noted sounds a lot like Lionel Barrymores Scrooge (a role the late actor played annually in a radio play during the 1930s and 1940s) - an appropriate reference given The Christmas Carol transformation of Carls character - and Plummer has great pipes for suggesting menace. Up is not my favorite Pixar movie but I welcome its arrival. Id rather see dozens of movies like this than one more ugly sequel to Shrek or Madagascar or Ice Age. Pixar views their films as creative and artistic endeavors; Dreamworks and Fox see theirs as products. With Pixar its about the movie. With most other animated features its about the marketing. There are some great moments in Up and it may be the funniest thing Pixar has done in a long time but even the aspects of Up that lack greatness are not bad and thats worth applauding.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Multidimensional Up is as dark and complex and lovely as Wall-E waswith the extra charm of 3-D glasses. _ By David Edelstein Published May 25 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Disney/Pixar) Pixars Up is a small charmer with the studios patented brand of cunning Shock us with an inconsolable woe (predator eats fishs wife and kids; a trash-heap Earth is depopulated save for a robot whose idea of culture is Hello Dolly); then gradually introduce sentiment riotous chases and a rousing cliff-hanger. Works for me If we forgive the more conventional second half of Wall-E (and not everyone does) its because were grateful; were unaccustomed to such devastation in mainstream animation. Were certainly devastated by the overture to Up which centers on a loving couple unable to conceive or to live out the spirit of adventure that brought them together as bright-eyed childrenthen closes with aging and terminal illness. The elderly widower protagonist Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) assaults a contractor and elicits actual bloodblood in a cartoonand is sentenced to sell his beloved house and finish his days in a retirement facility. When he rips said house from its moorings with the aid of an immense tutti-frutti bouquet of helium balloons and hightails it for a South American waterfallthe dream destination of his wifeour sad hearts surge. Directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson are savvy tricksters. The first half of Up is all demented free association with a dream logic both baffling and hilarious. The second half is outlandish but formulaic Jules Verne melodrama with a Captain Nemolike obsessive (Christopher Plummer at his most plangently sinister) plus talking dogs plus a needy fatherless adolescent. In search of a merit badge for assisting the elderly Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) a roly-poly Asian-American wilderness explorer gets caught on the porch when the house lifts off then irritates the old man with his chatter. We know that Fredricksen will become a surrogate dad but Asner has perfected this growly persona He will turn out to have a tender heart but it will never be on his sleeve. The look of Up is a world away from Pixars usual CGI intricaciessimple in a way that only artists with a genius for complexity can achieve. The characters are like wittier Cabbage Patch dolls. Has there ever been a human hero as off-putting yet accessible as Fredricksen with his big square head and big square glasses and big round nose? The geometry is so basic the impact so startling. Russell his tiny eyes nestled in a blob of a face must be the least immediately lovable of animated tykes. But he won me over. As in other Pixar films the relative immobility of the features dries out the sentimentality and draws us in. The movement from inexpressiveness to vulnerability is inexorable. By all means see Up in its 3-D incarnation The cliff drops are vertiginous and the scores of balloonsbunched into the shape of one giant balloonare as pluckable as grapes. The dogfight with canine pilots would have brought a salute from the late Charles M. Schulz. A mammoth multicolored bird with an uncanny resemblance to the monster of the fifties sci-fi picture The Giant Claw sticks its beak into peoples faces and emits a flabbergasting croak You can almost feel the air. Complaints? Once Fredricksens wife Ellie passes away there are no women charactersbut Pixar has always been a boys universe. (Mores the pity Girls like toys too and Coraline demonstrated the fertility of female escape fantasies.) Otherwise the movie is practically a metaphor for Pixars storytelling down down down; up up Up. With editing software you can now transfer films to your computer and recut them which means someone could lop off 45 minutes of this years Oscar-winning foreign-language feature Departures and turn it into a half-decent movie. It has a sublime premise full of the potential for both beauty and horror. A failed professional cellist Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) returns from Tokyo to his hometown and answers an ad for what looks like a travel agency. But in this case departures means an elaborate postmortem ritual in which before the eyes of the deceaseds family the body is elaborately washed made up and encoffined. Daigo takes the job of assisting the brusque owner (Tsutomu Yamazaki) and quickly becomes a pariahunclean even in the eyes of his chirpy supportive little wife (Ryoko Hirosue). Yet on he stumbles. Miserable at the outset he comes to see that the service he performs is vital even holythat watching a loved one encoffined provides the typically buttoned-up Japanese family with a blessed release. The director Yojiro Takita is known for juxtaposing high emotion and low comedy and Departures suggests he could take a little off from each endless cheap tear-jerking fewer cheap laughs. One scene builds to a shockingly unfunny gag Daigo works on what he thinks is a beautiful young girl and then under the sheet bumps up against her male organ. The director takes a sharp turn into bathos as the disapproving father finally accepts his son/daughter and weeps. Its only a matter of time before Daigos duck-voiced wife watches him work with tears in her eyes and understands the nobility of this art. We can see the climax in which Daigo makes postmortem peace with an estranged family member zombie-shuffling toward us for about an hour. Whats sad is that this really is an amazing foundation The metaphor for loss is right there onscreen. It will resonate with anyone who has ever buried a loved one and struggled to reconcile the myriad emotionsgrief anger helplessness. Which is to say everyone. And yet out of this premise comes glop. Departures needed a little more work in the morguelike cutting to the bone. Speaking of zombies Bruce McDonalds Wittgensteinian Canadian zombie-plague picture Pontypool doesnt jellits pretensions way exceed its reachyet its madly suggestive and it rekindled my affection for the genre. Its based on a novel by Tony Burgess but the setup is pure theater four main characters trapped in a radio station in rural Ontario where an egghead incarnation of Don Imus (the acid Stephen McHattie) has been exiled. From scattered news reports and calls it emerges that mobs are inexplicably killing and eating people. Afghanistan and the Middle East have a tangential relationship to the carnage but the virus transcends contemporary politics.Language itself seems to have broken down.

Three years ago for example jetlagged journalists were forced to endure Ron Howards leaden adaptation of The Da Vinci Code after which even the most perversely withholding Eastern European anomie-fest seemed like a comparative breath of fresh air. So when the brass announced some time ago that the new Pixar movie Up would kick things off in 09 Im afraid I immediately assumed that it must be more Cars than WALLE quality-wise. That Up is also Pixars first stab at the suddenly resurgent 3-D format didnt help matters since Ive long despised the grade-school-diorama effect that even newfangled processes inevitably serve up. And then you know the story involves a crotchety old geezer who ties a gazillion ballons to his rickety house and tries to fly it to a South American paradise hed dreamed about as a small child accompanied by a precocious Boy Scout and (I somehow gathered) at least one talking animal. Skepticism pretty much reigned I gotta say. Admitting I was wrong gives me ulcers so let me say this first 3-D is still mostly useless. As employed here (and in Henry Selicks recent Coraline) its not quite the eyeball-gouging distraction that it once was but it doesnt really add much to the experience; the slight pressure of the oversized nerd goggles on the bridge of my nose was far more powerful than the vague sensation of being among the clouds or whatever. It was a dumb gimmick in 1953 and its still a dumb gimmick. This marvelous film doesnt need it. Oookay so I was wrong. Up does occasionally succumb to a slight case of sappiness--its a tale of dreams deferred and theres an Aesopian reminder that the grand adventure youve sought was always right there in your own backyard--but nobody in Hollywood right now can touch primo Pixar for lunatic comic invention and sheer visual splendor. Like WALLE this wry parable continually and confidently shifts from absurdism to pathos and back again beginning with a lovely dazzling montage in which after meeting our hero Carl as a boy in what looks like the 30s we see the entirety of his adult life flash before our eyes. When we finally settle in the present Carl now wrinkled and gray and despondent over the death of his beloved wife resembles Spencer Tracy squashed into the shape of a fireplug and speaks in the querulous voice of Ed Asner. (This may be briefly disconcerting to fans of a certain WB cartoon series of the 90s wholl keep expecting the old coot to say ""Hey Freakazoid wanna go see a three-headed mule?"") But while Carl embarks on pretty much the Journey of Personal Discovery youd expect the narrative keeps veering off course in surprising and surreal ways. Like yes there are talking dogs in this movie but they are like no talking dogs in any animated film in history. Theres also a giant unknown bird that seems to have wandered in from a Max Fleischer picture and a climactic duel between two dudes with major back problems and various other incongruous details I dont care to spoil for you. Whats more the overall look of the film with its breathtaking aerial views of South American landscapes and its symbolic interplay of squares and circles puts every other animation studio to shame. My concern now in fact is that Cannes 09 has begun on such a high note that what follows will seem gravely disappointing by comparison. Keep the bar steady guys. Grade B+. (Remember Im a ridiculous skinflint when it comes to the grades. My B+ is equivalent to at least an A- from Scott Tobias or Noel Murray or just about anyone else on the AVC staff. Up will almost certainly appear on my year-end top ten list.) Day One at Cannes is devoted exclusively to the opening film and to a press conference with the jury which this year is headed by Isabelle Huppert and also includes folks like smoking hot actress Asia Argento Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan smoking hot actress Shu Qi British screenwriter Hanif Kureishi aging but still smoking hot actress Robin Wright Penn (noticing a pattern?) Korean director Lee Chang-dong etc. Consequently the only other film screened for the press today was Spring Fever the latest torporfest from Chinas Lou Ye which is of so little interest that Id just ignore it were there anything to report on. I sort of liked Lous Suzhou River (2000) which was a knowing and sensual Vertigo riff but everything hes done since has been as gorgeously inert as the giant redwoods Scotty and Madeleine admire. Both Purple Butterfly (a passionless simulacrum of a spy thriller) and Summer Palace (80s college student experiences political + sexual awakening audience falls asleep) have a handful of defenders but its hard for me to imagine anyone getting behind this deadly soap opera which involves endless anguished humping and plate-smashing recriminations among a young factory worker her aloof husband the arrogant drag queen her husband is fucking behind her back the amateur private dick hired by the wife to follow the errant husband who turns out (the amateur dick does) to be bisexual and the dicks petulant girlfriend. I think theres meant to be a tender love story buried somewhere in all this remote melodrama but none of the five major characters makes the slightest impression; when one eventually commits suicide you get the sense its mostly just a means of getting the hell out of this boring movie. Most Cannes press screenings conclude with at least a brief round of polite applause but the poor soul who tried to get it started at the end of Spring Fever found no takers whatsoever and gave up after three or four halfhearted claps.

Hows that for an instant boost? The result is a lovely thoughtful and yes uplifting adventure (in 3-D where available) about an old guy a kid and a house that sails through the air opening up new routes in life to people who thought they were stuck in their loneliness. The movie -- which opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival a fresh choice -- is Pixars 10th commanding feature-length demonstration that the most inventive and fully rounded stories in movies today are being told by characters who require an animators hand to breathe. Up is a beaut. And for once 3-D animation proves its worth. (More on that in a moment.) Up is a gentle ride as befits the Walt Disney PG imprimatur. But Ive rarely seen a message of such square sincerity -- Lifes biggest adventures can be found in your own backyard shared with people you love -- told with such unselfconscious joy and bright good humor. Who says squares cant be hip? The star of the saga is a squat sour old widower named Carl (voiced with Lou Grant-quality authority by Ed Asner) a balloon salesman in his late 70s with a head as blockish as a toaster. (Carls boxy black eyeglass frames sitting atop a Patch Adams bulb of a nose only emphasize the set angles of his ways; the guy looks like a cross between Spencer Tracy and an eccentric out of a George Booth cartoon.) We learn that Carls late wife Ellie (who looks related to Helen Parr/Elastigirl from The Incredibles) was the real free spirit and would-be explorer of the family and that the two always planned a trip-of-a-lifetime to a magical waterfall in South America. But daily living got in the way and Carl and Ellie stayed put A short wordless tribute montage reviewing their lives together from childhood through childless marriage and old age is as deeply textured as any great novel. A holdout in the neighborhood while colorless high-rises spring up around him Carl sinks into emotional decrepitude -- until two things happen. First he decides to tie thousands of balloons to his old house and float to South America on his own. (Hes that identifiable type someone afraid of sampling the new without schlepping the familiar along for safety.) Second in the days before takeoff hes visited by a pint-size stranger. An overenthusiastic scouting-type misfit bursting with boyish energy Russell (expressive newcomer Jordan Nagai) is as round and bouncy as a balloon himself. When he becomes an accidental stowaway on Carls great adventure hes unwelcome as far as Carl is concerned. But Russell turns out to be invaluable -- not to mention loyal and trustworthy a friend indeed. Each specimen in the movies wild parade of exotic South American animals is worth cheering and the hilarious acutely observed dogs who greet Carl and Russell in their new world deserve their own canine-centric spin-off feature. Likewise under the tender direction of Pete Docter (Monsters Inc.) every detail of the production is quietly exquisite. (Docter co-wrote the screenplay with Bob Peterson who gets a codirecting credit and also supplies the voice of Dug the dog nerd in the pack.) Michael Giacchinos gorgeous music invoking great Max Steiner scores from the 40s and 50s steers the storys emotional shifts with great elegance. The renderings the color palette the small and generous jokes the perspective as balloons lift a whole house in the air -- all are breathtaking. But the movies most important accomplishment may be that were never noodged or even urged to notice these things. Even the sophisticated effects now attainable in 3-D animation are worth about as much as a bunch of balloons unless we can feel what a character is going through and why. At a press conference at Cannes after the first screening of Up Disney Pixar creative honcho John Lasseter explained that although he loves 3-D as a ""fun toy"" he has no use for disruptive tricks that leap out of the screen. ""3-D should supply depth that furthers the emotion of the scene"" he said. Can complicated technical virtuosity be reduced to something as simple as that? Yes if youre Up to it.

Theres just one problem how do you wipe away a tear while wearing those chunky 3D glasses?Neither a rat nor a robot the films hero is Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner) an elderly man of Middle America who as a youth dreamed of becoming an explorer like Amundsen or Scott. Work and family took over years passed and now hes a long-faced widower living in an old-fashioned home right in the middle of a metropolis. White-haired square-jawed and stout he looks like a more homely version of an older Norman Mailer. To outsiders he appears a frail grump but we know hes mourning his wife and - in some ways - his life.The film is co-directed by Pixar stalwarts Pete Docter and Bob Peterson and - like Wall-E before it - knows the value of silence as well as the need for souped-up action episodes to keep kids awake. As in Wall-E too the most grown-up stuff comes early a brilliant melancholy chapter free of talk runs through Carls life from boyhood to dotage its triumphs and disappointments its a staggeringly effective sad sequence. The story begins as the authorities threaten to place Carl in care after he has a scrap with a property developer looking to bulldoze his home. Carls response to this bureaucratic heavy-handedness is a bugle call to the gods of animation. He ties a thousand balloons to his home and floats off house and all to South America to find the waterfalls which he and his wife always dreamed of visiting. But he doesnt bargain on a passenger. In tow is Russell a podgy child and a wilderness explorer who wants to help Carl cross a road so that he can win an achievement badge.The balloons are a showcase for modern digital animation as they convincingly float and shimmer; the jungle too is a canvas for an explosion of colours and various strange beasts. Theres a touch of Fitzcarraldo as Carl and Russell drag this old mans home through a jungle while fighting off the maniacal ambitions of an even more elderly adventurer who lives in the wilderness. Its not the only element of Up that recalls Herzogs determination to show nature laughing in the face of man. Its a running theme - and gag - throughout. And theres even something of Timothy Treadwell from Grizzly Man about wide-eyed Russell.So Pixar triumphs again with a delirious fantasy that has one leg in the human world of hopes dashed and realised and the other in the cartoon tradition of journeying and adventure. The crisp 3D is never gimmicky and the entire film is blessed with the light and air of bright but never gaudy colours.Watch our interview with co-director Pete Docter and producer Jonas Rivera By Dave Calhoun Posted Wednesday May 13 2009 Details Release details Release date Friday October 16 2009 Duration 96 mins Cast and crew Director Bob Peterson Pete Docter Screenwriter Bob Peterson Find a cinema Search Weve found 2 cinemas showing Up View as map View as list Electric Cinema (Portobello Rd)Electric Cinema (Portobello Rd) 191 Portobello Rd London W11 2ED SatJul 30930amRoyal Albert HallRoyal Albert Hall Kensington Gore London SW7 2AP SatOct 291000am115pm2 Users say (18) 5 out of 5 stars Average User Rating4.7 / 5Rating Breakdown5 star84 star03 star12 star01 star0LiveReviews|181 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshJan 19 2010dangarrobFeaturedI agree with Paul in that this is definitelly below standard Pixar. I do not understand all the hype about it when it came right after ""Wall-E"" which is a true masterpiece and should have been enough to make good a comparison. These are two very different films surely but when Wall-E had magic and moments of pure brilliance ""Up"" can only give provide with a vague sense of nostalgia for the life of the protagonist. the premise is strong enough i.e. The will to make dreams and promises come true even after someones death...but once the baloons have taken off the film goes into B-series territory with no purpose barren and simplistic.

Without a doubt one of the best animated films I have ever seen. The characters are engaging the story well written and executed.

Perhaps its the Disney effect or just that Pixar have lost it but this is a tired rehash of traditional Amercian cartoon themes that never really got off the ground. Disney demand cute kid cute animalsfunny voices and things to productise in abundance forgetting the need for a strong script. Up is no different. No clever dialogue or interesting characterterisations beyond behaps the dogs. If you like watching your dog poo on the pavement and buy it toys then this is probably the cartoon for you. Its a great shame because Pixar can be good but this is below standard. One to take the kids to but dont expect too many laughs for the grown-ups.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 10 2009StaffordFeaturedWOO HOOFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 10 2009StaffordFeaturedWOO HOOFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 16 2009BLAHHHFeaturedTHIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RATED 5-6 starsFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 16 2009BLAHHHFeaturedTHIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RATED 5-6 starsFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/86732/up.html,200,up39,up,timeout

Depending on what you think of ""Cars"" Pixar makes it either 91/2 out of 10 or 10 for 10 with ""Up"" a captivating odd-couple adventure that becomes funnier and more exciting as it flies along. Tale of an unlikely journey to uncharted geographic and emotional territory by an old codger and a young explorer could easily have been cloying but instead proves disarming in its deep reserves of narrative imagination and surprise as well as its poignant thematic balance of dreams deferred and dreams fulfilled. Lack of overtly fantastical elements might endow ""Up"" with a somewhat lower initial must-see factor than some summer releases. But like all of Pixars features this one will enjoy a rewardingly long ride in all venues and formats. Pete Docters picture has the privilege of being the first animated film to open the Cannes Film Festival on May 13. The two leading men are 78 and 8 years old and the age range of those who will appreciate the picture is even a bit wider than that. Like previous classic films about escape from the mundane from ""The Wizard of Oz"" to ""Wall-E"" and many in between ""Up"" is universal in its appeal. At the same time it may be the most subtle Pixar production to date in its use of color schemes shapes proportions scale contrast and balance factors highlighted by the application of 3-D which will be available at many initial engagements. The ghost of Chaplin hovered over ""Wall-E"" and although ""Up"" is a more talkative film it also delves back into earlier eras for inspiration. The first thing on view is a mock 30s-style black-and-white Movietone newsreel documenting the exploits of maverick explorer Charles Muntz who heads back to South America to redeem himself after a giant bird skeleton he presents in the U.S. is denounced as a fraud. Not long after comes an exquisite interlude that in less than five minutes encapsulates the life-long love affair between Carl Fredericksen and his wife Ellie in a manner worthy of even the most poetic of silent-film directors. The two were brought together by their mutual enthusiasm for Muntz and it remained Ellies lifelong dream to emulate the adventurer and travel to Paradise Falls in South America. But life has other plans and Ellie must settle for a happy life with balloon-seller Carl (voiced by Ed Asner). When she dies she leaves behind a scrapbook as well as a very grumpy widower who retreats into self-enforced exile. With heavy-rimmed black glasses thick white hair and eyebrows bulbous nose square jaw and a scrunched body that looks like its been through a compactor old Carl resembles a cross between Spencer Tracy and Walter Matthau at the ends of their careers. He wants no company content to live out his days in the house he shared with Ellie which becomes surrounded by giant construction projects. Finally faced with eviction Carl concocts a plan. In a surprising and brilliantly visual sequence thousands of colored balloons hatch from behind the house prying it from its foundation and carrying it skyward; Carl intends to fly it to South America fulfilling Ellies dream. However hes got an unplanned passenger in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai) a roly-poly eager-beaver Junior Wilderness Explorer whos previously tried to enlist the old goats help to win him a badge. The trip goes uneventfully -- no time wasted on navigational challenges -- the better to quickly achieve the destination. The arrival is stunningly portrayed with thick fog clearing to reveal bizarre rock formations atop a mesa adjacent to the falls (designs were inspired by Angel Falls the worlds highest and the actual tepui mountains around the juncture of Venezuela Brazil and Guyana -- the location of Arthur Conan Doyles ""The Lost World""). Carl and Russell quickly come upon the very sort of rare bird Muntz went back to find decades before a brilliantly plumed gawky 13-footer they name Kevin. Kevins antics throughout are so humorous and beautifully animated they would be at home in a ""Looney Tunes"" highlights reel as would a breed of attack dogs commanded by Muntz himself (Christopher Plummer) who sends the canines in search of the elusive bird. At just 89 minutes ""Up"" is unusually short for a Pixar film and the action climax comes on rapidly. One setpiece features the two old-timers Carl and the swashbuckling Muntz going mano a mano aboard the latters spectacular zeppelin-like flying ship and numerous vertigo-producing shots show characters clinging for dear life. Although the cliffhanger effects are augmented by 3-D projection never do Docter (""Monsters Inc."") and co-director Bob Peterson shove anything in the viewers face just because of its 3-D potential. In fact the films overall loveliness presents a conceivable argument in favor of seeing it in 2-D Even with the strongest possible projector bulbs the 3-D glasses reduce the images brightness by 20%. At the very least the incentive for seeing ""Up"" in 3-D would seem less powerful than it is for other films. Despite the sheer volume of incident and action required of any film that includes young kids as a major portion of its target audience ""Up"" is an exceptionally refined picture; unlike so many animated films its not all about sensory bombardment and volume. As Pixars process is increasingly analyzed the more one appreciates the care that goes into the writing. The underlying carpentry here is so strong it seems it would be hard to go too far wrong in the execution. Unsurprisingly no one puts a foot wrong here. Vocal performances most importantly from Asner Plummer and nonpro Nagai exude a warm enthusiasm and tech specifications could not be better. Michael Giacchinos full-bodied traditional score is superlative developing beautiful themes as it sweeps the action along on emotional waves.
