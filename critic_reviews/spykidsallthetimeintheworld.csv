Even without such olfactory obnoxiousness writer/director Robert Rodriguezs fourth entry in his kiddie franchise is like its predecessors a tediously cartoonish candy-colored rollercoaster. Rebooting the action-comedy series via a ""next generation"" tale the film finds fresh heroes in Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook) who are called into secret-agent duty against the evil Timekeeper after learning that their stepmom (Jessica Alba) is actually a super-spy. Wielding wild gizmos and accompanied by their talking robotic dog (voiced by Ricky Gervais) the young duo navigate madcap videogame-esque hijinks defined primarily by cheesy CG effects and copious poop jokes from Alba dispatching a villain with a dirty diaper to the robo-pup dropping doo-doo bombs. A message about cherishing time with loved ones is as tacked on as its performances are broad (especially Jeremy Piven in multiple funny-voiced roles). Between its lame slapstick and bevy of odors that potently recall New Jersey Turnpike factory chemicals this Spy Kids manages to both figuratively and literally stink.

Elizabeth Weitzman Saturday August 20 2011 812 PM Title Spy Kids All the Time in the World in 4D A spys stepkids are roped into the family business. With Jessica Alba Jeremy Piven. Director Robert Rodriguez. (129). PG crude humor action. At area theaters. A chaotic chintzy adventure that could have gone straight to DVD the fourth ""Spy Kids"" should only be seen when it really does feel like you have all the time in the world--a rainy weekend say or those final days before school when boredom grips the household.Dont be fooled either by the ""4D Aroma-Scope"" gimmick which is nothing more than some scratch amp; sniff paper that corresponds to certain points in the story.Unfortunately most of those points reflect various bodily functions which tells you all you need to know about the script.  When all else fails a diaper bomb is thrown our way.Literally since dedicated spy Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba) gets a new assignment soon after having a baby. Her goal is to make her family the number one priority which means taking the infant with her when she goes to stop a time-freezing villain (Jeremy Piven).Marissas stepkids (Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook) are initially left at home. But soon enough theyve infiltrated the agency headquarters where Marissas niece and nephew (Alex Vega and Daryl Sabara the original spy kids) offer guidance.Before long the whole familys involved in the case even the dog (voiced by Ricky Gervais). The only one stuck on the sidelines is Dad (Joel McHale) a failed spyhunter who has no idea what his wife actually does for a living.Rodriguezs once-delightful ""Spy Kids"" series has gotten progressively worse and though he injects a bit of humor into the script--Gervais gets all the good lines--he barely seems to be trying now. An endless series of scatological jokes saps the charm out of nearly every scene and theres little effort to create an interesting mystery at the movies center.The adults either sleepwalk through (Alba) or come off as weirdly frantic (Piven who does get credit for playing three parts). Cook is a down-to-earth presence but Blanchard is stuck with a whiny annoying role that makes her no fun to be around.While kids will appreciate the action dont expect much from the effects. The movie looks like it was made on a smaller budget than Rodriguezs debut the 7000 ""El Mariachi."" And the ""aroma-scope"" element is a complete bust. My scratch n sniff card smelled like nothing but cardboard--though given that half the odors were of the diaper bomb variety that was perfectly fine with me.

"Spy Kids All the Time in the World in 4D review - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Review Spy Kids All the Time in the World in 4D Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times With all the talk this summer of reboots and prequels is there a term for a tenuously related but basically the same sequel?In ""Spy Kids All the Time in the World in 4D"" Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook play a new sister-and-brother pair of young-uns initiated into a world of high-tech gadgetry and crime-fighting when they find out their stepmother (Jessica Alba) is a former secret agent. Not even her husband (Joel McHale) knows about her former occupation until she is redrafted into service to capture a pair of mad scientists known as the Timekeeper and Tick Tock (both played by Jeremy Piven) who are literally stealing time.Robert Rodriguezs previous ""Spy Kids"" film from way back in 2003 was instrumental in kicking off the recent resurgence in 3-D. (So if youre looking for someone to blame...) This time he adds ""Aroma-Scope"" a fourth dimension of smell. Yes audience members are given scratch-and-sniff cards while entering the theater (along with 3-D glasses for theaters so equipped) and as the film plays numbers periodically appear on screen signaling a smell. Rodriguez never gets too adventurous with the concept -- food and bodily functions are the staples -- and even seems to eventually give up on it throwing three of the eight smells into a single moment.There is something playful about seeing Alba in spy-style cat suit -- reminiscent of her early role on TVs ""Dark Angel"" -- with first a baby bump and later an infant strapped to her chest. The film is also peppered with wise reminders for kids to be accepting of step-parents and for parents to set aside work to make time for their kids.Rodriguez apparently believes the formula for kid-friendly filmmaking is to toss in some whizzing clanging something or other whenever the storytelling seems to sag in order to amuse the kids and wake a dozing parent. Even genuine juveniles may eventually tire of his reliance on poop and goop as a source of humor.While Rodriguez has achieved a level of self-sufficient self-sustainability with his Austin Texas production facilities that might make him the envy of many other onetime Sundance whiz-kids his level of freedom has often revealed the limits of his imagination. This fourth ""Spy Kids"" picture isnt so much bad as it is just boring lacking the buzz and brio of even some of the earlier entries in the series. It feels like someone is now just marking time.calendarlatimes.comSpy Kids All the Time in the World in 4DMPAA rating PG for mild action and rude humorRunning time 1 hour 29 minutesPlaying In general release Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Espionage and Intelligence Politics and Government Movies Entertainment Spy Kids All the Time in the World in 4D (movie) Crime Law and Justice Crime 24 Frames Past Present and Future Movies Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-spy-kids-20110822,0,4520936.story?track=rss",200,spykidsallthetimeintheworld5,spykidsallthetimeintheworld,latimes

Thats what I couldnt help thinking every time Jessica Alba -- lovely to look at utterly ordinary to watch -- appeared on screen in ""Spy Kids All the Time in the World in 4D."" The fall-off in sexiness soulfulness and wittiness from Ms. Gugino and Antonio Banderas the parents in the first three ""Spy Kids"" films to Ms. Alba and Joel McHale is whiplash steep.And thats just one of the ways this fourth ""Spy Kids"" installment written and directed as always by Robert Rodriguez comes up short. Visually dreary (dont bother paying the 3-D premium) lazily yet confusingly plotted dominated by jokes involving vomit and an endlessly flatulent baby ""All the Time in the World"" feels more like straight-to-DVD filler than a chapter in one of the last decades most entertaining and sophisticated family-film franchises.Ms. Alba -- so luscious in her superspy cat suit that some of the family scenes start to get a little uncomfortable -- plays Marissa an aunt of the original spy kids Carmen and Juni Cortez who are now adults. Looking forward to her retirement from the spy game (shes hugely pregnant when the film begins) Marissa joins forces with them to stop an evil mastermind from speeding up or stopping time (it isnt clear which). The next generation of young agents -- Marissas squabbling stepchildren and eventually her new baby -- alternately help and hinder.Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara return now in supporting roles as Carmen and Juni representing practically the only on-screen connection to the earlier films. (Danny Trejo has an amusing cameo moment as their Uncle Machete but key players like Alan Cumming Tony Shalhoub and Steve Buscemi are gone.) Mr. Vega and Mr. Sabara look stiff and stranded in their underwritten adult parts; the new kids Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook exhibit charm and spunk but dont have much more to work with.Jeremy Piven in several roles tries hard to generate some comic sparks. Most of the (mildly) funny lines go to Ricky Gervais as the voice of a talking cyberdog. Photo Jessica Alba in ""Spy Kids All the Time in the World in 4D."" Credit Rico Torres/Weinstein Company Mr. McHale plays the goofball husband who doesnt know that his wife is a spy; hes the host of a reality television show called ""Spy Hunter"" the joke being that as with ""Ghost Hunters"" theres nothing to hunt -- until it turns out that there is. Hes naturally funny but disappears for long stretches.Midway through the movie after the new set of siblings has been let in on their stepmothers big secret Ms. Vega leads them into a room where the artifacts of the original spy kids program -- shut down seven years ago because of budget problems she says -- are stored. In the room are what appear to be models and sets from ""Spy Kids"" 1 through 3 a bit of a self-homage by Mr. Rodriguez that invokes a dangerous nostalgia for the giddy Indiana-Jones-inside-a-toy-box spirit of those earlier films. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In fact the eventual message of ""All the Time in the World"" -- summed up by the quickly reformed time-manipulating villain as ""You have to live life moving forward not back"" -- could be taken as a rueful comment on the folly of trying after eight years to recapture the magic of three films made in a compressed three-year span with a consistent (and wildly talented) cast. Unless of course youre just trying to milk a few more dollars out of the title.

(Rico Torres) C- Spy Kids All the Time in the World Genre Comedy Action/Adventure; Starring Jessica Alba Joel McHale Jeremy Piven; Director Robert Rodriguez; Author Robert Rodriguez; Release Date Wide 08/19/2011; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Dimension Films Posted August 21 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT The fourth installment of Robert Rodriguezs franchise that keeps adding dimensions even as it loses charm would have been better titled Spy Kids All the Time Puns in the World. Im not sure how much the target audience of youngsters appreciates Spy Kids All the Time in the World in 4Ds never-ending stream of ""Im gonna clean your clock"" and ""Dont waste my time"" wordplay but the filmmaker is clearly hoping the answer is a whole lot. Beyond that the film -- featuring a whole new set of crime-fighting progeny who discover that their stepmother (Jessica Alba) lives a secret life of gadgetry and car chases -- is mainly a collection of fart jokes backgrounds green-screened into abstraction and the same ""family first"" lessons espoused by the first three films. The hokiest element of all Rodriguezs resurrection of the scratch-and-sniff companion card last used years ago in a slightly more ironic fashion by John Waters could have been a fun addition if all the ostensible scents (bacon blue cheese dog flatulence) didnt just smell like a blueberry Yankee Candle.

Ask Movie Mom Click here Trailer Ace the Case with Susan Sarandon Posted by Nell Minow 10-year old Olivia and her 17-year old brother are left home alone when their Mom goes on a business trip for the weekend. Olivia sees a young woman being kidnapped on the empty New York City streets. Her brother doesnt believe her and neither do the cops. So Olivia starts investigating on her own trying to persuade a cynical detective (Susan Sarandon) that she is telling the truth.

If we dont know where we are there may be jokes but it is not truly comedy. Writer/directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore are not people with a lot of ideas. Their ""21 and Over"" was pretty much the same movie as their ""Hangover."" And the big innovation here is that this time its girls-gone-wild instead of boys. But it plays like it was inspired by a couple of womens magazine articles about the impossibility of ""having it all."" The movie says it comes down on the side of not judging other mothers those who seem to be losing it and those who seem to be holding it together. The message is that its good to forgive yourself for not being able to be perfect all the time. And its important to understand that loving your children means letting them learn to be responsible and not doing everything for them. But those good thoughts are undercut by the unexpectedly sour triumph of the main characters with antagonists who must be shown as spineless or pitiful. The reality of womens lives is a target-rich environment for comedy and the reality of mothers lives is especially so. But this script is so lazy that it does not meet the level of basic cable sitcoms for originality and wit. They have more in 22 minutes than ""Bad Moms"" does in 101. This is a movie that is supposed to be about female empowerment. There are two specific instances that involve women telling their cartoonishly awful husbands that they need to take more responsibility for their children and their households. And yet this is a movie that consistently shows the PTA as apparently entirely made up of women with the exception of one man who is shown at a PTA meeting specifically so he can be humiliated in public by his wife. Funny. amiright? And this is a school that apparently includes elementary middle and possibly high school students does not notice when a mother does a childs homework and has a pot-smoking principal who cant stand up to the President of the PTA. What? ""Hangover"" worked because most of the movie was about dealing with the horrible consequences of a major sort-of-accidental bender. ""Bad Moms"" tries to persuade us that a bender and attendant irresponsible behavior are signs of liberation. The bender is a mild one no tigers or tooth extractions. On the other hand the issue of money is raised but in the kind of fairy tale way that suggests no one connected with the movie has had to think about how to pay for groceries -- or damage inflicted on a grocery store -- in a very long time. Were supposed to believe them when they talk about how much they love their kids and would do anything for them but they dont really seem to enjoy or support them. And newsflash -- jokes about foreskins butt stuff and girl-on-girl kisses as a sign of rebellion and edginess are so 1998. The one-dimensional characters are as follows Mila Kunis plays Amy the exhausted mom of two who boots out her childish cheating husband. Shes had no sex in years. Kristen Bell is Kiki the exhausted mom of four whose husband treats her like Cinderella. They have sex once a week (""After ""Blue Bloods"") but he is not very uh excited or exciting. And Kathryn Hahn is Carla the happy unreliable slut who does not even know what a standardized test is much less whether her son has to take and pass them. She talks about sex all the time but does not seem to be having any either. Christina Applegate is Gwendolyn the Mean Girl (with henchmen played by Jada Pinkett-Smith and ""Bridesmaids"" co-writer Annie Mumolo (who should have done a major rewrite here). One thing Lucas and Moore get right is the combination of the humblebrag and the insult-wrapped in a compliment handed out by the ladies who run the school. Yes when they flutter their eyelashes and say ""I dont know how you do it"" to Amy she understands that they mean ""Youre doing it badly."" And there is a lot to be said about impossible standards and judgey people especially when it comes to parenting. But that requires actually saying something not just pointing it out. Amy blows her top decides not to try to be everything to everyone any more and then when Gwendolyn lashes back involving Amys daughter (in the Bizarro world of this movie the head of the PTA is in charge of everything in the school) Amy decides to run against her on a platform similar to but less authentic than that of Tammy in ""Election."" Even in a PTA election someone has to propose something more than ""lets do less and not judge each other."" All four women are brilliant actors and comedians and make as much of this material as they can but they all deserve much better. Jay Hernandez transcends the thankless role of the hot guy making him the only male in the film who is not completely infantilized. Someone needs to put him in a leading man role. And someone needs to start putting women in the leading role of writing and directing stories about women or at least men who can do better than this. NOTE The highlight of the movie is the series of conversations over the credits with the actresses and their real-life mothers filled with exactly the wit and heart missing from most of the film. Parents should know that this film is crude and explicit language throughout including very strong and crude language drinking drugs sexual references and explicit nudity and comic peril and violence. Family discussion Who is responsible for the standard the moms felt they had to live up to? How would this be different if it was about dads?

During the boring parts of this movie I played a game I made up that I called ""Same or Different."" For example in one of the earlier Bourne movies our hero the once-amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) grabbed a limited-use anonymous cell phone for a particularly clever maneuver. In this one he grabs a small tracking device handily left out in a bowl like peanuts at a bar for happy hour. Same or different? Different because the first one was plausible and this one was ridiculous. The earlier films had exceptionally well-staged fight scenes that felt like real people who get out of breath and hurt each other and jockey for advantage. In the first moments of this film in addition to completely unnecessary jumps between five different locations around the world for no purpose he knocks out an enormous professional fighter with one punch. Same or different? Same answer as above.  And if we distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys by how much collateral damage they inflict on the world -- how many innocent bystanders get killed the answer here is more same than different. There are franchise films made for fan service and then there are those that do not even service the fans are merely a cash grab and retroactively devalue the franchise. This is a movie that asks us to believe that the head of the CIA and a Mark Zuckerberg-young titan of the worlds coolest social media company a sort of cross between Google and Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat decide to have a conversation of the utmost secrecy in a posh Washington DC restaurant the kind where everyone eavesdrops on the big shots at the next table especially reporters politicians and Hill staffers. The first three Bourne films transcended the action/spy genre with a gritty almost intimate feel far from the glossiness of James Bond and with an expanding deepening storyline that as the then-LA Times critic Manohla Dargis said began with the existential in ""Identity"" (Who am I?) extended to the moral in ""Supremacy"" (What did I do?). With the third film the question of culpability extended to the larger ""I"" of the government Who are we and what have we done? We will put aside for the moment the non-Bourne ""Bourne"" which mistakenly went in the direction of a secret government program that was more ""Captain America"" than Bourne with a mysterious ability-enhancing drug that removed the somber reality that resonated with the era of waterboarding and Abu Ghraib. There is plenty to explore and attempt to expiate now and the movie tries to touch on contemporary issues explored in far more compelling -- and terrifying -- terms in documentaries like Alex Gibneys ""We Steal Secrets"" and ""Zero Days."" It just doesnt do anything interesting with them while it is piling improbable motivations and preposterous situations almost as high as the carnage and wrecked cars. Parents should know that this film has constant spy-related action-style peril and violence many characters injured and killed including many innocent bystanders themes of government corruption and some strong language. Family discussion Who should decide the balance between privacy and security and how much information about those decisions should be public? What real-life events inspired this story?

Maybe I got a dud card but I definitely got a dud movie to go with it. Nobody expected subtlety from a movie that comes with its own baby-fart smells but Robert Rodriguez clobbers home his messages about family and quality time with such bludgeoning force that ushers should hand you a helmet to go with your 3-D glasses. Im a fan of most of Rodriguezs silly energetic kids movies (from the original ""Spy Kids"" 10 years ago to the underrated ""Shorts"") but this time he grinds the wacky action and the juvenile and anarchic sight gags to a halt every time he wants to deliver another homily about siblings getting along or parents spending more time with their kids. He needs to get that cookbook that shows you to hide broccoli in your childrens mac and cheese. The film opens with extremely pregnant secret agent Marissa (Jessica Alba) chasing down the mysterious Tick Tock a criminal who uses ""time bombs"" to freeze his would-be captors in their tracks while he eludes them. After she captures him -- and her water breaks -- Marissa leaves the spy game behind to become a full-time mom. One year later we see her saddled not only with a food-flinging infant but also with twin stepkids Cecil (Mason Cook) doesnt make waves while his sister Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) misses their late mother and resents Marissas presence in their lives. Dad Wilbur (Joel McHale) spends most of his time thinking about his ""Spy Hunter"" TV show despite the fact that hes never found one -- and not knowing that hes living with an actual veteran of global espionage. A villain called the Time Master threatens to speed time ahead to the end of the world so Marissa is called back into action. Through a series of complications Cecil and Rebecca wind up on the case as well -- aided by their robot dog Argonaut (voiced by Ricky Gervais who provides most of the laughs) -- and now-grown onetime Spy Kid Carmen Cortez (Alexa Vega) shows them the ropes even though shes still nursing a grudge against her fellow operative and little brother Juni (Daryl Sabara). Longtime fans of the ""Spy Kids"" series will enjoy the many nods to past adventures and this reboot sets us up with a new pair of pint-sized agents. (Rebecca winds up being quick on her feet once she stops being such a brat and Cecil uses his hearing aids to his advantage cranking up the volume until he has the ears of a safe-cracker.) But the tone of ""Spy Kids 4D All the Time in the World"" -- which borrows its subtitle from the theme song to the 007 adventure ""On Her Majestys Secret Service"" -- is all over the place Alba (who seems to do her best work for Rodriguez) and Jeremy Piven (as Marissas boss) play the comedy very archly with tongue firmly in cheek. Which is fine except that McHales trademark deadpan doesnt mesh with the rest of the film at all. Its a clash that pales only to the mix of booger jokes and heartfelt pleas for family togetherness. And then theres the whole ""Aroma-Scope"" gimmick -- I missed the early-60s phenomena of Glorious Smell-o-Vision and AromaRama but when I saw John Waters ""Polyester"" in Odorama the old shoes and passed gas stickers didnt smell like the air-freshener one. When a poopy diaper smells like candy its time to go back to the drawing board and pretty much everything about ""Spy Kids 4D"" demands a do-over before we get a fifth installment.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its hard to believe its been eight years since the last Spy Kids adventure 2003s Spy Kids 3-D Game Over. In that respect director Robert Rodriguez is a victim of his success. Between subsequent Hollywood attempts to create a new kiddie super-spy franchise (see Agent Cody Banks) and Spy Kids-style kids films from Rodriguez like The Adventures Of Shark Boy And Lavagirl and Shorts pint-sized special agents have been only slightly less ubiquitous on the big screen than their adult counterparts. How are we supposed to miss the Spy Kids franchise when it feels like it never went away? In the belated fourth entry in the Spy Kids series the perpetually miscast Jessica Alba stars as a pregnant secret agent so dedicated she dodges bad guys and pursues evildoers even after shes started to go into labor. Albas stepchildren (Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook) know nothing of Albas secret life saving the world nor does husband Joel McHale a professional spy-catcher so clueless he cant detect the spies inside his own home. But when a time-obsessed madman known only as The Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven) begins robbing mankind of its time Blanchard and Cook are pressed into service as Spy Kids under the direction of original Spy Kid Alexa Vega now a top operative within her organization. Ricky Gervais continues his sad descent into glum self-parody voicing a Poochie-style talking robot dog with tude. The Spy Kids series once seemed charmingly homemade. These days it feels less charmingly homemade than maddeningly amateurish. The franchise similarly used to offer at least something for adults but if Spy Kids All The Time In The World aimed any younger in its puerile scatological humor and monosyllabic dialogue it would be pandering hard to the pre-natal demographic. With its shiny colors super-campy action and villain who cant stop making terrible puns relating to his identity Spy Kids All The Time In The World provokes traumatic memories of another third sequel from a franchise that had similarly worn out its welcome ages before it stopped Batman amp; Robin. Schumachers infamous botch at least induced morbid fascination; this is just leaden kitsch clumsily conceived and painfully executed.

Boasting a new cast and a new theatrical gimmick if little else ""Spy Kids All the Time in the World in 4D"" is a cheap-looking vaguely depressing echo of Robert Rodriguezs well-loved kidpic trilogy assembled with minimal imagination or effort. The ""Spy Kids"" name should still carry decent B.O. drawing power and very young viewers should be reasonably pacified by this briskly paced nonsense yet its hard to reckon why Rodriguez bothered to so half-heartedly revisit a franchise that was respectfully and effectively mothballed eight years ago. After having helped prove the viability of 3D family films with 2003s 111 million-grossing ""Spy Kids 3D Game Over"" Rodriguez has now set his sights on a somewhat later exploitation ploy of yore presenting ""All the Time in the World"" in Aroma-Scope; screenings come equipped with scratch-and-sniff cards featuring eight scents to be inspired upon onscreen cues (which tend to occur during scenes of either candy-eating or farting). Midnight screening reviewed featured neither the aroma cards nor the 3D though the deluxe version can be recommended sight unseen At least then the frequent onscreen interruptions and slo-mo shots of Cheetos falling toward the camera might be interestingly distracting rather than irritatingly so. Pic opens promisingly enough with hugely pregnant new super-spy Marissa (Jessica Alba) giving chase to new supervillain the Time Keeper (Jeremy Piven who also plays Marissas jive-talking boss) despite the onset of labor pains.  After apprehending the chipmunk-voiced hooligan Marissa is wheeled into the delivery room past her husband Wilbur (Joel McHale) and stepkids Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook) who all believe her to be nothing more than an unusually busy interior decorator. Flash forward to a year later and Marissa is retired from espionage looking after her flatulent baby as well as the snarky older twosome. Marissa is soon called back into action when the apparently back-at-large Time Keeper conspires to speed up the passing of time in order to hasten the apocalypse. Rebecca and Cecil are soon thereafter initiated into the OSS network aided by a talking robot dog (voiced by Ricky Gervais on autopilot and animated in the style of ""Look Whos Talking"") and original Spy Kid Carmen Cortez (the now strikingly beautiful Alexa Vega). The films various action setpieces simply come and go without much in the way of mounting tension or coherent throughlines to connect them and tend to decrease rapidly in quality and ambition as things progress. Most unwelcomely more than two of these fight and chase scenes involve poop and vomit used as weaponry which smacks of desperation in a series that had heretofore steered clear of that. The plentiful bathroom humor aside Rodriguez can at least be commended for continuing to helm kidpics that wont trouble his target audience; given the lack of suspense or seriousness nothing here will be remotely frightening for children though some parents may object to the employment of ""shiitake"" as an expletive. Both new leads acquit themselves just fine for feature-film newcomers while Alba recites her lines with barely the slightest exertion and Piven struggles mightily with some nearly undeliverable comicbook banter. (The subtitle of the film is spoken at least six times and the ceaseless time-related puns go from tiresome to admirably over-the-top and back again.) McHale is clearly having the most fun as the broods clueless father though his subplot as a reality TV spy-hunter is pointlessly under-developed. Visual effects range from passable to pitiful and the film has the overall look of a direct-to-video quickie.

TWITTER Jessica Alba Joel McHale and Alexa Vega star in the fourth installment of the series. Life is too short for Spy Kids All the Time in the World in 4D. The ability of the storys villain to speed up time the better to hurry the day until Armageddon merely makes you wish you had access to fast-forward button to shorten the misery just as the countless fart jokes and dismal fourth-dimensional Aroma-Scope (the same scratch-and-sniff card used by John Waters for Polyester 20 years ago) create an intense desire to get out into the fresh air without delay. Arriving eight years after the lame third installment in Dimensions profitable series this seems like far too little way too late. Decorously but absurdly encapsulating the contemporary notion of the working mom bulgingly pregnant secret agent Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba) uses a zip line and engages some enemy goons in a martial arts contest just before checking into a hospital to give birth. A year later the villainous Time Keeper (whose face is an old-fashioned mantle clock) is a tick away from stealing time from the rest of the world. So with Marissa sidelined with her gaseous little tot her tiresome stepchildren (Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook) in the company of a chatty dog (voiced by Ricky Gervais at his least amusing) jump into the breach to do battle with the time bandits helium-voiced henchman against a backdrop of cheap-looking visual effects which are often dominated by giant turning clock gears in this digital age. The incessant banter spewing from the mouths of the two child leads is both puerile and dull with writer-director Robert Rodriguez seemingly far more interested in airing banal views about how busy parents and kids could arrange to spend more quality time together than in creating anything resembling a coherent plot or suspense. Once upon a time a promising filmmaker Rodriguez still works frequently but to ever-diminishing returns exhibiting laziness as a writer and slap-dash tendencies as a director. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara who played the title characters in the first three franchise entries 2001-3 are back but all grown up now playing secondary agents for the spy outfit OSS. Jeremy Piven essays the head of the organization as well as two other roles but he like all the others here is just marking time and cashing the checks. Everyones time that of the filmmakers as well as the audience is worth more than this. Dimension chose not to press-screen the picture and all of three people were present for the 1201 a.m. show caught.
