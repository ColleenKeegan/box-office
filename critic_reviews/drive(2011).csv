But while the original noir directors went to great lengths to mask the sunlit beauty of their surroundings from the late 60s another set of filmmakers took the staple elements of the genre - brooding heroes gun-crazy villains desperate dames - and brought them out into the light making noir simultaneously more glossy more vivid and paradoxically a whole lot colder.The truly great LA noir movies - Point Blank The Driver Straight Time To Live and Die in LA Heat - share common characteristics beyond the basic cliches of the crime genre. These are movies informed by the city in which they were made a city constructed of gleaming surfaces - six-lane highways vast industrial wastelands and endless suburban sprawl - and a place where crime is grubby and small-time carried out by empty hopeless loners in hock to dapper despots with unpredictable personalities.Its in this world that we find the near-silent hero of Drive Nicolas Winding Refns self-consciously slick synth-scored throwback. Ryan Gosling plays the unnamed Driver a mechanic and occasional getaway guy whose life is overturned when he meets Irene (Carey Mulligan) a struggling mum with a husband in the joint. As all the above implies this is a film built on familiarity in terms of narrative and style neon lights flash rubber tyres screech Gosling broods Mulligan swoons and a trio of wisecracking overdressed character actors - Albert Brooks Ron Perlman and Bryan Cranston - provide both levity and dramatic weight. But Drive never drags this is an entirely welcome riff on old material a pulse-pounding electronically enhanced cover version of a beloved standard. Sure its shallow but its also slickly compelling beautifully crafted and so damn shiny.

It promises car chase action but never delivers. Gosling is dull a pretty vacant character. The mobs are cliche. The love story is too chaste. Its certainly stylish but very shallow with its story and emotion. Through most of the film it reminded me of a video games chapter clip like in GTA Liberty City.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 5 2012LoulouFeaturedBrilliantly engaging - a mood is created which certainly drew me in. Love the 80s feel. I was shocked by the violent bits mainly because they were so out of the blue but really no worse than what Tarantino comes up with (of whom I am a fan) I thought Ryan was impressive if laconic.

Enjoyed it just as much as first time. I really like the photography in this film - some of the nighttime aerial shots are superb. The opening soundtrack is brilliant - Kavinskys ""Nightcall"" (its on YouTube). The script is good and often the absense of any soundtrack works very well with the unusually quiet character Gosling plays.

I wouldnt normally venture to a film about bank heists and car chases. The storys pretty good but its Goslings acting and the excellent photography that make it really worth seeing.

Also please can you alter the CSS for this comment box as the text is way too small this is 2011 not the 90s. Anyway - to the film at hand. Drive is a flawed film but packs one hell of a punch. Whilst the cinematography settings music and tone provide a wonderful norish atmosphere to absorb yourself in there are too many longeurs which differentiates Drive from the tautness of similar Mann fare. However there are moments of genuis - notably some of the incredibly loud sound design of gunfire and also the extreme violence which makes for a shocking experience in parts. Perhaps its all too much style for some but I found Drive sometimes exhilarating often shocking and sometimes so violent I laughed out loud.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 28 2011BoredfilmgoerFeaturedI saw a preview of this and fell asleep Its boring and horribly violent. I think the director likes Carey Mulligans little nose. Im sick of seeing tears spill out of her eyes - has she done this in every film Ive seen her in?

By Anthony Lane Ryan Gosling in a new movie directed by Nicolas Winding Refn.   Credit Illustration by TES ONE The hero of ""Drive"" (Ryan Gosling) is unnamed from start to finish. That fact alone puts him in distinguished company with the Preacher in ""Pale Rider"" (1985) for instance played by Clint Eastwood who had already enshrined the Man with No Name in three al-dente Westerns. The first of them ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964) was the direct offspring of Akira Kurosawas ""Yojimbo"" which in turn was a first cousin once removed of Dashiell Hammetts ""Red Harvest"" a novel whose protagonist with a heart like a corn husk was known only as the Continental Op. And so this mini-band of brothers--unsmiling unidentified but all too recognizable--continues to grow. To qualify you need only do a clean and thorough job whatever the smuts of a dirty world. If you have to break heads do it in a good cause. And above all whether youre in charge of a horse or an Impala ride hard. The first car that is assigned to our guy in ""Drive"" is indeed a Chevy Impala in numbing silver-gray. ""No one will be looking at you"" he is told and thats the point. Though tuned and buffed under the hood the Chevy remains a heroically dull machine perhaps the least memorable chase weapon since Roy Scheider clambered into a Pontiac Ventura the color of a very tired squirrel in ""The Seven-Ups"" (1973). That model was even glummer than the Pontiac LeMans--who was kidding whom with that name?--in which Gene Hackman raced against an Elevated train two years earlier in ""The French Connection""; and both of course were nothing beside the gleaming flanks of the Mustang used in ""Bullitt"" (1968). If you want to be seen like Steve McQueen you sport your car as if it were a suit tailor made to your skills. If you want to fade into the background though like the fellow in ""Drive"" you get something you can steal and leave behind. The Driver--we have to call him something I guess--lives in L.A. where he moonlights as a getaway man. Not that theres much of a moon. The director Nicolas Winding Refn prefers the glow of neon stop signs and the pools of light that leak through a garage. It takes a while to learn what the Driver does in sunshine and the discovery feeds the smartest scene in the movie. The day after he and the Impala ferry a pair of thieves away from a warehouse robbery we find him walking along in police uniform. Great twist we think a cop who helps robbers after hours. But then just as were digesting that news he gets into a police vehicle guns it and crashes it with a camera crew looking on. Hes not a cop after all but a stunt driver playing a cop doubling for an actor who cant be risked in a smash. To sum up in the space of a few minutes our take on this man has flipped and rolled over twice and nothing is quite what it seems. Anyone seeing the title of the movie and hoping for a pedal-stomping update on ""Convoy"" or ""Smokey and the Bandit"" will by now be feeling a mite confused. Naturally the Driver lives alone. Down the hall is the apartment of Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos). The Driver meets her and against regulations falls in love; at any rate he cracks a smile and twitches the toothpick that sits at the side of his mouth so something must be stirring in his soul. The boys father Standard (Oscar Isaac) is in jail and when he comes out the Driver far from showing hostility befriends him and offers assistance--a courtly old-fashioned gesture as though he lacked any better way of expressing his feelings for Irene. If Lancelot had lived next door to Guinevere he would have done the same. Standard needs dough to pay off prison debts which means taking part in a heist. The plan is that the Driver will chauffeur him to and from the job without letting Irene hear about it. Needless to say the plan backfires and both men fall prey to some unsavory specimens led by Bernie (Albert Brooks) with a glittering collection of knives and Nino (Ron Perlman) who looks like something out of ""The Descent of Man."" A surprisingly high fraction of ""Drive"" is indebted to ""The Driver"" Walter Hills whittled-down thriller of 1978. The two films share that first pursuit through a velvet-dark L.A.; the often wordless hero; a troublesome bag of cash; automobiles that dont simply whisk along but hide in corners like cats; and the spare bursts of music with Refn opting for an electronic underthrob at the start that nags like a migraine. Yet he also veers away from Hill in striking fashion ditching any notion of a cop as a suitable nemesis (""The Driver"" brought on Bruce Dern at his loopiest) and choosing for a heroine not the blank beauty of Isabelle Adjani who appeared to be molded from porcelain but the vulnerable sweetness of Carey Mulligan whose smile would cause many road users to lose their grip and cannon into a lamppost. Last nothing in Hills film is as entertaining as Bernies riff on his past career. In the nineteen-eighties it appears before launching into crime he produced movies. ""One critic called them European"" he recalls adding ""I thought they were shit."" Credit to Refn who is Danish for running that gag. All this is excellent news which makes it doubly wretched to report that having delighted in the doominess of ""Drive"" as its journey began I ended much less joyful than repelled. What happened? In short an explosion--not of a flaming car or a bombed building but of a head. (Whose head I will not reveal except to say that to damage such a performer whether with a slap or as here with a shotgun strikes me as a crime against nature.) Refn seems to have a thing about heads and about the hurt that they can suffer--capital punishment in the worst sense. We watch as the Driver stamps time and again on the skull of a villain in an elevator; but what exactly are we watching as the camera rests for a second on the mashed-up result? Prosthetics pixellation pastry dough? The people around me reacted with the eewrrgh sound that has become de rigueur in the viewing of violence followed by the traditional hasty giggle to pop the tension; even those moviegoers who revel in such a sight however might usefully pause to inspect the kick of pleasure that it provokes. No doubt they will have seen much worse and they will also know that a bursting brain is no more real than a game of Quidditch yet what perturbs me about a film as careful and as intelligent as ""Drive"" is its manifest delusion that in refusing to look away from the minutiae of nastiness it is actually drawing us closer to the truth about pain. This is not so. When James Stewart was deliberately shot in the hand from close range in ""The Man from Laramie"" (1955) we did not witness the bullet enter his flesh nor did we need to. The director Anthony Mann knew that his proper focus moral as well as physical should be on Stewarts face which turned into a writhing map of outrage agony and shame--a peculiar emasculated shame as befitted a cowboy who lived by the sweat of his hands. Compare the sequence in ""Drive"" in which Albert Brooks shakes a mans hand and holding tight slices through the veins in his wrist. Brooks--the most prominent presence in the movie caustically cast against type--tells his victim not to worry. ""Its over its over"" he says and the pitiless soothing of his voice as the mans lifeblood ebbs away is unforgettable but its difficult to concentrate because Refn is far too concerned to show the fountain of that blood and its ridiculous leap. In grabbing our attention he diverts it from what matters. The horror lingers and seeps; the feelings are sponged away. That is true of ""Drive"" as a whole. Ryan Gosling is a touch too sympathetic for the freeze-dried laconic Driver whom we follow in the first half and once the mood is fractured and he starts to dish out bestial beatings that stillness is badly devalued. He becomes ever harder to believe in however fervent he is meant to be in defending the helpless Irene and the suspicion arises that he might be not so much a rounded character as a card in a game of style. Even his clothes make scant dramatic sense. He wears a quilted silver jacket with a gold scorpion embroidered on the back and keeps on wearing it when the fabric is smeared with gore but why would a man so clearly defined elsewhere by the spirit of self-effacement take such a risk? It must be because Refn rather than his hero admires the kitschy shine of the garment and the way that--like the savagery the speed and all the foul mouths--it folds into his vision of the city. There is no shortage of pulse and finesse in that vision; ""Drive"" marks the first occasion on which Refn has shot a film in America and like countless outsiders before him he casts an eye that is at once entranced and stunned. By his own admission though he doesnt have a license and it shows. The man behind ""Drive"" cant drive.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Allow me to back up If you watch a lot of films youll see good ones and bad ones some of them exceptional in one direction or the other. But whatever genre they might inhabit--action flick historical drama romantic comedy--they tend to line up along one relatively familiar spectrum or another. The stylistic elements are familiar and yet they are assembled into something fresh vital and astonishingly intense Now and then though you see a film that jumps off the spectrum altogether one that reminds you that novel possibilities exist even within the most well-worn cinematic conventions. In the most extreme cases--Annie Hall say or Star Wars or Pulp Fiction--such a movie possesses enough gravity to realign the spectrum altogether. And while Drive the stunning Hollywood debut of Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn is unlikely to have such an impact (it is a triumph of execution more than formula) it is nonetheless a minor revelation. The narrative and stylistic elements of Refns film are familiar--indeed it is awash in echoes and allusions--yet they are assembled into something fresh and vital and astonishingly intense. Ryan Gosling stars as a movie stunt driver who moonlights as a by-appointment-only wheelman for crooks who lack their own wheels. (Think of him as the Zipcar of getaway drivers.) His mentor in endeavors both licit and illicit is Shannon (Bryan Cranston) a hard-luck garage owner who imagines that his fortunes might still take a turn for the better. Goslings character known only as ""the driver"" meets and takes a quiet interest in Irene (Carey Mulligan) a pretty apartment-building neighbor who lives with her son while she waits for her husband (Oscar Isaac) to finish out a prison sentence. Rounding out the principal cast are Albert Brooks (in a notably unBrooksian role) Mad Mens Cristina Hendricks and the ambulatory Easter Island head known as Ron Perlman.

Going into the film I knew very little of what was to take place and I wouldnt have had it any other way. Suffice it to say that the movie is an homage to old car-cult B-movies such as Bullitt and The Driver and that it starts slowly before accelerating to harrowing velocity. The first half has a bit of the moody music-video feel of Hong Kongs Wong Kar-Wai; the latter half the shocking visceral ferocity of Koreas Park Chan-Wook. The extreme and escalating violence will prove off-putting to some--frankly Im surprised not to have been among them--but for the rest Drive is a needle-punch of adrenaline to the aorta. The films elegant cinematography is by Newton Thomas Sigel Bryan Singers usual collaborator and the script is adapted by Hossein Amini from the James Sallis novel. The cast is uniformly strong--in particular Gosling whose lithe wary presence suits the iconic aspirations of the role. But the true star of Drive is director Refn (the Pusher trilogy Bronson Vahalla Rising) who proves himself to be admirably dangerous at any speed. Scene after scene is suspended in exquisite tension by turns romantic and murderous--and in one notable instance both. It is a testament to Refns supple gifts that the same film in which Gosling and Mulligan trade sheepish grins amid awkward silences can subsequently rise to operatic malevolence and yet feel entirely of a piece. Among its many resonances Drive reminded me of Neil Jordans Mona Lisa another tale of a driver teetering between innocence and cruelty; of Sergio Leones Dollars trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West with their nameless laconic protagonists and meticulous buildups to spasms of sudden violence; of the original 1971 Get Carter and its intoxicating pitilessness; of Halloween in its use of--well youll see. It reminded me of late Cronenberg and early Scorsese of Michael Mann without the preening and Tarantino without the ADHD. Most of all though Drive reminded me of what it can be like--what it ought to be but so infrequently is like--to go out to the movies. I was buzzing when I left the theater. Im buzzing still.

Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

Ryan Gosling right gives his character Driver a ""just visiting this planet"" demeanor. Its averbally muted utterly embodied performance.

Thats hardly a commonplace mashup. But then ""Drive"" directed with cool confidence by Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn isnt easy to peg. Based on James Sallis 2005 small-press novel its a moody ride steered by a director with an uncanny sense of cinemas rhythms. A portrait of a laconic wheelman known as Driver its a high-performance vehicle for shrewd professionals from Gosling to vets Albert Brooks Bryan Cranston and Ron Perlman. The film begins funky -- and we mean in a good way. The opening credits arrive in a hot- pink cursive that evokes a ""what tha?"" And the soundtrack offers hints of the electronic pulse of 80s pop. When closed-mouthed Driver wheels through nighttime Los Angeles or interacts with garage owner Shannon (Cranston) the movie shows off its noir roots. When he starts to hanker for neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos) it stirs in a not-too- cloying syrup of romance. Driver is a man of very few words unless hes instructing a client on his five-minute rule Criminals have his fealty for that window. After that -- well. . . . His side job as a Hollywood stunt driver keeps his skill set whetted. Its a gig that also anchors ""Drive"" squarely in the realm of the Dream Factory. Refn who won the best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel maneuver the dreaminess of a late-afternoon date as easily as they accelerate through the nightmare of a daytime assault. Not since ""Collateral"" Michael Manns nocturnal tour of L.A. has that city been so well cruised. Driver is a hero in the underground world of the antihero. Sure the tentative dance between him and Irene is guy- meets-gal mechanic-courts- waitress. Only Drivers not merely a mechanic. And Irenes not free. Newly paroled husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) arrives to complicate matters with a triangle that is tender and tortured. ""Drive"" revisits the familiar precinct of honor and betrayal among thieves. Woefully bereft of the luck of the Irish Shannon still works the angles. He brings in Bernie (Brooks) as an investor in a stock car. His pitch Driver. Nino (Perl man) is Bernies nastier business-partner-in- crime. Theyll all overlap in ways that recall the snarky madness of ""Get Shorty"" before giving in to a bloodletting worthy of Tarantino although when ""Drive"" turns violent its never gleefully so. Gosling has done aching turns in a slew of idiosyncratic indies from ""Half Nelson"" about a public-school teacher with a drug addiction; to ""Lars and the Real Girl"" about a guy who courts a blow-up doll; to last years marital smashup ""Blue Valentine."" Here he gives his character a ""just visiting this planet"" demeanor. Its a verbally muted utterly embodied performance. Driver watches. Then he watches some more. When Irene and Benicio show up at the garage where he works a nearly imperceptible smile gives way to something felt. In reworking genres without quoting shamelessly Refn proves himself his own man and a guy quite capable of taking us places we didnt even know we wanted to go.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 16 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English By day hes a stunt driver for the movies; by night a getaway driver for crooks. Happily we begin on his night shift in the darkened streets of L.A with a masterful opening sequence that accomplishes the near-impossible Damned if it doesnt reinvent the car-chase cliche not by tramping on the accelerator but by stomping on the brake. This is no antic-frantic affair; instead its a cerebral game of stop-and-go hide-and-seek as the director behind the camera handles things exactly like the guy behind the wheel - with a stylish mixture of cold calculation and cool aplomb. Movies Drive The official trailer That director is Nicolas Winding Refn the Dane who established both his visual cred and his bloody-mindedness in the Pusher trilogy and Bronson. As for the wheelman his sole name is Driver which gives you an idea of where matters are heading - yep toward that gruesome point where high style collides with pulp content. Its a fun ride at least until the fun turns well funny - risibly so - but thats always a danger in this genre. Sometimes minus any warning our suspended disbelief just plummets with a laughable thud. Early on though weve got Ryan Gosling to marvel at anew. His understated brand of acting minimalist but magnetic is perfect for the role. The laconic Driver is meant to be a cipher who like the big-engine stock cars he admires hides his roaring beast within a conventional exterior. That sub-textual tension has us intrigued especially when he starts a polite flirtation with the pretty young mom (Carey Mulligan) living next door the one whose imprisoned husband is slated for release. Soon enough hubby appears and proves to be a hitherto loose cannon trying hard to tighten up a sincere effort undermined by the fact that hes deep in hock to a couple of unforgiving mobsters. His predicament kick-starts the plot which sees Driver contributing his automotive skills to a pawn-shop heist. Cue the double crosses the messy complications the accumulating pile of bodies shot to the head or stabbed in the heart or less elegantly reduced by vigorous stomping to grape-hued mush. To this stage Goslings blue-eyed stare Mulligans conflicted sweetness some splendidly creepy supporting work by Albert Brooks as the loquacious mob boss and Refns noir-in-colour panache have all combined to keep the dirty business humming smartly along. Oops then comes the collision when too much style gets vanquished by too little content. For example Drivers inner beast is sporadically present but never accounted for. In the absence of any motivation or back-story Gosling is left to play him with a simple on-off switch - nice guy one second grape-stomper the next (the laugh-out-loud moment). Refn counters by doing what visually talented directors always do in substantively bankrupt circumstances - cranking up the style-meter even higher fortifying the violence with lyrical slow-mo borrowed from Peckinpah or shadowy knife-fights copped from Welles. The result? Just more uninvited chuckles. Still lets be generous here. Drive is noirishly attractive until it stalls and inadvertently amusing after. In other words theres always something - this is a flick that does us right even when it goes wrong.

Theyll take you herky-jerky stop-start your ankles quick then smooth keeping you off-balance until you dont have any clue what speed is coming at you next. This is what Drive does and to its eternal credit what Drive is. The pace of this film is a beautiful thing to behold as Drive is a patient but taut thriller. Ryan Gosling is a driver. Hell give you five minutes of wheel time keep you safe delivering you to your destination with style. He wears driving gloves and has a stopwatch and hes very serious about his profession. The opening scenes of Drive show Gosling at his most precise evading the police after a warehouse heist. It should be noted that this isnt a car chase movie -- its far superior because its all about the technique (which ideally you wont sweat). After the heist the cops are on the hunt and Gosling has to do his thing. Driver (the film grants him no name) occasionally just stops driving all together letting the momentum of the authorities in pursuit carry them away from his clients. At other moments hes massively aggressive with his maneuvers and these are the moments of ratcheted risks and pained grimaces. Building building building the tension -- thats the goal of Drive and it delivers throughout until eventually youre willing buyer of whatever it wants to sell you. Enter Carey Mulligan as Drivers next-door neighbor. She like Driver carries some battle scars and they circle each other like tigers in a ring. The whole soundtrack is infused with a lovely 80s synth vibe at once futuristic and nostalgic. Sublimely executed. Problems do (naturally) ensue in the form of relationships gone awry on all sides. Drivers other job is as a mechanic and his boss has dreams of him racing professionally. Unfortunately to stake Drivers racing career he gets involved with some unsavory characters for an unsavory loan with massively untenable terms. This is where Albert Brooks (as Bernie Rose) enters the fray and hes never been better. Things arent too positive on the home front either as a shadowy figure from Mulligans past shows up at her door. Theres a child involved too if only so we can see the melting of Goslings icy facade for a few moments. Gosling for his part seems to mature as an actor minute by minute as the film plays out. Driver is a dangerous sort of man blustery cold with unpredictable moments of boil and Gosling plays it all like a Stradivarius which is to say he uses the very capable tool hes been given in a masterful manner. The only real knock on Drive is that its occasionally violent and there are those in our society who would prefer to avoid violence on film. Its a fair point but I loved Drive and I think you might too. Tense well-acted well-conceived and well-executed Drive is a pretty good example of what happens when exceptional skill meets opportunity.

He is a man without a past and not much of a future. His home is a nearly empty L.A. apartment. During the day he works as a mechanic or a stuntman doing car crashes. During the night hes the getaway guy for heists. ""What do you do?"" a new neighbor innocently asks him. ""I drive"" he says. Nameless nearly voiceless hes the enigma at the heart of ""Drive"" a crackling action picture thats one part hard-boiled noir one part existential drama. Of course theres often a fine line between philosophers and posers between the deeply serious and the just plain silly. And for most of its length ""Drive"" speeds along that edge. On two wheels. That it doesnt topple over into absurdity is to the credit of its actors and its director. Ryan Gosling plays the driver and he gives the character the kind of imperturbable silences that would have made Steve McQueen look like a motormouth. Yet despite the cliched taciturnity -- and an awful gaudy jacket he never takes off -- he never becomes a joke. And his stoicism is nicely contrasted with all the other performers in the fine cast which include the touchingly vulnerable Carey Mulligan as a woman he tries to rescue and Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks -- yes that Albert Brooks -- as a couple of ""connected"" guys. Its a smart combination of contrasts and keeping it all moving is the hugely talented Nicolas Winding Refn the Danish wunderkind who debuted with his three-part crime epic ""Pusher"" and most recently had the mad and bloody Viking tale ""Valhalla Rising."" Like his other films this one features gruesome explosions of violence (the worst of which occurs just out of frame). But it also shows a classic attention to detail with sturdy steady camerawork and editing that explains rather than obscures the action going on. Refns love of pulp archetypes and surprise casting choices may make you think of Tarantino. But his filmmaking -- with cars moving down the neon nightways of Los Angeles while synthesizers murmur in the background -- is closer to the slick crime films of Michael Mann. Its a lot to pull together and sometimes on a few of the hairpin turns Refn takes his hands off the wheel for a second and the film risks skidding into self-parody. (As much fun as Brooks and Perlman have playing them neither mobster is remotely convincing and the crime that takes up the last half of the film is a trifle far-fetched.) But for stone-cold retro action fans who are tired of all these over-edited underachieving thrillers -- well heres one car chase movie that isnt running on empty. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence nudity and strong language. Drive (R) Film District (100 min.) Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. With Ryan Gosling Carey Mulligan.

By night hes the getaway driver for heist operations. Starring Ryan Gosling Carey Mulligan Ron Perlman Christina Hendricks Bryan Cranston Director Nicolas Winding Refn Running time 140 Release Opened Sep 16 2011  Editorial Review Sophistication behind the wheelBy Ann HornadayFriday Sep 16 2011Star of the moment Ryan Gosling delivers a slow white-hot burn of a performance in ""Drive"" a nervy understated ode to one of Hollywoods most cherished archetypes the sad-eyed man of few words. They can be cowboys hit men or in this case loners who drive cars for a living. But no matter how chilly and reserved the mysteries at their core mesmerize rather than repel. As a getaway driver known only as Driver Gosling obviously harks back to similar protagonists played by Ryan ONeal Lee Marvin Robert De Niro and especially Steve McQueen. But in ""Drive"" Gosling and director Nicolas Winding Refn neatly manage the hat trick of paying homage to those wheelmen of yore while reinvigorating the genre with style smarts and flashes of wit. You may still want to fasten your seat belts but in these capable seductive hands youre in for a smooth uncommonly assured ride. Thats made clear in the opening sequence of ""Drive"" when Goslings character fetches two thieves from a Los Angeles warehouse. Found out by the police who begin to pursue them by way of patrol cars and a helicopter Driver leads the fuzz not on the wheel-screeching bombastic chase audience might expect but on a quiet cat-and-mouse prowl through Los Angeless nighttime back streets winding up in the endless proscenium arches of a parking garage. At once classic and refreshingly new the sequence establishes Drivers watchful calm and psychic mettle as well as Refns indisputable chops as a filmmaker with firm command of tone rhythm and irresistibly propulsive pacing. It turns out that Drivers getaway gig is just a sideline; his day job becomes clear in one of the all-time great movie ""reveals"" which makes ""Drive"" not just a fast-car action picture but a wry commentary on Hollywood artifice (which will come in handy later when someone covered in blood needs to blend in with a crowd). Carey Mulligan as Drivers new neighbor Irene may be completely miscast as the wife of a low-level criminal named Standard (the terrific Oscar Isaac) but her chemistry with Gosling is entirely believable not least because Refn chooses to convey it through lyrical sequences of shy glances and wordlessly eloquent gestures. Far more persuasive however improbably is Albert Brooks as Bernie Rose a seedy criminal middle-manager who like everyone in L.A. tried his hand in the biz in his case as a producer. ""One critic called them European"" he wistfully recalls of his movies. Later in one of the movies most chilling scenes he sweet-talks and soothes a hapless victim while he quietly slips a shiv in his arm effecting a flawless balance between nebbishness and menace. Refn a Danish director whose previous films include ""Bronson"" and ""Valhalla Rising"" is known for his love of blood and when the plot of ""Drive"" quickens he finds plenty of chances to indulge in his penchant for lurid stylized violence. But even his most fetishized flourishes are tempered here not just with the tender love story between Irene and Driver but with Refns newfound restraint (one pivotal murderous episode occurs entirely in shadow). After skillfully earning the audiences allegiance ""Drive"" which is based on the novel by James Sallis throws its heros motives into more troubling ambiguity with Goslings grievous angel proving to be capable of startling brutality. Like the scorpion on his jacket he cant escape his nature and Refn does a good job of keeping that core moral essence opaque until the explosive end. Hes also constructed a perfect showcase for Goslings hangdog charisma which has come into its own this year first with ""Crazy Stupid Love"" and next with ""The Ides of March."" A poster for the latter has his face morphing with George Clooneys and the comparison is apt; indeed ""Drive"" recalls two of Clooneys best and recent movies ""Michael Clayton"" and ""The American."" Like ""Michael Clayton"" ""Drive"" is a hushed methodical ode to competence a wistful wish-fulfillment fantasy in an age of mass screw-uppery. Like ""The American"" its almost abstract in its willingness to eschew conventional plotting and dialogue for a subtle sound design and crisp clean imagery. Most important like Clooneys best movies ""Drive"" features a compulsively watchable cipher at its center. Low-key sleek and sophisticated ""Drive"" provides the visceral pleasures of pulp without sacrificing art. Its cool and smart. Some critics might even call it European.Contains strong brutal bloody violence and some nudity.

Photo Albert Brooks shifts into high gear in ""Drive"" his best role in years ( ) Early reviews out of Cannes proclaimed Danish director Nicolas Winding Refns Hollywood debut ""Drive"" a full-blooded return to such 60s thrillers as ""Bullitt"" and ""Point Blank."" It isnt. Youll have more fun if you ignore the hype and enjoy this breezily violent genre exercise for what it is. Ryan Gosling one of our best young actors takes it relatively easy after the dramatic heavy lifting of ""Blue Valentine"" by playing a relative cipher of a Hollywood stunt driver -- known only as ""Driver"" -- who moonlights as a robbery wheelman in Los Angeles. Jobs in both areas are steered Drivers way by his agent (Bryan Cranston) whos also persuaded a movie producer (Albert Brooks in a career-changing role) to fund a racing car for his client. The rigorously professional Drivers cool begins to melt when he meets a neighbor (Carey Mulligan) a single mother with a young son (Kaden Leos). Romance is nipped in the bud -- at least temporarily -- when her husband (Oscar Isaac) is released from the slammer. By that point Drivers feelings for her are such that he unwisely agrees to abet a bit of larceny involving the husband. Which has major unfortunate consequences for Driver and especially for the husband. Suffice to say they involve the movie producer -- a crime boss who doesnt shy away from shoving forks in peoples eyes when he wants to make a point. And his associate (Ron Perlman) whose methods are even less subtle. What ensues is a suspenseful cat-and-mouse game that ratchets up the tension. There are also some really spectacular chase sequences beautifully photographed by Newton Thomas Sigel. Its fun but the script credited to Hossein Amini (""The Wings of the Dove"") is short on characterization and long on plot twists and wisecracks. The best wisecracks go to Brooks who stands a good chance at an Oscar nomination. He remarks at one point that the films his character produced in the 80s were described as ""European"" by one critic. Another debit is the overrated Mulligan. Its a stretch to believe Gosling would risk his life for her. Refn would have been better off going with a femme-fatale type played by an actress like Christina Hendricks (""Mad Men"") who has an all-too-brief role as the accomplice of Mulligans husband. ""Drive"" is not a bad movie by a long shot -- but its the kind of thriller thats likelier to excite critics than the moviegoing public. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Crack Swan takes flight Read Next Crack Swan takes flight Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 42626 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21540 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 14896 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Drive Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Ryan GoslingMovie review DriveRyan Gosling and Carey Mulligan star in Nicolas Winding Refns uncomfortable mixing of classic noir and contemporary mayhem.September 16 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan star in ""Drive."" (Richard Foreman Jr / Film...)""Drive"" is a Los Angeles neo-noir a neon-lit crime story made with lots of visual style. Its a film in love with both traditional noir mythology and ultra-modern violence a combination that is not ideal. Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn won the best director award at Cannes and its easy to see why this tale of an emotionless wheelman (Ryan Gosling) who lives to drive and makes a rare stab at human connection with a fetching neighbor took the prize. Impeccably shot by Newton Thomas Sigel ""Drive"" always looks dressed to kill. Making fine use of Los Angeles locations particularly the lonely downtown streets around the L.A. River ""Drive"" has a slick highly romanticized pastel look calculated to win friends and influence people. Less user-friendly is the films disturbing violence. ""Drive"" doesnt spend a lot of time on mayhem but what does get put on screen is intense unsettling and increasingly grotesque and graphic as the film goes on. For fans of director Refn known among chaos aficionados for made-in-Europe violent fare like ""The Pusher"" trilogy and ""Bronson"" this is bloody business as usual. But the mayhem here so clashes with the high style and traditionalism of the rest of the film that when the bloodletting goes into overdrive so to speak it throws you out of the picture diluting the mood rather than enhancing it. Certainly there could be no more familiar character to movie fans than the films protagonist so iconic hes reminiscent of Alain Delons Jef Costello in Jean-Pierre Melvilles classic ""Le Samourai"" and as written by Hossein Amini from the James Sallis novel so self-consciously mythologized he doesnt even have a name. Coolly played by Gosling the driver is a monosyllabic loner with a monotone voice a toothpick in his mouth and a fondness for a silver racing jacket with a giant yellow scorpion on the back. By day he works in a garage on Reseda Boulevard run by hard luck Shannon (""Breaking Bads"" Bryan Cranston) and does stunt driving for the movies. Once the sun goes down he drives getaway cars for criminal types. ""There are 100000 streets in this city"" the driver says echoing the famous ""there are 8 million stories in the naked city"" line of yore. Just tell him where and when to pick you up a and dont even think about making him wait more than five minutes a and he promises to ferry you to safety. For a price. ""Drive"" opens with what might be its most successful least violent set piece a getaway from a robbery choreographed to quietly insistent techno music by Johnny Jewel. As he plays cat and mouse with L.A.s finest the driver reveals himself to be a highly proficient emotionless technician with nerves of tempered steel. When the man pulls on his leather driving gloves its best to get out of the way. Trying to keep as low a profile as possible the driver lives in an apartment building next to MacArthur Park and shops in the picturesque Big 6 supermarket nearby. To say that he is closed off to all forms of human emotion is putting it very mildly indeed. But hey wouldnt you know it living right down the hall from the driver is Irene (Carey Mulligan underutilized) an attractive young woman who does have a name. She also has a young son named Benicio (Kaden Leos) who the driver inexplicably takes a fatherly interest in. Whatever this films strengths psychological motivation is not one of them. Before this platonic idyll can get out of first gear Irenes husband Standard (the gifted Oscar Isaac) comes back from the prison where hes been conveniently warehoused and the driver prepares to retreat into his mythic shell. But wait. Standard comes home to trouble with some bad guys bad guys who make the mistake of threatening Irene and young Benicio. Ever the knight errant the driver volunteers his help but everything starts to go wrong in ways that lead to all that bloodshed. Though many aspects of ""Drive"" are for better or worse intentionally familiar there is one element that is different and that is Albert Brooks performance as Bernie Rose a genial but dangerous criminal of the drivers acquaintance. The actor brings a fine air of scornful eccentric menace to the role. When people die in his presence its not laughter theyre dying of. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSummer Movie Sneaks complete listApril 28 2013Review Dont mess with Liam Neeson in Taken 2October 4 2012Kind of evilNovember 17 2011Movie review Blue ValentineDecember 29 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTRyan GoslingMayhemCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-drive-20110916,0,5263663.story?track=rss",200,drive(2011)11,drive(2011),latimes

STORY Interview with Ryan GoslingThe look is artfully stylized influenced by classic film noir; the mood is dark; the performances nuanced; and the story unnervingly exciting.Gosling identified only as Driver pilots cars for a living. Nothing else is revealed about him. In other films this lack of back story could be a handicap. Here its no impediment; the present is so tense that audiences are caught up only in the pulse-quickening moment.Driver seems to have almost sprung into life as a coiled confident and closed-off man. Its hard to imagine him having a childhood. So his unexpected bond with Irene (Carey Mulligan) a sweet young mother who lives in his apartment building and her sad-eyed little boy is all the more intriguing.The film opens with Gosling calmly maneuvering a getaway car for a pair of thieves. He knows downtown L.A. so well that he outwits a platoon of squad cars and helicopters.About the film Drive   1/2 out of fourStars Ryan Gosling Carey Mulligan Bryan Cranston Albert BrooksDirector Nicolas Winding RefnDistributor Film District Rating R for strong brutal and bloody violence language and some nudityRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens Friday nationwideDriver dabbles in criminal jobs by night but during the daylight hours he is an agile stunt driver and mechanic. He has a set of personal ethics that govern his association with the unsavory types he abets. His services are a limited-time offer. Hell assist their escape for only a number of minutes. After that theyre on their own.In the hands of a lesser actor Driver could have been an empty vessel. But Gosling pumps the minimalist character with brooding complexity. Danish-born director Nicolas Winding Refns tight camera angles on Goslings soulful eyes or clenched jaw serve to heighten the trance-like quality of the film. This art-house crime saga has a distinctly European sensibility. The film slows down to a deliberate pace then revs on a dime to frantic speeds. Drenched in strikingly violent imagery it may be off-putting for the squeamish.Breaking Bads Bryan Cranston plays Drivers manager. Albert Brooks cleverly plays against type as a vicious mobster. Drive has an almost moralistic fairy-tale quality amid the graphic violence. Driver is both a protector of the innocent and a punisher of evildoers. A brutal beating in an elevator is an unforgettable scene for its juxtaposition with a tender kiss.Thoroughly immersing Drive leaves the competition in the dust.

(Richard Foreman/AP) Joe Neumaier Thursday September 15 2011 425 PM Title Drive With Ryan Gosling Carey Mulligan. A getaway driver takes on a job that threatens his life. Director Nicolas Winding Refn. (140) R Violence. At area theaters.For all the movement in ""Drive"" the quiet deathly still moments are the ones that count. A getaway drivers eyes watching minutes tick by. A scary businessman holding out his hand for a handshake. Two people meeting in a hallway locking their doors without saying a word.And the most still thing of all is Ryan Gosling whose coiled performance as a nameless Hollywood stunt driver cruising into trouble provides one of the most tense turns in this already hushful actors young career.Not that there isnt tire squealing and hairpin maneuvers in ""Drive"" which contains a pair of scenes which show that this action-drama understands the elegant art of the car chase. Theres also plenty of blood-letting standoffs shootouts and wordless mini-meditations on men and criminality. Yet its the movies threateningly low hum while it sits idling that really gets you.Goslings driver is never identified though his garage mechanic employer Shannon (Bryan Cranston) calls him ""kid."" A man of fewer-than-few words the kid is behind the wheel when a movie needs a spectacular crash. In his off hours hes a wheelman for hire zipping around and through shadowy Los Angeles streets aiding and abetting robberies for a price.A normally careful guy the driver is Shannons way out of a dead-end life when a low-rent crime boss named Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) agrees to backing a stock car design Shannon has developed. But Rose and his thuggish partner (Ron Perlman) are unscrupulous and murderous and unknown to everyone have a connection to the pretty neighbor (Carey Mulligan) who has cracked the drivers tough shell.Directed by the acceleratedly named Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn winner of the Best Director prize at Cannes ""Drive"" is set in the present-day but has a quirky 80s fixation in lighting music and mood that could have stalled it. Refns choice in neon lights and obscure synth-pop wind up putting ""Drive"" in the company of that eras ""Thief"" and ""Manhunter"" while other elements link it with ""F/X"" and even ""American Gigolo."" Its a risky move but it pays off.And though Mulligan is miscast as a hard-luck mother awaiting her husbands parole Gosling is eerily magnetic and gets great support from Cranston Perlman Christina Hendricks (as a Tarantino-trashy burglary accessory) and especially Brooks. The comic-author-director does big-screen dramas about once a decade and is clearly having fun here as a schlock producer-turned-barbarian with a thing for cutlery. Like everything else in ""Drive"" he can go from zero to 90 in a heartbeat.Magic Moment In a life-or-death struggle the driver and a villains shadows merge blending them into one knife-wielding image.

Sugary pop the kind you might hear in a John Hughes movie accentuates the love in the air. The lovely lady has a husband in prison a fact that makes the new guy seem like an even sweeter alternative.Then the worms begin to crawl out of the apple. The husband (Oscar Isaac) gets out and hes in trouble. Our Driver ever chivalrous tries to lend a hand. Before you can say ""widespread carnage"" Drive turns into a stylized bloodbath complete with smashed faces crunching bones sliced veins and all of those other things that say true romance.It feels like two movies. Which according to Nicolas Winding Refn who won the best director prize at this years Cannes Film Festival is precisely the point.""Its a like fairy tale"" Refn explains during a recent stop in Dallas. ""The first half of the movie is like champagne. Its all about purity of love and the innocence of love. Its an uncomplicated relationship. The first time you meet a girl its about love as an ideal.""And when reality intrudes?""The other half is about the complexity of love"" Refn says. ""When he cant have her he has to turn to violence. Violence is essentially another word for love. His violence comes out of his protection of her innocence.""Drive has a juicy cast of shady characters including Albert Brooks (wonderfully cast as a reluctant but menacing heavy) Breaking Bads Bryan Cranston Mad Mens Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman. But the two primary players are Gosling and Los Angeles.Gosling grows more fascinating each time out. Here his placid eerily cool demeanor is offset by a lopsided grin that slowly spreads whenever his character is briefly confronted by happiness. As Refn points out Gosling is one of a handful of stars working now that neednt say a word to command the screen.Then theres the City of Angels. Gosling and Refn set to re-team next year in Only God Forgives prepared by spending countless hours cruising through LA talking up a storm cranking up the tunes and figuring out where they wanted to shoot (and what they could afford). The result is one of the best Los Angeles travelogues since Michael Mann sent Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx on a long deadly cab ride in Collateral.Drive is a lean genre movie with artistic aspirations. Refn a Danish director who cut his teeth with violent cult favorites including the Pusher trilogy and Bronson is a master of visual composition with a flair for the ultraviolent crescendo. Im not sure if it quite deserves the deafening buzz accumulated from its Cannes premiere but this is a sharp cut above the standard franchise action fare.

Daily Edition Login to download Drive Cannes 2011 Review 449 AM PDT 5/20/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Tasty if sketchy modern noir with car chases and bloody action that should turn the trick for genre-seeking audiences. TWITTER The arty Danish fast-cars-and-crime thriller directed by Nicolas Winding Refn should be promotable to good box office results from both discerning and popcorn audiences come September. CANNES -- A spasmodically violent creatively cast and off-center fast-cars-and-crime drama Drive belongs to a rarified genre subset of stripped down semi-arty and quasi-existentialist action films that includes Point Blank Bullitt and The Driver. With Ryan Gosling ably incarnating a pent-up man of few words who goes to great lengths to make one positive gesture in a rotten world Danish wunderkind Nicolas Winding Refn has fashioned an atmospheric and engaging glorified potboiler that nonetheless seems powered by a half-empty creative tank. Not the sort of film normally seen in the competition at Cannes this moody and bloody entry should be promotable to good box office results from both discerning and popcorn audiences come September. Never speaking unless absolutely necessary Goslings unnamed Driver works doing movie stunts during the day and moonlights as a robbery getaway driver. The sharply executed opening sequence shows Drivers complete mastery of Los Angeles streets as well as his grace under pressure as he threads his way through a net of police cars and helicopters to escape from a nocturnal warehouse break-in. Drawn to an appealing neighbor in his near-downtown apartment building Irene (Carey Mulligan) Driver does more talking with his eyes than with his mouth. An initial exchange between them sums up the semi-philosophical borderline hilarious sort of dialogue that often finds its way into this kind of fare. Irene ""Whaddya do?"" Driver ""I drive."" We never learn much more about the man than that but he quickly takes a strong interest in the welfare of this young woman who has a cute young son (Kaden Leos) whose dad is in prison. At the same time it appears that Drivers professional fortunes might be improving as his longtime boss and patron gimpy-legged auto shop owner Shannon (Bryan Cranston) makes a deal with big-bucks investor Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) to back Driver as a stock car racer. When Irenes man named Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released he expresses regret over his former actions and genuine appreciation for his shot at a second chance. However an unpaid debt unknown links to Bernies vulgar criminal pal Nino (Ron Perlman) a botched robbery and deeply entrenched venality on several fronts pull Driver into a treacherous underworld that ultimately requires far more of him than his driving skill. The lulls between set pieces tend to be quiet and moody which dramatically offsets the efficiently executed car chases and the killings that mount up -- and become increasing gory -- as the bad deeds multiply. The downtime never threatens to become dull not with this cast nor with Refns lively style and the wildly eclectic soundtrack thats embedded in techno music but extends well beyond it. All the same Hossein Aminis adaptation of James Sallis short novel feels more threadbare than bracingly terse; hes clearly aspiring to the sort of spare muscularity in crime writing pioneered by Hemingway in The Killers and subsequently employed by many others. Amini simply doesnt build enough subtext and layering beneath the surface of the characters and dialogue; the tough talk is simply not loaded the way it is in the best noirs so the lack of resonance is manifest. Possibly for the same reason something analogous takes place visually as well. Refn who has built himself a substantial following on the basis of such stylishly powerful works as the Pusher trilogy Bronson and Valhalla Rising creates a strong imprint with his vision of a dark seamy L.A. (Newton Thomas Sigel was the resourceful cinematographer) and the violence increasingly goes beyond what you expect. But there are no sequences here that thrill or absolutely kick butt in the maximum genre way (except for the creative manner some killings are done). The good stuff here is quite good but it doesnt reach the highest level. So its a fun if not exhilarating ride one sped along with the help of a wonderfully assembled cast. Gosling here makes a bid to enter the iconic ranks of tough self-possessed American screen actors -- Steve McQueen Clint Eastwood Lee Marvin -- who express themselves through actions rather than words. Sometimes (mostly around Irene) his Driver smiles too much but Gosling assumes just the right posture of untroubled certainty in the driving scenes and summons unsuspected reserves when called upon for very rough stuff later on. Mulligan seen only in classy fare up to now is a delightful choice as the sweet but bereft Irene while Isaac invests his jailbird with unanticipated intelligence and sincerity. Christina Hendricks isnt around for long but makes a strong impression as an accomplice in an ill-advised robbery. Cranston applies craggy color to his good-guy loser while Perlman pushes the evil all the way. Most surprising of all however is Brooks who is wonderful as a rich reasonable-sounding gent whos better than the others at hiding that hes a total s.o.b.

That may give you some sense of this highly stylized often beautiful and graphically violent action drama about a mechanic and part-time movie stunt driver who moonlights as a wheelman. It will be an incomplete sense though. Depending on the second-by-second circumstances The Driver might also be called The Lover Dreamer Benefactor Brute or Killer--hes actually all of those things in the time and space of a single elevator ride. Few actors working today could make emotional sense of such a protean character but Ryan Gosling does so with calm authority. Hes a formidable presence in a film that grabs your gaze and wont let go except for moments when you cant help but look away. ENLARGE Top Ryan Gosling as The Driver in Drive. FilmDistrict ""Drive"" was directed by Nicolas Winding Refn from Hossein Aminis adaptation of a noirish novel by James Sallis. Mr. Refn born in Denmark but a New Yorker since childhood brought a Continental flair to several violent features starting with the 1996 ""Pusher"" that have earned him a cult following. (In ""Drive"" a pitiless thug claims to have produced sexy action movies in the 1980s ""One critic"" he says dryly ""called them European."") This penchant for suspenseful mayhem gives pace and shape to a story that otherwise wouldnt be much more than a tone poem. After befriending Irene (Carey Mulligan) a neighbor whose husband is in prison The Driver finds himself in an awkward position when the husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released and comes home. Then his impulsive generosity puts him in a perilous position vis-a-vis ruthless crooks who are using him in ways he cant comprehend. Watch a clip from the film ""Drive"" starring Ryan Gosling. Video courtesy of FilmDistrict. That peril like the action flowing from it is intense--a hold-up gone bad; car chases through the streets of Los Angeles; car combat that involves some spectacular driving in reverse; car characterization that puts the way-cool hero into an unassuming Chevy Impala with 300 horses hidden under the hood or later a spirited stolen Mustang and the bad guys into a massive hunch-shouldered Chrysler 300 sedan. I wont describe the mayhem in detail because I dont want you looking away from the page. The tone-poem parts are pretty wonderful too thanks to Newton Thomas Sigels cinematography which is gorgeous even when the camera is only surveying flat surfaces; to the sound track which ranges from ecstatic harmonies to overmodulations that sound like a cars harsh exhaust note and to the directors fondness for enchanted attenuated encounters as in the moments which go from slo-mo to no-mo when The Driver and Irene first meet. ""Drive"" matches the nakedly brutal (an explosion of violence in a nightclub that evokes Weimar decadence) with the scruffily lyrical (The Driver taking Irene and her sweetly soulful young son Benicio--hes played by Kaden Leos--for a drive down the barely moist cement channel of the Los Angeles River.) Most of the supporting performances are flawless. Ms. Mulligan gives Irene an air of bittersweet expectancy; youre not sure because Irene isnt sure whether shes awaiting pleasure or pain. Mr. Isaac uses the astutely written specifics of the husbands role to make him likable as well as memorable. Christina Hendrickss Blanche is so much a moll that she should have been called The Moll. As the thug who once produced movies Albert Brooks is both the essence of simplicity and evil incarnate; its a small but sensational performance. Ron Perlman by contrast is intrusively grotesque as another murderous monster though the way hes photographed suggests that its not his fault. The director unduly taken by his actors singular physiognomy may have allowed or encouraged the excess. Then theres Mr. Gosling and the ongoing mystery of how he manages to have so much impact with so little apparent effort. Its irresistible to liken his economical style to that of Marlon Brando; like Brando he has a surprisingly light even boyish voice that can seem to be escaping his throat rather than being sent forth from it. But peerless though Brando was he could be mannered to the point of self-parody. That hasnt happened to Mr. Gosling. He keeps it fresh whether its the droll self-assurance of his womanizer in ""Crazy Stupid Love"" or the doomily seductive inwardness of The Driver in ""Drive."" He and this powerful film which is ultimately about a moment of grace deserve each other. Hes the mediums most graceful minimalist. Happy Happy In her casually daring--and mostly endearing--debut feature the Norwegian director Anne Sewitsky mixes and purposely mismatches light and dark moods to tell the story of a rural wife and mother looking for happiness in the wrong places and finally in the right one. (The film which was written by Ragnhild Tronvoll is Norways foreign-language entry in this years Academy Awards.) Kaja whos vulnerable in ways we can only intuit at first is played with unsettling good cheer by Agnes Kittelsen. Shes the picture of domestic contentment as well as generous hospitality when a couple of urban sophisticates Sigve and Elisabeth and their adopted Ethiopian son Noa move into the house next to hers. (Theyre played by Henrik Rafaelsen Maibritt Saerens and Ram Shihab Ebedy. Joachim Rafaelsen--no relation--is Eirik Kajas prickly husband.) Soon enough though the mood darkens the sexual plot thickens and both women start to reveal the separate but equal sadness that swirls beneath the surface of their lives. ENLARGE Agnes Kittelsen as Kaja in Happy Happy. Magnolia Pictures ""Happy Happy"" wont make you happy if you hold to the notion that a movie can be funny or serious but not both. And particularly not both at the same time as in several eerie scenes that find Kajas and Eiriks young son Theodor playing master and slave with Noa. Yet those scenes furnish fair comment on other kinds of enslavement--to the idealized notion of family to the desperate need for love--that has kept Kaja from the happiness she has always craved. Perhaps another comment is too obviously on the nose when Kaja a timid soloist with a local church choir gets to sing ""Amazing Grace"" with those familiar lines ""I once was lost but now am found."" Still more comment is dispensed sporadically and amusingly by a gospel quartet with an amazing bass and even by President Barack Obama who watched by Noa on a notebook computer says it may come as no surprise given the ""dizzying pace of globalization"" that ""people fear the loss of what they cherish."" The movie doesnt need all that explication though it doesnt really get in the way. Kaja explains herself eloquently in the course of discovering herself. I Dont Know How She Does It A stressogenic comedy about stress this screen version of Allison Pearsons debut novel stars Sarah Jessica Parker as Kate Reddy a superachiever struggling to juggle the demands of motherhood and career. Her juggling act excludes surprises; every ball plate and dumbbell comes down exactly where you expect it to. And every scene is clearly labeled in Aline Brosh McKennas screenplay which resembles nothing so much as a PowerPoint presentation--this means this that means that--with bullet points emphasized by on-camera interviews of the heroines friends and associates. (The two men in her life earnest husband and cautiously amorous business partner are played by Greg Kinnear and Pierce Brosnan.) ENLARGE Sarah Jessica Parker as Kate in I Dont Know How She Does It. The Weinstein Company Does Kates insane striving both as a mother and financial analyst reflect the contemporary lives of real people? It does indeed. On a long flight last weekend I watched a scarily earnest mother use one of those your-baby-can-read books to teach vocabulary words to her six-month-old daughter who stared at the pages in total bafflement. And the inside of a working womans head may well be as one of Kates friends says like the control tower at OHare airport. (The friend who says it--Christina Hendricks in perky mode-- has no useful role in the action; shes just there for clever comments.) But the movie which was directed by Douglas McGrath establishes Kates basic--and by now banal--conflict early on then never stops for a moments reflection as distinct from explanation. Long after lice from her childrens school infested Kates scalp I was scratching my head about why a 91-minute movie seemed so long. The answer came from reframing the question. Why was a string of sitcom problems stretched to 91 minutes? DVD FOCUS They Drive by Night (1940) ENLARGE Raoul Walshs film is really two films uncomfortably combined as everyone has noted since its release seven decades ago. One half with George Raft Humphrey Bogart and Alan Hale is about independent truck drivers trying to make an honest living. The other with its standard-brand melodramatics is dominated by Ida Lupinos going-mad scene in a courtroom. Not to be confused with Nicholas Rays vastly superior 1948 feature ""They Live By Night"" which was adapted from an Edward Anderson novel that was also the progenitor of Robert Altmans marvelous and grievously underappreciated 1974 film ""Thieves Like Us."" OHorten (2007) An early scene in Bent Hamers humane comedy in Norwegian with English subtitles depicts the power that the taciturn hero enjoys and will soon be forced to surrender. An engineer who must soon retire Odd Horten sits serene at the controls of a sleek locomotive pulling a passenger train from Oslo to Bergen through a silent snowscape. The literal subject is retirement and the prospect of loss. But Mr. Hamer a poet of the droll and askew sends the aptly named Odd on a cockeyed journey from regret through comic confusion to a lovely eagerness for new adventures. Emma (1996) During a cheerful interlude of lawn archery in Douglas McGraths screen version of Jane Austens comic tour de force one of the heroines arrows lands in the grass below a big overstuffed target. If the arrow is emblematic of Emmas penchant for missing the point in human affairs its also the only thing that falls significantly short of the mark in this deftly understated production with Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role. An American actress and an American director in his feature debut have made a Jane Austen movie that outshines its predecessors by not trying to shine at all.

There is romantic Gosling (Crazy Stupid Love) and edgy Method Gosling (The Believer) and quirky indie Gosling (Lars and the Real Girl) and lumpen burnout Gosling (Blue Valentine) and psycho killer Gosling (Murder by Numbers). But who is Gosling qua Gosling? What is Gosling boiled down to purest Goslingness? What if there were a filmed entertainment that gave Gosling few words fewer motivations and fewest expressions?

He has no friends though he does have a squirrely employer (Bryan Cranston) whos in deep with a sulfurous gangster (Hellboys Ron Perlman) and his ex-movie-producer associate (Albert Brooks brilliantly cast). He has no girl of his own; hes smitten with the wistful mom down the hall (Carey Mulligan) but her husband is about to return home from prison. And he has no name perhaps because there are too many names to choose from ""Driver"" (as the credits call him) evokes the taciturn loner heroes of Eastwood McQueen and the eponym of Walter Hills The Driver (1978). See the All-TIME best car chases including Steve McQueen in Bullitt.Like Goslings Driver Drive is to a great extent the sum of its influences. Refn who has a passionate cult following and some unlikely art-house cred for his deliriously violent Pusher trilogy and Bronson is a child of the 1980s. For him To Live and Die in L.A. and the collected works of Michael Mann are sacred texts to be restaged (more slo-mo More blood More crunching of bone) and Goslingized. If 80s axiom Molly Ringwald had a custom font it would be the jagged pink cursive of Drives opening titles. Even the pop songs have the cocaine-cheesy sheen of a synth power ballad from the Miami Vice soundtrack. Minimalist Gosling has a heart and it beats to a drum machine. That heart is big and strong and selfless But it can express itself only through wicked steering maneuvers fisticuffs and placid TV-watching with Mulligans son. And crime to get her hubby out of a pinch Gosling agrees to a pro bono heist that goes awry as expected leaving him holding a bag full of Perlmans and Brooks money. This is when the engines really start gunning and the heads really start exploding and the pearl-handled razors really start coming out. (By the way if you want to see Christina Hendricks -- Mad Mens Joan Holloway -- in jeans and stilettos heres your chance.) From the heist onward Drive hits and maintains a steady rhythm of neon-lit paranoia punctuated by detonations of violence. The car chases are brisk and to the point. The murders are brisk and glutinous. (The most satisfying may be a twofer car crash-drowning that Gosling executes in a stuntmans cawl when Drive for a moment becomes a lost entry in the Halloween franchise Michael Myers Hits the Beach.) And the supporting players are B-movie bliss leaving grit and grime on everything they touch. Surely theres a current crime serial (Boardwalk Empire? Cranstons Breaking Bad?) that could create a villain role for Brooks who plays his psychopath as an irritable pragmatist with a curatorial eye for sharp objects. See Halloween in TIMEs top 10 movie franchises. Minimalist Gosling makes for a magnetic cyborg and Minimalist Mulligan tries to match him whether Gosling is just gazing at her (which he does a lot) or divesting a baddies face from his jaw in an elevator (which he does only once) she arranges her face into a picture of sad-eyed amusement with occasional variations of amused sadness. Their romance follows a chronology not of banter flirtation and foreplay but stares and blinks. Refns mix of grind-house horror with sweetie-pie sentiment is a recipe mastered by Takeshi Kitano (and in his own way David Lynch) but this directors brew is simpler more direct less cerebral and less heartfelt. To invest oneself emotionally in the central relationship or the movie itself would be akin to investing oneself emotionally in ones car. But when the car looks this good and drives this fast why not? See Ryan Gosling among the top 10 fake TIME magazine covers.

More about Drive >> Ryan Gosling exudes no-sweat professionalism in Drive a shamelessly entertaining genre movie from director Nicolas Winding Refn that plays like an exalted episode of Miami Vice or a stealth version of Shane. As the enigmatic Man With No Name and Few Words Gosling is a knight in shining bomber jacket a white-satin affair with a scorpion embroidered on the back. He takes a shine to his neighbor Irene (Mulligan) a cherubic mom and her young son (Kaden Leos) as the two wait out Daddys prison sentence. Driver (as he is identified in the credits) is a hired wheel who favors plain-Jane vehicles with lots of horses under the hood all the better to confound and outspeed the cops. Driver doesnt carry a weapon simply uses whatever is handy - his fists a hammer a tire iron - in bursts of bloody violence that suggest he knows his way around a gun cylinder almost as well as a cylinder block. His mentor is Shannon (Bryan Cranston grizzled and gimpy) for whom he works as a mechanic and who represents him both in his stunt and getaway gigs. Shannon hopes to make Driver a legitimate race-car hero soliciting backing from mobbed-up moneymen Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman. The former is nastily funny; the latter just nasty. Sleekly made by Refn the Danish filmmaker who took the best director prize for Drive at Cannes the film is stylish suspenseful and laced with sentimentality. Refn uses silence and subliminal synthesizer sounds to ratchet up the tension (listen to the squ-e-e-e-a-k of Driver peeling off his racing gloves as he is being stalked) and techno-pop accompanying slo-mo sequences to amplify the romantic angle. Gosling chews on an unlit match to steady Drivers nerves - and ours - but only nibbles at the scenery a nocturnal Los Angeles ribboned with roads that have more curves than Mulligans heart-shaped lips. His self-contained performance is one of almost ethereal impassivity his responses a beat later than expected and a half-beat ahead of his adversaries; Refn skillfully plays with the rhythms of his characters and their cars. Drive takes a hairpin turn when its hero volunteers to drive getaway in a heist by Irenes newly released spouse (Oscar Isaac). The result is uniquely satisfying Nordic Noir for those who can stomach the violence. Its not art but arty mainstream. Drive  (out of four stars) Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn.

I Really Dont Care How She Does It Hakuna Matata Baby Lion King 3D Races to 20M+ Pace at Box Office Theres a sleek machine in here somewhere but director Nicholas Winding Refn has buried it in optional extras Theres a sleek pulse-pounding heart-racing machine in ""Drive"" but its buried deeply under an oppressive package of optional extras. For all of its good ideas -- and there are plenty of them -- the film eventually buckles under an excess of style. Ryan Gosling stars as the films never-named protagonist (shades of the similarly nameless heroes of ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" and ""The Driver"") who works by day as a mechanic and occasional Hollywood stunt driver and sometimes by night as a fast and furious getway-car driver for thieves. His boss in all of these pursuits is the limping Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who himself lives under the thumb of mobster brothers Bernie (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman) -- Bernie may be ""the nice one"" compared to the sadistic Nino but both siblings are bad news. Bernie fronts Shannon the money to buy a stock car and put ""the Kid"" (as Bernie calls Goslings character) on the racing circuit but this is a movie about petty criminals looking to improve their lot in life and on screen that never goes well. The Kid has become smitten with Irene (Carey Mulligan) who lives down the hall with her young son but when Irenes husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) comes home from prison the ex-con gets blackmailed into robbing a pawn shop to cover protection money he owes from his time behind bars. The Kid offers to drive the getaway car for Standard so that he -- and more importantly to the Kid Irene and her son -- can be free of any further threats. But all roads lead back to Nino which means that no one is safe. Director Nicholas Winding Refn has made a name for himself in international cinema with the ""Pusher"" trilogy ""Bronson"" and ""Valhalla Rising"" movies that combine a bold visionary style with an unrepentant exploration of masculine violence. And while ""Drive"" very much fits into that category -- we see the Kids darker impulses become more manifest as the plot unfolds -- Refn allows his eye for stylishness to overwhelm the proceedings. Hes clearly shooting for a Michael Mann vibe with the black-lacquer sheen of L.A. by night and the thumpa-thumpa Vangelis-meets-Tangerine-Dream score by Cliff Martinez. (Even the satin jacket favored by the Kid and the hot pink VHS-era font on the titles would have looked right at home on old episodes of ""Miami Vice."" That the filmmakers didnt throw in The Cars 1984 hit single ""Drive"" as well is one of the movies few examples of restraint.) But the art direction winds up being too much; in its own way ""Drive"" is as aesthetically over the top as Sofia Coppolas ""Marie Antoinette."" Thats a shame because theres a lot to admire here from the movies amped-up chase scenes to a charismatically monstrous performance by Albert Brooks thats like nothing youve ever seen from the comedy veteran. Brooks comic on-screen persona from his own movies to his unforgettable role in ""Broadcast News"" have always been id-based but here he dishes out an even darker side that allows him to pretty much steal the movie in just a handful of scenes. Also making the most out of a small role is Christina Hendricks who turns in her sexpot ""Mad Men"" outfits for some wildly unflattering and trashy ensembles. Attractive actresses often get too much credit when theyre willing to ugly themselves up but Hendricks completely buries herself into the character -- shes not just sacrificing vanity but also allowing the role to take over. Gosling flourishes most when hes holding back his emotions -- or in rare moments lashing out with brutality -- but his relationship with Irene never feels fully-formed limited as it is to a series of gooey smiles the two exchange. And while no ones going to see ""Drive"" for the love story were supposed to believe that its the Kids feelings for Irene that brings him out of his shell and puts him into conflict with some very bad folks so the romance represents a major plot point even if the film never treats it that way. ""Drive"" is the sort of movie that will forever more turn up on lists of ""Iconic Films About Los Angeles"" and ""Best Car Chases"" but its a pity that its best parts are so often undercut by miscalculations from the talented Refn who directs like a man confidently and assuredly taking a left turn into a pond and insisting that hes forging his own path.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Drama requires emotions and cool requires their suppression. The tautly paced peerlessly stylish crime drama ""Drive"" has it both ways. This homage to old-school getaway movies has the kick-ass energy of a supercharged engine flaring to life. But the film turns its genre inside out spending more time with the characters than youd expect. When the violence erupts its all the more powerful because the people involved are vivid complicated individuals. Good guys and bad guys have never been harder to peg which is why ""Drive"" is so gripping filled with nuance and subtlety rarely found in muscle-car melodramas. You feel this movies authority in its nearly mute opening sequence. A nameless man (stoic Ryan Gosling) waits behind the wheel of an anonymous car on an industrial street in Los Angeles. Two nervous thieves jump in; he eases into the night at a leisurely pace. When squad cars near he parks his expression steely-eyed calm. He slips beneath overpasses to evade spotter helicopters. There are high-revving moments but this midnight run is about more than grinding the accelerator to the floor. The driver is playing a high stakes game of strategy and misdirection. He completes his mission with a move worthy of a chess grand master. This series of tactical moves and countermoves is spare muscular filmmaking of the highest order. ""Drive"" doesnt just focus on the job it focuses also on the man. Goslings criminal is complex and troubled. The detached driver sees himself as an independent loner a next-generation Steve McQueen. In truth hes a solitary lonely kid often isolated in the film frame silently yearning to belong to somebody. He trusts his mentor Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who employs him as a mechanic and sells his services as a movie stunt driver and criminals chauffeur. Shannon has plans for the stuntman certain that with a big enough financial stake to buy a stock car he could be a racing champion. A surrogate father is fine but the young man needs more. When the driver meets his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) whose husband is in prison he falls in love with the fresh-faced stranger. She fulfills his desire for a conventional life that is forever beyond his reach. He treats her young son as tenderly as if he were the father. When Irenes husband is paroled but in debt to a prison gang the driver steps in to help. He takes on his biggest job ever only to find murderous criminals blocking his path. With its slightly grainy exploitation movie look 80s-retro opening titles and techno-tinged soundtrack ""Drive"" pretends to be a straighter more conventional film than it is. Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn has created a self-conscious homage to drive-in movie mayhem but instead of mimicking it he employs intelligence and talent to make it come alive again. He knows how to rouse our moving-violation hormones and how to work moody plotless moments as well. He ratchets up anxiety with effective editing and muted menacing performances. Albert Brooks is especially strong as a villain who masks his true viciousness with an affable demeanor and a ready handshake. Ron Perlman as his partner in crime projects a hearty malevolence that detours into cowardice. In its final chapters ""Drive"" takes the shape of a stock revenge tale but it refuses to turn simplistic. In the inventively staged showdown your heart wants to bet one way and your head the other. Turning a sows ear into a silk purse is a neat trick. ""Drive"" transforms pulp-pop hogwash into an experience that etches its way into the mind miraculous.

Comments (3) click to enlarge Drive Rated R  100 minutes  2011 Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made a name for himself with the brutal proudly amoral Pusher trilogy then successfully exported his personal brand of mayhem to the UK for the fact-based prison drama Bronson (2008). This feature marks his Hollywood debut and though it easily surpasses most American action flicks it suffers from the old commercial imperative of making the protagonist a nice guy something Refn has seldom bothered with in Europe. Ryan Gosling plays an impassively cool wheelman who divides his time between movie stunt work and criminal jobs as a getaway driver; after falling (unpersuasively) for perky Carey Mulligan and her cute son he defends them from ruthless crime lord Albert Brooks wholl do anything to recover the cash-stuffed suitcase her husband stole. This stale premise taken from a novel by James Sallis kept reminding me of a Steve McQueen vehicle and in fact Refn has named Bullitt (1968) as one reference point. The able supporting cast includes Bryan Cranston Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman. By J.R. Jones User Rating Official Site www.drive-movie.comDirector Nicolas RefnProducer Marc E.

RICHARD FOREMAN JR SMPSP Ryan Gosling in ""Drive"" (FilmDistrict) Richard Foreman Jr SMPSP Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan in ""Drive"" (FilmDistrict) Director Nicolas Winding Refn was born in Denmark doesnt drive and says he has never been in a fight. But he spent his 80s childhood in New York where he gorged on movies by Martin Scorsese and John Hughes.Refns love of both violent flicks and fairy tales has spawned ""Drive"" a two-headed creature with sharp claws and a squishy heart. The abrupt shifts between neo-noir fatalism and white-knight romanticism could give an unsuspecting viewer whiplash but Refn has a trusty map and keeps his hands on the wheel.Its set in the present but from the pink-lipstick font of the credits to the synth-pop bluster of the soundtrack ""Drive"" is a time machine bound for the 80s. Yet it also evokes the lone-hero motif of Clint Eastwood Westerns. Playing the man with no name is Ryan Gosling. Sometimes called the Kid hes a Hollywood stunt diver by day and a getaway driver by night. His manager-mentor-mechanic Shannon (Bryan Cranston) arranges the jobs and takes a hefty cut. And Shannons found a pair of shady investors -- a pizza mogul (Ron Perlman) and an ex-movie producer (Albert Brooks) -- to finance the Kids racing career. But the driver cruises through the underworld in a low gear revealing little about himself.Then he falls for a neighbor named Irene (Carey Mulligan) whos got a son in school and a husband in prison. When the husband (Oscar Isaac) gets released he pulls the Kid into a pawn shop heist with life-or-death consequences for Irene.""Drive"" circles around some familiar territory but half the time its speeding in the reverse direction of what we expect. For every chase or brutal beating theres the slow tension of a nighttime evasion or the thwarted thrill of an off-camera killing. As Refn is riffing on thriller cliches he gets solid support from the ensemble. Brooks a comedic standout since the 70s makes a sympathetic villain and Gosling stokes the young-Brando comparisons -- instead of settling for Richard Gere.""Drive"" delivers.

"Drive movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Drive Noir lives dies by its lookDrive a 2 1/2 starsSeptember 15 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticRyan Gosling stars in ""Drive.""""Drive"" begins extremely well and ends in a muddle of ultraviolence hypocrisy and stylistic preening which wont be any sort of deterrent for those who like its looks.Director Nicolas Winding Refns avenging-angel thriller premiered at this years Cannes Film Festival where Refn won the directing prize and every supersaturated image is designed for hushed adoration. If the movie were a movie star itd be looking just past you to see if someone cooler had recently come in.Ryan Gosling plays Driver a tight-lipped loner who puts the stench in ""existential"" and has nothing in his blinkered life outside his gig as stunt driver for the movies; his job at an auto repair garage run by his pal played by Bryan Cranston; and his illegal work as a getaway driver for criminals.The storys LA setting locates ""Drive"" in the category of sunshine-SoCal noir half-blue skies and shiny surfaces the other half nocturnal villainy.The superb Carey Mulligan plays Irene a Dennys waitress who lives down the hall from Driver in their MacArthur Park-area apartment complex which is decorated like Dorothy Vallens place in ""Blue Velvet."" Irenes lowlife husband (Oscar Isaac) is due out of prison soon; prior to his release Irene and their young son become friends with Driver who takes them for yes drives along the concrete basin of the LA River. How this glamorous cipher in the scorpion jacket becomes part of a troubled family unit and how he becomes the target of loutish mobsters played by Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman form the crisscrossing roads of the narrative.Its compelling for a good while. The pre-credit sequence -- the first robbery and getaway we see in ""Drive"" -- is one of the more gripping openings of the year. Refns tendency to turn every close-up into fashion photography is held in check. Drive is like the poseur nephew of the Lee Marvin character from ""Point Blank""; his is a world of shadows and solitary figures trapped in severely art-directed spaces. None of the behavior or dialogue in ""Drive"" consciously evokes human speech or planet Earth; were in movieland. For a while Refns noir tropes are seductive even though the story -- Driver stepping up as psycho-Shane protector of the waitress and her son and transforming into a blood-spattered revenge machine -- is the same old story albeit with supercool lighting and fastidious postproduction color correction.I especially like Mulligan one of the great listeners and empathetic interpreters in contemporary film and Brooks whose sleazy characters backslapping nature (the gangster used to be a movie producer) masks a bloodthirstiness at least until the blood starts flying. Before long and then with grinding relish ""Drive"" becomes one garishly sadistic set piece after another. Refn and screenwriter Hossein Amini adapting the novella by James Sallis dont have the interest or the guts to examine Driver from the inside if there is one. The sanctimonious 80s-sounding pap on the soundtrack keeps singing about ""heroes"" and the little guy. When an unlucky accomplice gets her head blasted by a shotgun the imagery politely points your attention to how the blood on the wallpaper contrasts with the green of the palm tree outside against the blue sky. Refn has a compositional eye and considerable craft as was clear in the earlier ""Bronson."" Hes also a bit of an airhead when it comes to the moral implications of the brutality he portrays.mjphillipstribune.comDrive -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong brutal bloody violence language and some nudity)Cast Ryan Gosling (Driver); Carey Mulligan (Irene); Bryan Cranston (Shannon); Albert Brooks (Bernie Rose); Oscar Isaac (Standard); Ron Perlman (Nino); Christina Hendricks (Blanche)Credits Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn; written by Hossein Amini based on James Sallis novella; produced by Michel Litvak Marc E.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""Im a driver"" says Ryan Gosling in Drive and he doesnt need to say another word. With that simple utterance Nicolas Winding Refns minimalist thriller defines its aesthetic--lean efficient and sharpened to the finest point. At a time when action films routinely pass off freneticness as excitement Drive is a reminder of how powerful the genre can be when every shot and every line of dialogue has a purpose deployed for maximum impact. Owing a debt to the Zen-like simplicity and nocturnal L.A. ambience of Walter Hills The Driver--which in turn took a page from Jean-Pierre Melvilles Le Samourai--the film is little more than an exercise in style but its dazzling and mythic a testament to the fundamental appeal of fast cars dangerous men and tension that squeezes like a hand to the throat. Based on a crime novel by James Sallis a disciple of pulp writers like Jim Thompson and David Goodis Drive squares nicely with Refns previous work particularly the Pusher trilogy which is about tough low-level hoods who scrap their way through a narrowing set of choices. A man with no name Gosling makes his skills apparent in the gripping opening sequence in which he calmly navigates a getaway car through a dense web of cop cars and police helicopters. An all-purpose wheelman Gosling also works as a Hollywood stuntman a grease monkey and a would-be stock-car racer and his talent attracts the interest of a vicious local mob boss--played in an inspired piece of casting by Albert Brooks. When Goslings attraction to a young mother (Carey Mulligan) leads him to assist her ex-con husband in a heist he runs afoul of the wrong people and struggles to stay ahead of them. Timed to the pulse of a Cliff Martinez score that recalls the Tangerine Dream soundtracks of the 80s Drive casts Gosling as a quiet inscrutable mystery man whose actions do all the talking for him. Refn sees him as the consummate professional in the mold of a Michael Mann hero but Sallis story adapted by Hossein Amini throws him into a situation where his dexterity and talent are met by overwhelming force and plain bad luck. The plotting involved in this titanic confrontation is dense but made to seem elementary and the major setpieces rip through the moody atmosphere like a thunderclap. Its retro genre heaven.

Drive (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Drive (R) Ryan Gosling cements his status as one of the best actors of his generation in this hypnotic violent thriller. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/14/2011 Editor rating 3.5 One mark of a bonafide movie star is that they command your attention even when they are doing and saying practically nothing. Clint Eastwood had that quality; Robert De Niro and Al Pacino did too. In Drive Ryan Gosling proves he deserves to be included in that rarified group. Playing a character known only as The Driver - a Hollywood stunt man by day a getaway driver-for-hire by night - Gosling doesnt say all that much but his eyes and demeanor do the talking for him. The role is an archetype - Sergio Leones Man With No Name transplanted to a contemporary big-city setting - but Gosling gives him shadings and depth. Hes a detached loner who excels at his job and he subscribes to the credo articulated by the thief De Niro played in Heat Never let anything into your life that you cant walk away from in thirty seconds flat when you feel the heat around the corner. The story of Drive centers on what happens when this solitary man forms an emotional attachment to someone else Irene (An Educations Carey Mulligan) the single mother who lives next door. Irene stirs something in the drivers closed heart. She is unavailable romantically Her sons father who sports the unlikely name of Standard (Oscar Isaac) is about to be released from prison and she remains faithful to him. But the bond between the Driver and Irene is so strong that none of that matters. He is satisfied simply by being a presence in her life spending time with her little boy - even helping her husband pull off a heist after he returns home and dangerous thugs immediately demand he repay an outstanding debt. Naturally the heist goes horribly wrong. Drive was directed by Nicolas Winding Refn (the Pusher trilogy Bronson) who gives the film a hypnotic quiet tone that mirrors the protagonists inner life. Adapted from James Sallis novel by Hossein Amini (The Wings of the Dove) the movie balances the pulpy action of pictures such as Point Blank with the sleek style of vintage Michael Mann (especially Thief and Miami Vice). The soundtrack is made up of Europop songs and synthesizer music Even the opening credits done in a hot-pink scrawl invoke the 1980s. The steely brooding mood constantly hints at danger and doom. The first half of the movie is largely bloodless The second half contains bursts of extreme astonishing gore including a scene set inside an elevator that imparts the biggest shock of any film thus far this year. Refn achieves something that is practically impossible to do in movies anymore He makes you dread violence - pushes and heightens it so far that youre horrified by it. The movie also contains a couple of expertly orchestrated car chases including the one that opens the film in which the Driver must elude the police chasing him in cars and helicopters. But what ultimately makes Drive so compelling is its characters - sketches given dimension and heft by a superb cast. Albert Brooks reveals an unexpected ability to radiate frightening menace as a crime kingpin capable of extreme acts. Bryan Cranston gives the role of the Drivers mentor and father figure a tragic undertow and Isaac brings tenderness and vulnerability to his hardened ex-con. But Drive ultimately belongs to Gosling whose performance is as memorable as his portrayal of a frustrated husband in Blue Valentine only this time he relies primarily on silence. Hes an unlikely tragic hero - the heart of an icy-cool movie that burns like fire. Cast Ryan Gosling Carey Mulligan Bryan Cranston Albert Brooks Oscar Isaac Ron Perlman.

At least Driver is the existential you-are-what-you-do name he goes by since the Los Angeles wheelman is so unforthcoming with personal information. By day Driver steers stunts for movie productions. By night he provides freelance getaway services for unsavory customers in need of transportation to and from the scenes of their armed heists. Drivers working wardrobe features a quilted white satin bomber jacket with a snazzy gold scorpion on the back. He enjoys the feel of a delicately notched toothpick between his lips while nimbly outmaneuvering cops on his tail. He never sweats hes so unflappable -- even when beating a man to a pulp. Among Goslings many star-making qualities is his nuanced mastery since The Believer of a facial expression of infinitely adaptable imperturbable sustained calm that can read as chilling or ardent hard or soft as the role demands. In Drive its difficult to tell whats going on behind those pale eyes -- a conundrum alternately intriguing and wearying especially when it comes to Drivers attraction to his apartment neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) the unlikely dame who will shape his fate. Irenes beauty and goodness (and her tenderness with her young son) move Driver to take outsize risks in ways he never has before with huge consequences. Thats quite a lot of power for a dimpled demure married mother and diner waitress played with recessive schoolgirl modesty by Mulligan with little barrettes in her hair. Mulligan is a delicate and lovely rising talent but shes confoundingly miscast in the role. With Gosling going all silent and mysterious when the two are together the pair never click. (The actor has much more chemistry with Breaking Bads great Bryan Cranston as Drivers mechanic/agent/manager.) Nevertheless because of his magnetic attraction to Irene and her son Driver is drawn into miles of trouble involving Irenes ex-con husband (Oscar Isaac) and a couple of thuggish gangsters played in a burst of brio by Ron Perlman (as one scary loud menace) and Albert Brooks (as one scary soft-spoken menace). Brooks Bernie is hiding a talent for shocking violence behind a smooth pleasant face a middle-aged bouffant of hair and a lulling voice; its a weird thrill to watch him do unspeakable things with a fork. Those more enchanted with Drive than I am will argue that opacity of character doesnt matter in a piece thats all about mood expressed through style rather than narrative logic expressed through believable chemistry. Certainly under the direction of Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn the boldly talented European genre auteur who made the Pusher trilogy the ultraviolent Bronson and Valhalla Rising Drive revels in sensory detail; its a visually and aurally edgy Euro-influenced American genre movie about the coolness of noir-influenced American genre movies about the coolness of driving -- especially in L.A. (The script is by British screenwriter Hossein Amini based on a novella by James Sallis.) And Refn is a confident master of arty action. The movie opens with an addictive getaway chase sequence through downtown streets shot low to the ground and on the fly motored by a burrowing pulse-quickening techno score by Johnny Jewel. Later Refn stages a classic speeding-and-brake-squealing variation (with Mad Mens Christina Hendricks dressed grubby and low-rent and shrieking in the backseat as a two-bit babe in on a scam). Later still he stages a satisfying prowling stalking showdown chase in L.A. darkness one of those beauts of a set piece in which headlights appear out of nowhere as a shadowy vehicle bears down on its prey. When talking about Drive Gosling readily explains that attracted to the script and jazzed by Refns previous work he personally sought out the director for the job. That kind of confident instinct when it comes to his own career is another one of the actors strengths He knows how to shift gears and take scenic routes expertly flexing his ever-increasing star power while pursuing the open road of creative freedom. And with Refn he has found a simpatico road partner. In Drive the actor and director look great with the wind in their hair.

Sure the gas mileage may be terrible and the engine unreliable but its such a smooth good-looking ride that youll put up with the annoyances. Drive Director Nicolas Winding Refn. Cast Ryan Gosling Carey Mulligan Albert Brooks Bryan Cranston Oscar Isaac. Rating R for strong violence language and nudity. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb In the film Ryan Gosling plays a character whose name is never revealed to the audience; in the end credits he is identified simply as ""Driver."" By day he works as a stuntman in films; at night he is a driver-for-hire who provides the getaway vehicle for various criminals. Interview Drive director Refn Things get complicated when he develops a quietly flirtatious relationship with Irene (Carey Mulligan) the rather blah woman who lives next door with her son Benicio (Kaden Leos). Shes not exactly a single mom; the boys dad the oddly named Standard Gabriel (Oscar Isaac) is in prison. After Standard gets released he needs help pulling off a big pawnshop robbery; no surprise who winds up driving the getaway car. In typical noir style the heist goes wrong and soon our driver is trying to wrangle his way out of a deadly situation while making sure Irene and the kid remain safe. Throw in Albert Brooks playing against type as a vicious crime lord; Bryan Cranston as a seedy pal of the drivers; and Ron Perlman as a Jewish gangster who operates out of a pizzeria; and youve got a colorful cast of characters threatening to steal the picture away at any minute. Written by Hossein Amini from a book by James Sallis the caper is presented in straightforward fashion. If anything it is almost too straightforward. There are no surprising revelations; instead its like the plot and characters simply fall together. Its all too neat; someone like John Sayles (""Lone Star"") could have linked these elements in a far more compelling way. Nicolas Winding Refn a Danish filmmaker who spent his formative years in New York directs. That Euro-American upbringing could help explain his style which is cool distant and riveting even while he embraces conventional Hollywood traditions. The plot is unadulterated pulp but Refns deliberately icy style gives it a sleek contemporary edge. The violence is wildly amped up almost reaching cartoonish proportions in some sequences even though its hard to get terribly involved in the plot machinations. The movies throbbing synthesizer-driven score by Cliff Martinez adds to the overall chill even as it recalls ""To Live and Die in L.A."" Refns style-over-substance mantra obviously extends to the films star. Gosling plays the role as a stoic rather silent anti-hero. The character doesnt say a lot; literally he doesnt have a lot a dialogue. At times that works to his advantage and Gosling suggests there is stuff going on beyond the silence. At other moments - particularly in the beginning - you get the feeling the actor has nothing happening past the cool poses an ever-present toothpick and the battered bomber jacket he wears throughout the film.

"Movie Review ""Drive"" | Movie Nation Movie Nation Filmgoing movie loving and a good argument. On a good day. Skip to content - Movie Review ""Straw Dogs"" Movie Review ""Kevin Hart Laugh at My Pain"" - Movie Review ""Drive"" Posted on January 7 2013      by rogerinorlando If you want to make your getaway you need to play it cool. No squealing tires. No panic at the first sign of the police. You need to stick to the speed limit. You need to know when to pull over behind a truck turn off your lights and wait for the po-po to pass you by. Or you need to hire ""the kid"" a guy who knows those things. Ryan Gosling oozes Steve McQueen cool in ""Drive"" a lean pulsating thriller about a mechanic and part-time movie stunt-driver who moonlights as a ""wheelman"" the fellow who can pick you up take you to your robbery and get you out of there before the cops catch you. He is the guy who knows that ""there are a hundred thousand streets in this city"" the guy who knows how long a police helicopter will be able to commit to a search for a getaway car what streets will be darkest what public event will be letting out just in time for him to ditch the car and just stroll away with the crowds. Gosling (""Crazy Stupid Love"") suggests a sort of blue collar cunning here. Hes probably seen a few heist movies a few car pictures. He builds cars works on them and drives with precise abandon when the movie stunt hes asked to do calls for it. He could be a stock car driver if his boss and partner in crime (Bryan Cranston) has his way. But in the meantime hes got this other gig -- and a very precise set of rules about method of payment and the window of time hell be at the scene of the crime  -- ""five minutes"" he says. And he lashes his watch to the steering wheel to show hes serious. ""I dont sit in. I dont carry a gun. I drive."" Carey Mulligan (""Wall Street 2) is ""the girl."" The driver takes the toothpick thats always in his mouth out and gets this goofy grin every time he sees her and her little boy. And he finds something noble to do when her husband gets out of prison and needs help with a job hes been blackmailed into pulling. Albert Brooks and the great Ron Perlman perfectly embody lowlifes just slightly higher on the underworld food chain in Nicolas Winding Refns film of the James Sallis novel. Each is dangerous. One at least seems reasonable. And thats the one you worry about. Refn who did the searing British prison picture ""Bronson"" as a Tom Hardy tour de force has created the quietest car picture ever. The dialogue is spare with deadpan stares and meaningful glances developing the relationships. The silences muted chases scored with understated music build tension. We know theres a ""Bullitt"" moment coming a violent and noisy reckoning. There are no cops hot on the trail of the criminals just double dealing and double-crossing and blood and secret sides to every personality. This mild-mannered driver is capable of something. We feel it long before we see it. Refn and Gosling are planning to team up for future movies and based on what we see in ""Drive"" thats a good thing. The minimal dialogue does lead to a few too many fussy/busy ""actorly"" moments. But they have collaborated on a car picture that unnerves us with its idling quiet and then pins our ears back when they stomp the accelerator. MPAA Rating R for strong brutal bloody violence language and some nudity. Cast Ryan Gosling Carey Mulligan Brayn Cranston Albert Brooks Ron Perlman Oscar Isaac. Credits Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn script by Hossein Amini based on a James Sallis novel. A FilmDistrict release.  Running time 140 Share thisTwitterFacebookLike thisLike Loading...

Hoberman Ryan Gosling at the Wheel in the Retro Thrill Ride Drive Wednesday September 14 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Ryan Gosling drives his vehicle.Richard Foreman A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - As stripped-down and propulsive as its robotic title Drive is the most ""American"" movie yet by Danish genre director Nicolas Winding Refn. The film for which Refn was named best director last May in Cannes is a sleek tense piece of work that as a vehicle for Ryan Gosling has a kind of daredevil control swerving dangerously close to and abruptly away from self-parody.The plot could nearly be inscribed on the head of a pin A chivalrous loner participates in an armed robbery to help out the woman he loves; the deal turns out to be a setup and the body count explodes. As amply demonstrated by the Pusher trilogy (1996-2005) and Bronson (2008) Refn is primarily a stylist and this tale of a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as a hired wheelman (or is it vice versa?) and gets played for a patsy is a lovingly assembled streamlined pastiche of 80s movies and TV. The most obvious reference is Walter Hills schematic action flick The Driver This 1978 paean to professional cool in the person of Ryan ONeal more or less provides Drives title premise uninflected antihero and minimalist existentialism as well as its two-dimensional attitude.Drive is nominally set in the present day but the 40-year-old director elects to emphasize the retro--or rather to evoke the period of his adolescence synthesizing Miami Vices languid dissolves and neon-limned dive bars Blade Runners nocturnal skylines and floating overhead angles Top Guns slow dollies and MTV-friendly lyrical montage interludes. Time stands still The action is set to a near-subliminal LinnDrum and the soundtrack is awash in mournful exalted romantic techno-pop. (In his interviews Refn has suggested that Drives programmatically chaste love story between Goslings no-name character and Carey Mulligans single mom Irene is an eccentric remake of his personal teenage favorite Sixteen Candles.) The shabby apartment house where Goslings ""driver"" lives down the hall from the depressed yet sparkly Irene might be the Deep River apartment that serves as Isabella Rossellinis lair in Blue Velvet and the secondary casting has a definite 80s flavor. Reagan-era TVs noblest monster Ron Perlman appears as the movies crassest villain while Albert Brooks the periods most significant comic director plays a murderous money-lending ex-producer. ""I used to make movies in the 80s"" he tells the unresponsive Gosling whom he is looking to hire as his driver. ""Action films sexy stuff--one critic called them European."" (Brooks delivers this monologue so well it seems as if he wrote it.)Doling out his lines in an adenoidal whisper Gosling is an understated hero in the Eastwood-McQueen tradition--almost ridiculously so His trademark toothpick is a diminished equivalent of the raunchy cheroot Eastwood gnaws in his spaghetti westerns. Goslings is a totally reactive performance Whatever the provocation he waits a beat to respond. His silence (and friendly if fixed Mona Lisa smirk) trumps everyone elses bravado. (Compared to Goslings near-catatonic driver Mulligans shiny-eyed pixie is all manic overemotionalizing as if one of the androids in Blade Runner had been retooled for perk appeal.) Weirdly agreeable Goslings driver sincerely enjoys watching TV with Irenes adorable kid and is willing to undertake a dangerous job gratis to help out her husband (smoldering Oscar Isaac) newly returned from the slammer. The heist is the hinge. Let the mayhem begin.Its one of Drives jokes that over the course of the movie Goslings spiffy silver jacket (emblazoned with a totemic scorpion on the back) will be increasingly bloodstained. Refns most obvious break with the airbrushed 80s and clearest link to his own early films is the ultraviolent even gruesome splatter. (Mad Mens Christina Hendricks perambulates onto the scene just long enough to get her head blown off.) The Gosling character is not only a master of high-speed bumper cars but when riled also a near-lunatic killer who as up close and personal as the protagonist of Refns Bronson uses a hammer some steel-tipped footwear and his bare hands to take care of business.Both times Ive seen Drive audiences were audibly amused by Goslings outbursts. The violence is laughable not so much because it is excessive but because it so thoroughly pulverizes the drivers otherwise dent-proof facade. The gag even works twice (as does the movie). Refns protag attacks one baddie in a dressing room full of soigne strippers and stomps another to a pulp only minutes after the shy proposal he offers Irene. Gosling has the timing to carry it off but the professional here is Refn. This grind-house risibility is totally strategic--at once counterpoint to the movies old-school suspense and an antidote to its out-front sentimentality. Basically Drive is a song of courtly love and devotion among the automatons. Its a machine but it works. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

"Drive | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; drive ) Drive (United States 2011) September 13 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Perhaps Drive is an action movie for those who dont ordinarily like action movies. Its also an action movie for those who crave them like a drug. Employing unusual camera angles and a unique sense of style director Nicolas Winding Refn takes us on a journey that gets us to feel something for the characters while still receiving an adrenaline rush when the speedometer races into the red zone. The car chases in this movie are exciting but the best thing about Drive is that you dont know whats going to happen. Theres a sense that the lead character could end up six feet under and that adds an element of urgency to this movie that most in the genre are missing. Ryan Gosling is perhaps an unlikely candidate for an action movie star not only because hes a good actor (not necessarily a desirable quality for this sort of role) but because his skills are best utilized in dramas and low-key comedies. As it turns out however hes a good fit for Drive in which his inscrutable character credited only as ""Driver"" reveals little background and almost never engages in small talk. Is he autistic or merely an introvert? The movie doesnt much care. Often dialogue is used to build a character but Driver speaks so infrequently that it falls upon Goslings mannerisms and facial expressions to develop someone better realized than a cartoonish stick figure. His success elevates Drive. We become invested not only in the mans life but in the chaste innocent relationship that develops between Driver and his neighbor Irene who is played with a Cathy Rigby/girl-next-door sweetness by Carey Mulligan. The movie opens with an explosive pulse pounding prologue set to a throbbing score by composer Cliff Martinez. Driver does all sorts of jobs - works at a garage races drives movie stunt cars and provides ""transportation"" for criminals. Drive opens with a getaway and shows the meticulous planning that goes into one such operation. It includes a stopwatch a police band radio and some badass driving. The eight minute sequence could stand on its own as a short. Its the best part of a movie that is otherwise still very good. Driver lives in the moment. Hes not afraid of dying perhaps because he never really lives. He falls in love with his neighbor but shes married to a guy in prison and hes coming home soon. But ""soon"" is not today so Driver finds momentary happiness in becoming a surrogate husband and father for a few days. Meanwhile his friend and boss Shannon (Bryan Cranston) provides him with getaway vehicles and puts together a deal that will allow him to drive a souped-up car in races. Unfortunately to get the money for the car he has to turn to a couple of mob thugs - the refined Bernie (Albert Brooks) and the less-refined Nino (Ron Perlman). You know things arent going to go well with these two involved. Perhaps because were so used to seeing Brooks as a sadsack funny guy were more sympathetic to his character than we might be if Bernie was played by a more typical wise guy figure. Its effective casting because Brooks is believable. Ron Perlman enjoys chewing a little on his lines; Nino is from the Joe Pesci school of thugs - he shouts a lot and thinks violence isnt just the best way to solve problems; its the only way. One senses that Bernie has spent half his life cleaning up Ninos messes as a darkly comedic moment hints. Taciturn action heroes are nothing new. Arnold Schwarzenegger strode through many films without cracking a smile. The difference here is that Gosling is not muscle-bound and his silences say more than many characters dialogues. You can see his mind working as he chews on a toothpick and the half-smirk speaks volumes. He doesnt carry a gun but is capable of a shocking degree of violence. In fact the movie includes scenes worthy of Tarantino in terms of what they show and imply. Refn who strode to international recognition with Bronson which featured a stunning performance by Tom Hardy brings a European sense of style to Drive. From the beginning its clear this is not a standard-order action film. It takes its characters as seriously as its chases shootouts and fights. Neither aspect is short-changed and the music and cinematography are used to establish and sustain tone. This is a moody film with moments of understated dark humor and bleakness. Most importantly it shows that movies can generate a testosterone-and-adrenaline cocktail without requiring viewers to undergo a frontal lobotomy to appreciate the result.

Plus Hollywoods greatest (flawed) new female auteur. By David Edelstein Published Sep 11 2011 ShareThis Christina Hendricks miscast in Drive (pictured) charming in I Dont Know How She Does It.  (Photo Richard Foreman/Courtesy of FilmDistrict) September brings the higher trash like Nicolas Winding Refns Drive which is every bit as dumb as Augusts Conan the Barbarian but awash in neon-lit nightscapes and existential dread with killings so graphic that you cant entirely believe what youre gagging at. (Youll never have to ask Is that person dead?) The hero (Ryan Gosling) is called Driver because thats what he does and what he does is what he you know is. Driver opens the picture with a monologue that mixes cold facts (Theres a hundred thousand streets in this city) with coldly pragmatic edicts to the criminals he carries to and from their high-pressure L.A. heists. (I give you a five-minute window Anything happens a minute either side of that and youre on your own.) Driver is an anti-blowhard taciturn watchful holding a matchstick between his teeth the way he holds his emotions in check. But hes also one of Gods Loneliest Men. He needs someone to love to risk everything forto give him a Reason to Drive. Refn a Dane is the sort of man to take Hollywood action movies to the next slick amoral and unbelievably vicious level. In Drives production notes he says Im very interested in the dark side of heroism how that unstoppable drive and righteous adherence to a code above the average persons can shade into something that is quite psychotic. Right the dualitywe get it. But Refn doesnt recoil from that psychosis He digs its potential for splatter. The murders are what gore freaks call ultra-wet with the camera stationed happily in the middle of crimson showers. Without the extreme violence Drive would be a lifeless rehash of such self-consciously existential thrillers as Walter Hills The Driver and Michael Manns Thief instead of Oh shit oh God this is so friggin hard-core Give Refn points as a mechanic. Hes deft. In an early heist sequence Driver uses his knowledge of the urban maze to evade both cruisers and copters and its such a tight twisty piece of staging that you wait for Driver to show off his genius for geography again. But after that its all exploding heads and slashed throats. Why would Gosling a fascinatingly cerebral actor take a role so far inside his comfort zone? Does he long to strike action-icon posesto be the new Nic Cage? Hes sane enough to keep the movie from drifting into Cagean camp but considering where it does go thats a hollow victory. Drivers bare apartment is down the corridor from a pretty young mother (Carey Mulligan) and her lonely little boy who make Drivers (and the movies) sap rise and lead to some moist domestic montagesuntil the husband and father (Oscar Isaac) gets out of prison and takes back whats his. But the ex-con is in debt to thugs who threaten to kill his wife and son if he doesnt commit a robbery whereupon Driverwho has given up drivingis driven to make one last drive People will line up for Drive for a look at some of the hottest actors of the momentand see little indication of what made them hot. Mulligan brings nothing to her part but drab earnestness and Christina Hendricks (as a moll) looks as if she wandered onto the wrong set. Its fun to see Bryan Cranstoncloser every week to finding his inner psychopath in Breaking Bad from which Refn could learn much about mixing extreme violence and moral complexitygimp it up as Drivers sweet luckless mechanic. But the only surprising turn is by Albert Brooks as a shady businessman who plays his cards close to the vest. Theres something magical about this performance You can taste Brookss pleasure in not for once having to work so hard to open himself up and be crazily humiliatingly vulnerable. Now he can relax and stay inside himself and open other people upwith a straight razor. America has a new A-list auteuramazingly enough a screenwriter and even more amazingly given Hollywoods biases a woman. Aline Brosh McKennas films include The Devil Wears Prada 27 Dresses Morning Glory and now I Dont Know How She Does It. All are smart comedies centering on smart harried ambitious women who fight off obstacles thrown in their path by threatened males and often femalesbefore they realize in shame that theyre in danger of losing the humanity that separated them from their type A adversaries. McKenna has a gift for screwball dialogue She gets the connection between headlong rhythms and psychological desperation. The problem is that her screenplays have soft centers not female-squishy but Hollywood-squashy her heroines heroic assertions of independence coinciding with her own surrender to commercial conformity. In the context of so much wit the pandering is scary. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Goslings character - a stunt driver by day a getaway man by night - and his ambitious manager (Bryan Cranston) get involved with some bad people Albert Brooks playing a razor-wielding thug/movie producer and Ron Perlman as his nastier partner. True to its seventies genre roots the plot is enthusiastically pulpy with the hero compelled to protect a young mother (Carey Mulligan) while battling his enemies.

By Mike DAngelogemko May 20 2011 1152 AM Share Tweet Share Tweet Since yesterdays post Ive seen my two favorite films in this years Competition lineup and I think I can state with confidence that neither one has a chance in hell of winning the Palme dOr. Which is fine really. My taste is my own and these are unquestionably minor works likely to have very little lasting impact. They dont necessarily merit a big-deal award. But that doesnt mean they arent a hell of a lot of fun. In fact I can readily imagine a rabid cult following coalescing around Drive which looked at a distance like a contemporary remake of Walter Hills The Driver (its actually based on a recent novel by James Sallis) but turns out to play more like a hypothetical remake of The Driver from ca. 1984-87. Directed by Denmarks Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson) it stars Ryan Gosling as well The Driver (like Ryan ONeals character in the 72 film he has no name) an impossibly terse hunk of pure soulfulness who performs automotive stunts for Hollywood movies by day and drives getaway cars for criminals by night. So far so familiar but after a virtuoso opening sequence depicting a perfectly timed escape from the cops theres remarkably little driving in Drive; once The Driver forges an unspoken romance with a fetching neighbor (Carey Mulligan) in his apartment building the film scans their faces with such searching intensity that the film should arguably be titled Look. Needless to say theres a heist-gone-wrong which gets our hero in Dutch with 80s-style baddies played by Ron Perlman and -- in one of the greatest against-type casting coups in recent memory -- Albert Brooks who more or less torches his neurotic persona even while remaining recognizably ""himself."" But if the plot seems disposable and the relationships vaguely hollow Winding Refn and his superlative cast put it all across with an uncommon directness that seems to somehow transcend cliche even as if the film cheerfully replicates many of the schlockiest tropes of the generic 80s action flick. At least half a dozen scenes are burned into my memory for life including not one but two of the most jarring heartbreaking juxtapositions of tenderness and violence this side of classic Kitano. At its best its pure genre bliss. Grade B+ (but remember thats most peoples A-). Judging from my Twitter feed most folks here seem to agree that Drive is a winner. I expect a far more divisive response to This Must Be the Place the first English-language effort by Italys Paolo Sorrentino--and frankly Im not entirely sure how to articulate why I enjoyed it so much. Certainly a plot summary wont help Sean Penn of all people plays an androgynous former rock star named Cheyenne who travels the U.S. in full makeup searching for the fugitive Nazi who tormented his father at Auschwitz. But the glory of this movie is that it isnt really about its crazy plot or even its ludicrous protagonist (in whom Penn alternately restrained and manic locates a lovely undercurrent of melancholy). ""Well get to that"" a random character played by Harry Dean Stanton tells Cheyenne twice in about 30 seconds regarding two completely different subjects and the phrase amounts to a credo of sorts; its a film about digression as epiphany shot in a style that makes it seem as if Sorrentino is reinventing the world every few minutes. Theres something radically optimistic about the way that This Must Be the Place in keeping with its title (yes derived from the Talking Heads song; David Byrne appears and performs as himself) stubbornly refuses to close itself off to anything so that each newly introduced character or situation--in many cases each individual shot--seems to be the reason the movie was made. And yet at the same time everything seems ephemeral gone in an instant and that too feels strangely optimistic. Im a little troubled by the ending which struck me on a first viewing as both overly tidy and slightly reactionary but for the most part this goofy rebuke to the road movie kept me grinning. Grade B (leaning toward B+). If This Must Be the Place is a movie that doesnt especially care about its ludicrous plot Pedro Almodovars new film The Skin I Live In cares about nothing but its ludicrous plot. Which presents a bit of a challenge for anyone reviewing it as it would be cruel to reveal too much about what happens yet theres nothing much else to talk about -- except perhaps to note that the films subject matter reflects the lifelong preoccupations of a gay film director obsessed with women. Antonio Banderas working with Almodovar for the first time since 1990s Tie Me Up Tie Me Down plays a brilliant but deranged surgeon who maintains an operating room on his private estate and performs regular procedures on a beautiful young woman (Elena Anaya). All we know at the outset is that Banderas has created an unusually strong artificial skin driven to the task after his wife died in a fire and that the young woman seems to be held captive in his house with the complicity of his housekeeper (Marisa Paredes). And thats really all I ought to tell you because the only real charge this movie offers is the gradual and increasingly fucked-up reveal of whats actually going on. (If you have a guess based on the above description trust me Nope.) Theres no emotional subtext to the outre scenario no sense that this lunacy reflects feelings too strong to be contained by an ordinary narrative; at the precise instant that the film threatens to address something real it promptly ends. If you took a Weekly World News cover story and tried to reverse-engineer a screenplay from the headline it might look something like The Skin I Live In. I wanted more. Grade C+ Finally I must apologize regarding Hong Sang-soos The Day He Arrives one of my most anticipated films. At the risk of joining Lars von Trier as persona non grata I confess that I as a white dude sometimes have trouble distinguishing faces in Asian movies--especially Hongs movies for some reason. (A pop-psych theory Ive read This is not really racism per se but just an example of the brain economizing. If you see relatively few Asians in your daily life then theres no need--from the perspective of neurological processing power--for you to properly ""learn"" the nuances of their faces since the brain can just file each one away under ""Asian"" using the most obvious signifiers--epicanthic fold etc. And so you dont. Dunno if its true but it makes me feel better.) So when an actress reappeared in Hongs new movie in which I gather may or may not be a different role the intended ambiguity sailed right over my head--along with the movies central conceit judging from reviews. I just plain didnt recognize her thought it was a different person entirely. Consequently I just dont feel like I can evaluate this movie with any confidence. Its very Hong I can tell you that. And shot in black-and-white. Sorry folks.

Starring Ryan Gosling as a Hollywood stuntman/getaway driver ""Drive"" takes the tired heist-gone-bad genre out for a spin delivering fresh guilty-pleasure thrills in the process. Serious-actor cast plus pics selection in competition at Cannes should lend prestige to the Sept. 16 domestic release. After serving up a pair of intense emotionally draining perfs in ""Blue Valentine"" and ""All Good Things"" Gosling swings to the other extreme with ""Drive"" channeling Alain Delons cipher-like hitman from ""Le Samourai"" -- a cool-as-ice model that conveniently allows screenwriters to forgo the requisite backstory when creating compassionate-criminal types. The key to such one-dimensional characters is that they live by a rigorous code of conduct and Goslings unnamed Driver is no exception. By sticking to his own set of rules Driver excels at his job which amounts to evading cops by night only to play one the following day on set. Gosling is chillingly stoic in either context hardly breaking a sweat in the films buckle-up beginning scene. In fact thesp betrays no emotion until the third time his character encounters pretty next-door neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos). Only then does Driver crack a smile offering the pair a high-speed tour along the Los Angeles Rivers cement culverts. Romantic as their outing proves Irene isnt exactly single. Benicios dad Standard (Oscar Isaac) comes home from jail a week later enlisting Driver in a ploy that involves stealing a million dollars for mostly honorable reasons. Things go bad blood and brains are splattered about with sickening glee and Driver finds his chivalrous intentions put to the test as those behind the botched heist threaten to harm Irene and Benicio whose protection evidently matters enough to Driver that hes willing to risk his life. Adapted by Hossein Amini (best known for ""The Wings of the Dove"" and other highbrow literary fare) from James Sallis Los Angeles-set novel ""Drive"" doesnt quite know how to handle the character vacuum at its core but compensates by surrounding its protag with a colorful supporting ensemble. Theres Bryan Cranston (""Breaking Bad"") as the surrogate father who supplies Driver his wheels; Ron Perlman as a ruthless big shot running schemes from his strip-mall pizza joint; and Albert Brooks cast deliciously against type as the aforementioned producer-turned-crime-boss. On the female front vampy ""Mad Men"" redhead Christina Hendricks makes an all-too-brief appearance while Mulligan though undeniably sweet seems too wholesome for what would typically be the pics femme-fatale role. Like Quentin Tarantino Refn is an exploitation-movie junkie so his cinematic references mirror 70s and 80s cult faves like ""To Live and Die in L.A."" more than the spare unforgiving noir novels and films Sallis had in mind. Such questionable influences can be felt from the neon-bright opening credits to Refns retro music choices -- a mix of tension-ratcheting synthesizer tones and catchy club anthems -- that collectively give the film its consistent tone. Whereas most muscle-car action pics are visually and narratively flat however ""Drive"" displays stunning style. With its spare storytelling economy this is the sort of film that would launch a career if only it were Refns debut rather than his eighth feature. Still it does mark Refns first for-hire Hollywood production giving him the chance to work with the likes of Steven Soderberghs go-to composer Cliff Martinez and Bryan Singers trusted d.p. Newton Thomas Sigel whose high-contrast widescreen framing puts a harsh new edge on east L.A. locations. Among a host of impressive setpieces the most remarkable is a white-knuckle car chase that once again reminds how scarce fancy driving has gotten onscreen deservedly earning a round of enthusiastic applause from the Cannes crowd. (Though dozens of drivers are credited Gosling did a number of his own stunts.) Still its surprising that a film called ""Drive"" doesnt feature more driving. Aminis script barely explores Drivers status as a stuntman offering only a thin connection between his high-stakes day job and equally dangerous private life (in the form of a prosthetic mask he dons in the films brutal score-settling finale). What the character lacks in psychology he compensates for through action and iconic costuming. Come Halloween dont be surprised to see fans dressed as Driver wearing a white satin racing jacket with a giant gold scorpion on the back. ""Drive"" is fetishistic like that reveling in such details as the growl of a GTO engine or the creak of Goslings gloves and should go a long way to boost the profiles of both its director and star.
