For such a formulaic film Blood Diamond does have one very nice surprise. (Plus Leos good in it.) By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis (Photo Brigitte Lacombe ) It will be fun to see which stars are willful and/or clueless enough to wear diamonds to this years Academy Awards if the political action melodrama Blood Diamondabout the carnage surrounding the mining of the gemstones in Sierra Leoneracks up a lot of nominations. Forgive me for opening on such a superficial note but the truest measure of the worth of the moviewhich is both excitingly well made and dispiritingly formulaicwill be in what trickles down whether strong box office plus Leonardo DiCaprios earnest proclamations on Oprah plus the opportunistic shame of Hollywood goddesses can disrupt Tad and Suzys engagement-ring expedition and Dads anniversary surprise for Mom. People back home wouldnt buy a diamond if they knew it cost someone a hand avers the films crusading journalist (Jennifer Connelly) and the director Edward Zwick is not above supplying the people back home with a close-up of that hand getting whacked off by a machete. Zwick is now something of a biracial political-conversion melodrama specialist having presided over the much weirder The Last Samuraiin which the guilt-racked Indian slayer Tom Cruise was dispatched to Japan to wipe out another indigenous culture but found instead his Inner Buddha. In Blood Diamond the sinner ripe for enlightenment is Danny Archer (DiCaprio) a native of Zimbabwe who makes a point of referring to the country by its old colonial name Rhodesia. A former Angolan mercenary Danny now (the film is set in the late nineties) smuggles Sierra Leone diamonds into Liberia in return for guns and rocket-launchers which go to the rebel army (the RUF)the army weve seen mowing down women and children training young boys to be rapists and mass murderers and conscripting hardier men to work in the diamond fields. One of these conscriptees is the Mende fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who findsand manages to hidea whopper of a diamond before somehow (dont ask) landing in jail across from Danny who somehow (dont ask) gets wind of the potential mother lode. The rest of Blood Diamond centers on the odyssey of these two very different Africans the sleazy white man desperate for a big score to square his debts with a mercenary colonel (Arnold Vosloo who speaks with the clipped cadences of Christopher Lees Count Dracula) and the Solomonic black man determined to find his teenage son (Caruso Kuypers) before a sadistic RUF captain (David Harewood) with an eye patch turns him into a mindless raping and pillaging machine. Zwick and his screenwriter Charles Leavitt are conscientious about stamping out the mismatched-buddy-movie fires when they flare up. They keep Danny a cad and Solomon resentful over his countrys long history of exploitation for its natural resources. Connellys Maddy Bowen comes along to pump Danny for the details of his smuggling operation and just as important in the scheme of things the source of his hurtanything to combat his self-serving fatalism. Given that the movie doesnt have a single narrative surpriseyou always know where its going and why commercially speaking its going thereits amazing how good Blood Diamond is. I guess thats the surprise. Amid the predictable picturesque sunrises and sunsets are some extraordinary chases through tropical forests with huge radiantly green leaves (the cinematographer is Eduardo Serra); the misery in the shantytowns and refugees camps is tactile; and the scenes in which the RUF captain works to purge Solomons son of his humanity are chilling. Hounsou is a bit totemic for my taste but the moments in which he rages at the loss of his son have a preternatural power and Connelly is such a smart sane unhistrionic actress that she almost disguises the fact that her character is a wheeze. Its DiCaprios movie though. More and more were getting the measure of him When he plays earnest male ingenues as in The Beach Gangs of New York and The Departed his face looks heavy and slack and there doesnt seem to be much going on behind that big brow. But when hes cock of the walk hes a star. His Danny is in the mode of his characters in Titanic and Catch Me If You Cana wiry resourceful con artist whos most fully alive when hes backed into corners and must invent a way out. His lightness here keeps Blood Diamond from getting weighed down by the horror of its subject. Whether it should be weighed downthats another matter. As I watched the senseless brutality the shooting of mothers and children as they fled I was torn up divided. I thought Why do I need to see this? Then I thought This happened in Sierra Leone and is still happening in parts of AfricaI need to see it. Then I thought If I need to see it I need to see more than a sneering villain with an eye patch. I need to understand how this manand the people under himbecome the monsters they are. Thats what you dont get in Blood Diamond what you dont get in even the best melodrama insight. After we stop buying blood diamonds from conflict zones what then? 1 2 Next Share this story...

"The Holiday and Blood Diamond reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Holiday and Blood Diamond reviewed. The Holiday and Blood Diamond reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 8 2006 619 PM Trading Spaces Home-swapping in Holiday. Plus Leo DiCaprios turn in Blood Diamond. By Dana Stevens Kate Winslet and Jack Black in The Holiday The Holiday (Columbia Pictures) is built around a premise so friendly it may inspire a new subgenre the house-swap rom-com. Kate Winslet plays Iris a British journalist whos trying to get over a toxic affair. Iris wants to exchange her storybook cottage in the Cotswolds for just about anyplace on earth thats far away. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is the owner of an L.A. movie-trailer company (in a shrill running joke she imagines her own life narrated in trailer-ese) whos just dumped her two-timing boyfriend and is also fantasizing about escape. In a spontaneous IM chat on a home-exchange site they agree to trade houses for the Christmas holiday. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Thus begins an overlong but strangely lulling idyll during which Amanda will fall for Iris dreamboat brother Graham (Jude Law) while Iris slowly comes around to the charm of a film composer named Miles (Jack Black.) In a subplot Iris herself charms the pants off her next-door neighbor an old Hollywood screenwriter played by an unrecognizable but endearing Eli Wallach--yes thats Tuco from The Good the Bad and the Ugly. Advertisement The Holiday hits all its expected marks--female empowerment impromptu dinner parties learning to trust again--with rhythmic predictability. Everything has a bourgeois glaze of consumer pleasantness around it--those scholars struggling to define what ""whiteness"" means should look at some Nancy Meyers movies. But its far less sickly than plenty of yuletide offerings last years The Family Stone being one shudder-worthy example. Meyers films are slackly paced yes--The Holiday could lose at least 20 minutes--but in a way that feels somehow generous and roomy. The characters pace and putter around in the story like animals building their nests and by the time they finally settle down with their mates we have a grudging affection for them. Like Diane Keatons character in Somethings Gotta Give Winslets Iris is a bumbling self-pitying mess but underneath you just know she has romantic-heroine potential--what Arthur the screenwriter a fan of Barbara Stanwyck and Irene Dunne calls ""gumption."" Though its not clear whether Cameron Diaz is adept at playing a brittle self-involved Hollywood type or simply is that type she makes Amanda convincing if not altogether likeable. The strangest casting choice of course is Jack Black as an unironic romantic lead (or at least sub-lead; Law and Diaz are clearly the A couple to Black and Winslets schlubbier B.) With a lesser partner Blacks trademark mania reined in as it is here might have felt out of place. But Winslet is so present as an actress that she gives Blacks nuttiness room to resonate. A late scene in which they improvise a nonsense song together at a keyboard captures the goofy energy of a new crush. As much as anything The Holiday is a movie about how changing your location can change your life. And during the season when the ""home for the holidays"" theme is drummed into our heads (even as many of us long to be anywhere but around the hearth with our annoying loved ones) theres something to be said for the notion of travel as a curative not to mention Christmas Eve alone with a plate of fettucine. Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou in Blood Diamond Advertisement With his role in Blood Diamond (Warner Bros.) Im finally starting to get Leonardo DiCaprio. As an earnest romantic hero (Titanic Romeo+Juliet) hes utterly unconvincing and somewhat slappable but as an amoral rogue or a spoiled despot (Catch Me If You Can The Man in the Iron Mask) hes got something. Leos appeal derives precisely from his truculent brattiness; I love the oft-cited biographical detail that he was ""nearly"" kicked off the childrens TV show Romper Room at age 5 for bad behavior. Nearly Danny Archer the Zimbabwean mercenary DiCaprio plays in Blood Diamond would have been kicked off Romper Room for good. Hes an unreconstructed cynic a smuggler a thief and possibly a racist (though to this movies credit it acknowledges that the dialogue between races in Africa sounds very different from the one here). DiCaprio grabs this juicy antihero role and heads for the end zone right down to an accent that though I cant vouch for its authenticity sounds thoroughly unaffected and consistent. (Unlike say Tim Robbins in the recent To Catch a Fire.) Unfortunately one of Blood Diamondsmultiple problems is that it feels too much like a vehicle for DiCaprio. In its focus on the swaggering Danny the film gives short shrift to his black African counterpart Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou who must be getting tired of playing the noble-African role after In America and Amistad). Captured by a brutal insurgent group in his native Sierra Leone Solomon is forced to dig for diamonds. He finds a huge rare pink stone on his first day out and manages to bury it in a secret place. The rest of the film is about the deals everyone wants to cut over this rock. In exchange for the diamonds location Danny agrees to help Solomon track down his missing son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers). The rebels who are training Dia as a child soldier are willing to kill pretty much anyone to get the stone sell it on the international market and buy arms for their civil war. Jennifer Connelly whose extreme physical beauty is approaching an actionable offense costars as Maddy Bowen an investigative journalist for the dull-sounding periodical Vital Affairs. She and Leo debate cynicism and idealism while dancing in bars and eventually he agrees to be her source for an expose of the diamond trade. Blood Diamond is a by-the-numbers message picture to be sure. When in dire need of some exposition on the international jewel trade its not above cutting to a discussion around a G8 conference table. But the director Edward Zwick is craftsman enough that the pace never slackens the chase scenes thrill and the battle scenes sicken. And if it makes viewers think twice about buying their sweethearts that hard-won hunk of ice for Christmas so much the better.

After the first few impalements amputations rapes eviscerations and beheadings I thought Mel Gibsons Yucatec-language action adventure set in the waning days of the Maya civilization might well be the most obsessively graphically violent film I had ever seen. By the end I felt sure it was the most obsessively graphically violent film Id ever seen but equally sure that ""Apocalypto"" is a visionary work with its own wild integrity. And absolutely positively convinced that seeing it once is enough for one lifetime. ENLARGE However Mr. Gibson may present himself in public these days hes a singular presence in contemporary American films; no one else is making movies like ""Apocalypto"" or ""The Passion of the Christ"" let alone paying for them out of personal bank accounts. Yet hes also rooted in the Hollywood tradition of flamboyant obsessive-compulsives -- Griffith Von Stroheim De Mille -- who combined the power of primitivist themes with all the razzle-dazzle technique at their command. The technique deployed in ""Apocalypto"" is elegant though that shouldnt be surprising given the superb craftsmanship of ""The Passion of the Christ."" Dean Semlers cinematography Tom Sanderss production design Roberto Bonellis art direction John Wrights editing James Horners music and Mayes C. Rubeos costumes all illuminate the story of one man and his family trying to survive in the ghastly chaos of a pre-Columbian society thats grown rotten to the core. (If the screenplay by Mr. Gibson and Farhad Safinia suggests that any other civilizations are rotting its as the writers intended.) In the department of razzling and dazzling ""Apocalypto"" embraces an assortment of consecrated action tropes and reliable cliches dating back to the silent cinema -- brilliant chases spectacular leaps and falls a creepy seeress women and children in constant jeopardy waters rising quicksand gurgling lives saved by a solar eclipse cliff-hangers on the edge of sandy cliffs. Due to the absence of ice floes off the Yucatan theres no Mayan equivalent of Lillian Gish. The hero Jaguar Paw is played by Rudy Youngblood a Native American artist and musician making his acting debut. In a production that boasts a cast ""made up entirely of indigenous peoples from the Americas"" Mr. Youngblood builds on his indigenousness with a bag of shrewd actors tricks that date back to early Marlon Brando. The impressive result is a protagonist who keeps our disbelief more or less suspended and that is no easy feat. At the outset Jaguar Paw his pregnant wife and their young son are among the peaceful jovial and poetic residents of a village whose worst plague is a mother-in-law reminiscent of the one played last year by Jane Fonda. When the village is invaded by stone-age body-builders with bad teeth but great costumes Jaguar Paw is taken prisoner made a slave (all the slaves are slathered in ""Braveheart"" blue) and forced to endure several successive hells while making good on a promise to his wife that he will return. The film takes that promise solemnly. Its a moral fable about the primacy of the family and other things as well strong fathers; overcoming fear; standing up to corrupt authority (Mad Max careering even farther off-road); the need for new beginnings the sanctity of the land and again not surprisingly given the radical fundamentalism of Mel Gibsons religious beliefs a tacit rejection of the Christianity that arrives by Spanish galleon on the Yucatan shore. As one whose Yucatec-language skills are wanting I cant pass judgment on the quality of the dialogue or on the accuracy of the subtitles which include the memorable phrase ""We must not let this man make feet from us."" I will tell you though that by the time Jaguar Paws journey was over I could not wait to make feet from the theater. Days of Glory ENLARGE From left to right Jamel Debbouze Sami Bouajila and Roschdy Zem portray soldiers in Days of Glory. ""Days of Glory"" is the forgettable English title of ""Indigenes"" an unforgettable drama about Algerian soldiers fighting in the French army in World War II. (Its Algerias Oscar entry for best foreign film and would have my vote if I were an Academy member.) The French title translates to ""natives"" but with a strongly ironic connotation. The soldiers in question dust-poor volunteers who had never set foot on French soil fought valiantly to liberate the motherland from Nazi rule. Yet their fellow French soldiers called them ""natives"" or worse used them as cannon fodder and saw them as subhuman scum. Before and after anything else ""Days of Glory"" which was directed by Rachid Bouchareb from a script by Olivier Lorelle is a splendid war movie. The combat sequences are harrowing -- all the more so for the directors spare sharp-eyed style -- and the performances are phenomenally fine Jamel Debbouzes nebbishy Said an unswervingly loyal private with a missing hand and buried passions; Roschdy Zems Messaoud hopelessly in love with a sweet-spirited French woman; Bernard Blancans Sgt. Martinez caught between his North African troops and his French superiors and Sami Bouajilas Abdelkader a proto-intellectual with a burning sense of justice. More than that though -- as if a film needed to be more than that -- ""Days of Glory"" is a history lesson that has already moved one French mountain. When it opened in Paris in September audiences learned from the movies end titles and Web site that army pensions being paid to North African veterans or their widows were only a fraction of those still going to their counterparts in metropolitan France. After a screening at the Elysee Palace the French president Jacques Chirac was so moved by the film that he ordered the pensions to be equalized as ""an act of justice."" For audiences anywhere the film helps to clarify the colonial roots of the growing conflict between Europe and its Muslim populations. It does so with remarkably little didacticism steadfast humanity and a minimum of sentimentality which is confined to an ending reminiscent of ""Saving Private Ryan."" Until then its easy to imagine one of the survivors the eloquent young firebrand Abdelkader living a thwarted life of self-despair in postwar France (like the grizzled old Algerian in ""Cache"") or just as plausibly becoming a radicalized anti-French fighter like the Muslim ideologues in ""The Battle of Algiers."" The ending might have been more provocative if it had been less specific though the specificity has a dramatic purpose. Still Abdelkaders fate like the film as a whole rings resoundingly true. He does what he does because of who he has always been. Blood Diamond What a great year this is turning out to be for Leonardo DiCaprio. A few months ago he was nothing less than sensational as a desperate undercover cop in Martin Scorseses ""The Departed."" Now hes the beating heart and soul of ""Blood Diamond"" Edward Zwicks ambitious but ultimately unmanageable amalgam of action romance civil war and social chaos in the Sierra Leone of the 1990s. Mr. DiCaprio plays Danny Archer a former mercenary from Zimbabwe whos become a diamond smuggler. Djimon Hounsou is Solomon Vandy a fisherman who finds a diamond much bigger than the Ritz. From that confluence of character and circumstance one might expect a thriller with existential overtones a sort of ""Treasure of Sierra Leone."" Or failing that a romantic adventure capitalizing on the presence of Jennifer Connollys journalist Maddy Bowen in the tradition of ""The Year of Living Dangerously."" Yet nothing so simple seems to have crossed the minds of Mr. Zwick or his screenwriter Charles Leavitt. They have laid on enough plot elements to fill a periodic table the mistrust and mutual need binding Danny and Solomon; Maddys investigation of the diamond trade; the mistrust and mutual need plus plenty of sexiness binding Danny and Maddy; the horrifying (and vividly dramatic) depredations of child soldiers and Solomons need to find one of those lethal children who happens to be his lost son. Any one of these elements would have made a fascinating movie -- especially the shocking assertions about the human toll of the diamond trade. Thanks to the redundancy though ""Blood Diamond"" is dramatically diffuse and at least 30 minutes too long. Thanks to Mr. DiCaprios raffishly dashing soldier of fortune the movie is worth watching all the same. The Holiday One bad sign of many in Nancy Meyerss ""The Holiday"" is how much the movies home-swapping women played by Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz talk to themselves. Its not that theyre crazy though both are improbably crazed by unrequited love (which Lorenz Hart warned in a trenchant lyric is a bore). Its that theyre stuck with the movies structure which uses a home-exchange Web site to send Ms. Diazs unhappy Amanda from California where she produces movie trailers to an empty cottage in the Cotswolds and Ms. Winslets unhappy Iris from England where she writes for a newspaper to an empty mansion in Los Angeles. Eventually both women find conversational partners followed by happiness but here again the story goes on at untoward length. In what was clearly designed to be a chick flick the on-screen chicks work hard at being endearing while Jude Law as Amandas more than conversational partner charms everyone effortlessly and gets the best lines.    DVD TIP Mel Gibson gave a startling performance as Jerry Fletcher a seemingly paranoid New York cabbie in an exciting thriller called ""Conspiracy Theory"" (1997). Yet the movie written by Brian Helgeland and directed by Richard Donner (who directed all three of Mr. Gibsons ""Lethal Weapon"" films) was a flop. Audiences still doted on Mel Gibson then and they didnt want to see him act crazy.

Romancing the enormous conflict diamond 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Blood Diamond Action adventure. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly. Directed by Edward Zwick. (R. 143 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Being nice about ""Blood Diamond"" would mean saying almost everything about it except the most important thing that it is brain-fryingly boring. Here we have a film with all the gravitas humane purpose and epic length of a classic but with a lukewarm uninvolving and slow-moving story and with characters whose every action is predictable from at least an hour off. Director Edward Zwick tried to make a great movie but somewhere in the process he forgot to make a good one. [Podcast Mick LaSalle discusses ""Blood Diamond.""] In some ways theres really nothing worse than a mediocre picture made with the intent of winning an Oscar. Just the form itself invites bloat. But when theres nothing to fill the bloat when the whole enterprise looks like an earnest mistake from the first 15 minutes the effect is -- not excruciating not painful -- but physically and spiritually exhausting. Its the experience of watching waste with part of that waste being 143 minutes of your own life. The subject here are ""conflict diamonds"" that get smuggled out of Sierra Leone by rebel leaders who use the money to wage war against the government and against the average citizens that live on top of the rich diamond mining areas. In scenes that will recall ""Hotel Rwanda"" the rebels ride into town in their trucks and just start massacring people. In fact the set-up is not unlike that of ""Apocalypto"" which also opens today Djimon Hounsou is Solomon a nice guy who manages to get his wife and daughter out of firing range before he gets forced into slavery mining diamonds for the rebels. Meanwhile living well off the strife and misery of the African peasantry is a blithe young fellow Danny a smuggler from Zimbabwe -- he calls it Rhodesia. The role requires that Leonardo DiCaprio speak in a Zimbabwean accent that he never quite gets right. He has the lyrics knows the tune but he just doesnt have the music. Its rare that an entire scene goes by without his saying something that jars the ear. So in casting terms DiCaprio is not optimal; nor is Jennifer Connelly who plays a war correspondent. Few moments in Connellys career ring as false as her impassioned speech about journalism. But both are decorative and decorative isnt bad. DiCaprio has come into a nice look in his 30s -- he looks a sneaky version of Jack Kennedys older brother Joe. With Connelly theres always the question of which one of her incarnations will show up -- the gaunt boyish-faced Connelly or the lush adequately fed Connelly. Here she has had all the calories necessary (a few more wouldnt have hurt) and looks more beautiful than ever which in her case is saying something. However theyre not exactly at the center of the film. The main focus is on Solomon who finds a large diamond buries it for safekeeping and manages to escape slavery. But how will he find his family and retrieve the diamond? And theres yet another complication Solomons nice little son has been captured by the rebels and converted into a heartless blood-thirsty soldier. Thats not good. Objectively one can see why Zwick and screenwriter Charles Leavitt might be interested in the phenomenon of African child soldiers. Its an ongoing horror and Zwick invests time to show how the brainwashing and initiations take place. But before the movie is half over the film has introduced so many story elements that theyre like planes stacked above an airport waiting one by one to land. In terms of sheer dullness the experience of watching ""Blood Diamond"" is not unlike being on one of those planes except that a movie is dark while on the plane theres enough light to read something. The lack of suspense becomes enervating. The father-son element is overplayed and easy to anticipate and serves to drag out the search for the diamond the only real source of drama. Everything else is a distraction. For example does it really make sense to hang suspense on the question of whether Leo will turn out to be a nice guy in the end? Is there anyone reading this who doesnt already know? Connelly finds her way to an easy rapport with DiCaprio but her role amounts to little and seems there mainly because the movie needs a girl in it. (It sure does.) Some might argue that the Connelly role serves as the films conscience. That may have been the intent but as with a lot of things intended with ""Blood Diamond"" the audience isnt made to feel it. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence.

The movie pitches us into the midst of a barbaric civil war in Sierra Leone in 1999 in which the profits from illegal or ""conflict"" diamonds sold on the black market to reputable European companies (a tiny splinter of the diamond trade) are used to fund arms on both sides of the war.A rare pink diamond coveted by all is the ""MacGuffin"" that sets the plot in motion. Its found and secretly buried by Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) a Mende fisherman rounded up by marauding rebel forces and forced to work in their mines. They have also kidnapped his 14-year-old son to join their legions of brainwashed doped-up child soldiers and Solomon is counting on the money his diamond will bring to save his boy. The gem is equally coveted by diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) a tough amoral ex-mercenary from Zimbabwe for whom the diamond represents his ticket out of war-torn Africa. He promises to help Solomon rescue his family for a cut of the profits but he in turn needs the help of American journalist Maddy Brown (Jennifer Connelly). What she wants is Archers help in exposing the complicity of the Western diamond trade in the exploitation of the Third World. Their quest to retrieve the prize fuels the movies nonstop action.Fast-moving and brutally entertaining Zwicks movie from a Charles Leavitt screenplay is undeniably gripping but the by-the-book Hollywood melodrama (Will the cynical Archer discover a conscience? Will the aggressive journalist fall for his bad-boy charm?) doesnt always sit comfortably with the hellish images of hacked-off limbs machine-gun-toting child soldiers and teeming refugee camps. Theres something disturbingly formulaic about the ferociously well-staged outbursts of violence which arrive with a metronomic regularity that can seem more opportunistic than organic. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week But there is much to admire here. Zwick (""Legends of the Fall"" ""The Last Samurai"") who can err on the stolid side seems energized and engaged by the African milieu hes in peak form. DiCaprio transformed by his pitch-perfect South African accent is utterly convincing as a tough driven adventurer he exudes the masculine charisma he hadnt grown into in ""Gangs of New York."" Hounsou as always cuts an imposing sympathetic figure but it would be nice if for once he didnt have to play a noble moral paragon. ""Blood Diamond"" only skims the surface of many important subjects--the script doesnt begin to explain what the civil war was about. But if it opens a few eyes it will have done its job. CHILDREN OF MENLondon 2027. While the rest of the world has collapsed into chaos the United Kingdom conjured up in Alfonso Cuarons gripping but problematic dystopian thriller is hanging on by a militaristic thread. Terrorist bombs explode near Piccadilly. Immigrants and refugees are rounded up and held in pens awaiting deportation. The world is plagued by infertility its been 19 years since a baby was born. How do you live with no hope of a future for the species?The former activist Theo (Clive Owen) has succumbed to whisky-fueled numbness--until hes called upon by his ex-lover (Julianne Moore) now a radical leader fighting for refugee rights to get transit papers for Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) a young African woman who desperately needs to flee the country. Theres good reason for the urgency Kee is pregnant.Cuaron and his phenomenal cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki bring this bleak terrifying near-future to life in astonishingly tactile images. Cuaron (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") is one of the most exciting filmmakers around. He stages breathtaking action sequences one in which marauding thugs attack a car in the countryside is unlike anything youve seen.The filmmaking is so accomplished you wish it were matched by the script which was adapted from a P. D. James novel by Cuaron and four other credited writers. (That many scribes is never a good sign.) ""Children of Men"" is clearly more than a thrilling chase movie its meant to hold a barely distorted mirror to the world were living in now. But the characters are too sketchy for the political metaphors to resonate. (The exception is Theos old hippie mentor and friend beautifully played by Michael Caine a pot-smoking cartoonist whos retreated to his hidden home in the woods.) The infertility theme isnt explored in any depth. What exactly will it accomplish to get Kee out of the country? Since the future of mankind rests on this pregnant girl we want details. ""Children of Men"" leaves too many questions unanswered yet it has a stunning visceral impact. You can forgive a lot in the face of filmmaking this dazzling. PANS LABYRINTH If youve never seen a movie by the ghoulishly inventive Mexican director Guillermo del Toro you are in for a unique treat. Del Toro alternates between personal Spanish-language films such as ""Cronos"" and ""The Devils Backbone"" and American horror movies such as ""Mimic"" and ""Hellboy."" He also likes to mix high and low genres fantasy and reality in unexpected ways. Theyve never merged as hauntingly as they do in ""Pans Labyrinth"" which blends a fantastical fairy tale into the harsh reality of Francos Spain just after the civil war.The tale is told through the eyes of young Ofelia (played by 13-year-old Ivana Baquero) who is uprooted to a rural military compound when her sickly pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) marries a Fascist captain (Sergi Lopez) a harsh authoritarian cleansing the countryside of the last remnants of the Republican opposition. Her only friend is the housekeeper (Maribel Verdu from ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") who is secretly aiding the rebels. Lonely and frightened Ofelia retreats into a world of fantasy. In a maze in the woods she meets the ancient satyr Pan (Doug Jones) himself who challenges her to assume her true regal identity by undergoing a series of tests. Ofelia enters an underground kingdom of ogres monsters and spells; we see how this magical universe echoes her real life and how in this fable of innocence courage and evil the lessons of her fairy tale have to be applied in the real savage world.Suspended between the brutally graphic and flights of lyrical fancy ""Pans Labyrinth"" unfolds with the confidence of a classical fable one that paradoxically feels both timeless and startlingly new. THE GOOD GERMAN""The Third man."" ""Casablanca."" ""Notorious."" These great 1940s movies and many more will come to mind while youre watching ""The Good German"" and for good reason. Steven Soderberghs black-and-white melodrama may be brand new but it is a 40s movie right down to the typography used in the credits and the big Thomas Newman score. Set in partitioned Berlin just after the end of World War II it has an urbane war-correspondent hero (George Clooney) sent to Germany to cover the Potsdam conference a femme fatale who reeks of Dietrich-like doomed glamour (Cate Blanchett as Clooneys old flame now reduced to prosti-tution) a callow young American corporal (Tobey Maguire) milking the ruined city for black-market profits and international skullduggery involving Nazi scientists coveted by both the Soviets and the Americans.It sounds delicious what movie lover doesnt want to take this nourishing trip down memory lane? But the siren call of Old Hollywood can be as treacherous as this woman of mystery. Attempting a frame-by-frame duplication of Warner Bros. 40s filmmaking--even the extroverted acting style apes the period--Soderbergh has produced a movie so self-conscious that its drained of all life. ""The Good German"" written by Paul Attanasio from a Joseph Kanon novel promises a seduction but it plays like an academic exercise. Soderberghs skill intelligence and love for the genre are never in doubt. But as it turns out you cant play it again Sam. LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA Clint Eastwood tells the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese side in ""Letters From Iwo Jima."" You can view it as a bookend to his recent ""Flags of Our Fathers"" or on its own. Either way its unprecedented a sorrowful and savagely beautiful elegy that can stand in the company of the greatest antiwar movies.Written in English which was then translated into Japanese by the young Japanese-American Iris Yamashita (who shares story credit with Paul Haggis) the screenplay brings to life four indelible characters all of whom know there is little chance theyll leave the island alive. General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) is the untraditional officer in charge who devised the 18 miles of tunnels that enabled the Japanese to withstand the American invasion for almost 40 days. He fights with the irony that having spent time in the United States before the war he reveres Americans. Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) is an irreverent young baker who just wants to stay alive to see his newborn daughter. The aristocratic Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) is a famous equestrian who competed in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. Private Shimizu (Ryo Kase) was trained in the elite military police but shipped off to Iwo Jima for disobeying orders to kill a dog. We see as well the old-guard officers who would shoot any soldier who tries to surrender and who when defeat seems inevitable order their men to die with honor by blowing themselves up with grenades. Eastwoods depiction of the horrors of war--and the atrocities committed on both sides--has a shocking intimacy.If ""Flags"" is more complex in its ambitions and structure the leaner simpler ""Letters"" is even more emotionally devastating. Superbly acted unblinking and unhysterical it looks beyond politics into the hearts and minds of the men we needed to call ""the enemy"" and lets us see ourselves. THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESSMovie trailers as we all know can be deceptive as anyone who went to ""Man of the Year"" expecting a knee-slapping Robin Williams satire can attest. The early glimpses of ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" starring Will Smith and his 7-year-old son Jaden had me fearing a tear-jerking blast of Hallmark card ""uplift."" The actual movie written by Steve Conrad and directed by the Italian Gabriele Muccino (""The Last Kiss"") is something quite different theres an inspirational hang-on-to-your-dreams message but it comes only at the very end of a long grim painful journey. Holiday cheer is not what this movie is offering.The movie is a fictionalized version of a true story about Chris Gardner (Smith) a smart struggling medical-supplies salesman in San Francisco in 1981 who dreams of becoming a stockbroker. In the film he takes an unpaid internship at Dean Witter--a huge and some might think irresponsible risk because only one intern will be chosen for a position at the firm. In debt with a fed-up wife (Thandie Newton) who walks out on him he ultimately loses his apartment and is thrown onto the streets with his son. They sleep in subway bathrooms and homeless shelters while during the day Gardner dons suit and tie and charms customers into investing with Dean Witter.Chris can be a fast-talking charmer but Smith is not coasting on his usual bouncy bravado here. He digs deep tapping into a ragged desperation and an urgent paternal protectiveness thats a far cry from ""Men in Black."" Newton doesnt stick around long but she makes a powerful impression as a woman knotted up with anger. And young Jaden Christopher Syre Smith is a natural. Muccino to his credit resists milking his million-dollar eyes for undue pathos.I respect the movies tact its honest exploration of homelessness its surprising refusal to exult in the rags-to-riches aspects of Gardners story but I cant say I was transported. Theres a repetitious one-note quality to the storytelling--the bone-density machine Chris sells gets stolen one too many times--that adds to the sense of oppression. I didnt see the ""20/20"" show about the real Chris Gardner that inspired the movie. But I suspect I would have come away more amazed and moved than I was by this honorable but dogged effort. THE GOOD SHEPHERDDirector Robert De Niro and screenwriter Eric Roths ""The Good Shepherd"" is nothing if not ambitious. In two hours and 40 minutes of grave hushed shadowy images it attempts to tell the story of the formation and transformation of the CIA. It begins with the agencys failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 loops back to the late 1930s when the Office of Strategic Services (the CIAs predecessor) was created and then takes us on a globe-hopping trip through the cold war.All this is filtered through the fictional story of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) a young Yale student plucked from the secret Skull and Bones society in 1939 to serve his country by spying on a suspected Nazi-sympathizing professor (Michael Gambon). The bright well-bred Wilson is an idealist but even as a young man theres something shut off about him he says little hides his emotions and is strangely passive in the presence of women even one as seductive as Clover (Angelina Jolie) whom he dutifully marries when she gets pregnant. Soon after he joins the OSS and whisks off to London and later Berlin not to return until his son is nearly 7. ""The Good Shepherd"" charts Wilsons devolution--and the agencys--from patriotic idealism to paranoid isolated ruthlessness. The cost of secrecy is his soul and his family.For the films mesmerizing first 50 minutes I thought De Niro might pull off the ""Godfather"" of spy movies. The tradecraft fascinates the sociology is astute the tense chess match between Wilson and his KGB counterpart ""Ulysses"" (Oleg Stefan) has an intricacy worthy of le Carre. But the unvaryingly solemn tone begins to wear and the elaborate flashback structure becomes confusing in the last act. Roths script is great on the cat-and-mouse games weak on the destruction of Wilsons marriage. Jolies character is barely coherent. And Roths choice to build an epic around a character as hooded as Wilson is risky its a testament to Damons skill and charisma that we care at all about this clenched careerist.Still even if the movies vast reach exceeds its grasp its a spellbinding history lesson. ""The Good Shepherd"" demands you watch it like a spy alert paranoid never knowing whom you can trust or who will stab you in the back. VENUS Shes vile beyond belief"" moans Ian (84-year-old Leslie Phillips) complaining to his friend and fellow veteran actor Maurice (74-year-old Peter OToole) about the young mulish working-class girl (Jodie Whittaker) belligerently ensconced in his flat as his ""nurse."" Maurice however whos always had an eye for the ladies takes one look at the sulky Jessie in her pink track suit and is enchanted.So begins the unlikeliest of May-December romances--his interest in her is sexual though he can no longer perform; her interest in him is strictly platonic--and so begins ""Venus"" a heartbreaking comedy that is simultaneously funny and sad raunchy and sweet funky and elegiac. These fresh unexpected juxtapositions are a specialty of the writer Hanif Kureishi (""My Beautiful Laundrette"") a sworn enemy of cliche.The once beautiful Maurice an elegant but blasphemous old thespian who still gets work playing deathbed cases on TV is a dream part for OToole. The lyricism and grace he had as Lawrence of Arabia have never left him--nor have the superb comic instincts of ""My Favorite Year."" Hes not playing himself here but his performance is haunted by our memory of the younger OToole. When his ex-wife played by Vanessa Redgrave spots Maurice in an old movie on TV and says ""Oh God how handsome you were"" we know exactly how she feels.Phillips is a delight as the prissy self-dramatizing Ian and Whittaker is a real find she makes Jessies ""Pygmalion""-like blossoming utterly convincing. Under Roger (""Persuasion"") Michells brisk tender direction ""Venus"" works on every level. Its a bittersweet meditation on mortality a lovely valentine to the acting profession and a fine romance with no kisses. NOTES ON A SCANDAL The aptly named Barbara Covett a stern resentful and lonely teacher at a shabby London secondary school is a master of both deception and self-deception which makes her a very dangerous woman and a pathetic one. Played with acid-tongued relish by Judi Dench in a radical departure from her roles as royalty shes a deliciously nasty piece of work.Barbara whose closest companion is her cat has fallen in love though she would never put it that way. The focus of her obsession is Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett) the new art teacher. Attractive young happily married with two children and a ""bourgeois bohemian"" sense of privilege Sheba is everything Barbara isnt--and everything Barbara wants to be.Imagine her shock when she discovers Sheba in the arms of her ardent 15-year-old student Steven (Andrew Simpson). But Barbara quickly gets over her horror when she realizes the glorious opportunity this presents. Now their fates will be forever interlocked. It will be our little secret she tells the shaken Sheba as long as you give up the affair.""Notes on a Scandal"" is a wicked delight. Adapted by playwright Patrick Marber from Zoe Hellers acclaimed novel its at once a comedy of cluelessness and class a melodrama of two women in the grips of wildly inappropriate obsessions and a ""Fatal Attraction""-style thriller. Its not easy to pull off the tales delicate mix of tones but Richard (""Iris"") Eyres zesty direction gets it just right. (Philip Glasss throbbing score however gets it wrong.) Blanchett whos played her share of queens has never been more intriguingly life-size. The restless willful Sheba is a wonderfully complex role a devoted mother married to a loving much older husband (Bill Nighy) she falls into her passionate affair with the cocky schoolboy having no real idea what shes doing or why. Hes just a callow average kid with raging hormones which makes the folly of her misplaced emotions all the more poignant--and funny. What happens when the scandal gets out Ill leave for you to discover. Even if you know the novel youll hang on every twist and turn.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Blood Diamond 1 / 2 Back to Gallery T.I.A."" say only three characters in only two scenes in Blood Diamond but the phrase echoes throughout the entire film. It stands for ""This Is Africa"" and it conveys a strange brand of fatalism -- adoring and exhausted like a cuckold who just keeps heading back for more. Its uttered with a shrug real or verbal capturing both the love that binds the continent and the chaos that tears it to pieces. War corruption blood-red earth and rugged beauty T.I.A. Blood Diamond was directed by Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai Legends of the Fall) a staunchly mainstream filmmaker who seems most at ease with the language of epic storytelling. If youre in the market for sweep or machismo hes your man. This isnt a bad thing; its just a Zwick thing. And the Zwick thing when applied to a film about Sierra Leones civil war and murderous diamond trade assumes a propellent urgency that rams home the message while it ramps up the melodrama. In either case it hits plenty hard harder when Djimon Hounsou wails for his children or Leonardo DiCaprio barrels onto the scene emitting his newfound haze of carnal ambiguity. He plays a beastly character in Blood Diamond a smuggler well aware of the blood being spilled for conflict diamonds who profits off them anyway. (""I provide a service"" he rationalizes.) Yet DiCaprios Danny Archer is in some ways his most heroic role since Titanic simply because he has no interest in heroism at all. Its a role that Humphrey Bogart might have played a disgruntled opportunist who has greatness -- or half-way decency -- thrust upon him. Dannys moral opposite is Solomon Vandy (Hounsou rectitude made flesh) a humble Sierra Leone fisherman whos torn from his family and forced to mine diamonds for an infamously brutal rebel group. At work in the diamond fields one day Solomon finds a gigantic pink specimen that he slips between his toes and tries to hide nearby. Just then a rebel stops him. Just then government troops come rat-a-tat-tatting disrupting the rebels and Solomon gets a moment to bury his rock before being carted off to jail. Archer also in the clink for smuggling gems to Liberia learns of Solomons buried treasure. Danny wants that diamond. In its pursuit he gloms onto Solomon agreeing to help locate his wife and children if Solomon leads Danny to the stone. So begins their trek through barbarity corruption and hope that involves repeated intrusions by a pushy score (by James Newton Howard) and no small reliance on coincidence. ""Just thens"" are employed regularly most often when two or more characters share tearful confidences in exactly the time it takes gunmen to arrive on the scene. Providing aid and righteous indignation -- plus a slight frisson of romance -- is a magazine journalist played by Jennifer Connelly with her usual classy sting. The screenplay (by Charles Leavitt the man to blame for K-PAX) is built on the sturdy Euclidean geometry of cynic idealist and victim that makes a fine foundation for a conventional Hollywood message movie. Which Blood Diamond is. But it is also powerful well-acted and undeniably persuasive. No wonder the diamond lobby is blowing its stack Zwicks film slaps blame on everyone in the industry from top executives on down to my skinny ring finger.

Edward Zwicks movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou as two men bound together - one by need the other greed - must make a sacrifice or commit its own sin of complicity. Its no spoiler to write that this not-quite- perfect gem does the honorable thing. And in balancing its major motion picture ambitions with thoughtful intentions this compelling neo-message movie offers a fresh T-shirt motto for the ongoing campaigns against diamonds that help finance corruption and slaughter Do the Right Bling. Its 1999 and Sierra Leone is plunging deeper into civil war. Smuggled rough diamonds help foot the bill arming not just the government but the rebels as well. Diamond smuggler and arms trader Danny Archer (DiCaprio) becomes interested in Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) when he hears that Vandy has found and hidden the diamond of his dreams. The fisherman was imprisoned by rebels at a mining site after his village was attacked. He was separated from his family. His 12-year-old son Dia was conscripted into chaos by a rebel officer. The Kimberley Process a 2002 United Nations-sponsored attempt to prohibit ""conflict diamonds"" from being sold doesnt stop the gems from making it to market. In this case they also make it into the safety deposit boxes of a London-based company that has rigged a stranglehold on supply. Stanley Kramer master of such Hollywood message movies as ""Guess Whos Coming to Dinner"" never had the explosive tools Zwick employs. Yet Archer and Solomon are updates on Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis escaped inmates in Kramers ""The Defiant Ones."" Only these defiant ones are bound not by chains but by a colonial past and a place where cynics and opportunists explain away mayhem with the quip ""TIA"" - ""This is Africa."" Neighboring Liberia with a scant diamond industry of its own is making billions on the gem. Hmmm. Jennifer Connelly plays Maddy Bowen the American journalist who follows up ""hmmms"" with pointed questions. Indeed much of this talkative films factual information about smuggling and corruption come via mini-debates Maddy and Archer carry on. One of writer Charles Leavitts snappier bits of dialogue takes place when the two first meet - cute then prickly - at a Freetown bar ""Youre an American?"" he asks sucking on a cigarette. ""Guilty"" Maddy says almost batting her fab blue eyes. ""Most Americans are."" Our American presence is in the details. Its particularly prevalent in the rough rap songs the child soldiers use as personal soundtrack for their adrenalized attacks on innocents. The most chilling scenes depict young boys transformed into AK-47-wielding killers. Its simple method really Strip the children of everything - parents siblings sense of self - then rebuild them in your own contorted image of masculinity. Drugs CDs booze and no curfew are the tools used to barter for their souls. ""Blood Diamond"" goes only so far in interrogating the gendered foundations for this out-of-whack world. After all the narrative understandably but tacitly accepts the heightened value of boys over girls sons over daughters. Connelly has a few tart lines that offer an alternative viewpoint. But the way the movie handles this gifted actor suggests an old-school disregard for Maddys truer grit. As for DiCaprio sometimes an actors range is revealed most in tiny gestures. On a bluff above the rebel camp the way he looks through the binoculars a little thing he does with his mouth declares just how fully he inhabits Archers body his mercenary talents and point of view. Zwick doesnt retreat from showing mayhem that shatters - or should. But James Newton Howards score throbs when it should be still. Let the misery go unaccompanied; squirming in our seats is the least we can do. Zwick and longtime editor Steven Rosenblum do pull off a succint and impressive sequence as they juxtapose an all-too-civil G8 conference on diamonds and the attack on Solomons village. Montages can be cut to dazzle. This one wisely builds a visual argument for First World pleasantries and Third World disasters. No wonder the movie has some in the diamond trade fretting. With sincere apologies to Tom Shane ""Blood Diamond"" makes it clear that the world has more than one fiend in the diamond business.

"Diamond trades on action and star appeal - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Diamond trades on action and star appeal By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  December 8 2006 ""Blood Diamond"" is about the moral conundrums of the international gem trade but the movie offers its own form of barter. If you attend our lecture on Third World suffering and First World culpability promise the filmmakers we will give you Leonardo DiCaprio pitching woo to Jennifer Connelly and yea many loud and hair-raising action scenes. If you want to further examine the ethics behind your engagement ring thats up to you -- but we sincerely hope you do.Its a solid deal as these things go but its hardly a steal. As directed by Edward Zwick the ""thirtysomething"" co-creator who moved on to films great (""Glory"") good (""The Last Samurai"") and neither (""The Siege"") ""Blood Diamond"" wears both its social conscience and its Hollywood calculation on its sleeve. The movie wants to rouse you to action while narcotizing you with Connellys bottomless green eyes.The first half dramatizes the lethal calculus of Africas ""conflict diamond"" trade with impressive force. Set in Sierra Leone during the late-1990s civil war ""Blood Diamond"" gives us two very different men and asks us to choose a hero. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a village fisherman who dreams that his son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers ) will go to college. Danny Archer (DiCaprio) is a former Rhodesian mercenary turned diamond smuggler.Dannys is a sweet business The Sierra Leonean rebels trade gems mined by captives for money and weapons middlemen like him sneak the diamonds over the border to Liberia and we end up subsidizing the death of thousands when we buy our earrings. ""Blood Diamond"" shows us the path of one anonymous African through this process and less convincingly how a smugglers moral compass might change direction.After the rebels attack his village Solomon is forced into slave labor; he comes upon a huge rare ""pink"" diamond that becomes the films McGuffin -- the thing everyone wants. Danny has been arrested at the border meanwhile and catches wind of Solomons find while the two are in prison the latter having landed there after government troops have taken the rebel compound.Pulling strings that lead all the way to the top of the European diamond trade Danny engineers his and Solomons release and a deal is reluctantly brokered If the white man will help Solomon find his wife (Benu Mabhena ) and children the black man will lead Danny to the jewel. Complicating matters is that Solomons son has been brainwashed by the rebels into a pre-adolescent killing machine.The movie is following recent history so far and as a consequence its ugly as sin. Innocents die and limbs are chopped off and the film dares you to look away. With the arrival of Connellys fetching U S reporter though ""Blood Diamond"" takes a turn for the ordinary. Maddy Bowen -- even the name reeks of a screenwriting seminar -- is meant to be the movies articulate conscience and Connelly is too good an actress to simper but her characters here only because Zwick and scripters Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell think you wont pay attention otherwise.Maybe theyre right but it doesnt help the movie. (Nor does the scripts reliance on coincidence in getting such characters as David Harewoods villainous Captain Poison exactly where they need to be.) Hounsous Solomon nearly gets left behind in all the chaste eye-batting between Danny and Maddy; ""Blood Diamond"" is another film about black Africa thats really about a white couple. DiCaprio is excellent as Danny and you almost forget the marvelous things hes doing with his accent but his performance is undone by his characters escalating nobility.Zwick makes a handsome film out of this combination of organics and plastic. As an entry in the advocacy-entertainment genre in which glamorous movie stars bring our attention to the plight of the less fortunate ""Blood Diamond"" is superior to 2003s ridiculous ""Beyond Borders"" while looking strident and obvious next to last years ""The Constant Gardener.""""T.I.A."" -- ""This is Africa"" -- is the cynical mantra Danny and his fellow mercenaries toss around but really This Is Hollywood. If ""Blood Diamond"" gets people to ask whether their diamonds have been sanctioned by the internationally agreed-upon Kimberley Process the next time theyre at the jeweler thats a start. Sometimes though theres nothing more cynical than the ways in which the film industry sells idealism to the masses.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"The Many Facets of Diamond washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Many Facets of Diamond Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 8 2006 I loved ""Blood Diamond"" until I didnt. This gripping sophisticated thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly is an extraordinary achievement in American cinema one that combines visceral thrills high production values and morally serious ideas. In this swiftly moving tale of geopolitical suspense set in Sierra Leone during the 1999 civil war DiCaprio plays a diamond smuggler named Danny Archer who routinely buys gems from bloodthirsty rebels to sell them to middlemen for European dealers. Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy a man kidnapped by the rebels who loses his family and is forced to work in one of the guerrillas mines. When he finds a huge pink diamond he manages to hide it just before the camp is broken up by government troops. Archer and Vandy eventually join forces to find the diamond each for his own reasons. Director Edward Zwick (""Glory"" ""The Last Samurai"") packs an incredible amount of information into the first two hours of ""Blood Diamond"" which was filmed in South Africa and captures with vivid kinetic energy the beauty of the African countryside the cultural mash-ups of its cities and the rank horror of its myriad bloody wars here put firmly in the context of 300 years of colonization and exploitation. (""Lets hope they dont discover oil here"" one villager says. ""Then wed have real problems."") As Archer and Vandy make their way out of the lawless powder keg of Freetown -- with the assistance of an idealistic journalist played by Connelly -- Zwick strikes a terrific balance between Indiana Jones-style adventure and an ongoing dialogue about the uneasy and largely opaque politics of globalization. How many women would want that diamond engagement ring Connellys character asks at one point if they knew someone had lost a hand getting it? A good question among many raised in ""Blood Diamond"" which features impressive performances from its three stars especially DiCaprio. Between this movie and ""The Departed"" the 32-year-old actor seems to have enjoyed a growth spurt this year; his baby face has given way to a new fullness and gravitas and he wears the new heft well. As engaging as the three leads are whats most impressive about the movie is a subplot having to do with Vandys son Dia who is kidnapped in the same raid as his father but is turned into a child soldier by a rapacious rebel leader. Of all the scenes of war mayhem and suffering in ""Blood Diamond"" (and there are many) the sequences of children being turned into psychopathic killers are the most disquieting haunting and potent. Indeed ""Blood Diamond"" has so much to recommend it that one hesitates to bring up quibbles. But problems do arise all in the last half-hour and all having to do with Hollywood conventions whether its a final overlong explosive battle scene a heros send-off or the vaguely offensive conclusion in which Vandy is portrayed as the voiceless moral conscience of the film (yet again our tour guides of Africa have been white with the black character reduced to noble but passive symbol). That ""Blood Diamond"" has hitherto so adroitly blended genuine action suspense and moral complexity only makes disappointment the greater when the film falters. Still it gets far more right than it does wrong and its most indelible images -- of the chaotic human landscape of war of Africa in its enduring verdant beauty of those tragic children so obscenely manipulated -- will burn in the viewers consciousness long after the less edifying moments have faded. Blood Diamond (135 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong violence and profanity.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor December 8 2006 Save for later Saved Hollywood has found Africa. On the heels of such films as ""The Constant Gardener"" ""Hotel Rwanda"" ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""Catch a Fire"" we have ""Blood Diamond"" set in Sierra Leone in 1999 when rebels are waging war on the government.Much more so than those earlier films ""Blood Diamond"" freely combines political grandstanding with action-adventure heroics. The filmmakers demonstrate how the diamond trade in Africa perpetuates corruption and bloodshed but they also want to deliver a rip-roaring saga.It is not easy to make this sort of combination work; usually one or the other element falls down. In this case the spectacular action sequences take precedence over the more didactic political material. Still one understands the impulse on the part of director Edward Zwick and screenwriter Charles Leavitt to make something grander than a conventional political thriller. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The film begins with a rebel attack on a village. A local fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is enslaved and his family is forced to flee. Laboring in the mining camps Solomon unearths an enormous diamond and before escaping during a government raid hides it. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Zimbabwean diamond smuggler and self-described soldier-of-fortune Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) learns of the diamond and attempts to coax the wary Solomon into retrieving it to save his family. An American journalist Maddy Brown (Jennifer Connelly) gets wind of Dannys machinations and tries to enlist him in her investigation into the trafficking of ""conflict stones"" - diamonds mined in war zones and laundered by Western buyers.To the filmmakers credit the relationship between Solomon and Danny never devolves into buddy-buddyism. Solomon is right not to trust Danny whose charm is just one of many tools in his survival kit. (His stunning brutality is another tool.) The movie also doesnt overdo the romantic angle between Danny and Maddy at least for most of the way. Maddy is so wised-up to Dannys ploys that for her yielding to him would be tantamount to defecting to the dark side.The most powerful sequences in the movie are the raids that suddenly erupt out of nowhere. Rebels barge through the landscape in their trucks with hip-hop music blaring like some infernal anthem. When Solomons 12-year-old son Dia (Caruso Kuypers) is kidnapped by them and brainwashed into being a child soldier the storys full horror comes through. This bright boy and good son changes into a zombie and his transformation stands in for all the horrors that war wreaks.Zwick in the past has often attempted to mix polemics and action and sometimes as in ""Glory"" he has succeeded remarkably well. But too often in ""Blood Diamond"" Leavitts script lets him down. Especially in the first half of the movie the characters particularly Maddy are mouthpieces for the exposition. The dialogue is stiff. Granted its extremely difficult to score political points and still keep everything sharp and lifelike. But it can be done. Roger Spottiswoodes great ""Under Fire"" about journalists in Nicaragua in 1979 is the best proof.As strong as ""Blood Diamond"" is in its best moments I wish it had been even harder-edged. DiCaprio is remarkable - his work is almost on par with his performance this year in ""The Departed"" - but ultimately he is playing a swashbuckling good guy. Hes in the cynical-on-the-outside soft-on-the-inside Bogart mold from ""Casablanca.""By contrast Hounsous Solomon although his part is underwritten has a gravity and force that makes most of the movies romanticisms seem forced and inauthentic. His son is the real diamond to be retrieved and he never lets us forget it. Grade B+ Rated R for strong violence and language.

"Blood Diamond | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blood-diamond ) Blood Diamond (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli To an extent Blood Diamond is a victim of its own length. While the film includes a number of disturbing political and sociological insights the adventure story is tepid and loses momentum as the storyline bogs down. The main character played by Leonardo DiCaprio has an effective arc that is believable because it does not force him to act contrary to his nature but it takes a long time for Blood Diamond to get us to DiCaprios moment of recognition. Pacing issues aside this is a well constructed movie - clearly the product of a director who understands how to make a top-notch motion picture. It looks great and sounds great. If only Edward Zwicks mastery of the medium had extended to pruning the screenplay and editing the final result Blood Diamond might have been a tremendous film rather than one worthy of only a lukewarm recommendation. The story takes place in 1999 Sierra Leone when the country is embroiled in a civil war. In this struggle its hard to determine which side is worse the government or the rebels. As is often the case in this sort of bloodbath atrocities abound and its the innocent farmers and villagers caught in between who pay the price. Diamonds one of the countrys largest exportable commodities are being smuggled out and purchased on the open market despite a supposed international ban on the purchase of so-called ""conflict diamonds"" or ""blood diamonds."" This historical background (which is more complicated as presented in the movie) is accurate although the three primary characters embroiled in events are fictional. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a loving husband and father who lives a peaceful existence on a farm in an out-of-the-way community in Sierra Leone. He sends his young son Dia (Caruso Kuypers) to a school to learn English so the boy will grow up to have a better life. One day terror comes to Solomons village when the rebels arrive and kill or capture nearly everyone living there. Solomons family is ripped from him and he is sent to work harvesting diamonds. While sifting through sand from a shallow river bottom he discovers a 100-karat pink diamond which he initially hides then later buries. Shortly thereafter he is captured during a government raid and sent to jail. While there he encounters South African ""soldier of fortune"" Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who makes a deal with Solomon for the diamond he will help the man find his wife and children. To achieve this aim Archer goes for help to American journalist Maddy Brown (Jennifer Connelly) whose price for aid is a tell-all expose from Archer about how ""dirty"" diamonds are laundered to appear clean to the world market and how much culpability the London diamond merchants have. Thats a gross oversimplification of what happens during Blood Diamonds first 45 minutes. This is a narratively dense picture that requires constant attention from the audience. As an action/adventure tale the film has its high points but there are times when the movie feels like its spinning its wheels. Director Edward Zwick (Glory The Last Samurai) is no stranger to epic films but none of his previous features have felt as long as this one. The film is uncompromising in the way it depicts the Sierra Leone conflict (which is fundamentally similar to the many wars that have recently dotted the African continent). We see the mass slaughter of innocents as both the government and the rebels mow down men women and children indiscriminately. We see how the rebels recruit young boys indoctrinate them through torture and drug use and turn them into hardened killers. Patriotism is equated with a high body count. Theres something disturbing about the sight of a ten-year old boy firing an automatic rifle into a crowd of unarmed panicked people. Blood Diamond is as effective in depicting the corruption of innocents as it is in showing the harrowing hell of this kind of war. It also highlights the greed and manipulation that characterizes the international diamond market. Two of the three characters are well developed. Archer has the most complete arc. Thankfully he never loses his ""me first"" attitude but we come to understand how it has developed and we see a gradual softening of some of his morals. Its a solid performance from Leonardo DiCaprio who has grown into this sort of ""gritty"" role and is more believable after having been seen dancing on the dark side in The Departed. This is not the same actor who set young female hearts aflutter ten years ago. He has discovered a measure of gravitas. Unlike Archer Solomon doesnt have an arc. Hes single-minded in his focus find his wife two daughters and son. His passion drives the movie forward; when Blood Diamond has urgency its because of him. Djimon Hounsou is volcanic in this role. Less substantive is the part of Maddy Brown whos in less than half of the movie (she is absent from the final third). Jennifer Connelly does the best she can with the clichA(c)d part of an idealistic journalist but the writing isnt there and Maddy ends up being largely forgettable - a character necessitated by the plot rather than a living breathing human being. At least theres the hint of a spark between Connelly and DiCaprio which keeps things interesting when theyre together. Blood Diamond is a mixed bag - a movie that has its share of stark unforgettable moments but whose substance never fully gels. Despite the participation of two marquee topping actors and the strength of the directors resume its hard to imagine theres much of an audience for a movie fueled more by the politics of African atrocities than the adrenaline and testosterone cocktail that typically characterizes this sort of film. The films length works against it but theres enough here to warrant a recommendation even if its not the most enthusiastic one I have ever given to a Zwick production.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou deliver powerful moments but those moments are liberally spaced along a lengthy trek -- one that periodically pauses to scold the U.S. audience for complicity in the regions exploitation. As such overseas appeal might outstrip the yield from domestic mines. Having already roiled the diamond industry ""Blood Diamond"" arrives with the best of intentions harrowing sequences but ultimately mixed results. Another sweeping at times heartbreaking view of the horrors inflicted upon Africa (in this case Sierra Leones civil war) its also a quest for a fabulous stone that Hitchcock would have called a MacGuffin -- namely an ice-cube-sized pink diamond. Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou deliver powerful moments but those moments are liberally spaced along a lengthy trek -- one that periodically pauses to scold the U.S. audience for complicity in the regions exploitation. As such overseas appeal might outstrip the yield from domestic mines. Set in 1999 rebels wage war against Sierra Leones government and the movie quickly establishes the brutal toll exacted on innocent bystanders Rebels raid a village occupied by the fisherman Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) lopping off arms murdering women and children and sending his family fleeing. Solomon himself is taken hostage and forced to labor in the mining camps which generate millions of dollars used to finance the arms trade and thus perpetuate Africas bloody nightmare. Before escaping during a government assault however Solomon unearths and hides an enormous invaluable diamond word of which reaches smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio) who prefers the label ""soldier of fortune."" Danny convinces Solomon that the only way to reunite his family is to sell the diamond and use the proceeds. Meanwhile an American journalist Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) wants the Afrikaners aid in exposing trafficking in ""conflict stones"" -- diamonds plucked from war-torn areas and laundered through legitimate Western merchants. ""Im using him and youre using me and that is how it works isnt it?"" Danny snaps at Maddy who is clearly on hand to stir pangs of conscience as much as offer a potential love interest given that the burgeoning war leaves scant time for romance. Director Ed Zwick and writer Charles Leavitt perhaps strike their most lingering chord via a subplot involving Solomons son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) who is brought into rebel custody and transformed into a ""child soldier."" The indoctrination includes teaching youths to kill almost casually and the sight of children ruthlessly brandishing automatic weapons becomes one of the films more indelible images. In the end though Zwick is trying to juggle several balls at once and does so with a heavy hand -- delivering a history lesson on the sordid resource exploitation of Africa from within and from abroad expounding on the role of wanton consumerism (always nice right before the holidays) and still developing a traditional quest thriller that will theoretically open Dannys blinkered eyes to the suffering around him. Its a tremendous amount of ground to cover and the films last third is less than wholly convincing or satisfying unable to deliver on its early promise. DiCaprio nevertheless again acquits himself admirably after ""The Departed"" bringing a roguish charm to Danny. Hounsou is also characteristically strong as the movies moral center -- thrust into a familiar position regarding cinematic Africa (think ""Hotel Rwanda"") as well as his own resume (think ""Gladiator"") separated from and struggling to safeguard his family as chaos erupts all around him. Filmed almost entirely in Africa pic captures a big adventurous scope including sweeping vistas of lush jungle large-scale bursts of action and a massive refugee camp poignantly described as ""an entire country made homeless."" Africas enduring sorrow is ripe for drama but ""Blood Diamond"" is finally a fitting metaphor for the gems Potentially brilliant from a distance but upon closer inspection one likely will see the flaws.
