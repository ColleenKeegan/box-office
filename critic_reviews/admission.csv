Next Out of Africa Millennium Films Facebook Twitter Print Movies Olympus Games Plus a Tina Fey fizzle and the pervy ugly Spring Breakers by Wesley Morris on March 22 2013 Sometimes no matter how many right notes an action movie hits -- no matter how thoroughly say the White House is sacked; how comically the secretary of Defense is dragged down a hall while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance; or how satisfying it is to watch one ex-soldier and former Secret Service agent take down dozens of North Korean lunatics to save the president of the United States -- it can still feel like the filmmakers just tore open a pouch labeled ""blockbuster"" poured its powder into a bowl and opened the microwave. Olympus Has Fallen is made from action-movie mix. Just add sweat. The music (horns strings swiftly beaten drums) is too much like what you hear in video-game home screens and military recruitment ads. The story in which North Korean terrorists hold hostage the president (Aaron Eckhart) and some of his Cabinet is political the way army fatigues on Rihanna are political. And the star (Gerard Butler) feels like the producers third or fourth backup even though one of the producers is the star himself. Despite the professionalism put into downing American helicopters arranging corpses on the White House lawn and making sure every Beltway-disaster-movie cliche is checked off all Olympus Has Fallen has going for it is that generic professionalism. Butler plays Mike a detective who used to guard the First Family until a terrible accident forced his pal the president to demote him. Mike sees his old buddies and gets wistful for his old job. When the North Koreans hatch their absurdly effective hostage plot Mike gets armed to the teeth and prowls through the Oval Office and Lincoln Bedroom with the amusing seriousness of a Mattel toy starring in Platoon. The store-brand quality that courses through this movie also has to do with Butlers being surrounded by Eckhart Melissa Leo Angela Bassett Ashley Judd Radha Mitchell and Morgan Freeman without really ever giving them an occasion to rise to. Well after about 85 minutes of sitting tied up next to Eckhart it is Leo who gets to defiantly recite that Pledge of Allegiance. But its hard to watch anything that so badly misuses its four leading women. Mitchell spends most of her time nursing it up at a nearby hospital in crisis mode. Like First Lady Judd shes here (however expendably) to remind us that when Mike and POTUS lock eyes and eventually arms its just two dudes being in love ... with like um standing up to terrorism and saving America. But we also need the movie to throw us better more original curveballs than casting a hot guy (Rick Yune) as the terrorist mastermind or finding new ways to cross off Beltway-disaster-movie cliche no. 1 making Freeman commander-in-chief. Yes because Eckhart and the vice-president are holed up Speaker of the House Freeman takes over and reminds you that as ferocious and intense an actor as Eckhart is nothing about him says ""presidential."" Antoine Fuqua ( Training Day Shooter) directs with the dutiful anonymity of whoever made Iron Eagle II or Delta Force 3. Without the showmans insanity of a Michael Bay the flagrance of a Jerry Bruckheimer the boundless cash of a Joel Silver or the hawkish ideology of a Tom Clancy adaptation youre left with an accidental parody of what happens when crazies attack. You want gusto. You want evil. You want charisma. You get a lot of cardboard heroism and self-defensive machismo. Butler is more than serviceable even though his American accent is like water in a dirty glass. (All you can taste is the residue of whatever was in it before.) In one flavorless film after the next he has always seemed like a cut-rate Russell Crowe or discount Mel Gibson -- the fire in him is Duraflame. But this movie is a shrewd choice. I could hear the audience falling in love with him the night I saw it. With the old icons virtually obsolete we might be ready for a newer loosely younger indestructible paragon of pseudo-military awesomeness. This is why were coming back around to Dwayne Johnson whos more convincing at this kind of bravado. But in a pinch Butlers forced charisma will do. Tina Feys starred in only four movies in the past 10 years -- Mean Girls Baby Mama and Date Night were the first; the fourth an aggravating romantic comedy called Admission opens this weekend. And in each you leave convinced that theres a more damaged side of herself than even what shes shown as Liz Lemon. On television the emotional complexity you suspect her of having was insulated by farce. At the movies there are too many opportunities for the camera and editing to catch her surprised by her vulnerability. When Alec Baldwin put her down on 30 Rock Fey was able to bob on the currents of his loving bile. In the rare moments when Admission is at its best the bile leaves a burn. She plays Portia Nathan a drably scrupulous Princeton admissions officer who gets a call to visit an experimental school in New Hampshire run by an old Dartmouth classmate of hers named John (Paul Rudd). When the kids give her grief about the oppressive corporate bogusness of the Ivy League system she snaps back at them. But when her uptight long-term condescending British professor boyfriend (Michael Sheen) leaves her for an undermining colleague she slumps. The movie isnt about the breakup. And even though I actually dont know what Admission is about theres ache enough in Fey to wish shed find material that allows her to explore it. Karen Croner adapted the film from a 2009 novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz. You can feel the script and director Paul Weitz trying to smooth a lot of activity into a single movie. But larded with a lot of physical comedy (cue Portia delivering a baby calf) it never ever coheres. At work Portia is vying to become the new dean of admission. She winds up in and out of the home of her estranged mom (Lily Tomlin) an ice queen earth mother and best-selling emasculator. John keeps pushing one of his students on her an oddball and screwup named Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) and after the first time its uncomfortable. Meanwhile the movie keeps pushing her in front of John. Each of these developments proceeds in a tone that has nothing to do with the other. Very few of the actors bring anything out of anyone else. And sexually Fey and Rudd have nothing to offer. When their bodies touch it feels scholarly like watching a pencil trying to kiss a pen. At the heart of the problem with this movie are matters of logic and cogency. As Jeremiah becomes a Princeton applicant John tells Portia that the kid whos been adopted by a couple is the son she gave up years ago at Dartmouth. How a woman as procedure-oriented as Portia would allow herself to get mixed up in a potential scandal doesnt wash. Neither does the ""you didnt love me enough"" melodrama with her mother. The character shuttlecocks from one implausible scenario to the next. In order for her sense of maternity to resonantly corrupt her professional integrity we have to believe in the kid and as delightfully unusual as Wolff is as a screen presence we dont see enough of Jeremiah to care when she sticks her neck out for him. But Fey makes a case that the real romance here is entirely parental. If were aligned with Portia at all its because the woman playing her is too. In movies Fey hasnt come close to reaching her flashpoint. The pratfalls and humiliations are getting in the way of what she could do with the maternal angst that she clearly drawn to. Between her old TV show and her movies I think shes been playing that mommy angst so long that its no longer funny to her. Its real. Right now her comedy blunts the sharpness of whatevers fostering that angst. If she dared to let the anesthesia wear off what she might do with the pain could be seismic. Its always fair to hope that Harmony Korines movies -- Gummo Julien Donkey-Boy Mister Lonely Trash Humpers the new Spring Breakers which is spreading around the country like an STD -- are on to something. You want to believe that theres some perception behind his grimy druggy vision for the movies that his carnivalesque attraction to freaks and creeps and the shocking stuff he has them do makes him a kind of Diane Arbus that he can sense truth in ugliness. Korine seems to be absorbing the same culture as the rest of us -- watching the same television listening to the same music getting the same greasy fingers we all do from gossip glossies. But Korines movies are like a toxic reaction to it all like he keeps missing the warning that says ""Packed in a facility that also handles nuts."" With his celebrity-impersonator romance Mister Lonely the toxicity achieved sweetness. The low-definition pranksterism of Trash Humpers was like watching homemade horror. For about a 20-minute stretch the definition in Spring Breakers is exhilaratingly high. Korine has swapped out the fuzz and grain and blur of his other movies for lasered digital crispness and microsecond montages. These are the minutes after which three college girls (Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson and Korines wife Rachel) have held up a diner to realize the spring break dreams of another friend -- a dull Christian played by Selena Gomez. They arrive in St. Petersburg Florida fully bikinied hungry for fun and open to exploitation. But theyre not what brings Korine to the beaches and cheap motels. Its the opportunity to marry jiggling flesh and hypnotically fruity color to the squealing bleating pump of the music of Skrillex. What Korine does with the beer-soaked skin face-devouring makeouts and piles and piles of barely dressed people is intensify the college-party atmosphere in a way that feels simultaneously orgasmic and repulsive. The moral squalor is so thick you can practically smell the police investigation. But in going for stylized personification Korine loses the social principle. Diane Arbus warps into Nan Goldin. The degradation the girls face at the hands of horny young men is supposed to be tolerable because a couple of the girls seem to invite and instigate it (and perhaps because one of the girls is married to the director). You dont sense that Korine has gone into any scene with an agenda for what he hopes to achieve a scene later. When the college foursome winds up in the care and the bed of a rapping drug-dealing cornrowed sleaze played by James Franco the movie seems to flee from what ideas it has in a hurry like a plastic bottle speeding down a river. Everything Franco does here calls attention to itself if for no other reason than hes the only person in front of the camera with any discernible skill. Hudgens and Gomez appear to be here for the credibility-boosting stunt work. But Gomez seems afraid for her life and Hudgens whos really going for it cant yet act to save hers. As a team the quartet weaves into and out of embarrassment. When the girls gang up on Franco and force him to give head to a gun Spring Breakers scrambles the obviousness of the metaphor and turns strangely erotic. Still as committed as Franco is to doing everything Korine asks of him he instantly removes all the danger menace and atmosphere from the movie. His fame purifies the air. The risk is all on the women and Korine appears to have no capacity to redeem them. All the better to shock you I guess. But the movie is too calculated to shock. Korine just wants to be the danger hes warning us about.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Mar 22 2013 Culture Focus ""Whats the secret to getting in?"" This question is posed by a desperate Princeton applicant to Portia Nathan (Tina Fey) early in the new comedy Admission. Portia you see is a 16-year veteran of the Princeton admissions office and is thus in a position to know. Her platitudinous advice to the student is to ""just be yourself"" though she will subsequently confide in voiceover that ""there is no secret.""But over the course of two uneven morally confused hours Admission will suggest that there is in fact a secret. (Mild spoilers follow but Ill endeavor not to give away any more than the trailer and I suspect the majority of reviews.) The secret to getting into Princeton is to be the unknowing son--long ago given away for adoption--of a Princeton admissions officer who is willing to break every conceivable rule in order to get you in. So there you go ambitious high-schoolers of America It may be a tough trick but if you can pull it off an Ivy League diploma is as good as yours.When we first meet Portia her life is defined by its comfortable dullness. Shes been living with the head of the English department (Michael Sheen) for 10 years in a friendly but evidently sexless relationship. (An ongoing gag is that he pats her on the head like a dutiful retriever.) Her boss at the admissions office is stepping down and he announces that shes one of two candidates to rise into his job. You can cut the excitement with a spoon. Related Story What Tina Fey Learned From Her Online Critics But chaos rears its snaky heads when Portia receives a phone call from an old college classmate John (Paul Rudd) who runs an alternative school in New England. He believes that one of his students an autodidact named Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) may be the child Portia put up for adoption years before when she was herself in college. Jeremiah visits Princeton and everyone agrees that its just the place for a brilliant oddball like himself. (Having gone there myself I take some issue with this notion.) But how in the world will Jeremiah get in given his patchy scholastic record and profound lack of extracurricular accomplishments? Well Portia guilty over having given him away will cheat--a little at first and then a lot--on his behalf. This is a premise that could work as drama (look in sadness at the depths to which shes sunk) or dark comedy (look in hilarity at the depths to which shell stoop). But it doesnt work as a lightweight dramedy about a likable protagonist who makes a few bad decisions because her life is suddenly more complicated than expected. Screwing over other applicants in order to get your favored candidate admitted is hardly a goofy misdemeanor. This might not be such a problem if Admission presented itself merely as a screwball comedy. But it clearly aspires to be an Apatowian Bridesmaids-y movie that has something to say about How We Live Now. Among its concluding lessons is the truism that we should not focus too much on accomplishments such as getting into Princeton that life offers many paths to fulfillment etc. etc. The question that drives much of the narrative is not ""Will Jeremiah get into Princeton or will he have to go to a (for him) marginally less appealing school?"" Theres no suggestion that he even applies to any other colleges. The problem is that by the time the movie offers this sermon it has spent an hour and 45 minutes treating Jeremiahs admission as an issue of unfathomable urgency. The question that drives much of the narrative is not ""Will Jeremiah get into Princeton or will he have to go to a (for him) marginally less appealing school?"" Theres no suggestion that he even applies to any other colleges. Rather the implicit message is that he will either get into Princeton where his innate genius will flourish or hell wind up working at the Stop n Go convenience store run by his adoptive parents. (The film also highlights its absurd educational Manichaeism in one of its better set pieces when the admissions committee is considering applicants who materialize in the room and if rejected are dropped down an imaginary shaft. Its a decent image--until you realize that the ""shaft"" leads not to some hellish oblivion but to Brown or Berkeley or Swarthmore or any of a few dozen other top schools.) Moral confusions aside Admissions greater crime is that it isnt very funny. As so often seems the case with contemporary comedies about unmarried women the movie spends much of its running time heaping humiliation and indignity upon its protagonist. (Another ongoing gag is that whenever Portia hits an exceptionally low point--throwing up outside an undergrad party sobbing uncontrollably etc.--her ex-boyfriend and his bitchy new gal happen to wander by. Funny) There are several obvious jokes about the superstar high-achievers who apply to Princeton (""and my father is Cuban and in a wheelchair"") and the snotty legacy cases as well. At the other comparably hilarious end of the sociopolitical spectrum is Pauls alternative school where he teaches his kids to build irrigation systems from hewn logs and has Portia help him deliver a breached calf. (Gross) All too frequently Admission serves as an object lesson in the risks of having a non-comic writer (Karen Croner whose other screenplay to date was the cancer drama One True Thing) adapt a non-comic novel (by Jean Hanff Korelitz) and handing the result to a director Paul Weitz whose last comedy was Little Fockers. There are amusements to be found along the way. Both Fey and Rudd are better than the material theyre given and Lily Tomlin and Olek Krupa have a few wicked moments apiece as Portias feminist mom and a philosophy professor whos admired her from afar. Moreover the movie is right on the nose in pointing out that there is no unhappy moment in life that cannot be made unhappier still by ones stumbling upon a Princeton a capella group singing ""Tigertown Blues"" beneath a gothic arch.But such diversions are not enough. As the movie progresses it becomes more and more glaringly an argument between extremes the stagnant risk-averse Portia who gave up a child for adoption versus the rootless wandering Paul who adopted a child and now drags the kid all over the globe in a quest for purpose. The moms are these two caricatures inverted Tomlin vehemently anti-conformist with her Bella Abzug tattoo and aversion to ""mother-daughter role-playing crap""; Pauls mom (Lisa Emery) wealthy and shrewish notable chiefly for her lawn jockeys. (Retrograde) Even Krupas urbane free-spirited intellectual must be balanced out by petty small-minded admissions officers (Wallace Shawn Gloria Reuben) and a smugly preppie alumni adviser (Brian DArcy James). These abstractions with faces--and the easy pieties they embody--wear out their welcome long before the credits roll.What is most distressing about Admission though is that it serves as further evidence that Tina Fey despite her dominance of the small screen has not yet mastered the big one. Baby Mama Date Night--neither was awful but neither lived up to an average episode of 30 Rock. The lesson offered by her best film Mean Girls would seem to be that she ought to write her own screenplays. Alas her immediate plans post-30 Rock include more roles in movies written by others (The Muppets...Again a re-teaming with Steve Carell in Mail Order Bride) and the planned creation of another show for NBC. Bottom line The quality gap between her work on the little screen and the big may not close anytime soon.

Twitter previousWhy Some Mothers Choose to Eat Their PlacentasnextOh the Avocados Youre Missing Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters How Chelsea Beat Ivanka at Being a Candidate Daughter Michelle Cottle The comparatively less flashy less spirited former First Kid managed to show her moms softer side at the DNC on Thursday. Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Reuters Trump Time Capsule 63 Whats In the Tax Returns? James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Admission Video Rated PG-13  117 minutes  2013 Tina Fey stars as a Princeton admissions screener who begins to reconsider her schools elitism when she meets a promising young applicant who may be the son she gave away for adoption; Paul Rudd provides romantic interest as the boys teacher at a progressive school. This is certainly an interesting idea though the movie is badly handicapped by Fey who must venture beyond her usual snippiness into scenes of genuine poignancy and proves unequal to the task. Rudd whos always functioned best as a straight man (Role Models I Love You Man) has no way of bailing her out though the more satirical scenes involving her Princeton colleagues (among them Gloria Reuben and Wallace Shawn) go off without a hitch. Paul Weitz (Being Flynn) directed; with Michael Sheen and Lily Tomlin. By J.R.

Include all high-school transcripts. Be sure to have all relevant test scores (SAT ACT AP) forwarded. Enclose two letters of recommendation and all admission fees. Do not call. There feel that old cold sweat coming back? The college admissions process is a horror not just for anxious high-school students but their often even-more stressed-out parents. And ""Admission"" set at Princeton both wittily acknowledges that fear and adds to it (with shots of enormous piles of rejected applications). But the film is about other admissions too. That perhaps weve made mistakes. That we havent done our best at everything -- and that thats OK too. And that perhaps in trying to raise our children differently than we were raised all weve done is created a different set of problems. Thats a lot of heavy stuff for a light comedy. ""Admission"" however is a smart light comedy as you can tell by looking at the credits -- directed by Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"") and starring Tina Fey and Paul Rudd with Lily Tomlin Wallace Shawn and Michael Sheen among the actors showing up to lend support. The story has Fey as a buttoned-down admissions officer at the university leading a pleasant but rather predictable life of faculty parties and endless paperwork. Then alternative-school teacher Rudd pushes a bright but definitely left-field candidate at her. And Fey uncharacteristically decides to take a risk. So does the movie. There are the usual and expected complications (no movie brings two attractive single people together so one of them can not make a pass at the other) but also some completely unexpected ones and some sharp jokes about parenting class gender and guilt. Actually an even better title than ""Admission"" would have been ""Acceptance"" -- because the movie is less about acknowledging a bad decision than learning and moving on from one. You wouldnt expect anything but a smart comedy from Fey whose work has always been sharp without being show-offy. And Rudd is as low-key charming as ever. But what a delight to see Tomlin onscreen again as Feys fiercely feminist mother. Or Sheen amusingly annoying as a weaselly professor. And Weitz direction is lively too particularly as Fey gets more and more wrapped up in these applicants lives. Suddenly theyre no longer names on a page. Theyre real people and they begin to materialize at the most inconvenient moments. Karen Croners s script based on a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz is somewhat overcomplicated stubbornly pushing a couple of coincidences into play. Theres also an unnecessary subplot involving Rudds precocious and adorable son who is neither as precocious nor adorable as the film seems to think. But the rest of the movie is fun and grown-up and even manages to build to a comic climax that doesnt require car crashes or people chasing each other through airports. So go ahead make an early decision -- see ""Admission"" this weekend. Youll be glad you enrolled. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations and some strong language. Admission (PG-13) Focus (107 min.) Directed by Paul Weitz. With Tina Fey Paul Rudd. Now playing in New Jersey.

"Admission reviewed Tina Fey is a master at coming unglued. Slate Sign In Sign Up A Not-Unreserved Letter of Recommendation for Admission A Not-Unreserved Letter of Recommendation for Admission Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 22 2013 121 AM Admission This Tina Fey rom-com isnt the top of its class but it still won me over in the end. By Dana Stevens Tina Fey and Paul Rudd in Admission Photo by David Lee/Focus Features You know how you sometimes cut a movie way more slack than it deserves just because theres something about it that gets to you? That was my experience with Admission Paul Weitzs comedy-drama about a Princeton admissions officer (Tina Fey) whose tidy life goes into freefall when she meets a young man she suspects may be her biological son. Admission is all over the place narratively and tonally; its blend of rom-com slapstick and heartfelt drama never quite gels and its multiple plotlines (there are at least four of them) dont so much tie up as just ... trail off. But I found myself curiously willing to overlook Admissions weaknesses or even to reinterpret them as strengths--couldnt those inconclusive endings be seen as a refreshingly un-rom-com-like embrace of lifes open-endedness and complexity? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In putting my thumb on the scale for Admission in this way I may just be operating under the influence of the films heroine Portia Nathan whose problem is precisely her inability to stop cutting a worthy but flawed candidate too much slack. Portias motives may be nobler than mine--its not every day that the baby you gave up for adoption resurfaces in your life as a brilliant but materially disadvantaged autodidact whom you are uniquely positioned to help. But in my defense romantic comedies that truck in real human emotion--that make you however intermittently squirm and cringe and laugh and cry--dont grow on trees either. Admission adapted by Karen Croner from a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz (who herself briefly worked in the Princeton admissions office as an application reader) doesnt aim to satirize the institutional elitism of the Ivy League admissions process but to illuminate its workings from the inside. It may gently mock the excesses of the dog-eat-dog selection system at top-tier universities--the pushy parents the cloyingly earnest personal essays the ever-more-arcane lists of extracurricular interests--but it also ultimately affirms that systems value (and by extension the value of an undergraduate liberal-arts education). This would be a good movie for a parent to watch with a high-school-age child facing down the college admissions slog--its mildly snarky but resolutely uncynical. Advertisement As the movie begins Feys Portia Nathan is secure--all but smugly so--in both her professional and personal life. For 16 years shes devoted her life to her job as a member of Princetons elite admissions team. Her boss the dean of admissions (the always delightful Wallace Shawn) is on the verge of retirement putting Portia and her admissions-committee frenemy (Gloria Reuben) in competition to take over his spot. For 10 years Portia has been living with her English-prof boyfriend (an enjoyably insufferable Michael Sheen) who occasionally looks up from his Chaucer just long enough to give her the kind of friendly head pat you might mete out to a distant acquaintances aged corgi. Any consumer of romantic comedies will recognize that this is a protagonist whose life is about to fall spectacularly apart. Within what seems to be a space of days Portias public and private worlds both begin to crumble. First she discovers that her boyfriend is about to leave her for a woman we know only as ""that vile Virginia Woolf scholar"" whos pregnant with his twins. (A recurring joke about Portia bumping into her ex and his ever-larger new love at increasingly awkward moments is that rare running gag that gets funnier each time.) Then a routine recruiting visit to a crunchy progressive high school in rural New Hampshire brings up a painful memory from Portias past. John Pressman (Paul Rudd) a teacher at the school confesses his real reason for requesting the visit He has reason to suspect that his brightest student the brilliant but socially awkward Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) is Portias biological son. As she proved over seven seasons on 30 Rock Tina Fey has no peer when it comes to coming unglued in slow motion which is what makes this movies middle section--after Portias life has (predictably) fallen apart but before it gets (unconvincingly) stitched back together--by far its best. Portia Nathan is a more familiar comic type than Liz Lemon the uptight overachiever who learns to slow down and experience real love. But Fey finds something deeper and darker in the character--especially in the surprisingly raw scenes with a superb Lily Tomlin as Portias mother Susannah a radical feminist whose hands-off parenting style is so brusque it borders on neglect. Watching these two smart acerbic comediennes bounce dialogue off one another like quarters off a well-made bed I found myself thinking Why hasnt Lily Tomlin played Tina Feys mother already? I would happily have watched a whole separate movie about Portia and Susannahs relationship but their scenes together are limited thanks to the scripts need to wedge in those multiple interlocking subplots. One storyline in particular about the fraught relationship between Paul Rudds character a globe-hopping do-gooder and his travel-weary adopted son (Travaris Spears) took up at once too much and too little screen time; it felt like an import from the source novel that needed to be either eliminated or beefed up considerably. The screenplay also seriously strains credibility in the second hour when the usually goody-two-shoes Portia overwhelmed by both her maternal feelings for Jeremiah and her growing attraction to his teacher agrees to throw her weight behind Jeremiahs application to Princeton--even to the point of cutting ethical corners at her job to land him a spot in the incoming class. Ultimately even Feys extra-credit performance cant save Admission from its thematic mushiness. Weitz--a sensitive director of actors who with his brother Chris co-directed the fine Nick Hornby adaptation About A Boy--never makes up his mind whether he wants to make us cry at a mothers longing for her lost child laugh at Fey and Rudds nerdy flirtation banter (""You have a nice nose ... in your face"") or go ""ew"" at the sight of three people slipping in freshly delivered cow placenta (a curiously tame gross-out scene that never even cuts to the effluvium in question--not that I need to see a close-up of a cow placenta but if youre going to get prissy about it why put the bovine-birth gag in at all?). But I challenge anyone whos ever been a mom or had a mom not to well up at the scene in which at the admissions committees final voting meeting Portia makes an increasingly impassioned and finally unhinged case for the specialness of the boy shes come to think of as her son. We could all use someone that crazy in our corner. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Hillary May Have Won the Convention War but She Did Not Win the Ratings War 2.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 22 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 22 2013 1201AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Paul Weitz Written by Karen Croner Starring Tina Fey Paul Rudd Lily Tomlin Nat Wolff Classification PG Genre romance Year 2013 Country USA Language English From the pun in the title to the multiple roms in the com Admission has a lot on its resume. This is one of those crowded-agenda movies that wants to be popular yet different too a formula flick that keeps slipping out of the harness to ride free only to strap back in again. The result is a picture curiously yet intriguingly at odds with itself One moment is edgy the next is not; the cast is terrific the direction is not; here its satirically sharp there its sloppily sentimental; now were happily engaged then were cruelly dumped. Some films are electric - Admission settles for alternating current. Multimedia Admission The official trailer video Video Big wins and funny moments from the Golden Globes The free-ranging source is Jean Hanff Korelitzs novel which looks at the gatekeepers to the grove of academic privilege that is Princeton University. The harness is Karen Croners script which tries to rebind the book as a conventional comedy. To that bright end Tina Fey is recruited to the starring gatekeepers gig. By day her Portia is an admissions officer passing judgment on all those wannabe players in the Ivy League. By night shes the live-in girlfriend of a weedy tweedy Middle English prof who treats her like a loyal collie - affectionate pats to the head separate sides of the bed. For sex he prefers to curl up with Chaucer and The Millers Tale or lately run around with a Virginia Woolf scholar. In the ensuing breakup Portia barks but doesnt bite.Yet she does bare her teeth back at the office which gives Fey who is awfully good at passive/aggressive a chance to put some trenchant into the humour. Childless herself Portia can afford to take dead aim at ""millennial parents who think that their kids application is the final referendum on their parenting skills."" And on that referendum she clearly enjoys voting ""No"" at least until a recruiting trip brings her to an alternative school headed by a former classmate John (Paul Rudd) an amiable liberal whose knee jerks to the plight of the Third World and the evils of the First. Well since any impediment to romance is slim to non-existent their amour can begin to bud. Which formulaically it does.The twists are more interesting although the first is unlikely when John introduces Portia to his ""student prodigy"" Jeremiah a self-described autodidact with low grades but a Mensa IQ that has him pining for Princeton. Oops whats more he just might be Portias son the one given up for adoption way back in her college days. Yes thats her ""admission"" and now a sudden parent she gets all millennial herself eager to sneak the boy through her hitherto locked gate. Hypocrisy can be funny and Fey definitely finds the laughs.But the more credible twist comes when Portia heads off for an infrequent visit to her ferociously single mom Susannah - a veteran feminist famous for writing a seminal tome and infamously impatient with ""any mother-daughter role-playing crap.""Director Paul Weitz has an obvious fondness for stories that chart the strained relationship between parent and child although his track record is iffy - scoring with About a Boy missing badly with Being Flynn. Luckily Lily Tomlin rides to his rescue here playing the old gal with a Bella Abzug tattoo and a manner to match - theatrically fierce yet without a trace of self-pity. Even better Tomlins comically broad performance allows Fey to show off her more subtle side. In the presence of this way-too-independent matriarch Portia is a study in paralysis a static mixture of cowed intimidation and repressed anger.In fact every actor is strong - Nat Wolff injects the nerdy teen cliche with a refreshing dose of mature confidence and Wallace Shawn brings his usual sly twinkle to a cameo as the head of admissions. Also a word or 50 about Paul Rudd. From the Judd Apatow surrogate in This is 40 through the smitten hanger-on in How Do You Know to the happy idiot in Our Idiot Brother he had made a career out of the good-guy role. Nevertheless this is typecasting built on a bedrock of talent - it takes a rare gift to play likeable likeably.But if the cast is sublimely professional the script is intermittently mundane prone to breaking away from its barbed attacks on contemporary parents or on Princetons rep as a ""corporation no different than an oil company"" and returning to the tepid embrace of stale comic convention - like a couple of clumsy set-piece scenes or that over-neat finale. Admission is admittedly a bit of a hypocrite itself - refusing to practise the very break-out-of-your-safe-mould lesson it preaches. Still theres delight to be had in a romcom where romantic love is the least of things and the easiest to obtain. Rather in the Ivy League and far beyond its filial love fickle too but so inescapably permanent thats much the harder test.

Starring Paul Rudd Michael Sheen Tina Fey Wallace Shawn Sonya Walger Lily Tomlin Nat Wolff Gloria Reuben Tina Benko Nadia Alexander Director Paul Weitz Running time 150 Release Opened Mar 22 2013  Editorial Review Looking for a place to belongBy Michael OSullivanFriday March 22 2013Like an anxious parent waiting to hear whether his kid has gotten into a good college I worry about ""Admission."" I worry that the quirky little film -- which stars comedians Tina Fey and Paul Rudd but is not exactly a ""Tina Fey and Paul Rudd comedy"" -- might never find its true audience. I worry in short that its a classic example of the cinematic underachiever a movie with a good head on its shoulders and a sweet heart but with an inconsistent report card based at least on the mixed reaction at a recent screening. Theres a high school senior with the same problem at the center of this off-kilter charmer directed by Paul Weitz from screenwriter Karen Croners adaptation of Jean Hanff Korelitzs serio-comic novel. Thats Jeremiah Balakian (Nat Wolff) a brilliant oddball with a lousy GPA who got stellar scores on his SAT and AP exams. Rudd plays Jeremiahs principal John Pressman an earnest free spirit whos so determined to get his misfit star pupil into a good school that he calls up his old college classmate Portia Nathan (Fey) a Princeton University admissions officer. John also has discovered -- or believes he has discovered -- a familial connection between Portia and Jeremiah an adoptee who is the same age as the child Portia gave up for adoption when she was an undergraduate. Believing that she is Jeremiahs birth mother Portias maternal instinct suddenly kicks in. That complicates her job which depends on her ability to accept or reject an applicant based not on emotion but on quantifiable academic suitability. Have I mentioned that ""Admission"" is not especially funny? The trailer cant seem to make up its mind. On the one hand it looks like a satire of academia. On the other hand it could be a gentle rom-com. In truth its neither. Or rather its both to some degree. Mostly its a tale of regret and letting go and how the paths that our lives take matter less than the way we walk them. Like Weitzs excellent ""About a Boy"" ""Admission"" is a serious film about life relationships and growing up with a gloss of humor. On paper some of it actually sounds quite heavy. Portias tart-tongued feminist mother (Lily Tomlin) has just undergone a double mastectomy. John is a single father struggling to raise an African orphan (Travaris Spears). And Portias live-in boyfriend (Michael Sheen) unceremoniously dumps her early in the film. Although Weitz and Croner keep things light theres a groundedness to the film thanks largely to the fine supporting cast which includes Wallace Shawn as Portias nebbishy boss who is considering naming her as his replacement when he retires. In their central roles Rudd and Fey have a natural unforced chemistry. John and Portia are cute as buttons but theyre also goofy confused and flawed people. So is Jeremiah. Wolff a juvenile actor who cut his teeth on the Nickelodeon TV series ""The Naked Brothers Band"" really comes into his own here. Im not surprised the trailer seems to misrepresent ""Admission."" Its difficult to pigeonhole. A little too quirky for the multiplex but too mainstream for the art house the movie could very easily get lost in the shuffle. And that would be a shame. I feel the same way about it as the Princeton professor whos asked to give Jeremiah a recommendation based on the boys performance of an awkward ventriloquist skit inspired by philosopher Rene Descartes. ""Weird"" the professor says shaking his head. ""I liked it.""Contains obscenity and some sexual situations.

Watch a clip from the film ""Olympus Has Fallen."" Disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) works with national security to rescue the President from terrorists who have attacked the White House. (Photo/Video Film District) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated March 21 2013 814 p.m. ET North Korean commandos in a hijacked C-130 gunship have strafed the streets of our nations capital invaded the White House and taken the president prisoner. Oh and the Washington Monument has been brought down. At this point in ""Olympus Has Fallen"" the speaker of the House played by Morgan Freeman goes on national television to declare that ""our government remains 100% functional."" This is good--at least an 80% improvement over our governments current state. But its the only good thing to come out of a nitwit extravaganza that makes you long for the intellectual depth of ""Independence Day."" ""Olympus""--thats the storys code name for the White House which for some reason is spelled Whitehouse on news bulletins from one of the fictional TV networks--is an action thriller based on the assumption that anything is plausible if its sufficiently violent and loud. With every car crash or plane crash with every firestorm emanating from the citys garbage trucks (the terrorists have turned them into virtual tanks thus confirming the adage of garbage in garbage out) subwoofers shook my screening room so intensely that I feared for its structural integrity never mind the integrity of the movie business. And special relish has been reserved for violence toward women; you dont want to know what the terrorists do to the secretary of defense whos portrayed by Melissa Leo. I neglected to note that Aaron Eckhart is President Benjamin Asher but this president could have been played by the Geico gecko given the movies scrupulous avoidance of nuance in any of its roles. The director Antoine Fuqua has become a specialist in superheated violence; hes working from a debut script by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt who we are told met in a screenwriting class. They must have been paying attention during the redemption lesson since theyve borrowed heavily from ""In the Line of Fire"" with Clint Eastwood as a Secret Service agent trying to redeem himself after his failure to protect JFK. The hero here--Mike Banning a Secret Service agent played by Gerard Butler--hasnt lost a president though almost. Still hes desperate for redemption and he goes after it with a vengeance Mike is the only one who can save us from the North Koreans and spare Dennis Rodman a trip to Washington. (For the sake of accuracy in the midst of idiocy the commandos and their evil leader Rick Yunes Kang may not have been sent by the Pyongyang government. They claim to be a paramilitary organization in favor of global justice and against globalization.) The film resembles ""Independence Day"" in several ways the most obvious being the beating that the White House takes. (Also the C-130s eerie ability to defend itself against our Air Force interceptors at least for a while by putting out a futuristic force field.) But theres a crucial difference and to discuss it I must first make a confession. When ""Independence Day"" opened in 1996 I wrote a review that was long on scorn and short on respect for Roland Emmerichs us-against-the-aliens saga. Now when I run across it on TV I savor its silliness and more often than not take time out to watch a few scenes for old times sake. Thats because the older film is good fun and therein lies the difference. The new one starts with a bold idea--maybe unmanageable but certainly bold and timely too--then throws massive firepower into the execution. Yet ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is no fun at all. To the contrary it soon grows tedious odious and oppressive. ""Hes just opened the gates of hell"" someone on our side says when Kang reveals his nuclear end game. Not quite. Theyre the gates of commerce and the wider they yawn the louder they clank. --Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com and follow him on Twitter JoeMorgenstern. Watch a clip from the film ""The Sapphires."" Its 1968 and four young talented Australian Aboriginal girls learn about love friendship and war when their all girl group The Sapphires entertain the US troops in Vietnam. (Photo/Video Weinstein Co.) The Sapphires ""The Sapphires"" isnt flawless but who cares? Its a joyous affair thats distinguished by its music and by the buoyant spirit of its stars. They are four wonderful singers Aborigines from Australia and a charmingly hapless white musician from Ireland who befriends and then manages the young women as they become The Sapphires--hear those echoes of The Supremes?--and journey to Vietnam to entertain American troops in the late 1960s. ENLARGE Chris ODowd Deborah Mailman Shari Sebbens Jessica Mauboy and Miranda Tapsell Weinstein Co. Good music is always rich in undertones and theres no dearth of them here. First though the tones that please the ear and warm the heart. In the story fashioned by Tony Briggs and Keith Thompson and directed by Wayne Blair three of the four singers sisters living on a mission in the middle of Australias vast nowhere sign up for a talent contest. Yes its that kind of story and youll be more forgiving of the cliches or happy to embrace them when you hear these sisters sing Theyre played by Deborah Mailman Miranda Tapsell and Jessica Mauboy. They dont win the contest; the fix was already in for a talent-free white contestant. But the next step in their musical--and personal--evolution comes courtesy of the Irishman Dave Lovelace whos played by Chris ODowd; you may remember him as the disarmingly charming cop in ""Bridesmaids."" Dave has his limitations as a musician but he knows his soul music and he knows how to get it from the sisters whose trio becomes a quartet when theyre joined by their city cousin Kay (Shari Sebbens). ""The Sapphires"" works best when its singers are singing; their adventures in Vietnam are dramatized erratically sometimes clumsily. But the film also registers the undertones of Australias history. Racial enmity and separation were the rule in the late 1960s when Aboriginal Australians had only recently won the right to vote. Not so long before that the movie tells us theyd been classified as flora and fauna rather than as human beings. Those undertones resonate behind the camera as well as in conflicts on the screen. Both the director and the co-writer Mr. Briggs are indigenous Aussies and the story was inspired by an Aboriginal all-girl group featuring Mr. Briggss mother who did in fact sing for American troops. When their faces and thumbnail biographies grace the end credits the film becomes a celebration of how far those girls traveled before and after Vietnam --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""Admission."" A Princeton admissions officer (Tina Fey) meets a college-bound alternative school kid whomight be the son she gave up for adoption. (Video/Photo Focus Features) Admission Nobody doesnt like Tina Fey and anyone aware of her starring role in ""Admission"" will be wishing her well. But wishing wont make this dramedy any less dreary than it is. The comedy component misfires from the start--literally from the first scene when someone says ""My GPS lied"" and the line drops with a thud--while the synthetic drama makes needless demands on the star. Shes a comedian not a dramatic actress and the director Paul Weitz doesnt seem to know how to protect her let alone help her. ENLARGE Tina Fey Focus Features Ms. Fey is Portia Nathan an admissions officer at Princeton University. (Why Princeton lent its name to the proceedings is a mystery yet to be written.) Although she travels the country speechifying about the worth of a college education Portia is unhappy and repressed--and thanks to the directors leaden hand nothing but unhappy and repressed--until she reconnects with John Pressman a former college classmate played by Paul Rudd. John has become headmaster of an alternative high school where he has found reason to believe that one of his students a gifted and likable kid named Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) is the son Portia gave up for adoption during her own student days. With a premise like that a movie would need the likes of Billy Wilder or Preston Sturges to succeed. Mr. Weitz being neither searches for a suitable tone and finds none. From moment to moment ""Admission"" can be foolish surreal unpleasant--Lily Tomlin curdles her every scene as Portias mother--or as is most often the case simply flat. (The script was adapted by Karen Kroner from a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz.) Only Mr. Rudd emerges unscathed. He protects himself by being consistently affable in the face of heavy odds. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""Starbuck."" A fortysomething slacker learns that 142 people all of them the result of artificial insemination have filed a class action lawsuit against him their biological father. (Photo/Video Entertainment One) ENLARGE Patrick Huard center in Starbuck. Everett Collection In Brief... ""Starbuck"" is more than the sum of its calculations though not a whole lot more. The title refers to the name used by the hero David Wozniak (Patrick Huard) during a long period of his youth when he was a serial sperm donor. Long and prolific David now an amiable nebbish in his early 40s finds that he has fathered 533 children--apparently theres a real-life basis for this achievement--and wants to be a guardian angel if not an acknowledged dad to them all. The scheme of this French Canadian film in French with English subtitles is at once intriguing and grandiose. Five or 10 children might have led to comedy; 533 of them make for farce. All the same Mr. Huard is endearing in the role of a perpetual adolescent who finally wants to stand up to his responsibilities which include the one baby he has fathered the traditional way and in his own name. Watch a clip from the animated film ""From Up on Poppy Hill."" A group of Yokohama teens look to save their schools clubhouse from the wrecking ball in preparations for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. (Photo/Video GKids) ENLARGE From Up on Poppy Hill GNDHDDT/GKIDS FIlms ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" comes from Japans Studio Ghibli the illustrious group that has given us a succession of animated masterpieces by Hayao Miyazaki. This film was co-written by the master but directed by his son Goro Miyazaki. Set in Yokohama just before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics ""Poppy Hill"" is a coming-of-age story in which the young heroine Umi who has lost her father to an accident at sea meets Shun the first love of her life. But its also an adoption story--Shun may or may not be her brother--plus a plea rooted in Japans rush to modernization for conserving connections to a past represented by a school clubhouse thats about to be torn down. In other words a film about many things--so many that the magic of Studio Ghiblis past has been displaced by exposition and earnest discussion. The movie looks lovely but its luminous prose. --J.M. ENLARGE DVD Focus Training Day (2001) Antoine Fuqua directed this supercharged drama which stars Denzel Washington as Alonzo Harris a murderous Los Angeles police detective who dispenses rough justice with an iron fist inside a steel glove and Ethan Hawke as Jake Hoyt an idealistic rookie. All of the abundant action is squeezed into Jakes first day as Alonzos new partner. Though Mr. Hawkes role is inevitably overshadowed by that of his sensationally effective co-star he plays it for all its worth which is a lot. The screenwriter David Ayer grew up in the troubled area of South Central L.A. where the action takes place. ENLARGE Spirited Away Mary Evans/Ronald Grant/Everett Collection Spirited Away (2001) Hayao Miyazakis animated masterpiece could also be described as a coming-of-age story in which a girl takes refuge in her fantasies and emerges from them a stronger person. But what breathtaking fantasies they are and what mysteries they contain. The 10-year-old heroine Chihiro finds herself alone after her parents make memorable pigs of themselves at an abandoned restaurant and forges a new life for herself in a glittering steaming hot-springs resort where spirits of every shape disposition and composition--good and evil opaque and transparent--come to refresh themselves. A must-see for film lovers of all ages. ENLARGE Clueless (1995) Paul Rudd is Josh stepbrother to Alicia Silverstones perky high-school fashionista Cher Horowitz in writer-director Amy Heckerlings Jane Austen-inspired masterpiece of teenage manners. Cher thinks Josh is something of an idiot but she comes around and so did audiences ""Clueless"" a major career move for Mr. Rudd was a beloved film of the 1990s and one that still captures a cultural moment with precision and hilarity. The cast includes Brittany Murphy Stacey Dash Wallace Shawn and Dan Hedaya as Chers father who warns her date ""Anything happens to my daughter I got a .45 and a shovel. I doubt anybody would miss you."" --J.M.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Many comic film actors specialize in larger-than-life characters. Tina Fey has made her mark in roles that are agreeably human-scaled. In ""Admission"" shes well cast as buttoned-up overachieving college admissions officer Portia Nathan. She guards the entrance to notoriously choosy Princeton University firmly and politely informing 99 percent of applicants that they dont measure up. Since she holds herself to equally strict standards when her life goes off the rails she loses it -- big time. But she freaks like a stressed-out control queen not a berserk comedian grasping for laughs. Portias life is a mix of small victories (shes in the running to replace department head Wallace Shawn following his retirement next year) and petty disappointments (her academic boyfriend Michael Sheen treats her with the same affection he would show a fine golden retriever). While Portias routine is usually as meticulous as her office bonsai she finds her life capsizing through a quadruple whammy. Theres backstabbery from her smiling-shark office rival Corinne (Gloria Reuben). Infidelity threatens the domestic front. John Pressman (Paul Rudd) the nonconformist do-gooder heading a crunchy-granola alternative high school makes sincere but rabidly unprofessional overtures. And most crucially Portia discovers a relationship to ultra-smart uber-awkward applicant Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) jeopardizing her reputation for strict impartiality. The story follows the narrative beats expected of a romantic comedy. After all when your stars are as innately likable as Rudd and Fey it would feel like a mistake not to bring them together. Their courtship isnt the central thread though. Portia named for the wisest of Shakespeares females finds herself in a serious ethical quandary as she pulls strings to advance Jeremiah through the admissions process. Confronting her own fallibility is one of the admissions she must make as she re-evaluates her personal and professional lives. While most college-themed comedies aim for low-SAT yucks ""Admission"" tosses out jokes and cultural references that aim higher. Director Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"") has a fine track record with this sort of lightweight but smarter-than-average fare. Lily Tomlin sparkles as Portias mother an old-guard feminist who warns her daughter against longstanding entanglements with men. After her character has been established we notice that she has a shoulder tattoo of Bella Abzug. There are plenty of details like that tossed in just to tickle whoever notices. The laughs here are mostly honest rarely forced and triggered by our identification with misguided folks this one overcompensating through workaholism that one through wanderlust and that one through political pontificating. Likable as Fey and Rudd are their performances dont break any major new ground. The acting honors go to a trio of winning supporting players. Sheen is blisteringly funny as Portias tweedy boyfriend eyes wild with fear that she will trip over evidence of his indiscretions. Reuben so strong and noble as the First Ladys maid in Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" is exquisitely disingenuous as the office predator with her eye firmly on the Dean of Admissions slot. And Shawn is perfect as the outgoing boss a sincere but gnomelike product of a privileged class whose defense of hallowed intellectual traditions is a grown-up game of eenie-meenie-miney-moe. Top marks all around.

David Lee/Focus Features hide caption toggle caption David Lee/Focus Features Admission Director Paul Weitz Genre Comedy Drama Running Time 117 minutes Rated PG-13 for languagesome sexual material With Tina Fey Paul Rudd Lily Tomlin Wallace Shawn Half an hour into Paul Weitzs new comedy Admission it dawned on me that I was watching an Americanized About a Boy -- which admittedly was also directed by Weitz. Both movies are adapted from other peoples novels; both cobble together families out of the waifs and strays of modern life. But where About a Boy was both funny and wise about urban alienation Admission settles for skin deep. Admissions plot hovers in the vicinity of two square-peg boys. One is small black adopted from Uganda and yearning for a normal life. The other also adopted is tall white and likes to perform ventriloquy through a doll named Rene Descartes. Hold that thought. But the movie isnt primarily about those two young men. Its mostly about what it takes to be a parent today -- biological or not willing or otherwise. Its hard to think of a demographic more hot and bothered about how well its doing its job than the one Princeton University admissions officer Portia Nathan (Tina Fey) is uniquely well-placed to observe. After many years on the job Portia knows it will cut no ice to say ""be yourself"" to a visiting platoon of graduating seniors -- not given the trailing horde of moms and dads wholl see their children into the Ivy League or die trying. When her annual recruiting trip brings her to a Vermont progressive school (Cow-Milking 101 that sort of thing) Portia encounters teacher John Pressman (Paul Rudd) a twinkly former college classmate who offers evidence that his top student Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) is also the son Portia gave up for adoption while she was an undergraduate at Dartmouth. Why yes Jeremiah also wants in at Princeton. Thus does Portia -- newly bursting with biological imperative -- turn into precisely the kind of rabid mom that once made her roll her eyes bending every rule in the admissions handbook to get Jeremiah into her university. Adapted by Karen Croner from a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz spouse to a Princeton professor and a onetime reader of applications there Admission is funny and sharp about the mechanics of wheeler-dealing in academia whose ferocious turf wars would put any corporate shenanigans to shame. And though Im not big on message movies I love this one to bits for urging parents to listen to what their kids want instead of treating them as extensions of their own ambitions. In that regard John is not doing too well by his own son. i Portias mother Susannah (Lily Tomlin) is an ardent feminist and seems to have ignored her struggling daughter for years. David Lee/Focus Features hide caption toggle caption David Lee/Focus Features Portias mother Susannah (Lily Tomlin) is an ardent feminist and seems to have ignored her struggling daughter for years. David Lee/Focus Features As an ardent fan of Tina Feys comedy though Im not persuaded that she can also flesh out a character in the way that say Kristen Wiig becomes a serious human in Bridesmaids. In Admission that may be because Feys being asked to rehash the what-have-I-missed career-woman nonsense that Hollywood continues to crank out years after that dreary trope should have gone into the dustbin. Compulsively orderly Portia trims the baby bonsai on her desk with nail scissors. Her highest ambition is to succeed her boss (Wallace Shawn doing his usual inquisitive-badger thing) when he retires. She fondly believes that her washed-up relationship with a fusspot literature professor (Michael Sheen) is going fine. And having been kept at arms length all her life by her militantly feminist mother (Lily Tomlin what possessed you?) Portia has persuaded herself that she never wanted children. In other words shes overripe for some remedial feather-ruffling to soften her into a real woman. Duly shaken and stirred by the twin prospects of love and motherhood Portia too must apply for something she wants very badly. She learns that applicants must also often be supplicants with all the emotional cost that entails. I loved that part but I wish that Croner hadnt felt obliged to build yet another Eve Arden mutant for whom the childless life feels like a glass half empty. I wish that not because such women dont exist -- Im one of them and I wouldnt be without my child or my work. But I have female friends by the bushel who are passionate about their careers adore their friends and/or lovers and call that a life well-lived. Will somebody please step up and make a movie about them without making them over in Our Miss Brooks image?

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 7 p.m. EDT March 21 2013Tina Feys character feels like a re-tread of her uptight workaholic in Baby Mama. But it was her chemistry with co-star Amy Poehler that really made that movie work.Tina Fey and Paul Rudd star in the genial but predictable Admission.(Photo David Lee Focus Features)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourStars Tina Fey Paul Rudd Nat Wolff Wallace ShawnRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 57 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideThe cutthroat and often baffling process of getting into the elite school of ones choice should lend itself to comedic exploitation of the highest grade.Unfortunately Admission ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) settles for being a genial predictable and ultimately forgettable romantic comedy.Tina Feys character is a puzzle. She play Portia Nathan a driven and humorless admissions officer at Princeton. Yet fairly often she pops off with comic zingers worthy of Liz Lemon her sassy 30 Rock character. Its tough to get a firm sense of who she really is a hard-nosed Ivy League gatekeeper? An emotionally-buffeted lost soul? A sardonic observer?STORY Tina Fey applies herself to Admission family lifeMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYWhile its certainly possible to encompass all those facets her character seems to switch jarringly among personas. Consequently the comic tone of the film seems jumbled. The serious issues it raises -- the state of university education and the complexity of parent-child relationships -- feel like props inserted into humorous settings.Portia lives with Mark (Michael Sheen) a smarmy English professor who reads Chaucer aloud and treats her more like a loyal Labrador than a woman he desires. When that relationship falls apart Portia is a basket case. She turns to her mother (Lily Tomlin) a free-spirited writer whos an odd amalgam of trigger-happy feminist and New Age philosophizer but finds little solace.Things grow more complicated when Portia encounters former Dartmouth classmate John Pressman (Paul Rudd) the easygoing founder of New Quest an alternative high school. While Rudd is thoroughly likable he and Fey lack the requisite chemistry to make audiences care about whether they become a couple.John is angling for Portia to accept Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) a super-smart but unconventional New Quest student. A subplot involving Jeremiahs connection to Portia is an intriguing detour.John and Portia would seem to be polar opposites which is why we know they must attract. Shes been in the same job for 16 year and doesnt want children. Hes traveled the world and in the process adopted Nelson (Travaris Spears) a Ugandan orphan.Portia is a cool customer strict and uncompromising. Yet after meeting John her composure is upended. Inappropriate kisses uncontrollable tears calf birthing and public vomiting ensue. Professional ethics fly out the window. The comedy grows more forced as she grows looser though there is a clever scene in which Portia and her fellow officers discuss the files of diverse candidates. The students make a fantasy appearance then drop unceremoniously through a trapdoor in the floor.Its as if director Paul Weitz couldnt decide whether he was making a broad comedy or a wry satire. Weitz has had a nimble touch with comedies such as the undervalued American Dreamz and a superb adaptation of Nick Hornbys About a Boy. This tale based on Jean Hanff Korelitzs book might not have been the best match of material and director.For a more compelling take on a similar subject check out a little-seen gem from last year called Liberal Arts.Largely because of its engaging cast Admission is an amiable but only slightly-above-average comic romp. 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/15vnBIU,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/yDAWH4x1y6A/,200,admission15,admission,usatoday
"Admission is a pleasant comedy that never takes its subject too seriously - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Admission is a pleasant comedy Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 03.21.13 | 301 PM Liz Lemon goes to college? Not really. ""Admission"" is a blandly pleasant comedy about one of the least pleasant rites of passage in modern America the scramble to get into an institute of higher education. It stars Tina Fey as a more cultivated less hapless version of her ""30 Rock"" persona a Princeton admissions officer named Portia Nathan. Like Liz shes not married to anything except her job and like Liz shes regularly cowed by a brazen superior being in this case her mother Susannah (Lily Tomlin) a fearsome second-wave feminist who lives off the grid in rural New Hampshire. By contrast Portia excels at quashing the expectations of Princeton applicants and their thoroughly obnoxious parents. ""Admission"" is based on a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz and the best parts of the movie -- there arent enough of them -- examine the soul-killing contortions the average high school kid undergoes to present the most stellar version of him or herself. This version manufactured in college essays and lists of after-school activities in multiple languages spoken and internships checked off may have little to do with who the student actually is and anyway how is anyone supposed to choose from thousands of shiny equally accomplished prodigies? ""Just be yourself"" Portia tells them a bit of useful advice that fools no one. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters (In the interests of full disclosure it should be noted that your critic has a high school senior whose own envelopes will be arriving in a few weeks as well as a close relative in the business. This either makes me the best person to review ""Admission"" or the worst.) Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The movie has an interestingly crusty surface and a center thats soft and formulaic; not surprisingly the director is Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"") a good filmmaker with a sentimental streak. Portia is approached by John Pressman (Paul Rudd) director of a hippie-dippy farm school in New Hampshire; he wants her to consider some of his kids and he especially wants her to consider an eccentric boy wonder named Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) who -- spoiler alert -- is revealed early on to possibly be the son Portia gave up for adoption in college. Factor in a burgeoning romance with John the breakup of her longstanding relationship with a tweedy English professor (Michael Sheen doing amusingly passive-aggressive things behind a tenured beard) the various politics of the Princeton admissions department (Gloria Reuben plays Portias smoothly smiling rival while Wallace Shawn is the outgoing head) plus the heroines struggles with her pill of a mother while trying to get to know her son without him figuring out he is her son and ""Admissions"" has to be either a delirious farce or a complete train wreck. Surprisingly its neither but neither is it a great movie. Fairly good will have to do (which in any event is better than ""Baby Mama"" or ""Date Night"" Feys most high-profile film ventures to date). The scenes with Rudd are enjoyably awkward -- John has his own commitment issues to work out not to mention an adopted Rwandan son (Travaris Spears) that the script stops just short of presenting as the Magical Black Child beloved by Hollywood movies. A party at the home of Johns mother (Tina Benko) a WASP doyenne with a smile like a bear trap is the only time the film comes close to examining matters of class which isnt nearly close enough. Fey seems relieved to dial down the sitcom wackiness and play something approximating a normal person and there are unexpected grace notes to her performance especially in the scenes with Tomlin. Yet ""Admission"" is being billed as a romantic comedy and that seems odd given how much sadness and disappointment hover in the background. Portias is the barely acknowledged tragedy of an unexceptional woman with a parent and a career that insist on exceptionality every step of the way. Even more flippantly each Princeton applicant that Portia considers visually materializes before us with youthful pride before disappearing down a chute in the floor doubtless to -- heaven forbid -- a state school. Youre right I am taking this too seriously; see parenthetical note above. That still doesnt change the fact that ""Admission"" is cheerful skittish entertainment that never takes its subject seriously enough. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"Admission | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; admission ) Admission (United States 2013) March 21 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Admission is a serviceable sporadically entertaining motion picture that has been aggressively developed for mainstream consumption. Infused with an almost relentless blandness its defined by soft comedy (a few laughs here and there) flaccid drama and likeable actors. Director Paul Weitz gamely tries to recapture something of the flavor of About a Boy but falls short of the target. Admission is the kind of disposable entertainment that wont generate sufficient passion to result in either overt pans or raves. For me its easy to identify why Admission doesnt work I didnt buy the situation. The characters are cut from the whole cloth of cinematic stereotypes but their familiarity isnt the problem. Its that director Weitz working from a screenplay credited to Karen Croner (which in turn is adapted from the novel by Jean Hanff Koreliltz) fails to ""sell"" the scenario. A lot of what shows up on screen during the course of Admissions nearly two hour running time feels stale and artificial. Its hard to determine whether Admission is a commercial for Princeton University or a condemnation of some of its admission practices. Perhaps a little of both. Certainly the university appears to have been on board in some capacity since it was filmed in part on location. The story focuses on 16-year veteran admissions officer Portia Nathan (Tina Fey) who finds her neatly ordered life in turmoil when she learns that an applicant Jeremiah Balakian (Nat Wolff) might be the son she gave up for adoption eighteen years ago. Although Jeremiah has terrible grades his SATs are nearly perfect and he has aced eight AP exams making his candidacy abnormal. As Portia investigates him she becomes enmeshed in a romantic liaison with his mentor John Pressman (Paul Rudd). Meanwhile shes dealing with fallout from the breakup of her relationship with a Princeton professor and is vying with a co-worker (Gloria Reuben) for the position of Dean of Admissions when the current holder of that title (Wallace Shawn) retires. One area of interest offered during the course of Admission is a peek behind the curtain at the factors that go into establishing whether or not an applicant is worthy of being brought up for a vote by the entire board. These ""fly on the wall"" sequences are more intriguing than the tired family drama and ""wacky"" comedy sequences. It often feels theres a really good offbeat story in here that has been marginalized by the need to be a crowd-pleaser. After all audiences are probably more interested in stories about relationships between parents and children than how the byzantine college admissions process really works. Tina Fey is without a doubt one of the most witty and charismatic performers working today but the screenplay of Admission fails to allow her to shine. Her humor is muted and the shes never really given an opportunity to display any genuine dramatic chops. Shes caught in the middle trapped in the molasses of the motion picture equivalent of Lite FM. I guess Admission wants us to laugh and cry but it doesnt do a very good job of promoting either emotion. One wishes Fey might have been given some input into the script. Paul Rudd plays the likeable schlub at which he has become typecast. Is there really much difference between John and Pete in This is 40 or George in Wanderlust? It has become increasingly difficult to see Rudd as anyone other than Rudd. Perhaps he plays the character too well. His chemistry with Tina Fey is more of the ""buddy"" variety than the romantic one. Their (admittedly tame) sex scenes dont generate much in the way of heat. Admission will almost certainly do well at the box office because Fey is a legitimate draw and the film practices strict avoidance of anything that might alienate any large segment of the movie-going population. My evaluation is to wait-list Admission and catch it when it reaches the less demanding platform of home video. And if youre a college applicant hoping to get a few tips for skating through the admissions process heres what the film has to say about what the ""secret"" is ""Youll have to find that out yourself."" Dont bother looking for it or much else here.

"Admission 2.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Admission 2.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Admission Director Paul Weitz.Cast Tina Fey Paul Rudd Nat Wolff.Rating PG-13 for language and some sexual material. By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Fri Mar 22 2013 1012 AM Tina Fey is funny. Paul Rudd is funny. Wallace Shawn and Lily Tomlin are legendarily funny. ""Admission"" the movie they are all in isnt all that funny. How odd. Whats more the film as youd expect from that bunch actually has an intriguing premise something beyond slapstick and name-calling. Fey plays Portia Nathan an admission officer at Princeton. Hyperorganized she is preparing for making selections by touring high schools where she offers the same canned spiel to every group. Shes also gunning for the job of her boss (Shawn) who has announced his retirement competing with the cutthroat Corinne (Gloria Reuben). Shes living with a professor (Michael Sheen). Life is good with all its elements like the trinkets on her desk in perfect order. Until the day she gets a call from John Pressman (Rudd). He was a classmate of Portias in college and now runs New Quest an alternative school. He has a student Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) he thinks might be perfect for Princeton. He also thinks Jeremiah might be the son Portia gave up for adoption in college. This isnt a spoiler; we learn this early on and the film is built around it. What follows is Portias unraveling which is disappointingly conventional All the order falls apart. Portia struggles to keep her life together while trying to decide how far to go in helping her could-be son with the admissions process. (Hes an auto-didact with perfect scores on advanced-placement tests despite never having taken advanced-placement classes. He also had a terrible grade-point average before attending New Quest.) In addition Portia struggles with her relationship with her mom Susannah (Tomlin) the famed author of a feminist manifesto decades ago. Cynical outspoken and ready with withering put-downs Susannah drives Portia crazy with her self-sufficiency and seeming aloofness. And yes there is also a romantic angle. Director Paul Weitz struggles to balance the tone between the dramatic and the comic. You could call it a dramedy I guess but that manufactured term suggests a blending of the two elements. Here they exist almost as separate genres squeezed into the same movie. There are some clever touches most of them having to do with the admissions process. Princeton is of course insanely competitive and Weitz working from a script by Karen Croner (based on Jean Hanff Korelitzs novel) has some fun with what makes a suitable candidate. Want to know the secret to getting in Portia teases her high-school audiences at every stop? Well there is no secret. Actually there is sort of but it isnt revealed till the end and it is obvious and banal if maybe sort of true. The cleverest scenes have Portia reading the applications of prospective students who appear in front of her physical manifestations of whats on paper. Few escape the trap door that opens beneath them after they give it their best shot. (See insanely competitive above.) As for the actors Tomlin fares best; Susannah says whatever comes to mind and Tomlin has no trouble making that seem genuine. Rudd is oddly adrift his characters wanderlust taking a toll on the son he has adopted. We see little of his comic gifts. Fey surprisingly doesnt seem all that comfortable with Portia. Shes engaging always and can wring a good laugh out of a clever aside. Thats on display here. But whether the struggle is hers Weitzs or both we never quite get a handle on Portia tonally or otherwise. Neither does Fey. ""Admission"" is pleasant enough. Even when off a bit the talent of the cast assures that. But its still a disappointment. You might say it ahem doesnt make the grade. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

Shes so good that -- up to a point -- you can ignore Paul Weitz erratic direction and a patchy script both of which clumsily handle shifts between comedy and drama. And the sad fact that theres zero chemistry between Fey and the normally reliable Paul Rudd cast as her romantic interest. Fey is a delight as the smart and ambitious Portia Nathan who hopes to take over as Princetons dean of admission when her longtime boss (Wallace Shawn) retires at the end of the year. On a tour to meet prospective students she reluctantly agrees to visit a new ""alternative school run by John (Rudd) a former classmate from Dartmouth who she doesnt remember. Paul not only remembers Portia but knows the precise day that she put her newborn son up for adoption. Eighteen years later Paul claims that baby has become Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) a senior hes been mentoring. And Jeremiah just happens to want to go to Princeton (which all his classmates hilariously dismiss as elitist sexist and homophobic). Before you can say ""maternal instinct Jeremiah is touring Portias campus (filmed at the actual university) -- despite the fact that he is not exactly ""Princeton material. -- while she shes Struggling with her hands-off vow before her fellow admissions officers Portia optimistically describes Jeremiah an avid reader who aces standardized tests but has poor grades as an ""autodidact. It sounds impressive -- they used to label kids like us underachievers. Adapted by Karen Croner (""One Fine Day) from a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz ""Admission works best when it sticks to the Portia-Jeremiah storyline. Unfortunately our heroine is saddled with a pompous English prof as a live-in boyfriend (Michael Sheen essentially reprising his role from ""Midnight in Paris) who conveniently dumps her for a Virginia Woolf scholar. This precipitates an extremely awkward romance with John who is raising an African orphan (Travaris Spears) he met while traveling the world. Rudd who is rarely funny here often seems to be acting in another movie. Even Steve Carell (a better match with the eight-years-younger Fey in ""Date Night) would have trouble pulling off a terrible scene where Portia and John bond while delivering a calf. Fey fares far better with the wonderful Lily Tomlin (who nearly steals the movie) as the hippie mom she can barely tolerate -- who claims to have conceived Portia in a quickie with a stranger on a train. The films funniest and sharpest sequence is a meeting of the Princeton admissions staff in which they debate who gets into the elite school. Portia frantically tries trading favors with her colleagues (including Gloria Reuben excellent as Portias ruthless rival for Shawns job) to get Jeremiah into the school. Director Weitz doesnt come close to pulling off the films drastic tonal shifts but at least its an improvement over his last two films (""Being Flynn and ""Little Fockers) if far inferior to ""About a Boy which Weitz co-directed with his more talented brother Chris. ""Admission still has considerable entertainment value as a flawed vehicle for Fey. But even she cant make you believe (mild spoiler) that Portia would end up committing career suicide to further the ambitions of a boy who in all likelihood will end up flunking out of Princeton.

BOTTOM LINE Fey and Rudd have their charms but the movies off-kilter ethics dampen the romance. Lets hope college decisions arent really made this way. CAST Tina Fey Paul Rudd Nat Wolff Lily Tomlin LENGTH 145 Tina Fey whose funny brainy persona shined so brightly on her NBC show ""30 Rock"" hasnt exactly lit up the big screen with the comedies ""Baby Mama"" and ""Date Night."" Blame the lukewarm material or her non-hunky co-stars Greg Kinnear and Steve Carell but audiences have yet to see the sharply written comedy and the sexy male lead that can bring out Feys inner Rosalind Russell. ""Admission"" directed by Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"") isnt the one. It promisingly pairs Fey with the dreamy-funny Paul Rudd though they generate warmth without ever catching fire. The bigger problem is the story theyre in. ""Admission"" based on Jean Hanff Korelitzs 2009 novel is the kind of Hollywood hokum that Fey would have skewered on a spit with a Weekend Update on ""Saturday Night Live.""

Paul wants Portia to meet his student Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) who is awkward brilliant and -- by the way -- apparently the son that Portia gave up for adoption. Its fodder for aw-shucks humor as Portia daughter of a radical feminist (Lily Tomlin fierce and funny) melts helplessly into a doting fretting semistalking mommy. And like many a mother before her Portia decides her son needs to attend Princeton. (Jeremiah clueless thinks Portia is merely sweet. Or a cougar.) While Portia and Paul canoodle ""Admission"" seems unaware that its protagonists have completely abandoned their ethics. John trying to place a pet student in an Ivy League school sleeps with a gatekeeper and baldly encourages nepotism; Portia in total agreement spends the entire movie secretly pulling strings. Would you root for these two? Imagine uncovering this plot at a college that rejected your child. 230 EntertainmentTrailer Admission Its odd that Fey so sharp and incisive on the small screen would choose a movie with such blinkered ideas.

PG-13 Language sexuality. Area theaters. The bad news about ""Admission"" is that this thin envelope of a comedy checks all the boxes for being a phoned-in phony padded rom-com. Change the higher-education setting and it could be a Sandra Bullock or Kate Hudson project from the last decade. The good news? Stars Tina Fey and Paul Rudd will likely be able to expunge this black mark from their permanent record. Fey stars as Portia Nathan an admissions officer at Princeton (which looks to have paid a years tuition to have such glowing treatment here). With a potential promotion dangled in front of her and pressure to deliver its Portias job to find the best and the brightest for the university which her boss (Wallace Shawn) frets has just fallen to number 2 in U.S. News amp; World Reports ranking. Portia has the time to devote to finding qualified students in her assigned Northeast quadrant since shes happily childless and her longtime boyfriend (Michael Sheen) is an effete fellow academic with minor demands. But then John Pressman messes up her well-ordered life. John (Rudd) is the founder of a crunchy New Hampshire progressive school pushing for his star student Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) to have a chance at Princeton. Though Jeremiahs education is unorthodox hes a smart kid. And even more crucially he just may be the one Portia gave up for adoption in college. This is the kind of test-your-patience premise that requires a coterie of would-be funny supporting characters and ""Admission"" dutifully delivers in the form of Sheen Shawn Gloria Reuben and Lily Tomlin as Portias feminist mom the kind just waiting for a chance to reconnect with her polar-opposite daughter. Karen Croners script -- adapted amazingly from a novel -- lets them all have their spotlight moment yet theres barely a laugh or a genuine emotion on view. Thats especially true of Portia whose brittle defense is supposed to melt thanks to Rudds everyman charm (on autopilot here but still welcome) and the possibility of being a mom. Instead she grows remarkably even less likable. Despite Feys expertise in self-effacing silliness she needed a better writer here (like maybe Tina Fey?). Yet director Paul Weitz is the real underachiever. Weitz and his brother Chris directed ""About a Boy"" and Paul went on to make the seriously terrific relationship drama ""In Good Company"" and the spot-on cultural satire ""American Dreamz."" Clearly Weitz can do better than a lazy rote vaguely classist space-filler like ""Admission"" which gives a smiley-faced Hollywood gloss to the imbalances in higher education. The film doesnt ever challenge anyone especially the audience to apply themselves. Magic moment Fey tries to calm down a cow in labor. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

That smirk of hers always suggests a joke is in the offing and if her work on Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock have taught us anything it is that the joke will usually kill. But when Fey is trying to convey serious emotions as occasionally demanded by her role as beleaguered Princeton admissions officer Portia Nathan in the quasi-comedy Admission the smirk hovers -- but only barely. Whether its in a necking scene with co-star Paul Rudd or a contemplative moment about the child Portia gave up for adoption 18 years earlier theres this sense that Fey might at any moment break the fourth wall turn toward the audience and say ""Me doing sexy and somber. I know. Right?"" As an audience weve made it clear that we love and admire Fey. She may not have always looked like a movie star but she does now. Perhaps not the way Naomi Watts looks like a star but Hollywood has plenty of history with women who have sharp strong features Barbara Stanwyck Bette Davis Joan Crawford Glenn Close Meryl Streep -- the list goes on. Yet Fey remains a smart performer with a limited (if still untapped) range. In non-comedic scenes on the big screen she conveys insecurity. But the truth is shes so appealing that I didnt mind sitting through Admission another formulaic spin on Hollywoods 21st century discovery the mom-rom-com with its disagreeable underlying messages about women careers and motherhood. (MORE Tina Fey Rocks On) Sex scenes and somber moments dont exactly dominate Admission. In adapting the source material Jean Hanff Korelitzs much more thoughtful 2009 novel director Paul Weitz (About a Boy) and screenwriter Karen Croner (One True Thing) chose to play up the comic aspects of Portias story. Fey doesnt have that much to do in the way of dramatic acting although when she does she makes even kissing Rudd seem like a task. Theres an eager forced pep here like you might see in an essay accompanying an application to a prestigious school like Princeton. When Portia is introduced shes living an unencumbered intentionally childless life with her English-professor boyfriend (Michael Sheen who played one of Liz Lemons jerky boyfriends on 30 Rock). Portia has been ""leaning in"" for ages and is now competing against a colleague (Gloria Reuben) to replace the retiring head of admissions (Wallace Shawn). She gets a call from John Pressman (Rudd) the director of an alternative school in New Hampshire and a former classmate from Dartmouth whom she doesnt remember. Hes got a high school senior he thinks she has to meet Jeremiah Balakian (Nat Wolff) a self-proclaimed autodidact with an abysmal GPA. (MORE Paul Rudd Everybodys Buddy) The first of two radical departures that Croners screenplay takes from Korelitzs book is to eliminate Portias mounting belief that Jeremiah who was adopted as an infant is her son and instead have John confront Portia with his theory that Jeremiah is that child. (Shed thought that the secret of her pregnancy was safe with her college roommate.) His detective work is invasive and creepy. ""You dont just barrel into peoples lives like this"" Portia says after she has recovered enough to speak. ""This is bad form."" Its also wildly inappropriate; Portias job requires her to be objective and John in a very pushy way is asking her to toss her professionalism out the window. He wants Portia to usher Jeremiah through the admissions process and be his second mom. Im not giving away anything about the plot (assuming youve seen the trailer) but Korelitzs handling of the Jeremiah mystery was far more graceful and plausible; in the book Johns only goal is for Jeremiah to get a good education. Maybe this tacked-on plotline explains why this is the first time Ive ever found Rudd unpleasantly smarmy. Nor does his passion for getting Jeremiah into Princeton make any sense. Then again a lot of things about the movie dont make sense though the admissions process begins in the fall and continues through the spring on the East Coast of Weitzs imagination the weather never changes and no one ever complains during their frequent trips about the four-hour-plus drive from Princeton to New Hampshire. (MORE Youre Not the Boss of Her Tina Feys New Memoir) Bothersome logistics aside what particularly doesnt sit well with me is the way the movie strips a strong character of her agency and turns her into a caricature of a needy helicopter parent albeit one hidden in the shadows. Believing John is right about Jeremiah Portia becomes obsessively moony about him. In place of the usual rom-com montage of a couple falling in love Weitz shows Portia in a montage in which she shops for books about teenagers and tries to make friends with other moms an about-face from her antipathy for the maternal (which stems from her own mother a parody of a feminist played uncomfortably by Lily Tomlin). The underlying message in this transition from book to movie theres something wrong with a female character who doesnt want children. (The screenwriters task creating comedy in an ambitious woman who capitulates to motherhood.) Even Portias heartbreak at the hands of Sheens wimpy character -- he leaves her for a colleague she calls ""that vile Virginia Woolf scholar"" -- is played mostly for punishing laughs. Every time she runs into her old partner shes in some humiliating position like vomiting on a dorm lawn. While Admission remains the story of a woman who comes to question her past choices and jeopardize her career the movie version is lighter fluffier and dramatically inert. Ill refrain from saying anything about the twist at the end the other radical departure from Korelitzs novel except that it feels mean and strange as though another trick has been played on poor Portia. If this is as I suspect a result of tailoring the material to Feys known talents I wish the filmmakers and the star herself had had more faith in her capabilities.

Movies Admission by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr MISSION CONTROL Tina Feys life spins off its axis playing opposite Paul Rudd in the comedy Admission (David Lee) Admission Posted March 29 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT There have been so many shrill dumb rinky-dink romantic comedies that its easy to feel downright grateful when a smart non-cheesy one comes along. Admission a likably breezy campus movie directed by Paul Weitz (About a Boy) is blissfully non-insulting. The film is set at Princeton University and Karen Croners screenplay which is based on Jean Hanff Korelitzs novel crackles with the sound of very clever people trying to outtalk each other -- an all too rare and happy thing to encounter in a Hollywood movie. Portia Nathan (Tina Fey) is one of Princetons elite team of admissions officers. She has the job of helping to choose which of the colleges more than 26000 yearly applicants all of whom believe they deserve a place in the Princeton pantheon are going to get in. (Approximate acceptance ratio 1 in 26.) In this academic sellers market Portia holds the power but so much is riding on her decisions that the pressure of sorting through all those high school seniors with their hilariously overstuffed extracurricular resumes (and their even more obsessive parents) has strung her tight. Feys sweet-and-sour line readings at first sound like Liz Lemon redux and I was glad for the moment when her 10-year relationship with a twit of an English professor (Michael Sheen who also played one of Lizs disastrous boyfriends on 30 Rock) crashes and burns. The breakup unhinges Feys character and liberates her performance. From that point on shes falling apart -- or at least falling into a pit of desperation -- and the neurotic crack-up looks good on her. It gives almost everything she does a shimmer of spontaneity. John Pressman (Paul Rudd) a teacher at a woodsy alternative New Hampshire high school called New Quest is Portias opposite a do-gooding globe-trotter who believes in the kind of excellence that cant always be measured by grades or ""official"" achievement. Hes pushing one of his students for admission to Princeton; the kid Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) is a prodigy with a troubled background and John and Portia begin to tussle over his future from the moment they meet. John thinks that Jeremiah may be Portias son and the battle as far as it goes is lively. But then just about every character in Admission has an enjoyably feisty intellectual attitude from the wily dean of admissions (Wallace Shawn for once not used as a walking punchline and all the better for it) to Portias switchblade-sharp office rival (Gloria Reuben) to the precocious students at Johns school who question Portia about Princeton being a ""corporation"" devoted to the status quo (a witty skewer-the-establishment scene). That Portia answers their gripe every bit as tartly demonstrates that the movie holds its traditional-versus-free-thinking priorities in a nice yin-and-yang balance. Admission has a promising first half and the movie springs a real wild card in Lily Tomlins brashly cutting and funny turn as Portias mother who wears her die-hard 70s feminism like a suit of burlap armor. Tomlin totally lets go. Her performance is an inspired satire of boomer self-righteousness and at the same time an unapologetic celebration of it. Line by line Admission is often fresh yet its also in its non-pandering way one of those films that are so diagrammed arc by arc and beat by beat that a soggy predictability begins to settle in. For a while Fey and Rudd spark each other but the bantering flirtation loses heat. I think thats because Portia as written has a genuine edge to her whereas Rudd with his smiley sincerity is stuck playing too nice and flawless a guy. John would have been a more logical romantic foil if hed had a pesky holier-than-thou side. Even with this soft-boiled romance at its center Admission really is a movie about whether Jeremiah with his lowly grade-point average and astonishing AP test scores is going to get into Princeton. And here Im afraid the films values are a bit out of whack. It makes us pine for that ideal of Ivy League opportunity a dream that it hangs on the issue of Jeremiahs admission. But what if he didnt get in? Surely he could go to some other good college. (He would seem perfect for Oberlin.) For a movie thats out to tweak the control-freak nature of the college-application process Admission in the end bows down far too slavishly to it. It confuses achievement with acceptance.

Portia Nathan (Tina Fey) is an admissions officer at Princeton University and she takes her position as gatekeeper seriously. So much so in fact that she hardly has time for a personal life. But perhaps thats just as well Her live-in boyfriend Mark (Michael Sheen) seems more interested in patting her on the head than in getting her undressed.She prompts much greater enthusiasm from John Pressman (Paul Rudd) who runs an alternative high school. He hopes Portia will consider his most promising student Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) to be Princeton material. But John also wishes to pursue a relationship with her that has nothing to do with evaluating grades and test scores.As if thats not enough for Portia to deal with she must also compete with her persnickety colleague Corinne (Gloria Reuben) to replace the soon-to-retire dean of admissions (Wallace Shawn). Ultimately Portia is forced to figure out just who she is and come to terms with whats been missing in her life.Part romantic comedy and part character study ""Admission"" -- based on a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz -- never coalesces into a satisfying whole. Working from a screenplay by Karen Croner (""One True Thing"") director Paul Weitz (""Being Flynn"") has trouble maintaining momentum and his stars dont help matters. Fey who rose to fame on ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""30 Rock"" just doesnt have the acting chops to pull off a character as complex as Portia. One can only wonder what Amy Adams or Kate Winslet might have done with the role. And Rudd who was great in ""Our Idiot Brother"" (2011) seems to be merely going through the motions. Only Lily Tomlin as Portias feminist icon mom truly finds room to shine.

Lily Tomlin steals the show in Admission review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLily Tomlin steals the show in Admission reviewTina Fey and Paul Rudd co-star in Admission an uneven rom-com with a side of drama. Lily Tomlin steals the picture as Feys feminist mom.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. March 21 2013AdmissionStarring Tina Fey Paul Rudd Nat Wolff and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Paul Weitz. 107 minutes. Opens March 22 at major theatres. PGFresh off now-wrapped 30 Rock Tina Fey teams with This is 40s puckish Paul Rudd for Admission a romantic comedy that doesnt live up to its serious ambitions to reach outside the genre for some deeper meaning beyond screwball antics and kissy-kissy.Following up big-screen comic turns in Baby Mama and Date Night Fey stars in the story of tightly wound Princeton admissions officer Portia whose by-the book rigidity and quest for transparency is suddenly muddled by a body slam to her ethics.Article Continued BelowThe comic rewards are there in the early going for those who are missing Liz Lemon. But when Admission stumbles which it does often aiming low for easy laughs at the price of missed opportunities to go deeper the picture lays there uninspired like a slice of boiled ham.Worse perhaps because shes our funny-smart SNL wonder woman Fey falters in her romantic scenes with Rudd where the screenwriter Karen Croner cant resist having her lob zingers when shes supposed to be concentrating on locking lips. Its as awkward as watching a Tyrannosaurus rex learn to bowl.No such problems arise with Lily Tomlin whose low-key acerbic delivery as Portias radical-feminist mom Susannah (complete with a hilarious tattoo) is the movies highlight.Haphazard directing from Paul Weitz who went from About a Boy to bottom-trolling for cheap yuks with Little Fockers in less than a decade has to take a good chunk of the blame for Admissions poorly connected vignette-like setups. A little more depth and less predictability -- witness fussy Portia gradually pruning her desktop bonsai to death to show us she has maternal-deficit issues -- would have helped.The story is based on Jean Hanff Korelitzs 2009 novel about those who channel academic hopefuls willing to do anything to gain entrance to those ivy-covered walls through the soul-killing chutes of Princetons admissions office.Judge not as the saying goes. Theres some cutthroat competition going on behind those tightly shuttered office doors too. Admissions dean Clarence (The Princess Brides Wallace Shawn) is about to retire launching a cage match for his desk. Portia and her chief rival Corinne (Torontos Gloria Reuben) square off. They ruthlessly comb the country to discover the best and brightest grist for the Princeton mill.Portia doesnt get much encouragement at home from her professor-boyfriend Mark (pompously self-absorbed Michael Sheen) who pats her head at the end of the day and otherwise ignores her.Looking to mine some intellectual gold Portia follows up on an invitation from a former college classmate John Pressman (Rudd) to check out the (very) alternative New Quest school. Its a quirky place where milking cows and creating sustainable water systems are as valued as solving math problems.Portia barely remembers John but he has no such memory lapses. Remarkably he even recalls the day and time Portia gave up her son in a hush-hush adoption after a college pregnancy -- information hes used to deduce his star pupil Jeremiah (Nat Wolff playing pleasingly nerdy) must be Portias kid.Social misfit Jeremiah is the oddest duck in the pond given to awkward vocal ramblings and free associations. But his weirdness cant hide the shining beacon of his intellect or his open-hearted sweetness. Hed like to go to Princeton but his marks light a path to remedial classes at a hillbilly college.Can a woman who would rather eat nails than bend rules muzzle her inner cop enough to help slide her son past the gatekeepers of the toughest school admissions process in the country? Pulled back from comedy into dramatic territory what Portia does with this newfound information forms the moral dilemma at the heart of Admission. It also provides some of its best onscreen moments as she tries to deal with the demands of her job vs. her own moral code her newfound role of mother and her dealings with Susannah -- who steadfastly refuses to name the man who fathered Portia during a chance encounter.Susannah may be a minor character but her presence in Admission is so terrific she deserves her own movie. Or perhaps a talk show. Or even a lecturing slot at Princeton how to steal a movie.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Admission movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Admission wait-listed on the way to greatness  1/2 Admission Tina Fey and Paul Rudd star in ""Admission."" Tina Fey and Paul Rudd star in ""Admission."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A fraught romantic comedy shot through with anxiety about getting your child into an Ivy League school or else ""Admission"" stars Tina Fey as a Princeton University admissions officer with a secret. Her genial foil is Paul Rudd who runs a rural New Hampshire high school thats a progressive Eden of alternative educational grooviness. How these two nice attractive funny people find each other is up to the machinery of the source material a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz adapted with mixed success for the screen by Karen Croner and directed with a calming glow by Paul Weitz whose attention to relational detail was evident in ""About a Boy"" ""In Good Company"" and more recently ""Being Flynn"".Besides talent and charisma and all that whats so great about Fey and Rudd? With both I think their huge appeal lies in comfort and precision. Fey the spikier and more vinegar-based of the pair boasts an improvisation aces deadly acumen (the good kind of deadly) in timing a rejoinder and sealing a moment with just the right punctuation. Rudd brings a related skill set but hes a warmer presence even when hes going for broad strokes in something like ""Our Idiot Brother."" The challenge for Fey and Rudd in ""Admission"" is in finding a looser more sincere quality suited to a seriocomic (and ultimately flawed) fable of privilege and the privileged few. The story begins with Portia Nathan the Fey character explaining in voice-over the heartbreak and satisfaction of what she goes through with each new admissions process. She lays out the acceptable platitudes she conveys to fretful parents and their high-achieving offspring taking the latest Princeton applicants tour. ""If this is the right place for you"" she says fully aware of the implicit lie ""this is the place youll end up.""Portias live-in boyfriend a professor played by Michael Sheen treats her like a dog -- literally; he pats her on the head and calls her loyal -- and is about to leave their bed for that of a humorless Virginia Woolf scholar. On a recruiting road trip Portia visits the New Quest alternative high school run by John Pressman (Rudd) her college classmate. Theres an especially promising and quirky New Quest student (Nat Wolff) applying to Princeton. John has reason to believe this may be the same boy Portia gave up for adoption. Does he tell her? If so when? ""Admission"" nudges Portia and John together as well as Portia and the Princeton hopeful Jeremiah as Feys increasingly reckless character wrestles with academic politics (shes up for a promotion; Gloria Reuben is excellent as her undermining rival) and personal ethics (helping Jeremiah get into Princeton constitutes a whopping conflict of interest).""I like stories of screwed-up people who think they dont have anything to offer emotionally but who cobble together an unconventional family"" director Weitz wrote in the production notes for ""Admission."" Theres a good movie in this story. The one that got made is roughly half-good. Fey and Rudd almost make too much sense together on screen; theyre smooth to the point of frictionless. The film tips between gentle satire of the admissions process and heartfelt pathos and although the two arent incompatible on paper on screen its a tussle. Weitzs direction isnt helped by the antsy choppy editing by Joan Sobel. Why so many reaction shots? Do we really need this much help?Its easy to watch because Fey and Rudd individually and sometimes together ensure a level of ease and confidence. But ""Admission"" is the tale of a woman losing it and then regaining it. Fey despite her enormous talent never seems to lose it in a way that would activate her characters riskier messier impulses. (You wonder what Lily Tomlin who plays Feys difficult mother in ""Admission"" mightve done with the role a generation ago.) And while the film positions Portia as an island of relatable sanity amid poseurs and sniffy hypocrites make no mistake It comes down firmly on the side of doing whatever it takes to get into Princeton.mjphillipstribune.comAdmission -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for language and some sexual material)Running time 150Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Tina Fey Entertainment Movies Princeton University Admission (movie) Michael Sheen Nat Wolff Who are the early Oscars 2014 favorites?

Share Tweet As the head writer of a sketch-comedy show on 30 Rock Tina Fey played a woman who served as both the thin wall separating her workplace from anarchy and an agent of chaos herself. It was her existential lot in life to keep everything together for her coworkers while just barely holding it together herself. Admission an adaptation of Jean Hanff Korelitzs novel toys with Feys persona in compelling ways by casting her as someone who has adopted order as a religion who sees the world as an incredibly complex system of rules and codes that must be followed to the letter at all times or else disaster will ensue. For Fey the orderly life is the only life worth living but the world proves an awfully messy place no matter how diligently she attempts to stave off the innate chaos of existence. Fey stars as a driven 37-year-old Princeton admissions officer who has devoted the last 16 years of her life to her job. Her career has become her identity; even her relationship with professor Michael Sheen seems like an offshoot of her position with the university. Then Fey travels to an alternative high school run by Paul Rudd an idealistic but troubled world traveler who pushes hard for Fey to develop a relationship with Nat Wolff an intense young student Rudd suspects may be the grown-up incarnation of the baby Fey gave up for adoption while she was still in college. When Sheen leaves her and Rudd begins to pursue her Fey is forced to reexamine her life and confront the decades of dissatisfaction and loneliness shes been assiduously repressing. Lily Tomlin always a force of nature roars through the film as Feys hurricane of a mother an impossibly demanding tyrant who attempts to pass off cruelty and selfishness as radical self-reliance. Reduced to a broad outline Rudd sounds like an impossible dream man a dashing big-hearted do-gooder complete with an adorable precocious pre-pubescent son (Travaris Spears) he adopted during a stint in Africa. But the film suggests that Rudd has psychological damage of his own to contend with and that his raising of Spears merely represents the autocratic parenting of his own father in a friendlier more palatable new form. As a character study of a rigid professional woman in the midst of a personal meltdown Admission benefits from fine lead performances deft characterization and a solid grasp on a very specific cultural milieu. The films depiction of the growing mother-son bond between Fey and Wolff is funny and affecting but while it eschews sentimentality the film falls apart in a ramshackle lumbering final act thats alternately too messy and too tidy.

In Feys case the curse comes in the form of ""Admission"" which is both a comedy that isnt funny and a love story that never sparks; its serious moments might have worked in a smarter movie but here they represent only a jarring shift in tone. Would that Fey had been as choosy and critical about the screenplay by Karen Croner (""One True Thing"") as her character is about personal essays attached to applications to Princeton University. Portia Nathan (Fey) has spent years standing at the Ivy League colleges gates seeking out the nations best and brightest high school students and ruthlessly culling the ones who dont measure up. This school year promises to be a challenging one not only is Portias boss (Wallace Shawn) retiring leaving her to compete with office rival Corinne (Gloria Reuben) for a promotion but Portias English professor boyfriend Mark (Michael Sheen) has also just dumped her for colleague Helen (Sonya Walger). Adding to her complications is an encounter with an old classmate John Pressman (Paul Rudd) a globe-trotting do-gooder whose current project is an alternative school in the wilds of New England. He gets her to do a school visit mainly so she can meet Jeremiah (Nat Wolff of ""The Naked Brothers Band"") an enthusiastic pupil who has blossomed from D-student to self-taught genius. John thinks Jeremiah would be perfect for Princeton; he also thinks that Jeremiah is the son that Portia put up for adoption when she was an undergrad. As with ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" ""Admission"" offers situations that are ripe with comic potential and talented performers who are more than capable of bringing the funny while offering very little in the way of laughs. Were never made to care very much about Portias romantic or workplace problems -- whereas we absolutely cared about both in regards to Liz Lemon on ""30 Rock"" -- and while Rudd and Fey are eminently empathetic and charming performers their romantic chemistry never clicks. Also irritating is the weirdly misogynistic streak running through the film. Taylor Swift and Jezebel.com notwithstanding Fey has earned a reputation as a smart and ferociously funny feminist so its more than a little annoying that the female supporting characters are so lazily drawn Portias mother Susannah (Lily Tomlin) is an old-school Womens Libber with a Bella Abzug tattoo (and cats named for Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan) but she goes from firebrand to simpering ninny after just one night of passion with a studly Russian professor. The only other women of consequence are Corinne and Helen both two-dimensional gorgons. Director Paul Weitz when collaborating with his brother Chris showed a real deftness for witty adult comedy in films like ""About a Boy"" and ""In Good Company"" but here the jokes tend to clang and the dramatic bits -- particularly a rather hateful confrontation between Portia and Susannah -- come flying in out of nowhere. Everyone involved in ""Admission"" has done far better work in the past and will with any luck succeed again in the future so maybe ""Denial"" would have been a better title for a movie thats going to be missing from a lot of resumes.

Or is some inexorable force of Marxian historical overdetermination at work compelling Steve Carell and Tina Fey to make the kinds of sub-mediocre machine-produced formula pictures that would once have starred Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston (and may yet) and so rendering irrelevant all the qualities that made them irresistible on television?Im being slightly unfair to ""Admission"" a rambling well-meaning and largely unfunny Ivy League comedy that tries to establish Fey - famed for her Sarah Palin impersonation on ""Saturday Night Live"" and her star/writer/creator role on ""30 Rock"" - as a rom-com leading lady. That doesnt turn out to be a good idea but my actual point was that Vince Vaughn would never have taken the role Paul Rudd actually plays as the do-gooder founder of a crunchy alternative high school in the New England woods. The movies just too boring and middlebrow; theres not enough sports talk or jokes about how chicks are maddening and gays are you know so gay.Indeed if ""Admission"" has anything going for it at all which is debatable its precisely that quality of PG-13 niceness. You can take the kids you can take grandma; everyone will be ever so slightly entertained. No demographic groups are ever insulted and abused with the brief possible exception of straight white men (who can take it frankly) and Virginia Woolf scholars in what I would argue is the only genuinely funny scene. Then again Rudds character an altruistic single dad with an adopted Ugandan son proves to be such a sterling example of straight white maleness that all of creation quails before his seraphic nature including Portia (Fey) a tightly wound Princeton admissions officer. The bitchy home-wrecking Woolf scholar (a bit part for Sonya Walger the leggy British star of ""Lost"" ""FlashForward"" and ""Common Law"") on the other hand goes unredeemed.Still I wish I understood the thought process behind making a movie like ""Admission"" which is directed by industry veteran Paul Weitz (of ""Little Fockers"" and ""American Pie"") and adapted by screenwriter Karen Croner from a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz. Actually I dont wish I understood it; thats a figure of speech. The film seems based on demographic guesswork generated by reading the first half of some navel-gazing trend article in the Sunday New York Times Women in their 30s and 40s are the romantic-comedy audience; those women are also Tina Feys fan base; theyre also the ""helicopter parent"" generation maniacally obsessed with steering their offspring into elite colleges. Eureka Comedy gold.Except that its hard to imagine anyone anywhere at any social stratum not being simultaneously bored and irritated by ""Admission."" Actual alumni parents and so forth of Ivy League institutions are not the audience envisioned for mainstream comedy lets face it and will find this movie inane and lacking any satirical edge. And who outside that rarefied realm would even theoretically be interested in this story and its setting? Especially in an era when most of us are facing the reality that even if our kids get good grades terrific test scores and develop cold fusion in their spare time theres no way on Gods green earth to pay for Princeton once they do get in. (Full disclosure My wife graduated from Princeton and did not emerge as a huge fan of the place.) You Might Also Like Fey isnt a disaster in a straightforward acting role but shes not all that memorable either. Portia is a damped-down character neurotic but not nuts and pretty but not sexy and Fey often seems nervous and edgy next to the sunny calm underacting of Rudd whos been good in a lot of roles in a lot of mediocre movies in the last three or four years. Control-freak Portia gets dumped by her bearded English-prof boyfriend (Michael Sheen) right about the time she meets John (Rudd) whos pushing an autodidact senior from his wood-chopping calf-birthing alternative high school in rural New Hampshire as a Princeton candidate. We see where almost all of this is trending right away but one of many reasons why the movie is dumb is that this kid a bright but strange reclamation project named Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) is clearly wrong for an ultra-competitive Establishment-oriented canal like Princeton. Even within the realm of elite education send him to Bard or Oberlin or St. Johns College or any of the other schools better suited to outsider genius types.But Princeton is our setting and theres some awkward comedy involving the outgoing admissions dean (Wallace Shawn) and his chagrin that the school has fallen to No. 2 in the U.S. News amp; World Report rankings. Then theres the fact - spoiler coming although the movies ad campaign gives it away for free - that John suspects Jeremiah may be the kid that Portia herself gave up for adoption years ago when she was herself an Ivy League undergrad. Throw in Travaris Spears as Johns adorable African sprat Gloria Reuben as Portias admissions-office rival and some saucy zingers from Lily Tomlin as Portias bike-riding radical feminist mom - a version of the role Jane Fonda played last year in ""Peace Love amp; Misunderstanding"" - and you have adequate setup for a vague feel-good comedy that lasts way too long without ever getting anywhere. One way of explaining the problem with this kind of movie especially relative to TV is that Hollywood producers at this budget level are still trying to broadcast to as wide an audience as possible so the academic jokes cant be too insidery and the 70s references have to be super-general and the supposed drama of ""Omigosh its impossible even for really bright kids to get into Princeton"" has to be rooted in bogus ideas about ""relatability."" Television comedy on the other hand remains inexpensive to produce and is often aimed at a narrow demographic slice of the viewership (""Girls"" would be the example of the moment). None of that explains why ""Admission"" runs at least a half-hour too long and isnt funny mind you. And the results of all this overthinking can be paradoxical The finale of Feys ""30 Rock"" drew about 4.9 million viewers which isnt all that great for network TV. But faced with the bad reviews and blah word of mouth theyre about to get the producers of ""Admission"" would take that in a heartbeat. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Portia (Fey) a Princeton admissions officer is Liz Lemon redux high-functioning overclenched sexually neglected. Her longtime professor manfriend (a finely aloof Michael Sheen) pats her on the head like a sheepdog and when he finally runs out on her she accuses him with the kind of sharp revealing line this movie could have used more of ""You had unprotected sex with that vile Virginia Woolf scholar?"" From there the movie bats Portia around like a pinball either as the bearer of a sarcasm only she possesses or as an emotional wreck several years late to the predictable grow-up-already lessons. Her obvious knight in shining armor a progressive prep-school teacher (Paul Rudd) shows up too easily and is too patient while scenes with a tough-talking mother (Lily Tomlin) reduce Portia to a mopey mess shorn of zingers. Admissions comedy has walls built around it; director Paul Weitz (About a Boy) normally a softener of harsh edges might have been stymied by Feys snappy persona. The plot hinges on a teens potential acceptance at the university but youll stop wondering if the kid is actually our heroines offspring (from a secret adoption) given that Fey herself seems on the waiting list for performative maturity.

Unless she is exceedingly glamorous a la Charlize Theron she can all too easily get stranded in the land of mom roles Hair twisted into a messy bun shes perennially grabbing her purse to whisk the kids off to soccer or dance; meanwhile the dog has grabbed the meat off the counter--again That on-screen image is a cartoon distillation of the trade-offs women make in real life These movie women are exhausted but theyre happy. As is often true in real life children give movie moms a sense of meaning and purpose and most important an easily discernible role to play.Tina Feys character in Paul Weitzs Admission doesnt have that easily defined role; this not-quite-a-comedy presents her childless state as almost a tragedy. Fey is a killer comic actress--she could probably start and stop your watch with nothing but brain-waves. But even though she brings much more to the role than the movie asks of her Admission doesnt have the courage to suggest that a childless woman whos doing work she loves just may have it all--or at least her all.Fey plays Princeton admissions officer Portia Nathan a character who admittedly doesnt quite love her work though she doesnt know that yet. Her job doesnt mean seeking out the most deserving students or even the best qualified; whats crucial is finding the right mix of pedigreed stock (to keep the Princeton brand valuable) and appealing mongrels with high SAT scores (presumably to meet quotas). She believes the gig is fulfilling her but its really just wearing her out. On top of that she has a cozy but dull--and childless--life with her significant other played by Michael Sheen a whiskery elfin academic who chuckles to himself as he reads the Canterbury Tales prologue aloud in bed in Middle English no less. (Sheen is scarily good at this.)Film Details Admission RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time117 More Info Trailer Whats missing from Portias life? Might it be ... a child? It doesnt help that her S.O. runs off with an icy Woolf scholar--shes regularly referred to as ""that Woolf woman""--whom hes impregnated (with twins). But heres another thing that Portia doesnt know yet that she might be mom material already. An old college classmate John Pressman (Paul Rudd) the half-twinkly half-insufferable principal of an alternative high school in the wilds of New Hampshire has contacted her about one of his students a weird but obviously brilliant kid named Jeremiah (played with the right elixir of gawky charm by Nat Wolff). Pressman believes Jeremiah might have a shot at Princeton. He also drops the bomb--and what follows constitutes a minor spoiler--that Jeremiah might be Portias son the now-teenage version of the baby she gave up some 16 years ago. Once she begins to see--or just imagine--herself in him Portia begins pulling Ivy League strings for Jeremiah beyond what shed do for any other student.It would be more than enough for Admission to tangle with the idea that this socially inept economically disadvantaged extraordinarily bright kid is just what the Princeton student body needs--and what the admissions system guarantees Princeton is unlikely to get.The fact that Jeremiah may be Portias flesh and blood is supposed to intensify the storys moral complications. But really what difference does it make? Wouldnt Admission be more potent if the heroine took action on behalf of a kid in need who wasnt her own? The movie flirts with the idea that Portia simply by seeing a spark in him and fighting for his chance to get into a great school has helped Jeremiah greatly by not being his mother. But it cant shake the idea that actual parenting is the nobler effort. A contrast is built in Rudds Pressman a globe-trotting do-gooder has adopted a kid from Africa and faces his own problems as he strives to be a good parent. Even progressive globally conscious people buy into every old notion of family and child-rearing chiefly that it automatically makes you a better person.Admission does land a few punches At one point Portia cannily plays the ""sisterhood is powerful"" card with a conniving ambitious colleague (played with gloriously sinister undertones by Gloria Reuben); the idea a subversive one is that sisterhood is powerful particularly when a sister has something to gain from it. Lily Tomlin and Wallace Shawn show up in amusing third-banana roles. And as shot by Declan Quinn the picture is handsome-looking--Princetonian even.But Weitz an openhearted director if not always a precise one cant bring himself to whet the knives. Only Fey drills to the center of what Admission might have been--her performance has more layers of emotion than the picture does.Great comic actresses--like Barbara Stanwyck or Barbra Streisand--can have a direct line to feelings wed rather not air or even acknowledge. Fey is on that track; her Portia is both maddening and deeply sympathetic--theres warmth behind her crispness even if its not the fresh-baked-cookie kind. If Admission were sharper it could be the ultimate Mothers Day movie a picture about a nonmother who cares deeply for the next generation even when it hasnt sprung directly from her own womb.Follow VoiceFilmClub Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Waitlisted Tina Feys Admission is disappointingly by-the-numbers. _ By David Edelstein Published Mar 23 2014 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Focus Features) Its depressing to watch performers whove carved out their own distinctive niches try to broaden their appeal by doing the same damn thing as everyone else. Take Tina Fey in Admission which could be her application to the school of mainstream rom-comedy. She plays Portia Nathan a Princeton University admissions officer (for sixteen years) with a patronizing professor boyfriend (Michael Sheen) and an aversion to kidsseveral of whom are hauled in for the sole purpose of letting her be averse. In part because her job consists of rejecting exponentially more students than she admits Portia has been able to keep life at bay remaining brittle judgmental and emotionally insulated. This makes her ripe for breaking inhumanizedby a nonconformist do-gooder heartthrob (Paul Rudd). In other words Fey has the Sandra Bullock roleexactly the kind of part that she has spent the last decade transcending. Shes not bad in it though. Shes actually very good in the second half when Karen Croners hitherto formulaic script begins to go in darker less expected directions. But youre still conscious that shes wasting a good part of her brain. That first half of Admission is a lot for an actress to overcome. Its not just very bad its very fast as if someone had overwound the metronome. Fairly naturalistic lines are delivered at the pace of screwball zingerswhich stubbornly refuse to zing. Portia is in a fierce competition with the even-more-driven Corinne (Gloria Reuben) to succeed the current dean of admissions (Wallace Shawn) which is why she ends up (highly improbably) at New Quest a low-profile agriculture-oriented New England alternative high schoolshe wants to show her boss that she can broaden the applicant pool. Teacher John Pressman (Rudd) thinks she should get to know a weird but brilliant student named Jeremiah (played by former medium teen idol Nat Wolff). He also thinks she should get to know him. Hes smitten from the get-go. Rudd is one of the movies biggest problems not because hes so wrong but because hes so right. Face it Everybody doesnt like someone but nobody doesnt like Paul Rudd. He could beat a puppy to death onscreen and youd worry about the ill effects on him. In Admission hes an idealistic international humanitarian who has adopted a Ugandan orphan and spends his days teaching sustainable irrigation while stopping to deliver calves. And his family is richalthough his values are such that he distances himself from them. But hes rich. And single. And not gay. And Paul Rudd. And he adores her. And Portias boyfriend has knocked up a colleague and moved out. And hes Paul Rudd. The course of true love never did run this smooth. When Portia is just uptight a mass of nerves Fey is fun enough but nothing special. But she and Admission take a great leap forward when Pressman informs Portia that Jeremiah might be the son she gave up for adoption in college. (This isnt a spoilerits in the previews.) Suddenly Portia is at odds with herself unable to reconcile her wild new emotions with her hard-won super-stable personaand Fey is brilliant at showing what happens to single-minded people when forced to hold dual thoughts. She really comes into her own in the scenes between Portia and her mother (Lily Tomlin) a first-line feminist scholar who proudly discourages her from forming lasting relationships with men. This might seem like classic feminist-backlash material if the actresses werent Fey and Tomlin who carry the mantle of feminist self-respect in every gestureand who also know that just because youre an admirably strong woman doesnt mean you cant also be hilariously addled or plain bonkers. Its when Portia decides that her alleged son belongs at Princeton that she becomes most seriously bollixed upand Admission raises creepy (and ever pertinent) questions about who gets into prestigious colleges and why. The process is so ugly that its surprising no one bothers to say that there are schools other than Princeton. Director Paul Weitz finally stops the metronome and lets the absurdity of the whole situation sink in (though not the pop songs sprinkled like MSG over everything as if by a chef whose palate has been dulled by fast food). Atrocious spoiler alert Fey and Rudd become a couple. Admission Directed by Paul Weitz. Focus Features. PG-13. Share this story...

Tina Fey plays a discombobulated Princeton admissions officer who must confront the limits of her morals when she learns that a potential Princeton applicant might be the son she gave up for adoption. What appears on paper to be an ideal three-dimensional morally complex role for the quick-witted comedienne backfires in practice relying on Fey to be funny in a movie that works better serious. Despite offering consolation to the worlds many Ivy League rejects that the gatekeepers sometimes make mistakes low entrance levels await. Clearly what Weitz wanted was to recapture some of Feys ""Baby Mama"" mojo (it earned a surprise 60 million after all) relying on the actress to bring the same vulnerable uncertainty to another harried working-woman role. But that film was conceived as a traditional laffer whereas ""Admission"" is based on Jean Hanff Korelitzs more nuanced novel in which Feys seemingly straightlaced character is thrown for a loop by a highly unusual applicant. While the book treats the maternity wrinkle as its big surprise the more plot-driven adaptation serves it up as a central concept positioning Feys Portia Nathan as an increasingly screwball character struggling (and mostly failing) to maintain her professional ethics amid a messy personal crisis. Through a series of clunky on-the-nose character-development scenes the pic establishes Portias life -- or more accurately her current state of denial Shes fallen into a predictable routine with her tweedy lit-professor b.f. (Michael Sheen) her fastidiously clean workspace and her general intolerance of kids. Instead of indulging auds natural curiosity with a look inside the closed-door world of college admissions the pic leaves Fey and her co-stars to play dress-up in a wood-paneled office where Wallace Shawn amiably poses as the dean of admissions and everybody carries around orange folders like so many hyper-efficient Oompa Loompas. The impression essentially favors Princeton as it reveals the fair yet relatively inflexible process by which Portia and rival Corinne (Gloria Reuben) evaluate high school seniors essays and extracurriculars. Each folder conjures a fresh optimistic-looking teen at the edge of the readers desk the majority of whom then plummet through an invisible trapdoor after failing to meet the high threshold. With Portia and Corinne competing for a promotion Portia throws herself into her usual visits to prospective students giving the same canned speech at every stop until she arrives at New Quest a newly accredited -- and highly experimental -- school overseen by fellow Dartmouth grad John Pressman (Paul Rudd). Implausibly John remembers the day and hour Portia gave her baby up for adoption and has somehow managed to match it to his star pupil a freakishly smart but terribly awkward teen named Jeremiah (Nat Wolff). But Pressmans timing in revealing the information couldnt be worse Not only is this a sensitive time at work but Portias b.f. is searching for an opportunity to break things off and her long-frazzled relationship with her mother (Lily Tomlin) is coming to a boil all of which drives Portia to behave as only movie characters do sobbing smooching and puking at the most inopportune moments. Other New Quest students question the value of what they see as the sexist racist homophobic institution Portia represents but Jeremiah wants to attend Princeton. Problem is he lacks the grades to get in. Watching the final admissions process one wants to believe the officers become this invested in everyone they consider. And yet Portia goes to extremes to boost Jeremiahs chances manipulating co-workers and even breaking in to alter his file. The comedy feels forced as Fey works overtime to insert unnecessary zingers at the tail of every scene. If the cast werent so endearing her actions could easily sour an audience on the whole experience and ""Admission"" digs itself a hole only an ensemble this appealing can escape. Tomlin in particular enlivens her limited screentime as an irrepressible free spirit -- a woman who truly understands the meaning of acceptance.

""Admission"" earnestly straddles the line between both worlds with characters as defined by uncharacteristic outbursts and plot-stalling misunderstandings as they are their distinctly established families whether those families are accidental adopted or altogether absent. The Weitzes best stuff -- ""About a Boy"" and ""In Good Company"" -- tends to strike that critical character-driven balance but as a dramedy this one is equal parts amiable and weightless tough to take seriously and yet light on honest laughs. Of course perhaps its unfair to assume that the pairing of Tina Fey and Paul Rudd might instantly result in the Funniest Movie Ever Made. Director Paul Weitz is aiming for something a bit more grounded as Princeton admissions officer Portia (Fey) goes about contending with the fact that John (Rudd) the persistent founder of a progressive school in upstate NY and an old college classmate thinks that he has a prodigy on his hands in the form of Jeremiah (Nat Wolff). Furthermore hes convinced that Jeremiah is the son that Portia gave up for adoption so long ago a revelation which sends her orderly career into a tailspin. In adapting Jean Hanff Korelitz novel of the same name screenwriter Karen Croner (""One True Thing"") tries to contrast Portias potential ethical compromise on the eve of a promotion against her abandonment guilt and to present a possible relationship with the more impulsive John after she finds herself ditched by long-time boyfriend Mark (Michael Sheen all awkward grins) in a very public fashion. With Fey in the role of harried singleton though its hard to avoid comparing Portia to ""30 Rocks"" Liz Lemon or the baby-crazed professional she played in 2008s much broader ""Baby Mama"" and while shes clearly aced romantic neuroses as a comedienne all her fluster feels a bit too twice-baked this time around. Rudd shoots for sincerity but between his mealy-mouthed approach to giving Portia the big news and glaring lack of consideration for the conflict caused by dropping a personal bomb on a college admissions officer and then asking them for an application advantage its hard to root for his character no matter how well he means or how often he moves (much to his adopted sons chagrin). To his credit Wolff manages to be convincingly intellectual without succumbing to social paralysis; Wallace Shawn and Gloria Reuben are appropriately stiff as Portias academic colleagues; and Lily Tomlin very nearly walks away with the whole kit and kaboodle as her free-wheeling mother whose cavalier ways are as much as a defense mechanism as Johns wanderlust or Portias workaholism. Every once in a while Weitz keys on an off-kilter vibe such as a birthday party that offers the one-two punch of Jeremiahs perfectly inert philosopher ventriloquism and the sudden appearance of a dove room -- its exactly what it sounds like -- or when one imagined applicant smugly reminds Portia that her father is both Cuban and in a wheelchair. Actions do have their consequences though and Weitz doesnt try to end things too tidily for their own good. Were only that he had succeeded in committing to one of those films over the other then ""Admission"" might have been this years ""Liberal Arts"" rather than this years ""Smart People.""

Daily Edition Login to download Admission Film Review 600 AM PST 3/6/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS ""Admission"" Focus Features An erratic comedy about the minefield of college admissions. TWITTER Tina Fey and Paul Rudd star in the college-set comedy from director Paul Weitz. Deftly playing Tina Feys feminist-icon mother Lily Tomlin all but steals Admission a knowing but uneven comedy about the neuroticism of the college-admission process on both sides of the equation. The foibles of supposedly intelligent adult characters cause humor to erupt at odd moments throughout this quasi-farcical look at high-end academia but director Paul Weitz betrays an erratic grip on the comic tone and the misguided central characters emerge in the end as less likable than they ought to be. By its nature already limited in appeal to mostly upscale middle-aged audiences this Focus release will be challenged to push beyond modest returns in specialized release. Karen Croners adaptation of Jean Hanff Korelitzs novel springboards off the panic and mania that seize students and parents alike when it comes to competing for prized slots at American institutions of higher learning. However the focus here is not on parents and some of the kids competing with 20000 others to get into Princetons class of 2016 but rather on one of the admissions officers Portia Nathan (Fey) who will help decide their fates. At the same time shes vying with another colleague Corinne (Gloria Reuben) to replace the retiring dean of admissions (Wallace Shawn). VIDEO Admission Trailer Tina Fey Has a Son and Paul Rudd Has a Crush Weighed down with reams of applications but primly organized and efficient Portia has been doing this for years and has her rap down pat about how there is ""no secret formula"" for getting in you just have to ""be yourself"" and so forth. However Portia is a tightly wound woman whos about to completely unravel. On a tour of high schools she swings by ultra-alternative New Quest to visit teacher and former college classmate John (Paul Rudd) whos got an exceptional student Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) he hopes she can champion at Princeton. The adopted kid of working-class parents hes an autodidact with bad grades but perfect test scores. Unfortunately two consecutive scenes that vitally change the course of Portias life and that of the film are highly contrived and awkwardly managed. Mixed signals between Portia and John result in a botched sexual encounter trumped by John informing Portia that hes discovered shes Jeremiahs biological mother. Then when Portia rushes home to help her English department chairman hubby (Michael Sheen) host a reception he chooses this public moment to mention that hes leaving her for another woman who is both present and already pregnant. Tailspinning Portia has enough trouble maintaining her composed professionalism without all the continued badgering from John who in a less-than-hilarious slapstick interlude back at his overweeningly sustainable utopia forces her to help birth a calf. Endlessly wallowing in his globe-trotting do-gooding and political correctness John is annoying enough so as to require all of Rudds natural charm to make the character even partially palatable as a romantic lead. Ultimately Johns imploring as well as some long-dormant motherly instincts push Portia into ethically challenged territory as she champions Jeremiahs acceptance at Princeton a process that ultimately puts several characters through the wringer with presumed life lessons learned all around. Apt ironies and well-aimed satiric japes co-exist with excessive artifice and clumsy execution in a tale populated by characters in possession of far more education than common sense. The life role Portia has constructed for herself over many years is fragile enough to crumble virtually overnight John never has escaped his own indulged upbringing Portias husband is a moral weasel and academia is littered with backbiting hypocrites. STORY A Former Child Star Dodges Teen Perils Leaps From Nickelodeon to Admission Although her character is as deeply flawed as the others the one performer who truly rises above the fray here is Tomlin. Her Susannah the author of a landmark tract called The Masculine Myth is a hilariously blunt-talking professional feminist who sports a Bella Abzug tattoo and has never revealed to Portia the identity of her father (allegedly a hot one-night stand on a train) and whom her daughter can tolerate in only the most limited doses. A dispenser of bizarre advice and adorned with newly acquired fake boobs she doesnt quite know how to wear Susannah is a hedonistic narcissist Tomlin has great fun elaborating. For her part Fey seems a bit tense and tentative in a role that never comes entirely into focus. Traumas such as Portia being dumped by her husband as well as her sexual relations with John are played for arch comedy and in spite of the omnipresence of adopted kids pregnancy and students we never know how she really feels about having given up her own child as a teenager or the prospect of having any more. Rudd basically wrestles Johns obnoxiousness to a draw while Olek Krupa is appealing as a manly Russian professor whos just Susannahs type. Given the films often critical attitude toward elite universities and some jokes at the schools expense its mildly surprising that Princeton cooperated and allowed the production on campus. Much of the same crew that worked on Weitzs previous film Being Flynn -- including cinematographer Declan Quinn production designer Sarah Knowles costume designer Aude Bronson-Howard and editor Joan Sobel -- have helped turn out a nice-looking film on no-doubt modest means.
