After some pedestrian scene-setting Lone Survivor hits its stride as the mission begins. Whatever the moral implications of presenting extreme physical destruction as entertainment few films can lay claim to such a sustained technically impressive rendering of the consequences of combat on the human body. Its most bracing scene bolstered by appallingly realistic stunt work and effects sees the Seals tumble down a seemingly endless hill. Lone Survivor isnt always sophisticated. Some of the dialogue is unbearably cheesy while the use of real-life footage is manipulative. But theres moral complexity as the Seals clash on ethical grounds and a climax in an Afghan village which is tense and surprisingly moving. Neither an anti-war tract nor a jingoistic rallying cry the brutal but humane Lone Survivor instead registers as a howl of despair for so many young men and women lost in war.

I think it was a very good idea to show actual footage of men training to be Navy SEALs during the opening credits. It gives the viewer audience very good insight into just how difficult and brutal the training is and it makes you appreciate the brave and tough soldiers who go through it even more. Mark Wahlberg is very good as Marcus Lutrell. The battle scenes doa great job in showing what Lutrell and his fellow SEALs endured during a frightening ordeal. However I disagree only slightly with Richard here. I would give the movie a ""B"" rather than a ""B+"". I just saw a little of ""Black Hawk Down"" in this movie. Also the final climatic battle sequence is recycled right out of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Still ""Lone Survivor"" is a very good movie that should not be missed. ??????said on Wednesday April 23 2014 22100 AMintresting and exciting film.

Having captured three hapless goat herders who came across their position the team -- Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster) -- argues over whether to keep these two young boys and one old man tied up take them all out or let them loose and risk being tracked down by Shah and his forces. Murphy ultimately opts for the latter and hopes for the best asking aloud afterwards ""Isnt that how things work? Good things happen to good people?"" Of course as the title of both the film and Luttrells own memoir reveals very bad things happened instead and Berg renders each punishment with a fierce nearly fetishistic amount of detail and distress. After all to quote a fellow frogman ""moderation is for cowards."" ""Survivors"" centerpiece is a half-hour-long firefight that sees our boys navigating mountainous Afghanistan terrain in pursuit of a communications signal that could save their asses unifying the actor-turned-directors established reverence for clearly presented action geography (""The Kingdom"" ""The Rundown"") and military might (""The Kingdom"" ""Battleship""). This crucible reinforces the sense of camaraderie portrayed on base between these men and their fellow officers (Eric Bana and Alexander Ludwig among them) in those few moments when the action itself isnt running the gamut from exciting to exhausting from noble to numbing. Between the equally -- almost interchangeably -- gruff performances the severe sound and stunt work and some wince-worthy make-up effects from the rightfully revered KNB team its an impressive ordeal to rival the most harrowing moments of ""Black Hawk Down."" Alas the prolonged carnage equally evokes the likes of ""The Passion of the Christ"" and whats worse Berg and company struggle throughout to walk the line between honoring individual feats of bravery and glorifying wartime brutality. The film goes a full ninety minutes before introducing any turban-clad villager that doesnt immediately present a threat (including a conveniently heroic moppet); each of the three main casualties expires with their own slow-motion moment of martyrdom accompanied by Explosions in the Skys endlessly triumphant score; and the amount of Taliban foes is distinctly embellished from reported figures all the better for anyone who gets a hard-on at the sight of Hadji headshots. Generally devoid of any greater political context the film doesnt do away entirely with subtlety. Two beats of typical sentimentality are literally blown open by artillery -- after all combat knows no such preciousness -- yet Berg nonetheless bookends the mission with a 3-minute intro of real SEAL training and a 4-minute coda set to an especially mournful Peter Gabriel cover of ""Heroes"" each moment just daring the viewer to question any dramatic contrivance amid such documented sacrifice. ""Lone Survivor"" ultimately seems at war with itself torn between its duties as an entertaining engaging movie and a somber sincere memorial and in splitting the difference the film effectively assaults its audience almost as aggressively as its subjects.

"Dirty War << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous NFL Divisional Preview Part 2  Next The Trouble With Rog Facebook Twitter Print Movies Dirty War Lone Survivor and Peter Bergs you-are-there combat filmmaking by Wesley Morris on January 10 2014 What responsibility do the movies have to faithfully or accurately depict war? To some extent none. Most war films convey a sense of the grand futility of it all -- the death and destruction the endlessness and possible pointlessness the mutation of any political religious or social objective. Many depict the waste of life and money with a profligacy of their own. Apocalypse Now still looks like it cost as much as the Vietnam War. But some look past moral philosophy and budgetary excess. Some war movies see only soldiering heroes and want us to set aside the larger questions of costs and outcomes for celebrations of courage. Lone Survivor is that kind of film. Its so narrowly focused on a single incident during the war in Afghanistan you cant see past the stress in the faces of the films four Navy SEALs. The camera gets right up close to the actors playing these men and gives you quaked quivering images. When they go crashing down the side of a steep forest hill the camera goes with them. The films director Peter Berg wants to immerse you so deeply that you feel as if your bones are breaking too. Theres a price of course for that kind of immersion It becomes tough to see the movie for the drum-beating. The introductory sequences in Lone Survivor are spent on training passages. They dont appear to be Bergs. They look like video footage of actual soldiers shivering keeled over barely breathing and nearly drowned. ""Keep going"" someone screams. ""Youre our band of brothers"" says someone else. These are the stakes Berg appropriates This is real. The movie is based on an actual 2005 incident recounted in a book by Marcus Luttrell with Patrick Robinson Lone Survivor The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10. Luttrell is the lone survivor of a Taliban ambush. Berg tries to replicate the intimacy of the books first-person account (Mark Wahlberg plays Luttrell). Thats how you wind up feeling clipped onto the SEALs utility belts. But the attempt to move from the reality of military footage to the realism of movie combat costs the film its coherence. This is really three movies. One establishes the camaraderie among the men on the base. The stages of the mission are laid out. Jokes are told. And vaguely the atmosphere of a Terrence Malick film is evoked particularly when by way of narration Wahlberg pins poetical manliness on a montage of militariness. ""There is a storm inside of us"" he says in that Wahlberg whisper ""a burning a river a drive an unrelenting desire to push harder than a man can think possible."" He goes on ""We wanted ... the hottest most unpleasant of the unpleasant fights."" That fight occupies the movies middle and it is unpleasant -- grueling too. Luttrell and three other reconnaissance and surveillance SEALs played by Ben Foster Emile Hirsch and Taylor Kitsch find themselves under attack. A scouting mission becomes one of extraction. And as these four try to shoot their way out (we rarely see who exactly is shooting at them) you recognize the impossibilities of the Afghan landscape and the nature of the overwhelming tactical advantage the Taliban fighters have. The bone-cracking plunges along the rock faces have a kind of vivid gruesomeness. Berg stages a couple of these tumbles. And you can tell that among everything Berg admires about these men their indestructibility ranks pretty high. For two of its three acts this is a serious somber movie. The filmmakers have been talking about the tribute they felt compelled to pay not just to the 19 Americans who died in Operation Red Wings (as the campaign is officially called) but to the might and sacrifice of the entire American military. To that end most of Lone Survivor has a muted curious blandness (I suspect Berg would call it ""reverence"") thats new for his big-footed heavily muscled action entertainments. In Lone Survivor the manly comedy at the naval base vanishes suddenly -- as does your ability to distinguish Wahlberg from Kitsch and Hirsch from Foster. The blood dirt and hair on their faces make them interchangeable. That feels strategic There is only the team. But the lack of human inflection has a peculiarly lulling effect. Nothing stands out. Bergs you-are-there approach is similar to one the journalist Sebastian Junger and the late photographer Tim Hetherington used for their 2010 Afghanistan war documentary Restrepo for which they embedded themselves with an army battalion. That film was memorable for its dire sunlit firefights and captured both the practical and existential terror of modern combat. It also eavesdropped on the private homosocial rituals that bond these men to each other. The brutality and harrowing uncertainty became a mild intoxicant. The directors were war journalists (Hetherington died working in Libya in 2011). They knew the moral and ethical boundaries. They disliked the war but succumbed to fascination with it. Restrepos subjectivity was suffocating but it hung together as a snapshot of battle. Berg seems to be feeling his way as he goes. He wrote the screenplay and seems penned in by admiration by the facts and possibly by the movies direct involvement with Luttrell who acts in a small role. The resulting film is somewhere between docudrama and infomercial not unlike the fictional all-SEALs-cast action-thriller Act of Valor. But in its way that movie as outrageous as it was worked. It swaggered and rumbled. It brandished its military authenticity. Berg didnt make it but that was a Peter Berg movie. That Lone Survivor feels so deferential should be to his credit. But realism just isnt a style that suits him. You miss the unself-conscious brio he applied to The Rundown and The Kingdom and the frizz and melancholic thunder of Friday Night Lights. Its not that Berg needs to express the ambivalence about power that say Captain Phillips does. Its more that here Berg needs to express something in addition to thanks. Berg needs to flex his unself-consciousness. That suspicion of deference is what has some people exasperated with The Wolf of Wall Street that Jordan Belfort gets to participate in the party Martin Scorsese is allegedly throwing for him. But its no party for Belfort. Its a rambunctious sliming. Bergs submission to the SEALs is probably his only moral option. He just struggles to make his respect compelling. Once the operation truly gets away from the SEALs the movie sheds its watchfulness and by the last act turns into the sort of action thriller youd expect from Berg and that Berg probably expects of himself. But he has unreliable control over the point of view and the films tone. It climaxes amid the houses of an arid Pashtun village and an observant fairly contemplative tribute to survival becomes adrenalized commercial chaos. The villagers decide to take on the Taliban in order to protect one of the SEALs. There is a little boy who befriends Luttrell and pushes things into preciousness. Nonetheless the very brief debates that go on among the Pashtuns feel refreshingly thoughtful for an American war movie -- even if all that these ethnic men are doing is arguing about whether to save or sacrifice a white American. That argument and its outcome situates Lone Survivor within a long history of American movies in which ethnics circle the wagons around an outsider; Mel Brooks made a scathing joke of it 40 years ago this year. These 15 to 20 minutes of Lone Survivor could have been Bergs entire movie. Instead they comprise a dismaying set piece that aligns the movie with emptier blockbusters more unexamined waste. This is Luttrells life but at the movies his life has become another Hollywood ending.

In an early training montage Berg lingers on the young Navy SEALs sinewy limbs and ripped torsos marveling (in slo-mo) at their ability to endure pain with manly near-miraculous stoicism. The prep for war is itself a near-death experience and its transmutational. These ordinary American guys -- guys guys with pretty wives and loving families -- are reborn as supermen. Luttrell played onscreen by Mark Wahlberg was the only SEAL standing (barely) after a 2005 Afghanistan mission to assassinate a murderous Taliban warlord went wrong. Nineteen Americans died and Berg uses every cinematic weapon in his arsenal to make you feel each bullet as it rips through the warriors bodies defiling young flesh that he has previously hallowed. The Taliban fighters take single shots to the head or chest and are dead before they hit the ground; the SEALs stay up eviscerated but seemingly invincible. It is only the Alamo-like imbalance of forces that finally brings them down and even then their deaths are ""good."" Theyre radiant as they take their last shallow breaths. War has ennobled them. Im not being snarky or ironic when I say to Marcus Luttrell ""Thank you for your service."" Its important to separate the men described in his book from their depiction in movies like Lone Survivor which is crudely written rife with cliches and leaves out anything that would transform a piece of propaganda into a work of art akin to Samuel Fullers The Steel Helmet Brian DePalmas Casualties of War or Steven Spielbergs Saving Private Ryan. Berg has no gift for staging battle scenes. He substitutes crunch and splatter for coherence. He turns the actors into fodder. In one scene Berg intercuts the clear open (albeit bearded) faces of Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Ben Murphy and Emile Hirsch as they listen to the details of the operation with shots of the targeted warlord (Yousuf Azami) dragging a man from the bosom of his family and hacking off his head before the eyes of the victims son. The whole movie is on that level. The problem is not that Taliban leaders never behave that way; its that cartoon villains do. Its an insult to the nineteen fallen Americans to make the object of their mission look like a Central Casting hood in a Grade C Steven Seagal movie. Luttrells book (written with Patrick Robinson) doesnt question the U.S. strategy or tactics in Afghanistan and the author is especially enamored of then-Commander-in-Chief George W. Bush as both a leader and a man. Thats his perspective and he has earned the right to share it with the world. But Peter Berg has no excuse for not widening the perspective. The film doesnt link the absence of air support and the near-total failure of communication in the mountains to an administration that diverted personnel and precious resources from Afghanistan to the catastrophic occupation of Iraq leaving men like Luttrell with a tragically impossible job. Nor does it suggest that one reason good guys like Luttrell and his team had such a difficult time winning ""hearts and minds"" was that at places like Bagram -- where this SEAL team was based -- prisoners were being tortured to death by U.S. interrogators in the service of Dick Cheneys ""Dark Side"" manifesto. Instead Berg leads you to the conclusion that these Americans were just too good too true too respectful. Luttrells operation -- and his teams lives -- might have been saved if theyd summarily executed three passing goat-herders rather than following the Rules of Engagement. I cant imagine a single person watching the subsequent wave upon wave of Taliban fighters with their RPGs and machine-guns and not thinking If only the Americans had put two bullets in the head of each of those guys theyd be home with their wives and kids today.A Lone Survivor is a brutally effective movie made by people who think that theyre serving their country. But theyre just making us coarser and more self-centered. Theyre perpetuating the kind of propaganda that sent the heroes of Seal Team 10 to their deaths.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post    Drama Rated R. 120 minutes. ""Lone Survivor"" begins with a series of credit-roll scenes of Navy SEAL training. Ring the bell three times if you want out. Place your helmet on the ground. More than a few hardy rock-solid souls sound that bell. Which is part of what makes the SEALs such an elite warrior class. The film then shifts to the extraction of a grievously wounded soldier by helicopter. His voice-over ruminations kick in the light in his eyes flickers. The bloodied face of Chief Petty Officer Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) fills the screen. The movie flashes back as he appears to flatline to a time days before the U.S. special forces saw one of its deadliest days June 28 2005. At Bagram base in Afghanistan theres casual touching camaraderie between the men of Navy Seal Team 10 but also the folks back home. Lt. Michael Murphy takes a laptop into Luttrells room to discuss the wedding gift his fiancee more than hints shed like a horse. Even the quasi-hazing of newbie Petty Officer Shane Patton has levity. Director Peter Berg (""Friday Night Lights"" and ""The Kingdom"") adapted Luttrells 2007 memoir of bonds forged and lives lost ""The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10"" co-written with Patrick Robinson. The films title is no bait-and-switch. Luttrell was the only one to make it out alive -- with the aid of a seemingly unlikely ally. In trying to rescue the men from the area more personnel died. If this story sounds familiar it could be because youve chosen to pay heed to the loss of life incurred during our militarys time in Afghanistan and Iraq. Or it may be because among the SEALs killed was Littletons Danny Deitz. (See sidebar.) Emile Hirsch portrays the 25-year-old communications specialist. Luttrell Murphy Dietz and Second Class Petty Officer Matt Axelson (Ben Foster) are sent to gather information on an al-Qaeda operative who has begun to effectively kill American soldiers. Shortly into the teams time in the scree- and scrub-covered slopes of Kunar province three goat herders wander upon the unit. And the film hinges in many ways on a moral quandary. It is quite possible that the right thing ethically -- releasing the three herders -- was not the right thing tactically. Berg does a good job posing his -- and Luttrells -- most painful kind of ""What if?"" without belaboring it. They release the goat herders and things go to hell fast. The performances are muscular in a film where action begins to take over not because of miscues by the director but precisely because thats what can happen in warfare. Though not an exquisite piece of cinema -- and it doesnt have to be to be powerful -- ""Lone Survivor"" shares some of the unrelenting qualities of ""12 Years a Slave."" Directed with care for its protagonists (and by extension all those who loved and honor them) this film still plunges the audience into the violent predicament of its protagonists and keeps us there. There are intentionally long scenes in which the action unfolds with chaotic fury. This is not ""war-porn"" pretty. The onslaught can be disorienting desperate. As it should be. Bergs fine achievement is in relaying that sense of abject danger even as he and his actors honor the utter connection of the men who lost their lives that day.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 10 2014 1201AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 10 2014 734AM EST Comments AA Directed by Peter Berg Written by Peter Berg Starring Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch Classification 14A Country USA Language English The sensation of being pinned down and shot apart is so harrowingly conveyed by Peter Bergs fact-based war movie Lone Survivor that one almost forgives the movies failure to be quite as persuasive in almost every other respect. This is a contemporary war-is-hell account in which hell burns so intensely that it scorches the firewalls of the mundane world around it. But it doesnt burn them down. On June 28 2005 four American Navy Seals were sent on a mission in Afghanistan to locate and if feasible kill the heavily guarded Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. When their precarious mountainside location was stumbled upon by goat herders the men were quickly surrounded and attacked by the enemy. The ensuing skirmish was brutal The Seals were largely exposed on an almost vertical mountain slope their enemys numbers and ammunition were seemingly unlimited and communicating with base operations was impossible. Only one Marcus Luttrell - played with grim low key conviction by Mark Wahlberg - would live to tell the tale write the book and share the nightmare.It has of course components of the sturdiest American stories of them all bravery under fire facing impossible odds standing proud even in the face of slaughter. But part of it is also a cliche a myth as old as the Alamo and the true test of that myth is how it holds up against the cold scrutiny of truth and experience. And its a myth that writer-director Berg for all the intimacy with which he wishes to acquaint us with the sensation of being shot to bits doesnt even try to test.As played by the bearded quartet of Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch the Seals are standard-issue American boys unwavering in their pride of service preoccupied with wives and family back home and almost entirely incurious about why theyre in this horrible predicament in the first place. No questions are asked about the larger cause of this war or the wisdom of its execution and even the movies sole passage of uncomfortable self-reflection when a tense discussion transpires about whether to kill or free the hostages is silenced and rendered moot once the shooting starts.When it does however the mountain combat is rendered with such frightening force immediacy and ferocity that nothing matters other than the second-by-second struggle to stay alive. And what better definition of damnation is there than that an eternity of slow-drip fear in the here and now. But even hell has a context so its a pity that Lone Survivor ignores it. This hell like all of them on Earth had its enablers and the grim fact is that they usually survive as well.

"Lone Survivor is more than a war movie Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLone Survivor is more than a war movie Review Lone Survivor comes on like another exercise in empty jingoism for director Peter Berg but this true-life Afghanistan War account has considerable nuance. Taylor Kitsch left as Michael Murphy and Mark Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell in a scene from Lone Survivor based on a failed operation in Afghanistan.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 9 2014Lone SurvivorStarring Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Emile Hirsch Ben Foster Eric Bana and Ali Suliman. Written and directed by Peter Berg. Opens Jan. 10 at Toronto theatres. 122 minutes. 14ALone Survivor comes on like a raised fist.Peter Bergs Afghanistan War drama opens with scenes of Navy SEALs undergoing brutal training. Drill sergeants bark orders that leave no room for doubt or subtlety ""Turn it into aggression Whatever you have to do just find an excuse to win"" Above all SEALs must band together.Article Continued BelowIt seems like another exercise in empty jingoism for Berg whose last directorial exertion saved the Earth from rampaging aliens in the summer 2012 bomb Battleship. Hes no stranger to wartime situations or rhetoric amplified over the past decade in such rumblers as The Kingdom and Lions for Lambs.Yet Lone Survivor represents a significant change for him perhaps because its based on the thoughtful memoirs of now-retired Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell the sole man left breathing out of 20 U.S. soldiers caught in a 2005 firefight in the mountains of Afghanistans Kunar province.Luttrells first-person writing doesnt hesitate to wave the stars and stripes but it isnt the work of a man with delusions of grandeur. Its the hard-earned account of someone who knows that on the battlefield the best of intentions often fall before unforeseen circumstances. Morality is always a moving target in war and frequently its first casualty.For all of its macho intensity visceral imagery and realistically booming bullets chopper blades and falling bodies -- the film deserves awards consideration for sound design and editing if nothing else -- Lone Survivor isnt just another war movie. The title may seem like a video game challenge (or a plot spoiler) but theres a lot more going on here than that and considerably more nuance.We see the conflict from both sides although the American one gets the most screen time and our immediate sympathies. Mark Wahlberg plays Luttrell part of a ""fire team"" quartet of SEALs dropped by helicopter into a mountainous Taliban stronghold. The others are team leader Michael ""Murph"" Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) gunners mate Danny ""Danny Boy"" Dietz (Emile Hirsch); and sonar ace Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson (Ben Foster) all of the actors almost unrecognizable behind scruffy beards.Its called Operation Red Wings and theyre tasked with covertly taking out a top Taliban leader humorously code-named ""Rick James"" after the late ""Super Freak"" funkster. Then theyll be efficiently extracted by helicopter. The plan seems sound although Axe mutters there are ""a lot moving parts.""A lot of movie formula has gotten us to this point -- male-bonding feats of endurance ritualistic hazing gals-back-home placating and military strategizing -- but the picture turns on a single situation where the four SEALs meet three wayward goatherds and confront a life-or-death decision.Do they ""terminate the compromise"" and avoid having the goatherds blow their cover to the Taliban? Or do they obey the Geneva Convention and allow these non-combatants to go free?Bergs screenplay lists all the hawks versus doves arguments with Luttrell and Murphy taking the moral high ground and Dietz and Axelson arguing the case for situational ethics. They try to contact their commander (Eric Bana) back at Bagram Air Field but hes unreachable.The actors really sell this scene most impressive of all being Kitsch whose measured intensity goes a long way to redeeming an acting career besmirched by Bergs Battleship and by the Disney misfire John Carter.In showing what happened next to these brave and determined men in scenes both thrilling and ghastly Berg continues to exhibit admirable self-control. Hes not preaching to either Republicans or Democrats although you might guess where he stands on military funding when a character complains that budget cuts mean there are ""not enough Apaches"" to rescue stranded soldiers. Hes also not trying to second-guess Operation Red Wings although it seems clear the op needed more planning better communications and better support from the top military brass.Nor is he out to demonize the Afghan people. He shows how one of them a villager played by Ali Suliman (The Kingdom) helped prevent this from being a story about zero survivors.Berg is recognizing and perhaps fully accepting for the first time that the acrid smoke of war never completely lifts even when you are staring into the face of your supposed enemy.The real Marcus Luttrell talks about the movie Lone Survivor E4.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Peter Bergs rousing shallow well-made film may be hell to sit through but its part of a long Hollywood tradition of commemorative combat films--soldiers stories that grieve for fallen brothers and find hard simple truths in notions of sacrifice and courage. The problem is that the wars we fight now arent simple and the best recent movies about them arent simple either.

Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) gets treated by Gulab (Ali Suliman) and his young son (Rohan Chand) in ""Lone Survivor."" Photo Universal Pictures Lone Survivor review War films title tells us too much 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Lone Survivor Drama. Starring Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Eric Bana Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch. Directed by Peter Berg. (R. 121 minutes.) The title of ""Lone Survivor"" is accurate enough but it has an inevitable impact on how the movie is experienced. It tells us going in that all the main characters are going to be killed except for the fellow played by Mark Wahlberg. Yet its a full 85 minutes of screen time before Wahlberg actually becomes the ""lone survivor."" Before that we watch as the men - Navy SEALs on a 2005 mission in Afghanistan - try different things and hope for the best while we sit and know the worst. Based on a memoir by former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell ""Lone Survivor"" is in many ways a fairly straight-up war movie something that could almost be called old-fashioned. Its about a group of guys who know and trust each other who have all endured elite training have mutual codes of behavior and a shared sense of humor. The script expends much energy on making each man vivid to the audience before we watch them all get thrown into a dangerous situation. In this case theyre on a mission to either capture or kill a Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. Yet three things make ""Lone Survivor"" different from most old war movies and not for the best. The first is that title. The second is the war itself. Although the Afghanistan war is one that the vast majority of Americans endorsed it doesnt have the feeling of a great national struggle for survival like World War II. The third is that the movie is not about citizen soldiers - average guys drafted to do a dirty job that just has to be done. Its about Navy SEALs which sets up a whole other kind of expectation. The appeal of the SEALs at least as a movie subject is that theyre not regular guys that theyre amazing and can do things regular military people cant as in Kathryn Bigelows ""Zero Dark Thirty."" But ""Lone Survivor"" from start to finish is a tale of disaster of bad luck and bad communication perhaps even faulty planning though thats hard to say. So the movie loses the common touch of average folk trying to get by while also losing some of the pleasure of watching a crack unit at work. Director Peter Berg takes us into the world of the SEALs which is of moderate interest. All people like to believe in their own toughness but few of us ever know for sure. These guys do. As the movie shows their training is mentally and physically brutal and their powers of concentration are intense. The movie recounts a real 2005 operation gone bad and the punishment these men endured is beyond belief - perhaps literally so. According to the movie most of the men sustained multiple bullet wounds and still managed to trek long distances and put up a strong fight. After an introduction where we meet the guys the next hour is devoted to combat scenes which are well executed especially in the way they create within the viewer a fear and dread of the enemy. Berg keeps his camera on the men and on their perspective so that were always surprised when they are surprised - and alarmed when we see the brief flash of a Taliban soldier dashing from one rock to the next. The actors especially Wahlberg as Luttrell and Ben Foster as Matt Axelson are convincing in their humanity agony and ferocity but there is no escaping a sameness that sets in by the second or third time the men are shown tumbling down a stone hill and landing on rocks. We might look through the movie toward appreciating what the actual men went through but that alone cant turn ""Lone Survivor"" into a satisfying movie experience. Nor can it compensate for the ongoing damage done by a title that casts all the action in futility and doom even before it happens. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Four Navy SEALs -- from left Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) Matt Axelson (Ben Foster) and Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) -- become stranded while on a mission to kill a Taliban leader in ""Lone Survivor."" (AP) By Michael OSullivan January 9 2014 Theres a trend in movies this awards season apart from the welcome abundance of awards-contenders with an African-American -- or simply African -- theme (""Lee Daniels The Butler"" ""Fruitvale Station"" ""12 Years a Slave"" ""42"" and ""Mandela Long Walk to Freedom""). It first popped up this past fall with back-to-back releases of the dramatic thrillers ""Gravity"" and ""All Is Lost"" each of which centers on heroes -- stranded in one case in space and in the other in the middle of the ocean -- who are visited by one increasingly grim disaster after another until it seems that things can get no worse. Add ""Lone Survivor"" to that list. Based on the memoir of Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell who is played by producer Mark Wahlberg the film tells the story of Operation Red Wings a disastrous 2005 mission to kill a prominent Taliban fighter Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami). As the title gives away the four-man team of commandos ambushed and stranded without communications on a remote mountain in Afghanistan is slowly agonizingly whittled away one by one until . . . well lets leave some things to the imagination. Luttrells comrades-in-arms are played by Ben Foster Emile Hirsch and Taylor Kitsch each of whom is barely recognizable behind the scruffy beards grime and blood that cover their faces. Inexplicably they wear no helmets. Is it hard to watch? My gosh yes and not quite in the way that ""Gravity"" and ""Lost"" managed to make their parades of catastrophes simultaneously awful and compelling. Unlike those films ""Lone Survivor"" is a loud and grinding affair seemingly as intent on wearing down its audience as the Taliban is on the films heroes. At times the violence is so unrelenting and fierce that its hard to believe that theres anyone left alive let alone with any bullets left to fire. Whats missing here is something or rather someone to care about. Written and directed by Peter Berg (""Battleship"") the film presumes our emotional investment in Luttrell and his fellow soldiers mission simply by virtue of -- well its never quite clear what. The questions of who exactly Shah is other than one of many murderous thugs and why we should care so deeply about his fate is never really explained in a way that grabs the imagination. Hes no Osama bin Laden in other words and this is no ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Even worse Berg gives us little reason to feel that we know the men who are hunting him beyond a few lame lines of dialogue about someones upcoming wedding. Theyre movie stars in camo pretending to be massacred for the camera. That anonymity worked in ""Zero Dark Thirty."" There it was about the missions high stakes not the personalties of the SEALs who carried it out. Here we need something -- Compassion? Commiseration? Connection? -- to leaven the monotony of the mayhem. The fact that things start to go south after the team is discovered by a young Afghan goatherder leading to an argument about whether to kill him doesnt do much to generate sympathy for these heroes. Even though the decision is ultimately made to let the kid go -- a decision that Luttrell may have lived to regret -- the fact that more than one of his pals seemed perfectly happy to shoot the child leaves a powerful and lingeringly bad aftertaste. Of course the film is supposed to be a tale of heroism. And in the end it is. Only the films real hero isnt Luttrell who survives unimaginable violence including a gruesome leg injury that requires pushing a bone back into place. I cant say more without spoiling things but ""Lone Survivors"" most fascinating character doesnt even appear until the films final minutes and is dealt with mostly in a series of whatever-happened-to titles that run on screen just before the closing credits.

Peters  Universal Pictures Taylor Kitsch left as Mike Murphy and Mark Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell in ""Lone Survivor."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Lone Survivor"" is gripping unrelenting brutally proficient moviemaking a just-the-facts war movie about four Navy SEALS on an Afghan mission gone fatally wrong. Director Peter Berg puts behind him the hyperbolic nonsense of ""Battleship"" to concentrate on the unsparingly detailed basics. No matter how furious the action were never unclear about each combatants location or what the next objective is. Even when explosions swallow barked-out commands and the action becomes nightmarishly concentrated were never in pandemonium. The film is scrupulously rendered chaos. It opens with what appears to be documentary photography of grunts undergoing the famously rigorous SEAL training that washes out all but the elite few. Efficiently it establishes the films four protagonists as men of admirable courage. Theres Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) whose memoir of the 2005 mission inspired the film; Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) the legendarily tough lead officer; pragmatic Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster) and baby-faced communications specialist Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch). The films title makes it clear that only one of the team will live to see the next Veterans Day but the inevitability of their deaths doesnt diminish the movies raw dramatic power. The recon team drops deep in mountainous territory to pinpoint the whereabouts of a vicious Taliban leader. Theres suspense in the very terrain as they cross treacherous peaks to reach their target. The mission briefing included warnings about rattlesnakes and even poison oak. Soon enough they are in a ""cursed mission"" where skin rash is the least of their worries. Losing radio contact with home base isolates them in hostile territory. They locate the Taliban chief and in turn their presence is discovered by goat herders. They debate killing the villagers but Luttrell objects. The rules of engagement forbid harming noncombatants and theres no way to conceal such a crime "" SEALs kill kids thats the CNN headline."" The decision is made the mission is compromised and a superior Al-Qaida force attacks. The bulk of the movie is an extended series of bloody battle scenes with each wound graphically presented. The effect of the incessant violence is to make the horror of war more horrible by showing its effects plain at close range. The actors never actorish whisper and shout their dialogue with a convincing blend of obscenity anger and desperation. LONE SURVIVOR 1/2 out of 4 stars  Rating R for strong bloody war violence and pervasive language. There are many opportunities to be melodramatically manipulative here but Berg sidesteps them. The story venerates its front-line warriors as clear-cut heroes. But the film strikes me as ideology-free. One person will see ""Lone Survivor"" as a rah-rah recruiting poster; another will interpret it as a sad testament to wasted blood treasure and human potential. Its tricky to read deeper meanings into a real-life incident yet theres a sense that fate rewarded Luttrells pardon of the goatherds when Pashtun Muslim villagers later save his life at a terrible cost to their tribe. Watching ""Lone Survivor"" is a shattering experience. How you jigsaw your fragmented emotions back together afterward is wisely left up to you. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Comments click to enlarge Lone Survivor Recommended Video Rated R  121 minutes  2014 Broadly speaking Hollywood war movies since the Reagan era tend to fall into three camps bloody fantasies a la the Rambo series that center on lone superhuman warrior-heroes; relatively bloodless spectacles in the vein of Top Gun showcasing the state-of-the-art technology developed by the U.S. military-industrial complex; and artful blockbusters like Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down that feature immersive re-creations of combat and seem designed to appeal to both prowar and antiwar viewers. The most interesting thing about Lone Survivor a Hollywood war movie opening in Chicago this weekend is that it doesnt really fit in any of these subgenres. Writer-director Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights Hancock) seems to have taken cues from such 1940s ensemble action dramas as Howard Hawkss Air Force (1943) and William Wellmans The Story of G.I. Joe (1945) movies that arent about war so much as the camaraderie sacrifice and thankless work that characterize life in the armed forces. Read more.

PETERS UNIVERSAL STUDIOS By MICHAEL SRAGOW / ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Lone SurvivorStarring Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Ben Foster Emile Hirsch Directed by Peter Berg Rating R for strong bloody war violence and pervasive language Running time 2 hours 1 minute Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitA virtuoso brutal rendering of a SEAL teams fight for life in a forbidding patch of Afghanistan. Grade A- Dont let the title of this rigorous engrossing movie turn you off. The opposite of the romantic-loner fantasy Mark Wahlberg pulled off in ""Shooter"" ""Lone Survivor"" is about a team of men who operate like a single multi-celled organism. After these four Navy SEALs locate a fearsome Taliban leader in a remote mountainous area their mission gets fatally compromised. They soon confront a rush of radical villagers and Taliban fighters who pop out from behind every tree and rock that circles their makeshift base on a mountainside. Theyre as trapped and outnumbered as the British soldiers in ""Zulu."" This film depicts group vitality and heroism from the clipped opening montage which illustrates the physical and mental toughness of SEAL training through the staccato battle that the SEALs keep waging with gusto even when theyre barely alive. The visceral momentum sweeps you into combat so graphic you would otherwise look away. Sam Peckinpah once said ""If Im so bloody I drive people out of the theaters then Ive failed."" Writer-director Peter Berg courts that danger as he molds this factual story to his strengths - rendering ripped-from-the-headlines trouble spots and subcultures with immediacy and realism. As a screenwriter Berg smartly adapts Marcus Luttrells first-hand account dramatizing action that takes up a mere fraction of its pages. The SEALs ethos of clinging to combat as long as they can breathe and using will to overcome pain courses through this squad like a shared bloodstream. As a director Berg brings a marksmans reflexes to his craft and a SEAL instructors discipline to his cast. Wahlberg who plays Luttrell is the ideal actor to anchor this ensemble - hes confident and generous with gravelly warmth. Taylor Kitschs understated nobility Ben Fosters surprising tenderness and frankness and Emile Hirschs touching befuddlement (he cant understand how the Taliban move so faaaast) fix them as individuals. You recognize them even when in desperation they hurl themselves off a cliff to the rocks below in search of a better battlefield. Berg and his editor Colby Parker Jr. deftly edit that piece of derring-do into one common painful prolonged fall - you see each of them bound and rebound off crags and trees until they come to rest on a shaky plateau. In that sequence and others Berg stuns you with the SEALs hardheaded hard-bodied daring. The movie is more like a piece of high journalism than a work of art. Its way of expressing the brutal relentless challenges of modern elite warfare is to become brutal and relentless itself. Yet ""Lone Survivors"" rocky integrity gets to you. In its own harsh harrowing way it pays heartfelt tribute to fallen heroes. When these superbly trained fighting men take bullet after bullet break bone after bone then lock eyes and assure each other ""Im good"" they renew the meaning of ""band of brothers.""

"Lone Survivor movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs REVIEW Lone Survivor Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg honor the story of a SEAL team tragedyJanuary 09 2014|Michael PhillipsScene from ""Lone Survivor."" (Universal Pictures)Roughly half of ""Lone Survivor"" is a standard-issue Hollywood treatment of a recent bloody and in human terms tragic 2005 Navy SEAL mission to eliminate an al-Qaida operative in the Afghanistan mountain region of Hindu Kush. But the other half -- the hour or so of writer-director Peter Bergs film dealing specifically with what happens when four men are cut off in Taliban country scrambling under fire -- is strong gripping stuff free of polemics nerve-wracking in the extreme.This is a straight hard do-or-die scenario vividly re-created by Berg. He adapts the best-seller ""Lone Survivor The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10"" written by Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson.Mark Wahlberg plays Luttrell. His fellow SEALs are portrayed by Taylor Kitsch Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch with Eric Bana as their commander back at Bagram Air Field monitoring what becomes a terrible ambush. Bergs movie gets through its introductions efficiently though without much in the way of character detail. We know from the start who lives and who dies; Wahlbergs Luttrell provides the voice-over at the outset while we see him being saved by a rescue team.The heart of the film is pure crisis and response. Kitsch plays Mike Murphy the special ops team leader; Foster the communications specialist Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson. Hirschs Danny Dietz gunners mate completes the quartet dispatched by helicopter to a remote mountainside perch near the village where their target has been spotted.And then it goes wrong. Theyre ambushed and for the better part of ""Lone Survivor"" we see them shot thrown down boulder-strewn inclines fight back attempt to regain a foothold. The actors know whats required of them. You wouldnt call an actor such as Foster an underplayer but Berg manages to get all his actors in the same movie and keep conventional histrionics to a minimum. The situations that make up ""Lone Survivor"" are harrowing to begin with; they dont need goosing.Berg shot the film in the mountains and sound stages of New Mexico and the size of the picture feels right for the scope of this true-life story. The adaptation doesnt make room for much beyond the kinetic horror of the ambush. When Luttrell meets a local villager (Ali Suliman) who harbors the American from the Taliban the movie takes a couple of shortcuts back into Hollywood territory. Sometimes things that really happened have a way of seeming slightly phony on screen.At its best though ""Lone Survivor"" accomplishes its mission which is to respect these men dramatize what they went through and let the more troubling matters of moral consequence trickle in where and how they may. (In one tense sequence the men debate the fate of goat herders they encounter.) Wahlberg remains one of our most reliable and least actorly of movie stars innately macho but vulnerable enough to seem like a human being caught in an inhuman situation. Bergs film pays attention to every setback every moment lost or won on that mountain.mjphillipstribune.com""Lone Survivor"" - 3 starsMPAA rating R (for strong bloody war violence and pervasive language)Running time 201Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesNorton Herrick boards Lone Survivor as producer Peter...November 14 2012Eric Bana circling Lone Survivor Thesp in talks to join...August 13 2012For love of country they accepted deathMay 25 2009Find More Stories AboutMark WahlbergTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-lone-survivor-0110-20140109,0,7204353.column",200,lonesurvivor17,lonesurvivor,chicagotribune

"Review Lone Survivor 4 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Review Lone Survivor 4 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Survivor Luttrell has battle scars Relatives of Lone Survivor SEALs attend screening By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Jan 30 2014 118 PM ""Can you fight?"" ""I can fight"" This all-important exchange runs repeatedly through ""Lone Survivor"" Peter Bergs harrowing action drama that depicts a real-life Navy SEAL mission in 2005 that went disastrously wrong. The title is a pretty good indication of that and although you will have to discover for yourself to whom the title refers it is not a great surprise given the structure of the movie which begins with a rescue operation. The actual beginning of the film consists of real footage of the insanely difficult training SEALs undergo; many of the snippets involve various forms of resuscitation. Eventually Berg puts us at a base in Afghanistan where a SEAL team goofs around while waiting for a mission. It arrives quickly in the form of Operation Red Wings. Four men will be set down in the mountains and lie low awaiting an opportunity to take out a Taliban leader (Yousuf Azami) and his second-in-command. We meet the four briefly before they head out Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) Matt ""Axe"" Anderson (Ben Foster) and Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch). They share the good-natured camaraderie of four friends who must entrust their lives to one another. They treat their assignment as a pretty standard mission without a lot of drama though at one point Axelson does note that there are ""a lot of moving parts."" Expectations of some communications problems are built into the mission so no one panics when the satellite linkup wanders in and out. More troublesome is something that wasnt built in the arrival of three shepherds one of whom is carrying a military-issue walkie-talkie. The SEALs must decide how to proceed. Do they let the shepherds go and run? Tie them up and leave them probably to die in the cold? Or do they simply kill them (""terminate the complication"" in their words) and continue the mission? The debate is heated and passionate. Eventually Murphy notes that it isnt a vote and issues his order They will cut and run. The results are disastrous. They are also not a surprise given the beginning of the film. However Berg immerses us so completely into the horror of these mens situation that we are gripped throughout. The fighting is incredibly intense. The men are battered bruised shot. They roll down cliffs slam into trees get shot some more. And yet they never waver. ""Can you fight?"" ""I can fight"" What at first seems like a boilerplate rallying cry becomes over time a soldiers attempt to convince himself that he is still in the fight. And he is. Because as Luttrell repeats often you are never out of the fight. To some this may sound absurd. To these men it is anything but. Bergs film doesnt make any overarching political statement (though it certainly points out problems with taking the fight to the mountains and villages of a country that has historically repelled outside invasions). Instead it focuses intently on four men devoted to carrying out a mission fully prepared to die to make it succeed. Yet Berg avoids jingoism. These are men doing their job one that is unfathomable for most of us. ""Lone Survivor"" is not a statement film then at least not one about the necessity of our presence in Afghanistan. Instead its about the resiliency and dedication of a few men which is a more effective inspiration anyway. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Peters) B- Lone Survivor Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Eric Bana Taylor Kitsch Mark Wahlberg; Director Peter Berg; Release Date Wide 01/10/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 121; MPAA Rating R Posted January 27 2014 -- 1200 AM EST Watching movies like Zero Dark Thirty and Captain Phillips you might get the impression that Navy SEALs are immune to failure. That theyre bulletproof superheroes clad in camo. But Peter Berg wants us to see a different side of heroism in Lone Survivor -- the side sometimes found in defeat. Based on Marcus Luttrells first-person account of an ill-fated 2005 SEAL operation in Afghanistan the unsparing film nobly attempts to mine triumph from tragedy by showing us how courage and character emerge even when things go disastrously wrong. Berg the actor-turned-director behind 2004s Friday Night Lights and 2007s The Kingdom has fast become a sort of specialist in macho cinema. But that style of storytelling is trickier to pull off than it seems. It needs to give us more than gung ho military jargon backslapping band-of-brothers camaraderie and crimson arias of violence. It requires nuance. And in Lone Survivor Berg never quite finds the right balance. It isnt clear what he wants to tell us besides ""War is hell."" On that point at least there can be no argument. The film opens with a real-life montage of the SEALs notoriously arduous training process. Berg who also wrote the screenplay lets that prologue do a lot of the heavy lifting for him in terms of character development. Right off the bat we know that these soldiers are low-paid patriots being put through the wringer to protect our freedom. Yes the SEALs in the film -- played with impressive grit and vulnerability by Mark Wahlberg (as Luttrell) Emile Hirsch Taylor Kitsch and especially Ben Foster -- tease each other about wives and girlfriends back home. Yet before any of that is allowed to sink in theyre being air-dropped into hostile territory. Their mission called Operation Red Wings deposits them deep into the inhospitable mountains of Kunar Province to capture or kill a senior Taliban commander responsible for murdering Marines. But the assignment is quickly compromised when theyre confronted by a family of Afghan shepherds who may or may not be affiliated with the enemy. Should they kill them or let them go? The choice isnt black-and-white. The rules of engagement say one thing their guts another. Tragically the right decision is the one that seals their fates. Soon theyre pinned down taking fire outmanned and outgunned. The action that follows is excruciating and relentless and Berg doesnt spare the audience. If anything he rubs our noses in the blood sweat and tears of combat. Bullets pierce bodies with sickening force and frequency bones shatter men die (the films title is its own spoiler). And while the SEALs fight bravely theres a sensation of excess to it all. Like the brutal 12 Years a Slave and The Passion of the Christ Lone Survivor makes us question just how much realism we need or want. Berg has made a powerful film and an important reminder of what really happens when we send men and women off to war. Its just too bad that subtlety isnt a stronger weapon in his arsenal.

"Lone Survivor | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lone-survivor ) Lone Survivor (United States 2013) January 07 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli In the mountains of Afghanistan one man injured and bleeding struggles against impossible odds to stay alive. Its at this point that the focus of Peter Bergs Lone Survivor shifts from that of a war movie to that of a tale of survival. In retrospect its something of a minor miracle that every member of the militarys Operation Red Wings didnt go home in a body bag. Its not that the mission was poorly planned although too much faith was placed in uncertain communication methods but it was undone by a freak and unfortunate coincidence. The result was a U.S. death toll of 19 for an action that was not initially viewed as being especially dangerous. Lone Survivor is director Peter Bergs ""reward"" for making Battleship for Universal Pictures. The studio agreed to bankroll Lone Survivor only if Berg first helmed what they hoped would launch a new summer movie franchise. (We all know how that turned out.) The film is based on events that occurred on the ground in the Hindu Kush mountains of the Kunar province in June 2005 as related in the book co-authored by sole survivor Marcus Luttrell. The movie starts out by introducing us to the four main characters all Navy SEALs who will end up involved in a firefight with vastly superior numbers. In addition to Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) were presented with mission leader Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt ""Axe"" Axelson (Ben Foster). Lieutenant Commander Erik Kristensen the overall commander of SEAL Team 10 is given a fair amount of screen time possibly due to his being played by Eric Bana. The meet-and-great section of Lone Survivor is standard stuff - isolated vignettes designed to humanize the men who will end up in harms way. Its effectiveness is limited; aside from Luttrell the characters seem generic. The objective of Operation Red Wings is the capture or elimination of a high-value Taliban leader. Four SEALs are placed on the ground to target him. The first problem they encounter is that neither their radio equipment nor their satellite phone works with regularity leaving them cut off when a key decision needs to be made. Then while theyre in hiding their position is approached by three goat herders. In what stands out as the films most compelling sequence the SEALs must make a life-and-death decision abide by the rules of engagement and release their unarmed prisoners or kill men they believe could be Taliban spies. In a move that has led to much soul-searching by Luttrell and second-guessing throughout the military the SEALs release the goat herders. Less than two hours later they are ambushed and three of them dont survive. Even worse a rescue helicopter is shot down greatly increasing the death toll. Bergs mix of traditional equipment and hand-held cameras proves effective in capturing the tension and chaos of the battle. The Americans suffer injuries not only because of the weapons of their attackers but because in their retreat they fall down steep slopes littered with rocks and other devastating debris. The films treatment of battle is realistic in a grim gruesome fashion. One extended sequence beginning when the SEALs first take fire and ending when Luttrell falls asleep while in hiding represents filmmaking at its most intense. Lone Survivor is graphic in its depiction of what happened to these men and is not for those who believe war movies should be sanitized. Some aspects of the production are similar to Robert Redfords Lions for Lambs (which may have in part been inspired by Operation Red Wings) but this is a more centered motion picture maintaining its narrative momentum with a brisk pace. The acting is solid but not of the type likely to attract awards considerations. Mark Walhberg is the films glue and hes believable as a man who despite taking an incredible amount of physical punishment continues to struggle along. None of the other actors is given sufficient time to develop a legitimate character. Eric Bana in particular is wasted although it has been reported that the actor after reading the script was willing to accept any role just to appear in the film. It can be said that Lone Survivor does justice to Luttrells story providing a cinematic recreation of events that were related in great detail in the book and which Luttrell discussed in countless 2007 interviews. Lone Survivor can be seen as either a nihilistic chronicle of a mission gone wrong in which nearly all of the characters are killed or a tale of courage and survival about how one man defied the odds and returned home. Most war films try to be epic in scope and intent. Lone Survivor opts for a smaller focus and succeeds on its own terms.

"Lone Survivor - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Lone Survivor Posted by Christy Lemire on January 5 2014 11 Comments Universal Studios Rated R for strong bloody war violence and pervasive language. Running time 121 minutes. Three stars out of four. We had a lively debate on What the Flick? recently about ""Lone Survivor"" and whether its intended as a propaganda film or an anti-war statement. Ben Alonso and I had different reactions at different points throughout writer-director Peter Bergs movie which depicts a botched 2005 mission to take out a Taliban leader in Afghanistan. Bergs film based on the memoir of the same name by former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell is both beautifully shot and brutal to watch. It features men of great skill dedication and heroism staying true to each other and their goal despite some horrifically messy circumstances including faulty technology and disastrous miscommunication. Once it was over I walked out of ""Lone Survivor"" feeling that Berg pulled off a tricky balancing act He crafted a movie that simultaneously inspires admiration and frustration. Ultimately yes it does seem to be making an anti-war statement Here are elite fighters who have given their all in the service of absolutely nothing. But Bergs opening title sequence actually feels like a recruiting video with footage of real-life SEALs undergoing grueling training exercises to test their bodies and minds and forge their bond as a unit. He goes on to introduce us to Luttrell (a smart-ass no-nonsense Mark Wahlberg) and the rest of the men on his team. They include special-ops leader Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) Matt Axelson (Ben Foster) and Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch). A brilliant sunrise in a vast sky begins their day in striking fashion as if to suggest that anything is possible. (Tobias Schliessler who also shot Bergs ""Battleship"" and ""Friday Night Lights"" provides the gorgeous cinematography.) Images like this might suggest to the audience that this is a film thats selling a lifestyle; harrowing sequences later on tell a very different story. Berg efficiently and effectively establishes the vibe of good-natured banter and ball-busting that permeates the air base. Mike and Danny routinely compete in early-morning foot races. Danny ponders the kitchen tile choices his wife back home has presented him. Mikes fiancee wants an Arabian horse as a wedding gift. Such details make these men feel real and the well-cast actors effortless chemistry early on makes their teamwork under duress seem that much more believable. You absolutely feel like these guys would do anything for each other. Eric Bana as their cool all-business commander assigns the foursome a mission Drop in by helicopter in the middle of the night then wait all day and the following night in the craggy merciless mountains above a remote Afghan village. There they will seek a Taliban leader (Yousuf Azami) and his second-in-command whom they have permission to neutralize. Highly trained as they are the SEALs seem confident about the task at hand even as they acknowledge that it has ""a lot of moving parts."" But as they tuck themselves into the woods to lie in wait a trio of shepherds and their goats stumbles across them and immediately alters their intricate plan. The ensuing debate over what to do with them is both thoughtful and suspenseful as these four men weigh the various options and their tactical and ethical consequences. The time for talk ends quickly though as the SEALs find themselves surrounded and under siege by well-armed Taliban members. (The depiction of the Afghan people in ""Lone Survivor"" is a little superficial and one of the films few weaknesses. Theyre either singularly evil or impossibly altruistic.) But the ensuing battle -- one long punishing firefight -- is a marvel of intimate precise filmmaking. Berg puts us right in the middle of the action and his use of sound design is superb. We hear and feel every piercing bullet every crunch of bone. The SEALs tumble down steep rocky embankments their repeatedly bodies hitting trees and boulders with loud hard thumps and thwacks. (Berg probably could have done with less shaky-cam though -- the chaos is clear enough.) Bloodied and battered they keep getting up to fight -- and to protect each other -- until they can get up no longer. We know from the title that there will be only one survivor yet that doesnt make the loss of his brethren any less painful to watch. Weve come to admire and appreciate these men as Berg obviously does even as we question the necessity of the mission that claimed their lives. The fact that we know the outcome doesnt deplete the film of its tension -or its emotion. Actually it will probably leave you feeling more riled-up than before no matter how you choose to interpret its message.

Maybe its hard for most civilians to understand but we do it because it has to be done...simple as that. Most people dont hear of the failed ops simply because the news doesnt talk about it. No one is perfect and that includes special forces. The Taliban are a horrible lot and there is no other way they understand. We are infidels and must be eliminated at all costs...being nice to them only makes them think we are weak. It really is black and white. Just the opinion of a 20 year Navy veteran. Reply January 6 2014  by  Paul     The best war movies are basically survival stories - focusing on people caught up in an impossible situation and trying to make it out in one piece. This one sounds like a quintessential survival story. Reply January 6 2014  by  barrbo     Has this reviewer read anything about Lattrell? NO You think it is an anti war book? Movie? How many years were you in the service? You nothing Reply January 14 2014  by  Joe     So unless you were in the service you are not allowed to have an opinion about this movie or what its themes might be? Thats like saying you cant talk about The Hobbit unless youre a dwarf. Its a movie. Reply January 9 2014  by  mike     What a worthless review by a liberal hippie. The movie is not about making a statement. Its just a movie designed to entertain and make money. Get over yourself Lemire. Reply January 9 2014  by  Christian Toto     It frustrates me to see the ""recruitment video"" line in nearly every review that depicts the U.S. Military in a remotely positive light. The opening segments show the dedication required to be a SEAL. It hardly looks glorious. Its brutal frankly but for those who want to push themselves to the limit it could be appealing. Thats a recruitment video? Try ""Top Gun."" Reply January 9 2014  by  Christy Lemire     Thanks for sharing your thoughts everyone. Christian I do think the beginning makes being a part of this sort of elite fighting squad look appealing -- brutal yes but also a noble challenge worth aspiring toward and a source of pride for those tough enough to make it. Reply January 10 2014  by  S.M. Stirling     ""whether its intended as a propaganda film or an anti-war statement."" -- and an anti-war statement would -not- be propaganda... why exactly? ""Here are elite fighters who have given their all in the service of absolutely nothing."" -- Thats most assuredly not what the participants would have said. Have you ever met any front-line types? As one of them said to me ""Were not dupes or victims. We knew what we were getting into. We do this because we like doing it; if we didnt wed find another way of making a living."" There are words to that effect in the book and the movie. You really need to stretch a little and get inside the head of people who do -not- think like you or experience the world the same way. Reply January 11 2014  by  Tom     Great review enjoyed the write up. Except for one part ""... given their all in the service of absolutely nothing."" That you could write that just shows sorry to say that you truly just dont ""get it."" Reply January 20 2014  by  Fitzy     I think the bottom line is that this movie doesnt really make war look like fun. At all. I would not want to be in a war after watching this. It does not make me want to go fight a war. Reply February 8 2014  by  Lex     The lefty critics jumped all over Act of Valor too in an obvious attempt to demonize the military. Powerful movies of these types scare the libs to death since theyre afraid anything showing the military and elite spec ops warriors in a positive light will expose their bias against the military. They say these movies smack of ""jingoism"" which they love to toss out on an effort to deflect. As for the argument its just a recruitment movie its apparent they never read the book since Marcus went to great lengths to illustrate the dedication it takes to make it through BUDS. Peter Burg did a splendid job of incorporating that critical part of the book into the movie by utilizing actual footage to enlighten viewers of that part of becoming a SEAL team member.

"Lone Survivor reviewed Peter Bergs war movie starring Mark Wahlberg is jingoistic cliched and harrowing. Slate Sign In Sign Up Lone Survivors Title Gives Away the Ending But That Doesnt Make It Any Less Harrowing Lone Survivors Title Gives Away the Ending But That Doesnt Make It Any Less Harrowing Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 2 2014 732 PM Lone Survivor A down-and-dirty exercise in vicarious battle trauma. By Dana Stevens Emile Hirsch in Lone Survivor. Courtesy Universal Pictures The title of Lone Survivor Peter Bergs recounting of the experiences of Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell in Afghanistan in 2005 (adapted by Berg from a best-selling memoir by Luttrell and Patrick Robinson) gives away the game right up front. Of the four young SEALs we get to know in the course of this tense chronicle of a mission gone wrong only one will make it to the last frame alive--and given the prominence of Mark Wahlbergs bruised wary face on the poster we have a pretty good guess which one. But Lone Survivors lack of suspense never works against it. If anything the fact that the outcome is at least roughly known in advance only adds to the films sickening tension the atmosphere of preordained doom through which its characters seem to move. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. At times the writer-directors respect for the SEALs who charge into this doom leads him into a tone thats at once jingoistic and cliched The opening montage of real-life Navy SEALs in training isnt above silhouetting its self-proclaimed ""band of brothers"" against the rising sun recruitment ad-style. And yet its clear that Berg is no apologist for the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan. During the movies hard-to-watch middle section at the height of the daylong Taliban shootout it depicts with such stark realism Lone Survivor is almost an antiwar film It evokes the confusion panic and raw fear of battle with such vividness you want to run out of the theater. Ultimately Berg seems less concerned with this war in particular than he is with the experience of fighting in any war. Theres little in the way of political or historical context and virtually no ideological bluster. Lone Survivor is a down-and-dirty exercise in vicarious battle trauma. The film even begins with a kind of warning to the viewer in the form of a voice-over from the just-rescued Luttrell (Wahlberg) whos given first aid in a helicopter as we hear his thoughts about what drives some men to serve in the worlds most dangerous and frightening places. ""We wanted that fight at the highest volume"" says Luttrell as defibrillator paddles are applied to his heavily lacerated chest. ""The loudest darkest coldest most unpleasant of the unpleasant fights."" As hes proved in Friday Night Lights and The Kingdom (in the spirit of New Years forgiveness let us not speak of Battleship) Bergs specialty is showing groups of young men in extreme duress. Advertisement Things will get plenty unpleasant soon enough but in the interim theres a flashback to a comparatively peaceful morning a few days earlier as the four men who will become the films focus are waking up in their plywood cubicles at Bagram Air Base the morning before Operation Red Wings begins. Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) is the special-ops team leader a taciturn modest man so respected by his men hes become the stuff of camp legend. His team includes communications specialist Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson (Ben Foster) Gunners Mate Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Luttrell the medic. Theyre dispatched via helicopter to a steep rocky hillside near a remote village while their commander Erik Kristensen (Eric Bana) monitors the action from base camp eventually intervening in a rescue attempt. The purpose of the mission to locate and execute an important Taliban target Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami.) As Mike observes dryly on hearing his higher-ups description of the plan this seemingly straightforward mission has ""a lot of moving parts""--including the presence of many Afghans near the village who have nothing to do with the Taliban. When the SEALs cross paths with an old man and a young boy herding goats they hold them prisoner for a while debating whether to let them go leave them tied to a tree or--in the chilling wording of the increasingly gung-ho Axe--""terminate the complication."" Its the closest the film comes to a consideration of the ethics of war though its noteworthy that even Luttrells plea to free the unarmed villagers is motivated as much by pragmatism as by altruism ""CNN OK? SEALs kill kids. Thats the fuckin story forever."" As hes proved in Friday Night Lights and The Kingdom (in the spirit of New Years forgiveness let us not speak of Battleship) Bergs specialty is showing groups of young men in extreme duress tested to the limits of their physical endurance and courage. At times he also tests the endurance of the audience. In one scene the fall of the entire team down a steep rocky cliff is shown in gruesome detail one bone-breaking thwack at a time. Just minutes later they fall down another cliff and we witness it all again. And if someone receives medical attention in this movie you can be sure every moment of DIY wound stitching or shrapnel removal will be fully documented in close-up with strict adherence to the autopsy reports. Berg tested his own limits and those of his cast too. Together they underwent a version of Navy SEAL training in preparation for the shoot and their dedication to documenting the physical and emotional rigors of battle--and the intensity and intimacy of the bonds among SEALs--is complete. Though a few of the characters could have been better fleshed out in the script every performance is committed understated and superb. Even if we know from the missions outset that three of these four courageous (yet terrified) young men are doomed to die when the time comes its wrenching to lose each one. There are in essence no women in Lone Survivor (a photo of Axes fiancee taped to a computer stands in for the wives and girlfriends the men have left behind at home) and the Afghans we encounter come in only two moral flavors the ruthless Taliban warlord and his cohort or the generous self-sacrificing villager (Ali Suliman) who with the help of his saucer-eyed young son offers Luttrell food and a place to hide from the Taliban. But despite Bergs narrow focus on the macho crucible of warfare Lone Survivor doesnt strike me as what one unimpressed critic has called ""a jingoistic snuff film."" Even if its SEALs are sometimes lensed in golden hues its hard to imagine sitting through its onslaught of physical and moral violence--including an exchange in which one dying SEAL expresses his regret that ""we didnt kill more of these motherfuckers""--without being sickened by the waste carnage and spiritual degradation of war.

Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Lone Survivor Director Peter Berg Genre Drama Running Time 121 minutes Rated R for strong bloody war violence and pervasive language With Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Emile Hirsch Ben Foster We are awash in war films and why is it that nonfiction films such as Dirty Wars or Iraq in Fragments increasingly resort to the dramatizing techniques of narrative film while fiction films strain toward procedure as if to avoid the sticky business of interpretation altogether? For the better part of its first hour Lone Survivor -- a fact-based procedural about four Navy SEALS dispatched to document the activities of a high-ranking Taliban operative in Afghanistan -- rehearses preparation in obsessive detail. Sure there are the familiar faces youd expect from a men-at-war action picture Mark Wahlberg Ben Foster Taylor Kitsch Eric Bana as well as one (Emile Hirsch) you might not. A back story is sketched in here and there to heighten the pathos of what follows. No spoilers necessary; the grisly outcome if not the finale is all in the movies title and its opening sequence. But mostly its ripped male muscle being put through its excruciating paces by yelling drill sergeants meticulous planning at Bagram Air Base the loading of high-tech gear the whir of choppers -- all the busy stuff of a brutally efficient Peter Berg movie. Until that is everything goes quiet the four are on their own and the Watershed Moment arrives. On a steep mountainside the SEALS are confronted with a family of shepherds one of whom -- a handsome boy -- stares at the Americans with hatred in his eyes. The inscrutable patriarch carries a walkie-talkie. Are they for or against the Taliban? Do the rules of engagement apply or the rules of survival? The panicked debate that follows about whether to kill the shepherds or let them go is an unnerving stew of ethics protocol and naked calculation. But whats great is that no Ethical Angel appears nor any correct answer. Theres only someone whos willing to break the stalemate and make a choice. Whatever the SEALS do will have fateful consequences and from here on the outcomes are all in the meticulous detail. In the contrast between the lightning speed with which the Afghan boy leaps down the craggy mountain like one of his goats and the Americans slow huffing ascent as they try to call the whole thing off and discover that a communications glitch has cut them off from HQ we see the debacle to come. When you dont know the terrain and you dont know whos for or against you heroics are either beside the point or they extend only as far as survival and solidarity. In this regard Berg is relentlessly unsparing -- in Lone Survivor we discover what it is like to topple downhill from rock to rock and what it is like to reach for your gun and find that your hand is missing -- but never Tarantino-sadistic. Theres courage aplenty in Lone Survivor -- the day when grunts were made to stand in for American imperialism is long gone and rightly so. But the movie is resolutely anti-heroic until the very end when triumphalism creeps in bringing a tattered happy ending belied by photos of the real-life casualties. Even then the lone survivor confronted with possible rescue and a little boy with huge dark eyes screams his intention to blow his saviors away. Is that his training or has he been pushed to a place where the rules of engagement no longer apply?

(Photo/Video Paramount Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated Dec. 24 2013 142 p.m. ET More Markets How Investigators Untangled the Wolf Scandal In ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort the celebrated crook of the 1990s who prided himself on his ability to sell anything and did in fact swindle investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars. Martin Scorseses epic-scale comedy of criminality adapted by Terence Winter from Mr. Belforts book of the same name is selling three hours of incessant shouting and sensationally bad behavior--mud wrestling without the mud that includes drugs booze debauchery degeneracy and dwarf-throwing. Its meant to be an entertaining even meaningful representation of the penny-stock maestros life and times. But I couldnt buy it and couldnt wait for the hollow spectacle to end. Thats no knock on Mr. DiCaprio who throws himself heart and soul into a character with deep deficits in both departments. Lets stipulate that his extravagant embodiment of excess is extremely skillful and very funny and put other stipulations on record as well. Jonah Hill equipped with phosphorescent teeth and a manic affect is often hilarious as Jordans partner in the sleazy firm of Stratton Oakmont. So is Matthew McConaughey in a madcap soliloquy on masturbation and the need to stay relaxed. The film does full justice to its denizens devotion to cocaine Quaaludes and heroin and to morphine which Jordan takes ""because its awesome."" The Scorsese touch is everywhere in evidence swirling set pieces (Stratton Oakmonts boiler room full of rabid brokers as a Roman bacchanal) spectacular camera moves (Rodrigo Prieto was the cinematographer) and all of it heightened and sharpened by Thelma Schoonmakers editing. Some of the settings are enjoyable up to a point for their tacky sumptuousness I liked the trashing of a Lamborghini Countach. And sharp-witted scenes do play out from time to time on a human scale. In one of them a couple of FBI agents engage the wily Jordan in a game of cat-and-rat. ENLARGE Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort. Paramount Pictures Eventually though the pandemonium wears you down; in my case eventually meant the end of the first hour with two more hours to go. ""Stratton Oakmont is America"" insists Jordan ever the overreacher in the course of his self-serving valedictory. Maybe so but any meaningful perspective on the greedfest of the period is obscured by the gleefulness of the depiction. The film may well prove profitable Lurid outlaws are always appealing and theres pleasure to be had in the downfall of slimeballs. But ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" demands a huge investment of time for a paltry return. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Sometimes you see failed films and think well they tried for this or that but couldnt pull it off. After seeing Ben Stillers version of the venerable James Thurber story I dont know what the film was trying for. Its a cipher in every realm but the visual. (Stuart Dryburgh did the stylish cinematography.) ENLARGE Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) imagines himself as a fearless mountain climber who captures the attention of his co-worker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig). 20th Century Fox Mr. Stiller isnt the first one of course to play Walter Mitty on screen. In 1947 eight years after the Thurber story appeared in The New Yorker magazine an elaborate MGM production starred Danny Kaye as the wistful daydreamer who imagines himself in heroic situations. The movie was overblown with a succession of preposterous adventures that grew tedious; its durable reputation is due to its star a great comic actor who did memorably well with Walters mood swings between mousy and manic. Mr. Stillers version written by Steve Conrad wisely moderates the derring-do but unwisely sends its hero on a quest that swings tentatively between the spiritual and the absurd. Even the starting point feels tentative. The time is the present but Walter works in the photo department of Life magazine which closed down as a standalone publication more than a decade ago. (He goes forth in search of a missing negative shot by a legendary photographer.) Walter does have outlandish adventures in the Himalayas Greenland and Iceland but the lines between his fantasies and reality keep getting blurred. You dont know for instance if hes imagining himself jumping from a chopper into arctic waters or really making the jump. Whether the blurring is intentional or accidental it vitiates a film that already feels dissociated as if the basic narrative structure hadnt been thought through. Impressive landscapes plus Kristen Wiigs appealing Cheryl the fellow worker who inflames Walters passion make the movie enjoyable enough. Yet its style is a constant bafflement and nowhere more so than in a key scene on a Himalayan mountaintop--an encounter between Walter and a character played by Sean Penn. One could imagine the scene being played relatively straight as a moment of fleeting profundity in a comedy or as the culmination of a shaggy-dog story. Whats so baffling is the way it has been played--drained of energy tone or discernible attitude. Like so much of this journey by a shy guy from Life magazine Walters peak experience is weirdly lifeless. August Osage County Family dysfunction has seldom been as flamboyant--or notable for its performances and flow of language--as it is in this screen version of the Tracy Letts play directed by John Wells from a screenplay by the playwright. The cast alone is worth the price of admission Meryl Streep as the cancer-riddled drug-addled matriarch Violet Weston; Sam Shepard as her alcoholic husband; Julia Roberts Julianne Nicholson and Juliette Lewis as the couples daughters; and Chris Cooper Ewan McGregor Margo Martindale Benedict Cumberbatch and Abigail Breslin as members of their extended family. The language rich in invective flows from kindred spirits who are rich in aggressiveness both the active and passive flavors. By comparison to this familial Grand Guignol ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is a crash course in decorousness. Watch the trailer for ""August Osage County"" a new film based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Tracy Letts. Starring Meryl Streep Julia Roberts Ewan McGregor and more. When I saw the play on Broadway some years ago I had a good seat down front on the left yet awkward staging prevented me from seeing Violet at the family table at the peak of her rage. Estelle Parsons was formidable in the role but one of Vis daughters had plunked herself down between her mother and me. The movie provides perfect sight lines meaning a chance to see Ms. Streep do all of her stuff at every moment and she is marvelous. (So what else is new about her work?) In addition to raging Vi wheedles needles seduces and charms and her mental fogs disperse miraculously whenever she finds a chance to lacerate one of her loved ones with something mean. ENLARGE Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. Weinstein Co. The movie also gives us a chance to see Ms. Roberts in action and shes marvelous too in an austere style that perfectly complements Ms. Streeps volcanism. Her Barbara has the dubious gifts of clarity and self-irony. She sees her mother and her family for the tortured people they are but shes still her mothers daughter. In a dark determinist comedy about the transmission of rage from one generation to the next this seemingly vital woman is incurably infected. The Invisible Woman Ralph Fienness elegantly crafted agreeably leisurely period drama does a public service by making the woman of the title visible. Born Ellen Ternan into a family of actors she was often called Nelly and as an 18-year-old became the very young and secret lover of Charles Dickens who was more than twice her age. The service lies partly in bringing Nelly out of obscurity--her story is one of a steep price paid for the passionate attention of a literary giant who may have had no love to give anyone but the characters in his books. It also lies in casting Felicity Jones who is as eloquent and beautifully modulated in the role as she is physically beautiful. Still Dickens dominates the story; hes a fiery presence as played by Mr. Fiennes who directed from Abi Morgans adaptation of a book by Claire Tomalin. ENLARGE Ralph Fiennes as Charles Dickens and Felicity Jones as Nelly Ternan Sony Pictures Classics This immeasurably famous writer and amateur actor doesnt mean to enslave Nelly to him. Still hes at the height of his career and engulfed by writing amateur acting and a gift for giving spellbinding readings. Its tempting to call him a 19th-century London version of a rock star but Dickens was far more accessible than that Londoners knew him flocked to him and drew pleasure from his proximity. Nelly draws pleasure too. Shes inexorably attracted to him even after she comes to understand that their relationship will remain secret. The film overemphasizes Dickenss emotional repression; in fact he was devastated by a terrible accident that in the film leaves him relatively cold and mainly concerned about preserving the secrecy of Nellys status. But ""The Invisible Woman"" gives us a plausible image of the great man in the fullness of his celebrity and an affecting portrait of the woman who lived much of her life in his shadow. Lone Survivor Peter Bergs screen version of Marcus Luttrells book is remarkably good at dramatizing the notorious 2005 Navy SEAL operation that went horrifically bad. The power of this production isnt evident in the preface a standard-brand account of the rigors of SEAL training. And familiar themes of combat movies make up most of the operations initial phase--cocky banter macho preening talk of wives and girlfriends back home. The first hint of whats to come is someones casually ominous observation about the complexity of the joint military planning ""A lot of moving parts."" ENLARGE ""Lone Survivor"" the story of four Navy SEALs on a covert mission to neutralize a high-level Taliban operative. Universal Pictures The parts were set in motion for Operation Red Wings a covert mission intended to kill or capture a Taliban commander in northern Afghanistan. A four-man team of SEALs was ambushed by Taliban fighters and the books author then the team medic was the lone survivor of a debacle that also took the lives of 16 men aboard a rescue helicopter shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade. Mr. Luttrell now retired is played by Mark Wahlberg; the other team members are played by Taylor Kitsch Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster. All four performances are first-rate and the action is staged with shattering intensity. Literally and graphically shattering. The film is a celebration of courage and the brotherhood of warriors facing unfathomable danger in the service of their country. These too are familiar themes but they take on new meaning in ""Lone Survivor."" The SEALs arent just shot at in a merciless firefight. They are shot time and again. They are almost aerated by Taliban bullets and they fight on. Their training has turned them into fighting machines and their equipment employs technologies undreamed of in earlier wars. Yet their high-tech edge is blunted by faulty communications their support is compromised by limited resources--the film doesnt try to score political points on this score but questions are implicit in the narrative--and their flesh and blood are anguishingly vulnerable when all the planning comes unraveled. A lot of moving parts in a moving film. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Mean Streets (1973) This is the wellspring of Martin Scorseses career. Every potent element of his art flowed from it the violence the sense of evil the tribal warfare the fascination with criminality and the explosive style. Its a small-scale film with enormous impact even now four decades after it hit the screen. The setting is Little Italy where Mr. Scorsese grew up and the cast includes the stunningly young Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel. The script was written by Mardik Martin and the director who also played a gunman in a car. Greenberg (2010) ENLARGE Ben Stiller was uncompromisingly brilliant though widely unpopular in Noah Baumbachs comedy which scintillates with intelligence razors-edge humor and austere empathy for its struggling lovers. Mr. Stiller is Roger Greenberg a middle-aging misanthrope whose anger is matched only by his narcissism. Greta Gerwig gives a performance of heartbreaking delicacy as Florence Marr a wistful young woman falling into a love affair with him. ""Ive gotta stop doing things just because they feel good"" Florence says but theres no evidence she feels truly good about anything. Coriolanus (2011) ENLARGE In choosing one of Shakespeares more opaque plays for his directorial debut Ralph Fiennes emulated the character he portrays a refractory Roman general Caius Martius Coriolanus for whom compromise equals surrender. But the general comes to a bad end while Mr. Fiennes achieved a great beginning as a director and his performance stands as a chilling exemplar of psychomartial ferocity. The cast includes Jessica Chastain as the heros ardent wife Virgilia; Gerard Butler as Tullus Aufidius his mortal enemy; and Vanessa Redgrave as his mother Volumnia alongside whom todays tiger moms seem toothless. 129 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Review Peter Bergs fierce Lone Survivor captures realities of war - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Peter Bergs fierce Lone Survivor captures realities of war ""Lone Survivor"" Gregory Peters / Universal Pictures Mark Wahlberg right stars in ""Lone Survivor."" Mark Wahlberg right stars in ""Lone Survivor."" (Gregory Peters / Universal Pictures) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic In ""Lone Survivor"" filmmaker Peter Berg has finally found the right war to fight and the right cast to fight it. Based on Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrells memoir of a failed military operation in Afghanistan the action is led by Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Emile Hirsch Ben Foster and Eric Bana.Whether it will be your kind of war depends. ""Lone Survivor"" is as much a paean to machismo as to the ultimate sacrifice of troops in the line of fire. That kind of unfiltered and excessive test of body mind and spirit is characteristic of the muscular moviemaking Berg favors. Though it hasnt always worked for the director (last years ""Battleship"" for example) it did on the football field in his 2004 breakthrough ""Friday Night Lights."" The attitude works better still in the Afghan mountains where the combat is fierce and at ground level. Berg who wrote and directed is more interested in how men deal with battle than the ideals or the politics that put them there. What the movie achieves with a gruesome energy and a remarkable reality is a firefight. Bullets ripping through bodies; harrowing falls snapping bones; blinding pain; men soldiering on despite wounds that should stop them. Captured in uncompromising detail by director of photography Tobias Schliessler this movie is not for the faint of heart.PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Betsy Sharkey Luttrell and Patrick Robinsons bestselling book zeros in on 2005s Operation Red Wings. The plan was to put an elite special ops team close enough to a Taliban stronghold to take out a key rebel leader. Instead it devolved into one of the wars costliest single missions in human terms. Between the men on the ground and the team helicoptered in to try to extricate them 19 troops were lost. One survived.Though the title would suggest this is the survivors story the film is very much about the collective and individual actions of five men. The team that heads into the remote Afghan mountains include sonar technician Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson (Foster) gunners mate Danny Dietz (Hirsch) medic Luttrell (Wahlberg) and leader Michael Murphy (Kitsch). Heading the operation back at base camp and the rescue efforts that will follow is Lt. Cmdr. Erik Kristensen (Bana).Dont judge the film by the first scenes. The visual montage of the extremes of SEALS training is unnecessary and heavy-handed.PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Kenneth Turan The movie actually begins a few minutes in with Luttrell knocking on deaths door. That scene accomplishes what the first fails to do -- in a dramatic heartbeat of images and narration it completely captures the spirit of ""Lone Survivors"" fighting force.The story shifts back a few days and unfolds in two distinct parts -- the mission then the survival. The first stop is Bagram air base Afghanistan. Inside the makeshift quarters where the special ops team awaits its next assignment there is a locker room vibe where teasing looks a lot like hazing. A sense of lives back home is in the photos of girlfriends wives and kids taped above beds in email exchanges. But fundamentally this is a mans world a testosterone-saturated proving ground.The switch flips to serious once the mission is underway. Shot on location in New Mexico the sheer rock walls of the Santa Cristo range stand in for Afghanistan putting the difficulty and the danger in sharp relief. The terrain is significant providing some of the films most dramatic action.PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013Though many already know the story Berg is good at tension building as the team sets up in the hills above the village where the target Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami) is thought to be hiding. An encounter with three goat herders sets disaster in motion. The Taliban is alerted and the SEALs are soon under attack. When all seems lost the action shifts to a Pashtun village a defiant local named Gulab (Ali Suliman) and his young son who come to Luttrells aid. This is the film at its most hopeful.But ""Lone Survivor"" is short on hope. The fight scenes are extensive and exist almost as a separate character shaped by adrenaline determination and fear. Even when a more workmanlike phase of the battle sets in and one scenario after another is either discarded or attempted the sense of duress never fades.The production and costume designers have paid a great deal of attention to the details from the uniforms and tribal robes to the bullet wounds and blood. It certainly adds to the films verisimilitude. But what makes ""Lone Survivor"" work as well as it does are the human exchanges. Whether friend or foe the moments feels all too real.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TVWahlberg is garnering much well-deserved attention for his gritty portrayal of Luttrell. That the other fighters become distinctive characters whose fate is just as critical to the film is a credit to Foster Hirsch and Kitsch. As visceral as all four make the pain it is the raw emotions that are so riveting. Pain in their eyes tension rippling across faces acceptance of the inevitable but never retreat. Berg has said he felt pressure to properly honor the lives of the real men of Red Wings and the weight of that responsibility can be felt in every frame. When a sort of cinematic jingoism threatens the nuances of the performances help pull things back. And the roll call of the fallen at the end feels exactly right.--- Lone SurvivorMPAA rating R for strong bloody war violence and pervasive language.Running time 2 hours 1 minutePlaying At ArcLight Hollywoodbetsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Human Interest Unrest Conflicts and War Afghanistan Mark Wahlberg Reviews Kenneth Turans best feature films of 2013 Review Scorsese DiCaprio go hunting in Wolf of Wall Street Review August Osage County dysfunction doesnt play on film stage Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-lone-survivor-review-20131225,0,6791422.story#axzz2ob03fVID",200,lonesurvivor27,lonesurvivor,latimes

Dec. 25 2013 Lieut. Commander Erik Kristensen (Eric Bana) has run his Navy SEAL Team 10 through the torture of training which they somehow survive and tells them ""You just proved to your bodies through your mind that you can push yourself further than you thought possible."" Yes very impressive the physical endurance of young men dedicated to a military mission. But pushed them where? And to what purpose? Maybe from a patriotic impulse but mainly as Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) says because these young men felt most alive when they were ""pushing ourselves into those cold dark corners where the bad things live where the bad things fight. We wanted that fight at the highest volume."" Writer-director Peter Bergs Lone Survivor based on Luttrells best-selling nonfiction book shows war at high volume and variable octane. It details Operation Red Wings a March 2005 mission into Afghanistan to take out the Taliban leader Ahmad Shahd. The films title like those of 12 Years a Slave and Robert Bressons A Man Escaped (known in France as A Man Condemned to Death Escapes) reveals the climax of the story before it begins. Once the quartet of SEALs lands on a mountain overlooking the village the village that is Shahds operating base and the fierce skirmish begins you know that only Marcus will survive. Its his memoir. (MORE Peter Berg on filming Lone Survivor) This is a movie in three acts with three competing agendas. It creates macho-men stereotypes to earn sympathy for men occupying a country most of whose inhabitants dont want them. It then explodes the fantasy of an all-potent U.S. military through the muddle and screwups that can plague any large operation. Finally it embraces another convention of war movies civilians so grateful for the intervention of an American soldier that they give him refuge and the means of escape. You are welcome to accept any of these propositions but its hard to buy all three. At the start the SEAL contingent is ""a band of brothers"" whose readiness for heroism is proved by undergoing the intense strength training that action-film stars do. Wonderful guys and the vast majority of them white no ""Brooklyn"" a token Italian or Jew as found in World War II movie regiments no blacks bantering with whites as in Vietnam films like Platoon. Some strut their bravado -- ""I am the reaper"" shouts Axe Axelson (Ben Foster) -- when not Skyping their loving wives back home. Both gestures in war movies if not in real life are sure indicators of imminent violent death. (MORE Corlisss cover story on Oliver Stones Platoon) The four men -- Marcus Axe Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) -- have a presentiment of this missions peril ""Lot of moving parts"" Murphy observes. On the hill they quickly get Shahd code-named Rick James in their gunsights but dont pull the triggers; this is to be only a reconnaissance op. When they capture an old man and two boys who may or may not be Taliban fighters the SEALs must choose one of three options kill them bind them as captives or let them go. Marcus argues against the first choice imagining the worlds horrified response ""CNN O.K.? SEALs Kill Kids. Thats the f--in story forever."" The one thing they cant do is interrogate the trio; the team has been trained in everything but elementary Pashto. Once their captives are let loose and they scamper down to alert the Taliban the real fighting begins. Smartly captured by cinematographer Tobias Schliessler and orchestrated by editor Colby Parker Jr. -- both of whom worked for Berg on Friday Night Lights Hancock and Battleship -- the 31-minute sequence lends verismo and fatalism to the many things that can go wrong in the waging of war frayed communications with the home base the unavailability of air support the refusal of the top brass to order a quick adjustment of the mission. All that plus hundreds of Taliban attacking four trapped Americans and not one of them Katniss Everdeen. Its a vivid you-are-there massacre. (MORE Mary Pols review of Peter Bergs Battleship) When the grievously wounded Marcus makes it down the hill and into the village Lone Survivor devolves into a dewy idyll. Marcus removes one of the bullets hes taken by performing DIY triage; and a winsome local boy and his dad help Marcus fulfill his mission. ""F-- the Taliban"" one villager shouts in English as if providing expert testimony in the court of skeptical world opinion Yes this is why we are in Afghanistan. That these events actually happened doesnt necessarily make it plausible or powerful in a movie or keep it from seeming like convenient propaganda. The 49-year-old director and his main cast underwent rudimentary SEAL training pushing themselves ""further than you thought possible ... into those cold dark corners where the bad things live."" They carry some of that dedication into the film particularly in the harrowing middle-act siege. You may salute Lone Survivor for its desperate intensity; but the film remains pinned down by its military and political dilemma between gung ho and F-- no. An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the film editor. He is Colby Parker Jr. not Corey.

Lone Survivor the latest by Battleship director Peter Berg is a jingoistic snuff film about a Navy SEAL squadron outgunned by the Taliban in the mountainous Kunar province. After four soldiers -- played with muscles and machismo by Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster -- get IDd by Afghan goat herders theyre in a race to climb to the top of the nearest summit and summon an airlift before these civilians can sprint to the nearest village and alert local leader Ahmad Shah. It doesnt go well. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Bergs flick bleeds blood red bone-fracture white and bruise blue. Its based on the memoir Lone Survivor The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10 by sole evacuee Marcus Luttrell (played by Wahlberg) -- and thats only a spoiler if youve ignored the title. Luttrell didnt exactly write his book. Rather than sitting in front of a word processor he was back in action in Iraq. Instead the United States Navy hired British novelist Patrick Robinson who among other embellishments upped the number of enemy Taliban fighters from 10 to 200. Hey whatever man. Those aliens in Battleship werent real either.Lone Survivors problems are more complex than its Rambo-esque exuberance for machine-gun fire. The near-wordless second half is a deadly dubstep of bullets and snare drums punctuated with the occasional curse. Heres 90 seconds of dialogue transcribed in its entirety ""Goddamn this sucks"" ""Fuck you"" ""Fuck"" ""Damn fucking burns"" This doesnt help advance the plot which can pretty much be summed up as Dont die. And the film actually gets worse when the guys open their mouths.Film Details Lone Survivor RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time121 min. More Info These four men were heroes. But these heroes were also men. As the film portrays them their attitudes to the incredibly complex War on Terror fought hillside by bloody hillside in the Afghan frontier with both U.S. and Taliban forces contributing to an unconscionably high civilian body count were simple Brown people bad American people good. When the guys debate whether to kill the three goat herders whove stumbled onto their hiding place -- a dilemma that morality aside could have been solved if any of them had recalled that middle school logic problem about the fox the chicken the feed and the too-small boat -- Foster grabs an unarmed teenager by the face and insists ""Thats death. Look at death."" And when the firefight starts he bellows ""You can die for your country -- Im going to live for mine.""Related StoriesDrugs Diamonds International Intrigue -- You Wont Believe Two Hollywood Producers Crazy BackstoryAmerican Sniper Is a Rah-Rah War-on-Terror FantasyWere meant to cheer not that anyone in my theater did. But there will be audiences who do and Im not entirely sure Im comfortable with what theyre cheering for. This is death. Look at death.Berg is no dummy. Hes done the right thing by refusing to whitewash these guys as saints although three of the four are depicted as devoted husbands and fiancees and the fourth gets to be Mark Wahlberg. And Berg is justified in hoisting these guys up as real-life action stars building his case with an opening montage of actual Navy SEAL training footage in which screaming instructors winnow a pack of athletes into an all-for-one-one-for-all band of badass brothers who when forced to float in freezing ocean waves link arms and sing ""Silent Night.""They were ready for action. ""We wanted that fight at the highest volume"" Wahlberg says ""the loudest coldest darkest most unpleasant of the unpleasant fights."" OK but did the local villagers whom we see get caught in the crossfire want that fight? Each like Wahlbergs Luttrell had families and friends and a full life and each gets dispatched without a second thought.Id like to think that on some level Berg is questioning the sense of a film -- and a foreign policy -- that makes target practice of our magnificent teams of hard-bodied hairy-chested rootin-tootin shootin parachutin double-cap-crimpin frogmen these soldiers who decorate their bunks with baby pictures of themselves next to an American flag and are so nobly eager to sacrifice their lives for each other and their country. But the ammo doesnt stop blasting long enough for their deaths to have weight. Instead Lone Survivor just reads like a quasi-political exaggeration of a slasher film the cellphones that dont work the rescuers just out of reach the killers chasing our victims through the woods.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Can a war movie be gruelingly committed to realism--to plunging audiences into the trenches to exposing them to battlefield horrors--and still feel like a gung-ho glorification of armed combat? Lone Survivor a visceral new benchmark in band-of-brothers cinema suggests that it can. The film is based on the 2007 memoir of former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell whose four-man team was charged with capturing a high-ranking Taliban leader in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan. As the title suggests the mission went FUBAR Pinned down by enemy fire the men put up a valiant fight but were too hopelessly outnumbered to emerge victorious. Only Luttrell lived to tell the tale thanks largely to the protection offered by villagers who stumbled upon him.Recreating this doomed last stand as a breathlessly intense action sequence Lone Survivor doesnt skimp on the sheer hellishness of the ordeal--the bullets tearing through flesh the bones shattering against rock etc. Yet in its unrelenting hyper-real way the film also cant quite resist viewing these unlucky grunts as fallen legends and paradigms of sheer macho perseverance. Theres a fine line between honoring the sacrifices of our men in uniform and romanticizing warfare itself. Director Peter Berg whos never been shy about his military fetish charges headlong across that line guns blazing and flag flapping. Remember this is the guy who closed his last picture the jingoistic Michael Bay imitation Battleship with a confused airing of CCRs ""Fortunate Son.""Theres a touch of the mythic to the films opening passage in which Mark Wahlberg--cast here as Luttrell--waxes poetic about the storm that exists inside warriors his voice-over musings set to a triumphantly rousing score by Explosions In The Sky. Luttrells comrades well played by Taylor Kitsch Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster are depicted as swell guys with good senses of humor. The hero worship is a bit overpowering during this early stretch but Lone Survivor picks up once the boys spring into action swapping half-amusing banter during scenes of stealthy reconnaissance. For all his directorial shortcomings Berg has a knack for capturing men at work; his depiction of special-ops maneuvering--of silently casing the enemy base of planning the attack--is as compelling as the chaotic violence he orchestrates later.Lone Survivor isnt completely nuance free. It reserves some respect for the Pashtun people whose codes of honor compelled them to protect Luttrell from the Taliban on his tail. Theres also a fine dramatically urgent sequence--that Luttrell is adamant isnt true to life--in which the four men heatedly debate what to do with a group of shepherds theyve captured weighing the ethics (and legality) of murder against the very real threat that these civilians will lead the enemy to them. Mostly however the film isnt much interested in the morality of war just the sheer ass-on-the-line gutsiness of those who fight in it. Furthermore Bergs salute to these fallen comrades would be more meaningful if he didnt resort so frequently to action-movie cliches. ""I am the reaper"" whispers Fosters stoic marksman as if aiming to unseat Barry Peppers character in Saving Private Ryan for the title of Coolest Sniper. Theres also a slow-motion shot of the whole team careening through the air an epic explosion sending them skyward and a scene in which Wahlbergs wounded hero gets unlikely assistance from a cute Afghan moppet. (Maybe thats pulled straight from the book but it feels like the hoariest of plot twists here.) You dont need to be a freedom-hating troop-disrespecting monster to see that Lone Survivor veers uncomfortably close to making war look like badass spectacle. At times it resembles a really violent well-acted recruitment ad--albeit one aimed mostly at masochists and pain freaks.

Still director Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights Battleship) goes into terrific detail about the 2005 mission that went horribly awry one ultimately undone by goat herders and American mercy.Like 2001s Oscar-winning Black Hawk Down another adaptation from a true military book history and title give Survivors ending away. But both films utilize such frenetic action and military savvy that the fate of the mission becomes secondary to the extraordinary details of it.Based on Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrells 2005 memoir by the same title Survivor spends little time on the backstory of the soldiers of Operation Red Wings the mission to take out Afghanistan militant Ahmad Shah that resulted in the deaths of 19 soldiers.STORY How Lone Survivor truth trumped HollywoodMORE Dealing with Lone Survivor woundsREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersWhile Survivors SEALs arent super soldiers theyre fearless. We meet a quartet of soldiers in Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) Lt. Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) and Petty Officers 2nd Class Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster). Under cover of darkness they hole up near a secluded village to target Shah a suspected Taliban fighter.Soon however the mission goes off the rails as the soldiers come across a group of goat herders. After questioning them the SEALs release the men who immediately notify Afghanistan militants who descend on the soldiers within hours.Once far from some of the hoo-rah dialogue and golden-hued images of men reminiscing about their best girls back home Survivor is a pummeling frenzied ride one of falls most charged action films. The gunfights and rocket-propelled grenades are palpable and Berg manages to make the chaos followable.Be warned Survivor is hard to watch. Berg spends too long on two perilous falls down the Afghanistan mountainside that shatter bones and shred skin. And the extended scene of Luttrell operating on his leg with an unwashed blade feels like overkill to get an R rating.But theres no denying the grit of the soldiers and the unexpected (and true) gesture by friendly Afghanistan villagers gives Survivor surprising heart. Survivor is bloody violent and not for the meek. But if Christmas stories are ultimately stories of sacrifice and honor then Bergs mission is a success. 96 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1c3o9bh",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/12/23/lone-survivor-movie-revew/4172349/,200,lonesurvivor32,lonesurvivor,usatoday

The film is based on The New York Times bestselling tale of heroism courage and survival. Photo Credit Universal advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The story of Operation Red Wings an Afghanistan mission that included Patchogue Navy SEAL Michael Murphy. Rated R (violence language) BOTTOM LINE The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with telling us who these fallen heroes really were. CAST Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Ben Foster LENGTH 201 ""Theres a storm inside of us"" Marcus Luttrell played by Mark Wahlberg tells us in ""Lone Survivor"" an account of the 2005 Navy SEAL mission known as Operation Red Wings. ""A burning river a drive"" he continues and he doesnt stop there. ""An unrelenting drive to push yourself farther than anyone could think possible."" This opening voice-over is a clue that ""Lone Survivor"" written and directed by Peter Berg from Luttrells memoir is more interested in the glamour of the Navy SEALs than in the men themselves. At its best the movie captures the terrible choices they made and the physical pain they endured to complete a task that they were given. But we never quite get to know them. ""Lone Survivor"" offers glorification with little characterization. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The film begins by introducing us to Luttrell and the others who would become the Red Wings group including Ben Foster as the hard-nosed Matt ""Axe"" Axelson Emile Hirsch as the excitable Danny Dietz and Taylor Kitsch as Patchogue-raised Michael Murphy already famous for his physical prowess and mental stamina. We see pictures of girlfriends and hear of plans for weddings though not much else distinguishes these men or the performances from each other. Once the SEALs begin their mission -- to penetrate Afghanistans Kunar province and find Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami) a Taliban kingpin -- ""Lone Survivor"" kicks into gear. Berg (""Battleship"") knows how to stage an action scene and the feeling of being pinned down by gunfire can be palpable. A dive off a craggy mountainside shows how desperate and how determined these SEALs were and how even their superhuman bodies have their limits. Still ""Lone Survivor"" often falls prey to video-game syndrome with our American avatars cherry-picking nameless bad guys from their posts. ""Lone Survivor"" rightly wants to honor the SEALs and you cant blame the movie for putting these supersoldiers on a macho pedestal. They made the ultimate sacrifice but the movie makes us feel it only symbolically. 541 VideoMichael Murphy An LI hero PLOT The story of Operation Red Wings an Afghanistan mission that included Patchogue Navy SEAL Michael Murphy. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (violence language) CAST Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Ben Foster LENGTH 201 BOTTOM LINE The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with telling us who these fallen heroes really were. 108 SuffolkMichael Murphy honored Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

As Noam Chomsky famously wrote with regard to the pervasive ""Support Our Troops"" campaign its ""a slogan that nobody is going to be against and I suppose everybody will be for."" In other words its a rather pathetic marketing coup that lays bear the desperation of promoting a grisly project not strong enough to speak on its own terms. (Imagine the posters for ""12 Years a Slave"" carrying the same phrase.) ""Lone Survivor"" is a grotesque action movie at times impressively directed by Peter Berg that combines the brute masculinity with the ugliness of the battlefield and viscerally unsettling shock value. But its less a depiction of courage than a brutish magnification of anger and pain both of which it conveys a lot better than the high ground that it reaches for. But boy does it reach. The opening training montage which sets the stage for the ensuing tense tale of a botched assassination mission in the Afghan countryside drags on and on throughout a prolonged credits sequence featuring documentary footage that may as well serve as a prolonged recruitment video. Its impressive to watch the Seals undergo extensive physical endurance tests just to prove how much theyve been toughened up for the missions at hand but its also a rather empty introduction for anyone who doesnt automatically relate to the process at hand that basically says These are guys tough. Is there nothing that can break them? Those boundaries are capably tested when a small group of soldiers including Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster) wind up in a prolonged firefight as their operation turns sour and survival prospects grow increasingly dim. ""Winning here is a conscious decision"" says their gruff commander (Eric Bana) ahead of the mission. Hurtling down a rocky mountainside while breaking bones and exchanging constant fire the men are battered into a bloody pulp as the body count rises -- its no spoiler to say that only one among them manages to escape the chaos with his life. The bulk of the movie takes place under these drab proceedings and Berg successfully ramps up the intensity with abrasive sound design and a rapid montage that constantly shifts between closeups of the frantic men and the speedy Taliban members lurking among the trees nearby. Like Bergs 2007s soldier drama ""The Kingdom"" the battle manages to convey a physically extreme process while at the same time feeling resoundingly empty. At least in Bergs ""Battleship"" the cartoonish belligerence operated under the guise of Hollywood escapism. No such luck in ""Lone Survivor"" which tries to use its gory visuals in service of blurry ideas about the nature of conflict. In ""Saving Private Ryan"" the prolonged opening battle sequence managed to the convey the hellish nature of war precisely because it felt so impersonal. But ""Lone Survivor"" plays up a lightweight message about good and evil once Wahlbergs character happens upon neutral Afghani villagers who offer him aid at a critical moment in the third act. Its a rather simplistic equation -- they fought hard for a reason you see -- that uses its non-fiction foundation like an excuse note. By the time it arrives at a coda filled with images of real life fallen soldiers set to a cover of David Bowies ""Heroes"" the movie has unapologetically transformed into a commercial memorial both lamenting the stakes of military conflict and saluting it. Without delving much into the paradoxes of modern warfare ""Lone Survivor"" embodies them. Criticwire Grade C HOW WILL IT PLAY? Opening December 27 in limited release ""Lone Survivor"" will hit theaters nationwide on January 10. The crowded year-end release calendar means it wont generate much box office heat at that time but it could benefit from beginning of the year exposure as most awards season movies will have been out for some time by then. Still it has slim prospects of a long-term performance.

How are your reviews being posted on metacritic Reply BigYalie May 12 2016 1248 pm I believe this critic means to say ""pro-military"" and not ""pro-militant."" The review is so poorly written and argue that it is difficult to understand precisely why he is criticizing the film. Is it a general critique of the American involvement in Afghanistan? A critique of target assassinations? A critique of the way Hollywood films glorify American soldiers? On all counts this critic is dead wrong. Reply Daric May 12 2016 1248 pm I find this to be a common theme in reviews of military movies. Critics want character development; otherwise the characters are irrelevant. While this is certainly true in lots of movies the nature of military service doesnt lend itself to a few minutes of fleshing out. Its difficult to flesh out the myriad motivations for why people join the service. I joined for college which makes me an unwilling participant in war to many civilians. That is until I tell them I enlisted during the Iraq surge and that I volunteered for deployment. Then Im back to being a complicit warrior for various corporate agendas murderer of children (never discharged my weapon not that it matters) ad nauseam. My point there is that whatever character development Peter Berg mightve chosen to do many veterans feel that civilians will fill in the blanks regardless of what our stories really are. I think a lot of civilians would simply find their stories unbelievable. Marcus Luttrell for example worked out with a former soldier for years in middle school and high school with the dream of being a SEAL. That doesnt fit the victim mold that increasing numbers of civilians are trying to fit veterans into. Surely there arent people who spend their formative years training hard to gain entry into a group of warriors right? Not in this age of enlightenment. As for it being a recruiting film the sagging economy did all the recruiting the military ever needed. Were turning people away or trying to find ways to get rid of the people we have. I think Congress mightve helped us with that one with the bill to cut our pensions. Nobodys going to abuse their bodies for 20 years and hope Congress will take care of them after theyre used up. Reply Evan May 12 2016 1248 pm War is never pretty and there are decisions made in battle that are always life altering. The depiction of that in a movie will never match what happens in real life in real time. Ever. Reply ozzy May 12 2016 1248 pm You are way off the deepend on this review.

For a fellow who went to a New England prep school and to college as a theater major he has a love -- almost a fetish -- for backs-to-the-wall spit-on-the-floor real men. Real violent men. The football players of ""Friday Night Lights"" the FBI agents of ""The Kingdom"" the sailors of the silly ""Battleship"" -- these are all clear-eyes full-hearts cant-lose kind of guys. Even Bergs bad-taste bachelor comedy ""Very Bad Things"" was about bloody male bonding. So having him make a film of a Navy SEAL mission might sound like a good thing especially of a mission that went disastrously wrong. A man fighting on against all odds is inspiring. But a man fighting on against literally impossible odds -- that can show a special kind of grace. Ernest Hemingway knew that. Howard Hawks too. Peter Berg though is -- well kind of a lunkhead whose movies are the equivalent of a beery ""I love you man"" embrace in the parking lot. Theyre loud and sloppy but full more of sentimentality than sentiment rough outbursts than real feelings. In EMBED manually add this fix ""Lone Survivor"" -- which right from its title is clearly not too interested in suspense -- is the true story of Seal Team 10 which in 2005 was part of Operation Red Wings a mission to take out a prominent and powerful Taliban leader. Suddenly discovered and outnumbered in enemy territory the four men had one option Stand and fight. This is the sort of bare-bones story that well served plenty of World War II movies once and it would work here if Berg had the sense to develop these men as characters first. But we dont really get to know any of them or what they might bring personally to this life-or-death emergency. What are their own skills weaknesses fears? They never become much more than four very tough men and as wrenching as the firefight is -- and Berg seems to take particular pleasure in throwing his heroes off every mountain he can find - it never becomes personal. We shouldnt only care about these people because theyre Americans. We should care because we know them. N.J.

Although the film hits starts off badly (with an over-the-top almost fetishized montage of SEALs in training being put through seven kinds of hell) and ends worse (with a lugubriously slow version of David Bowies -- yes -- ""Heroes"") the middle is at least competently staged with a few surprises if you dont remember the history. And while Taylor Kitsch yet again serves merely as handsome set direction and Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster only give flashes of their usual energy Mark Wahlberg -- who is the only movie star here -- does what movie stars do He takes a part which barely exists on the page and somehow slips it on like a glove. But theres still no real character here and no point to the movie outside of the obvious resilience and courage of the men involved. Thats worth celebrating sure -- but even more its worth truly dramatizing which requires some thought and dialogue. And some directorial point of view beyond ""MAN these guys are cool"" Ratings note The film contains strong language and gory violence. Lone Survivor (R) Universal (121 min.) Directed by Peter Berg. With Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch Emile Hirsch Ben Foster.

Writer-director Peter Bergs new pie-eyed paean to the American military adapted from Marcus Luttrells nonfiction book of the same name chronicles a real-life mission gone wrong--2005s Operation Red Wings. A four-man Navy SEAL team (Mark Wahlberg Ben Foster Emile Hirsch and Taylor Kitsch) is dropped into Afghanistan tasked with assassinating a high-ranking Taliban leader. Unfortunately these mighty mercenaries are quickly discovered by civilian goatherds after which things go south very quickly. Lone Survivor is war porn of the highest order relishing every bloody bullet hit and Dolby-accentuated bone crunch while trading in the most facile armed-conflict ironies. Berg treats the SEAL team like cartoon symbols of American sacrifice--in one sequence several of them even roll down the steep side of a cliff like Wile E. Coyote thwarted by jihadist Road Runners. Those evil Afghans meanwhile twirl their mustaches plenty in the first act which of course portends the appearance of a bunch of saintly ones in the third. Berg may be adhering to the basic facts but his movies childish machismo is a disgrace to all involved.

A single star review for a movie that rightly portrays the Navy Seals as exactly what they are - some of the best among us - only demonstrates what Uhlich sees as having a sense of meaning.

CortezFeaturedThe film gets five stars from me. Your review labeling the SEALs as mercenaries is disgraceful.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 10 2014KevinFeaturedThis really is a very unusual review. As a critic you are of course allowed to dislike a movie so if you didnt like this one then you certainly shouldnt be attacked by those that disagree with your critical opinion. But your language goes so far beyond the scope of the film that it is jarring. Mercenaries are killers for hire swearing fealty to the highest bidder. That is why the English language has a distinct word that clearly separates them from a soldier and certainly from a Navy seal who signs up to serve his country knowing full well his compensation is in the form of Duty served not dollars paid. Saying that this movie is a disgrace to all involved because of the way it pays the soldiers machismo similarly ignores the basic fact that the movie was made hand in hand with the one person who was actually involved. I assume you would feel ashamed to have told this man to his face that his service and his attempt to honor his fallen comrades we disgraceful so why do it in a review? I happen to be one of those""anti-war lefties""everyone is accusing you of being but there is a difference between attacking a policy and attacking person. To attack the person youd better have a solid basis for believing theyve renounced national loyalty and youd definitely need to have a damn good reason for accusing the man who experienced these events of creating a disgraceful portrayal of his fallen brothers. The movie sucking doesnt meet the high bar necessary to legitimize the language youve used. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 10 2014GeorgeFeaturedDoes Keith actually get paid for his drivel?

A review of all Keith Uhlichs reviews on Metacritic shows he frequently rates movies 10-20 points below or above the average (on a scale of 100). Movies he likes often are 5 starts / 100 points. Movies he doesnt like are 1 star or 20 points. His reviews are frequently short 2-4 paragraphs with catchy phrasing. He has history of making extreme statements. Perhaps he has no ability see anything other than flaws or gloss....or maybe he is just watching the trailer and not watching the actual movie....Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 8 2014Bill GreavesFeaturedThe most harrowing intense moving and sincere movies about war friendship sacrifice and consequences ever made.

This review was disgusting. I cant testify to how accurate it is to actual events because I would never have the courage to be there. However I dont see any macho b.s. anywhere. Men that put themselves in that position have to have that macho arrogance or they wouldnt be able to do it. This man should never review a movie again. Not for his opinion but for his UN questionable ignorance.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 4 2014JoeDFeaturedI had to check this critics review because it scored the movie so uncommonly low compared to the majority of others on IMDb. It took me all of about 15 seconds to recognize his agenda frame it as a caricatured B-studio war flick with unrealistic action in the hopes other Americans wont go see it. He certainly doesnt want anyone to come away sympathetic of those who lost their lives or were gravely injured. Id also challenge the notion that hes ever read Luttrells book. If he had theres no way he could admit Berg kept the details true while in the same breath bemoaning the firefight scenes as macho embellishment. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 3 2014ChrisFeaturedKeith Uhlich is small time small man and small brain. Doesnt have a following and is probably trying to stir up controversy to get more hits/views on his ridiculous ""expert"" reviews. His writing gives him away calling Navy SEALs mercenaries really?? I actually laughed when I read that and knew that Mr. Uhlich would not be a legitimate critic. (Is that an oxymoron?) Anyways enjoy the 17 comments and what 30-50 views you stirred up. Great work. Lol.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 3 2014DanFeaturedHave you ever researched the Navy Seals or the training or selection process that you are required to go through if you intend to become one? I think not otherwise you wouldnt be so quick to label them mercenaries or ridicule the actions happening in the movie. These men were selected because they have the drive ambition willpower or whatever you want to call it to get through and survive despite impossible odds. It is said that the average SEAL can do ten times the amount of work as the average human being and I believe it so. No I think you are angry because this looks like another Act of Valor to you. Obviously you havent given enough interest to do your own research into these unique individuals and thus you have no idea what it takes to do what these men do or endure what they can. Go eat a d and continue writing whatever goofy nonsense you normally put up. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 1 2014MonikaFeaturedI have just seen the movie and have read the book as well and from the review I believe Mr. Uhlich has either not understood the concept of the movie at all or slept through it otherwise I cant understand how could he have written such poor quality review. One can disagree with the concept of war as such or war in Afganistan but to disrespect in such a fashion as Mr. Uhlich did in his review the SEALS sacrificies that the movie is obviously trying to portray as realistically as possible is disgusting.

SpartyHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 30 2013CTPFeatureddc-youre an idiot. Nobody is saying that this movie is anything close to being Oscar worthy. Peter Berg made this movie with the intent of keeping it as accurate as possible. Thats why he had the ""Lone Survivor"" on set with actors every single day...along with many other NAVY SEALS. He wanted to make a movie that would play tribute to what we go through every day. He didnt have the intention of seeing Oscars with this movie. He wanted the story to be seen by all of us AMERICANS. Simply the story as accurately as it could be shown. We know the critics job is to focus on the movie. However it is quite possible they get to involved with critiquing and focus less on the overall point.

Hes reviewing the MOVIE its not an insult to anyones memory because he didnt like it. Wahlburg is not a great actor. The story is very hyper-action pro USA and you cant deny it. So if one doesnt like it it doesnt make them anti-American. Similar to Act of Valor you could guess at scenes (navy seal HALO jump anyone) or SEALs yelling ""Go go go"" I would only peg the movie as a run of the mill action movie if not for the fact it is based on a true story.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 25 2013joeFeaturedThose who read the book shouldve guessed how lefties would react.

He may want to stick to reviewing Roadrunner cartoons if he is looking for material that will not offend his personal political sensibilities. As an honoree receiving the Medal of Honor for his actions Michael Murphy should not be compared to wily coyote and has been vetted as a hero deserving our nations highest military honor.

Alas the movie is indeed propaganda and carries itself as a cheesy action film complete with groan-inducing stunts that are over dramatized such as the 4 soldiers jumping in unison to narrowly avoid an RPG or a Taliban soldier spending time beating on Mark (which just happens to give reinforcements just enough time to reach the village) instead of just shooting him. He HAD a freaking AK but instead he punched and kicked Wahlberg around. If he had no ammo he couldve at least smashed his head in with the butt. Those soldiers didnt seem reluctant to shoot the other 3 soldiers back in the mountains... makes no sense.

Peters/Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Lone Survivor Needs to be recalibrated. Running time 121 minutes. Rated R (profanity graphic war violence). Opens Dec. 25 at the Lincoln Square Broadway and W. 68th St. If a movie in which every Navy SEAL but one dies violently can be a feature-length recruitment video ""Lone Survivor"" is it. There hasnt been this bizarre mixture of hooah and death since John Wayne hung up his combat boots. If the title doesnt give away the ending the opening does Mark Wahlberg as SEAL Marcus Luttrell who wrote the memoir upon which the film is based describes his salvation from a bloody 2005 battle with the Taliban in Afghanistan in which all of his teammates (as well as a separate hastily assembled group of would-be rescuers) were killed. Writer-director Peter Berg the ""Friday Night Lights"" creator (and evidently one of Hollywoods more patriotic voices) is fascinated maybe even a little awed with the rigor and camaraderie of the famously skilled SEALs. A training-camp sequence emphasizes agony and brotherhood in equal measure and the takeaway from the film is that the latter is well worth the former. Put me down as not quite convinced. Luttrell and squadmates Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt ""Axe"" Axelson (Ben Foster) are sent into the mountains on a mission to assassinate a Taliban leader. Instead they are surprised by shepherds which leaves them the seeming only options of killing these civilians or letting them go and risk having their cover blown to the enemy. The shepherds yield clues that they might be informers. The most disturbing element of Bergs script is that he seems to think the former course would have been the wiser one Troops should waste any civilian who might be with the bad guys. War is messy but its also not an excuse for wanton slaughter. The rest of the movie is one bloody horrible (but macho) killing scene after another and right to the end the boys keep joshing and joking and lobbing one-liners in a way that sounds much more like a Hollywood screenwriter with his feet on the desk than men facing their mortality. Nor does the legendary fitness of the SEALs really come into play The brawniest physique wont save you when youre bounding backwards down a mountain your helmetless head getting slammed into a tree trunk. Berg does convey a sense of what it must have been like for those men to fight and die on that mountain -- the intensity the determination the desolation. The visuals are gripping the sound effects magnificent. But to what end? This is a movie about an irrelevant skirmish that ended in near-total catastrophe during a war we are not winning. The nearest analogue I could think of was ""Black Hawk Down"" but Ridley Scotts dirge didnt affect the larkish tone of Bergs in which every man seems to think hes in a merry adventure. Pull back a bit from the jingoism and its hard to see what was purchased with so much brave young blood.

Daily Edition Login to download Lone Survivor Film Review 926 PM PST 11/12/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS An intense look at 19 American deaths and one survival in a vividly re-created chapter of the fighting in Afghanistan. TWITTER Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch and Emile Hirsch star in director Peter Bergs adaptation of the war memoir by ex-Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell. The recent vogue for extreme solitary survival tales -- Life of Pi All Is Lost Gravity -- continues with another significant entry in Lone Survivor. A very intense close-up visualization of the best-selling memoir about a botched Navy SEALs raid in Afghanistan written by the only man who lived to tell the tale Marcus Luttrell Peter Bergs film rates comparisons to Black Hawk Down as an unflinching account of a U.S. military operation in the Middle East gone very wrong. The film is concerned only with what directly confronts the characters -- and by extension the audience -- at any given moment. But even without any discernable political tilt in the point of view other than for a clear enthusiasm for gung ho manliness no spectator will be able to avoid pondering the question Is such sacrifice worth it? Given the grim and painful nature of much of the drama even critical plaudits and heavy promotion will have trouble pushing this Universal release beyond mid-level box office success. Berg reportedly underwent at least a semblance of SEALs initiation in preparation for the film and the celebration of the he-man camaraderie stemming from the rigorous training period is certainly infectious early in the film. As is well known these guys are the elite of the elite the most physically fit the best armed the ones equipped with top survival skills and know-how. These men will not let you or each other down. VIDEO First Lone Survivor Trailer Shows Mark Wahlberg Taylor Kitsch on a Mission Gone Wrong But theyre not superheroes either as is soon be illustrated in graphic bone-crunching skin-shredding detail. Under cover of night on June 27-28 2005 four SEALs are quietly dropped by helicopter into rugged mountains from which the men can view a village and possibly neutralize a Taliban bigwig and bin Laden insider who holds sway there and allegedly killed 20 Marines the week before. The quartet consists of Lt. Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) Petty Officer 1st Class Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) and Petty Officers 2nd Class Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster). Radio communication is sketchy but good enough they believe to rely on. In the morning their mission is compromised when a local shepherd and two youngsters presumably his sons spot them. The SEALs easily catch them but a major moral crisis arises Do they kill them and proceed with their mission tie them up (which they reject as simply delayed execution as wild animals would surely attack them) or let them go? Despite the fact that the younger boy looks like a guaranteed rat Murphy the officer in charge decides to release them. But the Americans cant establish radio contact to arrange for a pickup and in no time at all armed Taliban are everywhere. With hindsight one wonders if it might not have been possible to bind the shepherds and hold them while waiting for a rescue helicopter and then release them. Murphys fateful decision to extend them the benefit of the doubt appears primarily driven by fear of possible media charges of murdering civilians and a follow-up investigation. What the Americans get instead is a ferocious firefight that for about a half-hour approaches Saving Private Ryan-opening reel mayhem. Given the artillery power of Americans many Taliban members go down but they keep on coming -- and with increasingly powerful weapons including rocket-propelled grenades. VIDEO Behind the Scenes of Lone Survivor As the foursome moves around seeking better protection and fighting positions on a craggy irregularly wooded landscape they more injured by the minute. They are ripped by bullets and cut up by explosions and flying debris. To emphasize the trauma of impact when the men tumble down a rocky slope Berg begins in slow-motion and then he shifts -- wham -- into high gear the moment they slam into trees or rocks. This automatically makes you flinch. Unfortunately it also yanks you out of the experience and into an awareness of the artifice creating instant distance. Thereafter the intensity remains and even increases when the men jump off a steep cliff and land like rag dolls on rocks. But the increasing emphasis on bravura technique simultaneously results in a certain detachment. Its as if Berg felt compelled to one-up directors who have impressed with such bloody set-pieces in the past -- Peckinpah Penn Spielberg Bigelow you name them -- thus hoping to join this elite list of action filmmakers. Bergs work here is at the top of his range as previously displayed in Friday Night Lights and his other Middle East-set film The Kingdom and a far cry from his cringe-worthy most recent outing Battleship even though his key collaborators -- cinematographer Tobias A. Schliessler editor Colby Parker Jr. and composer Steve Jablonsky -- carry over from that job. The film is rugged skilled relentless determined narrow-minded and focused everything that a soldier must be when his life is on the line. Lone Survivor no doubt accomplishes everything it wants to achieve It drops the viewer right in with the SEALs makes you admire their toughness bravery and abilities and puts you through the wringer. It also makes you realize that if theyre forced to make a tough decision it might not be the right one. When Luttrells three colleagues eventually succumb to their innumerable wounds and a rescue chopper carrying eight more SEALs and eight Army soldiers is shot down by the Taliban making for 19 American fatalities in all the specter of tragedy and senseless loss suffuses everything and is repeated again at the end when photographs of the real-life soldiers and their loved ones parade by one by one. For Luttrell after all the other deaths survival is still a long shot and suspense stretches across his period of partial recovery while being hidden in a small village thats constantly subjected to Taliban inspection. One imagines theres a movie in what happens in Afghanistan everyday and mostly they would likely inspire the same question Is it worth it? Wahlberg at 42 is significantly older than Luttrell (29 at the time of the incident) or any of the 19 killed in the incident but he still has the right stuff to convince the audience as a tough and super-fit SEAL whose breaking point is far beyond the norm. Kitsch Foster and Hirsch are fully on the same page of intensity which is the main requirement here beyond physicality. Craft and technical contributions are united in the cause of rough-and-ready realism. The rocky forested mountains and expansive deserts of New Mexico plausibly stand in for Afghan locations.

Leaving the summer-movie frivolity of ""Battleship"" behind him writer-director Peter Berg delivers his most serious-minded work to date with ""Lone Survivor"" a scorching often unbearably brutal account of a June 2005 military mission that claimed the lives of 19 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistans Kunar province. Adapted from the eyewitness narrative of now-retired Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell this dramatic reconstruction of the ill-fated Operation Red Wings is perhaps the most grueling and sustained American combat picture since ""Black Hawk Down"" as well as a prime example of how impressive physical filmmaking can overcome even fundamental deficiencies in script and characterization. Bergs blunt pummeling style offers few nuances and makes no apologies but his broad brushstrokes have clearly found an ideal canvas in this grimly heroic rendering of hell on earth.This story first appeared in the November 19 2013 issue of Variety.

Given the publics general aversion to movies about Americas post-9/11 incursions into the Middle East (a rare exception like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" notwithstanding) it remains an open question whether the Universal release will resonate commercially when it begins a limited run Dec. 27 followed by a wide opening Jan. 10. Still a strong awards push and appreciative reviews should stir interest in a picture that despite the sometimes numbing effect of its nonstop carnage builds shrewdly to a cathartic and surprising conclusion. And while Bergs relentless can-you-take-this depiction of courage under fire will be most ardently embraced by viewers on the right Luttrells survival story has its own built-in moral complexities that should strike a chord with audiences regardless of political persuasion. There has been no shortage of Iraq War films in recent years but no studio picture has addressed the still-ongoing conflict in Afghanistan at such length and detail as ""Lone Survivor."" The thrust here is decidedly personal rather than analytical presenting one of the worst disasters in special-forces history as a mournful tribute to Luttrells fallen comrades; those seeking a more expansive history of the conflict an understanding of the enemy mindset or a critical interrogation of Americas war on terror should look elsewhere. Still in clearing a narrative path through the authors unabashedly patriotic memoir (co-written with Patrick Robinson) Berg has attempted to honor his subjects without jingoism largely eliminating Luttrells gung-ho rhetoric and attacks on the ""liberal media"" whose insistence on strict rules of engagement he partly blames for endangering him and his men in the first place. Roughly the books entire first half is compressed into the films opening-credits sequence a training-footage montage that bracingly suggests the near-impossible levels of physical strength mental toughness and overall stamina it takes to join the ranks of the Navy SEALs. Among these elite soldiers are Hospital Corpsman Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) a 29-year-old Texas native and his buddies Lt. Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) Gunners Mate Danny P. Dietz (Emile Hirsch); and Sonar Technician Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson (Ben Foster) all deployed to Afghanistan in 2005. Berg is no stranger to enclaves of American masculinity (""Friday Night Lights"") or infernos in the Middle East (""The Kingdom"") but ""Lone Survivors"" life-in-the-military prologue doesnt inspire much confidence The character delineation is weak the observations pedestrian the style marred by recruitment-video aesthetics all grinding voiceover and overactive music (by the never-subtle Steve Jablonsky and the instrumental rock band Explosions in the Sky). Compared with the intimacy and insight of ""Restrepo"" Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetheringtons 2010 documentary about Army troops in Afghanistan the blend of camaraderie and competitiveness here comes off as second-rate macho bluster. But the film begins to find its footing as it lays out the strategic groundwork for Operation Red Wings a mission targeting Taliban commander Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami) and his fighters in the mountains of Kunar where Murphy Luttrell Dietz and Axelson are sent in as a surveillance-and-reconnaissance team. Trouble arises when the four SEALs despite having carefully concealed themselves along the slopes of Sawtalo Sar are discovered by a trio of Afghan goatherds. While these unarmed civilians do not appear connected with the Taliban their hostility is readily apparent and the SEALs must decide whether to ensure the goatherds silence by killing them -- the correct decision from a tactical standpoint -- or to release them in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. After some glib but tense debate about the potential ramifications of either option the team led by Murphy votes to free them. Confirming the SEALs worst fears the youngest of the goatherds is shown racing down the mountain -- in unnecessary faux-suspenseful slow-motion -- to inform the Taliban leaders. As clumsy as the filmmaking can be in these moments Bergs inelegant style turns fully immersive once the deadly ambush begins Theres a chilling moment when Luttrell and his men glimpse Shahs men lined up along a distant ridge driving home just how outnumbered they are (about 140 to four) their slim chances of survival further weakened by their inability to contact HQ. The long roughly 40-minute sequence that follows is a blood-spattered tour de force of physical mayhem as the SEALs are beset on all sides by Taliban fighters raining down bullets and rocket-propelled grenades from their advantageous positions higher up the mountain. As Luttrell and his men return fire racking up no shortage of Taliban casualties what registers is not just the ferocity of the action or the terrifying omnipresence of the enemy but also the ruggedness of the terrain (New Mexico stood in for Afghanistan). Colby Parker Jr.s jittery editing and Tobias Schliessers shallow limited-vantage compositions are ideally suited to the horrors of this rough-and-tumble warfare and for all the agony of bullets ripping through flesh the cruelest moments are those in which the SEALs seek cover by hurling themselves downhill the rocks and branches becoming lethally sharp obstacles beneath their feet. Thanks in particular to excellent sound work (by mixer David Brownlow) and fearsome stunt coordination by Kevin Scott every fall scrape and curse registers with tremendous impact. Of particular note is the special-effects makeup work by Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger devising ghastly prosthetic injuries that the camera observes in unsparing closeup; even viewers who profess to have seen it all will be hard-pressed not to flinch. While the storys sobering outcome is clear enough from the title the chain of events by which Luttrell emerges from this ordeal -- including a daring helicopter rescue attempt staged with startling immediacy -- will prove engrossing and ultimately quite moving for those not already in the know. Bergs script actually improves on (and necessarily truncates) the books unwieldy telling by withholding contextual details until the end allowing the viewer to appreciate the full measure of Luttrells fear and disorientation until his ultimate recovery. Suffice to say that while ""Lone Survivor"" naturally invites debate as to whether or not the SEALs were right to let the goatherds go free that courageous deed is later mirrored by another from an entirely unexpected source; together these bookending incidents form an implicit argument about the power of individual acts of conscience amid the moral murkiness of war. Each of Luttrells three slain comrades gets his courageous final moment enshrined with last-stand heroics and additional use of slow-mo. Yet the heart-swelling solemnity of these scenes is undercut by the fact that Wahlbergs co-stars havent been given many opportunities to individuate their characters beyond standard demonstrations of bravery battle-readiness fury and despair. Still the actors acquit themselves well in and out of combat with the ever-chameleonlike Foster disappearing the most into his role as Axe every bit as sharp and deadly as his nickname. Kitsch like Berg a refugee from ""Battleship"" shows his own promising signs of career rehabilitation here as Murphy the teams goodhearted self-sacrificing leader. Hirsch brings a touch of callowness to the part of Dietz the youngest among them but no less a fighter to the end. Whether hes trying to calm his more hotheaded brothers in arms or pulling shrapnel out of his leg Wahlbergs Luttrell provides a steady emotional anchor his toughness leavened by a sense of vulnerable humanity. Of the other actors Eric Bana offers a welcome familiarity as Lt. Cmdr. Erik S. Kristensen seen primarily in cutaways back to HQ. While the Arab thesps have been cast primarily on the basis of their ability to look menacing and wield an AK-47 Ali Suliman (recently seen in ""The Attack"") has a crucial role in the third act testifying to the cultural and political complexity of a nation where not every man in a turban is necessarily an enemy.

Human says November 13 2013 at 838 am Finally someone mentions the incredible work Kitsch did as Lt. Murphy. Kitsch captures Lt. Murphys essence with such seamless ease its a marvel to watch. Not surprising after his jarring portrayal of the late Kevin Carter in the Bang Bang Club. Definitely the most underrated young actor out there. Reply Michael Anthony says November 13 2013 at 543 am That isnt the point of the film or review. If thats what you want find it elsewhere. This is about a group of men a hard decision they have to make while understanding the ramifications of the decision they do make. And then how they face those consequences. Reply GeorgeValentin says November 13 2013 at 458 am ""Lone Survivor"" wont survive ""12 Years A Slave"" on Oscar night. Reply R.G. studios (RG_internet_Art) says November 13 2013 at 1232 am 2 choices kill them or tie them up rule books dont apply in war leting them go is NOT repeat NOT an option your in combat territory war.... any man of war would know this. your location would be compromise YOUR Life is at Risk here... free the men and what follows is expected...dont be foolish as your being moral..

Mark and Donnie Wahlberg Serving Wahlburgers for Aamp;E Lone Survivor Screening Scores on Strength of Mark Wahlberg Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell Saving Mr. Banks Review Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks Are Spit-Spot-On in This Hollywood Valentine Peter Bergs powerful docudrama features some of the most intense combat sequences since ""Saving Private Ryan"" War films dont all follow the same strategy. Stanley Kubricks ""Paths of Glory"" for instance depicts a microcosm of societys worst elements with the ruling elite watching the carnage from a safe distance and pinning any and all mistakes on their powerless underlings. Then youve got something like ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" which reminds us that there is no glory in war and no winners either. Battle is ugly horrifying and dehumanizing and war itself is a condition that is anathema to the human experience. To that latter category add writer-director Peter Bergs powerful new film ""Lone Survivor"" based on the true story of Marcus Luttrell (played here by Mark Wahlberg) who was part of a mission in Afghanistan that went so horribly wrong that...well lets just say the title is a spoiler. Berg doesnt overload the exposition or character development instead taking us through a typical morning with Luttrell and his comrades Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch who previously teamed with Berg on ""Battleship"") Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster). They distract themselves with competitions (Murphy and Dietz race around their base) and banter but are primed for the work at hand. Also read Lone Survivor Screening Scores on Strength of Mark Wahlberg Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell Their superior Lt. Cmdr. Erik Kristensen (Eric Bana) lays out their latest assignment to take out Ahmed Shahd (Yousuf Azami) a Taliban fighter responsible for the deaths of 20 Marines in the last week alone. Our four heroes find themselves in a mountain above the village where intel says Shahd is hiding out but their cover is blown by a passing crew of goatherds. Murphy and Axelson argue over whether or not to kill them -- on the one hand witnesses could jeopardize the mission but then theres also the issue of how CNN will cover troops shooting unarmed civilians -- and when the decision is made to let them go the Americans quickly find themselves under fire. This leads into the powerful centerpiece of ""Lone Survivor"" a real-time combat sequence that portrays the danger and the terror of warfare as effectively as any movie since ""Saving Private Ryan."" The editing and sound work here is masterful as these actors effectively portray the mix of resourcefulness and helplessness the real soldiers must have felt in this desperate situation. (Kudos as well to the stuntmen who had to do a lot of rolling down mountains and off cliffs.) The film never makes a grand statement about whether or not the war in Afghanistan is per se a mistake but it does portray war itself as a disgusting folly. Berg sets up the cathartic moments were used to in movies like this but then he pulls out the rug reminding us that the cavalry doesnt always miraculously show up in time to save the day. See video Mark Wahlberg Is the Lone Survivor of SEAL Team 10 in New Trailer ""Lone Survivor"" tells its story in a low-key way managing to keep the human element front and center; amazingly it avoids entirely demonizing the enemy as we see that some Afghanis were willing to risk their lives to provide sanctuary for the broken and bleeding Luttrell. Wahlberg gives another spectacularly unshowy performance; as with ""The Fighter"" he never grandstands or reminds us how much acting hes doing but hes ferociously in the moment at all times. The cast in general is excellent -- if there are standouts they would definitely include Foster (if you dont believe hes one of contemporary films most chameleonic actors watch his work here and in ""Kill Your Darlings"" back to back) and Alexander Ludwig (""The Hunger Games"") as a baby-faced new arrival who gets immediately plunged into the worst that war has to offer. Also read Hunger Games Catching Fire Review Jennifer Lawrences Katniss Everdeen Burns Brighter Than Ever If theres one big disappointment here it comes when we see the photos of the actual soldiers -- Bergs cast looks a lot less ethnically-diverse than the real squadron a regrettable lapse in a film that seems otherwise doggedly interested in authenticity. It will be interesting to see how viewers along the ideological spectrum will interpret ""Lone Survivor"" mainly because the film itself eschews politics and partisanship. We need a constant reminder that war is indeed hell no matter what the motivations or rationalizations behind it. Whether or not you think troops should be sent into battle ""Lone Survivor"" presents a gutting portrayal of what happens when they get there. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
