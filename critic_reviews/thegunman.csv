"Armed and Tedious Sean Penn Bulks Up for The Gunman and Shailene Woodley Gets Stuck in Insurgent << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Armed and Tedious Sean Penn Bulks Up for The Gunman and Shailene Woodley Gets Stuck in Insurgent Open Road Films Movies March 20 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Sean Penn now has a body that invites scientific study. The veins in his arms are the size of fire hoses. His pecs and abs converge to form a diamond in the upper middle of his trunk. These are the things you tend to notice in The Gunman because the frequency with which Penn is half-naked is not unnoticeable. You notice not because his shirtlessness is sexy but because it feels pathologically vain. Hes playing an American operative named Jimmy Terrier whose assassination of a Congolese mining minister sets off a series of international calamities -- for him. Penn moves from scene to scene almost solely to find new excuses to wear nothing. Hes 54 and the prominence of his body is a matter of prerogative. At that age when youve still got it flaunt it. But Penn doesnt simply flaunt it. He Stallones it. The opening minutes put you in a hopeful place. Broadcast news footage establishes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is under siege. Civilians are caught in a cross fire featuring the government rebel militiamen and private contractors battling for control over the countrys coveted western-bound natural resources. Thousands have been killed injured and displaced. Members of NGOs are risking their lives to save lives. The ground is laid for a decent political thriller. More The Gunman Armed and Tedious Sean Penn Bulks Up For The Gunman Qamp;A Director Pierre Morel on The Gunman Taken and Inventing the Vengeance-of-Liam-Neeson Genre Peaks and Valleys The Career of Sean Penn But within five minutes the movie declares its true priorities. Jimmy saunters into a Kinshasa bar toting a mustache looking for his lady love -- Annie (Jasmine Trinca) a doctor at a camp -- the very lady for whom his pal Felix (Javier Bardem) has the hots. You cant believe war-torn Congo is being used as the backdrop for the love triangle scene in Tequila Sunrise but here we are with Jimmy making out with and waking up beside Annie who rises from bed and proceeds in sunlit splendor to do the beautiful-woman-stands-on-a-balcony-wearing-only-a-mans-dress-shirt thing. After the assassination Jimmy has to vanish on Annie and the contracting company which eight years later has spread -- cancerously one presumes -- around the globe. He resurfaces off the coast of Africa topless on a surfboard (wetsuits are for pussies; so apparently are mustaches since Jimmys is gone). He rises from the water like Botticellis Spicoli. Now Jimmy is do-gooding for a well-digging NGO breaking all the rules (catching waves is a security risk). One afternoon mid-dig a quartet of rebels comes after him and he obliterates three of them (his shell-shocked assistant shoots the fourth). What do they want? Whoever sent them needed a vial of Jimmys blood for confirmation of his death. Worried he flies to Europe for answers from his old colleagues. One guy (Mark Rylance) is near the top of the company and knows nothing. Felix is in Barcelona shacked up with Annie and refuses to let Jimmy have her back. These alas are the stakes for a movie titled The Gunman and gratuitously featuring an actual humanitarian crisis as a backdrop The girl is mine. So we get a fancy-restaurant scene with these three in which Jimmy surprises Annie by showing up and Bardem surprises us by being terrible. His acting here is so gassy that each of his scenes ought to end with ""excuse me."" Hes bad with gusto of course. ""Youre humiliating me"" says Annie to Felix. ""The way you stare at him humiliates you"" he replies with a hiss. She flees Jimmy chases after her gives her his address to give to Felix and a scene later opens the door and finds her standing before him ready to lock mouths and genitalia. Kinshasas burning but who cares? This sex is on fire too. Annie is a musty Marion Cotillard-Penelope Cruz part. Trincas from Italy and in Italian (and with actual writing) she can act. Here shes somewhere between Isabella Rossellini and a bulbless lamp. Trincas here for the movies villain to kidnap and drag to the climax at a Barcelona bullring where an almost enjoyably stupid kitchen-sink finale awaits. Before that Annie and Felixs country villa is so extravagantly demolished that you hope theyve got action-movie insurance. Ray Winstone and Idris Elba turn up for cruelly brief bits and Rylance proves he cant think of a reason not to go to town on any acting assignment. Has there been a movie to span such a gamut of sleazy-sexy men? In Spain youd call it morbo. Penns rendition thinks it warrants ambassadorship. I object to The Gunman because its unconvincing and incoherent. It gives Jimmy post-concussive head trauma which causes him excruciating blackouts and reflects the state of mind in which this movie appears to have been concocted. Director Pierre Morel also did the original District B13 the first Taken and the fragrant stink bomb From Paris With Love each of which rocketed off Luc Bessons assembly line. This is a Joel Silver production so it prioritizes ""boom"" over ""LOL."" Without Bessons sense of the consciously absurd Morel is left to conjure his own version. Thats how you wind up with that bullring sequence. But the whole movie feels commissioned as if Penn saw Liam Neeson and John Travolta and thought Stunt doubles are also for pussies. Stab me Dislocate my shoulder Im gonna win the scene. And Ill smoke many cigarettes as I do (Anton Corbijns The American with George Clooney as an assassin in Europe was a sleepier artier less steroidal trot over similar terrain.) Penn takes a screenplay credit on The Gunman shared with Don Macpherson and Pete Travis. Its a puffed-up misapprehension of the pure pulp of Jean-Patrick Manchettes The Prone Gunman from 1981. That puffing up leads to my second objection. Why bother with all of this international intrigue just to treat Penns body as a tourist attraction? By the time hes running around that stadium wearing only a bulletproof vest above the waist youre certain youre seeing a parody of vanity except Penns acting in the last 20 years has become so generally joyless that he makes you feel blasphemous for laughing at him. This is the problem with his inside joke at last months Academy Awards to Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Who gave this guy a green card?""). You dont know how to laugh with Sean Penn because he doesnt seem to find himself funny. When Tom Cruise is half-dressed in a film you can cheer his ridiculousness -- he practically turns himself on. What turns Penn on about himself often seems to have little to do with the movies. Hes among the cause-iest of stars having dipped a steel-toed boot into one political quagmire after the next. A Hollywood activist like Angelia Jolie survives this disjunction between being an action figure and a humanitarian because she works mostly in the realms of melodrama science fiction and fantasy. But touristic self-importance pollutes The Gunman. Penns preening obstructs your view of atrocity. He doesnt care that like the ""Jimmy"" Neesons currently playing in Run All Night and the ""Jimmy"" Penn played in Mystic River these are immoral heroes given heroizing plots. Stardom is its own morality. Now its as if Penn cant do a lousy action movie without even a patina of world betterment. But the world hes trying to better here feels pitifully tiny -- its his own.  Andrew Cooper/LionsgateI feel bad for these Divergent movies. Theyre a mess mostly because the Veronica Roth books theyre based on are a mess too. I appreciate the attempt to try to make this world -- an obliterated totalitarian Chicago -- as watchable as possible. But theres too much to keep straight. The first movie explained that the citys been carved into five factional camps determined by aptitude and personality type Abnegation Amity Candor Dauntless and Erudite. Some are Factionless. The seriess hero Tris (Shailene Woodley) is most rare a multi-factional called a Divergent. The second movie -- Insurgent -- keeps explaining. Tris has joined with members of Dauntless who are now in pursuit of taking out the corporate oppressor a hard-faced Erudite named Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet leaning all the way in). Sensing a coup Jeanine needs to open a mysterious box that she believes will restore order. But only a Divergent can unlock it and this can be done only by luring one in and jacking into her nervous system. Six human lab rats have died trying. But Jeanine deduces that Tris is The One and must be captured. Costumes are supposed to help tell whos who. The gang over at Amity for instance all seem like cashiers at an Amish food market outfitted all in dark synthetic-looking fabrics and a cheery demeanor; Dauntless looks ready for Mad Max Turn Off the Dark. But everything about these movies seems substandard. The effects are probably state-of-the-art. They just dont look that way. (All 3-D ever enhances is a sense of cheapness.) In movies there are action sequences that defy physics and action sequences like the ones in Insurgent that defy coherence. Forced to open that box for Jeanine Tris must hang from coaxial cables while in a virtual world she swings on metal rods and crashes into rubble and fire. Its painfully off-brand sci-fi The Nay-trix. Through it all Triss macho-emo Dauntless boyfriend Four (Theo James) comes to her rescue. (Every time someone says his name I hear a baby trying to say ""Thor."") When Divergent opened last year I joined the chorus of yawners who complained of Roths intellectual opportunism -- you think George Orwell; you think The Hunger Games; you think ""Somebody call a lawyer."" Naturally that holds for Part 2. Roth pilfers but fails to dramatize and so the movies (Brian Duffield Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback are Insurgents credited screenwriters; Robert Schwentke directed) have no higher idea to point toward not one that aroused any excitement for the remaining two installments. It should help that head-turning actors keep turning up -- Octavia Spencer Janet McTeer Daniel Dae Kim and Naomi Watts are new; Miles Teller Ansel Elgort Zoe Kravitz Mekhi Phifer Maggie Q and Ashley Judd are not. But they show up to advance more of the plot. No one has anything to play. Not only does the movie have no real drama it lacks an emotional center like the one Jennifer Lawrence supplies for The Hunger Games. You miss the a la carte funk and spunk that Elizabeth Banks and Jena Malone give to those movies and the seasoning Donald Sutherland passes along. Insurgent too easily reverts to violence -- and in a neutralizing manner too. Ive never shrugged at this many massacres suicide attempts and point-blank murders. Its startling how not startling all of the grisliness is. This leaves Woodley with only conventional displays of toughness head smashing gun toting glass shattering none of which she executes with any conviction. She has no rousing speeches or memorable lines just haircuts marksmanship agility and tears all of which sound like the very last thing these movies need more factions.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Mar 20 2015 Culture Sometimes a movie is so manifestly ill-conceived that the best one can do is throw up ones hands in surrender and acknowledge the truth It is impossible to indict this film as thoroughly as it indicts itself.Ive gone down this road a handful of times before. M. Night Shyamalans The Happening and Jason Reitmans Labor Day (career lows for both directors) demanded straightforward recapitulations. The Words (starring Bradley Cooper) required a run-on sentence and Broken City (Mark Wahlberg) an actual diagram. Then along came Luc Bessons Lucy starring Scarlett Johannson which in many ways put all the rest to shame.Related Story Lucy The Dumbest Movie Ever Made About Brain Capacity And so with another awful cinematic experience--Sean Penns new vanity project The Gunman--comes another prophylactic spoilereview. In brief the movie is a dull generic retread of nearly every action movie youve ever seen with the reluctant super-soldier haunted by his past and enmeshed in a conspiracy etc. etc. But its made far worse by Penns self-seriousness as an actor by the banal and insulting political pieties that hes grafted on as producer and co-writer and by the presence of perhaps the most pitifully retrograde female lead role to appear onscreen in the past two decades.If in spite of these deficiencies you think you may still want to watch the film I recommend that you stop reading now because the spoilers are about to begin. As before the intent here is to offer an alternative to seeing the film at all. This may take a while but it will be shorter than the movie itself as well as less expensive and with luck moderately more entertaining. Onward.1. Before the screening I attended began there was a brief in-person demonstration by a local mixed martial arts club. Illustrating a defensive jujitsu move to be used against an assailant with a pistol one of the instructors explained ""Its easier to get out of the way of the bullet when its still in the gun."" This was literally the best line of dialogue I would hear all night.2. The director of The Gunman is Pierre Morel who also directed Liam Neesons surprise 2008 hit Taken. This has led virtually everyone alive to note that Penn was hoping this movie would be his Taken which is true enough. But Morel aside it could as easily have been Penns RED or The Expendables or November Man or The Book of Eli or Escape Plan or any of a dozen other examples. Mid-budget action movies--i.e. ones not laden with CGI--have been dominated by middle-agers for a good while now. The reason is simple as one executive explained to Vulture two years and countless ""geri-action"" releases ago When it comes to stars ""foreign buyers buy yesterday. They dont buy tomorrow.""3. But on to the movie itself. It begins grimly in the Democratic Republic of Congo or DRC in 2006. As images of atrocities and starving babies flash across the screen newscasters trade political shorthand ""worlds deadliest conflict"" ""private security contractors"" ""vast mineral wealth"" ""to meet the growing demand of the Western world."" Did I mention that Penn co-wrote the screenplay? The vague (okay not always that vague) whiff of sanctimony that accompanies almost everything he does is in the air from the opening credits on.The vague whiff of sanctimony that accompanies everything Penn does is in the air from the opening credits.4. Penns character Jim Terrier--and yes I believe this name was spit out by some action-hero algorithm--enters a cantina where his beautiful girlfriend Annie (Jasmine Trinca) is waiting. She is an aid worker at a local clinic; hes a security contractor. When she sets eyes on him she lights up as if she just saw all the puppies in the world gamboling together. (She will do this a lot.) My notes read SHE IS CLEARLY GOING TO DIE.5. Also in the bar is a colleague of theirs named Felix whos played by someone who looks identical to Javier Bardem but somehow seems to lack any of his talent. He drools when he looks at Annie and grimaces when he sees how she looks at Jim. This will end badly.5. Theres an operation set to take place in Kinshasa the assassination of a government minister. Felix who is the go-between with the shadowy client says the shooter will have to leave the country immediately after the killing. Jim turns out to be the shooter. See what Felix did there? Very clever. I cross out what I wrote before and write SHE IS CLEARLY GOING TO END UP WITH BARDEM.6. Jim shoots the minister and leaves the country. Flash forward eight years. Jim is back in the DRC but now he works for an aid group providing safe drinking water. This is how we know that despite having had no evident compunction about murdering a foreign leader in cold blood at heart hes really a good guy.7. We now interrupt this geopolitical action film to showcase a brief sequence of Sean Penn surfing off the Congolese coast. Really. There are so many Jeff Spicoli jokes competing for space in my head right now that they have somehow cancelled each other out. (Sorry.) But we do get to see how ridiculously buff Penn has gotten for this role. So theres that.8. Back at work Jim has headaches when he remembers the ministers assassination so we know he feels really bad about it. Later while hes digging a well a squad of paramilitary thugs shows up asking ""Where is the white man?"" They attack Jim and he kills most of them before being saved at the last second by his young assistant. Unless Im mistaken said assistant is the only African in the movie to have any spoken lines other than ""Where is the white man?"" And even he only has about three. We never see him again after this scene.9. Jim goes to London to find out whos trying to kill him. He assumes the plot must be connected to the DRC assassination eight years earlier. (Spoiler It is.) He meets with two old colleagues Terry (Mark Rylance) is now a rich executive at the security firm where they both used to work; Stanley (Ray Winstone) still looks like a beach bum. Its immediately clear that one of these characters will turn out to be the Secret Villain and the other the Loyal Friend. Im guessing Terry will be the former because hes rich and Sean Penn notionally dislikes rich people despite being one himself. But perhaps well be surprised.Jesus Penn is ripped. His biceps look like a medical condition.10. Jim goes to a pub with Stanley. Hes wearing a T-shirt. (Jesus Penn is ripped. His biceps look like a medical condition with Jackmanesque veins that seem ready to slither off his body altogether.) Jim gets into a pointless fight with soccer fans and then has another terrible headache with double vision and vomiting. Stanley takes him to the doctor.11. After conducting a brain scan the doctor says Jim might have early onset Alzheimers. But then everyone remembers that was the illness in Julianne Moores movie last year. So they conclude instead that he has ""post-concussion syndrome"" from all his years of fighting wars. Smart right? A topical ailment--with ties to the NFL controversy--that no one has yet played in a major motion picture. Its perfect. Were now officially an issue movie. This will be your I Am Sam Penn (Oh wait. I Am Sam was your I Am Sam. Forget I brought it up.)12. The doctor tells Jim ""Avoid anything strenuous to your head."" This is what is called ironic foreshadowing. Or it would be if the movie didnt completely forget about Jims head trauma for the next hour or so of very head-unfriendly activity. Were no longer officially an issue movie.13. Having learned that Felix--who may have information about the plot against him--is living in Barcelona Jim tells Stanley ""I gotta go Stan. Do you hear me? I gotta go."" Theres a lot of dialogue like this in the movie.14. Jim goes to Barcelona where he is surprised (unlike anyone in the audience) to discover that Felix and Annie are now married. Maybe Jim doesnt have Facebook. In any case he takes it very badly. He follows the now-rich Felix to a business conference and while Felix is taking part in a panel discussion he heckles him from the audience shouting about ""money."" Afterward he lectures him ""Not all of us tried to turn our sins into profit"" and ""I was drilling wells."" This tedious subtheme might be more persuasive if there hadnt already been so much real-world talk about how the studio hopes The Gunman will launch a wildly lucrative franchise a la Taken. (Spoiler It wont.)15. Felix accuses Jim of having come to Barcelona to try to steal Annie back. But he nonetheless suggests they all get together for dinner at a swanky restaurant at 10 p.m. Ah Europe.16. It turns out that Felix is testing Annies faithfulness by not telling her that Jim is in town and coming to dinner. When Jim shows up at the restaurant a surprised Annie eye-rapes him for what seems like ten minutes. Felix looks at her radioactive lust-face with manifest disgust. Jim looks upon Felixs disgust with outright contempt. I honestly dont think Ive ever seen an actual human being make any of the mime/kabuki expressions on display in this scene. Annie says ""Youre humiliating me."" Felix says ""The way you stare at him humiliates you."" Annie flees the restaurant and Jim says to Felix ""You proud of yourself?"" Burn.I dont think Ive ever seen an actual human face make any of the expressions on display in this scene.17. Jim goes back to his hotel room. Theres a knock on the door. Its Annie. She comes in and immediately proceeds to have passionate adultery with him. Afterward she tells him that she has never loved Felix but was grateful to him for protecting her after Jim abandoned them in the DRC. ""I tried to pay the debt with marriage"" she says. ""Im still paying. Hes still collecting."" (Not to make an obvious observation Annie but the whole point of marriage is that its not supposed to be a temporary arrangement.) Then she tells Jim that the reason she came to his room was because Felix sent her. He may have information about who it was who tried to have Jim killed. She tells Jim to come to their country house for lunch the next day.17a. Just in case you missed it--or more likely refused to believe it--let me relate that sequence one more time. Felix tells Jim he thinks hes trying to steal Annie. Then at dinner he berates Annie for ostentatiously ogling Jim. And then he sends Annie to Jims hotel room where the two of them do in fact have sex. At what point in the writers minds did any of this make sense? Plus now everyone has to have the worlds most awkward lunch at the country house.18. When Jim arrives there the next day Felix is cartoonishly drunk stumbling around and shouting at him ""Peekaboo Romeo Romeo Romeo."" When Annie comes back from riding horses Felix tells her to shower--because you know she also had sex with Jim last night. Jim tries to find out what Felix knows about his attempted killers but Felix basically ignores him because hes having so much fun with what is devolving into an improvisational one-man rendition of Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?.19. It turns out (surprise) that Felix is in league with the people trying to kill Jim. Hed invited Jim to the country house to find out whether he had any evidence that would connect his old company to the assassination in the DRC. Unfortunately Felix is no condition to grill Jim having already gotten extravagantly drunk in a way that no person would ever get under such lethal circumstances no matter how jealous he was. Felix gets in touch with his cohorts who send murderous bad guys to the house. They kill the now-a-liability Felix and thank God for that. Of all the reasons for you not to see this film perhaps the best one is that Javier Bardems reputation surely wants very much for you not to see it.20. The bad guys try to kill Jim and Annie. Jim kills them instead. Annie screams. A lot. It is by this point in the film clear that Annies character has precisely three purposes in the film to stare at Jim in exorbitant awe adoration and/or lust; to scream until he saves her; and to get up every morning wearing a mans oxford shirt and no pants as if she just walked out of a 1980s Van Heusen commercial. (Do not skip that link. Trust me.) The character is an affront to pretty much every woman alive. Its notable too that despite having far more screen time than anyone other than Penn Trinca is billed below all her other male co-stars.21. As it happens Jim has been holding onto evidence of the companys complicity in the DRC murder and he needs to go back to his hotel in Barcelona to retrieve it. So he sneaks in gets the information and notices theres a booby trap in the room and goons watching from across the street. But rather than just leave the way he came he lures said goons to the room so that he can ostentatiously kill them with the booby trap. Im sure that there are ways to reconcile a movie about a man who is deeply remorseful for past killings with a movie that delights in showing how gifted he is at killing new folks. This isnt it.22. Laying his heavy head on Annies shoulder in the car Jim tells her to ""just drive until you cant drive anymore."" They go to a house where his friend Stanley is staying and Stanley tells him that he might get useful information about who is masterminding the attempts on his life from the company office in Gibraltar. In the middle of the night while Annie is asleep in bed--its better this way to avoid a tearful scene--Jim once again leaves her because he loves her too much to involve her any further. Of course given that by now the bad guys know all about Annies involvement this is entirely stupid. But how else will she wind up being taken hostage in time for the movies final act?23. Jim travels to Gibraltar were he squints committedly in the sunlight as if hes auditioning for a role in a Sergio Leone film. Eventually he encounters an Interpol agent (Idris Elba in what despite his prominent billing is barely a cameo) who delivers a powerfully tedious monologue about building treehouses. (Its a metaphor you see.) Jim also sees Terry his old wildly successful colleague from the security firm and it turns out that--wait for it--Terrys the Secret Villain pulling all the strings to get Jim killed and scruffy Stanley is the Loyal Friend after all. During a showdown Terry sneers at Jim that Annie is ""damaged goods"" because she was repeatedly raped in the DRC after Jim left--a thoroughly unpleasant nugget weve never heard about before and will never hear about again. Jims brain-trauma headaches recur (remember them? The last several action sequences didnt) and he barely escapes to pass out on the street between two dumpsters. Luckily the crack global security firm hot on his heels that desperately wants to kill him doesnt think to look between the dumpsters.Hes taken both hostage as recommended in the handbook Villainy For Idiots. 24. Terry calls Jims cell phone. Hes taken both Stanley and Annie hostage as recommended in the invaluable handbook Villainy For Idiots. While Jim listens Terry shoots Stanley in the face because thats what Secret Villains do to Loyal Friends. He also threatens to kill Annie unless Jim brings all his evidence against the company to a bullfight in Barcelona. Because you know Spain. (Here I feel obligated to point out that bullfighting has in fact been outlawed in Barcelona since 2012.)25. A brief step back before we conclude to note that the principal purpose of every single character in this film is to illuminate Jims (that is Sean Penns) wonderfulness. Scruffy roly-poly Stanley loved him enough to die for him. Terry and Felix both betrayed him utterly and trashed the love of his life. Annie as weve discussed is simultaneously the Good Woman whose love redeems his bad acts (she works in a clinic in the DRC etc.) and also the moth so drawn to his mad-lover flame that she cheats on her husband after approximately 4.3 seconds in Jims presence. And against all reason Elbas Interpol agent seems to consider Jim an ally rather than--given that hes the man who pulled the trigger in a political assassination--a principal conspirator and target of his investigation.26. Penns character itself is if anything worse. Usually a star performance this self-loving (Braveheart Dances With Wolves The Prince of Tides) is self-directed but Penn has gone the writing/producing route instead. The end result is pretty much the same. Like Mel Gibsons William Wallace Penns Jim Terrier is an amalgam of incompatible virtues the Tragic Loner and the Loyal Lover; the Haunted Killer and the Inexorable Killer; the Doomed Sinner and the Last Honest Man. Plus when hes doing his day job the Great White Savior.27. So now were at the bullfight where Terry will trade Annie for all the evidence Jim may have against the company. Much silliness takes place (including of course the obvious fact that Jim could have infinite copies of his evidence stashed anywhere). A couple of baddies are sent out into the stands and backlots of the arena to take Jim out. And though he deals with them his long-forgotten brain issue is becoming ever more debilitating. In one scene a staggering Jim is visually compared to the bull in the arena proud primal doomed. In another Terry absurdly chases Annie through the crowded stadium brandishing a pistol and no one seems to care.28. Finally it comes down to Jim Annie and Terry. There is a long scene with another huge angry bull. The various gates to its pen are opened and closed repeatedly. Will the bull charge? Who will it kill? It does charge and at the very last instant Annie is lifted to safety. The bull runs beneath her and on into Terry whom it gores graphically repeatedly and fatally. If I ever feel I need a PSA to teach my children not to play with bulls this scene is what Ill use.29. Jim awakes in the hospital. Elbas Interpol agent is there and Jim agrees to hand over all his information on the DRC assassination and cooperate with the investigation. Elba cautions him that he will still have to do considerable time which seems fair given that Jim was himself the assassin. Annie looks on adoringly because thats why shes there.30. But wait Its the final scene. Annie is back in Africa surrounded by poor black people who need her help. Will Jim one day be able to rejoin her to perform the good work (and expert sexual gratification) of which we all know hes capable? He will. Today in fact. With no sign that any meaningful time has elapsed--certainly not the years of prison that he presumably ought to have served--Jim strides in and embraces Annie. Everyone is happy especially the poor Africans brought in by the props department none of whom have any lines or even names. I however have developed a terrible headache. Could it be post-concussion syndrome? Probably not. But I hear its a thing these days.

Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Backed by a mostly wasted cast that includes Javier Bardem and Ray Winstone Penn plays a reformed ex-special forces military operative and international hit man attempting to shake off a squad of assassins who eight years after some nasty doings in Congo are heatedly pursuing him. Penns character is named Jim Terrier which should give you some idea of this films subtlety quotient. I doubt ""The Gunman"" will do much to advance Penns foray into action-hero bankability and thats probably a good thing. Hes too fine an actor to be mired in nonstop shootouts while flashing his pecs and looking scowly. Grade C (Rated R for strong violence language and some sexuality.)

You know whats really pretty clear? These people dont go to action pictures. Those are films that usually revolve around American vigilantism - often against swarthy foreigners. Hell ""Kingsman"" even cast Obama as a genocidal traitor. Yes the moguls like their liberal politics. But they like money more and if theres any profit in a rah-rah revenge movie they will happily take a sharp turn right. Well ""The Gunman"" turns left. Thats not surprising perhaps - it stars the proudly radical Sean Penn who also co-produced and co-wrote. But it is a different kind of action movie in which the good guy is actually a bad guy - an American ""international security expert"" whos really an assassin. And who then nearly a decade after he got out of the business becomes someone elses target. You can see what interested Penn in the project besides the paycheck - the movie has Americas corporate/government villains knocking off Third World socialists to help protect profits. Its like a double-issue of Mother Jones but with gunfights. But those gunfights - courtesy of Pierre Morel the Luc Besson protegee who did the great ""District B13"" and then reinvented Liam Neeson as an action star with ""Taken"" - are terrifically well-staged. Well-choreographed too. In a genre which too often relies on fast cutting to cover up for its slowing stars ""The Gunman"" handles things cleanly and crisply particularly in a hand-to-hand knifefight Penn has with one of the men out to get him. Why are they out to get him? Thats a bit muddled in a movie that occasionally loses the thread - or takes cheap shortcuts. Penns character for example is literally brain-damaged - but the symptoms only seem to occur when its necessary to let the villain get away. This isnt just awfully lazy writing - its actually offensive. Post-combat head trauma used as an easy plot device? Charming. The actors though are all fine. Penn - still clearly the surfer dude hes been since high school - is fit as his many shirtless scenes point out (although those popping veins do look a little steroidal). Javier Bardem and the marvelous Mark Rylance class up the place as two of his former mercenary pals - one guilt-ridden one not. Its also an immense pleasure to see Ray Winstone one of the few actors who just exudes cheerful menace -- although Jasmine Trinca as Penns former love doesnt get to do much except get rescued. (This may be a leftist movie but in no way is it feminist.) In fact for all its radical politics ""The Gunman"" is artistically very conservative. Penn is consistently outnumbered three-to-one four-to-one six-to-one - and wins every time. All the foreign-shot scenes make sure to get a picture-postcard landmark front-and-center and the ending is both happy and absurdly improbable. But the actors are good and the action is thrilling. And if the film isnt quite as seriously political as Im guessing Penn told himself it was its definitely an offbeat change of pace for us. Ratings note The film contains strong language and graphic violence. The Gunman (R) Open Road (115 min.) Directed by Pierre Morel. With Sean Penn Javier Bardem Ray Winstone Mark Rylance.

Eight years later Jim back in Congo as a repentant aid worker finds himself the target of a hired killing attempt and sets out to find who betrayed him. The remainder of the film sees Jim flying driving and shooting his way through scenic European locations while meeting with shadowy men (Ray Winstone Mark Rylance Idris Elba). Jim also enjoys a lusty reunion with Annie (now married to Felix) before a car chase and an extended showdown during a bullfight.To complicate things Jim suffers from a degenerative brain condition which makes The Gunman play like a queasy blend of Still Alice and The Bourne Identity.

The Gunman Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2015) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-gunman-2015,200,thegunman6,thegunman,rogerebert
"Review The Gunman misses the target - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview The Gunman misses the targetBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 03/19/2015 110152 AM PDTUpdated 03/19/2015 110224 AM PDT It stands to reason that if someone tries recasting Sean Penn as a middle-aged action hero -- a la Liam Neeson -- they should do it with a smart film. Penn isnt the type to throw around one-liners before his character blows someone through a wall.Unfortunately ""The Gunman"" isnt as smart as it needs to be which is a missed opportunity. Casting Penn as an aging professional killer whose past comes back to bite him seems an idea that is past due. Penn hasnt headlined an action thriller before and the thought of him applying his skills and intensity to such a role is an exciting one. But concepts and results sometimes dont wind up on the same page.The fault isnt Penns as much as it is a weak plot and the tendency of director Pierre Morel (""Taken"") to allow the film to fall back on subplots exhausted by other spy thrillers. Penn does his job for the most part. His lined face ripped physique and leathery skin reveal a dangerous professional whos been to hell and back. This is no smooth-faced handsome Matt Damon playing Jason Bourne. Penn also has enough skill to give his character some depth and humor and us some reasons to like him.So ""The Gunman"" is enjoyable at times. But too many problems keep it from being a very good film.Advertisement Penn is retired assassin James Terrier dealing with a world that mixes corporate motivations with political interests. Its refreshing in its complexity especially when -- like in the real world -- were not quite sure who at the top is doing what to whom. And setting much of the movie in a brutal environment of the Congo provides a necessary grittiness.Posing as aid workers Terrier and Felix (Javier Bardem) are part of a mercenary team that pulls off a world-stunning political assassination for a shadow employer. Because Terrier is chosen to take the shot he must immediately flee the country leaving behind his lover the almost too-perfect humanitarian doctor Annie (Jasmine Trinca). Fast forward eight years and Terrier is back in Africa though now apparently a real aid worker. When someone tries to kill him he goes to Europe and tracks down some of his old mercenary buddies to get to the bottom of it.Heres where the film develops its warts. Since Terrier asks Felix to take care of Annie we have to endure watching a smart passionate woman who needs baby-sitting and falls in love with whichever man pays most attention to her. She mostly exists to give the men someone to rescue and she remains as unquestioning as an unknowing child while being ripped away from her life. The action scenes are mostly well done paced so the audience can appreciate what happens unlike so many other films in the genre that move as fast as possible because they can. Even having the big showdown during a bullfight in Spain -- which at first seems cliched and obvious -- works pretty well. Sean Penn as Jim Terrier in The Gunman. (Joe Alblas) ( Joe Alblas ) But Bardems character is a letdown. Too much of what Felix does happens too easily from his relationship with Annie to his rise as a businessman despite being a drunk. Instead of playing a complicated and worthy foe for Terrier Felix comes off like a dopey passive-aggressive kid. ""The Gunman"" starts well presenting an opportunity for a conversation or two about how governments and corporations manipulate Third World countries. But it devolves into a mess of worn plot lines. If Morel wanted to give Penns career new life as a world-weary action hero he missed his target.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.The Gunman   Rating R (strong violence language some sexualityCast Sean Penn Javier Bardem Jasmine Trinca Idris ElbaDirector Pierre MorelRunning time 1 hour 55 minutes Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES A Game of Thrones spin-off?

"Review The Gunman with Sean Penn a misfire that wastes strong cast - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Gunman with Sean Penn a misfire that wastes strong cast The Gunman Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews The Guman Starring Sean Penn Idris Elba and Javier Bardem. Betsy Sharkey reviews The Guman Starring Sean Penn Idris Elba and Javier Bardem. Betsy Sharkey Review The Gunman with Sean Penn Javier Bardem is a dud of an action film about a sniper and ex-colleagues At one point in ""The Gunman"" a pack of well-armed assassins is in hot pursuit of Sean Penns sniper and his beautiful distressed damsel when suddenly she stops refusing to go one step farther until he explains what the heck is going on.My sentiments exactly. Part of the contract that movies of this sort forge with moviegoers is that the reasons for all the running and gunning wont get in the way of the action. ""The Gunman"" doesnt play by those rules.Instead of a pot-boiling crime noir like the one that exists in the pages of the late French novelist Jean-Patrick Manchettes ""The Prone Gunman"" (which sounds better in French) the adaptation is a frustrating fiasco that kills the material and squanders its exceedingly fine cast. Penn who lets face it is the films drawing card is buffed up and in almost every scene. Yet his character never quite comes to life or at least not in the ways we expect from the actor.The movies misfire comes as something of a surprise since Pierre Morel who directed ""Taken"" is in charge. ""Takens"" success in part lies in its simplicity -- daughters kidnapping makes ex-black ops dad crazy mad and launches him into full action mode for the rescue. In ""Gunman"" confusion reigns. Worse you can sense the overreaching for contemporary relevance in the screenplay by Don MacPherson Pete Travis and Penn. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link The film starts in the Congo where the mineral-rich country is being strip-mined by international conglomerates while guerrilla warfare between the countrys factions is leaving a trail of blood.Jim Terrier (Penn) is among a team of mercenaries hired to protect the mining operations and keep an eye on humanitarian efforts which includes the beautiful aid worker Annie (Jasmine Trinca) who is his lover. Felix (Javier Bardem) also smitten with her has the power to put Terrier in the line of fire and in short order he does. Trailer The Gunman Watch the trailer for ""The Gunman."" Watch the trailer for ""The Gunman."" See more videos Terrier is assigned to take a kill shot of a key political leader that causes even more chaos in the country and sends him on the run leaving Annie to Felix. Nearly a decade later hes doing penance by helping install wells in the region to ensure villages have fresh water when that shot comes back to haunt him.It comes in the form of an attempt on Terriers life and sends him first to London to connect with some of his old running buddies. Terriers blinding headaches get diagnosed -- suffice it to say the news from the doctor is not good -- then its on to Barcelona Spain where Felix heads a highly lucrative nonprofit and Annie becomes his wife.Indeed everyone besides Terrier and one old colleague Stanley (Ray Winstone) is now a sporting designer suit and operating out of a high-rise. Theyre all still dirty just paying someone else to do the work.The rest of the film hangs on the balance of power between the good bad guys -- that would be Terrier and Stanley -- and bad bad guys -- Felix a guy named Cox (Mark Rylance) and nearly everybody else.Almost from the start of the film we get glimpses of Idris Elba. Hes well dressed too. But it is so late in the film before his potentially pivotal role begins to take shape you wonder why they bother.Penn can be a magnetic force field in any type of role and he has an impressive history in action. Consider ""Mystic River"" which brought the actor his first Oscar in 2004. That drama also examined the ripple effect of crime with Penns performance so enigmatic you can barely breathe. ""The Falcon amp; the Snowman"" was another a thriller with political implications in which the actors descent into drugs and deception is riveting.He brings some of that energy and intensity to ""The Gunman"" but the interior life of a man trying to remake his fate remains in the dark.The production value is high the various global hot spots make an interesting canvas used well by cinematographer Flavio Martinez Labiano. Bardem Elba Winstone and Rylance major talents all do what they can with what they have. Trinca is a good opposite number for Penn the chemistry is definitely there.But the maze in which theyve been dropped has too many dead ends. And the decision to end things in a bullring seems apt. By that point there has been no shortage of bull.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com------------The GunmanMPAA rating R for strong violence language and some sexualityRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Sean Penn Javier Bardem Ray Winstone Pierre Morel Reviews Kumiko the Treasure Hunter chases her Fargo dream Insurgent smartly gives the Divergent Tris room to run Kumiko the Treasure Hunter chases her Fargo dream Insurgent could kick off with as much as 60 million Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-gunman-review-20150320-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,thegunman8,thegunman,latimes
"Gunman The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; gunman-the ) Gunman The (Spain/UK/France 2015) March 21 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli If I was in the mood for an over-the-hill action hero I think Id go with Schwarzenegger. Or maybe Stallone. Or even Liam Neeson. I definitely wouldnt pick Sean Penn. Granted the two-time Oscar winner has an impressive resume but hes not the kind of actor you associate with the guilty pleasure represented by a 2015 action film. His work in The Gunman does nothing to disprove the assumption. Penn is dour and not the least bit heroic in this movie. He survives the action sequences but neither they nor his participation in them gets the blood pumping. And the movie wallows in remorse. Not only is the main character paralyzed by it but the filmmakers seem to believe that every Caucasian member of the audience should face up to White Guilt for the way in which the Industrial World has encouraged unrest in Africa so resources could be strip-mined. Hows that for an uplifting action movie premise? Still there are grim thrillers that work on their own terms. For example First Blood wasnt a barrel of laughs. The problems with The Gunman relate less to its political backstory that the lackluster narrative and generic action scenes. This is a talky movie; it takes forever to explain whats going on and even longer to get into the meat of the story. How many times did I check my watch during the first half-hour? Once were there the film makes little effort to get us to care about the characters. Most are only around for a few scenes. Respected actors like Idris Elba and Ray Winstone have less than seven minutes of screen time each. Javier Bardem fares a little better (although not much) but his character of Felix spends the entirety of his appearance drunk and/or engorged with jealousy. The person with the second-most time in front of the camera is Jasmine Trinca who plays Annie a distressingly traditional damsel-in-distress. Penn meanwhile trudges through the movie like hes too good for the material. The action transpires in the war-torn Congo where in 2006 assassin Jim Terrier (Penn) canoodles with Annie the love of his life before going out with his gang to kill the Minister of Mining whos making life difficult for the corporation signing Jims paycheck. After an eight year separation from Annie made necessary by his status as an international fugitive Jim finds his way back to her only to learn that his ex-employers are looking to whitewash their past by eliminating those who did unsavory work for them. So Jim and Annie end up on the run in Barcelona avoiding hit men and assorted thugs while trying to find a way out of a situation with no apparent escape hatch - until the arrival of the treehouse-builder from Interpol that is. In between long convoluted conversations there are some action scenes. In one Penn faces off against a group of machete-wielding attackers who are intent upon disturbing his humanitarian efforts. Later he and Annie are cornered by a cadre of well-armed home invaders who do just enough stupid things to let their quarry get away (they find that when you play with fire you get burned). The finale features a rampaging bull with no china shop in sight. Generally speaking the action scenes are competently filmed but they lack energy and urgency. Theyre obligatory ""Quick maybe the audience is about to fall asleep - lets shoot and machete a few people to wake them up"" The Gunmans director is Pierre Morel the former cinematographer who transformed Liam Neeson from a respected thespian into a kick-ass action hero in Taken. The career boost has allowed Neeson to continue to make ""prestige"" films while fattening his bank account with popcorn roles. Morel apparently saw an opportunity for lightning to strike again but although Penn has more Academy Awards than Neeson (two to zero) he lacks the bigger mans charisma. Its tough to say whether Penn might have been able to achieve the transition with a script less determined to alienate as much of the audience as possible but The Gunman is definitely not the right vehicle.

Penn even worked with the director of Taken Pierre Morel to create The Gunman the high-body-count story of a regretful mercenary who finds himself the target of scores of revenge-seeking assassins. The whole enterprise practically screams ""Make me more marketable"" The difference is that the affable Neeson has tons of personal goodwill he could use as currency when the day came to cash in. But theres a sourness to Penn that informs his character Jim Terrier (ahem) that makes him hard to root for. There is about 10 minutes of The Gunman that may fool the viewer into thinking that Penn found a way to meld the geopolitics in which he indulges in real life (refugee issues NGOs) with an action plot. Mobile users click this link The Gunman ostensibly opens in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where Jim is operating under the cover of security for an aid project (and is carrying on an affair with an aid worker named Annie played by Jasmine Trinca wholl be with us the rest of the movie in the role of ""the girl""). Hes really there however on the payroll of a multinational oil company one that has no qualms about ordering the assassination of African politicians in their way. And hes working for a complete d--- played by Javier Bardem (Im starting to think this is the only role he can get anymore). One political killing and years of civil unrest with thousands of casualties later Jim is back in the Congo this time trying to do some good. (Bear in mind later in the movie that Jim is that countrys equivalent of Lee Harvey Oswald but everyone beams happily at the sight of him). And then comes an out-of-the-blue attack by stealth killers whom the unarmed Jim easily dispatches before fleeing the country. Goodbye Africa. Like an erratic discount vacation plagued by hailstorms of bullets The Gunman changes scenery abruptly as if to stave off boredom. In London Jim escapes another attempt on his life hooks up with his old mercenary drinking buddy Stanley (Ray Winstone) and is diagnosed with the same concussion syndrome ex-football players get. This is a rare form of the disease that manifests itself in dizzy spells that occur just when Jim is getting the upper hand on the bad guys too early in the film. So""| Spain Well its a chance for Bardems character to be a d--- in his own country for Jim to rescue Annie from Bardem and a horde of assassins and for the writers to set up a series of last act shoot-out/chase scenes at a bullfight in Barcelona (where bull-fighting is banned by the way). Penn looks the part at least having sculpted his fiftysomething body for the many shirt-less scenes he plays. He even gets to surf while in Africa. But a plot that makes no sense characters that are barely there (yes Idris Elba is high in the credits but he has only one scene to speak of) and a denouement that is an insult to everybodys intelligence all combine to make Penns action-man debut fire blanks.""

Keith Bernstein/Open Road Films hide caption toggle caption Keith Bernstein/Open Road Films Sean Penn as Jim Terrier in The Gunman. Keith Bernstein/Open Road Films In addition to being both a two-time Oscar winner and the director of the fantastic Into The Wild Sean Penn is also heavily involved in an assortment of humanitarian causes. The second bullet point more so than the first may explain Penns attraction to The Gunman a dum-dum action picture that briefly pretends to be about world aid before returning to muscular middle-aged men beating the snot out of each other. Hold on those muscles for a second; certainly director Pierre Morel does. His camera lovingly lingers over his stars impressive pecs at every opportunity including one scene where Penn jogs through a village at dawn clad only in a tight bathing suit. Morel surrounds him with several other good-looking gentlemen not just co-stars Javier Bardem and Idris Elba but the nameless hunky Spanish hit men gunning for Penns life. Theres exactly one woman on hand an old flame played by Italian beauty Jasmine Trinca but shes mostly in the way tossed between locations like a rag doll while the men admire each others deadliness. But some might care about the people all these muscles belong to so here goes The story opens in the Democratic Republic of Congo where Jim Terrier (Penn) is working as both security detail for an NGO -- thats nongovernmental organization -- and secret mercenary for an energy conglomerate that wants a Congolese minister dead. When the moment comes his aim strikes true meaning he has to abandon his true love and get out of Dodge. But nine years later hes back in the country working for an organization that has something to do with water wells (not much is clear about them apart from generic do-goodery indicating our antihero has reformed). When some gun-toting mercenaries arrive looking for ""the white man"" Jim suspects someones placed a bounty on his biceps. Jims detective process involves a series of steps apparently designed to make the audience lose interest in the movie. First he leaves the DRC so that he and his enemies can do the run-and-gun thing in London and Barcelona instead which seems counterproductive if the goal is to bring attention to conditions in the DRC. Then he tracks down his former partners in crime starting with the supremely talented Bardem whos doing a one-note caricature of a sniveling drunk. No one is cracking jokes by the way not even Ray Winstone as a sympathetic brother-in-arms. The final insult comes at the two-thirds mark when we remember we were promised Idris Elba and resign ourselves to the fact that someone with a far bigger fanbase than Penn will get only a glorified cameo. The Gunman is based on a 1981 thriller novel by Jean-Patrick Manchette. Any hints of subversion in this genre story -- the political immorality a suggestion that Jims paranoia is merely the result of severe head trauma -- are snuffed out with improbable gunplay and rote speechifying. Apropos of nothing the climax is held at a bullfighting ring. Perhaps someone will get gored? The first Taken also directed by Morel had a more extreme trajectory. After a genuinely terrifying first act it employed the action-movie conventions that turned star Liam Neeson into todays hottest middle-aged butt-kicker. The Gunman seems a clear attempt by Penn to follow in Neesons footsteps to box office gold with a sprinkle of Save The World to make everyone feel better. But it arrives only a week after Neesons latest shooter Run All Night flopped in ticket sales. Someone is going to have to change his tactics and it will take a lot more than ab workouts this time.

Its a globetrotting action-espionage thriller in the ""Bourne Identity"" vein shot in Africa Barcelona London and the bowels of an aquarium in Gibraltar (although to my great disappointment no one is thrown into the shark tank) and directed by Pierre Morel a Luc Besson protege who made the first ""Taken"" movie in 2008. It appears to have been constructed as a star vehicle for Sean Penn who is one of its producers. Without disputing either Penns filmmaking clout or his acting prowess this is a really weird choice even by his standards. Here we have a 54-year-old two-time Oscar winner a consummate actors actor who has played all kinds of parts in all kinds of films trying to blaze a new path as the second coming of Jason Statham or Vin Diesel.But Ill be damned if Penn doesnt pull it off although Im not sure the public is lining up to see the guy who played Harvey Milk transformed into a hard-body CIA assassin seeking redemption. (Do I sense a mashup in the making?) I genuinely dont want to know what kind of terrifying pharmaceutical and/or bodybuilding regimen was involved in reshaping Penns physique for this role as a reformed black-ops spook named Jim Terrier -- but OMG people With his clothes on the Penn of 2015 looks like a dead ringer for longtime NBA coach Pat Riley. But when he doffs the shirt dude is ripped. Theres a level of narrative confusion here that I guess befits a movie whose worldview and politics are so thoroughly addled On one hand Terrier is supposed to be a battered haunted killer suffering from memory loss and possible dementia after multiple head injuries; on the other hes an indestructible ass-kicking machine who repeatedly takes on teams of Special Forces-type guys and rips them apart.Ive pretty much always enjoyed watching Penn in everything not despite of his hambone tendency to milk every moment of every shot but because of it. This stupid movie is no exception and in the intervals between killings and explosions Penn brings such carved-stone gravity and depth of sadness to Jim that you almost believe his penitent-Christ shtick will atone for all the greed of capitalism and all the crimes of imperialism. As far as Im concerned Penns erratic personal life political grandstanding and undisguised loathing of the media come with the package; hes one of the last people left in Hollywood who embraces the full Brando tradition of stardom as a job that demands endless egotism and blatant obnoxiousness and who can back it up with actual talent.Making a Eurotrash eye-candy action thriller at Penns age was total folly no doubt but I honor the perversity and arrogance of the impulse. Sure he could be doing Eugene ONeill on stage or working with the Coens or doing weird European movies or whatever. (And he has Bizarre and almost unwatchable as Paolo Sorrentinos ""This Must Be the Place"" is Penn is unforgettable as an aging Goth-rock idol turned Nazi-hunter apparently modeled on Robert Smith of the Cure.) But why settle for delicacy and quality when the brass ring of vainglory is out there longing to be grasped? At the screening of ""The Gunman"" I attended several people were openly laughing at the movies grandiose sub-Hemingway macho-fantasy symbolism its woozy blend of hot girls hot cars and ""white people in hot weather"" locations. My reaction was different This movie is like drinking tequila for two hours. The first hour feels like the most fun youve ever had and then the second hour undoes that feeling and then some leaving you empty repentant and throbbing in pain on a concrete floor. You Might Also Like You could use ""The Gunman"" in film-studies courses to illustrate the value of the auteur theory (meaning the idea that the director is the primary author of a film) if only in a negative sense. Its clearly a directorial accomplishment to assemble this level of acting talent in one movie and come away with something so - well ""bad"" is not sufficient to capture the idiot glory of this motion picture. Something so sugarcoated and faux-meaningful and fraught with condescension and free of actual brain activity. Furthermore although ""The Gunman"" is in English and was largely shot in Spain and Britain Morel infuses it with a blend of grandeur and stupidity and exemplary artisanship that feels essentially French the same spirit embodied (with less pretense of social conscience) in the Palace of Versailles.While Penn is certainly the star this movie is an embarrassment of middle-aged masculine riches. Javier Bardem plays a drink-sodden duplicitous ex-colleague with bad clothes and a beautiful wife and Idris Elba plays to type as an upright Interpol agent. So weve got three of the most charismatic leading men of our age squaring off against each other before we even get to Mark Rylance and Ray Winstone two of the greatest living British actors (in completely different registers) as a pair of wised-up codgers who find themselves on opposite sides of the great spy-agency killing spree.Women - wait what are those again? Some sort of decorative element right? Basically the only one here is Italian actress Jasmine Trinca as the hot NGO aid-worker-type person whom Jim ditches in the Congo circa 2006 after one of his egregious ""assignments"" provokes an international crisis. Years pass and she marries Bardems El Corrupto character for his irresistible combo of ill-gotten money alcoholism and self-hatred. But if you think she has forgotten the hot American spy who lied to her dumped her and plunged Central Africa into chaos by killing on behalf of evil corporations you would be wrong. Jim shows up in Barcelona on the run from the usual shadowy conspiracy required by movies like this and she absolutely cannot wait to jump on top of him steal a cool 60s roadster and head out on an impulsive road trip that ends in abduction and torture. And a bullfight. Since were in Spain the action climax occurs at a bullfight. It may frame this bizarre inexcusable and occasionally delicious spectacle somewhat more clearly to observe that ""The Gunman"" is adapted from a 1981 novel by the legendary French crime writer Jean-Patrick Manchette a onetime 60s leftist shaped by existentialism and the noir aesthetic. Ive never read the book but Id be willing to bet that the aura of dated machismo is imported intact but that screenwriters Don MacPherson and Pete Travis have forcibly tried to twist a narrative of decay and decline into a conventional movie fable of heroism triumphant and order restored. The result is an unexpectedly dark and downbeat thriller that retreats from all its most mordant observations about the uses of power and violence into one of the most obviously fake happy endings ever stapled onto a motion picture. This is a movie that cannot remember that its central character suffers from brain damage and dementia. No doubt thats a metaphor for something but the disorder is contagious so Im not sure what.

"The Gunmans Sean Penn is pumped but the movie fires blanks review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Gunmans Sean Penn is pumped but the movie fires blanks reviewWhatever else we might think of Sean Penns bid for an active middle age via The Gunman we cant doubt his enthusiasm.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 19 2015The Gunman Starring Sean Penn Javier Bardem Jasmine Trinca Ray Winstone Idris Elba and Mark Rylance. Directed by Pierre Morel. At GTA theatres. 115 minutes. 14AWhatever else we might think of Sean Penns bid for an active middle age via The Gunman we cant doubt his enthusiasm.The man looks positively ripped at 54 with abs as tight as his grimace indicating hes likely spent more time in the gym in recent times than in most of his decades of hard smoking. If this action hero thing doesnt work out for him he could always apply to be in the next Magic Mike sequel.Article Continued BelowThis might make more sense than The Gunman a muddled espionage thriller squeezed from the pulp of a long-forgotten French novel with Takens Pierre Morel at the helm. Taken and Morel lest we forget were responsible for Liam Neesons profitable macho makeover a fact that has not escaped fellow mid-lifer Penn who also takes producing and co-writing credits. Sean Penn is nothing if not in shape as Jim Terrier in The Gunman.The casting is as pumped as Penn who has been MIA from the box-office hit parade of late. Helping him shoulder the dramatic load are such estimable thespians as Javier Bardem Idris Elba Ray Winstone and Mark Rylance (BBCs Wolf Hall). Italys Jasmine Trinca 33 assumes the de rigueur and thankless role of Penns younger lover.So with all this going for Penn not to mention a willingness to doff his shirt at every turn what happened to The Gunman? Bad writing in the main although he and Morel do their level best to turn pulp into gold and occasionally shows signs of the action movie that could have been.This one begins in 2006 murkily introducing Penns dogged Jim Terrier (yes really) as a humourless ex-Special Forces soldier handling security for a dubious mining firm in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Jim moonlights as a political assassin for generic shadowy interests more out of boredom than ideology one suspects.Jim is madly in love with humanitarian aid doctor Annie (Trinca) and vice-versa. They barely have time to make the mattress groan before Jim is tasked as ""designated trigger"" in a plot against the DRCs mines minister a gig that requires him to flee both the country and his gal pal. As he splits he tells fellow black ops guy Felix (Bardem) to look after Annie for him.Jump ahead eight years and Jim is back in Africa as if nothing happened surfing dangerous waves both literal and metaphorical. Hes also turned humanitarian -- shades of Penns commendable Haiti earthquake relief work -- but it seems somebody remembers his dark past all too well. As Jim drills a well for the needy a hit squad attempts to drill him sending him into full action-man mode and on an international hunt for answers. His quest and also production tax credits will take him to London where hell reconnect with other midnight mates Cox (Rylance) a fellow Congo plotter turned corporate profiteer; and Stanley (Winstone) a longtime pal with whom Jim has had too many escapades and booze-ups to mention but theyll attempt to do so anyway.The abundantly funded passported and armed Jim also treks to Barcelona wherein he learns that Felix now fabulously wealthy has been taking all too good care of Annie much to Jims belated chagrin.Theres a side trip to Gibraltar where Jim catches up on a plot twist attentive viewers have already long sussed followed by a long action sequence back in Barcelona at a bullfight because well Spain. Amiright amigo?Elba enters the scene in a loopy exchange with Penn that will go down in the annals of bad screenwriting as ""the tree house speech.""The turns of events are dizzying with visuals smoothly handled by Morel a former full-time cinematographer who did a lot of his own lensing.But this is also alas standard-issue spy stuff the kind where plot epiphanies happen on the run bullets have predictable trajectories and to-die-for Alpha Romeo roadsters are found for the taking.Penn and his co-writers Don MacPherson (The Avengers) and Pete Travis (Dredd) havent worked their pens as hard as Sean did his biceps. If they had The Gunman might have more to show for itself than thinly sketched characters a vacant plot and spent cartridge shells. Speaking of dizzy thats what Jim becomes at inopportune moments when bullets fly which is often. A doc diagnoses him with ""post-concussion syndrome"" fruitlessly advising him to avoid stress (insert hollow laugh).The original French novel had the Jim character carrying around a non-fatal bullet in his head. This was likely deemed too close to the condition of Robert Carlyles villain in The World Is Not Enough one of the distinctly lesser films in the James Bond canon.""Distinctly lesser"" could also describe Sean Penns entree into the action fraternity which leaves us wondering what might have happened if hed managed to find a sense of humour always an asset in movies such as these.He almost smiles when another character inquires about his intentions. To which he replies ""I just need to shoot something.""

Close Join the conversation... With GuideLive Contributor Share This Story Share Discuss Meh At one point in The Gunman the new Sean Penn geopolitical thriller our star goes surfing. Its supposed to show he has a reckless side since hes surfing in unsafe territory but it seems to have a larger much more obvious purpose To show us that Penn at 54 is ripped. Very very ripped.Its no accident that the trailer for The Gunman notes prominently that it comes from the director of Taken (Pierre Morel) the 2008 thriller that transformed Liam Neeson into a no-nonsense border-hopping middle-aged action star. Despite the high-minded issues ostensibly at play here - Western commercial exploitation of Africa guilt and penance love and abandonment - we soon realize the goal is pretty much the same as in Taken to have us watch Penns muscles ripple as he kicks butt in a variety of picturesque locales.We begin in 2006 in the Congo where mercenary Jim Terrier (Penn) an ex-special forces man working ostensibly in security is up to something dodgy with his band of European former military types who include Felix (Javier Bardem extra smarmy here) and Cox (the great stage actor Mark Rylance). One morning Jim says goodbye to girlfriend Annie (Italian actress Jasmine Trinca). She thinks hell be picking her up later at the health clinic where she works. He says he hopes he wont be working late. We know from Penns face that it might be a long while indeed before he returns. Ray Winstone as Stanley left and Sean Penn as Jim Terrier in ""The Gunman."" Keith Bernstein/TNS That same night as it happens Jims task is to assassinate the countrys mining minister on behalf of his shadowy foreign bosses. His mission accomplished Jim needs to leave and fast. We dont see him again for eight years with action shifting to various spots in Europe and Africa.Then its back to Barcelona where Annie is in great peril. The bloody finale takes place - Where else? - in the citys famed bullfighting ring with Jims desperate fight for survival competing with that of the poor bull.Will Jim Terrier survive unlike the bull (though actually bullfighting is now banned in Barcelona)? And will Penns new action-hero persona survive and flourish? Not clear. Penn - who co-wrote and produced here - doesnt wear the aging action hero mantle as comfortably as Neeson. And with his famous piercing intensity were really looking for more character and more story from him and less shoot-em-up.OK weve seen the biceps and the abs. Very nice.

USA TODAYJim (Sean Penn) and Annie (Jasmine Trinca) come under fire in The Gunman.(Photo Joe Alblas Open Road Films via AP)The only redeeming feature about The Gunman is its exotic locations.Opening in the Congo and later zipping around London Barcelona and Gibraltar this lackluster tale of a reformed hitman has little else to offer ( 1/2; rated R; opens Friday nationwide).Unless youre aching to see Sean Penns impressively chiseled pecs and abs -- which he shows off early and often -- give this monotonous thriller a pass.Apparently Penn wants to reinvent himself as a buff middle-aged action star so hes teamed up with Taken director Pierre Morel who successfully reinvented the career of Liam Neeson.But the question is why. A versatile dramatic actor Penn also has proven himself a top-notch filmmaker. His nimble direction of 2007s Into the Wild was breathtaking. So do fiftysomething serious actors harbor a burning desire to star in inane violent action films? Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare This action thriller from the director of Taken stars Sean Penn and Idris Elba. VPC If so its about as effective in reversing the sands of time. Given Penns well-known politics and the storys opening in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2006 Gunman initially appears to be a fairly intriguing look at corporate exploitation of the region. But The Constant Gardener this is not. That intricate 2005 thriller exposed corruption as it unspooled a complex mystery. This aims for Bourne territory but doesnt come close to that exciting deftly made spy saga.Penn stars as Jim Terrier an assassin responsible for a key political hit in the Congo. He also has a romance going with Annie (Jasmine Trinca). His murderous attack requires him to leave the country immediately so he asks his colleague Felix (Javier Bardem) to keep an eye out for Annie. Guilt propels him to return to Africa -- in present day -- and this time help the locals. He also finds time for some gnarly surfing. (His Fast Times at Ridgemont High character Spicoli would have approved.). But when Jims life is endangered out on the grassland he flies back to London to find out why hes a target. The dialogue is cliched. ""I did some bad things"" Jim says and somehow were supposed to feel for this cold-hearted killer.His former associates are not exactly brimming with sympathy ""The past is the past my friend"" Cox (Mark Rylance) tells him. It turns out Felix has taken Jims request very seriously. Hes married Annie and they live in Barcelona. Jim heads there ostensibly to gather information. He hasnt been in touch with his old flame for years but when they lay eyes on each other they instantly reconnect passionately. It helps that the handsome Felix is inexplicably nasty to his wife and has been jealous of Jim all these years. Usually a compelling actor Bardem is over-the-top in a one-dimensional role.The macho action tropes -- car chases shoot-outs -- dont mesh well with the would-be love story. Its hard for audiences to become invested given that Jims character is so unsympathetic and Annie is a cardboard cutout.

Its not how the film reflects Penns commitment to international activism as it chases trade exploiters from the Congo to London Barcelona and Gibraltar. Its not his diving awards-show deep into the character of Jim Terrier who atones for his history as a corporate sniper by killing a lot of guys. Its his guns. His new abnormally inflated arms. If any element Penn brought to this production gives it a good box-office boost its his remarkably beefy biceps. He makes Stallone look like a slacker. Penn resembles an Instagram selfie you would get from an annoying friend telling you hes way into crossfit and tanning right now. His muscles transform him from a thespian not born to be an action star into an actor who would make a good Hulk if he were taller. The term ""vanity project"" has never seemed so descriptive. ""The Gunman"" follows a trajectory remarkably similar to that of recent Liam Neeson films. Terrier is a former assassin with particular skills that are underestimated by everybody. His relationship with his lady friend (Jasmine Trinca) ends badly when she marries a snotty entrepreneur (Javier Bardem). Then shes captured by a large number of bad guys and its up to Terrier who is interested in rekindling their romance to rescue her. More pretentious than riveting ""The Gunman"" focuses a whole heap on political themes. Its as if Penn is drawing realpolitik from his last starring role in 2010s CIA drama ""Fair Game"" but taking it to more macho territory. In one of the numerous fight sequences the riled-up Penn thrashes an aging motherly type with a fist to her skull. She doesnt die right away. It takes her a minute to collapse from the trauma so French action director Pierre Morel revisits her with the camera at the end so we can see her fall like a stunned ox. The film boasts a carefully collected supporting cast with Idris Elba Ray Winstone and the acclaimed English stage actor Mark Rylance giving their all as good men or henchmen. Morels direction is solid enough keeping the cameras cross hairs on heaps of well-choreographed conflict and mostly avoiding the too-fast cuts and too-close shots that turn fights into viewer guessing games. It takes several swings at the forceful relevant subject of black ops contractors serving far-off financiers pursuing African minerals. Photos provided by Open Road Films Sean Penn is a former assassin attempting to rescue a former love in ""The Gunman."" Its the pretentious script that handicaps the film most. Penn and his fellow actors are fine at conversation but there are more dialogue-driven subplots here than a movie full of bullets and land mines requires. It tries to give the protagonist emotional heft with a raft of health problems from his violent past but seeing Penns Terrier lose consciousness and pass out at random doesnt create inherently suspenseful moments. And while Terrier is remarkably street-smart about dealing with lethal enemies in human affairs he is an elder Jeff Spicoli. ""The Gunman"" could have been an OK time-filler if it didnt fire so many blanks. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Comments click to enlarge The Gunman Video Rated R  115 minutes  2015 I can imagine Sean Penn agreeing to star in this Taken knockoff on the condition that it educate moviegoers about humanitarian crises in Africa; it does but the film feels misshapen as a result. Penn plays a retired mercenary still haunted by an assassination he carried out in Congo eight years earlier; when the organization that ordered the hit decides to rub him out the soldier of fortune goes on the run kills lots of people in self-defense etc. Pierre Morel who directed Taken (2008) delivers something very similar here alternating between action and rather turgid drama.

Other investments? Socking away cash under a mattress?If youre a Hollywood actor aging out of the traditional leading-man bracket you may have a different option.Become an action star.It seems counterintuitive to start running around cracking heads and shooting people when in theory you should be slowing down. But look at what action films have done for Liam Neeson and his ""very particular set of skills"" -- theyve given his career an unlikely boost.Will it work for others? Sean Penn is trying to find out it seems. He stars in ""The Gunman"" a different sort of role for the two-time Oscar winner. His character too has deadly skills that he uses when the occasion calls for them and it calls for them often.Lest you wonder whether this is a conscious effort well the director of ""The Gunman"" is Pierre Morel -- who directed ""Taken"" the film that solidified Neesons later-in-the-game status as an action star.As for Penn a legitimately great actor well its a work in progress. ""The Gunman"" is a predictable slog through action-movie tropes and Penns intensity isnt a good fit.On the other hand he looks as if hes really been working out.The film begins in 2006 in the Democratic Republic of Congo where Penns Jim Terrier (woof) ostensibly works as security at mining sites but in reality is an assassin. His girlfriend Annie (Jasmine Trinca) a doctor on a humanitarian mission doesnt know about his deadlier job. Nor does she suspect that Felix (Javier Bardem) works for the same outfit. She does suspect that Felix wants her to dump Jim for him because he basically tells her every chance he gets.The group assassinates the minister of mining and Felix makes the call that makes Jim the trigger man. That means he has to leave the country immediately. It also means leaving Annie behind with Felix on the case so to speak.Eight years later Jim is back in the Congo this time doing humanitarian work. Hes haunted by his past and in more ways than one A group of men shows up where hes working and tries to kill him.So Jim has to figure out who and why though men with blood on their hands often have the why part figured out already. He travels to London and tracks down an old friend Stanley (Ray Winstone rumpled and disheveled; you can practically smell the cigarette smoke on him) who knows where to turn up answers. He also checks in with former Congo colleague Cox (Mark Rylance) who now works -- in bespoke suits -- for the company that employed them years before.All this leads Jim to Barcelona where Felix is a successful businessman -- and married to Annie. Nevertheless Annie is soon running for her life alongside Jim from bad guys whose identity comes as no surprise.Its all workmanlike in part because a few interesting ideas arent explored enough. One is the setting -- settings really. For the most part they serve simply as backdrops. At other times theyre strange the movies climax takes place at a bullfight a sport Barcelona banned in 2012.Another is Jims illness. All of his special-ops work back in the day has created a kind of plaque on his brain that leads to memory loss mirroring early Alzheimers. The doctor stresses that the situation is dire and that Jim needs to stay calm and quiet.With killers on your tail thats difficult. But the malady comes and goes whenever its convenient to the script (written by among others Penn).But the biggest waste is Idris Elba. He gets second billing but shows up only toward the end and then briefly as an Interpol agent. He sits down beside Jim on a park bench and they engage in a ridiculous roundabout conversation that uses a tree-house metaphor to mask what theyre really talking about. Elba is a terrific actor and a strong screen presence but this tests even his abilities.Through it all races Penn with a concussive force (his illness when it shows up causes horrible headaches something Morel mimics throughout the film). Hes shirtless some of the time looking like he does about 1000 sit-ups a day.Good for him. Hes 54 after all. Nobody said the aging-actor-action-star retirement plan was easy.The Gunman2 stars (out of 5) Director Pierre Morel.Cast Sean Penn Idris Elba Jasmine Trinca.Rating R for strong violence language and some sexuality.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Updated July 30 2016  1153 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Sean Penn flexes his muscles as The Gunman By Joe Williams St. Louis Post-Dispatch Joe Williams Mar 19 2015 (...) In the Book of Regenesis we learn that Liam Neeson in the ""Taken"" movies begat Denzel Washington in ""Safe House"" which begat Kevin Costner in ""Three Days to Kill"" which begat Pierce Brosnan in ""The November Man.""Now the latest aging star to play an ex-CIA agent who gets dragged back into the game is Sean Penn in ""The Gunman."" At 54 as taut and weathered as a leather belt Penn might be the most believably badass of them all. And with ""Taken"" director Pierre Morel at the helm the film doesnt insult our intelligence the way most of the knock-off movies do. But neither does it add much to the dialogue about the human or political consequences of American power. Its simply a well-executed thriller that leaves us stirred but not shaken.Penn plays Jim Terrier who works for a private security firm that protects medical-relief workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (also known as Zaire but more properly called the Worst Place on Earth) circa 2006. Terrier is tough as nails but he has a soft spot for doctor Annie (Jasmine Trinca). Terrier is forced to leave the Congo after his real employers enlist him to assassinate the nations interior minister who is standing in the way of multinational corporations. Thats the kind of topic we expect a Sean Penn-produced movie to investigate yet the African characters are merely stick figures.Eight years later Terrier is back in Africa; but despite his morning surf ritual hes got a bum ticker that symbolizes his noisy conscience. When local thugs try to snuff him he smells the dirty hand of his old employer and travels back to Europe to crack the case. All too predictably every ex-colleague who ever gave Terrier a fishy look (or gave Annie a lascivious one) is a suspect in the deadly double-cross. So the movie devolves into a checklist.At the top of the list is Felix (Javier Bardem) whos living a little too comfortably in Spain. Bardem should not put his performance on a highlight reel and neither should Idris Elba who inexplicably gets second billing as an Interpol agent who arrives just in time for a last-act shootout in Gibraltar.The best excuse for watching ""The Gunman"" is Penn. His first mainstream leading role in a decade is worthy of comparisons to Matt Damon in the ""Bourne"" movies; yet its also disappointingly shorn of the humor and humanity of which this great actor is capable. The saving grace is that the paycheck will allow him to continue doing good works in real life. Maybe ""The Gunman 2"" can take place in Haiti.What ""The Gunman""  Two and half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 155  Content Violence language and some sexuality Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Sean Penn The Gunman Joe Williams Javier Bardem Idris Elba Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Director Pierre Morel (155). R Violence sexuality language. Area theaters. Sean Penns bad side makes for good action-drama in ""The Gunman."" Theres a grubby redemptive quality that makes this tough-minded flick feel like the son of ""Serpico"" and ""Salvador."" Jim Terrier (Penn) works as an armed protector for a humanitarian organization in the Peoples Republic of Congo circa 2006. But Terrier is also secretly a gunman-for-hire. After assassinating a high-level official he flees Congo his girlfriend Annie (a beguiling Jasmine Trinca) and his identity. Eight years later Terrier is back in Congo and on edge after an attempt is made on his life. He first suspects the person behind it is his former partner Felix (Javier Bardem) -- now married to Annie -- but it could be his ex-boss Cox (Mark Rylance). Crisscrossing from Africa to London to Madrid Terrier learns that the mercenary life has dangerous blowback -- no matter how good your intentions are. ""The Gunman"" is directed by Pierre Morel. He made ""Taken"" and the junky ""From Paris With Love"" but now shows an admirable level of restraint. Though the fistfights are frenetic things are grounded in reality. Every action brings a reaction. Theres still a lack of genre-specific imagination to some parts of the script based on a novel by Jean-Patrick Manchette. Yet there is undeniably as much brains as brawn and a smattering of chewy character turns from Bardem Rylance and Ray Winstone (as Jims burly buddy Stan). Jasmine Trinca in ""The Gunman"" (Keith Bernstein/(c) Silver Pictures Studio Canal) Penn a two-time Oscar winner has never given less than his all in worthy projects and lesser ones. This one falls into a middle ground but its clear the actor-director-activist brought along his social concerns. The film addresses refugee plight corporate-governmental collaboration and the need for a global humanitarian conscience. That all gives ""The Gunman"" echoes of the mindful but meaty 70s thrillers. Its also a movie of its day. The action hero stars of the moment are either old men or young women a dynamic no doubt familiar to the power brokers in Hollywood. Penn may seem an odd fit but as an actor hes on target. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews sean penn jasmine trinca javier bardem mark rylance Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

""The Gunman"" follows the story of Terrier as he digs into his past to figure out who wants him dead. (Open Road Films) By Ann Hornaday March 19 2015 Follow AnnHornaday At least for an hour or so ""The Gunman"" looks like it might be pretty good -- a well-made politically aware action thriller that makes up for its generic plotting with an outstanding cast and sharp keenly observed atmospherics. Then it all just goes kerblooey and nobody gets out unscathed. Before it flies fatally off the rails Sean Penn fuses seamlessly with his character a sharpshootin international aid worker named Jim Terrier whose macho bona fides and pugnacious idealism play perfectly into Penns off-screen persona. Penn takes every opportunity he can to strip down in ""The Gunman"" the better to show off an impressively buff torso. He also makes sure that this story -- directed by Pierre Morel and based on Jean-Patrick Manchettes novel -- always puts him on the side of the angels even when bullets fly fists crack knives impale and bombs explode with promiscuous abandon. After all Morel is the man who so memorably helped resuscitate Liam Neesons career with the surprise 2008 hit ""Taken."" But anyone taking a cue from that mid-career resurrection may want to consider the recent box office take of ""Cinderella"" which soundly beat ""Taken""-knockoff ""Run All Night"" when the two films opened alongside each other last weekend. And theyll surely want to commission a script that makes smarter use not just of Penn -- who manages to exert unbeatable screen charisma no matter how ludicrous the movie -- but also of his co-stars including Mark Rylance Ray Winstone a hammy Javier Bardem and the lovely Italian actress Jasmine Trinca who injects a welcome note of earthy realism to her otherwise rote role as romantic foil. Say this for ""The Gunman"" It looks terrific hopping the globe from the Democratic Republic of Congo (played by South Africa) to Gibraltar to Barcelona. Unfortunately as the plot progresses the action and Terriers over-determined character arc including a lamentable physical side effect of his dubious career become exponentially more outlandish. It all comes to a preposterous head in a climactic scene staged in the storied Spanish toreadors arena known as La Monumental where the filmmakers try mightily for thrills and metaphorical weight but fail on a scale commensurate with the setting. ""The Gunman"" may start as a genre exercise of promising purpose but it winds up being just a lot of bull. 1 of 99 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x What not to watch View Photos A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics.

"The Gunman review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review The Gunman The Gunman Open Road Films Sean Penn plays a gun-toting international aid worker in ""The Gunman."" Sean Penn plays a gun-toting international aid worker in ""The Gunman."" (Open Road Films) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Sean Penn muscles in on ""Taken"" territory with this routine brutal thriller. Speedy brutality is the spoonful of sugar in most action movies making the narrative medicine go down for as large an international audience as possible. Im not blowing any surprises by pointing this out. Besides with ""The Gunman"" the surprises keep on not coming. Youve seen a lot of it before either in ""Taken"" (the same director Pierre Morel did this one) or out of ""Taken.""The cast tones things up and Sean Penns muscle tone certainly tones things up. Barcelona Spain is used rather well as a key locale in this tale of a guilt-wracked (but ready for more) contract killer struggling with his conscience his cumulative head trauma and a world of venal corporate interests that make it hard for a humanitarian to stick to his principles. Penns listed among the producers on ""The Gunman"" as well as receiving screenplay credit alongside Don MacPherson and Pete Travis. Just as Liam Neeson was in his mid-50s when ""Taken"" transformed him into a slaying badass Penn is now 54 and positioning himself with this project as a franchise team leader in the making.The movie however lacks the clean vengeful lines of ""Taken"" and Penns game isnt weary gravity; its boiling-kettle-of-rage which is a tougher sit. The Penn character goes by the name Jim Terrier (Jim Corgi probably didnt sound tough enough) whose main job is in private security but whose sideline is killing for a fee. The film begins in the Republic of the Congo in 2006; Jims lover (Jasmine Trinca) is a surgeon saving lives among the machete victims in a makeshift hospital. She does not know about her mans sideline. With his security colleagues played by Mark Rylance and Javier Bardem the surly Yank assassinates a high-ranking Congolese politician and per his orders slips away while chaos reigns.The rest of ""The Gunman"" taken from a French novel concerns Jims efforts to outrun the shadow forces who come after him years later. They are well-dressed and have lousy eyesight. They never hit and our anguished hero never misses. The supporting ensemble comes from all over. Rylance Idris Elba (as a supercool Interpol agent) and Ray Winstone as Jims pal and protector are English; Trinca is Italian; Peter Franzen one of the hapless hit men hails from Finland; Bardem is of course Spanish. Latest movies reviewedOpen link Its a tasty cast but the script does not do its job in crucial areas letting the audience get way way out ahead of the reveals. The early scenes make it thuddingly clear whos not to be trusted and too much of the ""The Gunman"" requires Jim to play catch-up while snapping necks and detonating explosive devices and monologuing about the inhumanity of it all.That last part is pretty rich considering. Films like ""The Gunman"" are nothing without their hypocrisies -- the necessary frictions between the heros reluctance to slaughter (most of all Penns character wants to provide clean water to impoverished villages) and the blood-spilling requirements of the plot. Director Morel brings some style and speed to the proceedings though I found ""The Gunman"" increasingly numbing in the carnage department. Compared with someone like Neeson Penns avenging angel is a less relatable fellow. The smoking is another matter entirely; Penn and his co-stars light up so often in ""The Gunman"" you wonder if even his French director thought he might be overdoing it.""The Gunman"" - 2 stars MPAA rating R (for strong violence language and some sexuality)Running time 155Opens Thursday eveningmjphillipstribpub.com Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Reviews Review Insurgent Review The Hunting Ground Review An Honest Liar Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-the-gunman-20150319-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,thegunman23,thegunman,chicagotribune

Sean Penn as Jim Terrier in ""The Gunman."" Photo Keith Bernstein McClatchy-Tribune News Service Sean Penn has a problem in Gunman Hes a killer who cares 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The action scenes in ""The Gunman"" are expertly handled and that should come as no surprise with director Pierre Morel calling the shots here. Morel directed the original and best of the ""Taken"" series and though that movie is especially remembered for Liam Neesons set of skills Morels mix of propulsion and clarity was a big part of its success. Some action directors seem to shut off their minds when the action starts figuring if they just shake the camera and cut fast enough the mere fact of action will hold audiences to their seats. Morel sees action as an opportunity. He has the audiences attention and now hes going to stretch things out add the frightening and telling detail and make you suffer in the best way. He puts the viewer in the protagonists shoes. This time the shoes are worn by Sean Penn which means a different kind of action movie something with some ideas and a conscience but not so many ideas or so big a conscience as to slow things down. When we first meet him he is working in Congo for a mining company. He has a few overt benign functions but we get the feeling that more is going on and this is soon confirmed when he is assigned to assassinate a politician. Basically ""The Gunman"" is a movie that asks audiences to sympathize with the equivalent of Lee Harvey Oswald -- that is an Oswald who definitely did it. Oddly enough it succeeds partly because the moral climate it presents seems so confused but mainly because of Penns particular aura of irascible integrity. Hes the most irritated action hero since Harrison Ford. It helps that the poor gunman feels really guilty about his crime. Killing that politician pretty much wrecked his life. It separated him from his fiancee and from his own sense of himself. He already wishes he could take it all back -- even before people come out of the woodwork eight years later looking to murder him. And thats pretty much the action of ""The Gunman"" Once Jim (Penn) arrives at the disconcerting realization that people want him dead his mission is to find out who is behind it while fending off attacks from scores of hired assassins. Morel gives the impression that if he ever made a movie with fewer than 50 corpses hed have a hard time looking at himself in the mirror. Though the story might have a certain sameness (calm interlude followed by attack; then a shorter calm interlude followed by a bigger attack) the action varies enough and the central mystery is arresting enough that ""The Gunman"" maintains a sure grip on the viewer. The sequence in which Jim and his former fiancee (Jasmine Trinca) try to escape a besieged country house is a model for that sort of scene -- its extreme detailed and not too far-fetched. A later action sequence at a Spanish bullfight is equally effective. Just for fun the story -- based on the novel by Jean-Patrick Manchette -- gives Jim the added handicap of a traumatic brain injury. Its the movies wild card Whenever it looks as if he might have the upper hand the old head pain and blurred vision kick in. Along the way ""The Gunman"" conveys a sense of some vast unseen underworld in which there are people who can always get you a car or fake papers or an unregistered gun; and who know how to do things -- as in everything associated with survival. But ""The Gunman"" is not about the glamour of this kind of existence. Rather it emphasizes the spiritual cost to life on the fringes. Javier Bardem is particularly good in a supporting role showing the perverting effects of fear and guilt. As Jims once and future girlfriend Trinca serves an important function as the movies lone civilian. Shes the one who convinces us that Jim could be redeemed that his life might be worth living. In a way shes like the daughter in ""Taken."" She tethers him to earth just enough that we care what happens to him. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"The Gunman (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Gunman (R) Sean Penn stars as an ex-mercenary hunted by his former bosses. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com3/19/2015 Editor rating 2 The Gunman is the first pure action picture Sean Penn has ever starred in a considerable feat for an actor whose career spans 34 years yet has never succumbed to the temptation of cashing in on a brainless timekiller. Penns presence piques your curiosity There must be more to this globe-hopping shoot-em-up than your typical Bruce Willis or Liam Neeson vehicle. With a supporting cast that includes Javier Bardem Idris Elba and Ray Winstone and with a script co-written by Penn himself and based on a well-regarded novel by the late French crime writer Jean-Patrick Manchette this one has to have some meat to go along with the gunplay right? Sadly no. Penn remains a furiously committed method actor even in a paycheck role such as this one. He disappears into the role of Jim Terrier a former Special Forces sniper turned assassin who killed a high-ranking government official in the Republic of Congo six years earlier and is now targeted for extermination himself by the same man (Bardem) who hired him to carry out the job. Penn takes a dead-serious approach to the role transforming his body into the jacked buff physique of a bodybuilder which explains why hes often shirtless in the film (""I didnt spend this much time in the gym for nothing""). But the 54-year-old actor is actually a detriment to the movie because this trite scenario -- hes playing a rogue agent trying to outsmart his former bosses like Jason Bourne -- has no use for his talent other than the intensity and concentration he radiates when hes trying to extricate himself from an impossible situation. The Gunman was directed by Pierre Morel who also directed Taken and From Paris with Love both of which centered on American hit men/government agents wreaking havoc throughout Europe too. Morel has an impersonal filmmaking style -- hes good at orchestrating mayhem but people dont seem to interest him much -- and the movie feels like its going through the motions whenever it stops on Jims old friend and informant (Ray Winstone) or his former girlfriend (Jasmine Trinca) who is now sleeping with the enemy and has a knack for landing in constant peril. The Gunman isnt offensively bad and to the directors credit it feels a lot shorter than its two-hour running time. But aside from the spectacle of Penn taking a paycheck role as seriously as he took Dead Man Walking or Milk theres absolutely nothing new here except for a sequence set at a bullfighting ring in Spain in which one of the animals busts loose and goes on a rampage. The movies half-hearted attempt to give the story some political bite is drowned out by the gunfire which seems to interest Morel the most. For a few minutes there The Gunman achieves the sort of R-rated bloody fun the trailers promised. But soon its back to the same-old proving that even serious Oscar-winning actors sometimes need a little extra cash to help pay the bills.

EntertainmentMovies The Gunman Its Taken with less blah and more bang Originally published March 19 2015 at 1205 am Updated March 19 2015 at 616 am Sean Penn plays an assassin turned humanitarian in ""The Gunman."" (Keith Bernstein) A movie review of ""The Gunman"" Director Pierre Morel swaps out Liam Neeson for a younger buffer Sean Penn but leaves the ""Taken"" formula intact less blah blah more bang bang. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times Of the two Liam Neeson movies released this month the better one is the one without Liam Neeson in it. Last weeks ""Run All Night"" gave us the real McCoy the Neeson whos worn out his welcome playing aging action heroes. This weeks ""The Gunman"" gives us Sean Penn-as-Neeson not quite as old not so obviously weary of the whole action shtick and a whole lot more buff. Sinewy and heavily muscled playing many scenes sans shirt Penn is one impressive physical specimen perfectly suited for the kick-butt-and-take-names exertions that ""The Gunman"" calls on him to perform. The key element that makes ""The Gunman"" a significantly more satisfactory Neesonesque outing than Neesons recent efforts is its director Pierre Morel. Hes the man who launched the big guy on his current action arc with ""Taken."" And hes taken the ""Taken"" formula and applied it effectively to ""The Gunman."" Simply stated that formula is less blah blah more bang bang. Movie Review 1/2   The Gunman with Sean Penn Jasmine Trinca Javier Bardem Ray Winstone. Directed by Pierre Morel from a screenplay by Don MacPherson Pete Travis and Penn. 115 minutes. Rated R for strong violence language and some sexuality. Several theaters. ""Run All Night"" gets bogged down with a lot of gassy exposition between Neeson and Ed Harris. Theres some expository blather to set ""Gunman"" in motion but Morel quickly gets down to the meat of the matter with lots of scenes of lots of gunmen trying to put lots of bullets in the Penn characters brawny hide.

These killers could use a refresher course in tradecraft. In one scene they repeatedly phone Javier Bardems character who is trying to set Jim up for the hit to let him know theyre coming. Jim is in the room when the calls come in. Stupid Theres a woman to be protected (Jasmine Trinca). There is a debilitating brain condition that inconveniences our hero with fainting spells and a bad case of the staggers but miraculously clears up whenever bad guys need to be shot. There is a chase through a Spanish bullfighting stadium. There will be bulls. There will be horns. There will be blood. So yes there are plot holes aplenty but the action is tautly staged by Morel and that makes ""The Gunman"" a satisfactory time-passer. Maybe Mr. Neeson should give his old colleague a call.

Photo Credit TNS / Keith Bernstein advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A mercenarys misdeeds come back to haunt him. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE A lightweight thriller posing as a heavy political drama or vice-versa. Not thoughtful and no fun. CAST Sean Penn Javier Bardem Jasmine Trinca LENGTH 155 The image of a shirtless Sean Penn toting a surfboard along a beach in the Congo Republic sets up certain expectations for ""The Gunman."" Weve already seen Penns mercenary character Jim Terrier shoot a man with a high-powered rifle but its his gym-toned musculature that tells us were watching an action film. To paraphrase Chekhov If you introduce a bulging bicep in the first act youd better use it by the third. ""The Gunman"" seems to be Penns attempt to join the ranks of older action stars like Liam Neeson whose ""Taken"" became an international hit in 2008. That films director Pierre Morel also directs this one. ""The Gunman"" has the simple structure of a genre flick a hero haunted by his past the girl he must protect the friend who becomes an enemy. advertisement | advertise on newsday So who decided to turn this potentially entertaining thriller into a dour drama about global politics? The screenwriting credits offer a clue Along with two other names theres Penn. Its hard not to suspect that the actor known for his humanitarian efforts abroad is the one asking us to confront third-world poverty and American culpability even though all we really want is a good fistfight. Penns Terrier is the movies biggest problem. Hes a tough protagonist to like -- a paid assassin who murders an idealistic Congolese politician. He regrets it mostly because he must leave the country and his relief-worker girlfriend Annie (Jasmine Trinca). Years later Terrier himself lands on a hit list and seeks help from an old crony Felix (an overripe Javier Bardem). Care to guess whom Felix has married? ""The Gunman"" puts Penn in a few decent brawls and shootouts (and make-outs) but his Terrier is mostly interior The actor squints and smokes a lot. What grit the film has comes from two Brits Mark Rylance and Ray Winstone (""Sexy Beast"") as hard-nosed black-op types. 227 MoviesThe Gunman trailer ""The Gunman"" aspires to the moody ambience of Peter Weirs ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" but its too trivial to be taken seriously and too serious to be any fun. As an action-hero bemoaning his role in the developing world Penn shoots himself in the foot.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Very loosely adapted from a Jean-Patrick Manchette novel The Gunman stars Sean Penn as a former mercenary who finds himself hunted by hit squads and Interpol agents. Penn who produced and co-wrote the film at least has the look down. Bulked up and severely tanned with arms crisscrossed by hard veins he resembles a more realistically proportioned Sylvester Stallone. But though the combination of close-quarters combat and ham-fisted geopolitics can be surprisingly palatable The Gunman is too disorganized and sloppy to make sense as political commentary or to work on the most basic level as a globe-trotting chase thriller. Directed by Pierre Morel (Taken) and shot by Flavio Labiano another veteran of the Liam Neeson thriller circuit The Gunman sticks closely to the Neeson formula serious actor in an action star role; super-competent problem-solving hero shaded by guilt; unseen villain; tourist-friendly urban locations; gruesome fights staged in stairwells and hallways. Morel has always had a knack for the latter. His brutal overcast style which creates a sense of momentum by having the camera lunge along with the characters is made for goons pummeling and knifing each other in tight spaces. The difference is that Morels previous features (District B13 the aforementioned Taken From Paris With Love) were constantly in motion the sort of movies where windows are always leapt through doors are only ever kicked down and cars only stop by crashing. The Gunman isnt one of these movies. Its a dawdling barely coherent corporate mystery involving mining contracts and congressional subpoenas tacked with clumsy asides about the importance of NGOs in providing essential services in the developing world. Its easy to point the finger at the script credited to the unlikely trio of Penn Dredd director Pete Travis and re-write specialist Don MacPherson; if ever a movie felt like it was glued together from unrelated drafts this is it. Or maybe its just ego Jim Terrier (Penn) is a bona fide star construct a ruggedly handsome killer with a dark past who also really cares about humanitarian relief. Though The Gunman pulls together a small handful of vicious set pieces--a shoot-out at a country villa a fight against machete-carrying hired killers--most of the movie speaks to Morels difficulty sustaining interest in anything other than violence. (The exception is the effective opening set over a long night in the Democratic Republic Of The Congo in 2006; under-lit to the point that it skirts legibility it seems to come from a different movie altogether.) Theres an undeveloped romance with an old flame (Jasmine Trinca miscast); plenty of good actors given nothing to do (Javier Bardem and especially Idris Elba whose role consists of flicking a lighter twice and rambling through a monologue about treehouses); endless scenes of Terrier shuffling around London and Barcelona with a camo backpack usually while following someone or being followed or both; and a ludicrous bullfight arena climax that Morel seems to have no interest in staging. After a while The Gunman comes to resemble Terrier himself prone to memory lapses and migraines after a lifetime spent around war zones and gunfire. A viewer can almost feel the movie reminding itself what its about the same way Terrier continually scribbles plot points down in his Moleskine. How else would one explain the final sequence in which a newscaster directly addresses the audience to explain the ending?

For meat-headed incoherence a badly written poorly directed and confusingly acted muddle of global nonsense The Gunman is another ill-conceived entry in the latest dopey trend of middle-aged men blowing up stuff in an attempt to carve off a piece of the macho action market deserted years ago by Robert Mitchum and now newly dominated by Liam Neeson. THE GUNMAN  (1/4 stars) Written by Don MacPherson and Pete Travis Directed by Pierre Morel Starring Sean Penn Idris Elba and Javier Bardem Running time 115 min. But mostly its just a lame excuse to show off what the diminutive Sean Penns been doing lately at the gym. He surfs. He strips down for the shower. He takes off his shirt for no reason. Hes got pecs he never had in Milk. Unfortunately nobody ever won an Oscar for washboard abs. And nobody is going to win five seconds of admiration for 115 minutes of tedium in The Gunman. Itll be on the video shelf at Walgreens before the Fourth of July. The plot co-authored by Don MacPherson and Pete Travis has something vaguely to do with the star as a combination assassin/hit man in the Congo named Jim who murders the Minister of Mining while falling for a pretty surgeon named Annie played with vapid insignificance by Jasmine Trinca. Jims partner in crime and enemy in love is Felix (Javier Bardem whose performance consists of a series of flaring nostrils and blazing stares). Jim flees the Congo then returns eight years later to dig wells. When the bad guys show up to kill him for what he did to the crooked minister in 2006 he flees again first to London where he looks up his old teammates Cox (theater icon Mark Rylance slumming from his stage triumphs to make some money for a change) and Stanley (cockney character Ray Winstone whose accent obliterates everything he says in a bowl  of porridge). They all move on (for reasons never explained) to Barcelona where the missing Annie is now married to the violent Felix and teaching school. First a doctor then a teacher and then hanging out in an adoption agency they write her in whenever the men stop to rest; no wonder Italian actress Trinca is so wooden. Between explosions bloody fistfights car chases and knocking off half the population of Spain Jim is warned to avoid stress because his brain is suffering from a deadly plague that could implode in the presence of loud noise. Hey theyre already in Spain so they all end up--again for no reason--at a bullfight. Since bullfighting is illegal in Barcelona you dont know whether to laugh or scratch your head in disbelief. The early clashes in the Congo between rebels and a government in chaos come to nothing. Jims head trauma caused from job-related concussions are quickly forgotten. Being pursued by both mercenaries and Interpol makes no sense. A bid for social relevance when the Congo is reduced to genocide is introduced and junked. Just what is this movie about? If clunky director Pierre Morel who helmed the first Taken flick with Liam Neeson has any idea hes not sharing. The Gunman hops around in time frames like Mexican jumping beans. Its lack of focus mixed-up acting styles (le Carre meets Our Man in Havana) and demented logic make it a candidate for loopiest action movie of the year. Sean Penns skintight jeans and bulging biceps cannot camouflage the age lines or dewlaps. I know jobs are scarce after a certain age but a fine actor appearing in this kind of bilge is a real blow. Worse still is watching Javier Bardem struggle to bring some life to a character that is underwritten to the point of cellophane. This time his trademark frowning glowering intensity just seems annoying. The Gunman is a disaster. Good helicopter bad movie.

Photo Keith Bernstein / Open Road Films MOVIE REVIEW The Gunman Running time 115 minutes. Rated R (sex profanity violence). Save the world while punching it in the face? Building a well for impoverished Third World peoples and killing three of same in the very same scene? Theres an angry-saint complex to ""The Gunman"" and you will not be surprised to learn that the title character is the creation of Sean Penn. Watching Penn pump iron and denounce capitalism for two hours would be roughly as illuminating as this monotonous Euro-thriller. Penn plays Jim an assassin-for-hire at a private security contractor fomenting unrest in the Congo. After taking out a government official at the behest of mining interests he is forced to flee the country without even informing his girl (Jasmine Trinca) who seeks solace in the arms of Jims supervisor (Javier Bardem). Eight years later the retired Jim is back in the Congo doing his penance on a water project when he is forced to exterminate three assassins sent to kill him. Most of the movie consists of Penn dispatching teams of professional yet easily outwitted killers. The Penn is mightier than the sword the assault rifle the grenade . . . Also Jim deals with serious brain damage by occasionally rubbing his temples. A shirtless Sean Penn.Photo Keith Bernstein / Open Road Films The movie is a tiresome vanity project co-written by Penn who seizes every opportunity to take his shirt off Theres even a random surfing scene which can be an advertisement only for either Penns built-up musculature or the Congo Surfing Commission. Does anyone want to see this grizzled 54-year-old capering around half-naked? With his fellow script-writers and director Pierre Morel (""Taken"") Penn forgot to make any other character a match for his. The girl 20 years his junior has nothing to do except lust after Jim. Bardem more painfully is relegated to being sullen until the embarrassing scene in which this supposed stone-cold professional reels around drunkenly and prostrates himself to the superior manliness of Jim. Mark Rylance as another colleague at the private security outfit is less a character than a billboard for the diabolical nexus of capitalism and warmongering. The script plays out with defiant predictability. So the filmmakers assume youll be fascinated by Penns macho glare and shoot-outs like those in a hundred other low-grade action flicks. ""I didnt wanna do this kind of s - - t anymore"" Penn cries. You and me both bro but I guess we both have to make a living.

To be fair The Gunman has loftier ambitions than the average Neeson run-and-shooter based on a popular French crime novel its the tale of taciturn ex-assassin Jim Terrier (Penn unnervingly ripped) who has traded in his sniper rifle for a spade and turned to digging clean water trenches in the developing world. When he begins to suspect that someones trying to bump him off Jim returns to London to track down and warn his old support team (including reformed ruffians Javier Bardem and Mark Rylance). The Gunman has its heart in the right place and theres no arguing with that none-more-grizzled cast Bardem and Rylance are both enjoyably unhinged Ray Winstone pops up as Penns grouchy protector and Idris Elba plays a shady official with a strange fetish for treehouses. But thanks to Taken director Pierre Morel this too often feels like just another slice of brainless Eurotrash packed with saw-it-coming plot twists half-hearted car chases and an angsty hero with mega muscles and zero charisma.

Even as a relative kid in 1982s Fast Times at Ridgemont High his sailor-on-shore-leave mug had a wry quizzical roughness to it; it was the face of a guy who could take a punch and perhaps already had. His mouth was almost perpetually half-downturned in either amusement or disgust. The beak of his nose was already well on its way to meeting the cleft in his chin the way any face as it ages begins to collapse on itself. Penns face today -- not so different just a little weather-beaten -- is a badge he didnt even have to earn. It suits him now more than ever. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - And sometimes its enough to anchor The Gunman the ambitious and only partially successful action thriller from Taken director Pierre Morel. Penns character soldier-turned-mercenary Jeff Terrier (that surname tells you a lot) is both a lover and a fighter capable of both intense lovesickness and high-and-mighty moral standards. As the movie opens Terrier is stationed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo circa 2006 a time of devastating national strife following years of civil war. Hes a former special-ops guy assigned to protect a group of NGO workers among them comely doctor Annie (Italian actress Jasmine Trinca) with whom hes romantically involved -- they nuzzle each other at the communal dinner table as Terriers bossy colleague Felix (a dyspeptic-looking Javier Bardem) slinks around jealously.Terrier may look and act as if hes someone who really cares but it becomes clear early on that hes accepted a not-so-selfless mission. Fast-forward eight years Hes a changed man now doing humanitarian aid in the Congo himself but hes also lost his lady love and worse yet someone is trying to kill him. In his WTF search for answers he treks first to London where he quizzes an old cohort (Mark Rylances Cox who with his slicked-back hair and Savile Row suit looks instantly guilty of something or other) seeks out another former associate for help (the welcome grizzled presence of Ray Winstone) and eventually treks to Barcelona intending to find out what his crabby old pal Felix is now up to.Film Details The Gunman RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time115 More Info Trailer All of that globe-trotting should be exhausting but Penns Terrier keeps his stride frequently removing his shirt so we can see how trim and finely sculpted his torso is If Penns got the face of a guy who survives whatever comes his way his body is definitely the sort of thing you have to work for. Penns vanity -- both in the way he shows off his bod and in the way he drives home the nobility of the once-wayward Terrier -- is either the most deeply annoying thing about The Gunman or the one thing in it that actually works. Im leaning toward the latter.The movie pretends to be much more serious than Taken but at its heart its just as silly. (Im still trying to figure out what the hell Bardem was doing in one scene rolling about with a champagne flute held aloft as gunfire breaks out around him.) And though Morel trots around to numerous glam locales -- bringing us ultimately to a bullfight abounding in splashes of color -- the result is still somehow lacking in glamor. It piles on the earnestness as if it were stacking sandbags in a flood zone. And who wants to see Javier Bardem playing a dickweed?But I happily spent most of The Gunman looking at and thinking about Penns face. This isnt a great Penn performance like the ones hes given in Casualties of War and Mystic River; its not even just a cannily delightful one as in Carlitos Way or Fast Times. Penn takes himself so seriously as an Actor with a capital A that he too easily trips himself up. Even though one of his most lauded performances in Gus Van Sants Milk shows a beating heart its also self-consciously actorish. Penn doesnt just want to act; he wants to do great things with his acting -- which paradoxically just ends up reminding us that were watching greatness rather than a human being.Maybe thats why its weirdly gratifying to watch him shooting guns and busting heads but ultimately just wanting to be a guy who helps poor little kids in Africa get healthy again. Penns need to be seen as a guy of integrity is left naked in The Gunman but at least hes having some fun with the action-movie trappings and with taking his shirt off. Terrier with his crown-of-thorns squint is sometimes comically cartoonish. But at least Penn so at home with the way he looks conveys the illusion of casualness. Outspoken in his political views and distrustful of all things shiny Penn may hate the idea of being a movie star. But hes got the face for it whether he likes it or not.Directed by Pierre Morel.

So when he does you go in with certain expectations. Sadly its best to leave them at the concession stand if youre planning on enjoying The Gunman. Directed by Pierre Morel the engineer of Liam Neesons macho second act in Taken the film starts off promisingly high-minded with a barrage of exposition about how Western corporations have exploited the mineral wealth of the civil-war-torn African nation the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And with the politically active Penn doing double duty as a producer and co-writer were primed for a heady dose of postcolonial guilt with our popcorn. But it doesnt take long for The Gunman to ditch its noble intentions and spiral into a rote series of chases shoot-outs and close-quarters knuckle-scraping brawls. Penn who appears to be in the best shape of his life at age 54 (despite the cigarette hanging from his lower lip) brings a layer of emotional depth that most actors couldnt summon playing a former mercenary reckoning with the bloody sins of his past. Too bad all the secondary characters in the film (from Javier Bardems dodgy do-gooder to Idris Elbas Interpol agent Jasmine Trincas love interest and Mark Rylances gravel-voiced villain) feel like they stumbled onto the set from a (better) Bourne flick. And while its nice to hopscotch around the globe from one exotic locale to the next this is the kind of film that cant be bothered to do any more with its Spanish setting than have a showdown at a bullfight. If Penn wanted The Gunman to be his version of Neesons recent black-and-blue period congrats. But I suspect he was aiming higher and came up short.

"The Gunman Review Sean Penn Tries to Make His Taken | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review The Gunman Guy Lodge Film Critic guylodge 20 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 6 2015 | 1100AM PT Sean Penns odd attempt to refashion himself as a middle-aged action hero wont give Liam Neeson any sleepless nights. ""The Guns Man"" might have been a more apt title for ""The Gunman"" given how much of Pierre Morels latest passport-brandishing shoot-em-up is dedicated to showcasing Sean Penns unexpectedly ripped physique. Sadly Penns veiny sweat-glazed biceps are the most objectively impressive feature of this rote humorless thriller a distinctly unconvincing attempt to refashion the star -- who also co-wrote and produced -- as a middle-aged action hero in the Liam Neeson mold. Covering similar stylistic territory to Morels megahit ""Taken"" with notional political context tacked on to fit its leading mans public persona this curious blend of exploitation pic and vanity project certainly wont be inaugurating an equivalent franchise but may hit its target in ancillary. Its been 10 years since two-time Oscar winner Penn last headlined a multiplex-ready genre pic (Sydney Pollacks comparatively upscale ""The Interpreter"" co-starring Nicole Kidman) but theres no precedent in his career for one quite like ""The Gunman"" which puts the 54-year-old actor through repeated bouts of violent frequently shirtless badassery. Prior to the release of ""Taken"" Neeson was a similarly unlikely candidate for tough-guy reinvention though he had mass-franchise credentials and took to B-movie stardom with a gravelly presence and deadpan wit that Penn for all his physical and thespian prowess cant quite muster here. When the imposingly charismatic Idris Elba pops up in a long-teased but perfunctory supporting role in the pics second half its hard not to think both actors might have been better off swapping roles. ""I dont want to do this s-- any more"" complains Penns Special Forces soldier-turned-assassin Jim Terrier -- a character name that could hardly be more patently writer-devised if it were Jack Russell. Whether the allusion to Danny Glovers deathless ""Lethal Weapon"" catchphrase is intentional or merely indicative of ""The Gunmans"" paucity of fresh ideas Terriers stone-faced weariness makes him an oddly difficult figure to root for. Penn has always excelled playing damaged human figures; perhaps his hand in the script (which he co-adapted with Don MacPherson and Pete Travis from a 1981 pulp novel by Frenchman Jean-Patrick Manchette) accounts for the degree of moral compromise in Terrier a well-meaning liberal atoning for corrupt acts in his past. Yet in presenting the character as both a fundamentally flawed hero and a rule-busting daredevil who literally goes surfing in unsafe waters -- cue our first extended gaze at Penns brick-built torso -- the star and filmmakers seek to have it both ways. This unhappy balance between right-on realism and heightened derring-do goes for the film at large. A none-too-authentic-looking Democratic Republic of Congo provides the backdrop for a 2006-set prologue Terrier and a group of European ex-military associates have been paid by an unspecified authority to execute the countrys minister of mining. As the designated trigger Terrier is forced to flee the country after successfully carrying out the mission leaving behind his (naturally) decades-younger g.f. Annie (Jasmine Trinca) who is unaware of the plot. In the wake of the assassination the country is plunged into a civil war Needless to say ""The Gunman"" is entirely blithe in its fabrication of Third World history. Eight years later Terrier is back in the Congo mildly PTSD-afflicted and worthily digging wells for an NGO. Though his mercenary days are behind him other parties arent willing to forgive and forget After narrowly escaping an attempt on his life he jets back to London enlisting the help of grizzled comrade Stanley (Ray Winstone on standard Cockney-geezer setting) to identify his attackers. His investigation also leads him to estranged colleagues Cox (Mark Rylance) now a suit working for their former contractors and Felix (Javier Bardem dripping smarm and hair oil) a wily Barcelona-based businessman with a range of stakes in Africa.  To Terriers greater consternation he has also coerced a reluctant Annie -- an intelligent professional woman with apparently no romantic agency of her own -- into marriage. From this setup the action skips through a predictable succession of standoffs and shootouts across Spain and Gibraltar -- directed with anonymous efficiency by Morel albeit rather more distinctively scored by a typically zealous Marco Beltrami. While glossily shot on location in Spain South Africa and England by Flavio Labiano the films larger setpieces dont always exploit their scenic backdrops as creatively as they might -- though a climactic chase through Barcelonas iconic La Monumental bullfighting ring does take the beast by the horns so to speak. (A closing-credits caveat acknowledging the citys 2012 ban on the sport further shows up the dated material.) With every principal player turning out to have more or less the precise agenda viewers will have suspected from the beginning the supporting cast goes strictly through the motions. Though he enjoys second billing Elba appears only at the 77-minute mark as an Interpol agent of initially ambiguous allegiance. His snappy presence is welcome though hes burdened with some of the films most cumbersome scripting -- chiefly a tortuous sustained metaphor about treehouses and termites that he and Penn lurch through with unaccountably straight faces. Potentially electrifying supporting players like Rylance and Bardem are given few notes to play that merely capable journeymen could not; in her first English-language film the usually luminous Trinca cant inject much gumption into a role that amounts to little more than passive ornamentation for the protagonist. For ""The Gunman"" has been conceived as Penns film through and through no matter how uncomfortably he carries it. Every move that a George Clooney might rakishly pull off -- say stealing a blazer from the back of a strangers chair en route to a dinner date -- Penn makes seem borderline sociopathic. Its his singular intensity and eccentricity as a performer that lends this otherwise form-following throwaway what unusual angles it has yet thats also the reason the film fails to work on its own beef-brained terms. ""Take care of your mind"" a doctor warns Terrier midway through the narrative; its sound advice too for the star whose notable prior credits behind the camera make this self-developed vehicle all the more surprising at this stage in an illustrious career.

Its an action movie and I enjoyed it for what it was. I was disappointed that Idris Elba only played a cameo role but overall I thought it was fine for the genre it represents. If you are not into action and enjoy seeing a really ripped body you can enjoy some of that too -) Reply Tripp says July 24 2015 at 315 pm I think it was a great movie Just a few things caught my eye with the flash bang and the claymore. The movie advisor for military stuff was probabally some cook. If your going to have "" special forces "" or mercenary type movie use an ex special forces or PMC like me advising your movie or guys like me will notice everything which makes the movie les believable. Critics are talking about Penn not beig ""humorous"" IT WASNT A HUMOROUS MOVIE and it isnt Fast times Sean Penn was great and did an awesome job. Reply stephanie rigney (catsandog) says May 22 2015 at 1013 pm I think this is a harsh account of this movie. It is definitely a love story and Sean Penns veiny biceps are illustrious throughout the movie...not something to balk at. So what hes 54-dont we all want to keep our youth Reply jj says March 23 2015 at 227 am Dont like his politics dont watch his movies...nuff said Reply axzl says April 24 2015 at 743 pm Glad to know youre an idiot. Reply RVEE says March 22 2015 at 1026 am What is the saying in the street ""Punk Bitch""? Thats what Sean Penn is Sean Penn has no business playing roles with any military theme. He is an insult to all those who served in American forces. Penn is passe Hollywood is desperate Love to run into this punk on the street sometime. Ill Tell him about war pain and PTS. A RECON guy from Nam Reply Jim says March 22 2015 at 400 am Review is spot on. Saw it yesterday. Sucked in by trailer and totally underwhelmed. Reply Phillip Pessar (PhotogPhillip) says March 21 2015 at 754 pm No surprise the movie turned out so crappy considering that Hugo Chavezs biggest fan is starring in it. Reply SPY says March 15 2015 at 237 pm another Hollywood HYPOCRITE THAT HUGO CHAVEZ LOVING ASSHOLE WOULD PROBABLY PISS HIS PANTS IF HE HAD TO GET INTO A REAL FIGHT if it involved anyone NOT holding a camera Reply Kezia says March 15 2015 at 1028 am Penn? Who cares. Ill see it because Idris and Javier are in it. Reply Eric says March 14 2015 at 201 am Penn is one of three actors whos films I have decided to boycott since they all three have come out against guns yet continue to make films involving the use of guns. Liam Neeson and Jamie Foxx are the other two. They are all three sellout hypocrites. Reply the SMFIC says March 12 2015 at 1016 am Ah yes quotable commie anti-freedom from dictators Sean Penn re-emerges from his self-imposed but universally loved decade long hiatus to pose as.........gun-toting everyman killer? Huh? Did this moron get the irony in that and just ignore it for a paycheck? Reply Jeff says March 8 2015 at 1102 pm Do not support this anti second amendment hypocrite. Reply Excel (NYCMemphis) says March 7 2015 at 413 am what a hypocrite Penn isgoes on an anti gun tyraide and then stars in a movie called the gunman..If you want to be a liberal anti gunner then why make movies about them..Oh wait I knowMONEY  Reply Macd says March 6 2015 at 1252 pm Sean Penns career has always been a mystery to me. Moviegoers avoid his films like the plague and the few times I had to deal with the surly little snot are not among my fondest memories. However this misbegotten attempt to fashion himself into a brawny middle-aged action star seems destined to provide one thing -- unintentional hilarity. Reply dhql says March 6 2015 at 245 pm As far as Sean Penns career was the first action hero of the water 5 times the Academy nominations and two Academy Awards in Venice Berlin and Cannes best actor Winner Award Due to the small delay in the film mainly received in spin art films This career is a mystery to you Reply Corey says July 2 2015 at 642 am The academy award is an award without integrity. Theyre so political and biased you have to be an associate colleague of the inner hollywood circle just to get one. I find it grossly ironic that Sean Penn is the one who was chosen to drop the bomb on Clint Eastwood at the academy awards best picure announcement where American Sniper was the elephant in the room by saying Its not about box office numbers... Then has the nerve to cast himself as a Navy Seal. Absurdly insulting. So what if he was nominated or even won? What box office numbers did he break or set in his career EVER? Oh yeah. None And the box office is where youre relevance is proven. Period. Kay says March 13 2015 at 1110 am What is a mystery to me is why he didnt get the Chris Brown treatment after a documented domestic abuse episode and all the other violent outbursts he had the late not as far as a year ago smashing a fans phone who took a pic of him at a public place. Hollywood is all bout connections and powerful friends ad so are Awards. Victor Snifalotapus says March 13 2015 at 1046 am He makes artsy fartsy garbage nobody likes but gets lots of accolades from smug movie critics other celebrities and people like dhql.

Daily Edition Login to download The Gunman Film Review 1100 AM PST 3/6/2015 by Leslie Felperin FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS This humorless action film becomes unintentionally camp by the end TWITTER In his first starring role in a few years Sean Penn plays a reformed mercenary trying to redeem himself in the latest from Taken director Pierre Morel Taking the lead protagonist role for a change instead of playing the villain (as in Gangster Squad) or a peripheral enigma (see The Secret Life of Walter Mitty or The Tree of Life) Sean Penn stars as a reformed hitman seeking redemption in the trite action film The Gunman. Takens Pierre Morel may be in the directors chair but Penn has credits as both a co-screenwriter and producer and ultimately this feels like a vanity project designed to do for Penns bankability Africa Spain and mercenaries what the Taken franchise did for Liam Neeson Paris and Albanian gangsters. Ripe borderline hammy turns from Javier Bardem Ray Winstone Idris Elba and Mark Rylance add some spice and box-office appeal but otherwise this is pretty boilerplate stuff that takes itself way too seriously. Ticket sales should be solid on the back of a vigorous marketing campaign but Penn is unlikely to have the same appeal as Neeson for the target demographic. The opening prologue set in 2006 establishes the bona fides of Penns character Jim Terrier as a tough guy with a soft spot for his idealistic doctor girlfriend Annie (Jasmine Trinca). These two crazy mixed-up kids are living together in the Democratic Republic of Congo where he toils by day for a security task force protecting mining operations and by night as a mercenary hitman for shadowy interests. When his associate Felix (Bardem) who has barely disguised hots for Annie assigns Terrier to assassinate the DCRs minister of mining (Clive Curtis) Jim has no choice but to leave the country - and Annie - behind immediately. The years and opening credits pass and now in the present Jim has come back to Africa this time to help the locals mine for themselves. And also it seems to surf which affords the audience one of several opportunities to ogle Penns gym-bunny abs. However one day in the jungle some heavies come looking for him. His fixer Eugene (Ade Oyefeso one of the only two black actors who has more than three lines here despite the amount of time spent in Africa) helps Jim to quell the threat but Jim realizes that the attack must have something to do with what happened in his past. Retrieving secret squirrel stashes of passports cash and weapons hidden around Europe he begins his quest to find out who put out the hit on the hitman by looking up old associates from his mercenary days. He starts in London (a glassy haze of riverside apartments and skyscrapers) where he first checks in with Cox (Mark Rylance still rocking the collar-length hair and shifty eyes from playing Cromwell in the BBC adaptation of Wolf Hall) a cynical former point man whos now gone semi-legit and an aging muscle-for-hire cor-blimey-guvnor-Cockney Stanley (Ray Winstone rocking greasy hair and a perpetually amused expression). They dont seem to know anything so next Jims off to Barcelona where Felix is now promoting non-specific business ventures in Africa to help the poor and is shacked up with Annie. Jim stalks her round town giving the film some time to bask in the Catalonian atmosphere and establish that she and Felix are planning to adopt a child before he finally gets up the courage to visit her. There are literally just seconds between her giving him the obligatory angry-woman slap and then pulling him into bed for some ex-sex. Later they grow even closer when he saves her from yet more angry hit guys who pounce when Jim comes to Annie and Felixs countryside mansion for lunch. Up until this point the casts natural charisma and talent is sufficient to maintain interest in the thinly written material credited to Penn Don MacPherson (The Avengers) and Pete Travis (Dredd) which pays lip service to the troubles in DRC via some news-footage montages and clunky explication. The political agenda doesnt mesh in a meaningful way with the soapier drama hinged on which unappealing man Annie will end up with -- the dead-eyed assassin or the sleazy businessman. But given that Trincas role is so underwritten its clear that the romance is of secondary interest to the filmmakers and ultimately shes merely a pawn in a game of macho action-movie chess shot by Flavio Labiano in the manner of the Bourne films with handheld rigs and grainy-looking stock. It all becomes even more of a slog once Jim and Annie start schlepping around Spain on the lam visiting Gibraltar for the big entirely predictable reveal as to who is the real villain and then back to Barcelona for a climactic showdown at a bullfighting ring (despite the fact that Catalonia banned the sport in 2012). But legal history be damned; its a picturesque setting for a chase sequence with all those crowds corridors and dangerous livestock. Somewhere along the way Elba lurches into view as an Interpol agent who wants to help Jim although the need for discretion is apparently so great he has to couch his offer of assistance in a torturous overextended metaphor about building a treehouse that seems so coy and circumlocutory youd think theyd set up the rendezvous through Grindr. The scene tips the movie into camp and by the end it becomes something of a giggle-fest surely not the intended aim of the filmmakers.

Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales Starts Production Unveils Premise EuropaCorp Q3 Revenue Spikes on Taken 3 DVD Release of Lucy Oscar winner aims at both social commentary and post-""Taken"" viability in this predictable thriller Film history will one day mark ""Taken"" as the ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" of the new millennium -- the latter movie gave ignored actresses of a certain age new big-screen opportunities as ax-wielding murderesses and now the former is spawning a whole new sub-genre of middle-aged actors picking up guns in the hopes of getting the same career boost that Liam Neeson has enjoyed. The latest to lock and load is Sean Penn in ""The Gunman"" and while the film makes a few stabs at selling us on Sean Penn Global Humanitarian its real agenda (Penn was a co-writer and co-producer) is to offer up Sean Penn Viable Action Star. He surfs he showers and he has sex for reasons that have more to do with showing the actor shirtless than they do with advancing the plot. See Video Sean Penn Is an American Sniper Making the Biggest Mistake of His Life in The Gunman Trailer (Video) That plot -- by Don MacPherson Pete Travis and Penn -- could use all the help it can get since what begins and ends as an exploration of Western exploitation of the Congos mineral resources and the havoc that it wreaks upon the natives mostly follows the standard track of the retired hit-man who realizes that he hasnt quite yet eluded the sins of the past. We open in the Congo of 2006 where Jim (Penn) is supposedly helping to build an airfield while providing security for NGO aid workers; hes madly in love with surgeon Annie (Jasmine Trinca ""The Best of Youth"") but director Pierre Morel (""Taken"") cuts five or six times to Jims colleague Felix (Javier Bardem in a rare terrible performance) glowering at them so we get the message that Felix loves her too. Jim and Felix are actually part of a team of assassins who are there to take out the Minister of Mining who wants to cancel all the foreign contracts in the country; Felix gets to decide who will be the shooter -- as well as the fact that the shooter must immediately leave Africa -- so naturally he picks Jim. Also Read Birdman Oscar Winner Alejandro Inarritu on Sean Penns Controversial Green Card Joke I Found It Hilarious Cut to 2014 where Jim has returned to the Congo to dig wells until one day three armed locals show up to kill him. Jim realizes hes a target so he dashes off to London to meet up with other former team members Cox (Mark Rylance) and Stanley (Ray Winstone). All roads lead back to Barcelona where Felix is now married to the unhappy Annie (who for reasons unknown now teaches grammar school rather than practice medicine). Cue the chasing and the shooting and the exploding up to a big finale at -- what the heck were in Spain -- a bullfight. One intriguing plot twist introduced early on is Jims declining health with symptoms similar to early-onset Alzheimers his dangerous lifestyle having led to an accumulation of deadly plaque on his brain. The idea of a man who will die if he doesnt avoid stress exertion and loud noises -- only to be pursued by men who will kill him unless he fights them off thus facing stress exertion and loud noises -- is a potentially fascinating premise that ""The Gunman"" couldnt care less about. The brain business is introduced in act one and then basically forgotten until the climax. If the scenes in the Congo are meant to inject some kind of social consciousness into a shoot-em-up they dont -- the Africa subplot comes off like such an afterthought that its a MacGuffin at best. See Video Jimmy Kimmels School of Perfect Acting Outtakes as Funny as Sketch Itself (Video) ""The Gunman"" does at least offer perpetual forward motion; once Jim realizes hes in danger theres not a lot of pausing to reflect and whatever second-unit director was in charge of helicopter shots more than earned his or her keep. Even with heavyweights like Penn and Rylance the acting is mostly negligible although Winstone and Idris Elba (as an INTERPOL agent) add some spark to their fleeting moments onscreen while Peter Franzen who looks like a Eurotrash-assassin version of onetime MTV host Dave Holmes brings genuine menace to his fight scenes with Penn. Does this movie herald Penn as the next 50-something action star? Hard to say; its one thing to bring a gravelly gravitas to characters like this but Penn suffers and glowers so much that it weighs down the material. If he plans to strap on the Kevlar in future he might consider lightening up a little and saving the intensity for more serious movies.
