J. Abrams infuses the latest installment of George Lucass intergalactic franchise with the spirit of Steven Spielberg in this awestruck warmhearted and good-humored action spectacle. Its centered on the search for Luke Skywalker by the organized Resistance to the evil dominion of the First Order. That oppressive successor to the Empire wants to extinguish the last of the Jedi whose help the Resistance fighters need. Abrams recruits a remarkable new posse of actors--including Oscar Isaac John Boyega Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver--to play a batch of new characters yet for all their flair and presence they have little acting to do (though Driver shines in his moment of theatrical excess). Abrams who co-wrote the script with Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt stage-manages some breathlessly clever plotting but he also plays every gesture and every gag every sigh and every whoop to the balcony and he milks decades of nostalgia with the stagy entrances of Carrie Fisher Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill. Some of the grandest moments can be seen coming around the corner the colossal battles and colorful catastrophes feel anticlimactic and the meticulously designed futuristic weaponry and outfits never rise to symbolic significance. Despite the copious servings of tragic threats and good feelings the production sinks under the weight of its emotional calculation.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

J. Abrams feels young and as an act of pure storytelling it streams by with fluency and zip.   Credit Photograph by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / Lucasfilm Ltd. / Courtesy Everett O.K. spoilers first. The Millennium Falcon is back although one character dismisses it as ""garbage"" and you still dont need an ignition key to start it. The Death Star has been replaced by what appears to be its elder brother and at one point we see the two of them rendered as holograms side by side. Great balls of firepower And the biggest news of all Chewbacca has had his highlights done just for the occasion. Theres definitely a new and strokeable touch of golden-blond about him. And why? Because hes worth it. ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" is as the title suggests aimed squarely at anyone who was worried that the Force was asleep on the job. Not that you can blame it for dozing off. One virtue of the new film is that it encourages viewers to ask afresh What is the Force exactly? I always assumed it was something that George Lucas dreamed up after too many Tolkien-themed parties at U.S.C. Like the One Ring the Force can be wielded for both good and evil ends but then so can a set of screwdrivers. We learn from this latest installment that the Force moves through all living things which sounds lovely if a trifle nebulous yet the uses to which people put it in the course of the narrative seem highly specialized and precise. For instance if you find yourself shackled to a torture rack in the stronghold of your enemy you can brainwash your guard into releasing your fetters and leaving the door open. Very handy. Better yet if the hilt of your light sabre is partially buried in snow and you cant reach it the Force--manifesting itself as a superior wobble--can pull the weapon out for you like a splinter from your thumb. Needless to say that simple motion will incite seat-dampening delirium among fans of the franchise who will need no reminding that Luke Skywalker performed the same trick near the start of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" when he found himself dangling upside-down in an ice cave with his sabre stuck beyond his grasp and a shaggy white carnivore preparing to treat him as Carpaccio of Jedi. The new film is studded with details of that sort as if the primary duty of the director J. J. Abrams were to reassure devotees that all is well and that whatever his frenzy of innovation much remains the same in their favorite galaxy. It is decreed say that when two major characters who have prowled around each other at a distance finally meet for a showdown it should take place on a thin spindle of bridge above a gulping abyss. Anything less grand will not suffice. If you really think that a hero under ""Star Wars"" rules is permitted to sit down and confront his nemesis over a cup of coffee as Al Pacino did with Robert De Niro in ""Heat"" youre in the wrong game. The plot of ""The Force Awakens"" is itself an exercise in loyalty. Start with an eager but thwarted youngster toiling away in the sands of an unregarded planet? Check. End pretty much with an eager and unthwarted pilot zooming down the narrow canyon of a spaceship with his wingmen taking hits on his behalf and a tiny yet crucial target in his sights? Check. In short we are back where it all began clinging to the form of ""Star Wars"" (1977)--or as it was later rebaptized ""A New Hope."" Whats going on here? Is Abrams a chronic nostalgist bowing so low to the fan base that his nose is rubbing against the floor? Or has he wisely concluded that if it aint broke he should not be fool enough to fix it? All of the above and more. ""The Force Awakens"" is many things a reboot a tribute a valeting service and above all a wrestling match so adroitly wrought that lovers of the original may not even notice the skill with which Abrams pins down the object of their love and where necessary puts it out of action. I hate to say it but hes a critic--as all creators and especially re-creators must necessarily be. And hes ruthless. Airtime on his watch is not index-linked to the graying memories of baby boomers but doled out in line with dramatic appeal; the more vexing you were back in 1977 the less welcome you are now. Those of us who were resolutely uncharmed by R2-D2 and C-3PO for instance regarding them as just another of those squabbling couples whom you cant help hearing through the bedroom wall will be pleased to learn that their presence in ""The Force Awakens"" is strictly cameo-sized. Also what is the first thing we read as the opening titles snail their way up the screen? ""Luke Skywalker has vanished."" Good. Chipper yet irritating like a pet squirrel he was always the most insubstantial figure in the saga played by the most callow of the actors. So he has to go. Yet Luke still has one destiny to fulfill he must become an invisible hinge of the story. Everyone in ""The Force Awakens"" is trying to get hold of BB-8 a small rolling droid who appears to have wandered in from a Pixar short and who unlike R2-D2 is physically able to descend a flight of stairs. (Ascent is another matter; no wonder we dont witness the attempt.) Lodged inside BB-8 on a sort of memory stick is a segment of galactic map which when added to the rest of the jigsaw will show--either to reverential followers or to vengeful foes--where Skywalker is. Whether and why hes worth tracking down is never asked; the quest is what counts. If you had told King Arthur that the Holy Grail was in fact a 6.95 highball glass from Crate amp; Barrel do you think he would have dismounted from his steed and stayed behind to play gin rummy on the Round Table? He would not. Taking Lukes seat as the main protagonist is Daisy Ridley. She straps herself in swats aside any vestige of Mark Hamill and takes command of the movie. Her character is Rey a scrap-metal scavenger by trade stranded without a family on the dusty planet of Jakku. ""Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth"" she says with the calm assurance of someone who knows herself to be solid flesh and blood. Frankly she is twice the guy he ever was. Ridley is given plenty to do before she even delivers a line proof not just that Abrams trusts her but that his obedience to the basic laws of action movies is intact. (We first saw it in ""Super 8"" which also had a female presence Elle Fanning at its core. ""Women always figure out the truth"" we hear in the new movie. George Lucas look and learn.) Our first glance of any new performer watching simply how she or he walks across the screen can be more instructive than anything else--far more than the utterance of dialogue. Ridley has a firm gait a determined sprint and a talent for ad-hoc sand sledding and Rey needs no help from anyone thank you very much. ""Stop taking my hand"" she cries fleeing a fracas in the company of a stranger. At first the stranger has no name though he soon acquires one. Finn (John Boyega) turns out to be an Imperial Stormtrooper with a conscience. I must admit I never realized that such tender beings existed. Its as though a member of the Hitler Youth had volunteered for Meals on Wheels. Anyway off comes his helmet and Boyega gives a fine demonstration of moral relief as the sweaty burden of malice is lifted from his soul. Such at least is one reading of the scene; the expression on his face could equally be that of a grown man who no longer has to jog around in one of those white plastic codpieces which never look quite as shatterproof as the wearer would like them to be. Not for a second as a teen-ager was I spooked by the Stormtroopers and Abrams I suspect feels the same which is why he dedicates one of the earliest shots in his movie to refurbishing their image--showing them all in a row under lighting that flickers like a strobe. Just for once they seem to be something other than outsize toys although even Abrams cant do much about the Millennium Falcon which struck me decades ago as little more than a Lego kit waiting to happen. And what of its proud owner? In contrast to Luke Han Solo still armed with his lopsided sigh of a smile resumes his spot on center stage in ""The Force Awakens"" and rightly so for the franchise owes so much to Harrison Ford. Without him and Alec Guinness after all the first ""Star Wars"" would have been largely unwatchable; viewed again earlier this week it came across as startlingly inept--barely written often badly acted and always poorly paced with some sequences tumbling past in an embarrassed rush and others lingering like unwanted guests. Granted the result made hundreds of millions of dollars and acquired the patina of legend but still ""Star Wars"" was emotionally as null as the interstellar void through which its vessels leaped. That gratuitous round of applause at the end for the returning saviors and thus by implication for the movies own bravado? I blocked my ears. And the comedy? Dont make me laugh. Ford alone took the measure of the nonsense around him and saw instinctively how it might flourish; his lazy sprawl and his grumbling asides encouraged the audience to step back and inspect the striving of other life forms and other civilizations from a laconic angle. He understood as Bogart did before him that a half-reluctant hero with a fondness for cash payments is sexier and more plausible than any pink-cheeked enthusiast who gets turned on by the dream of doing good. Ford became the ironist of junk. Hence his conversation in ""The Force Awakens"" with Carrie Fisher who turns up once again as Princess Leia still unfazed but minus the cinnamon roll of hair glued onto each ear. Solo says ""Wasnt all bad was it? Some of it was""--a loaded pause--""pretty good."" Leia ponders. ""Some of it"" she says. I like to think that Abrams had a similar chat on the sly with Lawrence Kasdan one of his co-writers on the project. (Michael Arndt also gets a credit.) It was Kasdan of course who worked on ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Return of the Jedi"" and yet his efforts here suggest not so much a tour of the old galactic homestead as a step into another well-known terrain. With Kasdan and Ford back in harness together as they were for ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" almost thirty-five years ago ""The Force Awakens"" feels closer to Indiana Jones than it does to Lucass ""Star Wars."" (Solo to Rey and Finn ""Escape now. Hug later."" Indy to a T.) By temperament Abrams is more of a Spielbergian than he is a Lucasite. His visual wit may not be as it is for Spielberg a near-magical reflex but nor is Abrams suckered into bombast by technological zeal as Lucas has been and the new movie as an act of pure storytelling streams by with fluency and zip. To sum up ""Star Wars"" was broke and it did need fixing. And here is the answer. The new film also feels young. That may sound strange given the grizzled and sardonic heft that Ford brings to the party but his role has an elegiac strain too and he knows it. You can sense him passing the torch without a fuss to Ridley and Boyega who is vivacious and affable from first to last; and also to Adam Driver who plays Kylo Ren--the winner of the Best Black Mask amp; Cape Award in ""The Force Awakens"" Darth Vader having presumably retired to spend less time with his family. So well is Driver cast against type here that evil may turn out to be his type and so extraordinary are his features long and quiveringly gaunt that even when he removes his headpiece you still believe that youre gazing at some form of advanced alien. The world of ""Girls"" seems far far away. Ren sports a funky brand of light sabre too which blazes devil red not merely along the length of the blade but also athwart the cross-guard so that he appears to be swishing a giant scarlet crucifix like a vampire taking on his hunters. One battle in particular is a feast for the ears as well as the eyes for it unfolds in a wintry forest. In addition to the usual throbbing hum of the weapons (jazzed up a little for this movie I fancy) you can hear the sizzle of sabre on snow and the slicing hiss as the fighters miss their target and fell surrounding pine trees by mistake. This is something I do not recall from previous chapters in the franchise genuine cinematic texture allowing the film however briefly to be felt rather than merely enjoyed--or endured--as a thunderous volley of sensations. That doesnt happen often enough in ""The Force Awakens""; when Rey arrives at a verdant land for the first time (""I didnt know there was so much green in the whole galaxy"") she is allowed only one deep breath before Abrams cuts it short and moves on. But his registering of scale is delicately done with bodies dwarfed by cavernous structures or natural hills and vales and you can feel him struggling to remind us as Lucas and the other directors never bothered to do that making wars among the stars is by definition the last word in futility and folly. Everyone is wasted by space. It is not for that reason however that I salute your courage in going to see ""The Force Awakens."" Something more urgent than metaphysics is at issue namely this paying to watch a new ""Star Wars"" movie in the wake of its predecessors--""The Phantom Menace"" ""Attack of the Clones"" and ""Revenge of the Sith""--is like returning to a restaurant that gave you severe food poisoning on your last three visits. So be of good cheer. ""The Force Awakens"" will neither nourish nor sate but it is palatable and fresh and it wont lay you low for days to come. Worshippers of the older films will have every right to feel cosseted and spoiled as random exclamations--""Weapon fully charged in thirty seconds"" ""Itll take a miracle to save us now"" ""Lets hit that oscillator with everything weve got""--echo through the cinema like the barks of excited dogs. Heretics and infidels like myself will be gratified to have avoided a more parlous fate. Please forgive us if we snort into our sodas when Han Solo remarks ""The Dark Side the Jedi--its true. All of it."" Actually Han its not. Its baloney. But its fun to behold for now. And how long is it until the next chunk a spin-off titled ""Rogue One A Star Wars Story"" crash-lands at a movie theatre near you? One year. The Force is with us forever whether we like it or not.

"Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Star Wars Episode VII -- The Force Awakens Posted by Christy Lemire on December 20 2015 32 Comments Walt Disney Pictures. PG-13 for sci-fi action violence. Running time 135 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. You guys have all seen ""Star Wars Episode VII -- The Force Awakens"" by now right? So I can go ahead and wallow in all the spoilers? Actually I wouldnt dream of it. Not here at least. (If youre interested in a spoiler discussion after youve seen the movie though feel free to hop on over to our What the Flick? review.) But I did want to write a little something just because I loved the movie so much and Ive had such a good time over the past few days talking about it with folks -- those who had and hadnt seen it alike. I had the pleasure of bringing Nicolas (whos 6) with me to a screening on Tuesday afternoon at the Disney lot. Those of you who know me or have read my previous posts about ""Star Wars"" know that my kid is obsessed. I showed him all six films -- in release order of course because Im a good mom -- back when he was 4 1/2 years old. Since then hes dressed as Darth Vader for Halloween carried various ""Star Wars"" lunchboxes to school each day romped about with his collection of light sabers and played countless hours of the Angry Birds iPad game. I was more excited for him than I was for myself; hed only seen the movies at home on television so this would be his first time watching one in a packed theater with all the excitement and ritual that entails. He sat in my lap the whole time and was transfixed -- although he did ask who Han Solo and Princess Leia were when they came on screen for the first time. (Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher look a little different than they did 32 years ago in ""Return of the Jedi."" It happens to us all.) But even before the film began just during that brief silent pause between the words ""A long time ago in a galaxy far far away ..."" and the first blast of John Williams stirring fanfare there was a palpable sense of anticipation and even reverence. This mattered no matter how old you are. And J.J Abrams didnt disappoint. He actually exceeded my expectations of what this experience would be like -- and it truly is an experience on both a cultural and an emotional level and not just your everyday Saturday night at the multiplex. When Abrams was handed the franchise the expectation was that he would return it to the glory of the the original trilogy. If anybody could it was this director. And he did. Working from a script he co-wrote with Lawrence Kasdan (who also wrote the best film in the series ""The Empire Strikes Back"") and ""Toy Story 3"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" writer Michael Arndt Abrams beautifully combined the elements of the first three films that we loved so much with a fresh sense of purpose. Characters images themes and even lines of dialogue that make the ""Star Wars"" lore so rich co-exist seamlessly with new faces and adventures and a revitalized energy. It also blends much-ballyhooed practical effects with the best of what crisp and shiny computer-generated imagery can achieve. ""The Force Awakens"" flat-out dazzles filled with a wide variety of perfectly-paced set pieces. Again I dont want to give too much away but theres a chase involving the Millennium Falcon zooming through the remnants of a crashed star destroyer thats the most thrilling sequence Ive ever seen in the entire series. And yes that includes the climactic destruction of the Death Star in ""Star Wars."" This is not hyperbole. But speaking of the original film -- yes a lot of what we see here is awfully familiar but with enough tweaks to provide some novelty. Youll notice that I havent mentioned the plot in the slightest but theres a desert planet where a droid (the adorably perky BB-8 arriving just in time for Christmas) is entrusted with secret information. Theres a cantina where various intergalactic freaks meet to mingle and menace (although this time the owner is a woman played by Lupita Nyongo in a vivid bit of motion-capture performance). Theres a giant planet that destroys other planets but also has an Achilles heel that makes it vulnerable to an X-wing attack. And theres snappy banter between Han and Leia only now theyre older and filled with regret which adds a sense of wistfulness to their exchanges. As for the newcomers Adam Driver provides real depth and inner conflict as Kylo Ren Dark Side head honcho and leader of a new evil empire known as the First Order. The black helmet cape and mechanized voice may all seem familiar but once again we know the whole film aims for a different perspective when it allows the character to reveal his face and true identity. That element of humanity actually makes Kylo Ren even scarier. John Boyega is enormously charismatic as Finn a disillusioned Stormtrooper who must figure out what he believes in and then choose to find the strength to fight for it. If youre one of the few who saw ""Attack the Block"" you know what a pleasing screen presence this young British actor has. Now the whole world will now. And I love the fact that the massively versatile Oscar Isaac has such a crucial meaty supporting role as bad-ass pilot Poe Dameron. In the past few years hes shown he can really play any kind of character in any kind of film from ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" to ""A Most Violent Year"" to ""Ex Machina."" (Isaacs ""Ex Machina"" co-star Domhnall Gleeson whos also been all over the place lately is chilling as the First Orders military czar.) Now Isaac brings his formidable acting chops to the biggest blockbuster imaginable and provides it with even more substance. But this is Daisy Ridleys movie all the way. She is just a superstar. Its as simple as that. As the plucky heroine Rey a resourceful scavenger who discovers abilities she never knew she had she has an electrifying presence but also a down-to-Earth accessibility. Its a tricky balancing act she pulls off a mixture of daring and vulnerability smarts and openheartedness. We now have a ""Star Wars"" movie for a whole new generation in which the central figure is a woman -- and a strong woman at that. Rey never needs to be rescued. Shes the one doing the rescuing. Ridley has excellent chemistry not only with her fellow newcomers but also with veterans Ford and Fisher. Fellow old friends Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) C3-PO (Anthony Daniels) and even R2-D2 are welcome sights once more with Chewie enjoying a significant and even poignant storyline this time. ""The Force Awakens"" is a complete blast but it also features real stakes which woefully were missing from most of George Lucas duly derided prequels (although ""Star Wars Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith"" was actually pretty good). A dramatically lighted scene on a catwalk is a prime example of this; again I wouldnt dream of divulging what happens in this moment but I will say that its familiarity in no way diminishes its power. Thats whats so impressive about the tricky balancing act Abrams has pulled off with ""The Force Awakens"" Hes made a movie thats simultaneously gripping and a huge release. We are in good hands at last. Tweet Category Reviews Tags action Adam Driver Anthony Daniels Carrie Fisher Daisy Ridley Domhnall Gleeson George Lucas Harrison Ford J.J.

Episode VII has all the elements I would have liked in a new Star Wars movie except a worthy reason to bring these old characters back for more heartache after they beat the empire in Episode VI and were suppossed to have lived happily ever after. And for what? To fight a new ""Emperor"" (Snoke) whose light years away from being as scary as Palpatine and a new Darth of sorts (Keylo Ren) an overgrown teenager with daddy/grandaddy issues whos defeated by a relatively small girl (obviously the daughter of another Jedi) who has received no training whatsoever. I also found the movies grand twist horribly dissappointing Han Solo. one of the greatest action heroes in movies deserved so much better a death scene (think Judi Dench in ""Skyfall""). At any rate after failing to understand why so many critics disliked the terrific ""Spectre"" last month I find myself ever more clueless on why they did apprecaite Episode VII. Ill tell you one thing its a lot better to find yourself liking something that others didnt instead of the other way around Merry Christmas Christy Reply December 20 2015  by  Jeremy     Agreed on every point. Reply December 20 2015  by  Rodrigo Mainardes     You forgot to mention that after all this time we have to see AGAIN a droid wandering in the desert with valuable information found by the would-be Jedi another death star coming to blow the rebel base and so on and so on. Cmon.... no fresh ideas at all? Reply December 23 2015  by  Geoff     I am so glad that I wasnt the only one thinking the exact same thing Reply December 21 2015  by  Jesse     You have some good points technically but I should point out the reason Rey was able to stack up to Kylo Ren was because he was heavily injured by Chewie in an earlier scene. We also see early in the movie that she knows how to fight with a weapon (beats the crap out of some bandits trying to steal her droid as Finn rushes to help her) so no training may be a stretch. Reply December 21 2015  by  Christy Lemire     I love it -- my sweet friend Gerardo stirring up trouble on my website (And Merry Christmas to you guys too.) Reply December 21 2015  by  Eric Celeste     You sound like you would be fun at parties. Reply June 16 2016  by  Durge     Sure he doesnt like a re-hash movie he must be boring as hell Imbecile. Reply December 23 2015  by  Geoff     I totally agree. Im trying to fathom just how a professional movie reviewer can write positively about a retread story that trots out just about every tired plotline from the old movies. WTF? I just walked out of the movie theater wanting to scream WTF Another Death Star type weapon? Are you Fing kidding me? Another Emperor type character another Darth Vader character another Tatooine planet? I mean I havent even scratched the surface on how stupid and unoriginal this plotline is. Pffffftt No respect for Abrams and ESPECIALLY no respect for reviewers that are calling this a good movie. It isnt. And I actually liked the new characters. If they only had a good plotline to work within this could have been great. Its not. Reply December 29 2015  by  Bobby jo     Youre not yelping. Reply January 9 2016  by  Charly     How come she liked this un original story line so much. Maybe she got paid by Disney? We all have seen this beforeanother droid with vital informationa guy that looks and sounds like vader but is notno reason to go onthis new movie is a disgrace to starwars. Reply December 20 2015  by  Jeremy N     Technically it was well executed. The score under delivered which was a first for John Williams. Daisy Ridley was fantastic. The story was lazy and uninspired. Its the first Star Wars movie where the plot was not advanced. This movie completely negated the original trilogy. The protagonists are right back in the same situation as Luke Han Lea Chewie and Ben from a New Hope. This movie couldnt have taken more than 15 minutes to write. Substitute the Empire for the First Order the Wall-E robot for R2D2 the Falcon crew for their kids Vader for Ren the Emperor for Voldernort the Death Star for the star killer and you have Episode 4. JJ Abrams has turned Star Trek into a generic action movie and has done the same for Star Wars. The prequels at least advanced the plot and had an original story. I could have written this script using a Star Wars Mad-Libs template for much cheaper. I hate I spent so much effort avoiding trailers because had I known this was a reboot and not an original story I wouldnt have been so dissapointed. Reply December 23 2015  by  Geoff     Spot on. These comments are SPOT ON I feel like Ripley in Aliens where she says ""Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away?"". I suppose if I had never seen A New Hope and Return of the Jedi I would probably like this movie. But I did see those movies. And they have pretty much the exact same plot as this one. I mean can you imagine being on the writing team for this movie. Did they have discussions like ""And this time well have an even bigger Death Star Weapon this time the size of a small planet so it will be even more dramatic"". I mean WTF Reply December 20 2015  by  Jason     Gerardo its hard to find you very imaginative when one of your gripes is that someone is ""defeated by a relatively small girl"" If Star Wars is about anything isnt about the fact that size and gender have nothing to do with the outcome of a struggle? Is your complaint really that the outcome of a battle in a galaxy far far away doesnt conform to your idea of who should win a physical confrontation? Youre not going to complain about the physical impossibilities of harvesting a stars energy to destroy other planets but you will about the girl holding her own in a fight? I dont know if theres hope for you if thats what you took from this film. But you should consider what it must be like for kids to watch this movie and gain a vision for overcoming adversity that is probably better than what you could have told them is possible. Reply December 21 2015  by  Gerardo Valero     SPOILERS I actually loved the Rey character but by having her defeat Kylo Ren with such ease and without any training the filmmakers effectively made the latter look like a wimp and considering hes suppossed to be the movies main villain and the one who gets to kill the great Han Solo this really ended up hurting the movie. Imagine if it had been Luke who ran into Darth Vader in the Death Star and easily defeated him. Would anybody still care for Vader after all these years? Episode VII lacks the truly great character of the earlier films like a Vader a Yoda an Obi Wan or a Palpatine. Heck I would have settled for a Count Dooku. Personally I feel that we owe George Lucas an apology it turns out that making a Star Wars movie is not as easy as it seems. Reply December 21 2015  by  Mike     BELOW THERE BE SPOILERS ________________________________________ Im not sure Id characterize the fight between Rey and Kylo Ren as an easy win for Rey. And besides they went through some pains (pun unintended) to show that Kylo had been hit by Chewies bowcaster was bleeding pretty badly and took a few lightsaber nicks from Finn before he fought Rey. Even so he was arrogant and overconfident (much like Anakin in Episode III I might add) and paid the price as a result. I do think its a bit odd that Rey could do the Jedi mind trick and use the force to retrieve a lightsaber without any training though. It may have been smarter for them to show Rey using the force (albeit unknowingly) earlier in the movie - say by making extraordinary jumps while scavenging and having a precognitive sense of when shes about to run into trouble. They sort of hint at this when she flies the Falcon but they probably could have played this up a bit more. As is it comes off like she goes from ordinary human to force-user in the space of a day with no training. In any event I think Kylo Ren is supposed to be an unformed and deeply flawed villain. In fact he is very much a dark-side version of Luke from Empire Strikes Back. Snoke makes it clear that Rens training is not complete and Ren is arrogant overconfident and prone to whining and temper tantrums. He gets his hand cut off as a result and needs to be rescued by General Hux. In Empire Yoda makes clear that Lukes training is not complete and Luke is whiny overconfident (""Youll find Im full of surprises"") and ruled by his emotions. He gets his hand chopped off as a result and needs to be rescued by Leia and Lando. I dont think any of this is a coincidence. Of course by the time of Return of the Jedi Luke is a bit of a badass. Id be shocked if Kylo Ren werent much more dangerous in the next two episodes. Reply December 23 2015  by  Geoff     Theres nothing wrong with a girl holding her own in a fight. But imagine if you will a teen girl in the Middle Ages with no sword training going up against a Templar Knight in a sword fight and winning. That is how ridiculous this is. If she use her own polearm weapon that would be more realistic. As it is its just stupid. I really love the idea of the character they just didnt do the actual treatment very well. Reply December 21 2015  by  Peter Gamba     If this was the ""first"" Star Wars movie I would applaud all of it - as this takes place 30 years after and contains too many parallels to the original trio I was greatly disappointed. Yes the new characters are well cast with the exception of Driver. I dont believe he has the range to be ominous. I look at regular life and say thirty years is a long time especially in a pseudo technologically advanced world. Same Tie Fighters same X-Wings same scenarios just doesnt cut the mustard on showing me a future. I could go on just suffice that the folks that believe this was everything it should have and could have been didnt see the same movie as I. Reply December 21 2015  by  Fan25     I have to agree with some of the commenters here. Daisy Ridleys character defeats Kylo Ren with no previous light saber training. Her transition to amateur jedi knight is too quick and I dont like it. That being said it is a solid film and I thoroughly enjoyed the shit out of it. Reply December 21 2015  by  Brian O Hanlon     Re Science Fiction Genre In discussing this movie the members of Christys panel went out of their way to distinguish between something called fantasy and something else called science fiction. This is shallow in my humble opinion. I think that the comparison with the character of Judi Dench in James Bond and that which Harrison Ford plays in Star Wars is a valid one. I dont know what genre that we would have to lump James Bond into - espionage thriller? Dunno. But the genre which all of these fall into is big box office movie and thats really about the size of it. There are a few very different takes on the future on science fiction that have been explored in cinema over the decades - and in my opinion they all deserve recognition - for the parts of science fiction that they do well. Ben Mankiewicz in his observations about this movie saw the value in this movie in the audience getting to know more about the world of a Storm Tropper - something which hadnt happened in earlier features by George Lucas. But then we think about this. We think about movies in the series Alien beginning with the original directed by Ridley Scott a long time ago (in another galaxy far away). Ben Mankiewicz mentioned that he would like to see Storm Troppers with their helmets off enjoying coffee break in the canteen. This is what Alien movie series was about. It introduces the audience into the domestic environment on a distant planet. It introduces us to people who sleep whilst making long distance travel. Alien introduces us to live on the space-aged frontier. It aint pretty it aint exciting. If all were going well life would continue to be boring - except for the intrusion of the Alien - the very same one that always manages to sneak into the cargo bay and hop from one galaxy to another - creating death and destruction in the process. Another more recent franchise in the science fiction part of the big movie spectrum - one like Riddick - picks up on some of the best parts of Alien. The idea of things climbing aboard space barges when they arent supposed to. The space or science fiction explored by these movies doesnt have any Mellenium Falcon. The space ships in a lot of science fiction movies are more like trucks that haul cargo across large distances. The places they visit are like road side truck stops. The characters who inhabit those places are work-a-day types. Its mundane. But somehow in the middle of it all these characters like Riddick and Ridley appeared and became unlikely heros of sorts. The original Star Wars had something of that. The individuals who became heros were unlikely ones. Han Solo for example had to be dragged kicking and screaming into making a commitment to any cause or any greater mission. Both Riddick and Ridley were also selfish characters in some ways. Matt Atchity refers to this as a character arc I think. And his observation of the most recent Star Wars episode may have truth to it. We wonder if the new Star Wars heros come a little bit too pre-packaged and dont have to struggle enough to finally become the heros that they become. I mean in the old Star Wars six and half a dozen the Han Solo character flies off in his Mellenium Falcon closing the hatch behind him - and leaves Ben Kenobi Princess Leia Luke and the whole shutting match - on the planet behind him to be chewed alive by Darth Vader or whomever. Thats what Han Solo started out as - and we saw his character undergo a transformation over the series. But why stop at Alien or Riddick? Heck Id even throw the Matrix or even Terminator in there too for good measure. Because those movies also contribute something into the canon of science fiction and movies in the broadest sense. It just happens that the Matrix and Terminator are very planet Earth-centric in their story lines. However that doesnt seem to prevent their stories from seeming terribly important and futuristic and exciting. The important point I think is to understand how some new movies - in the examples of Riddick and the Matrix - have managed to re-invent the science fiction genre in very fresh and exciting ways. I cant help but thinking when I look at movies like those - that that is where Star Wars ought to have been - on a similar kind of bleeding edge of movie making and science fiction. However because Star Wars hasnt been able to explore that bleeding edge a lot of these other worlds and other characters have been created. I think that the point that Ben Mankiewicz may have managed to stumble across in the panel reviews of this movie - is that there is scope within Star Wars - for it to become more like Alien or more like the Matrix or Riddick. There is scope to try out those experiments with Star Wars and not have it damage the original concept in any way. And now that I think of it I wonder why Star Wars has not managed to produce some kind of kick ass machine bad-guy - in the way that Terminator has been able to do. When I think about it now Ive seen at least a dozen bad-guy robots of one sort or another in George Lucas movies - and I dont remember any of them - like I remember some of the ones that have appear in Terminator. Why is that? Why cant a robot (Darth Vader was an example of what I mean more robot than anything else) in a Star Wars movie be something that wont go away - like they are in Terminator? Why do robots only really kick ass in Terminator - and not so much in Star Wars? And why cant something other than a human being be the leading character - as in the case of Riddick? Why is Star Wars so reluctant to go there? One of the strengths of earlier Star Wars was its willingness to place something like Jabba the Hutt as a leading character in the middle of the plot. All best B. Reply December 21 2015  by  Phoebe     I wonder if I can find a review that praises the new film and doesnt trash the prequels. Apparently not. The film was absolutely fantastically great though unoriginal. The review was also great. Except for the quip against my favorite films in the series. -_- Reply December 22 2015  by  Jim     Christy First thanks for the forum and the review. Like many others here I have to say that I have mixed feelings with the movie. It DID stay true to the original and I enjoyed it but there are an awful lot of plot holes and inconsistencies. I appreciate the new charecters and think theyll be great in upcoming releases but the story line was disappointing and unimaginative. I would have liked to see some forward development (technologically) and had a bit more revealed about why and HOW the old empire managed not only to survive but THRIVE in the new Republic and build an even bigger and badder super weapon??? Why are the rebels and Republic separate? ODD... Our favorite heros have obviously been through some tough times but here too I see obvious parallels. Children seperated at birth...siblings perhaps? A new emperor and apprentice...Kylo. An absent Jedi master... Again...great job at reviving the originals but a bit too predictable and sadly...unispiring. Theres some great story there waiting to be uncovered and I anxiously await the next one in the franchise to see if theyll be revealed. If your a fan youll enjoy the movie and the return to that galaxy far far away. Just dont exspect too many insights into the how why and where. Reply December 22 2015  by  Doug McWilliams     Spot on review Really well done. I completely agree. This was a great movie Reply January 22 2016  by  Greg     Ditto Reply December 23 2015  by  - Jon -     I found the movie lacking any creative talent whatsoever. It failed to capture any of the grandeur of the original trilogy and felt more like a budget movie in size and scope rather than a 200 million dollar behemoth. The plot... well I am still trying to figure out if there was one. The backstory of what happened since Return of the Jedi and current day is beyond vague. Its like Disney spent 4 billion dollars acquiring the rights to Star Wars but forgot to hire any talented writers. This could have been huge and Disney blew it as far as I am concerned. I will not go blindly to see the second movie. In fact I am probably not going to go see it at all. I love what JJ Abrams did with the second Star Trek film but this is just pathetic. Reply December 24 2015  by  Brian O Hanlon     Commentator above writes  ""Theres nothing wrong with a girl holding her own in a fight. But imagine if you will a teen girl in the Middle Ages with no sword training going up against a Templar Knight in a sword fight and winning"". Good analogy I think. In this future galaxy which Star Wars depicts this thing of medieval swordsmanship Samurai like code and greatness with the weapon - is a key part of the culture. It was present in greater or lesser measure in all Star Wars episodes. Its not as if writers and directors of George Lucas movies havent enough material to draw upon. There exists the whole canon of Samurai stories characters and movies made down through the years. But somehow Star Wars manages to feel that it is above and beyond borrowing hints and lessons from the best movie making - outside of Star Wars. For my money Ill know that the George Lucas folk have got back on track when I see the following. When I can watch a new Star Wars movie where some electronic intelligence or Dark Force imbued robot manages to create havoc in the Republic and threaten its survival. And at that stage the Jedi are literally sent packing across the galaxies - in search of some solution - or some intelligence (perhaps a human derivative or fork like the Furian in the Riddick series) that is able to deal with the big bad machine. That is where the Matrix series went I think - and managed to do it convincingly. There are a lot of elements present in Star Wars which would lead Star Wars to be able to explore these avenues. But the folk who make Star Wars movies pretend that science fiction has not moved on since the 1950s. They pretend that audiences who watch Star Wars dont watch other stuff too. Stuff like Riddick Matrix Alien Terminator etc. The writers and directors have never had a confidence or a courage to attempt to go down that path - more is the pity. Reply December 26 2015  by  Runner 5     Lets not be so hasty to lambaste this one for retooling old plot devices. The central moment of the film (the cantina encounter where both Rey and Finn face a choice take up the fight or run from it) all but lectures us that those who live long enough will see history repeating itself. Its for the filmmakers to deliver on these obvious repetitions in some deeper way than simply playing them out as a hit parade for uncritical fans and we have yet to see whether they will successfully do so. They have set enough in motion to make something interesting of the persistent moral and cosmic themes embodied in the original trilogy and now we get to see if it happens. I did feel these repetitions took some uncritical fandom for granted and were often rushed into action rather than deeply fleshed out. If the later films back up a bit and add some substance it could be a great success. Reply December 27 2015  by  Brian O Hanlon     Commentator writes  ""I did feel these repetitions took some uncritical fandom for granted and were often rushed into action rather than deeply fleshed out"". Agreed. What the first second and third have (from 77 80 and 83 respectively) is the benefit of not having built up a franchise to an extent that it exists today. Star Wars back then still had to fight for its own corner. In the late seventies and early eighties Star Wars did not have the same captive audience that it has now. If Im honest about it probably the best thing that happened Star Wars was the failure of the trilogy in the 2000s which has prompted serious re-evaluation of how to make a decent Star Wars feature length film. It was almost by the 2000s the original creators had forgotten it themselves. But it happens. A documentary about the music group from Scandinavia Abba interviewed a lot of the old members of that group I recall. And even when they set forth to create a musical for stage based on the music that they had created themselves decades earlier - they found it difficult to understand - how the formula had worked. The truth is is that directors music writers and artists are all very different people in middle age compared to the people they were when they were in the fullness of their youth. All one has to do is look at old photos of the set of Star Wars from the late seventies and early eighties - and one just knows - here are a bunch of people who are in the best form of their lives. They werent locked up inside of office parks busy making stuff move around on a computer screen. They were in the thick of it where the physical action really takes place. I listened to actor Jeremy Renner discuss this too in relation to his first performance in the new Bourne franchise - a similar thing where that movie brand or franchise - is working hard to establish some new direction for itself after the success of the three Matt Damon features. Renners observation was that the success of Bourne had to do a lot with the high portion of physical live footage that was incorporated into the movie and the story telling. And Renner who has worked in the industry now for a while - makes the point that fewer movies nowadays - see it appropriate to spend the kind of budget needed to achieve that real life camera work. It was disappointing however to listen to the panels review of The Revenant which went to considerable lengths to capture real life footage and lighting. However Ill wait to see that movie to pass my own judgement but I am looking forward to it. Reply December 27 2015  by  Brian O Hanlon     Just as a side note. I had seen the movie The Fifth Estate (2013) not so long ago. I went back and viewed the panels What the Flick review of The Fifth Estate. I think that Bens contribution to that review contained something relevant. The movie The Fifth Estate spends an awful lot of time plane hopping around the continents and across the world. True this idea of geographical connectivity and media in a modern time is part of the story about Julian Assange and Wiki Leaks. But the point is is that the physical action and different locations connect back to the story telling in the Bourne movie series. For some reason in The Fifth Estate which received an appallingly low score from all of the critics on the panel - Bens point was correct I think. The Fifth Estate spends a lot of time moving around different cities airports different countries. But rather than support the story it ends up becoming an annoying distraction. Bens comment about Star Wars was also interesting. While the earlier movies from the 70s and 80s did give some idea of the size of galaxies and we traveled around in them a little - Bens point was that in the current movie - space felt much smaller. One of the best things about the old Star Wars even though the effects and stunts were probably basic (Matt Atchity noted how the old Light Sabre fight scenes did not look terribly dramatic) in the original Star Wars the audience did get a little sense of traveling through different planets and galaxies. If one were to choose between having poor Light Sabre battles or having a sense of scale to the universe in which the Star Wars characters play their roles - many people would probably choose the later. Probably one of the best features of movie franchises like Battlestar Galactica perhaps and to a large extent Riddick Pitch Black etc - is that it gives an audience the sense of the scale of space - and the remoteness of some of the planets where action can take place. Alien manages to do that too in its sequels. Heck even a movie like Gladiator about ancient Rome makes one feel like the world was an awful lot larger from a personal travel and movement point of view than it is now. In that sense science fiction and movies about the future dont take us into the future. Instead they have a way of taking us back into our past. B.

A caped and cowled villain in a black helmet seduced by the Dark Side. A lost droid beeping and chirping the urgency of its secret message for the rebellion. An apprentice turned against his master. A son turned against his father. Related Story The Ballad of Admiral Piett If these elements recall for you George Lucass original Star Wars trilogy well thats exactly what theyre supposed to do. Star Wars The Force Awakens J. J. Abramss much-anticipated reboot of the franchise is in many ways less sequel than remix a loving mashup of familiar scenes characters themes and dialogue. ""I have lived long enough to see the same eyes in different people"" explains one character. Anyone watching the film is likely to feel much the same way.Of course fans of the franchise are also granted the opportunity to see the same eyes in the same people as the movie reunites the original castmates Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill in their iconic roles of yesteryear. In movie-time as well as real-time more than 30 years have passed since Return of the Jedi. And while neither Fisher nor Hamill is given a great deal to do Ford proves to be as spry and charming at 73 as he was at half that age.This time out these elders are set in orbit around a new generational quartet Rey (Daisy Ridley) a scrappy scavenger on the arid planet Jakku; Finn (John Boyega) a sensitive turncoat stormtrooper; Poe Dameron (the sadly underutilized Oscar Isaac) a hotshot rebel pilot; and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a masked acolyte of the Dark Side. The newcomers all offer strong performances--in particular Ridley and Driver--and one of Abramss more cunning flourishes is to set up their characters as interlocutors for a younger cohort of fans or proto-fans They too have heard of the Force and Luke Skywalker and Han Solo; and like some portion of the millions who will make their way to the multiplex this weekend they too are wondering what all the fuss is about.The characters pinball off one another in one familiar-yet-satisfying sequence after another a dogfight between the Millennium Falcon and pursuing Tie Fighters; an encounter with a wise and bearded mystic (Max von Sydow); a motley cantina; an X-Wing assault on yet another asteroidal super-weapon. The narrative revelations meanwhile unspool quickly enough that any further description of the plot would likely describe too much. This is very much a movie best experienced with a minimum of foreknowledge.Abrams has begun one of the most important reclamation projects of our time the complete erasure from cultural memory of The Phantom Menace and its sequels.Careful readers may by now have noticed the absence of any references to Lucass second prequel trilogy--no Anakin (at least not by that name) no Amidala no Darth Sidious and (thank god) no Jar Jar. This too is entirely deliberate. From the earliest stages of Abramss production it was clear that he was well aware of the deficiencies of those latter films the orgiastic overuse of CGI the window-mannequin performances the fourth-rate dialogue. And so with The Force Awakens Abrams has begun one of the most important reclamation projects of our time the complete erasure from cultural memory of The Phantom Menace and its sequels.This is Abramss second relaunch of a beloved celestio-cinematic property following his Star Trek movies and it leaves no doubt whatsoever where his heart lies. His impatience with the talky moral theorizing of the Trekverse was evident in almost every frame of his Federation forays. With The Force Awakens by contrast he is directing for fans and as a fan. Its borderline miraculous how well he captures the mood and rhythms of the first Star Wars trilogy its pace and wit its balance between earnestness and irony the joy it took in set design and creature-building. The Force Awakens may have cost 200 million to produce but what one sees onscreen is not the money but the love.There are plenty of complaints one might make of the movie if one were in the mood to make them. Almost no effort at all is made to establish its political context in relation to the previous films The nefarious ""First Order"" slots in seamlessly for the Empire (they havent even bothered changing the uniforms) and the Rebels have become the ""Resistance"" despite their alliance with an indifferently sketched ""Republic."" The movies structure too is more than a bit flimsy from the accidental acquisition of the Millennium Falcon to an unnecessary encounter with some notably Abramsesque tooth-and-tentacle monsters.But perhaps the strongest critique one could make of The Force Awakens--in the sense that it is completely accurate--is that its ensnared in its own nostalgia. The original Star Wars was in almost every way an original a movie that forever changed filmmaking for both good and ill. And while The Force Awakens is giddy and good-natured enough to provide fun for fans and non-fans alike much of the enjoyment it provides is by design derivative a refraction of past pleasures. For some that may not be enough. But for my part I was delighted to be once again transported to a long time ago in a galaxy far far away--specifically to May 25 1977 when my 10-year-old self saw Star Wars on opening day and had my mind forever blown.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

But itas the fun of seeing something fairly successfully redone with the promise of more of the same to come. 1.3k Shares Share 1.1k Tweet 149 Share 8 Share Email Print Share Photo Lucasfilm Director J.J. Abrams is so intuitively unoriginal that hes almost mystical He seems to be using the Force to get on the wavelength of other filmmakers. He aped Steven Spielbergs signature moves in the sci-fi adventure Super 8. He rekindled Star Trek onscreen delighting many fans -- even if they couldnt point to a single performance or scene that surpassed the old films or shows. Now with Star Wars The Force Awakens he does a good imitation of George Lucas circa 1977. He and co-writers Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan (who co-wrote by far the best of the series The Empire Strikes Back) merge old and new streams mixing Han Solo Princess Leia Luke Skywalker Chewbacca and others into a newish plot centering on young uns Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). The movie has already blown away advance-sale records and when you go (which of course you will) I bet youll have fun -- I did mostly. But its the fun of seeing something fairly successfully redone with the promise of more of the same to come. Its a fans wet dream and a modern studios too. It says where money is concerned the galaxys the limit. Related Stories The Force Awakens Is About to Make an Ungodly Sum of Money. What Does That Say About the Movie? Force Awakens Star Daisy Ridley Evaluates 8 of Her Star Wars Toys See Every Line Spoken by a Woman Not Named Leia in the Original Star Wars Trilogy The movie opens with John Williamss triumphal orchestra blast and the titles that make us salivate on cue followed by a backward exposition crawl announcing that Luke Skywalker has vanished and ... a bunch of other stuff. I honestly couldnt follow it all but the takeaway is that the Dark Side is now embodied by the First Order (rather than the Empire) which borrows its rhetoric and architecture from the Third Reich and that the Resistance led by General (not Princess) Leia has sent her best pilot Poe Dameron (a funny mouthy Oscar Isaac) to obtain a map to Lukes location. Dont ask why -- I couldnt tell you. Its a McGuffin. Hey Max von Sydow has that map Hi Max Bye Max The First Order massacres a bunch of people (and other life forms) and captures Poe who has already hidden the map inside his droid BB-8 a rolling ball topped with half of another ball with the manner of a yelping puppy. Frankly I found him/it borderline intolerable but the simple design is ingenious and how wonderful that he/it is not computer-generated but of our world. And thereas evidently no human inside him. Heas a real robot In any case BB-8 takes off the way R2-D2 and C-3PO did 38 years ago bound for the next Luke Skywalker. Is it Rey? Shes a scavenger on a desert planet (not unlike the young Luke) and also has a backstory that will be revealed in subsequent chapters. All we know right now is that shes maybe possibly got Luke-ish abilities and that the charming Ridley bears such an obvious resemblance to Keira Knightley (down to her fanged grin) that she might be a clone. The main thing is that she marks the movies biggest departure from Lucass worldview. Many critics over the years have complained that Lucass is a boys universe but nowadays princesses fight their own battles -- with lightsabers. She and Finn -- the core of Star Wars The Next Generation -- have been expertly contrived to appeal to millions. I dont think its an accident that Finn is black and that he begins the film as a Stormtrooper having been kidnapped from his home world and enslaved by the First Order. An attack of conscience makes him throw off his white armor at which point Abrams cuts to a close-up of him over-emoting. But Boyega has a powerful presence -- he made a startling film debut as a hood in the urban sci-fi thriller Attack the Block (2011) -- and it will be fun to watch his character become less moist. Hes so expressive he wears his heart not just on his sleeve but on his trembling lightsaber. The gimmick is that Finn keeps trying to rescue his damsel in distress but ends up far more distressed than she does. The third wheel of the film is Kylo Ren the junior Darth Vader of the First Order played by Adam Driver -- who overcomes the giggles from Girls fans (there is a fan overlap oddly enough) that greet his first appearance to embody an Oedipal nightmare. He stops the show with the first lightsaber temper tantrum which sends minions and Stormtroopers scurrying. I wont spoil the twist that comes early and you probably already know that throws us back into the world of fathers and sons and the Dark Side of the Force. But the best things are the old things familiar camera setups scene-change wipes costumes John Williamss music (theres even a melancholy reprise of that superb Darth Vader theme) enemy fighter ships that emit plangent groans the Millennium Falcon and of course the human stars. Though his voice is now a croak Harrison Ford slips into the swashbuckling Han Solo role with youthful vigor his timing as crisp as ever and Carrie Fishers cracked deepened post-rehab voice gives Leia new depth. Peter Mayhews Chewbacca gets lots of laugh lines -- or yowls. The one-liners are largely second-rate but The Force Awakens gives you the joy of reunions and the tragedy of loss. It must be bittersweet for George Lucas however much money Disney paid him to surrender creative control. I often think back to 2003 when the New York Times sent me to write about a Lord of the Rings movie marathon ending with the premiere of the final film The Return of the King. A young woman I interviewed actually teared up explaining that Rings director Peter Jackson did a great job because he was a fan of Tolkiens books and understood what they meant to other fans. Against this she cited Lucass Star Wars prequels which made billions but left most people cold (except for Jar Jar who left them livid). Lucas created Star Wars she said but because he wasnt a fan he forgot why people responded to the first film. That a sequel made by a fan would be better than one by a creator seemed counterintuitive 12 years ago but as fan culture has become more dominant (and lucrative) the idea now seems prescient. Its the subtext of Lucass words at a recent Kennedy Center event where he said -- with a touch of sadness -- that The Force Awakens was the Star Wars movie the fans have been looking for and that (by implication) he didnt give them. I find myself of two minds about this. Apart from the suspenseful last half-hour of The Revenge of the Sith the Star Wars prequels were truly terrible marked by lifeless pageantry tectonic-plate pacing Jar Jar effects-cluttered frames and Medusa dialogue (i.e. it turned actors to stone). But Lucas was attempting something that would surpass Lawrence of Arabia. He wanted to tell the story of the fall of a democratic republic beginning with the sabotage of trade routes lingering on debates (and betrayals) in a government assembly and ending with the corruption of an idealistic young man who would go on to become one of the most iconic villains in pop culture. He wanted to explore the peril of having too much passion which could be exploited by a knowing demagogue so that the story of Darth Vader became The Last Temptation of Anakin Skywalker. He wanted to do all this with lightsaber battles and awesome sci-fi spectacle. Yes he forgot how to tell a story. Yes he forgot (or ignored) what the fans wanted. But in his clumsy way he was going for what had never been done instead of redoing something that had. Its too bad it has to be one way or the other. Can someone -- as theyd say in Ghostbusters -- merge the streams?

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 16 2015 Save for later Saved Star Wars The Force Awakens stars John Boyega. Disney LucasFilm/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of So its finally here as if you didnt know. The good news is that ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" is easily the best movie in the franchise since ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Unlike the dismal prequel trilogy that preceded it or the too-slick ""Return of the Jedi"" ""The Force Awakens"" has much of the spirit and inventiveness of the original two installments ""A New Hope"" and ""Empire"" its sequel.Ironically George Lucas was not creatively involved in the new film which was directed by J.J.Abrams and co-scripted by ""Star Wars"" veteran Lawrence Kasdan and is being distributed by Disney to whom Lucas sold the franchise in 2012 for billions. With sequels and spinoffs stretching ahead as far as the eye can see Disney will undoubtedly make it all back many times over.Reviewing this movie entails such a potential minefield of spoiler alerts that for self-preservation I think I will dispense here with most of the niceties of plot description. But let it be said that the action occurs 30 years after the end of ""Return of the Jedi."" Theres a young woman Rey (Daisy Ridley) who scavenges on a desert planet and is as feisty and formidable as a cross between Annie Oakley and Lara Croft. Recommended Could you survive the Star Wars universe? Take our quiz Theres also Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) a captured rebel pilot who is being tortured aboard a Star Destroyer by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a Darth Vader-ish bad guy. Finn (John Boyega) a renegade stormtrooper of the nefarious First Order (a military wing inspired by the Empire) teams up with Poe and crash-lands on Reys planet. BB-8 a marvelous droid made up of revolving spheres and half-spheres who is carrying information vital to the resistance is a welcome addition to the Star Wars toy store. Many of the old toys show up as well and its like a reunion of old friends including Chewbacca R2-D2 and C-3PO. Test your knowledge Could you survive the Star Wars universe? Take our quiz Monitor Movie Guide Theres also Harrison Ford as Han Solo manfully holding down his role after all these years and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia (except now shes a general). Ill leave it up to you to wonder if Mark Hamills Luke Skywalker is in the mix.Abrams understands that ""The Force Awakens"" had to be both a tribute to the original films and a reboot. One of the many problems with the prequels was their obsessive overreliance on CGI effects. There is of course CGI in ""The Force Awakens"" but its comparatively minimal. The film looks handmade and this allows for a greater range of human emotion too. When tragedy strikes you feel it.I am not one of those who subscribes to the mythology of the ""Star Wars"" saga. I have always regarded the Joseph Campbell-inspired hoo-ha as so much deep-dish blathering. When I wrote about ""Return of the Jedi"" a while back in my book ""Rainer on Film"" I described it as ""a myth without a vision"" and to some extent that remains true even of ""The Force Awakens.""But Abrams isnt really attempting to mythologize the saga here. His focus is on staging a whiz-bang show and the new additions especially the charismatic Rey with her endless derring-do and the plucky Finn are especially welcome. (The fact that a young woman and a young black man are at the films forefront is also welcome.) Follow the Monitor on Pinterest I only regret that Lupita Nyongo is playing Maz Kanata a 1000-year-old space pirate in CGI disguise. Shes unrecognizable which is not the sort of thing you should be saying about one of the more stunning women in movies.If the sequels to ""The Force Awakens"" are as good as this film that will probably be because they follow the same formula heavy on the human side more comedy less CGI more fresh faces and more delightful droids. And yes one must pay homage to the Force. Grade A- (Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence.)

Comments (96) click to enlarge Star Wars The Force Awakens -- An IMAX 3D Experience Rated PG-13  136 minutes  2015 The franchise that wrecked American cinema is back with fanboy auteur J.J. Abrams (Star Trek Mission Impossible III) taking the reins from series creator George Lucas. Ill spare you the scrolling yellow text but suffice it to say that this brings back the coed trio of the original trilogy 30 years after their previous exploits (Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher Mark Hamill) while prepping a new trio of young bucks to replicate the seniors chemistry (Oscar Isaac Daisy Ridley John Boyega). As with other installments this is less a movie than an exercise in massaging a juvenile-minded audience that wants the experience to be new and familiar at the same time.

Abrams restores balance to the Force. By Dana Stevens Rey (Daisy Ridley) and BB-8 in a scene from The Force Awakens. Courtesy of Lucasfilm The summer the original Star Wars came out--the chapter that George Lucas later rechristened Episode IV A New Hope--I was 11 years old ostensibly part of the movies ideal target demographic. I still remember some images with the whoa-thats-cool awe they inspired at the time the oblique angle of the words as they disappeared into space in that opening crawl. The twin suns setting over the horizon of Luke Skywalkers desolate home planet Tatooine. But even as a middle-schooler I never quite warmed to the Star Wars mythos which seemed too schematic and fairy-tale-like with its white-clad princess and black-garbed mouth-breathing bad guy. I preferred the cerebral sci-fi riddles and intergalactic do-gooder diplomacy of the Star Trek universe (and if were being honest Treks Kirk and Spock did more for my incipient libido than either Luke or Han Solo). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. My own preteen predilections aside it soon became clear that the country at that moment was hungry for something exactly like Star Wars. With astonishing speed we incorporated its codes and catchphrases--may the Force be with you Dont go over to the Dark Side--into everyday language. Over the next few years as the sequels (the early real ones) rolled out we collected action figures; spun out complementary narratives in novelizations fan fiction animated series and video games; and generally wove the legend of the repressive Empire and the ragtag Resistance into our collective self-image both as political beings and as consumers of ever more sophisticated entertainment products. What else is the famous ""1984"" Apple commercial--released the year after we said goodbye to Han Luke and Leia at the triumphant Ewok hoedown that ends The Return of the Jedi--but a symbolic re-enactment of the victory of the brave scrappy individualists against the faceless horde of Stormtroopers? Advertisement Passing over Lucas three early 2000s prequels in tactful silence (as befits the treatment of the vanity projects of a revered but dotty old uncle) we find ourselves 38 years after that first blockbuster summer still living in the pop-cultural world Star Wars built. So director and co-writer J.J. Abrams--having proven his skill at re-energizing franchises with two lively if uninspired installments of the Star Trek series--both has his work cut out for him and doesnt. Honestly the man could make a hopeless hash of a movie and still break world box-office records as long as there were lightsaber battles and adorable beeping robots and exploding space stations and plenty of verbal and visual callbacks to the series most famous moments. But to find a fresh reason for Star Wars to exist in 2015--that truly would mark Abrams as the new hope. And with Star Wars The Force Awakens Ill be damned if Abrams hasnt gone and done it--not reinvented the wheel perhaps (though in the adorable-beeping-android character BB-8 he has at least found some creative new uses for the rolling sphere) but reinvigorated the venerable franchise for the 21st century starting with a winning pair of heroes that the occasionally sexist and racist Star Wars universe has been in need of for a long time a black man--and not in a helpmate role like Billy Dee Williams Lando Calrissian but playing one of the films leads--and a young woman whos distinctly not in need of even a smidgen of saving. Abrams hasnt reinvented the wheel (though in BB-8 he has found some creative new uses for the rolling sphere). Sharing a screen with Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill--all of whom come back to reprise their original roles--would be a tall task for any young relatively unknown actor. And fledgling thespians cutting their teeth on Star Wars dialogue have not historically made for a very pretty sight as those of us who survived Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portmans leaden courtship scenes can attest. But John Boyega as a Stormtrooper who deserts his post after a moral crisis and Daisy Ridley as a lone-wolf dissident who mistakes him for a Resistance fighter create mythical personas of their own that are strong enough to stand up alongside the archetypes of Han Luke and Leia. (Boyega and Ridley both English actors are better known for their work on television than in film though Boyega made a striking debut in the 2011 sci-fi comedy Attack the Block.) Like their Star Wars forebears Boyegas Finn and Ridleys Rey are brave funny and admirable but also imperfect uncertain and sometimes afraid. That is to say theyre genuine multisided characters with believable motivations--no small victory in a movie designed with the express purpose of breaking world box-office records. In fact the dialogue and acting in this cast-of-thousands saga are pretty stellar across the board not a sentence I ever thought I would type in a review of a Star Wars movie where unforgettable performances tend to exist side-by-side with mediocre ones. Abrams smartest coup (in a script he co-wrote with Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan) was to upend our understanding of the Star Wars moral universe by unmasking a Stormtrooper early and revealing not a soulless killing machine but a conflicted guilty man underneath. (Only the mildest of spoilers follow--not much more than what you could infer from the many trailers.) Its FN-2187 (Boyega) who bears only a number instead of a name because he was torn from his parents as a small child and raised in a hypermilitarized training camp. (Not to push this films thematic ambition past where it means to go but the parallels with slavery are hard to miss.) Advertisement The Empire has now been reborn as the First Order a Third Reich-style fascist state with some seriously stylized public rallies. FN-2187 traumatized by his first experience in battle escapes the First Order in a stolen craft piloted by escaped prisoner Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) who immediately rechristens the young man ""Finn"" and entrusts him--lack of experience be damned--with the co-pilot seat. Together the two must reach our old heroes to deliver the movies intergalactic MacGuffin (I wont spoil what it is) before they can be intercepted by Darth Vader revivalist Kylo Ren (black cape and helmet filtered breathy growl) played by Adam Driver. Ren in turn must answer to Supreme Leader Snoke about whom I will only say that a) he is magnificently voiced by Andy Serkis and b) he looks like hed be more comfortable in a jar of formaldehyde than on the throne where he sits. Seeing how the new generation of adventurers hook up with the old guard and what surprising alliances they form along the way makes for the whole pleasure of this solid satisfying entry to the Star Wars canon. So Ill say nothing more of the light-speed plot--there are moments of real emotion and wrenching loss as well as some genuinely thrilling adventure sequences and well-earned laughs. (Kasdan also co-wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark and sometimes The Force Awakens wiseacre one-liners feel more evocative of Indiana Jones than any galaxy far far away.) Top Comment Maybe Rian Johnson can do for Star Wars what Alfonso Cuaron did for Harry Potter before it got plodding and pedestrian again.  More... Join In The very last shot of The Force Awakens teases the sequel with a tad more brazenness than one might like but its hard to walk out denying your appetite is whetted. The next time around director Rian Johnson (Brick Looper) is getting a crack at Star Wars and--though its doubtful how much freedom this big-bucks operation can allow for individual auteurship--maybe he will take the story and characters down a different more experimental road. But its to Abrams credit that he wasnt satisfied to churn out a glossy appealing product that would rake in a billion dollars at the box office as The Force Awakens is predicted to do regardless of its quality. Abrams got in there and crafted a good movie (that is also a glossy appealing expertly packaged and promoted product). May the Force be with him.

Lucasfilm hide caption toggle caption Lucasfilm Both Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) return in Star Wars The Force Awakens. Lucasfilm With bigger advance sales than any movie in history Star Wars The Force Awakens needs reviews like a Death Star needs a decorative fountain. But all you really want to know is whether its good right? Well in fact it is better than it had to be. The fanfare starts and were all kids again anyway. Thirty-eight years and sticking it out through three lackluster prequels hasnt dimmed the force of memory. I still believed -- Im guessing we all believed -- that the magic could come back and now director J.J. Abrams has proved it. He not only got the old gang back together -- Han (Harrison Ford) Leia (Carrie Fisher) Luke (Mark Hamill) -- but starting with an opening battle on a desert planet he introduces a brace of new young and (happily) diverse characters resistance pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac) and his spherical droid BB-8 (sort of R2-D2 mated with a volleyball); new villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who looks and sounds a lot like an old villain; scrappy female scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) whos also a pilot; and Finn (John Boyega) a Stormtrooper gone AWOL who decides Rey needs protecting whether she wants it or not. i Daisy Ridley plays the scrappy scavenger Rey. David James/Lucasfilm hide caption toggle caption David James/Lucasfilm Daisy Ridley plays the scrappy scavenger Rey. David James/Lucasfilm I shouldnt -- and wont -- talk about what any of them do for the films 135 minutes. Let me just say that they do it really well Rey is feisty enough to banish thoughts of Katniss Everdeen from the most devoted Hunger Games enthusiast; Finn is the sort of impetuous can-do hero who will inspire a whole new generation of Star Warriors; and when the old warriors arrive on the scene well just try not to tear up. It is possible to have questions (Why does Adam Drivers villain wear a mask and cloak? A goth thing left over from intergalactic high school maybe?) and the nostalgia gets thick enough that the film turns into an echo chamber at times with family themes reverberating from that original trilogy. So its a good thing that the script by Lawrence Kasdan (who wrote much of the original trilogy) is so light on its feet and funny. Harrison Ford can still land a punchline and a punch in battles that Abrams keeps as rip-roaring as you were hoping. As for themes? Well family and friendship and resisting authoritarianism I guess. I was seeing red-state-blue-state resonance in the colors of the lightsabers for a second then realized that was just because someone had sent me a ""Trump Vader"" video last week. Monkey See The Best-Case Scenario Star Wars The Force Awakens Whats most fun about what Abrams does here isnt the big stuff though thats pretty glorious. Amid all the grandeur -- the crashed spaceships and looming Death Stars -- Abrams lives for the intimate details that make this story feel so real and relatable. Like letting you see how a spherical droid would descend a staircase -- just like a little kid would as it happens. And watching it I felt like a little kid again Force awakened.

Entertainment ""The Force Awakens"" Will Make You Fall In Love With ""Star Wars"" All Over Again Not too shabby J. J. Abrams. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > John Boyega and Daisy Ridley in Star Wars The Force Awakens. Lucasfilm / Disney ID 7598896 Like the future the new Star Wars movie belongs to the young.With all love for Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill who each got their own warm round of applause when first appearing onscreen during Tuesday nights New York press screening of The Force Awakens its the new characters -- especially Rey (Daisy Ridley) Finn (John Boyega) Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and BB-8 -- who steal the show. A lot of J. J. Abrams satisfying gratifyingly fun film is familiar by design paying homage to the past and to the legacy of the most famous sci-fi franchise of all time. So its not just a comment on Disneys inescapable marketing barrage but a sincerely intended compliment that the fresh-faced heroes and antiheroes The Force Awakens introduces feel like future friends youve heard a lot about but are only just meeting.And in a clever touch these characters are like the rest of us fans. Rey whos been eking out a living as a scavenger on the planet of Jakku while waiting for her familys return gasps in delight when she learns shes in the company of Han Solo (Ford) and that the ship she helped abscond with is the Millennium Falcon. Finn a Stormtrooper who develops a conscience and goes AWOL wonders aloud about Hans war hero past. (Chewbacca whos been along for the whole ride just shrugs.) View this image > Oscar Isaac in Star Wars The Force Awakens. Lucasfilm / Disney ID 7599022 On the darker side Kylo Rens (Adam Driver) desire to follow in the footsteps of Darth Vader include ownership of Vaders iconic and apparently highly collectible mask. ""Its true. All of it -- the dark side the Jedi. Theyre real"" Han informs Rey. These characters arent just inheritors of a legacy theyre aspirants to it characters who are aware of the events of the first trilogy as history merged with the stuff of legend. Theyre proof that anyone born in the age of Star Wars ends up being at least a little conversant in its mythology even if theyre actual characters in the series.If Rey were just a bit more fluent in her fandom she might realize that she doesnt just get swept up in a mission to find Luke Skywalker (Hamill) but that shes following in his footsteps. Like Luke she starts off as a desert planet rube whose life is changed when she encounters a droid BB-8 whos carrying some essential intel. Instead of the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire being at war its now the Republic-supported Resistance and the First Order but theyre essentially the same things down to their choice of starfighters and to the First Orders Starkiller Base a next-gen Death Star that you can bet looms large in the movies final act. One of The Force Awakens great and sometimes irksome ironies is that for all the secrecy thats surrounded it in its long ramp-up the broad strokes plot is mostly lifted from A New Hope. View this image > Adam Driver in Star Wars The Force Awakens. Lucasfilm / Disney ID 7598992 And The Force Awakens sometimes feels as much like a remake of A New Hope as it does a continuation. But if they hew a little too close to the 1977 film Abrams and his co-writers Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt understand that what audiences want from this age of sequels and reboots and remakes is the cozy feeling that comes from the known combining with the new. The Force Awakens doesnt strike that balance as ingeniously as Creed its spiritual sibling in cinematic baton-passing but its obligatory fan service gestures are completed without too much winking See Han noting to Leia ""Youve changed your hair"" C-3PO leaning into the frame during an emotional moment and the swashbuckling pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) leading an X-wing squad on a recognizable bombing run.The older characters maybe arent served as well as they could be though Ford is so much better and more engaged than hes been in years in his reprised role as Han; grayer and more weathered but still infamous back to his old tricks. Its Han who gets the most screen time of the old guard Han and Chewie and their fond grumbly rapport is as good as the gruff but affectionate exchanges he has with Rey and Finn these young kids who have no idea what theyre getting into. He seems as won over as the audience is by their newness by the way that Finn is so clearly bowled over by Rey and so out of his depth by Reys scrappy competence with his ship and her awe at seeing a green planet for the first time. View this image > Peter Mayhew and Harrison Ford in Star Wars The Force Awakens. Lucasfilm / Disney ID 7598925 Theyre earnest and irresistibly sweet and Boyega and Ridley the least established actors in the cast prove themselves more than capable of being the franchises new leads. Their characters forge an unforced connection coming to each others aid equally though Rey shows herself to be the more formidable of the two. If The Force Awakens thankfully tosses the ponderous mysticism of the prequels aside to take on things like fandom instead it also finds a way to be about the pleasure of watching a new generation of people share in the things you loved. The wistfulness that Han (and to a lesser extent Lupita Nyongos motion-captured wisdom dispenser Maz Kanata) displays when watching Rey and Finn sometimes feels akin to that of a parent watching his child head off to the prom and knowing no lectures are needed about proper behavior because these kids are fundamentally solid.Compared to them Kylo Ren would be the lanky angry-depressive goth kid smoking in the parking lot foregoing the black trench coat in favor of hooded robes and a mask. Ren serves the First Order under the command and tutelage of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and is a powerful but conflicted antagonist with his temper his crossguard lightsaber and his dark past. Ren is a torturer and a killer but hes also complicated and torn up inside and Girls Driver fits unexpectedly well into the Star Wars universe as an antihero with his long face and mane of dark hair. If this franchise has always been one about the battle between good and evil Ren introduces some emotional complexity to a major scene retaining audience empathy while proving himself capable of terrible things. View this image > Ridley and BB-8 in Star Wars The Force Awakens. Lucasfilm / Disney ID 7599076 The Force Awakens really sings when its focus is on Finn Rey Ren and the delightfully expressive BB-8 (Poe heartbreaker that he is doesnt get explored in depth in this first installment). And thats the finest testament to its quality -- that it leaves you wanting more from these new characters not feeling like theyre in the way of the classic creations everyone came to see onscreen once more. The Force Awakens doesnt pass the torch so much as it uses the Force to call it from across the room and in doing so provides a reminder that the thing that made the Star Wars movies beloved in the first place was their joyous sense of adventure.

Abrams just wants to give the joy of childhood back to a generation that fell in love with Star Wars back in 1977. (Plus maybe win a new generation over to that storys mythological power.) Because what hes done is to remake Star Wars A New Hope; tweaking it for the passage of time; improving on the acting the effects and the dialogue; and tossing in some bits from its sequels (a lightsaber in the snow father-son conflicts above the void a journey to find a Jedi master a strike team sent to take out a shield generator etc.). Some things are the same with different names the Empire and the Rebellion are now The First Order and the Resistance. Some things are the same with different people the Emperor and Darth Vader are now the Supreme Leader and Kylo Ren. Some things are the same with different sizes - New Hope had a weapon that could destroy a planet; Force Awakens has a weapon that can destroy multiple planets. (Both have a weak spot.) Some things are the same but updated an orphan in the desert with a mysterious heritage a swashbuckling pilot a plucky droid. And some things are simply the same C-3PO and R2-D2 the Millennium Falcon and oh yes the Force. The unkind view -- the cynical view the greedminded view -- is that there is no need for new ideas when people will line up to pay for old ones. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

In other words co-producer co-writer and director J.J. Abrams has done exactly what every diehard sabre-obsessed Force-loving Jedi-admiring Darth Vader-fearing fan has been dreaming about since Episode VI Return of the Jedi 32 years ago. He has made a real Star Wars movie that fans can truly embrace that honours the legacy of George Lucas and that is better in its storytelling than anything Lucas himself did with his unfortunate prequel trilogy. The supremely confident execution of this new movie -- which is officially Episode VII -- earns Abrams and his team a perfect five-star rating. The nearly universal lack of originality in it -- because this epic opus for all its dazzle and humour and action and even daring is a recurring echo of everything you have already seen in the previous six Star Wars episodes -- knocks it down to a four-star rating. But the introduction of thrilling new characters provides the perfect complement to the return of trusted old friends. So we can assign the middle ground of magnificent a four-and-a-half star rating. The newbies include the scavenger-turned-heroine Rey (played by the inspirational Daisy Ridley) the Stormtrooper-turned-hero Finn (an energetic and engaging John Boyega) the Dark Sider uber-villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver conveys his characters internal struggle) and the fun new droid BB-8 (a natural attraction for kids). In addition there is Poe Dameron (Oscar Issac) a resistance pilot who akin to a new Luke Skywalker alien pirate Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyongo in an intriguing motion capture performance) Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis in another mo-cap triumph) and various baddies of the First Order the successor to The Empire. Among them is General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) commander of the Starkiller Base that dwarfs Vaders old haunts. The roster of oldies-but-goodies is comprised of Han Solo (a still-feisty Harrison Ford) Princess and now General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher with a new and more demure hairdo and attitude) Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew is still charismatic as the Wookiee) C-3PO (Anthony Daniels whom everyone loves in this role) and both of R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and Admiral Ackbar (Timothy Rose) in cameos. The Force Awakens is a direct sequel to Return of the Jedi with those 30-plus years having lapsed without much difference in the way the universe operates. The Third Reich-like First Order continues The Empires fascist ways; the Resistance is still fighting oppression; and outposts such as Jakku where the femme role model Rey has been living alone since she was abandoned at the age of five are desolate places where humans and other creatures live hardscrabble existences (although the vistas photographed in Abu Dhabi are beautiful). As must be apparent by now I am refusing to tell much about the story that Abrams created for The Force Awakens with one of Lucas collaborators on the original trilogy filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan. They built their scenario on the bones of what screenwriter Michael Arndt had done for Episode VII before Abrams took the project over at the request of Walt Disney Studios. Lucas also served early on as a consultant but there is little evidence that he contributed much to the specifics of The Force Awakens even though his DNA is all over the finished film. Telling too much or even anything other than the basic opening premise that Rey Finn and BB-8 are on the run to evade First Order Stormtroopers would lead to stunning spoilers. My suggestion is to avoid finding out about many plot points from any source because this will ruin your enjoyment of the movie. And yet there is that familiarity throughout with Abrams team touching on the same beats and scenarios (from a cantina scene to the aerial combat sequences) the same John Williams music score and the same blend of comedy and pathos and action. Plus familiar themes rumble underneath the story including questions of family fatherhood and loyalty. At the same time we get to spend a lot of fun and/or dramatic time with Fords Solo while Ridleys Rey and Boyegas Finn give us a pair of dynamic new heroes to follow in future Star Wars Episodes.

John Boyega in Star Wars The Force Awakens. While there are elements that feel special and fresh mostly The Force Awakens strives to please instead of surprise. When youve been charged with reviving one of the most obsessively beloved franchises in modern movies is it better to defy expectations or to meet them? With Star Wars The Force Awakens J.J. Abrams splits the difference and the movie suffers--in the end its perfectly adequate hitting every beat. But why settle for adequacy? For the first 40 minutes or so The Force Awakens feels like something special and fresh For one thing Abrams and his team of designers and technicians introduce a new star a droid named BB-8. A roly-poly cueball with a surprisingly expressive half-dome for a head--and a vocabulary of squeaks and squiggles that are more eloquent than mere words--BB-8 is both modernist and old-fashioned at once a marvelous creation that could have sprung from the imagination of Jules Verne. And Abrams introduces a note of glorious melancholy in the character of Rey (newcomer Daisy Ridley charismatic in a no-nonsense way) a teenage scavenger marooned on a sandy planet longing to find her way back to the family from whom shes been separated. Reys loneliness and her self-sufficiency are intertwined. Early in the movie when she befriends BB-8 (another orphan of sorts) its a meeting of kindred spirits. At that point Abrams makes us believe anything could happen--its the best kind of movie feeling. But somewhere along the way Abrams begins delivering everything we expect as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didnt know we wanted. Hes taken care to do certain things right The plot is relatively unencumbered by complicated mythology. Anyone coming to the Star Wars universe cold will be able to follow the story--the script was written by Abrams Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt (based on characters created by George Lucas) and theyre more interested in clarity than exclusivity. The story takes place 30 years after Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The fascist First Order has risen from the remains of the old Empire. Darth Vader disciple Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is one of the chief baddies answering to Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) a giant scary noseless dude who sits placidly in an oversized chair like a dark-lord version of the Lincoln Monument. The First Order hopes to destroy...everything. Luckily the Resistance is ready to fight back Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is now a general; her brother Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the last Jedi and a key player in the struggle has gone missing and shes desperate to find him. The new characters folded into the mix include Finn (John Boyega) a renegade Stormtrooper who becomes an accidental hero and stalwart Resistance fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). But the wry grizzled soul of the movie is Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who returns with his furry sidekick Chewbacca. Chewbacca hasnt aged a bit; Han on the other hand looks like hes been round the galaxy a few hundred times but damned if he doesnt wear it well. For a while watching The Force Awakens its enjoyable enough to sink into the films relatively low-tech production design. Everything looks a little dusty and dirty including BB-8 whose white-and-orange chassis is so smudged you could almost write ""wash me"" on its surface with your finger--its a marvelous touch. And the reappearance of Han Solos freighter ship the Millennium Falcon is majestic to behold It has the look of a classic automobile thats fallen on hard times slightly rusty and with a fender or a piece of chrome missing here or there but somehow keeping all its dignity intact. Abrams also introduces a delightful minor character wise old barkeep Maz Kanata (voiced by Lupita Nyongo)--shes a CGI creation who looks like the love child of E.T. and Lena Horne. And yet The Force Awakens adds up to something less than the sum of its parts. The early scenes have a relaxed assured pace. But as the story moves forward Abrams becomes more mired in the task of keeping the plot mechanics in gear. Theres the expected climactic battle between X-wing starfighters and TIE fighters which is mildly exciting and nothing more--the fact that its punctuated with dumb dialogue like ""General Their shields are down"" ""Prepare to fire"" and even the classic ""It would take a miracle to save us now"" surely doesnt help. And the movies big twist clearly intended to be a moment of Shakespearean grandeur is handled clumsily Instead of allowing a significant figure to have his grand moment Abrams cuts to other characters expressing shock and dismay as if he didnt trust the audience to know what to feel. The Force Awakens is hardly a failure. It has its share of charm like the moment when Han and Leia reconnect after years of separation--theyre the classic lovers who cant stand to be in each others presence for more than five minutes but who miss each other quietly and desperately year in year out. As Kylo Ren Driver kitted out in an all-black man-gown and a helmet whose elongated nose echoes the shape of his real schnozz beneath is surprisingly menacing. In one of the movies finest moments Ren--unmasked and intense--engages Rey in a major stare-down an unholy duel between the light side of the Force and the dark. The sexual energy between them is strange and unsettling like a theremin sonata only they can hear. But mostly The Force Awakens strives to please instead of surprise. Abrams wants us to walk away happy. He just doesnt give us much to take home. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Slideshow The Force awakens a new ""Star Wars"" generation Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Star Wars The Force Awakens >> Thats the evil Supreme Leader of the First Order talking in Star Wars The Force Awakens sensing that yes something is astir in the cosmos. Indeed 10 years after the final installment of George Lucas not-exactly-stellar Star Wars prequel trilogy reboot king J.J. Abrams has jump-started the mythic franchise. Months and months of micromanaged Disney Studio hype behind us (well almost) its time for some strap-yourself-in hyperdrive. Yes that old jalopy the Millennium Falcon flies again. Set a few decades after the Ewok rumbles of 1983s Return of the Jedi (the final installment in the original Star Wars trilogy) The Force Awakens is half reboot half remake and all fun. The Rebel Alliance is now the Resistance; the Galactic Empire the First Order. But the opening expository crawl still runs off into the infinite darkness followed by the ominous thrum of a giant spaceship as it flies across - and eclipses - a planet. That planet is Jakku a desert orb where a young woman named Rey (Daisy Ridley) gets by selling scrap metal and where she will soon partner with a young storm-trooper-gone-AWOL by the name of Finn (John Boyega). Poe (Oscar Isaac) who we are told is ""the best pilot in the Resistance"" teaches Finn to fly. Hes a quick study. On the Dark Side Isaacs Ex Machina co-star Domhnall Gleeson is a young First Order general answering to Ren a Vaderlike nemesis whose youthfulness is revealed when he takes off that Darth mask in the third act. (No spoilers here) Like Creed that rousing and excellent Rocky hand-off The Force Awakens assembles a new generation of stars to take over the operation. But the old-timers are happy to be on hand to help with the transition. Harrison Ford weathered worn and less jaunty of gait nonetheless proves a welcome presence as Han Solo supplying wisecracks and seat-of-the-pants mentorship for the new recruits. (As seen in the trailer - by hundreds of millions of fans - he confirms that ""the Force the Jedi - its all true."") Carrie Fisher returns as Leia no longer a bun-haired princess but a battle-weary general a leader of the Resistance. Even Peter Mayhew the actor beneath all that Wookieeshag carpeting is back as Chewbacca Hans copilot and Kashyyykian-speaking best bud. Lovable droids R2-D2 and C-3PO make their appearance too though the former doesnt really light up (literally) until The Force Awakens new droid BB-8 rolls into view. Abrams and his team (co-writers Lawrence Kasdan the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi scribe for institutional memory and Michael Arndt for not-sure-what) invoke the original canon with reverence - and with the certainty that first-generation Star Wars geeks will eat it up. Every morsel. Hence a bar full of intergalactic lowlifes not unlike the old Mos Eisley Cantina - this one operated by a wizened begoggled alien named Maz (the voice and motion-capture gestures of Lupita Nyongo although why the most beautiful woman in the world was not cast as the most beautiful woman in the galaxy is a question that needs to be asked of Abrams). And hence an endgame strategy that involves a slim-chance seemingly suicidal fighter squadron attack on the enormous enemy mothership - not the Death Star but an even bigger more terrifying thing called Starkiller Base. And what of Luke Skywalker you ask? The fledgling hero of 1977s Star Wars is pivotal to The Force Awakens for reasons that move the plot from one corner of the universe to another pitting good against evil and prompting Rey and Finn to pick up a lightsaber and wield it against an enemys similarly illuminated blade. As for the two Brits cast as Rey and Finn the former Ridley surely must hold diplomas from the Keira Knightley School of Veddy English Pluck and Boyega is charismatic proves nimble while dodging artillery fire and delivers his snappy quips deadpan-style. Both are signed on to Star Wars Episode VIII set for a May 26 2017 release. May the Force be with them.

With that in mind here goes ... You love Star Wars. I know. So does director J.J. Abrams. Thats why Episode VII of the cherished franchise is a hugely entertaining victory for the masses. Thrilling and knowing in all the right places its sure to satisfy fans that have breathlessly awaited its arrival for years. Unfamiliar with Jedi lore? You too will give in to the force of cinematic excellence.Because I want to live to see Episode VIII rest assured this is a spoiler-free review. You will not read here about [redacted] or [redacted]. However I must underline a crucial point Though original trilogy icons Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are top-billed in the credits this movie -- not to mention the future of the saga -- belongs to the newbies. Best and Worst Movie Remakes The standout is Daisy Ridley as a scavenger named Rey. As she tells it her parents abandoned her in a junkyard when she was a child. Shes feisty and instantly likable. Her partner is John Boyegas former Stormtropper Finn. Early on he symbolically takes off his helmet goes rogue and fights for the good guys. Along with an adorable droid named BB-8 Rey and Finn help the Resistance on a ... shall we say an A-list mission. During this heros journey they meet a few of our old friends including scoundrel turned Jedi pilot Han Solo (Ford) and princess turned General Leia (Fisher). And Chewie (Solo without furry Chewbacca is like sci without the fi.) Stopping them is the evil First Order which rose from the ashes of the Empire. Its chief warrior Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) vows to finish what Darth Vader started. Star Wars The Force Awakens David James Thus concludes the plot recap. (See that wasnt so bad right?) Ridley and Boyega are a striking pair. In this modern era of kick-ass heroines such as Katniss Everdeen and Tris Prior its no longer a novelty for smart females to rule the school. Yet that shouldnt diminish what Ridley accomplishes. She possesses the can-do traits required for this important role as well as the appealing presence. Wielding a lightsaber she gives the cliche ""girl power"" a whole new deep meaning. Boyega meanwhile shows ample charisma and gets some of the best lines in the movie. Exasperated determination works well on him. Falls Leading Ladies Things are more problematic over on the dark side. In short the First Order is no Evil Empire. As its commander Domhnall Gleesons arrogant General Hux borders on the caricature and is quickly forgettable. And Driver lacks the appropriate menacing snarl especially compared to the great James Earl Jones as Vader. At times (youll know when) youll be hard-pressed not to think of this would-be galactic villain as Hannahs boho ex-boyfriend on Girls. Considering his substantive storyline this is the films major flaw. Star Wars The Force Awakens David James Star Wars The Force Awakens Film Frame But oh how the rest of it soars. Commend Abrams for taking the lightsaber/baton from creator George Lucas and fulfilling some ridiculously lofty expectations. Even the most hard-core Star Wars nerds (saying that with love) would applaud the mythology continuity and nuanced inside jokes. And when it came to certain awe-inspiring battle sequences in the sky the audience in my New York City screening did applaud. They also cheered at the first sight of the three veteran stars -- whose lived-in faces were blessedly not given the CGI treatment. (Fords Solo may have been de-iced in 1983s Return of the Jedi but his wry smile should be frozen in time forever.) This has the ideal look of a true non-Jar Jar Binks Star Wars film and thanks to that classic score from John Williams the ideal sound. Most important Abrams lets adults awaken their youthful spirit -- the one that bought action figures watched the original trilogy on a loop and got immense joy out of believing in a galaxy far far away. During the holiday season this may be the greatest gift of all.    Cant get enough of Us?

"Star Wars The Force Awakens | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; star-wars-the-force-awakens ) Star Wars The Force Awakens (United States 2015) December 16 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli It wouldnt be much of a stretch to label Star Wars as one of the biggest cultural influences of the last half-century. The 1977 release of A New Hope had a seismic impact on the film industry and the ripples expanded far and wide. For 36 years George Lucas was the sole helmsman of Star Wars and although there were times of smooth sailing he also had to guide the ship through rough seas especially following the release of The Phantom Menace. But for good or ill all eras must end and with The Force Awakens we have entered the post-Lucas phase of Star Wars. Like the wedding outfit of a bride this latest installment the first direct sequel since 1983s Return of the Jedi offers something old something new something borrowed and something blue - actually more than one thing ""borrowed."" The frenzy surrounding this film has rarely been seen in recent cinema. Only in the run-up to the opening of The Phantom Menace did all facets of mass media go into overdrive like this. There have been some major ""genre fan friendly"" motion picture events since 1999 - Harry Potter The Lord of the Rings and a few others - but none has captured the worldwide consciousness the way Episode VII has. Credit Lucas for keeping fans wanting more. Credit all the ancillary products for keeping the brand alive. Credit Disney for putting their best marketing people and publicists on the job. Demand for this movie was always there; they have amplified it by an order of magnitude making it an event. Its not really possible at least in December 2015 to view The Force Awakens as ""just another movie."" But for purposes of analyzing it I can try. If theres a reason to be disappointed with The Force Awakens its because of the lack of originality. Granted A New Hope wasnt a pinnacle of achievement in that realm either but it felt fresh. The Force Awakens offers a ""greatest hits"" approach to Star Wars - take all the ""expected"" elements and check them off. Its not quite a remake of the 1977 original but the influences and homages are so strong that at times it seems like one. I guess the salient question is whether Star Wars fans want something unique or whether they want to see variations on a theme. The degree to which The Force Awakens is derivative is at times surprising. Apparently writer/director J.J. Abrams is so frightened of ""messing up"" Star Wars that he does the safest (and laziest) thing imaginable tosses new characters and old ones into the mix and has them do pretty much the same things we saw in A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. Ironically the few innovative things Abrams and co-screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan attempt are among those that work best leaving open the tantalizing prospect of what The Force Awakens might have been had the filmmakers not been beholden to incorporating as many Star Wars tropes as the 135-minute running length would accommodate. For the most part however this is a fusion of moments ideas and plot points from A New Hope Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith. The movie opens more than three decades after the death of the Emperor. Although the Empire has fallen and a new Republic has been born the remnants of the old corrupt regime have regrouped. Now led by the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke (a motion-captured Andy Serkis bearing a curious resemblance to Gollum) the First Order has built its own version of the Death Star - something called the ""Star Killer."" It cant move and its not entirely man-made but it packs a wallop. And its just about ready to go on-line. Snokes second in command Darth Vader wannabe Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is doing his best to throw around his dark side of the Force powers but isnt nearly as imposing as his idol (whose melted mask he owns). Meanwhile the droid BB8 has been entrusted with the plans to the Death Star - err I mean the ""map to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)"" the legendary Jedi who has disappeared - and the First Order wants it before it can be delivered to General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and the Resistance. Enter Rey (Daisy Ridley) an orphan eking out a living on a desert planet. When she comes into possession of BB8 her life changes radically. She finds herself hunted by Rens men and after joining forces with ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) she shows off her piloting skills by stealing a junkyard space ship (the Millennium Falcon) and escaping to the stars. No sooner have Rey and Finn fought their way past TIE fighters than they are hauled aboard a freighter captained by the previous owners of the Falcon - smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his faithful second-in-command Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew).  When Han and Chewie learn the importance of BB8s mission they have no choice but to return to the Resistance and face the past. Theres no doubt Abrams wants to emphasize the connection between A New Hope and The Force Awakens (possibly to avoid one of the criticisms leveled at The Phantom Menace - that it looked and ""felt"" vastly different from the original trilogy). He uses a lot of Lucas techniques - wipes and irises and a pan down through a star field following the opening crawl. Set design (especially of the Millennium Falcon and the Star Killer) and costumes call back to Episodes IV-VI. Despite that however The Force Awakens misses in two key areas. The sense of camaraderie that permeated A New Hope The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi is absent here. Han spends a lot of time with Chewie Rey and Finn but they never ""bond."" And as much as theres some genuine friendship and warmth between Rey and Finn its perfunctory. Secondly The Force Awakens lacks a great villain. Ren is a poor mans Vader prone to temper tantrums and self-doubt (in actuality hes a lot like Anakin in Revenge of the Sith). He does many terrible things but never cements himself as the kind of larger-than-life figure that Vader was. One can make a case that the tortured bad guy is a more nuanced choice but in an epic space opera built around the mythology of a Dark Force versus a Light Force it doesnt work. Star Wars after all has never been about nuance. The space battles are well executed and although some function primarily as eye candy (and theres a lot of that) theres legitimate tension during the scene when the Falcon is taking on TIE fighters. Supreme Leader Snoke looks like he could develop into a real badass although it would be intriguing to learn his backstory (Im sure well get it at some point) and understand his relationship to the Emperor. The films new droid BB8 is suitably cute (and obviously designed to sell toys) but I still prefer R2D2 and C3PO both of which make appearances.  There are no colossal missteps like Gungans Jar-Jar Binks or Ewoks. By avoiding those pitfalls The Force Awakens elevates itself above The Phantom Menace and Return of the Jedi. The new characters are likable and effectively developed. Rey is obviously this trilogys version of Luke (with more than a little Katniss thrown in for good measure) and although we dont know her secrets she shows a lot of promise. Daisy Ridley is a great addition to the Star Wars cast. Ditto for John Boyega who gives us a Stormtrooper with a conscience. Hes sort-of Episode VIIs Princess Leia although thats an imperfect parallel. The ""new Han"" would be Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) although we dont see enough of him to determine whether he has a wry sense of humor to match his derring-do. Domnhall Gleesons General Hux The Force Awakens Tarkin is in many ways more unsettling than Ren. But what about our ""old friends""? As each appears its impossible to fight back the associated surge of nostalgia and maybe one of the reasons The Force Awakens will be regarded more positively than the prequels is because they are here. Harrison Ford plays Han exactly as we might expect. Hes the same risk-taking wisecracking scoundrel we last saw in 1983 but with more gray hair and a cloud hanging over his past. Carrie Fishers Leia is the same no-nonsense leader from the original trilogy but molded by decades of war and at least one tragedy. As for Mark Hamill... the most I can say is that Luke is in the movie. His ""reveal"" is as expected a moment of high drama. R2 3PO and Chewbacca all get their moments and theres even a cameo for Admiral Ackbar. The dead stay dead - no Obi-Wan no Yoda no Anakin/Vader (excepting his mask) no Jabba no Emperor. John Williams score wont go down as the best in his long Oscar-winning career. His new themes are neither strong nor memorable. But he knows how to use what he composed three decades ago. Some of The Force Awakens most emotionally resonant moments result from the music. Theres a scene in which a full rendition of the ""Force Theme"" (sometimes referred to as ""Lukes Theme"") coupled with the actions of a new cast member nearly brought me to tears. Thats the power of nostalgia and Williams knows how to milk it for all its worth. The music does its part making The Force Awakens feel like ""real Star Wars."" So whats the final verdict? A mixed bag. Its a good start to a new trilogy but hardly the hoped-for masterpiece. Its a solid space opera spectacle with enough nostalgia to overpower even the most hard-hearted child of the 70s and 80s but it relies a little too much on recycling old plot elements. And I have problems with the cliffhanger ending. (Even The Empire Strikes Back which left multiple plot threads dangling had a better sense of closure.) The Force Awakens does nothing to damage the Star Wars brand posits unanswered questions to fuel 18 months of speculation and satisfies a cultural need. Now its time to see whether Episode VIII can build on this and bring the franchise back to a higher orbit. Star Wars The Force Awakens (United States 2015) Director J.J.

"Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens Old friends and new faces mingle in a galaxy far far away directed by J. J. Abrams. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/16/2015 Editor rating 2.5 Previously on Star Wars At the end of Return of the Jedi the Rebel Alliance blew up a second Death Star and took down the evil Empire for good Darth Vader found redemption and Luke Han Solo Princess Leia and Chewbacca partied hearty. Even the fatalistic C-3PO managed to relax a little bit. 30 years later as The Force Awakens opens its business as usual. The First Order has picked up where the Empire left off threatening the galaxy with an even bigger better version of a Death Star. The Resistance has sprung up to fight against the new oppressors its soldiers wielding the same white-and-orange jumpsuits and battered X-wing fighters as their predecessors. There are new characters Rey (Daisy Ridley) a resourceful young woman living on the desert planet Tatooine - er I mean Jakku; Finn (John Boyega) a guilt-stricken stormtrooper who has decided hes not cut out for villainy; Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a tall heavy-breather fond of dark helmets armed with a heaping helping of the Force and a mean lightsaber; and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) a roguish hot-shot who fights for the good guys and has a way of extricating himself out of the most impossible predicaments. As for Luke Han Leia and the rest of the original crew? Theyre all here although part of the fun in The Force Awakens is discovering what theyve been up to and how they factor into the new story. Producer Kathleen Kennedy who took over the reins of Lucasfilm after George Lucas sold his baby to the Walt Disney Co. has done a formidable job of keeping the movies plot details under wraps - a feat that in this era of Twitter-fueled instant reviews and Internet click-bait spoilers implies the Force may be strong with her too. Here finally is the Star Wars picture weve been looking for since 1985 not a trio of prequels that laid out a story where the ending was foretold. The Star Wars brand carries a built-in nostalgia and power thats unrivaled in popular culture. You only need to see that familiar logo splashed across the screen accompanied by the initial blast of John Williams symphonic score and youre in. Throw in the promise of ""Heres what happened next ..."" and if you can resist that youre a stronger person than I. For the first hour or so of The Force Awakens director J. J. Abrams gives you everything you hoped for and even exceeds your expectations. The spherical BB-8 the new droid that became a best-selling toy before the movie was even completed lives up to the hype Hes a miraculous creation a machine that expresses feelings and emotions and humor through beeps and boops and tilts of its magical floating head. And Abrams knows exactly how to use him as a character instead of a special effect. Keep your eye on BB-8 the second (or fifth or sixth) time you watch The Force Awakens and youll see how even when hes just hanging out on the edge of the frame Abrams is always giving the cute droid some bit of business to do. Thats what one of the things Abrams is best at Characterization. Although every shot in The Force Awakens includes some kind of special effect (some computer-generated many done the old-school way with physical models and makeup) what makes the movie sing are the people. Like Lucas did with the 1977 original the film throws you right into the story with little set-up forcing you to fill in the details as the action thunders along. Ridley a little-known British actress whose career is about to blow up in a major way is so good as the resourceful innocent leading a hardscrabble life on a desert planet that she anchors this mammoth movie with a grace and beauty that feels new to the series. Rey is already a hero when he first meet her - the extent of her set of skills provides the movie with one of its first big crowd-pleasing surprises - but The Force Awakens is only the start of her journey. True greatness has not yet been thrust upon her but to call her a next-gen Luke Skywalker is reductive. Abrams obviously wanted to dispel the vague sexist aura that has always dogged the Star Wars movies and the film shows how easy a thing that is to do. He simply treats Rey the way he treats everyone else. Boyega previously best-known as one of the delinquents defending his South London neighborhood from an alien invasion in Attack the Block has grown up a lot since that film. He plays Finns moral ambiguity and insecurity in clean broad strokes that make room for emotional depth and resonance (Finn is also like Rey a natural-born hero although he doesnt know it yet). Ridley and Boyega make such a good team the entire movie could have been about them and no one would have minded. In fact The Force Awakens loses considerable steam once Han and Chewie (sorry I love these movies) enter the fray. Thats the point when you start to feel Abrams obligation to pay service to the hardcore fans and tie up loose ends. The resulting plot twists and surprises - and they are considerable - all feel with one critical exception like intrusive padding unnecessary additions to a story that is ready to take off in a new direction but is still anchored to the past. And even Abrams who co-wrote the screenplay with Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt cant figure out what to do with Leia (no longer a princess now a General) other than to strand her on the sidelines nervously wringing her hands. The Force Awakens gets the pacing just right - furious but never exhausting - and there is great beauty in its details. The Millennium Falcon gets an entrance worthy of its status as the most iconic spaceship in movie history (sorry U.S.S. Enterprise); Maz Kanata the computer-generated character played by Lupita Nyongo achieves what Lucas tried to do with Jar Jar Binks smoothly inserting a completely artificial creation into a world of (mostly) flesh-and-blood beings; and for the first time we get to ride inside a TIE Fighter thats been hijacked by the heroes so we experience a dogfight from the other guys perspective. There are also of course plenty of call-outs to previous chapters in the original trilogy. Whats missing in The Force Awakens - and this is a major critical flaw - is a fresh story template a plot that doesnt build toward a climax youve already seen played out in practically the exact same way. Thats the kind of failing that a lot of fans will overlook while they bask in the undeniable bliss-out the movie delivers. But in hindsight as you play the film back in your mind the lack of freshness becomes more problematic. For all its secrecy The Force Awakens turns out to be shockingly predictable even for those who dont know Darth Plageuis from a Wookie. The thrills this time come from the familiar not the new. Heres hoping the tremendous final shot which is loaded with potential leads to an Episode VIII thats about more than reliving the good old days.

Its been 32 years since ""Return of the Jedi"" more than three decades of patient waiting crudely re-jiggered re-releases and some hugely divisive prequels. But here comes ""The Force Awakens"" and let the fans rejoice. The seventh ""Star Wars"" film and the first to have no controlling supervision from creator George Lucas its a careful recreation of what really drove his first three epics of duels and droids. And while bringing back the original cast - some for starring roles some for quicker appearances - it also introduces us to three new heroes and sets us up for new adventures ahead. The story - mostly by director J. J. Abrams and franchise veteran Lawrence Kasdan - frankly copies the set-up of the first film. The galaxy is still torn by a war between good and evil; a secret message smuggled out in a droid is the best hope for a besieged freedom-loving alliance. And getting that message out is going to depend on an assertive young woman an untested young man and a cocksure pilot. Its here though that ""The Force Awakens"" tries something novel. Weve seen this trio before - the assertive young woman will be Princess Leia the uncertain young man our hero Luke and the cocksure pilot the charismatic Han Solo. Except this time the young woman Rey is really more like Luke - a smart parentless loner on a desert planet clearly destined for greater things (including maybe becoming this trilogys real hero). And the character of Han is split between the two men - Finn a deserting stormtrooper having all of Hans pragmatic reluctance and Poe the cocky pilot most of his grinning save-the-day heroics. Thats a smart twist as is the casting with John Boyega and Oscar Isaac bringing some welcome diversity to Finn and Poe and Daisy Ridley a standout as the cool and capable Rey. (In the films funniest slap at sexist action-movie cliches when Finn tries to pull her out of danger she snaps ""I know how to run without you holding my hand"") But if these are going to be our new friends for a while the torch - and the lightsaber - needs to be formally passed. And so ""The Force Awakens"" brings back Luke and Leia and Han. I wont say much more - and any critic who does should be dropped into the great pit of Carkoon - but the original stars all appear and Harrison Ford fans are guaranteed to enjoy this nearly as much as he does. And all our heroes face a new - yet familiar - villain in Adam Drivers Kylo Ren a sinister black-cloaked figure with formidable psychic powers a bad temper and a fondness for speaking through a voice-distorting mask. As you can tell he consciously styles himself after his idol the long-gone Darth Vader which makes sense - by now Vader is a mythic figure even to these characters. At other times though the film copies earlier installments a little too slavishly.Does Rey really have to hail from an arid wasteland just as Luke did? Do the climactic battles have to include another pinpoint assault on a giant warship? And must we have a twisty plot which - once again - depends on some heavy family melodrama? (No spoilers but lets just say the Skywalker clan has a lot of issues - and Im betting theres more to come.) Sometimes it feels as if the movie isnt reflecting on the original films so much as merely mirroring them - copying them in careful albeit sometimes reversed fashion with every fond fan favorite quite calculatedly included as if Abrams had a checklist. But I wont quibble too much with that - hey personally Ive always loved Admiral Ackbar even though he looks like he should come with garlic butter and the crowd around me reacted gleefully when the Millennium Falcon appeared or whenever Chewie gave a few growls. And if we can already see whats coming in the next installment - with a new apprentice Jedi Knight in waiting and a new master there to train her - I dont think anyones going to complain too loudly about a possible revisiting of ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Ive got a good feeling about this. Ratings note The film contains violence. Star Wars The Force Awakens (PG-13) Disney (135 min.) Directed by J. J. Abrams.

As production started on the first new offering they pored over every rumor and devoured every photo from the set. They watched and rewatched every trailer and commercial for hints as to whether director J.J. Abrams his co-writer Lawrence Kasdan and the folks from Lucasfilm would make a ""Star Wars"" movie worthy of the original trilogy which has been something of a religion for fans for more than three decades. ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" opening on Thursday is the movie they were looking for. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren in Star Wars The Force Awakens. (David James/Lucasfilm) ( David James/Lucasfilm ) Its not flawless and it may suffer from expectations that no film has ever had to live up to. But Abrams knew what he was doing. It removes the bad taste many experienced in the so-called prequel films. Theres legitimacy -- and fun -- in this film thats been missing from the ""Star Wars"" universe for decades. Many fans were skeptical when the filmmakers talked about moving the franchise into the future with new characters. People wanted more Han Solo Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker even 30 years after the events from ""Return of the Jedi.""And they get some of that. But any worries that the new characters couldnt captivate us were as misguided as a stormtroopers aim. Advertisement Newcomer Daisy Ridley is excellent as Rey the lone scavenger on a desert planet who is waiting for the family that left her as a child. Ridley gives Rey just the right combination of toughness sensitivity vulnerability and fearlessness. She and fellow franchise rookie John Boyega who plays Finn a stormtrooper who defects and joins the good guys have great chemistry playing characters who escape harsh origins and find themselves joined in a bigger cause than either could have imagined. Both actors possess the talent to channel the wonder fear and heroism their roles demand.Recycling many of the same plotlines from the first three movies (that is Episodes IV V and VI) Abrams offers enough of the familiar to let us know he made a true ""Star Wars"" film. A cute robot named BB-8 possesses information that could help the Resistance (formerly the Rebellion) and is being hunted by the First Order (formerly the Empire). Of course BB-8 winds up in the possession of Rey and Finn and so they too become hunted. They are joined on their journey by an old weathered Han Solo (Harrison Ford doing the sarcastic grandpa bit and looking like hes enjoying it) and Chewbacca (who hasnt aged a day). (L-R) BB-8 and Daisy Ridly as Rey in Star Wars The Force Awakens. (David James/Lucasfilm) ( David James/Lucasfilm ) Theyre pursued by a new masked baddie named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a Darth Vader fanboy who like Vader does the dirty work of his boss in this case the shadowy Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). Its hard to get a sense of what Drivers going for in the role -- hes often not as menacing as he should be and the characters tantrums are more funny than fearsome. Thankfully hes no stiff like Anakin Skywalker was but he never feels very dangerous even when hes doing some seriously dastardly things. Ren supposedly has a badass officer in Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie from ""Game of Thrones"") but the role is wasted. And if theres an overall problem its that many of the climactic scenes with one or two big exceptions get resolved a little easily for the good guys.But Abrams clearly wanted to make a movie that feels similar to the three episodes that spawned the beloved series. So we get X-wings and TIE fighter ships squaring off climactic lightsaber battles between possessors good and evil a giant doomsday machine that incinerates planets a swashbuckling Resistance pilot (a charismatic Oscar Isaac) and robots that act more human than some of the human actors do. We also get lots of live action and real sets as opposed to an overabundance of computer-generated imaging. This was a conscious effort by Abrams that adds a vitality to ""The Force Awakens"" especially the action scenes. (L-R) John Boyega as Finn and Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron in Star Wars The Force Awakens. (David James/Lucasfilm) ( David James/Lucasfilm ) We also get the much-anticipated reunion between Solo and now-General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) who like Ford looks appropriately weathered for a character thats been through a lot over three decades. The pair manage to rekindle some of their magic from the first three films even if they dont spend a lot of time together.Abrams answers only a very few of the questions about what has happened to these characters over the past 30 years (yes Luke Skywalker is addressed and thats all Ill say about that). Reys background is hinted at but remains an engrossing mystery that will likely factor into the next movies. And thats really the main point here. Thanks to ""The Force Awakens"" we are confidently hungry for more episodes. This is a movie you dont want to end despite a final shot that is one of the greatest in the franchises storied history. Abrams has righted the ship. The ""Star Wars"" saga is back and we are gleefully in it for the long haul.

Related links Star Wars faithful line up early for The Force Awakens Star Wars The Force Awakens events in North Texas The Force is with these Star Wars superfans With Star Wars Oscar Isaac reaches stardom Becoming Leia My yearlong transformation from nerd mom to Star Wars princess By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 517pm on Wednesday Dec. 16 2015 Wednesday Dec. 16 2015 Sunday Dec. 20 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram J.J. Abrams had the weight of Hollywood if not the entire galaxy on his shoulders.As writer and director of the seventh installment in the ""Star Wars"" franchise he was expected to satisfy two generations of fans many of whom had been let down by the last three George Lucas-directed movies. On top of that with the films reported 200 million budget Disney was looking for something to blow the roof off the box office as well.But if Abrams was having any sleepless nights he can rest easy now. Star Wars The Force Awakens is a triumphant return to form for the iconic franchise -- the best of the films since The Empire Strikes Back in 1980. Its also a rousing introduction to new characters who will likely carry this world forward through two more planned episodes and assorted spinoffs.Set approximately 30 years after Star Wars Episode VI -- Return of the Jedi Force paints a universe where the Empire may be gone but has been replaced by The First Order a totalitarian regime intent on wiping out all traces of the Republic and any form of resistance. They pledge allegiance to the hideous Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis from ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies in another role that calls for his complete transformation.)But feisty resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) along with his trusty droid sidekick BB-8 arent going down without a fight. BB-8 has information on the whereabouts of the legendary Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who disappeared decades before without a trace.The First Order under direction of the villainous General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) wants this information too and imprisons Dameron. But he finds an unlikely ally in Finn (John Boyega) a renegade Stormtrooper who is rebelling against his programming.This is a kick-off to a rollicking adventure that will also include Rey (Daisy Ridley) a young female pilot living alone on a desert planet who soon finds she has a higher calling and old friends like Leia now General Leia (Carrie Fisher) Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) in supporting but meaningful roles. Abrams keeps things moving quickly even at 135 minutes and theres a sense of humor -- especially in the interplay among Finn Poe and Rey -- that never gets too campy. Visually Force is impressive even though it is a bit of a throwback in terms of effects. (Abrams has been quite public in his desire to de-emphasize digital effects.)And there are a couple of big surprises that will have hard-core fans humming until the next film comes out.The actors strike the right tone with Englishman Boyega (from the cult film Attack the Block) Isaac (indie fare like Inside Llewyn Davis and Ex-Machina) and Ridley (mostly known for British TV) showing off a cool easy chemistry.With these three Abrams has found a way to represent a global sensibility without coming off forced. And as George Miller did with his Mad Max Fury Road he has crafted a strong female character in Rey who can more than hold her own in this male-dominated world.Nit-pickers can find complaints. The Stormtroopers are still such poor shots that they cant hit the side of an asteroid. Its a wonder these guys could take over a small town let alone a galaxy.And why would Abrams use Iko Uwais and Cecep Arif Rahman stars from ""The Raid"" movies -- arguably the best martial-arts films ever -- and not have them engage in a little rock em sock em lightsaber throwdown?But these are minor quibbles in what turns out to be one of the most enjoyable escapist movies of 2015. It has enough magic and adventure to satisfy devotees of the original films who have been desperate for a new worthy installment for decades. And it will also capture the imagination of a new generation some of whom wouldnt know a wookiee from a sand creature.

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics aol_on Carrie Fisher daisy ridley George Lucas Harrison Ford j.j. abrams John Boyega Movies new Star Wars science fiction Science Fiction and Fantasy Star Wars Star Wars the Force Awakens The Force Awakens Entertainment News (Credit Lucasfilm) There I was standing in line on 68th Street waiting to get into the New York press screening of ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" (a film you may have heard something about) and cursing myself for being the sort of person who follows the rules. I could see other critics either through ignorance deviousness or entitlement cruising right around the line that everyone was supposed to stand in and skedaddling up the escalator to the theater. But it wasnt especially cold out there because were having a freakishly warm December and the man and woman in front of me were having an interesting conversation.They were friends but not a couple entertainment journalists of the loyalist stripe who wear swag hoodies they were given at studio junkets and refer to all celebrities by their first names. The guy was saying that the buildup for J.J. Abrams ""Star Wars"" reboot was so intense and he had spent so much time parsing the fine details of production stills and posters and the snippets of footage delivered in trailers that he almost didnt believe it was really a movie. Maybe well get into the theater he speculated and find out that it was all a ""Wizard of Oz"" illusion or an expensive and elaborate prank. They havent made a new ""Star Wars"" movie but ""J.J."" will come out and tell us how awesome it would be if it existed.Kind of a delightful idea am I right? And in a certain sense not all that far from the truth. J.J. Abrams is like a one-man industry of cultural recycling and repurposing and everything he makes is in danger of being overshadowed by all the stuff it references. Having thoroughly botched the ""Star Trek"" franchise whose ethos he never understood - yes Im bitter about that -- he has moved on to the one he wanted all along. ""Star Wars"" is a better fit for him sensibility-wise and everyone in Hollywood went to bed on Tuesday night feeling confident not just that Abrams relaunch will be a huge success but that fans will come back for second and third helpings.Theres a movie to see when you get into the theater all right and I had a lot of fun watching it with a psyched-up crowd who cheered the theme music the deliberately old-school title crawl and every reappearance of every old friend. Abrams has his failings as a director - his action scenes are frankly not that great - but by Hollywood standards hes an economical storyteller who avoids unnecessary padding handles emotional beats well and feels obvious affection for his actors and characters. ""The Force Awakens"" is an expertly made entertainment loaded with plot twists and revelations I have been sternly enjoined not to tell you about even though most have been leaked already or guessed correctly by fans.I dont think its any secret that Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher return in modest supporting roles as the aging Han Solo and Princess Leia (now a rebel general) although their scenes together are both wrenching and more than a little awkward. Abrams has found energetic and likable new leads in a pair of London-born actors Daisy Ridley as a scavenger called Rey who has untapped powers she doesnt understand and John Boyega as Finn an Imperial stormtrooper who defects to the rebel alliance. Theres a hotshot pilot Theres a Wookiee There are whimsical droids although mercifully not much C-3PO. (Even a little is a lot.) Everybody spends a lot of time and effort worrying about where Luke Skywalker has gotten to and a map that might lead either Leias rebel forces or the reborn Sith-style warriors of the Dark Side to Luke is the movies principal plot MacGuffin. You Might Also Like Indeed all the spoilers I could throw at you right now - but I wont I promise - would seem familiar because the whole damn movie seems obsessively and insistently familiar. We have known for months or years that ""The Force Awakens"" would be a massive worldwide hit and that would still be true even if it turned out to be about Jar Jar Binks and the Little Mermaid going on an underwater quest for the essence of Gangnam Style. Its the Citibank of movies literally too big to fail. But Abrams has grander ambitions than a Michael Bay-style cash grab. His mission is to build a new ""Star Wars"" franchise on top of the old one and the ultimate success of that venture will largely depend on how the series millions of fans react to the fact that he hasnt just made a movie fueled by nostalgia or a movie full of mythic echoes. Hes made a movie theyve already seen a simulacrum of something that was already a simulacrum of something else.For better or worse -- and heres where my hoodie-wearing friends thought experiment comes in - ""The Force Awakens"" is more like a remake or a mashup of the first two ""Star Wars"" pictures than a sequel. Yes in technical terms Abrams and co-writers Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt are picking up the narrative some 30 years after the destruction of the Galactic Empire at the end of ""Return of the Jedi."" But they barely even pretend to advance the story of the initial trilogy; they rewind it and repeat it with new characters substituting for old ones but many of the same action set-pieces narrative dilemmas and hidden connections. Darth Vader has a copycat heir named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver resisting shtick) who keeps his masters melted helmet around and wears one of his own just to look cool. (He doesnt need it to breathe at any rate.) Theres an orphan who doesnt understand his or her true powers a spectral demonic figure who is using the Dark Side to conquer the universe and a bunch of pompous generals with Nazi-like uniforms and a planet-destroying superweapon. Theres a crazy bar full of aliens a climactic battle on a catwalk inside a spaceship an evil character whose good side may not be entirely dead and the unexpected news that somebody is somebody elses dad. I could go on and when you see this movie you will too. In fairness there are no Ewoks and no Lando Calrissian. And why the hell not?Whether Abrams obsessive-compulsive relationship to George Lucas 1977 original works for you is a subjective question of course. You can choose to understand ""The Force Awakens"" as an embrace of the mythological tradition in which the same stories recur over and over with minor variations. Or you can see it as the ultimate retreat into formula ""Lets just make the same damn movie they loved so much the first time"" There are moments when it feels like both of those things profound and cynical deeply satisfying and oddly empty. This is the work of a talented mimic or ventriloquist who can just about cover for the fact that he has nothing much to say. He has made an adoring copy of ""Star Wars"" seeking to correct its perceived flaws without understanding that nothing about that movies context or meaning or enormous cultural impact can be duplicated.

J.J. Abrams brings the ""Star Wars"" magic back with a thrilling new installment in the franchise. New faces like Daisy Ridley and John Boyega fit in perfectly with old hands like Harrison Ford.Gwendoline CHristie of ""Game of Thrones"" plays Captain Phasma in the new ""Star Wars"" film.(Photo Disney)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4.5 stars out of 5Abrams offers plenty of nods to the original films but doesnt overdo itDaisy Ridley John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are good additions to the storyThe plot of ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" is basically a two-hour-and-change spoiler but dont worry you wont get any information here that will ruin your experience.What youll get instead is advice Go see this movie. Granted if youre even a casual ""Star Wars"" fan (do they exist?) youll be going anyway. But go with this knowledge -- you will not be disappointed. Director J.J. Abrams blends the old with the new along with a fanboys love and a directors skill and the results are thrilling.And this is coming from a fan of ""Star Wars"" but not a fanatic. ""The Force Awakens"" works for me too. Obviously if you live and breathe ""Star Wars"" the nods to the previous films will delight. But even that theoretical casual fan will find plenty to love.Because what Abrams has done is find and return the ingredient crucial to the original three films in the franchise that was sorely lacking in the second round fun.There are some laugh-out-loud moments here but also some touching ones. Happy sad exciting silly -- all that is included along with the original sense of Saturday-morning-serial abandon that made what became known as ""A New Hope"" so wonderful all those years ago.AZCENTRALHow much do you know about Star Wars? Test yourself with our quizSo what is it about? Well a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. ... But you knew that already. This film takes place 30 years after ""Return of the Jedi.""The basics are as follows While peace was returned to the galaxy after Luke Han and Leia saved the day trouble is brewing. A new Force-related evil is on the rise and since theres no point in having evil power if you cant abuse it this bunch led by the supersize Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) is doing just that with plans of destruction and that sort of thing. Snoke is aided by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a tall dude who walks around in black with a cape and a helmet that alters his voice. Hmm.Dont jump to conclusions. YOU KNOW NOTHING.Or maybe you do. Abrams is good at that kind of sleight-of-hand too. He definitely keeps the audience on its toes.A handful of new characters get dropped into the mix of good vs. evil Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) a hotshot rebel pilot; Finn (John Boyega) a guy who is -- shall we say -- considering a career change; and Rey (Daisy Ridley) a scavenger waiting for something or someone.Their paths will lead them however circuitously to interactions with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) Leia (Carrie Fisher) and yes Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) whose absence in the previews was conspicuous. Want to know why?Ill bet you do. So buy a ticket.INDYSTARInteractive Star Wars vote for best movie and favorite characterI will say this Most of your questions probably will be answered. But Abrams who co-wrote the screenplay with Lawrence Kasdan (who co-wrote ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"") and Michael Arndt (who won an Oscar for writing ""Little Miss Sunshine"") asks even more questions.Thats part of the deal with these movies right? Theyre a journey and so is the story. A quest of sorts with lots of big reveals and plot twists that range from mildly amusing to jaw-dropping.Again fun.The dialogue remains wooden in places but Abrams swats that away with humor and a self-awareness among the characters. The middle drags a bit while preparations are made for ... this thing that happens. But all along the way there is actual acting (not always a given in this franchise) and the new characters are not just throw-ins. Whats more Rey kicks ass a welcome development in a genre that isnt always so charitable to female characters.AZCENTRAL10 space movies that are out of this worldAbrams shows an expert understanding of what makes the best of these movies so great -- even more so than George Lucas himself showed with the unfortunate ""The Phantom Menace."" With that film Lucas lost touch with the magic he created.

The ""Star Wars"" reboot delivers next-generation thrills.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune December 16 2015 -- 1037am Disney/Lucasfilm Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and Harrison Ford as Han Solo return for more adventures in ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint This is the film were looking for. ""The Force Awakens"" understands what ""Star Wars"" fans love and delivers it lavishly. The sagas seventh episode races across accustomed terrain with familiar faces thrilling audiences that have been waiting three decades to see them. The film practically pauses for applause at the arrival of Harrison Ford as Han Solo Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia (now General Organa) and Anthony Daniels and Peter Mayhew in their costumes as C-3PO and Chewie. The film passes its nostalgia check with flying colors. Under the swaggering confidence of director J.J. Abrams -- the nerd-savant who already revived the ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Star Trek"" films in grand scale -- it provides far more excitement and deliriously daft humor than the last three George Lucas episodes combined. The Disney executives who paid Lucas 4 billion for the rights to the series in perpetuity can take a sigh of relief. This installment could very well earn back half of the investment on its own. ""The Force Awakens"" plays like four films in parallel (all discussed here without big reveals). In the first Oscar Isaac plays Poe Dameron the best X-Wing fighter pilot ever flying serpentine loops in the favorite vehicle for Resistance fighters in the original film. He joins forces with John Boyega (seen slaying aliens in the 2011 British sci-fi farce ""Attack the Block"") joining the cast as Finn a defector from the Stormtroopers assault force serving the First Order -- auxiliary evildoers taking over from the Empire. The pair launch a partnership bantering at lightspeed while trying to outfly outshoot and outlast a battalion of pursuit ships. The second is a coming of age story for Daisy Ridley playing Rey a woman scavenging the desert planet Jakku for crashed spacecraft scraps with a fine balance of grit physicality and vulnerability. Like the Luke Skywalker of yore she lives among John Ford-inspired images of the arid American West looking up into the sky in hopes of finding a path to a better life. The third is a breezy reunion with Ford returning to the part of the galaxys greatest gruffest scoundrel and befriending some of the new arrivals. Asked by one ""Wasnt he a war hero?"" Chewbacca gives a shrug and a yodeling ""Meh."" David James Disney/Lucasfilm John Boyega as Finn and Daisy Ridley as Rey in ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" In the fourth all heck breaks loose in a special-effects action extravaganza when Adam Driver as mysterious hooded villain Kylo Ren aims to use his dark mastery of the Force to ""destroy the Resistance and the last Jedi."" Theres a nice degree of novelty here. This is by far the most female-friendly film in the ""Star Wars"" universe. It offers the series first female action star (a role Ridley fills with verve and moxie) and its first major female villain (Gwendoline Christie of ""Game of Thrones"" plays Captain Phasma a baddie so evil she never removes her mask). It also introduces the near-irresistible BB-8 the first droid mascot modeled after a bobblehead soccer ball. The film looks remarkable its slick color palette putting the top villains in costumes and settings so blood crimson and black they resemble evil red velvet muffins. And for the first time in decades the franchise displays a touching level of heart toward its leading characters. At other times the film returns to standard ""Star Wars"" mythology like a solid cover band playing callbacks of old hits. If you liked it before its probably here. A big planet-destroying weapon that has to be attacked by a squadron of heroes; check. Family issues leading to a wrenching battle-station showdown; absolutely. Samurai lightsabers ripping through flesh like Freddy Kruegers razor fingers; oh yeah. Another visit to a jazzy cantina; you bet. Holographic chess; naturally. The script Abrams created with Lawrence Kasdan screenwriter of the classic ""The Empire Strikes Back"" whips off parsecs full of big loud excitement yet at times the film is so fixated with revisiting its own universe that it cant transport us beyond whats already familiar. One scene of the Millennium Falcon filling with toxic gas parallels sections where the film itself needs to breathe fresh air. This years revivals of movies about Jurassic Park Rocky Balboa and Mad Max carried their fan bases to impressive new worlds of plot twists and multidimensional characters. ""The Force Awakens"" visits its new vistas largely through sublime visual effects. That said this is a welcome next-generation return for a franchise that has been a key point in pop-cultural history. It doesnt just resuscitate George Lucass most beloved creation it gives todays viewers a ""Star Wars"" that feels and looks like it fits in their time. Not many will leave it feeling disappointed and most will feel prepared to follow it forward into a future far far away. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Star Wars The Force Awakens is the best movie of 2015 review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesStar Wars The Force Awakens is the best movie of 2015 reviewThe Force Awakens is the Star Wars movie fans have been waiting for lo these many years. Its also the best movie of 2015.By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Dec. 16 2015Star Wars The Force AwakensStarring Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher Mark Hamill Adam Driver Daisy Ridley John Boyega and Oscar Isaac. Directed by J. J. Abrams. 135 minutes. Opens wide Friday at major theatres with screenings Thursday night at select theatres. PGThe Force Awakens is the Star Wars movie fans have been waiting for lo these many years.As much a restoration as it is a reboot of a cherished movie franchise its the first return trip to that galaxy far far away since at least 1983 that requires no excuses or apologies.Article Continued BelowIts a complete pleasure to behold from start to finish from the familiar scene-setting scroll -- this time pulling us into the storys central mystery and quest -- to the final triumphant notes of John Williams classic score. The Force Awakens isnt just one the finest movies of 2015 its the best movie of the year full stop.Daisy Ridley is one of several welcome newcomers with a central role as Rey along with a new lovable droid BB-8.  (David James / Lucasfilm Ltd)  Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) return in Star Wars The Force Awakens as more than just a cameo and they turn out to be integral to the plot.  (David James / Lucasfilm Ltd)  In a single stroke incoming director J.J. Abrams has accomplished a feat that series creator George Lucas was unable or unwilling to do over three underwhelming Star Wars prequels from 1999 to 2005. Much as he did for Star Trek in 2009 Abrams has revived and re-energized a sci-fi franchise that many had thought was a spent force. (His Star Trek cinematographer Dan Mindel makes full use of the wide 3D screen here his work steadier and more flare-free than in earlier collaborations with Abrams.)All but ignoring the muddled Star Wars prequels Abrams and primary screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan smoothly connect events and characters from the original trilogy of 1977-83 with the new challenges and players of an emotionally rewarding saga that will eventually comprise a third trilogy. Kasdan co-wrote the two films preceding this seventh episode The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) so continuity is built right in. (Abrams and Toy Story 3s Michael Arndt share co-writing credits.)The seamless way original Star Wars actors Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher interact with newcomers Daisy Ridley John Boyega Adam Driver Oscar Isaac and more through well-balanced use of drama comedy and action is arguably the single greatest achievement of The Force Awakens. So much could have gone wrong but didnt with Fords cynical flyboy Han Solo in particular proving that a beloved character can return long after the fact and be more than a walk-on. The film also manages the neat trick of satisfying ardent fans -- there are innumerable callbacks to favourite series moments such as the multi-alien cantina gathering -- while at the same time not overwhelming Star Wars newcomers. Set 30 years after events of Return of the Jedi the movie that saw Darth Vader and his evil Empire vanquished by the righteous Rebel Alliance The Force Awakens finds new ""shadows spreading across the galaxy"" to use one characters evocative phrase.A fresh band of ""dark side"" fascists called the First Order inspired by Vader and commanded by masked warrior Kylo Ren (Driver) under the tutelage of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) seek to brutally restore the Empires galactic domination plan. They have in their arsenal a planet-smashing giant orb called Starkiller Base that is significantly larger than Vaders Death Star.Opposing them often called to heroism by accident are the ""light side"" fighters and friends of the Resistance (formerly Rebel Alliance) Fords Millennium Falcon pilot Solo; Fishers Resistance-leading General Leia Organa (formerly Princess Leia); Ridleys scavenger loner Rey; Boyegas renegade Stormtrooper Finn; Isaacs ace Resistance X-wing pilot Poe Dameron; and Lupita Nyongos wise pirate Maz Kanata.And what of Mark Hamills Luke Skywalker the Jedi knight whose youthful call to adventure started the series off? Rest assured that hes not forgotten.Dont forget the non-human stars old and new Peter Mayhews brave and hairy Millennium Falcon co-pilot Chewbacca; Anthony Daniels fusspot robot C-3PO; Kenny Bakers reliable droid R2-D2; and a delightful and kinetic new rolling droid called BB-8 key to the story and destined to become a fan favourite.More than this you dont want to know going in but Ill leave you with three final thoughts The humour is great especially Solos sarcastic jabs; theres welcome diversity to the cast especially the strong female roles; and there are no annoying characters like Ewoks or Jar Jar Binks who exist merely to sell toys. What more could you ask for from a Star Wars movie or indeed from any blockbuster?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Close Join the conversation... On Facebook On Twitter With Chris Vognar Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh You must remember this or at least you should Before it became an alternative religion a defining hodgepodge of myth and a heartbreaking progenitor of dull prequels Star Wars was just a great ride. Thats the best approach to carry into Star Wars The Force Awakens the most massively hyped sequel/reboot in the history of massively hyped sequel/reboots.The new movie moves swiftly and with assurance with crisp editing and sweeping camera work. The script nods and winks at its predecessors without straining its neck or its eyes. It rewards diehards with in-jokes. It respects the themes of grandeur and destiny without forcing the issue. And it provides a showcase for two rising stars in Daisy Ridley and John Boyega both of whom deliver more freshness and vitality than anything or anyone in the last trilogy.Yeah thats a pretty low bar. But it cant be ignored. George Lucas ran his beloved franchise into the ground and sapped it of the wit and vigor that made it hum in the first place. Director J.J. Abrams has restored Star Wars charm and updated its original visual dazzle. Like that 1977 proto-blockbuster that changed the way movies are made and marketed The Force Awakens has a tactile presence; it doesnt feel like it was made in a computer and drained of blood.Ridleys Rey is this movies Luke Skywalker a restless desert inhabitant whisked away on an adventure she didnt ask for and asked to tap powers shes not aware of. Within minutes shes the strongest female character the franchise has seen (another low bar). She feels like an actual person as does Boyegas Finn a stormtrooper with a conscience marked for something different by a fallen combatants blood smears on his white helmet. Abrams task here is tricky. He has to incorporate all the nostalgic callbacks that fans demand into a universe that stands on its own. He has to make the old seem new but not too new. For instance Adam Drivers Kylo Ren is a spiritual descendant of Darth Vader but hes also a new breed of villain. Driver has the advantage of taking off his black helmet and using his expressive face.You can quibble with some of the results especially if you go in expecting a Second Coming (in a series rife with images of resurrection). Some of the mythology lacks density; yet another fraught father-son relationship is explained rather summarily and doesnt pack the punch that it might. But I admire Abrams mix of reverence and irreverence; his maiden Star Wars voyage feels more free and easy than expected. Its light on its feet. It knows its way around the modern action storytelling rhythms that Star Wars all but created.Where Ridley Boyega and an underused Oscar Isaac fare best among the newcomers Harrison Ford is the most valuable veteran player. Han Solo still has swagger but comparing the young swashbuckler to the older model reminds us how much Ford has grown as an actor (and perhaps how little Lucas cared about performance). The brashness is shot through with vulnerability to match Fords gracefully lined face.Go see The Force Awakens with an open mind and without expectations of the same lightning being captured again in the same bottle. It is at the end of the day a movie. And its a pretty good one. Star Wars The Force Awakens (B+)Directed by J.J. Abrams. PG-13 (sci-fi action violence). 135 mins. In wide release. Goes Well With...

Photo Lucasfilm MOVIE REVIEW Star Wars The Force Awakens Running time 135 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence). Opens Thursday night. Warning Spoilers ahead I suppose the last thing you want to hear at a Rolling Stones concert is ""Ladies and gentlemen heres two hours of entirely new material"" Even so the shamelessness with which ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" replays the franchises greatest hits is startling. To put it another way its a satisfying meal -- but its 200 million worth of leftovers. Writer-director J.J. Abrams has done an honorable job and steered things away from those horrid prequels. ""The Force Awakens"" feels like a genuine ""Star Wars"" movie with well-executed battle scenes light comic touches and a warm feel for its characters. Yet right about the time I was thinking ""Surely theyd never trot out another Death Star"" they trotted out another Death Star. Theres also another dramatic confrontation on a catwalk another wise old soul who urges the heroes to return to Jedi ways a ""These are not the droids youre looking for"" moment another Empire (renamed the First Order) another Emperor (the Supreme Leader) another Darth Vader type (Ren played by Adam Driver) and a starting point that kicks us back to the beginning of the original film The Jedi are nearly extinct and the Empire (oops First Order) is being completely unreasonable. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) with Stormtroopers in ""Star Wars The Force Awakens""Photo Lucasfilm Luke (Mark Hamill) has disappeared after a catastrophe occurs at Jedi school leaving the rebels to be led by now-General Leia (Carrie Fisher). Ren wants to crush the rebellion by finding the droid BB-8 in which a cocky rebel pilot (Oscar Isaac) is storing a map to Lukes location. The little bot is discovered on a desert planet by a scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) who joins forces with a reformed ex-Stormtrooper (John Boyega). The movie is at its best in its class-reunion moments Fisher and Hamill lend a spark when their characters appear and Harrison Ford gives the movie lots of heart by reprising Han Solo once again on the run from intergalactic loan sharks. Still the single most thrilling part of the film is either the discovery of an inanimate object in a junkyard or simply the brass fanfare over the opening titles. The bit thats supposed to be most surprising is completely predictable. Abrams does have some spiffy new ideas but he doesnt do enough with them Having a Stormtrooper turn traitor is brilliant but Abrams essentially just flips the guys good/evil switch. Creating character depth is not among Abrams strengths. Moreover Boyega doesnt give Finn much heft and he falls awkwardly between comic relief and omnicompetent hero. I couldnt tell whether there was supposed to be a romantic spark between Rey and Finn but if so their passion is about as hot as Hoth. At 381/2 the franchise is middle-aged and no more inclined to take chances than anybody else with creaky joints. Competently running through the classics counts as a victory after Attack of the Phantom Sith but now that ""Star Wars"" has steered away from the Dark Side the next episode is bound to be more interesting than this one. Lets just say I have a new hope.

Abrams Written by Lawrence Kasdan J.J. Abrams and Michael Arndt Starring Daisy Ridley John Boyega and Harrison Ford Classification PG Country USA Language English A long time ago in a galaxy far far away a friendly little droid programmed with some secret information is crossing a desert of vast sand dunes searching for ... Do stop me if youve heard this one before.To write the original Star Wars script George Lucas studied up on world mythology eventually creating a trilogy of movies that drew on Roman history Christian myth chivalric legend and Buddhist philosophy. To produce their sequel to that trilogy the filmmakers hired by Disney simply studied Lucas. A look at how Star Wars marketing has changed (The Globe and Mail) The much-anticipated Star Wars The Force Awakens continually reprises plots and themes from the first three movies. It tells a well-crafted story; the new characters are invigorating; the old characters are reintroduced tidily. But it is also far too enamoured with the power of its own history. Apparently anything that costs 4-billion - thats the price Disney paid for Lucasfilm - must be mythic.The movie begins once again with an isolated hero on a desert planet This time shes Rey (Daisy Ridley) a plucky orphan who makes her living scavenging scrap. When a spherical droid named BB-8 (the app-enabled toy is already on sale) and a deserting storm trooper named Finn (John Boyega) land in her lap she is drawn into a mysterious quest and enlisted in a battle against an evil organization called the First Order that is run by a guy in a black mask. Rey and Finn soon meet up with the famed Han Solo and Chewbacca still out there flying around the galaxy - Harrison Ford and Peter Mayhew reprise those roles - and so a familiar team of idealists and opportunists is assembled.Like many a Christian philosopher before them director J.J. Abrams and his fellow scriptwriters Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan (who also co-wrote The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) struggle most of all to find a plausible explanation for the existence of evil. First of all the movie simply winds back the clock A power that looks and sounds just like the old Empire has somehow emerged; the Rebels are fighting it again and the Republic they restored now seems invisible.To be fair to Revenge of the Sith the third and least noxious instalment in Lucass cash-grabbing prequel trilogy of the early 2000s it contained a rather complex backstory for the emergence of Darth Vader showing an unusual attention to motivation in a genre where most bad guys just are. Here elements of that story are repeated but the new one turns out to be a pale imitation of the original while his overlord is downright laughable. Despite a fine performance from the always admirable Adam Driver as one of the villains the baddies feel under-written and when Abrams whips up a Nuremberg-style rally of storm troopers complete with red-and-black banners a critic must cry foul. A director has to earn his Nazi iconography.The forces of lightness fare better. Refreshingly this is a sci-fi action movie in which the main character Rey is a woman and Ridley makes her a person of both grit and gravity. Boyega successfully plays her Han - that is to say her brash yet more uncertain sidekick. And the real Han is nicely integrated into the story with Ford happily winking away at a knowing audience. This is one area where trading on the audiences affection for the franchise feels more friendly than exploitative although Carrie Fishers appearance as General Leia still commanding that Rebel army is also well handled. Meanwhile the elusive Luke Skywalker appears in a manner that suggests Disney is saving Mark Hamill for subsequent movies.Another welcome character is Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyongo) a wise old woman - well she is a short female creature with a large but wizened face and huge eyes further enlarged with magnifying goggles. The doyenne of one of those Star Wars watering holes filled with all the riff-raff of several species she is the only interesting non-humanoid here.Abramss team seems determined that it will not repeat the mistake of creating another Jar Jar Binks - the grotesquely unfunny alien minstrel who appeared in the prequel movies - but instead doesnt invent many intriguing new creatures at all. ""Do no harm to the franchise"" seems a pretty low artistic barrier for a director to set.Similarly the various battles with the First Order replay stuff weve all seen before whether the fighters are exploding out in space or skimming across planets that enjoy a checklist of climactic conditions and geography. This film is much less CGI-obsessed than the prequel trilogy which was always gazing longingly into gorgeously detailed space cities but it doesnt have any startling new effects in its toolkit.A viewer who had somehow never seen a previous Star Wars movie might find The Force Awakens entertaining even if he didnt quite follow the Skywalker family tree or get the in-jokes about trash compactors and black masks. But most audiences are well acquainted with the franchise and will find lots of pleasantly familiar tropes here but little gripping innovation. Some may thrill with delighted recognition at the spectacle of yet another primal duel fought over a great void. Others though may know that the real test of myth-making lies in an ability not to repeat but to reinvent.

"Star Wars The Force Awakens covers all its bases but soars only in certain places - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Star Wars The Force Awakens Was it worth the wait? Star Wars The Force Awakens movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Star Wars The Force Awakens starring Daisy Ridley John Boyega and Harrison Ford. Video by Jason H. Neubert Kenneth Turan reviews Star Wars The Force Awakens starring Daisy Ridley John Boyega and Harrison Ford. Video by Jason H. Neubert Kenneth Turan Can the eager first-day viewers of the ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" trailer who saw it 112 million times online be all wrong? What about the true believers who purchased 50 million and counting worth of advance tickets -- can they be mistaken about this film too?No theyre not but they can be only half-right which is what they turn out to be. FULL COVERAGE Star Wars The Force AwakensPerhaps inevitably this the most hotly anticipated motion picture since ""Gone With the Wind"" has an erratic haphazard quality to it. Though a definite improvement on the last three abortive ""Star Wars"" prequels directed by series creator George Lucas ""The Force Awakens"" is only at its best in fits and starts its success dependent on who of its mix of franchise veterans and first-timers is on the screen. Check out images of the Hollywood premiere of ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" Read a recap of the world premiere that includes celebrity cosplay on the red carpet and first reactions. Director J.J. Abrams and fellow screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt have come up with some potent new characters and outstanding moments. When all goes as partisans hoped it would youre glad youre in the room.But ""The Force Awakens"" is also burdened by casting miscalculations and scenes that are flat and ineffective. Sometimes the Force is with this film sometimes it decidedly is not.That hit-and-miss quality was likely unavoidable given that Abrams and company needed to please different masters and satisfy diverse audiences in this story (set 30 years after ""Return of the Jedi"") of a search for mysteriously missing Luke Skywalker part of an ongoing battle between good and evil.Job One was passing the ""Star Wars"" torch to a new generation of actors while simultaneously ensuring that appropriate respect be paid to those whod come before and helped the series earn 4.4 billion in worldwide gross. And both of those had to be done in the context of a story line that fit within an established cosmos bound by a lot of rules and conventions. 4 biggest takeaways from the premiere of Star Wars The Force Awakens Meredith Woerner More than three thousand critics reporters celebrities and movie makers piled into multiple Hollywood theaters Monday night to see the U.S. premiere of ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" Heres our completely spoiler-free look at the brand-new ""Star Wars"" movie and the night that made Hollywood... More than three thousand critics reporters celebrities and movie makers piled into multiple Hollywood theaters Monday night to see the U.S. premiere of ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" Heres our completely spoiler-free look at the brand-new ""Star Wars"" movie and the night that made Hollywood... (Meredith Woerner) What this meant in practice is an overcomplicated plot and characters that carefully echo the first three ""Star Wars"" movies sometimes in the look and style of particular individuals and sometimes at its most forced in positing actual blood relationships between young and old.At its best however ""The Force Awakens"" basks in the presence of an altogether splendid Harrison Ford who unlike original costars Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill has a full-fledged rip-roaring leading role rather than a cameo. Until he checks in midway through the film appropriately craggy and battle weary and elevates everyones game the pickings are slim.""The Force Awakens"" begins with that familiar crawl placing events ""a long time ago in a galaxy far far away"" followed by even more words bringing us up to speed. The evil Empire has been replaced by the even more evil First Order the Republic continues to fight the good fight and everyone wonders where Luke Skywalker has been hiding for all these years.The plot begins with ace Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) making a trip to the junkyard planet of Jakku to get a device with clues about Skywalker from local elder Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow of all people).

See more videos On the verge of being captured by major evildoer and Darth Vader wanna-be Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) Poe secretes the device inside a cute little rolling droid named BB-8 and tells it to keep out of trouble. Fat chance.Helping Poe escape from the evildoers including Domhnall Gleesons General Hux is Finn (John Boyega of ""Attack the Block"") a former Stormtrooper who has had enough of the First Order ordering him around. Both men return to Jakku so Poe can retrieve the device. They get separated and Finn runs into the brightest of the films new cast members young British actress Daisy Ridley who plays a Jakku scavenger named Rey.For if Isaac perfectly cast in the Coen Brothers ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" has too sour a persona here and if Boyega frankly seems out of his depth Ridleys spunky daredevil presence is exactly what the part calls for.Also inspired are a pair of motion-capture performances. On the dark side the great Andy Serkis gives us a sense of what thinking outside the box visually looks like with First Order top dog Supreme Leader Snoke. Pitching for the good guys is Oscar-winning Lupita Nyongo who shines as 1000-year-old Maz Kanata who runs a rowdy establishment strongly reminiscent of the first films Mos Eisley Cantina. See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link At a certain point Rey and Finn get hold of the legendary aircraft Millennium Falcon and team up with the ships original crew Solo and the redoubtable Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the action begins in earnest.Ford has been here before and it shows. His ""Its all true"" speech featured in the trailer is a highlight and his scene kinda offering Rey a job is the films intergenerational high spot. Too bad all of ""The Force Awakens"" cant be that way but even in galaxies far far away things dont always go as planned.MOREStar Wars The Force Awakens A recap of the world premiere from celebrity cosplay on the red carpet to the first reactions The women of Star Wars speak out about their new Empire J.J.

With a cast of entertaining new characters heartfelt scenes huge planetary battles and no qualms about being very funny or very dark at times director J.J. Abrams Star Wars The Force Awakens ( out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday with preview screenings Thursday night) returns the iconic sci-fi franchise to a glorious place that hasnt been seen since Ewoks danced off into victory in Return of the Jedi 32 years ago.The galaxy far far away has taken a downturn since the Galactic Empire was defeated. The last three decades have not been kind to Han Solo (Harrison Ford) Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess -- now General -- Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher).

Its time to return to a galaxy far far away. With Star Wars The Force Awakens hitting theaters Dec. 18 USA TODAYs Kelly Lawler takes a look at some of the images from the movie that will see the return of Luke Leia and Han along with a new generation of the Force. That new generation is being led by Rey (newcomer Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) shown in a scene from the film with new droid BB-8. David James LucasfilmFullscreen Rey and Finn have been the main focus of the trailers and TV spots weve seen so far. LucasfilmFullscreen Rey hails from Jakku a new planet in the Star Wars universe. David James LucasfilmFullscreen Finn is a Stormtrooper who decides his life needs to be spent outside of the First Order. LucasfilmFullscreen Rounding out our new heroes is Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac) who will be piloting an X-Wing Fighter just like Luke did in the original trilogy. LucasfilmFullscreen Poe is sporting the Rebel Alliance symbol from the original trilogy. LucasfilmFullscreen The Force Awakens finds a new villain in Kylo Ren (Adam Driver of Girls). LucasfilmFullscreen Kylo Ren sports a mask simlar to Darth Vaders and a ""crossguard"" lightsaber. LucasfilmFullscreen Game of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie will also portray a villain a Stormtrooper known as Captain Phasma. LucasfilmFullscreen Domhnall Gleeson (who has already taken on a part in an iconic franchise as Bill Weasley in the Harry Potter series) will play baddie General Hux. LucasfilmFullscreen Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is making a big comeback in the new film. LucasfilmFullscreen Fans havent seen much of Luke in the trailers and images from the film so far but they have gotten a glimpse of Leia (Carrie Fisher) who now goes by General Leia. LucasfilmFullscreen We dont know what happened to Han and Leia since we last saw them in Return of the Jedi although it seems from the trailers that theyre still together. LucasfilmFullscreen Han and Chewie (returning star Peter Mayhew) are definitely still hanging together in the new film. LucasfilmFullscreen R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are also making a comeback. The droids are the only characters to be played by the same actors in all seven Star Wars films. LucasfilmFullscreen The iconic Millennium Falcon will be back in action in The Force Awakens... LucasfilmFullscreen And so will the X-Wing fighters... LucasfilmFullscreen And the TIE Fighters. LucasfilmFullscreen The Star Destroyer on the other hand has seen better days. LucasfilmFullscreen Rey is seen scavenging through a downed Star Destroyer in the third trailer. LucasfilmFullscreen The film will introduce new tech to the galaxy including Reys speeder. LucasfilmFullscreen Rolling droid BB-8 is already a fan favorite after very memorable appearances in the trailers and at fan conventions. LucasfilmFullscreen The new movie will also introduce plenty of new aliens and characters like this guy... LucasfilmFullscreen And these guys. LucasfilmFullscreen The classic Stormtrooper costumes get a makeover for new evil organization the First Order. David JamesFullscreen Flamethrowers are also a new weapon in the Stormtrooper arsenal. LucasfilmFullscreen Based on the trailers so far it seems Finn gets stranded on Jakku... LucasfilmFullscreen ...where he teams up with Rey. LucasfilmFullscreen The pair eventually find their way to Han and Chewie. LucasfilmFullscreen And also Poe Dameron. LucasfilmFullscreen At some point Finn nabs himself a lightsaber (which fans have noted is blue like the one Luke wielded in A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back.) LucasfilmFullscreen It all comes together in the official poster for the film. LucasfilmFullscreenLike this topic?

Finn (John Boyega) is a Stormtrooper who cant kill on his first time out and while helping new ally Poe out of a jam he ends up on the desert planet Jakku. And Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a lonely Jakku scavenger who lives in the ruins of an AT-AT (those Imperial Walkers from TheEmpire Strikes Back) and trades junk for food.Ridley brings a lot of pathos to Rey while also giving her a strong sense of naivete at first which plays into her being the Luke of this new trilogy. (By the end of the movie pretty much everybody is going to want a Rey action figure guaranteed.)USA TODAYBox office awaits show of Star Wars force The dynamic between her and Finn is something new for Star Wars with her bright-eyed heroism complementing Boyegas roguish wit. They wind up in the Millennium Falcon and run into its old owner Han Solo beginning a sequence where secrets come alive and the kids get a sense of how epic their battle for survival really is.Isaac is fantastic as flyboy Poe who has a swagger reminiscent of Ford from the original films. Audiences will miss him when hes not around. Just as good is Driver whos a different and more petulant take on the Vader villain template but finds a way to be even more menacing when he takes off his dented mask.While Abrams uses many of the legacy players sparingly and thankfully never lets them overshadow the newcomers he gives Ford time to shine and really do something neat with a man who has reverted to his smuggler days. The aging Solo has much more gravitas but still has a way with one-liners courtesy of Abrams and Lawrence Kasdans script. Gone is the clunky dialogue of the prequels -- instead its replaced by some seriously clever writing that often leads to nice little moments many with Han and Finn.USA TODAYStar Wars premiere Droids wookiees and Han SoloThe Force Awakens leans heavily into shades of Star Wars past and isnt shy about that in the least. There are visually spectacular dogfights between X-wings and TIE Fighters set to John Williams sparkling score; another overarching bad guy who uses holograms Supreme Leader Snoke (played via motion capture by Andy Serkis) a nasty figure along the lines of the late Emperor; and Starkiller Base which makes the Death Star look like a Fisher-Price My First Space Battle Station.Abrams comes close to overdoing it with the nostalgia but pulls back by focusing on Finns tale or Lupita Nyongos motion capture role of Maz Kanata an alien pirate and old friend of Hans whose castle is important for Reys journey. Plus while each of the prior Star Wars movies had a definite ending The Force Awakens finishes with an excellent and emotional cliffhanger that will leave fans casual and hardcore alike breathless for Episode VIII.The Force Awakens reveals surprising connections begins a few bromances solves mysteries while digging up others and sets a strong tone for what comes next in Star Wars lore.

The ""Star Wars"" phenomenon has become bigger than movies capturing the imagination of the world. Fans have somehow kept the faith and grown in number despite weak and worse sequels and now finally their investment has been rewarded. Directed by J.J. Abrams this new episode opening Friday is both grand and human scale. It features many action sequences -- skirmishes attacks laser gun battles and hand-to-hand (and light saber to light saber) combat. But none of it is overdone and none of it feels overstuffed or at the expense of the characters. It is what the first ""Star Wars"" was and what the series always was when it was at its best a story about people caught up in troubles they didnt look for who rise to the moment. The film comes three years following the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney for a reported 4 billion. The sale gave Disney the right to take the story anywhere it wanted regardless of its creators desires and apparently Disney rejected Lucas own story outline for this film and two sequels. Thats a painful thought like something out of a ""Star Wars"" movie -- a father forcibly separated from his offspring. But at least this time out Disney is not the evil Empire. Its hard to imagine any ""Star Wars"" movie better than the one theyve made.

Forever a force united Why watch 6 Star Wars movies? Read Mick LaSalles summaries Star Wars as The Chronicle critics saw it Needless to say with two more films planned as well as spinoffs its quite possible that sooner or later this will become too much of a good thing or even a bad thing. But as they do at the end of most ""Star Wars"" movies its best to rejoice at good news and let the sequels bring what they may. Homage to the past ""The Force Awakens"" picks up the story where it left off in 1983s ""Return of the Jedi."" (Yes there have been three ""Star Wars"" movies since but they were prequels that only took the story up to where the original movie began in 1977.) ""Jedi"" ended with the dark repressive Empire destroyed and the rebels victorious. The rebels were led by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher); her Jedi Knight brother Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill); and her rakish lover Han Solo (Harrison Ford). The opening scroll fills in the last 30 years. As in the original the words scroll up on a slant against an outer space background something innovative in 1977 that looks charmingly low-tech today. In a nutshell the former rebels -- that is the good guys who went on to form a Republic -- let their guard down and now elements of the old Empire have reformed under a new configuration called the First Order. This evil entity is gaining in power and poses a threat to peaceful planets all over the universe. Meanwhile Luke Skywalker has vanished and no one knows where he is. Everyone wants Luke One of the running themes of ""The Force Awakens"" is the adaptability of evil and how the fight against it is like a lethal game of whack-a-mole. The staging of a First Order rally and the rigid posture and fanatical screeching of a First Order orator are meant to call to mind Adolf Hitlers Nuremberg rallies. But the exhausted recognition that the fight is never over will remind many viewers of the fight against the Islamic State preceded by the fight against Al Qaeda preceded by the Cold War struggle against communism. It never really ends. The older characters know this and they have that awareness in their eyes. Ford Fisher and Hamill reprise their roles from the original trilogy -- thats the one thing everyone knows going into this episode. None appears at the start and for a little while every time someone takes off a helmet or turns to the camera we expect to see one of them. Perhaps the greatest thing about the movie is that by the time the first of them does appear the audience is fully engrossed in the story and in all the characters old and new. Basically everyone needs to find Luke. The First Order wants to find and contain him because he represents the greatest threat to them. As a Jedi Knight he can harness the Force (a supernatural beyond-the-senses source of power) to train other Jedi Knights and defeat the bad guys. And the Resistance (the former Republic) needs to find him for the same purpose to lead their side to victory. Like in the original The storytelling in ""The Force Awakens"" is masterful in that it seems to be taking its time but is always moving relentlessly forward and coming up with surprises. At the start Poe (Oscar Isaac) the best pilot in the Resistance leaves a map to Lukes whereabouts with his robot BB-8 a round little fellow who looks like a snowman. What a perfect design in movie terms -- somehow the robot looks both adorable and like an underdog. Immediately theres a rooting interest. Soon the robot comes into the possession of Rey (Daisy Ridley) a young woman who lives alone and scavenges on a miserable bleak planet. Joined by a renegade stormtrooper named Finn (John Boyega) Rey and the robot do their best to elude the First Order who is coming at them with everything theyve got. Fortunately Rey is not your average young scavenger. She has remarkable mechanical skills and seems capable just on an intuitive level to fly any aircraft. Her talents are recognized by none other than Han Solo who shows up with his buddy Chewbacca at a point when the movie has already hit cruising altitude. Ford takes it to a whole other level. To talk about Ford in specifics would be criminal as there is so much here thats best left discovered. But to speak generally ""The Force Awakens"" was created by people with a thorough understanding of what people love about Harrison Ford in this role -- his irreverence his grumpiness his lack of showy heroism his infinite capacity to be annoyed. Ford is everything in this film that a ""Star Wars"" fan could want him to be. Even if the film were only so-so ""The Force Awakens"" would be worth seeing for Ford alone. Humor and dimension Well leave out discussion of Fisher and Hamill because to talk about them would be to talk about their place in the story. Its enough to say that theyre here and its good to see them. ""The Force Awakens"" has a humor that many previous ""Star Wars"" episodes have lacked. There are wisecracks and laugh lines that are outside the usual pattern but nothing detracts from the world that George Lucas originally created. Likewise characters are not all good or all bad but have different sides to them. Adam Driver is introduced as a fascinating new villain Kylo Ren who like most of the main characters in ""Star Wars"" has a tortured family history. Everything builds on Lucas work and serves to fill it out and ... yes make it better. Its hardly fair to save the visuals for last but there is so much else to say. Theyre impressive and well thought out particularly the lair of the First Order leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). In what seems like an intentional perversion of the Lincoln Memorial Snoke is enormous and sits on a massive chair with a mummy face. We first approach him from the side in long shot and hes monstrous. Obviously hes got to go. Even if it takes another two movies hes got to go.

Abrams The Force Awakens delivers exactly what you want it to rollicking adventure wrapped in epic mythology a perfect amount of fan service that fires your geekiest synapses and a just-right cliffhanger ending that paves the way for future installments. In a way Abrams has accomplished exactly what he did with 2009s Star Trek. He took a worshiped pop-culture franchise with a rabid legion of disciples treated it with respect and made it matter again. If anything the shoes were far bigger to fill this time around. Which in a way is exactly what The Force Awakens is about -- being worthy of the legacy that came before you. As much as Id planned on keeping a critical distance going in to the first Star Wars film in 10 years Id be lying if I said I didnt feel the hairs on my neck stand up and salute when the clarion blast of John Williams score struck up and the familiar opening crawl of text unspooled. Suddenly I was 13 again. About that expository crawl... Ill refrain from spoilers here but this much seems like fair game Luke Skywalker has vanished. The sinister First Order has risen from the ashes of the Evil Empire and is hellbent on finding the not-so-young Jedi and destroying him. Meanwhile Princess Leia (now going by the title General Leia Organa) is leading the Resistance and sends her best pilot to the planet of Jakku to find clues of Lukes whereabouts. Mercifully theres not a single mention of taxation or trade routes. In this new clash between the forces of good and evil our heroes are Oscar Isaacs Poe Dameron the hotshot pilot Leia has dispatched for intel on Luke the stand-out Daisy Ridley as Rey a fiery scavenger who possesses powers shes not aware of yet and John Boyega as Finn a disillusioned Stormtrooper whose conscience compels him to switch sides. (Theres also BB-8 that rolling gyroscopic weeble that if possible may out-cute R2-D2.) On the Dark Side are Domnhall Gleesons General Hux a jackbooted baddie straight out of a Leni Riefenstahl film; Adam Drivers Kylo Ren an impertinent Oedipally-motivated Vader Lite in an inky cloak and a metallic duck-billed muzzle that renders his voice a digitized growl; and a CGI heavy called Supreme Leader whos essentially Emperor Palpatine crossed with one of the aliens from Close Encounters. That may sound like a whole lot of confusing new characters to keep straight. But one of the best (and oddly enough weakest) things about the movie is how familiar they all feel as archetypes. So much so that at times you feel as if youre watching Star Wars The Next Generation. But Abrams and his co-writers Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt have an ace up their sleeves. Or rather several of them Han Solo Chewie Leia Luke C-3PO Artoo and even that old bucket of bolts that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs the Millennium Falcon. Abrams amp; Co. have clearly put a lot of love and thought into integrating all of these familiar (if slightly more weathered) faces into the film in a way that feels organic rather than forced. The filmmakers get what made George Lucas original trilogy magical and they recapture that magic. Its so tempting to get swept up into the fizzy class-reunion nostalgia of The Force Awakens that its easy to ignore just how closely the story mimics the plot of A New Hope. But the sense of deja vu is undeniable. The First Order has built what amounts to a bigger more lethal Death Star. And the Rebels game plan to blow it up is pretty much cribbed from the same playbook they used back in 1977. Doesnt the Resistances playbook have more than one play? Its a tad lazy but you may recall it worked pretty well the first time. Like Abrams Star Trek reboot The Force Awakens is funnier and has a lighter touch than the previous Star Wars films. Its aerial dogfights are dizzying and thrilling and its CGI doesnt feel as cheap and chintzy as it did in Lucas prequels which this film tops in every way. One of my biggest beefs over the years with Abrams as a filmmaker has been that as masterful as he is at setting up worlds you want to visit and mysteries you want to untangle he falls short with the payoff. Whether in Lost Mission Impossible III or Super 8 his movies tend to end with fizzling ellipses rather than exclamation points. But the ending hes come up with here feels so note-perfect its hard to imagine it any other way. When The Force Awakens ends it feels bittersweet simply because you so badly want to get to the next chapter. So yes the wait is over. But now a new waiting game begins...

(Lucasfilm) That giant wheezing sound you hear is a collective sigh of relief heaved by now-legion generations of ""Star Wars"" fans from toddlers to their grandparents who can rest assured that the Force is still with the franchise they grew up on or grew old with. After George Lucass original trilogy of the 1970s and 1980s followed by a mid-career slump of prequels during which he threatened to squander the beloved universe he had created (were looking at you Jar Jar Binks) the stakes are unusually high for ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" Lucass characters and inventions are now the property of Disney which in its wisdom has enlisted J.J. Abrams to reboot the series with the aim of preserving its core values but infusing it with enough novelty to create yet another cohort of die-hard fans. The latest trailer for ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" was unveiled during halftime of ESPNs Monday Night Football. The film directed by J.J. Abrams is the seventh in the main ""Star Wars"" series. (The Walt Disney Company Lucasfilm) Its the kind of high-stakes quest worthy of Luke Skywalker himself and -- as he did with the 2009 reboot of ""Star Trek"" -- Abrams has proved himself worthy of the charge. ""The Force Awakens"" strikes all the right chords emotional and narrative to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new. Filled with incident movement and speed dusted with light layers of tarnished ""used future"" grime it captures the kinetic energy that made the first film from 1977 such a revelation to filmgoers who marveled at Lucass mashup of B movies Saturday-morning serials Japanese historical epics and mythic heft. [Could a blockbuster win the Oscar? With Mad Max Star Wars it doesnt seem impossible.] Whats more Abrams has united the original cast with a group of newcomers who mesh seamlessly with their elders in an ensemble effort that brims with the chops and brio of a great jam session. Hes gotten the band back together in a perfectly balanced performance of oldies and new riffs respecting all thats come before but never getting mired in minutiae or fatuous nostalgia. Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) in ""The Force Awakens."" (Lucasfilm) Newcomer Daisy Ridley shines as Rey. (Film Frame/Disney/Lucasfilm via AP) Abrams isnt coy or gratuitously manipulative when it comes to pleasing his audience. The minute the lights go down John Williamss brassy anthem starts up and the opening crawl begins explaining that Skywalker has been missing for the past 30 years during which time an evil empire known as the First Order has taken power. A resistance movement is fighting back led by General Leia Organa who as the film opens has enlisted her finest fighter pilot to find Luke and enlist his Jedi powers on behalf of the rebel forces. Thats enough synopsis for ""The Force Awakens"" which deserves to be enjoyed with as clean a slate as possible plot-wise. It even seems churlish to go into too much detail about specific characters and their roles in this world of futuristic fascism and ragtag chivalry. Suffice it to say that Abrams has done stellar work by casting actors who will be unknown to most filmgoers but who shoulder their responsibilities with skill and confidence. Daisy Ridley resembles the plucky younger sister of Emma Watson and Keira Knightley as Rey a scrappy steampunk-ish scavenger who befriends a wandering soldier named Finn (John Boyega). Oscar Isaac brings just the right amount of cocksure street smarts to his role as Poe Dameron and Adam Driver is similarly right-on as a shadowy somewhat simian figure named Kylo Ren. [John Boyega Force Awakens star is largely unknown. Thats changing fast.] Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) return for more than simple cameos. (Film Frame/Lucasfilm) Its telling and surpassingly cool that the last time Isaac and Driver worked together was on a Coen brothers film the New York folk-scene drama ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" That says a lot about the taste of Abrams who has a wonderful eye for faces and for evoking the worlds of bygone ""Star Wars"" films while introducing new ones. Hopping from one planet to another -- one a desert one a verdant forest one filled with snow-capped mountains all populated by tribal settlements that show colorful layers of wear and tear -- his protagonists engage in the firefights chases explosions showdowns and startling Oedipal conflicts that viewers have come to associate with Lucass ur-narrative. (Theres even a visit to a cantina crowded with motley extraterrestrials an establishment owned by Maz Kanata played by an unrecognizable Lupita Nyongo.) Most crucially the director and his co-writers Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt leaven what could be a fatally self-serious homage with teasing thoroughly delightful flights of humor. [Create your own Star Wars character] Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron. (Film Frame/Lucasfilm) Breakout ""star"" BB-8. (Lucasfilm) As often as not the funniest lines belong to Boyega who at times resembles Kevin Hart in his slightly manic version of a reluctant warrior. Of course the granddaddy of the form is Han Solo himself played by Harrison Ford in an amusingly deadpan performance composed of gruff one-liners and one or two genuinely tender even heartbreaking encounters with figures from his past. One of the most gratifying things about ""The Force Awakens"" is the fact that Ford and Carrie Fisher as Leia play much larger roles in the story than mere perfunctory cameos. [The best final shot Spoiler-free Star Wars reactions] As for Ford and Fishers robotic co-stars the bad news is that they have some competition as far as adorable droids are concerned BB-8 a roly-poly little Wall-E of a creature rolls beeps and blinks with such puppy-ish charisma that R2-D2 and C-3PO might want to call their agents to make sure theyre in the next installment. Thats coming in two years which considering the films somber quietly electrifying final scene now seems as far away as the Galactic Empire. ""The Force Awakens"" has succeeded where it counts most in creating a cast of characters that viewers can spend the next several years rooting for especially the spirited resourceful heroine at its center. Put another way -- and hallelujah for it -- theres not a Binks in the bunch. STAR WARS THE FORCE AWAKENS PG-13. Opens at area theaters on Friday. Contains sci-fi action violence. 135 minutes. lifestyle true Please provide a valid email address.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a very good chance that most diehard Star Wars fans are going to love The Force Awakens. Theyre going to love it because its been made to their exact specifications relayed through years of constructive criticism and very vocal bellyaching. Gone are the senatorial tariff debates slapstick alien mascots and stiff Jedi banter that characterized George Lucas commercially successful but widely maligned prequel trilogy. As directed by professional franchise custodian J.J. Abrams this seventh installment goes back to the basics of what made the series the most popular in movie history. Like all the way back The Force Awakens borrows so much from the 1977 original--environments relationship dynamics action scenes even a basic plot structure--that it often resembles a remake as much as a straight sequel. But for plenty of viewers any misgivings about originality will go out the window the minute Han Solo and Chewbacca saunter back into the Millennium Falcon or that rousing John Williams score rises over new images for the first time in a decade.Made without Lucas involvement The Force Awakens is a state-of-the-art throwback both retro and post-modern in its self-awareness. It doesnt just know that its operating in the long shadow of a classic; it hardwires that understanding into its own DNA making legacy a prevailing theme. The Star Wars movies build myths on top of myths on top of myths creating a universe where future legends are always nipping at the heels of established ones. Here in what amounts to Abrams and companys smartest play the characters themselves are basically Star Wars fans; they speak in hushed tones about the events of the original trilogy just as Luke Skywalker and his crew hung on stories of how a great Jedi turned to the dark side. Hell even the villain of The Force Awakens has done his homework Dressed head to toe in black with a mask to go with his James Earl Jonesian baritone hes got serious Sith envy.Is that saying too much already? Abrams and his corporate overlords at Disney have been protecting story secrets with the iron fist of the Empire. But this is a Star Wars movie; setting aside the big reveals no responsible publication would disclose the plot is pulp simplicity itself--and all the more incidental for how often it repeats the arc of A New Hope beat by beat. Theres a new confederation of the dark side called The First Order led by that aforementioned Vader groupie and stocked with enough Stormtroopers to turn an alien village into a killing field. Theres a heroic resistance putting flyboys like Oscar Isaacs sardonic Poe Dameron into dog fights with the enemy. And theres a quiet early stretch on a desert ""junkyard"" planet that looks exactly like Tatooine but isnt where we meet our hero a plucky scavenger named Rey (Daisy Ridley).This is where hiring back Empire Strikes Back author Lawrence Kasdan who co-wrote the screenplay with Abrams and Michael Arndt really pays off. Its a testament to the nimble scripting that the new characters take shape so quickly elbowing their way into a ensemble of returning fan favorites. Rey at this early stage isnt much more than a beacon of raw promise but Ridley gives her a spark of good-natured determination; she has personality--never a given in Lucas land--and shes just as capable with a bow as a saber. Her counterpart in another victory for the diversification of this series is turncoat Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) who flees the life of killing he was born into. The Force Awakens under-dramatizes this enormous moral decision but it also allows Boyega star of Attack The Block to play Finn as a kind of charismatic dork quick with the nervous jokes and smart enough to know that hes in way over his head. Even the big bad has depth; you want to laugh when he takes off his helmet to reveal Girls star Adam Driver until the actor conveys an unnerving vulnerability to go with his characters volcanic temper.There are plenty of memorable images too Rey taking a breather against a fallen Imperial Walker half submerged in the sand; Domhnall Gleeson pumping up a crowd of Stormtroopers invoking WWII fascism more bluntly than the series ever has; a lightsaber battle in the snow that puts the samurai-cinema influences of Star Wars front and center. Abrams whose style has expanded exponentially from its televisual roots has done slavish imitation before in the synthetic nostalgia object Super 8. But he more soulfully mimics early Lucas than early Spielberg. That means shooting on 35mm to recreate the texture of the original trilogy as well as to distinguish from the blatantly digital aesthetic of the prequels. It also means reproducing the dustier rustier more handmade quality of Lucas landfill universe--a look that Abrams salutes with every beat-up landspeeder (CGI or not) and cluttered cockpit. (Even the BB-8 that roly-poly droid coming to your kids toy box this Christmas looks like something you could pick up with your hands.)The Lost creator does have a weakness for winking callbacks which can be good for a laugh as when Rey dismisses a certain iconic ship as old ""garbage"" but can also lead to instances of glib pandering. (As in Star Trek Into Darkness which was a clear dry run for this gig Abrams botches his most potentially affecting scene by turning it into a big re-creation of one of the franchises most famous moments.) But his affection for his adopted sandbox is never less than clear; if The Force Awakens often feels like savvy fan service shuffling through a greatest-hits collection of familiar scenarios it also plays most of its grace notes with honesty. Yes putting Harrison Ford back in that old jacket (""Its new"" Han insists) is a foolproof recipe for applause. But theres nothing canned about the older wiser charm the actor brings to this aged Han Solo and seeing the character reunite with Carrie Fishers battle-hardened Leia doesnt lose any of its poignancy for being an easy lay-up.What Abrams has done is strip Star Wars down to its core components rearranging the stuff people liked about the original trilogy and getting rid of what they hated about the rest. (Dont hold your breath for a Jar Jar cameo in other words.) But the prequels misguided as they often were dared to be different to be their own movies. The Force Awakens never reaches the heights of escapism Lucas once did mostly because its pleasures are echoes; by the time our posse walks into a saloon thats just the cantina in a nicer neighborhood the deja vu factor begins to feel as much like a drawback as a benefit. Maybe the cyclical nature of the Star Wars universe--the constant teetering between dark and light the rebalancing of the Force every other decade (or sequel)--excuses the recycled nature of the movies fun. Or maybe innovation is overrated when it comes to a mass nostalgic event like the return of the Jedi. But if were destined to see more and more episodes multiplying into an endless horizon like that mandatory opening word crawl lets hope they find a few unexplored corners of the galaxy far far away. Fans might love that too.For thoughts on and a place to discuss plot details we cant reveal in this review visit The Force Awakens spoiler space.

A scene from ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" Rey (Daisy Ridley) is scavenging on a desolate planet when she comes across a droid who will change her life BB-8. A smaller more roly-poly version of R2-D2 the droid is in possession of a map that may ultimately help undermine an evil intergalactic empire called the First Order.BB-8 was entrusted with the map by Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) a pilot for the Resistance led by Gen. Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher).Her commitment to upholding peace in the universe goes back to the days when she fought alongside her Jedi Knight brother Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the rascally but dependable Han Solo (Harrison Ford). But lately her ties to both are tenuous at best. Dameron has an unexpected ally in Finn (John Boyega) a former First Order Stormtrooper whos on the run -- and in danger of being killed by one of the dark sides most merciless warriors Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).Test your knowledge with our ""Star Wars"" quizFrom the archives Reviews of the first six ""Star Wars"" filmsMeet St. Louis 3 biggest ""Star Wars"" fans Rey and Ren both have destinies to fulfill. Hers involves Skywalker; his involves Solo. And you can bet that before the story is over -- at least for this installment -- therell be plenty of lightsaber duels battles between spacecraft and of course jokes.Perhaps the greatest triumph of ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" is that it justifies the enormous hype. Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan director J.J. Abrams (""Star Trek"") brings fresh energy to the franchise while adhering to the storytelling values that made it matter in the first place. And considering that the original ""Star Wars"" film (now known as ""Star Wars A New Hope"") is almost four decades old thats all the more impressive.No doubt longtime fans of the series will be happy to catch up with the characters introduced so long ago in ""A New Hope."" And indeed its good to see Ford Fisher and Hamill back in the roles that brought them universal fame. But Ridley Boyega and Isaac (""Inside Llewyn Davis"") make equally charismatic heroes and Driver (""Girls"") is surprisingly effective as the sinister Ren.""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" is commercial American moviemaking at its best.

And just wait until you find out whose child is whose. 043 MoviesWatch LI fans psyched for Star Wars What saves ""The Force Awakens"" from feeling like a mere rehash is the presence of Harrison Fords Han Solo -- just the thought is enough to make any fan shiver with delight -- who links us to the story we remember. Ford is as charming and rugged as ever and the film wisely puts him front and center. By contrast Oscar Isaacs Poe Dameron a Resistance pilot gets little screen time. Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff And what of our new villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)? Despite his black mask and cloak hes not merely another Darth Vader and thats largely due to Driver who gives the character a ferocious physicality and an unexpected humanity. Next to Ford Driver is the films most crucial component. Is ""The Force Awakens"" equal to the original trilogy? Fans will have to face facts Such unique magic can never be recreated any more than the Beatles can reunite. The new ""Star Wars"" films must create a universe of their own -- and theyre off to a promising start.

Abrams Review Star Wars The Force Awakens hits all the marks BY Ethan Sacks NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday December 16 2015 301 AM facebook Tweet email BY Ethan Sacks NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday December 16 2015 301 AM Title Star Wars The Force Awakens Film Info With Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher Daisy Ridley John Boyega. Its ""Star Wars."" Do you really need the 10-word teaser sentence? Director J.J. Abrams. (216). PG-13 for sci-fi action and violence. Area theaters starting late Dec. 17. The Force is strong in this one. The Death Star-sized question surrounding the seventh installment of the ""Star Wars"" franchise has been whether director J.J. Abrams would restore order to this sci-fi galaxy and remove the Binksian stink of three prequels that George Lucas churned out in the 1990s after ensuring his place in movie history with the original series from 1977 to 1983. And for the most part Abrams does. It isnt just the presence of original stars Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill or co-writer Lawrence Kasdans dialogue that harkens back to the glory days of ""Star Wars"" its the whole vibe. This film fits into the franchises much-debated canon and is the best installment since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. Rey (Daisy Ridley) goes neck to sword with Kylo Ren in ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" (Disney/Lucasfilm) Set 30 years after the events of episode six ""Return of the Jedi"" ""The Force Awakens"" opens with Luke Skywalker (Hamill) having disappeared. In the Jedis absence an army called The First Order has grown powerful with its most fearsome warrior Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a Darth Vader fanboy seeking BB-8 an adorable droid thats holding a map to Skywalkers potential whereabouts. Faster than you can say ""Help me Obi-Wan..."" the droid/Happy Meal tie-in falls in the hands of reformed stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and desert scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley). The pair get some help from Han Solo (Ford) to bring BB-8 to General Leia (Fisher) who is leading the Resistance as always. 1 photos view gallery Star Wars movie posters through the years FLASHBACK READ THE ORIGINAL REVIEW FOR STAR WARS The greatest odd couple since Felix and Oscar are back in ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" (Lucasfilm) FLASHBACK EMPIRE STRIKES BACK IS SPECTACULAR FLASHBACK THE TRIUMPHANT RETURN OF THE JEDI Abrams has clearly learned a thing or two about how to navigate a space opera from his two previous missions aboard the Enterprise in his ""Star Trek"" reboot - but his skills with a lightsaber date back to 1977 when he watched the original ""Star Wars"" in the theater as a wide-eyed 11-year-old. The original series far more than the prequels informs this filmmakers approach. Theres not a Jar Jar Binks to be found. Abrams dutifully checks off all the boxes for a ""Star Wars"" movie he has the soaring John Williams score the adorable chirping droid otherworldly landscapes lightsaber battles intergalactic fortune cookie wisdom (Lupita Nyongo voices a newfangled Yoda-like character) and spacey Shakespearean themes. Its just gravy to have Ford Fisher and Hamill reprise their signature roles from the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. 1 photos view gallery Star Wars Episode VII A first look on set But at times ""The Force Awakens"" feels too self-referential. The First Orders first order of business for example is to build a Death Star-like battle station. ""How do we blow it up?"" asks Han Solo who seems in on the joke. ""Theres always a way to blow it up."" Finn (John Boyega) confronts Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) in ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" (Lucasfilm) Those comedic chops rub off on Finn and Oscar Isaacs hotshot X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron. ""Is this the part where I talk or where you talk?"" Poe has the nerve to ask Kylo Ren during an interrogation. There are other flaws some characters that held so much promise in the lead up to the film particularly Gwendoline Christies chrome-plated Captain Plasma are under-developed. And not enough script is spent on explaining the neuroses behind Rens epic tantrums. Theres a new disturbance in the force -- in the form of Kylo Ren and his newfangled lightsaber. (Lucasfilm) But those concerns barely have time to register as the movie rockets from action sequence to action sequence at a hyperdrive pace. You would have to be practicing some pretty dark arts to not smile as you watch the iconic Millennium Falcon take off into battle one more time.

EntertainmentMovies Review of Star Wars The Force Awakens This new alliance is strong Originally published December 16 2015 at 1201 am Updated December 17 2015 at 1040 am Daisy Ridley and John Boyega play new characters in ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" (Handout/TNS) This is a passing-the-torch movie but one in which director J.J. Abrams references many of the 1977 originals characters and iconic moments without being reverent. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer When the Millennium Falcon is revealed ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" takes off -- literally and figuratively. Before that interstellar bucket of bolts puts in its first appearance the picture concerns itself with introducing its new characters hotshot X-Wing fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac); morally conflicted stormtrooper FN-2187 shortly to be known as Finn (John Boyega); and most important of all Rey (Daisy Ridley) preternaturally capable scavenger of high-tech bits of futuristic space junk. Director/co-screenwriter J.J. Abrams starts things off with a rousing spaceship attack -- laser fire to the left laser fire to the right -- but it feels like hes feeling his way into the story. And in the process marking his territory with a signature though brief lens-flare moment. Movie Review    Star Wars The Force Awakens with Daisy Ridley Oscar Isaac John Boyega Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher. Directed by J.J. Abrams from a screenplay by Abrams Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt. 136 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence. Several theaters. Characters have to be established back stories have to be hinted at and a cute little droid named BB-8 -- think an orange-and-white beach ball with an antennaed headpiece and a vocabulary of boops and beeps -- has to show up to instantly win the hearts of kids everywhere. And just in time for Christmas too.

Why do we like Star Wars so much? A critics take Star Wars timeline stories from a long time ago Cheers for familiar new Star Wars characters at Hollywood premiere Finally theres the Falcon looking battered and abandoned. Suddenly theres Rey at the controls firing up the engine and Finn at the main gun firing at Tie fighters. And were off. Zooming high and fast and into the future of the franchise. At the same time it feels like were in the middle of a warm homecoming. It feels like a reunion because pretty soon Han Solo and Chewbacca are aboard. Later C-3PO R2-D2 and Gen. Leia (no longer a princess) arrive. It feels above all like a return to the place where the ""Star Wars"" saga began. Because its been close to 40 years of prequels and sequels and endless books and comic books since the original picture came out the element of surprise is long gone from this franchise. This is a passing-the-torch movie but one in which Abrams references many of the originals characters and iconic moments without being reverent in his homage-paying. Further tying the movie to the original trilogy is the presence on the screenwriting team of Lawrence Kasdan who co-wrote ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" The villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is a cloaked masked figure in black with a voice filter. Hes clearly related to Darth Vader but in a way thats surprising and fearsomely tragic. Theres a Yodalike figure and a harking back to the Mos Eisely cantina scene. Rey and Finn though feel fresh and new. Boyega brings an appealing sincerity to Finn a stormtrooper with a conscience who can no longer stomach the planet-killing atrocities of what is now called First Order (formerly the Empire). Ridley is the pictures real find. Her Rey is fearless forceful resourceful and with a hidden side to her personality that slowly manifests itself and will surely be more deeply explored in the sequels. ""The Force Awakens"" is full of headlong energy and plenty of quips many courtesy of Harrison Ford. To Leia (Carrie Fisher) on seeing her after years apart He ""Youve changed your hair."" (Gone is the Danish pastry do.) She (deadpan) ""Same jacket."" Grizzled but surprisingly spry Ford brings a lightness to his performance that we havent seen from him in a long time. Hes had a conflicted relationship with the character over the years (he wanted George Lucas to kill Han off at the end of ""Return of the Jedi"") but here hes relaxed and is clearly enjoying himself. And why not? ""The Force Awakens"" is a most enjoyable ride.

Abrams steers pop-cultures most beloved sci-fi saga in an exhilarating new direction. This is what he was handpicked to do. But the fact that he achieves such breathless velocity so quickly is not just a testament to his hardcore fandom (having seen the original ""Star Wars"" at the age of 11) but his well-deserved reputation as Hollywoods reboot master injecting new life into the ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Star Trek"" franchises in recent years. The result is a ""Star Wars"" film that intelligently (and shamelessly) refracts the best angles of its predecessors particularly ""Episode IV -- A New Hope"" and ""Episode V -- The Empire Strikes Back"" while checking nearly every imaginable box on fans wish lists. Its the ""Star Wars"" movie weve been waiting for and the one we didnt know we needed. Despite a grand chilling opening in which the reformed remnants of the Galactic Empire (here called The First Order) scour the desert planet Jakku 30 years after the events of ""Return of the Jedi"" this new trilogys central characters are introduced in small human ways. X-wing pilot Poe Dameron (a smoldering magnetic Oscar Isaac) listens quietly as Lor San Tekka (Max Von Sydow as the village elder) gives him a parcel containing the secret location of Luke Skywalker now in hiding. Dameron stashes it away in his unassuming ball droid BB-8 just as the First Order descends. Finn (John Boyega) is a fresh-off-the-transport stormtrooper who witnesses atrocities under the command of First Order villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver in a deliciously angry trembling performance). War is hell and Finns trauma leads to an impulsive escape from his ship and back to Jakku with Damerons help. An alliance is formed. Hungry scavenger Rey (newcomer Daisy Ridley) lives inside the wreckage of a war machine amid Jakkus desolation counting the days since she was mysteriously marooned there as a child. Her quiet chance encounter with BB-8 sets up the intersection of all their fates as the First Order violently tracks and pursues its prize. The feminist and racial-harmony overtones of the new leads are clear but never overbearing. This could easily not be the case. Even with Abrams demonstrated commitment to showing diverse faces in his work its still a triumph the ""Star Wars"" equivalent of ""Mad Max Fury Roads"" strong female lead. And whats that empty aging hunk of junk yearning for a crew? The Millennium Falcon abandoned on Jakku becomes their vehicle of escape and discovery. The ship is quickly tracked down by Han Solo and his sidekick Chewbacca who are reassuringly up to their old tricks and a warm resonance fills the screen as the characters stumble toward a shared destiny. Although this reviewer saw the film in 2-D a sense of figurative depth pervaded each scene. Around every corner of the watering hole owned by Maz Kanata (a wise diminutive too-briefly glimpsed CGI character driven by Lupito Nyongo) lurks a pair of strange eyes as well as the promises and risks associated with peering into them. Forests deserts and the icy First Order base (called Starkiller in homage to ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas original draft) hold dark secrets tantalizingly glimpsed. Environments taunt threaten and (far less often) nurture the characters in artfully disorienting ways. All the previsualization and storyboarding in the world cant automatically make these things work with flesh-and-blood actors so credit goes to cinematographer Daniel Mindel for crafting frames worthy of the endless dissection theyll soon receive. Abrams emphasis on practical effects and honest-to-God sets pays off too. Creatures many of them puppets croak and wink. Machinery hums and clanks convincingly. Doors and walls are things youd desperately want to avoid banging your elbow into. Explosions and rubble look (and feel) satisfyingly consequential. Lakes ripple with light and a sense of place. John Williams rousing omnipresent score -- full of alluring new themes and melodic variations -- also plays a key role. It made Lucas reviled ""Star Wars"" prequels tolerable. Here it teases good scenes toward greatness with consistency and emotional heft. Like its subject matter -- a blend of mysticism operatic sci-fi and mythological tropes -- theres both an art and a science to making a ""Star Wars"" movie that feels like it belongs in that universe. Abrams earns the affection we feel for BB-8 the emotive (compared to R2-D2 anyway) droid but also our dread and pity in the presence of Darth Vader-wannabe Kylo Ren. Boyega provides plenty of cocksure fake-it-til-you-make-it moments as Finn but also genuine humor and vulnerability. Legacy players Ford and Carrie Fisher (as General Organa) are used sparingly but effectively never coming off like tacked-on cameos. And Ridley -- this films Luke Skywalker -- binds it together with a fierceness that announces her as a major new star. Abrams shortcomings are of the bigger-picture kind. The script written with ""Star Wars"" veteran Lawrence Kasdan brilliantly humanizes one stormtrooper by taking us inside his head. Its a thread quickly dropped as stormtroopers revert to interchangeable laser sponges for the sake of narrative momentum. A question hangs though If Finn has a conscience and relatable backstory dont they all? Future installments may find opportunity here. Still the seemingly endless notes Abrams needed to hit from rejuvenating a multibillion dollar franchise to crafting a riveting standalone drama that just happens to take place amid lightsabers and space battles would have exhausted a lesser soul. But a great ""Star Wars"" movie is more than just a symphony whose conductor intertwines dozens of elements with dynamic flair. Its a rousing expedition in search of the humanity (conflicted and wounded though it may be) amid all this exotic spectacle. Abrams well aware of the stakes is our able guide.

So exclaims one giddy character in ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" a movie brilliantly calculated to resurrect that myth and so many others for the satisfaction of the widest possible audience. Snazzily directed by J.J. Abrams with vibrant effects and a busy plot that sets the whole franchise in motion all over again ""The Force Awakens"" delivers on expectations with a fun polished space odyssey that embraces the appeal of the originals. The hype is strong with this one but brace yourself ""The Force Awakens"" does have flaws. Its a little hokey in parts and at times distractingly self-referential but that itself speaks to the nature of the material. Much as Abrams ""Super 8"" worshipped at the altar of Spielbergian sci-fi ""The Force Awakens"" shows deep reverence for the first trilogy -- even if it cant duplicate its strengths. At this point of course anything remotely competent would heal the wounds of the much-maligned prequels; mediocrity was never on the table for this pricey endeavor. Acquired by Disney just four years ago ""Star Wars"" needed to build on its roots while spicing them up for a fresh generation of audiences. Abrams gets the job done with a story mainly focused on new young characters while making ample room for the bulk of the original cast and a decade-spanning story that bridges the gap between the two. Todays information age has rendered anything construed as spoilers taboo and those boundaries will be respected here in regards to the movies biggest twists. More rudimentarily ""The Force Awakens"" revisits a universe three decades after ""Return of the Jedi"" fraught with many of the same conflicts found in 1977s ""Episode IV - A New Hope."" While the Empire was vanquished long ago the dark side has shifted to a new imperialistic regime known as the First Order. Among its senior operatives is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a wannabe Darth Vader replete with mechanized face mask. Equipped with a menacing multi-pronged lightsaber and Vader-like powers Kylo leads the charge to find and kill Luke Skywalker -- once a great Jedi leader intent on training more of his kind. But Luke as the iconic opening scrawl tells us has gone missing. His sister whos gone from Princess to General Leia Organa (a smirking Carrie Fisher clearly pleased to be there) has sent the daring rebel pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) to track down her vanished sibling but it doesnt take long for Poe to wind up in the clutches of the First Order. While these familiar names may suggest a comeback for the better-known faces of the ""Star Wars"" universe ""The Force Awakens"" foregrounds its newcomers. Most of the screen time belongs to Rey (Daisy Ridley) a nimble raider from the desert planet Jakku and Fin (John Boyega) a former Stormtrooper who defected from the First Order. Its a welcome reflection of our progressive times that a modernized ""Star Wars"" assures central roles for a young woman and a black man but these largely unfamiliar faces (Ridley has only a handful of credits to her name and Boyega last dodged aliens in the jubilant invasion story ""Attack the Block"") give the movie with its best scenes. Both aware of the ""Star Wars"" legacy and mystified by its lengthy history their exploits provide a handy guide to navigating its latest challenges. Zany adventures ensue with plenty of warp drives laser-fueled battles and flying vehicles howling across many different skies. BB-8 the globular droid already immortalized at toy stores months before the new movies release makes for an adorable update to the legacy of C-3PO. The Millennium Falcon hums back to life this time with CGI monsters hiding in its hull. Han Solo (a wizened Harrison Ford playing for laughs to mostly endearing effect) eventually resurfaces back to his smuggler ways with trusty co-pilot Chewbacca by his side. When the exposition speeds up ""The Force Awakens"" becomes every fans idea of how the ""Star Wars"" world should look and feel. Abrams and cinematographer Dan Mindel recapture the bright colors of the universe while John Williams boisterous score turns up the pervasive sense of awe. Industrial Light amp; Magic similarly delivers on expectations for effects. From lightsaber duels to twirling spaceship shootouts ""The Force Awakens"" offers eyeball candy at every turn. Story-wise the movie is somewhat clunkier. Co-written by Abrams Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt it offers a handful of emotionally resonant moments but mostly just salutes existing ingredients. Above all ""The Force Awakens"" expertly resurrects the franchises simplest allure if not the underlying thematic sophistication that made it engaging in the first place. Sometimes cheeky and obvious but always sincere about the product its selling ""The Force Awakens"" celebrates ""Star Wars"" by spicing up the surface details. Theres no doubting the Disneyfication at work here as the series gets relevant for its latest demographic. The younger characters speak in noticeably different vernacular than their forebears. (""Youre so right"" exclaims a villain early on.) Elsewhere the youth express a kind of childish glee that reflects the mentality of younger viewers. After stealing a TIE fighter and pulling away from his assailants Fin erupts with ""Did you see that"" Many scenes later following a daring escape in the Millennium Falcon he jumps up and down ""That was amazing"" He may as well be playing one of the many ""Star Wars"" video games from over the years. Of course drawn into this spirited light show its hard not to relate. Cynical viewers averse to this kind of super-sized product can fight it all they want but ""The Force Awakens"" is certainly the most impressive achievement in Abrams career in terms of sheer scale. It excels at a form of slick commercial filmmaking designed to satisfy millions of viewers which places it lightyears away from Lucas own idiosyncratic version of the material. Considering the resources surrounding it ""The Force Awakens"" is a multi-billion dollar fan film of the highest order. Even callbacks to the original series that dont quite land come across as good-natured attempts to demonstrate affection for the franchise. (""Ive got a bad feeling about this"" and ""May the force be with you"" both pop up rather earnestly). On one level the ""Star Wars"" movies -- blatantly inspired by silly ""Flash Gordon"" serials of the thirties -- have always played with kitsch. Now they just do it with their own material. And thats obviously what the people want. At the crowded New York media screening for the movie on Tuesday night audiences burst into applause for the Lucasfilm logo in the first seconds. They burst into applause for the fanfare as the opening crawl began. They burst into applause when the opening crawl ended. They burst into applause for the arrival of every major character from the earlier movies. They burst into applause when the new characters took control. ""Star Wars"" movies will continue to hit theaters until at least the end of this decade. Chances are strong that the applause wont stop anytime soon. Grade B+ ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" opens nationwide on December 19.

It sets the tone for a new style of trilogy focused around characters like the original trilogy But FYI in the Star Wars universe it is not called a warp drive its a hyper drive and the tentacle creatures you refer too werent on the millennium falcon they were on Hans trawling vessel he has been using since the disappearance of the Falcon Any fans reading this please dont wait to long to see it because I genuinely let out gasps in the cinema from being spoiler free Reply Thomas May 12 2016 313 pm A good review. I agree with the previous reviewer. an A- would be my grade ould be my grade. Reply Wendy Hansen May 12 2016 313 pm Other than the minor disgruntlement of the movie moving away from the greater ""Star Wars"" universe at large which was announced in advance before the cinematic release overall the movie was pretty great. The special effects were well above those of the prequels the writing itself was decent (aside from those said disgruntlements that those of us loyal to the greater Star Wars universe will obviously have) and the acting was better than the prequels. Overall I think your rating was a little low and Im rather hard to please when it comes to Star Wars - being of the Original Trilogy original release generation. I gave it a 9/10 or an A-. Reply Teresa May 12 2016 313 pm A Balanced review. Thanks Reply JDR100 May 12 2016 313 pm I believe the movie is great for old fans and new fans alike. Cynical fans may say they are hauling out an old franchise just as a way of cementing certain profit; however the way that this has bought back Star Wars fans old and new into a whole new fan-dom is nothing but a positive. Reply Enrique May 12 2016 313 pm ""Cynical viewers averse to this kind of super-sized product can fight it all they want but ""The Force Awakens"" is certainly the most impressive achievement in Abrams career in terms of sheer scale."" exactly cynical viewers will try to trash it one waymor another. I am content with the fact that its tye best SW movie since 1983 so they say. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Young people discover their connection both to a conflict of earlier years and to the Force. Theres a colorful watering hole where aliens of all sorts listen to music and learn vital information that will move the plot forward. Theres a giant planet-destroying weapon that must be brought down. Old heroes will make way for new heroes to emerge. And its all set against a rousing score by Oscar-winning composer John Williams. Stepping into the pilots seat on the gargantuan ""Star Wars"" franchise director and co-writer (with Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt) J.J. Abrams has adopted the relatively cautious strategy of essentially remaking the original ""Star Wars"" (or if you must ""Episode IV A New Hope"") which allows him to delight fans by bringing back the original players while at the same time laying down the groundwork of the new good guys and bad guys that well get to know over the course of the next several sequels. See Video All Star Wars The Force Awakens Trailers Compressed Into 2-Minute Video Its not a bad strategy -- what is ""Creed"" after all if not a contemporary re-do of ""Rocky?"" -- and Abrams and company bring enough verve to the proceedings to create some wonderfully exciting moments alongside the reunions and the revelations. There are some slower bits and an ending designed to leave you wanting more but Id be lying if I said I didnt feel a tingle in my neck at the familiar opening of Williams score. Skip a few paragraphs if you want to go in completely cold but either way Ill avoid spoilers as much as possible Also Read Can Star Wars Soar in China Without The Force of Familiarity? The Empire has struck back again with something called The First Order rising to power from the ashes. General Leia (Carrie Fisher) continues to hold together whats left of the Republic and her hopes are pinned on finding a long-missing Luke Skywalker (played in the original trilogy by Mark Hamill). Rebel pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) gets an essential map of Lukes whereabouts from Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow) but is immediately captured by First Order general Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Poe is rescued by stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega ""Attack the Block"") who is horrified by the bloodshed caused when Lors village is massacred; when their TIE fighter crashes Poe is apparently swallowed into the earth with the ship but Finn must find BB-8 Poes droid who has vital information. In his search Finn encounters orphan Rey (Daisy Ridley) a spare-parts scavenger who has found BB-8. Finn lies and says he is a member of the Resistance and that he must get the droid back to base immediately. After that much of the fun in ""The Force Awakens"" is in the surprise appearance of familiar faces and their interactions with each other and with the new players. Abrams and his writers frequently commit whats become known as ""fan service"" -- dialogue or scenes that are only there to delight the well-initiated -- but they never do so at the storys expense. So when Han Solo (Harrison Ford) turns up and does and says the things he does its fun partially because of the characters history but mostly because Ford so easily steps back into that vest to mix laconic banter with no-nonsense swashbuckling. (His bristly romantic repartee with Fisher remains as crackling as ever.) Also Read Star Wars Surprise Women Account for Majority of Facebook Chatter on Franchise Abrams finds a new angle on the material whether its literal or philosophical ""The Force Awakens"" offers us for example the sight of blood on a gleaming white stormtrooper uniform or women piloting X-wings or the destruction of a planet from the POV of its residents and while these arent huge departures from what George Lucas gave us a long time ago they provide jolts of novelty. (Hat-tip to the writers for subverting the old cliche where the man grabs the woman by the wrist and leads her to safety.) Hes also cast the film wisely with engaging performers like Ridley Boyega Isaac and Driver all of whom make strong impressions very quickly and who are charismatic enough to make us care about their characters -- even with fairly scant backstories in some cases -- and to want to see where their paths will take them. Also Read Star Wars The Force Awakens Is Incredible and Totally Delivers According to Hollywood Stars at Premiere The pacing could certainly be tighter -- this movies sequence involving the equivalent of the Mos Eisley Cantina drags on quite a bit even with Lupita Nyongos heartfelt motion-capture performance as proprietor Maz Kanata -- and the familiarity does occasionally lead to a cocked eyebrow. (Seriously did the Empires architects learn nothing from the Death Stars ventilation shafts?) Fans will be most relieved to know that there are no Ewoks no Jar Jar Binks no midi-chlorians no ""Yippee"" Abrams had the benefit of learning what didnt work in Lucas prequels and hes gone in the opposite direction. Hes also set an interesting course for moving forward with this engaging cast playing new characters making their way through this beloved universe.

Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and Harrison Ford as Han Solo in ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" (Film Frame / AP) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune So Where were we?Lets skip past the prequel trilogy ""The Phantom Menace"" ""Attack of the Clones"" and ""Revenge of the Sith"" apparently written and directed by droids. In chronological story terms we last saw Luke Skywalker Han Solo princess-turned-queen Leia Chewbacca R2-D2 and C-3PO whooping it up at the Ewok luau back in 1983 in ""Return of the Jedi"" celebrating the massive global popularity and merchandising sales of George Lucas bright idea. The idea was simple and quaintly retro The world Lucas figured might enjoy a whiz-bang riff on the old ""Flash Gordon"" serials. Good guess Now minus the Ewoks the gangs back. ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" opens to the American public Thursday evening.And it is good. Not great. But far better than ""not bad."" Solidly confidently good. Spoiler alert The word ""good"" will crop up throughout this review because its the most accurate adjective for this Disney-owned product launch. Star Wars movie reviews from A New Hope to Revenge of the Sith Gene Siskel and Michael Wilmington Editors note With ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" hitting theaters this week we decided to look back to a time long long ago in an era far far away when Gene Siskel and Michael Wilmington wrote movie reviews for Chicago Tribune. Here are snippets from reviews of each of the ""Star Wars"" movies... Editors note With ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" hitting theaters this week we decided to look back to a time long long ago in an era far far away when Gene Siskel and Michael Wilmington wrote movie reviews for Chicago Tribune. Here are snippets from reviews of each of the ""Star Wars"" movies... (Gene Siskel and Michael Wilmington) Co-writer and director J.J. Abrams was a good choice to take over our persistent national bedtime story the cinematic golden goose large enough to span two centuries in our moviegoing lives. Abrams has done very well by the ""Star Trek"" franchise twice now on the big screen; his other two features ""Mission Impossible 3"" and ""Super 8"" were you guessed it both in the range of pretty good to good. Statistically thats a solid batting average for a mainstream commercial filmmaker.And Abrams who shares script credit with Michael Arndt and from the first ""Star Wars"" realm Lawrence Kasdan does just fine with the ""Star Wars"" legacy. He juggles nostalgia with the more distracted and distractible tastes of a younger generation of Jedis in training. ""The Force Awakens"" ups the ante on the effects; the new lightsabers for example are far zwoopier and more destructive than the older models. The levels of mass slaughter mostly bloodless and implied are on the insane scale of a typical Marvel ""Avengers"" movie. Theres a new Death Star threat afoot but this ones far far larger and its solar-powered. So its good for the environment its designed to destroy.Heres why ""The Force Awakens"" works. The actors all get a little piece of the action. Sounds like a no-brainer but so many effects-driven spectacles really dont care about the faces on screen. Here you get a swell array of mugs older and newer. On the other hand lets be honest The most touching moment in Abrams film is the meeting between dear old R2-D2 and this movies primary kidbait the more adroit and dexterous roller-droid known as BB8. ""The Force Awakens"" opens the same way the previous six ""Star Wars"" features began with the words A long time ago in a galaxy far far away. The familiar rectangular two-word title logo blasted in slow-motion into space by composer John Williams fanfare for the uncommon blockbuster. Star Wars poorly explained from memory Folks on the streets of downtown Chicago try and paint a picture of the ""Star Wars"" universe from memory. Folks on the streets of downtown Chicago try and paint a picture of the ""Star Wars"" universe from memory. See more videos Then a bunch of plot. The title crawl briefs us on the rise of ""the sinister First Order"" even more Third Reichian in design and political subtlety than the Empire of old. Were informed that last remaining Jedi Luke Skywalker has vanished and that a secret mission will whisk key ""Star Wars"" characters to the desert planet Jakku.On Jakku a young Rey (Daisy Ridley my vote for MVP newbie division) gets by as a scrap metal collector. She ends up in cahoots with trusty BB8 whos being hunted by First Order evildoers led by Adam Drivers Kylo Ren who wears a big black helmet in the style of a certain other moody cuss in this mythic galaxy. On the brighter side theres Finn a Stormtrooper who develops a conscience and becomes a good guy in early scenes that are among the films strongest. John Boyega gives the part his all though in this material its usually the actors who hold something back who hold our interest. Dropping in and out of the action Oscar Isaac is a primary asset as Poe Dameron ""the best pilot in the resistance."" Like Fords Han Solo in the original three hes the guy you want on your team the one who doesnt take any guff and sticks primarily to dialogue along the lines of ""Give it everything ya got"" Luke Skywalker has changed in Force Awakens it seems.

Abrams sat across from each other like seeming strangers they had no apparent inkling about how intertwined their professional destinies would become. But now that moment ripples with an eerie sense... (Michael Cavna The Washington Post) Its no secret that Ford his copious hair grayer now plays a major role in ""The Force Awakens."" Hes truly reassuring company laying into sarcastic rejoinders and tough-guy wisecracks (of uneven quality) with the relish of a one-man supergroup reprising his greatest hits. Rey impresses Han with her piloting skills at the helm of the Millennium Falcon. The movie does all it can to establish its female lead as a strong independent character. Still ""The Force Awakens"" allows for only so much disturbance in the Force otherwise known as the Proven Moneymaking Formula. In mostly entertaining ways the movie feels like a remake of the first ""Star Wars"" from 1977. Its easily the third-best in the franchise to date behind the original renamed ""A New Hope"" (77) and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980). Abrams temperament and tastes are sincere and amusing in roughly equal doses and thats about right for ""Star Wars.""

Abrams movie which features Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher reprising their roles from the 1977 ""Star Wars""... (Tracy Swartz) I wish the script had come up with something more inventive than a Big Gulp edition of the Death Star for its primary threat. I wonder if future ""Star Wars"" features will be allowed a longer leash; at one point in ""The Force Awakens"" one of the space Nazi types mentions that with the turncoat Finn there had been ""no prior signs of non-comformity."" There arent many signs of nonconformity in Abrams film either though Ridleys Rey is a first-rate screen heroine in the making. As for Lupita Nyongo whose motion-captured performance as a digitally animated saloonkeeper; Shes more than good enough to make you wish theyd gone another direction.

J. Abrams hugely anticipated blockbuster brings welcome jolts of energy warmth and excitement back to the biggest franchise in movie history. (EDITORS NOTE While every effort has been made to avoid spoilers those seeking an untainted viewing experience are advised to avoid reviews this one included until after theyve seen the movie.) If the first ""Star Wars"" (1977) hadnt already been rebranded ""A New Hope"" that optimistic title might have applied just as well to ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" by any measure a rousing even restorative seventh chapter in the immortal space-opera saga established and now relinquished by George Lucas. Reinvigorating the franchise with a welcome surge of energy warmth and excitement after the misbegotten cycle of prequels released between 1999 and 2005 incoming writer-director J.J. Abrams seems to have had the original three films firmly in mind when he embarked on this monumental new undertaking structured as a series of clever if sometimes wobbly callbacks to a trilogy that captivated a global audience and helped cement Hollywoods blockbuster paradigm. Still the reassuring familiarity of Abrams approach has its limitations Marvelous as it is to catch up with Han Solo Leia and the rest of the gang fan service takes priority here over a somewhat thin derivative story that despite the presence of two appealing new stars doesnt exactly fire the imagination anew. Still the films tilt toward nostalgia over novelty will hardly prove a commercial liability; indeed nothing short of a global cataclysm (and even then who knows) is likely to keep Disneys hugely anticipated Dec. 18 release from becoming the years top-grossing movie and possibly the most successful movie of all time at least until the forthcoming episodes directed by Rian Johnson and Colin Trevorrow arrive. And if Abrams and his co-writers Lawrence Kasdan (back for more after ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"") and Michael Arndt have shouldered a near-impossible burden of audience expectations here its hard not to look favorably upon ""The Force Awakens"" simply for being a massive improvement on ""The Phantom Menace"" ""Attack of the Clones"" and all but a handful of moments in ""Revenge of the Sith"" -- taken together a stultifying experiment in brand extension gone awry in which Lucas much-vaunted technical wizardry and visual imagination proved no match for the unholy torpor of his storytelling. VideoStar Wars Cast Sings Theme Song at Premiere By contrast ""The Force Awakens"" feels disarmingly swift and light on its feet possessed of a comic sensibility that embraces contemporary wisecrackery and earnest humor in equal measure. Shot on 35mm film (plus some 65mm Imax footage) in a decisive refutation of Lucas all-digital aesthetic Abrams movie has grit under its nails and blood in its veins as we see in an early battle sequence in which an Imperial Stormtroopers white helmet is suddenly streaked with red. A conflicted young warrior-slave who goes by the name of Finn (John Boyega) this Stormtrooper has been brainwashed into serving the First Order -- a new army of galactic terrorists that arose from the ashes of the evil Empire about three decades after the Battle of Endor. Doing battle with the First Order are the good men and women behind a rebel movement called the Resistance. If all this sounds familiar the similarities only continue from there. An ace Resistance pilot named Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac solid in a minor role) is captured by the First Order but not before concealing a top-secret map inside a small droid which he sends away to a desert planet. This time the droid is not R2-D2 but an orange-colored spherical-bodied model called BB-8; the desert planet is not Tatooine but Jakku; the human who adopts the droid is a tough young scavenger named Rey (Daisy Ridley); and the coveted information concerns the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker the last of the Jedi knights who has mysteriously gone missing. Escaping the First Order with Poes help the desperate but good-hearted Finn crash-lands on Jakku where he ultimately partners with Rey -- who makes it quite clear that shes in no need of rescuing thank you very much -- to ensure that BB-8s intel makes it back to the Resistance. Staying barely one step ahead of the enemy TIE fighters on their tail Rey and Finn manage to commandeer the dust-choked but ever-durable Millennium Falcon leading to a wild loop-de-loop chase scene in which Rey turns out to be an exceptionally gifted pilot. Of course where the Falcon is Han Solo (Harrison Ford) cannot be too far behind and after turning up to reclaim his old spaceship (""Chewie were home"") he reluctantly joins forces with Rey whose presence has begun setting off curious rumblings within the Force. For their part Rey and Finn cant believe theyre seeing Han Solo in the flesh and its hard not to discern in the young actors expressions a completely unfeigned delight at sharing the screen with Ford in one of his most iconic roles. PhotosStar Wars Premiere Red Carpet Harrison Ford BB-8 and More ""Its true -- the Force the Jedi all of it. Its all true"" Han murmurs at one point and he seems to be addressing not just his new friends but also the audience and with the sort of soulful conviction capable of converting even the most jaded ""Star Wars"" skeptics into true believers once again. Its that desire to transport the viewer -- to return us to a wondrous childlike state of moviegoing innocence -- that effectively sets the pattern for almost every subsequent development in ""The Force Awakens."" Much of this is fairly intuitive It simply wouldnt be vintage ""Star Wars"" if someone didnt mutter ""I have a bad feeling about this"" or if audiences didnt get an update on their favorite gold-plated worrywart C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) his squat sidekick R2-D2 and that fish-faced fan favorite Admiral Ackbar (Tim Rose). But the films most indelibly moving scenes are reserved for Han and his estranged love Leia (Carrie Fisher) no longer a princess but a Resistance general. Their banter is raspier and gentler than it was 30 years ago less barbed and more bittersweet and viewers can expect their hearts to swell to Mandallian proportions whenever the actors are on screen. Abrams filmmaking has enough dynamism and sweep to zip us along for much of the fast-paced 135-minute running time and for impressive stretches he achieves the action-packed buoyancy of the old Saturday morning serials that partly inspired ""Star Wars"" in the first place. At once polished and pleasingly rough-hewn Dan Mindels lensing alternates between stately landscape compositions and nimble camera movements as the situation requires while editors Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey prove as attentive to the coherence of the action sequences as to the rhythm of the overall narrative while making adroit use of the signature side-swiping scene transitions. And even in a sequence heavy with CGI and/or creature effects -- as when Finn and Rey are attacked by fearsome creatures with sharp teeth and tentacles -- the visuals never lapse into overkill. The unobtrusive sophistication of the visual effects (supervised by Roger Guyett) is especially apparent in scenes featuring the uber-villainous Supreme Leader Snoke (motion-capture maven Andy Serkis resembling a plus-sized more articulate Gollum) in which its not even readily apparent that were watching a hologram. Gone happily are the prequels ADD-inducing background shots of spaceships zipping across a sterile cityscape like goldfish trapped in a giant screen saver. The different worlds we see here from the parched desert vistas of Jakku to the verdant forests of the planet Yavin feel vividly textured and inhabited (Rick Carter and Darren Gilford are credited with the production design). But the most crucial component of the movies design is undoubtedly John Williams still-enveloping score from that thrilling trumpet-like first blast over the opening text scroll to the majestic flurries of feeling the music generates as it accompanies the characters on their long and difficult journeys. At a certain point however ""The Force Awakens"" feels so determined to fashion a contemporary echo of the original trilogy that it becomes almost too reverential -- or riff-erential given Abrams fondness for playing on recognizable tropes themes and plot points in his film and TV work. The Death Star that was destroyed at the end of ""Star Wars"" is one-upped here by a much larger even more destructive weaponized planet (we even get to see the contrasting blueprints in detail). The Mos Eisley cantina meets its match in a watering hole run by a wizened old proprietress Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyongo in motion-capture drag) who has some crucial wisdom about the Force to pass on to Rey. And in the storys least persuasive development the famous Oedipal dynamic that defined Luke and Darth Vaders bond re-emerges unexpectedly here in even more toxic form -- a twist that simply feels too contrived to achieve the desired impact. All in all the script leans rather heavily on exposition to fill in the 30-year gap between the events of this film and those of ""Return of the Jedi""; one longs to get up to speed but in subtler less long-winded terms. The movies multiple dark-side-of-the-Force types are also something of a mixed bag. Serkis is fine but not galvanizing as Snoke; Domhnall Gleeson has a few impressive snit fits as a petulant First Order general with one public speech thats shot to look very ""Triumph of the Will""; and Gwendoline Christie is seen only in full armor as Finns ex-superior Capt. Phasma whose narrative function never really comes into focus. That leaves Adam Driver cast very effectively against type as the silver-masked dark-cloaked Kylo Ren though it would be as unfair to say more about his role as it would be to disclose any particulars about when and where Mark Hamills Luke Skywalker turns up. For that matter even by films end there remains a frustrating if intentional degree of mystery surrounding Finn and Rey the two characters charged with carrying the series forward and whose backstories presumably will be fleshed out more satisfyingly in subsequent films. Viewers inclined to pay attention to such things will have a field day analyzing the casting of a white female and a black male as co-leads in the years biggest blockbuster -- an audacious and frankly long-overdue corrective to the status quo quite apart from the fact that both actors are excellent. Boyega so good in ""Attack the Block"" brings sly wit to the role of a soldier grappling with a vaguely Jason Bourne-style crisis of conscience. And Ridley in a doozy of a breakout role is terrific as a young woman not yet sure what to make of the powerfully beckoning Force or of the glorious and terrifying destiny that might await her. She may not yet have the heroic stature of a Katniss Everdeen but future movies will surely tell. In the end ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" suggests the work of a filmmaker who faced the exciting yet unenviable task of partially reassembling one of the most beloved ensembles in movie history furthering their characters adventures in a meaningful fashion and helping them pass the baton from one generation of action figures to the next -- and emerged with a compromise solution that even when its not firing on all cylinders has been put across with sufficient style momentum love and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans. Risking heresy its worth noting that Abrams actually did smarter more inventive work on his 2009 reboot of ""Star Trek"" no doubt in part because he was working with a less heavily guarded enterprise. ""Star Wars"" at once a cultural juggernaut and a sacrosanct institution resists any attempt to reimagine its landscape too aggressively or imaginatively; that may be to the detriment of this diverting first effort but Abrams has more than stoked our anticipation for what his successors may have up their sleeves.

Peg says June 15 2016 at 158 pm Boringboringboring. The movie was the worst of the whole saga. Reason are bad directing; would say the worst of J J Abrams. bad acting like someone said before the actors/actress werent convincing. And the main point of reason Disney. Disney ruined it in the first place because they wanted to make Star Wars in the ""Disney-style"". Think we cant expect more on the next two chapters. Updated info Star Wars- Rogue One which will come in the end of the year in cinemas will be new filmed/reclassify over 40%..... 40% because DIsney and Kathleen Kenned said the movie are too dark and too much action.....hello...it IS a Star Wars movie. not a Disney animated movie. Sorry but George Lucas did a great mistake as he sold the franchise to Disney because Disney will destroy Star Wars franchise because they dont interest on the view of the fans. Reply Joan says June 9 2016 at 241 pm The worst Star Wars movie ever. Disney and J J Abrams destroyed the expectation of most of the fans and the actress  especially Daisy Ridley wasnt convincing in not one single scene. It was the opposite. Disney/Abrams overload the character of Ridley and had make her non-credible and not authentic. It was the pure Disney-style. Hopefully the next two chapters will come in no sec that this tragedy will come to a fast end. Reply Phil M. Kelley says May 26 2016 at 548 am The agony lies not in the prospect of what evil the colossal pseudo-Palpatine-Emperor Sith Master might be up to in the remainder of the trilogy. The true agony lies in not much caring. Luke Skywalker had to labor mightily to acquire his Jedi powers but Rey simply wills herself to Jedi knighthood. Han Solos wicked son is a sort of emo version of Darth Vader whose descent into Dark Side evil had elements of tragedy. We were stunned to discover that Darth was Lukes father but we begin knowing that Kylo Ren is Han Solos son. Sadly the inescapable conclusion is that neither side of the Force is with The Force Awakens apparently having departed the Star Wars Galaxy along with George Lucas. Reply Pat88 says May 16 2016 at 629 am A friend invited me last year to cinema and both of us (biggest Star Wars fans ever until THAT moment) saw the movie. But our expectations were destroyed by Disney the bad actors ( in the first instance Daisy Ridley) and boring dialogues and in the end by Mr. Abrams. In the last years Mr. Abrams has made great cinema with some of the appeared movies like Star Trek reboot or Cloverfield. But Star Wars VII......dont know can`t put the disappointment in words here. Only can say that Mr. Abrams and Disney destroyed a whole world for us. A world built up by the iconic George Lucas back at the beginning of the 80`s. In the past I was a fan from Disney from the character and stories like Jungle Book Aladin etc. But now..... its all gone. Think that was the biggest mistake from George Lucas to sold the Franchise/Merchandise to Disney who rip of the whole Star Wars universe only for money not for the fans sake. And Mr. Abrams compared himself to Steven Spielberg who think about a great deal of J J Abrams? Sorry but that was the worst work of Mr. Abrams I ever seen and I think I will never see any movies in which he will be involved in the future anymore. He takes responsibility for that it really doesnt matter how GREAT the box-office of the movie was or will be with the solding of DVD or BR. Another comment here described the work of Mr. Abrams as ""evidence of incapacity"". And I have to say; she/he is absolutly right in that description. Reply Geri Cicero says May 15 2016 at 611 pm Very disappointing. Rey and Finn uninteresting individuals. Weak and predictable. So happy I did not spend the big bucks to see it in a theater. Reply Zac says May 1 2016 at 939 am The worst movie ever. I first read the terrible comments to the movie and said by myself ""Will have a look maybe it is all exaggerated."" Tell you what? NO it wasnt exaggerated. More than that it was the opposite the characters are boring; havent any comprehensible developments; the lead cast Daisy Ridley - Rey character is completly shown as one GIRL Jedi Mechanic Pilot all-rounder I dont know why the other 2 characters (Poe and Fynn) are in the movie. The so called bad guy is only a spoiled brat destroy on any time he lost his temper some consols with his lightsaber and wanna be like Darth Vader? Yeah in his wildest dreams maybe. And than in the end the GREAT Sith cant win against the NEW Jedi. Jedi in what? Training? Maybe if you call it a five minute training to manage the force part and the light saber fight it didnt take much more time for the Super-Jedi Rey to manage all the secret of the force and beat up a pseudo Jedi/Sith in the end. So what can we expect from the next two parts? Not really something new. In conclusion you can really say that J J Abrams (called himself a ""FAN"" of Star wars) and Disney destroyed a great saga and a great universe. Its the typical ""Disney-style"". And than the unnecessary death of a great character in the end. Sorry but that was the worst SW movie I ever seen until now. Hopefully the next two movies will come around ASAP and that this Triology come to a FAST end. Reply Bill Green says April 22 2016 at 442 pm This review is the product of a warped mind. The author is obviously not a fan of star wars because the breathe of fresh air is more like a stinking fart. The two main inductees of star wars alumni stank up the place as unbelievable attempts of the director and Disney to add to the diversity of the star wars fan base. Only achieving alienating anyone who has a brain. A treasure seaker with modest fight skills is supposed to be a hedi? A coward stormtrooper who has never hurt anyone is all a sudden a marksman and stone cold killer? Yeah and monkeys just flew out of my butt. Reply quillerm says April 10 2016 at 437 am May be the worst cast Star Wars movie ever. Harrison Ford and Wookie did their best to rescue this movie from Disneys PC department but the chemistry just wasnt there. For those of us who were around when the first Star Wars movies were produced this one gets a D minus. Reply Bill Green says April 22 2016 at 443 pm Totally agree. Good job Reply Alex says March 29 2016 at 515 pm How can Justin Chang can be a Chief Film Critic is beyond my comprehension. Someone who was able to write such a review for this last Star Wars movie should never be allowed to have an opinion on anything. His review is the first result that Google provides related to this movie...disappointing. Justin Chang please change your career as this is clearly not good for you. Reply Bill Green says April 22 2016 at 444 pm Mr Chang should stick to reviewing Godzilla movies Reply caustinclark says March 2 2016 at 121 pm Before I begin writing about ""Star Wars The force Awakens"" I need to lay down my background and appreciation for cinema. It pleases me greatly to watch old cutting edge special effects movies. Ones that incorporate film layering puppets robotics and first age computer graphics are always inspiring to witness. I can also appreciate the role of computer graphics in contemporary movie production. ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" ""Transformers"" as well as many of the Marvel films and series. The classics like the ""Labyrinth"" ""Conan"" ""Gremlins"" ""Indiana Jones""""Highlander"" and ""Big Trouble in Little China"" all have their place in my hall of greatness. These are just a few sci fi films with what I consider relative creative demand. The first three Star Wars episodes 4 5 and 6 also are all epic movies. Each one must be critiqued from a relative viewpoint. Technology consumers and resources demanded each film outperform the next. The same can be said for episodes 12 and 3 which are also epic movies. You could say that I judge a movie by these 10 standards 1. The era in which it was made 2. Utilization of available technology 3. Innovative use of artistic media in storytelling 4. Photographic excellence 5. Lighting and set design 6. Tempo of the narrative 7. Acting and costume design 8. Emotional stimulation 9. Conciseness of Editing and 10. The summation of meeting viewer expectations based on the budget and the hype. I also need to express to some that not all movies should be called films. Movies that are not shot on film are technically not films they are digital productions/movies. Now I will focus on ""The Force Awakens"". I am a big fan of Star Wars movies and the franchise in general. After first hearing that a new Star Wars was brewing in december of 2015 I was on edge.Then I watched the first teaser... I have to say I was sceptical after watching promo clips on YouTube and yet still anticipating the film. J.J. Abrams did an excellent job with Star Trek in 2009. The film made me appreciate the Star Trek narrative for the first time. The work on that film was paramount. Still I was very sceptical of Disney and Abrams handling a Star Wars production. Then the ""The Force Awakens"" was out... everyone was bragging on the Movie. I had to see it for myself. The most important part of every Star Wars film that I have ever watched is the first 30 seconds of the fist scene. I was gravely disappointed in the opening of ""The Force Awakens"". There were no cutting edge blasts of space awesomeness...??? At that point I took a bite of popcorn and tried to remain optimistic. A little light flickering and some stormtrooper heads hardly gets my blood pumping for Star Wars. That is what I took away from the start of the film. It felt rushed right from the start. The escape showed similarities to ""A New Hope"" but it was pushed at me so fast that it seemed pointless. There I was with my popcorn two kids my sister brother in law and my niece and her friend... wondering where the narrative was. The attack scene on the planet was weak yet overzealous. Throughout the whole film I never go the feeling that I could stop and be in one place except for the outland pub which did not last long at all. Compared to most movies this was a huge bust. In every other SW movie there is saturation in the settings and the viewer can feel connected to a city spaceship city starship or starbase. Let me jump on to the bad guy... This is absolutely ridiculous and outrageous. The temper tantrums of Kylo Ren were stupid to say the least. It was idiotic and no master of the force would ever act so asinine. Those scenes were pointless and showed a lack of creative planning and improvisation. Kylos outbursts were even more annoying than country pop lyrics that say the same word three times in a row over and over again. The reason they do that is because THEY CANNOT SING and KYLO AKA ADAM DRIVER CANNOT ACT. A little narrative is at play... Lets find Luke before the first order ""The Force Awakens"" played out like a gumball machine. I pay a small attention fee and a character drops out of nowhere. It is fun for the first minute then the gum looses its flavor and the whole thing gets boring. At the end I wind up with a mouthful of tasteless goop and the need to spit. Reys acquisition of her powers was lame. Those stages of the film were predictable. One of the biggest shortfalls of the film was providing only one real narrative goal and spitting it out to the viewer in the beginning. Every other film had multiple narrative goals and very grounded settings. No single actor in the film did an exceptional job except for John Boyega aka Fin and his performance was not paramount. I believe all of the acting shortfall was due to the screenwriting and directing. THIS IS THE WORST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER MADE. The ending blander than stale white bread... Ok we found Luke by by now... Let me get on with my rubric and rate this film so that I can stop wasting my time writing about this atrocious movie failure. 1. The era in which the movie was made. 3 out of 10. (I did not see anything spectacular.) 2. Utilization of available technology. 1 out of 10 (Nothing was groundbreaking...NOTHING) 3. Innovative use of artistic media in storytelling. 0 out of 10. (Rushed dull cheeky and bland) 4. Photographic excellence. 1 out of 10. (It looked like an art institutes promo) 5. Lighting and set design. 6 out of 10. (The environment was solid enough for production) 6. Tempo of the narrative. 0 out of 10 (WHAT) (YEAH) (OK)(Was everyone on adderall?) 7. Acting and costume design. 4 out of 10 (John Boyega amp; Michael Kaplan saved your butts) (Big Deal) 8. Emotional Stimulation. 0 out of 10. (Han dies... yeah that was definitely gonna happen.) (0)(0)(0) - - - 9. Conciseness of Editing. 0 out of 10. (Did fruit ninja cut this movie?) 10. The summation of meeting viewer expectations based on the budget and the hype. -10 out of 10 Total score 15/100 If I could I would direct the whole move again from start to finish. I would just need a time machine. I am deeply saddened that such a legacy was brought to ashes by this film. It is going to take the stuff of legend to summon the phoenix from this burnout production. At least they have the money to get the next one right. Justin Chang says ""its hard not to look favorably upon ""The Force Awakens"" simply for being a massive improvement on ""The Phantom Menace"" ""Attack of the Clones"" and all but a handful of moments in ""Revenge of the Sith"" -- taken together a stultifying experiment in brand extension gone awry in which Lucas much-vaunted technical wizardry and visual imagination proved no match for the unholy torpor of his storytelling."" Aside from pointless pomobabble the only message I get is that ""The Force Awakens"" improved massively on the first three episode films. I argue dramatically that the graceless invisible multistage rocket film ""The Force Awakens"" crumbles at the magnificence of the six prior movies. Chang also says; ""Abrams movie has grit under its nails and blood in its veins as we see in an early battle sequence in which an Imperial Stormtroopers white helmet is suddenly streaked with red."" Number one... stormtrooper helmets are cheesy even if you love Star Wars. And number two... if a little blood in a film implies grit under nails then there is an infinite list of 12 year old directors full of grit. The other films do not show blood like this but that is a good quality. DISNEY?? lets just hide a falice in some cartoons and we will definitely smear blood all over Star Wars. They might as well of handed out toilet paper rolls with the ticket stubs. C. Clark Reply K alexander says March 25 2016 at 708 pm I agree 100%. Its 2015+ for heavens sake. I wont go on and on about how the new movie has technologically (and imaginatively) gone back in time but George Lucas is a genius in regard to expounding on the vast and amazing universe that he created. Ill just leave it at that. Ive watched the first six episodes numerous times not really choosing to do so. There was just so much newness and imagination involved. Thank you George Lucas for expounding as new movie making technologies became available. With the cartoon series I realize that he could go on and on and I wait with baited breath for more new and exciting and innovative. All six movies are entertaining each time I watch. If its in front of me I cant help but watch. With the force awakens once has been more than enough. Not a classic or even an extension of a classic. It was like going back in time technologically as well as creatively. I feel sorry for the young generation that missed the movie making revolutions and this is what they get. I would like to add also that I respect George Lucas for giving us his stories and not being influenced what the public wants. A true artist. Jj abrams grow a pair and create a story something new and innovative. Stop being a politician. Its clear that that is what influenced the creativity in this movie. The muppets you used in the movie were disappointing. The settings equally so. Reply Jen says March 3 2016 at 104 am Great comment and Im absolutly with you. In the past after showing Episode 1 till 3 many people denunciated George Lucas for the prequel. For me George Lucas is a visionary. Back in the end of the 70`s beginning of the 80s he created a wonderful and fascinating universe with Star Wars. Sure the technical effects wasnt so perfect but in that time the story was more than extraordinary and simple at the same time. You have it all; a princess a daredevil a wise old man and a country lad like in a fairy tale. Leap in time to 2005 Third movie ""Revenge of the Sith"" shown in cinemas. After the first two parts of the prequel in which you can follow the story step by step it comes to the final part. Great characters and cast. Great performance from the main cast especially Hayden Christensen who played in my view a remarkable character as Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker too. His embodiment of the villian was outstanding. He combined the light and the dark side in a way I could not imagine. If you saw in his eyes the face and see the facial expression he was absolutly great and phenomenal. The special effects; fights in the Starships the creation of the planets (City planet Coruscant or Mustafar) in the variety of the colours; or better in the way of dark and light the costumes of every single character were really a masterpiece of artwork. The deployment of the character of Anakin Skywalker was gradually. You could see the conflict between the dark and the light side in which the character moved and the reason of all the changing he has live through. Also you have saw a great performance from Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine and how he pulled the strings for his own advantage. And at least the light saber duell between Kenobi and Anakin. Great choreography. Sure some parts/steps of the fight seemed like overdoing but that hasnt derogate the scence in the end. George Lucas has done a GREAT job. Leap in time December 2015. High expectation for the next SW movie; part Vii. The previous doubftful expectation of the fans should be confirmed. Story only a remake from the first triology (part iV till Vi). More than that the story is illogical. In the end of part Vi the empire was beaten all over the Galaxy. And now after 30 years the empire...sorry the ""First Order"" build up a Third Deathstar...sorry the Starkiller base. The movie has shown the difference of the Death Star and the Starkiller Base; its NOT the same. Starkiller base is bigger (and easier to destroy as you can see in the end). The characters and the cast in the end Abrams combined here also three characters from the first triology to only one person girl named Rey nee mechanic nee pilot nee Jedi because she know evertyhing about the force without training. But also shown two sidekicks of the girl; Poe who only are in the movie for the first 10 minutes and than in the end with one little appearance and Finn......the good Storm Tropper after only ONE fight for the Empire....sorry First Order he diecided to be a good one. The bad guy like you said the so named NEW SITHLORD is more a distraughted little child with fit of rage in which he decides to cut down with his great super lightsaber some computer consoles. (Disney-like). And in the end of the movie the evil guy what a great suprise beaten up by the girl Rey who hasnt any experience with light saber technics. What can the fan be expect from the next 2 movies when in the first movie of the triology the hero already beaten the bad guy? In fact not so much because the director J J Abrams will still get functional as executive producer and thank Goodness not as director. But unfortunately Disney and J J Abrams still will be with Star Wars. In the end you can come to the fact that the movie was literarily a failure. No new ideas only the old one in new dresses. The acting performance of Daisy Ridley is wooden. No real emotions are visible. And the sentence in the movie ..."" you will never be like Darth Vader"".... to Kylo Ren was maybe more to herself and the performance/acting of Hayden Christensen. Equilibrate all the main part to a female lead character is overdo. And for what reason? Only to show a female lead character in a SciFi movie. That could not be the reason because in the past this kind of magnificent performance already shown by Sigourney Weaver or in the earlier past Noomi Rapace. Or if you stay in fantasy genre Jennifer Lawrence. These actresses were make a great performance. George Lucas had make a big mistake as he sold the Franchise of Star Wars to Disney because Disney only want to leave ones mark on the products and only think about moneymoneymoney and doesnt take responsibility for the fans. In an interview one year ago or so Kathleen Kennedy Leader of Lucasfilm said that she all will take responsibility for the universe and characters George Lucas invented and will go on with that rootage of the original.....and than in the Part Vii the first thing J J Abrams and Disney were doing is to kill one of the original heros of Star Wars. What a betray to the fans. Most of the people think that cause of the box-office-taking Part Vii was the big hit. But the result would be the same if i.e. the story would be another like some of the fans hoping for new Luke Skywalker Han Solo etc. cast same way what J J Abrams has done with Star Trek back in 2009 which was also a great movie and that the story will go on after the Imperor with the rebuilding of the Jedi Order or if maybe they used the original ideas from George Lucas from the next Triology. And why? Because the fans were so excited because the movie was THE movie after episode Vi after 30 years back in the 80`s. All these things would be better as the level they reached now. Disney and J J Abrams did make a evidence of incapacity with the Star Wars Franchise and movies. And for the unlucky fans they will go on with it. An unimaginative director with no ideas of one`s on and a would-be understanding company. Reply sally94 says February 28 2016 at 312 pm I saw the movie 2-times and at least I can say it was 2-times too much. After I saw the first 6 movies yeah saw the First Episode too ) I can say that Part VII is the worst of them. Yes more than Part I. Reason Like someone already said its nothing new. Abrams got Part iV till Vi put them into a mixer press the start button and than voila Part VII was born. The new heros are so foreseeable. I mean specially the part with Daisy Ridley Rey. I mean I AM a girl but that was exaggerated;her character already knows everything about flying the Falcon Light saber fighting mechanism and machine heads the force....sorry but she could stand without the two other main characters ;Finn and Poe. And than she is frustrated that someone make the compliment that she looks like one of the famous and popular actresses Keira Kneightly? I mean that was her first role as actress in a movie and she are already compared with Keira Kneightly what a Diva. Reply Linda Lorimor says February 27 2016 at 802 pm This movie skimmed over the top. It is an old story which never becomes old-the heros journey. Thousands of times but always compelling. Each of us see ourselves in this journey. I didnt see the characters in this journey so I did not identify. Yep I am an old lady but want to love this but I do not. Reply Steve Eden says February 10 2016 at 644 pm What movie where you watching? Another Death Star? Finn with a lightsaber? By the way his character took away from getting ""lost in the movie"". Rey knowing the intricacies of the Force two hours after hearing the word? There were so many things wrong. I was highly disappointed and too ashamed to let friends and family know. The ultimate let down. The paused scene between Kylo Ren and Han Solo took thirty seconds longer than it should. The audience knew what was going to happen while awaiting the staredown. Im not going to let myself get as hyped up for the next one. Reply Tejas joshi says February 6 2016 at 112 am Class movie I love watching star wars series movies as always. Reply veno says January 18 2016 at 712 am I have to admit that the movie was just a lot of bits and pieces of the old star wars movies and Ive always hated the way older Anakin skywalkers acting was and now the son of han solo is an even worse actor. Why look for Luke at all if he couldnt even train a kid to not be like vader even though vader realized his mistake and became good before he died. How do the girl become so powerful and she just found out she has the force with absolutely no training whatsoever and if she is that powerful she doesnt need Luke apparently shes a natural and somehow I believe shes his daughter. Remember the saber called reached out to her and it always stayed in the family. By the way another death star just bigger? really I can go on and on but its not worth but its just the way they make movies nowadays just awful. Reply Kristian Rojek says January 10 2016 at 548 am I just watched the movie again and it was worse than the first time I saw it. After the first viewing I left the theater extremely disappointed. Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith are both as good if not better and neither of those movies was very good. How does everyone think its so good? I feel like Im taking crazy pills. I am real big Star Wars fan and I was expecting a great movie but JJ Abrams blew it. He and the movie are a joke. A ten year old could have done a better job. Ive read every book and love The Clone Wars and Rebels. This movie not as good as any of them. The story is so unoriginal its ridiculous. If it was just that the movie would still not have been that good but it wasnt. The casting of Rey Finn Poe and Kylo Ren was awful. They are all so bad. Carrie Fisher appears to have no acting ability at all. The dialogue is so rough as well. 1- Reys character is so unbelievable its absurd. She is great at everything right away. She flies the Falcon like a pro the first time she has ever flown a ship off the ground. While dodging fire from a trained tie fighter pilot she is able to position the ship well enough to get the tie fighter in the sites of the jammed gun moments after first flying. Never shot a gun. Who cares? She shoots better than trained stormtroopers on her second shot. The force? Just heard about it but I can learn the skills in one day. When she first meets Kylo Ren he is able to block her blaster shots freeze her read her mind and she faints. A short time later while under duress in a torture chair she is able to block his mind reading ability and then read his mind. She has no idea what powers the force gives her but she is able to use a jedi mind trick to have the 1 and only stormtrooper in site to set her free. On top of all that she is able to defeat Kylo Ren in a light saber battle a day or two later. The guy trained with the jedi killed the other jedi trainees and then has been trained by the sith. I got to assume hes been training for at least 20 years. The guy was able to stop and freeze a blaster shot from Poe without even looking at him but he cant beat someone who just heard about the force? She was also so skilled in the force that she was able to pull the light saber in the snow to her when Kylo Ren was also trying to pull it to him. Luke struggled pulling his light saber out of the snow in Empire and no one was pulling against him and he had been working on his force skills for awhile at that point 2- Finn should have no chance fighting against Kylo Ren but holds his own for a bit and even wounds him with the light saber. The guy could take 20 Finns on at the same time. Did I mention Finn doesnt even have the force and just picked up a light saber the other day. Finn says that he worked in sanitation. Why would he have been on Jakku with the guys who work as soldiers? Shouldnt he be taking the trash out somewhere. Also if he was assigned to sanitation I have to assume he wasnt a very good warrior but watching him in the movie you would think he has the skills of Chuck Norris. 3- The Falcon hasnt flown in years. Why would the ramp be down and the ship not locked? Spring cleaning? Also the ship starts right up and then flies like it did 30 years ago. It makes no sense 4- Finn frees Poe. Poe knows him for 10 minutes and tells him that the map to find Luke Skywalker is in the droid and they are going to get it. Couldnt the guy be a spy? A bit too trusting with a secret everyone seems to be looking for 5- How does Rey understand everything BB8 says? She seems to be fluent in beeps and bops. She even understood the name of the system where the base was located. By the way no one understands wookies and she can understand Chewbacca right away. 6- They take off in the Falcon from Jakku take out a couple of tie fighters and get away with no additional pursuit. There is a star destroyer in orbit over the planet. They cant catch a 50 year old ship that hasnt been used in years? Also Finn and Rey are celebrating in the hallway of the ship while Jakku is still in plain site. Also Finn whispering to BB8 that hes not part of the resistance and to just tell them where the base was is just plain awful dialogue. Such an awful scene. 7- Han and Chewbacca get on the Falcon as leisurely as can be. Wouldnt they come on in combat mode ready to fight the pirates or smugglers who are flying the ship? No worries Im going to check a couple of switches first. 8- The rathars that they are transporting kill everyone in seconds but Finn gets dragged around until rescue can come. Unbelievable 9- One of the smuggler/pirates who survived the rathars calls into the first order to let them know that the droid and two fugitives are on the Falcon with Han Solo. I really believe he would do that out of the goodness of his heart. Of course he wouldnt. He would have wanted to get paid for any information he gave to them. The guy is out 50000 credits that Han stole from him plus he just lost a bunch of guys and weapons. 10- Why is it called the resistance? Wouldnt they just be part of the New Republic military? 11- Why is the awful hologram of Snooke so big? If hes so powerful its kind of pathetic that he needs to portray himself as a giant and if hes giant thats just more stupid 12- 2 of the greatest heroes in the galaxy Luke and Han both decide to give up following Kylo Rens killing of the other jedi trainees and going to the dark side. Wouldnt it have been a better idea to stop him immediately instead of waiting for him to get more powerful? 13- Why would Luke leave such a cryptic message of broken maps to be figured out at an unspecified time? 14- R2D2 is a droid. They should have been able to access the information in him at anytime. They have slicers and techs that could have accessed the information in a short time. If everyone wanted to find Luke so bad why wouldnt they just do that? Instead they decide to just let him sit in the corner full of important information. Come on 15- Another easily destroyed round planet annihilating base. Great idea JJ Moron. How do they shoot a continuous beam from the base all the way to the planets in another system? By the way once in system the beam splits 5 ways to destroy all the planets. Also in order to power the weapon they take energy from the sun and then the sun is destroyed. We see them destroy two suns that both look real close to the base. Is the planet able to fly? Is it in a system with unlimited suns? If you destroyed a sun that close to your planet wouldnt it cause all kinds of problems besides the fact that planet would quickly turn into sold ice with no heat. Great idea using the trench again JJ. 16- Han and Leias scenes together were painful and awkward 17- The needless and stupid scene when the nurse is working on Chewbacca at the base. Thats 20 seconds of my life Ill never get back 18- Kylo Ren senses Han Solo landing on the planet but cant sense that he is 20 feet behind him on the base? 19- Han Solos last scene was not that good. It should have made me feel way more emotion than it did. Fair at best 20- Captain Phasma was a worthless character. She is the head of the stormtroopers and suppose to be a badass but she lowers the shield on the base without any fight leading to the destruction of a good portion of the first order. The trash compactor jokes were also awful 21- How does the resistance know how long it takes for the Starkiller base to charge? They saw it in action once and werent ready for it. I cant imagine they have much intel at this point but they know exactly how much time they have left before it charges. The mention the time remaining 3 times. 22- The planet splitting between Rey and Kylo is just lazy 23- How do they find Kylo in the middle of the woods before the planet blows up and for that matter how does Chewbacca find Rey and Finn in the middle of the woods? 24- Leia has known Chewbacca for more than 30 years. He gave her a big hug when they first see her again. He has a life debt to Han and is his best friend. Han dies. They return to the base. Chewbacca walks right by Leia. She doesnt even look at him. Instead she is staring at Rey and gives her a hug. This is a girl she just met the other day and someone who knew Han for a week. 25- R2 finally wakes up and they decide its a great idea to put the map up in a room full of hundreds of people. Dont worry the first order couldnt possible have had a spy infiltrate the resistance. 26- They decide to send Rey and Chewbacca to find Luke in a 50 year old ship that has not been repaired from smashing through the woods and into the planet and probably barely worked on at all for at least the last bunch of years. Oh yeah Rey and Chewbacca are brand new to the resistance. Wouldnt they send a bunch of ships or better ships to look for him? Also the map seemed to be a map of star systems not a map of the planet. It could have taken them years to find the right island or continent he was on. Lucky for them they found him on the first island they checked. If I would have reviewed the script prior to shooting i would have made all the same notes and the script would have been fixed before shooting. Did they just write it and never read it again? If this wasnt Star Wars everyone would think its horrible. Reply Rob McKain says January 23 2016 at 1200 pm Well and concisely said youve taken the words out of my mouth. While watching the film I couldnt help but be pulled out of the story when each of the plot hole points you listed occurred. I know Abrams has taken Spielbergs throne as the current hot blockbuster director but I really think he and the other writers got lazy and sloppy. I still generally enjoyed the film but as with Lucas prequel trilogy I wont pay to see it again and I seriously doubt that Ill add it to my movie library as though it stirred up some nostalgia for me I feel it was a big missed opportunity to truly thrill Star Wars fans with a new well written storyline. Reply Mag70 says January 25 2016 at 1058 am I think this movie was meant to be directed much like a magicians stage act alot slight of hand and misdirection. If you do not think or are under 15 yrs old the movie works. Like most big budget films these days flash over substance or coherence. A rice cake world that equals ...apparently the true litmus test for a good movie now a days. Books are better imagination thrillers. Liston Pennington says January 13 2016 at 627 am finally someone whose head is not stuck up disneys ass. THE FARCE RETURNS is a big disappointment to ant fan who knows the Star Wars galaxy through the first six movies and a total failure to those us who have read the many books that make up the fabric of space that the Stars Wars galaxy occupies. Never mind that everything that happens in the books that follow Return of the Jedi such as Lukes childrenHans and Leias multiple children other great charters and new tech. The movie is just bad it is just little snips of what hopefully is a better story pasted to gather to make one long spoiler commercial of a movie never made. As long as disney is making STAR WARS movies if I see them it will be on a borrowed video. Reply SK says January 10 2016 at 255 am Watched the movie last night and I loved it Ive watched all the episodes and I really appreciated the film. I guess its important to have watched the previous episodes to really know whats going on. Well done to all the actors. They were all great. Reply Sandra says January 7 2016 at 410 am I just saw the movie and Im a big Star Wars fan I have to say this was one of the worse I have seen it was all rehashed from the previous Star Wars movie what a joke the only difference is that they put in new characters. I totally agree with George Lucas and what he said about Disney they are destroying the franchise any bets that the next one is going to be rehashed as well? Reply Laughing-Williamson Lynnie says January 6 2016 at 920 pm I thoroughly enjoyed the original series of Star Wars. Force Awakens was nothing more than another spoof/parody. Perhaps if Abrams presented this as a parody...I would have enjoyed it more. The humor was stupid and inappropriately applied. I couldnt take the movie seriously at all. There was no continuity from the last movie to this one. Examples Kylo Ren was nothing more than a child with a slightly out of control temper that no one feared. I didnt see Princess Leia. I saw a recovered drug addict playing the princess. disappointing neednewdentures Abrams excellent job NOT REALLY. Reply UrbanHillbilly says January 6 2016 at 503 am I loved Star Wars back in 1977 and grew weary of it as the later films looked more and more like feature length toy commercials. I cant saddle this Disney production with that particular criticism. This film is much worse. It is a complete waste of time. JarJar Abrams did exactly what he did with the Star Trek films He took pieces of the plots of the earlier films and strung them together in a rather forced manner only connecting necessary characters by coincidence. The plot is a mess. It wasnt visually interesting and the sound track was utterly worthless. By going back and rehashing old plots Abrams has doomed the franchise to complete stagnation. When I said ""The plot is a mess"" I really understated it. Reply Simon Barradell says January 6 2016 at 1221 am Simon 6/1/16 UK - I totally agree with what Frank has said on 5/1/16. I watched the film last night after watching all the first 6 films in order again. This film is garbage and has destroyed the Star Wars franchise it made no sense I wish I had not wasted my money. Yes I agree that George Lucass prequels the cgi was not good and it was good to see less of that in the new film but please where is the story and morals of what Star Wars is all about... Terrible JJ Abrahams admits the story is crap thats an under statement. Others that havent seen it do not watch let the magic of the first 6 along with top acting stay in your memory dont shatter it.. Reply Frank says January 5 2016 at 539 pm I thought Star Wars - The Force Awakens was terrible. They ruined the star wars franchise. Actors and acting was just atrocious. Story and plot was boring and not believable at all. I really dont like how it took Luke Skywalker three movies (including training by Yoda) before he could use/handle the force and defeat Darth Vader but it takes this girl 14 seconds (with no training) to figure out and master all the nuances of the force and defeat the dark side/Kylo Ren. She went from scavenger/nobody to the ultimate jedi warrior in 14 seconds with no training. Just ridiculous and stupid. She is not believable as a hero/jedi saving the galaxy and Kylo Ren is not believable as the bad guy (new Darth Vader) - hes a wuss. Im surprised they did not have him break down and cry and surrender to the girl. Terrible job as a villain. I wont bother going to see any more Star Wars movies now that Disney is doing them. Reply Adam says January 4 2016 at 1127 pm Im a fan of Star Wars in many of its incarnations somewhere between hardcore and casual. I thought TFA was a good roller coaster but not a good movie. I havent read any of the books and couldnt care less about Disney not using any of the expanded material. My issues with the film were its lack of detail and disregard for the audiences intelligence. The movie breaks its own established rules which is bad storytelling 101. Mainly it treads on the rules established by the originals. You could make the argument that TFA is making its own new rules so it supersedes the old ones. I would whole heartedly agree with that if it werent for the fact that TFA is not being treated as a new take (read reboot) but rather as an extension on an existing universe. The same characters tone and aesthetic have been gloriously revamped. Its a perfect recreation of what Lucas did 40 years ago. In a purely superficial way. And thats the problem. All the connective tissue is completely gone. Theres so little care to making sense of the circumstances of the film. The republic is the reigning force in the galaxy so why are they called the resistance? How does Starkiller move between suns? Kylo Rens force powers inconsistency. Rey figuring out the mind control trick with no training. The multiple deus-ex-machinas. The plot holes have been documented expertly elsewhere so I wont go in to them any more here. Besides being lazy storytelling many of the plot holes simply couldnt happen in the bounds of what the original trilogy set forth. TFA should have made much more effort to work within the existing creative limitations. That would have payed true homage to the originals. I wouldve been much happier with TFA had it created an extended world on top of what already exists rather than ham-handedly juggling the old and the new and not quite doing full justice to either. All that complaining aside I did enjoy TFA for its spectacle. I dont consider JJ Abrams a good storyteller but he knows how to make a fun-to-watch movie. Hes a great image maker. My problem is all those little inconsistencies and logic jumps pull me out of my suspension of disbelief. I think the frustrating part to a lot of dismayed fans is that the general public seems to be giving TFA much more leeway in being a severely flawed movie than other films of its ilk. It almost feels like people watched it with ""rose colored glasses"" just because Star Wars is such a cultural juggernaut. Reply LanaLorenzen says January 4 2016 at 518 am Agree. Just saw Star Wars The Force Awakens. People complained about Carrie Fishers appearance? Really?? That movie was so full of plot holes bad writing and embarrassing acting that Fishers aging should be the last thing people notice I dont know where that 200 million budget went but it certainly didnt go into writing editing and casting. First The Good. Ive never seen better special effects in 40 years of movies and Domhnall Gleeson is superb as the General. Chewbacca C-3PO R2-D2 and BB-8 are amazingly good in their roles-and about the best things in the movie. The Bad. The British actors speak as if they all graduated from Cambridge and took a short break from the Royal Shakespeare Theatre to do the movie (except for the painful brogue of the Scotsman? Irishman? who threatens Han. Everytime Daisey Ridley spoke I thought I was listening to Keira Knightly-Actually Knightly would have been an amazing Rey in contrast to the cardboard cutout Ridley. John Boyega was awful as Finn the actor has zero charisma zero charm or no discernable intelligence. Ditto for Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron. Neither Boyega or Daisey Ridley have the star power to ignite a romantic spark with a torch. And speaking of torches the Storm Troopers use flamethrowers in the age of Light Sabers and travel at the speed of light? Adam Driver was semi-competent. The movie was so short he along with the other characters never had time to develop. The Ugly. The dialogue was flat humorless and in some places anachronistic (Boyegas character actually uses the word ""bro""). The acting and dialogue were just so subpar even I could have a done better job of casting and writing. And last but not least Why wasnt the film just made by a British production company? It might as well have been. In short this film has Disney written all over it-and not in a good way. Reply J.Isermann says January 3 2016 at 423 pm Disney should apologize Best review here. Full of unacceptable logical mistakes a poor boring copy of what have been done 30 years ago. Up to the band in a bar playing same music style? Emotionless uninspired. It never touched me. If you want to eat 30 year old food slightly warmed up...I can tell you""Its not tasty"" They turned diamonds into stones.

The Force Awakens is inspired and Daisy Ridley is a magnificent find Reply Michelle Harte says December 29 2015 at 902 am It was not about what the war was about. Disney focused on feelings which was totally weeny like. Miss the old Star Wars. Very disappointed and will not go out of my way to see the next. What will they do in that one have both sides hug and become friends? Disney no one wants to see politically correct in Star Wars you are ruining the franchise Reply Burstibeard says December 28 2015 at 1016 pm I dont think Abrams did us justice. The writing was uninspiring and parallel ep4 far to closely. The dialogue felt less stilted and more natural though (which was one of my complaints with the prequels) and there were no wok/Jar Jar moments (yeah). I liked the new players. Rae was a bit naive given her life but I could see that as a possible psychology for her. Finn seemed confused as much as scared which makes sense given that he is fighting 15+ years of brain washing. I liked them both but given their handling in the movie I didnt become emotionally invested in the characters until the very end (in case your wondering Mr. Abrams - thats not good). There didnt seem to be a romantic interest between the two of them which to be honest is good. There was a growing deep friendship developing which I applaud. This will mean that if love blooms it will be from something besides the hormones of the moment. If it doesnt bloom then thats alright as well. I dont think that element is always necessary or the right thing for each story. All the problems with the Anakin character (ep2 amp;3) as the annoying whiny brat were magnified 10 fold in the character of Kylo Ren. Vader was a good screen villain Maul was a good screen villain and Dooku was a good screen villain. Kylo Ren was just pathetic and annoying. And the scene between him and Han was so cliche and predictable. I dont know anyone that didnt see it coming at least 10 min before it did. Why another dooms day weapon. Were the creative juices of the writing team just not flowing. Oh I can hear the discussion now. Lets take the Death Star (the size of a small moon) and make it a planet capable of firing through hyperspace with a mirv payload. Wow that would take a lot of energy. So well say they need to drain a star every time it needs to be fired. Wont that make it very dark on that planet (trees dont grow with no star)? Sure but no one will notice that we already fired the weapon once (having already drained our star to do it) so they wont question that we need to wipe out the star a second time. The cheese factor on this alone went to 11. The Maz character was a highlight for me. The sad part is that I cared more about her in her first 10 seconds of screen time that about the main characters in their first hour. I could go on about what I did or didnt like about the movie. It wasnt a total write off. I give a solid C+ (7.5). Part of the problem when you over hype a movie is that it raises expectations. Expectations were already high for TFA (perhaps unreasonably so). I had mixed feelings when Disney acquired SW but given that I liked what they did with the Marvel franchise I was hopeful. Now Im no longer certain that was prudent (especially given how theyve handled the franchise regarding the expanded universe - Darth Disney anyone). Even as disappointed as I was I will see the next installment hoping for better things to come. FYI - I was 9 when A New Hope came out in 1977. I remember standing in lines around the block in downtown Seattle. Together with various family members I watched it 39 times that year. Ive only read a few of the novels and read a few of the comics. Ive seen all of The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebals eps. Im a fan (but not a rabid one). Im not willing to accept mediocre work and pretend its gold. Reply rod says December 28 2015 at 739 pm Not surprising since Star Wars is now part of the McDonalds of entertainment family (Disney) over-hyped and with no substance. The franchise should have packed it all in 5 episodes ago. Reply jim says December 28 2015 at 512 pm i was very disappointed. the movie was just a repeat of the first movie with different characters. it was all most boring. Reply charlie says January 4 2016 at 144 pm I agree charlie Reply Timothy Douglas Moyer says December 27 2015 at 845 pm I see positive reviews for this but it is by far the worst Star Wars movie in my opinion. Phoning it in and remaking IV just because you cant come up with a single original idea between your entire creative team isnt the way to continue the Star Wars franchise. The Canon Disney threw out is filled with story lines from a vast number of different writers. If Disney couldnt find someone to come up with something for this movie it is simply because they dont care and know they can skate by with no effort and make money because of the Star Wars title. Reply Jeff Linnane says December 27 2015 at 1004 am I am SHOCKED this movie has received this much hype Very mediocre from start to finish What surprised me the most is the lack of a new direction for these movies. I mean its the same crap formulaic Hollywood BS We are really supposed to believe Rhea learns the ""force"" all by herself? Ugh. Reply Chris R says December 26 2015 at 1109 pm Please save your money. Its more or less a remake of the 1st star wars. They had a death star WE GOT A BIGGER ONE. Their R2 rolled on legs OURS IS A BALL. Obi Won dies in the 1st HANS DIES NOW. And that absolute worst is the casting for Darth 2 He takes off the helmet and there is no reason other than ""I wanna be like Granddad. He doesnt even look menacing. The effects are better but its star wars 2.0. I only wish you could sue to get your money back but its my fault when I seen JJ his only contribution was a ball R2. ""we got toys to sell"". apparently the universe is controlled by 1 or 2 families. We had the villain dad and the 2 kids heroes now their kids are the villains?? How original. I also think it was sad that the old cast was so OLD they had nothing for them to do without worrying about them breaking a hip. And that ending 20 minutes for the girl to hand off a lightsabor What?. Then when you think about it each person trains the evil jedi then steps back and lets them go. What? Reply Elan Holdorf says December 26 2015 at 833 pm Excellent review aside from one gripe. You say matter of factly that Force Awakens is an improvement on Phantom Menace. I would say rather that all three Lucas Prequels are interesting films remarkable enjoyable and finely made in some ways. Force Awakens is a more classically made Hollywood movie equally as well crafted in different ways than Phantom Menace. Please do not regard your opinions about the Lucas Prequels as fact when there are fans of each director. Otherwise very nicely said. Reply Jens says December 26 2015 at 853 am I grew up with the Star Wars movies (Original part 4 till 6) and than the Prequel ten years ago. George Lucas created a fantastic extraordinary universe and a great SciFi Saga. I loved it. And I already know that JJ Abrams and Disney would destroy that great universe. After I saw the movie I got assurance. JJ Abrams destroyed the magic world of Star Wars. After so many people convicted George Lucas for makingthe prequel of the Original Trilogy ( I dont count to this one) I can say more than any worse as Part VII it WILL be come with the next 2 movies. The movies was unimaginative no fantasy lacked vision. An evidence of incapacity from JJ Abrams. Reply Sanity Unrequited says January 2 2016 at 1235 pm I agree with every word. I adore the Prequel Trilogy as well. Lucas set out to both continue telling his story while also crafting films that were completely different than the OT. The world building he accomplishes in the Prequels is astonishing. And I love the style feel characters amp; pacing of the Prequels. From discovery amp; inceptive Star Wars battles to procedural mystery leading into an all out war and finishing with the carefully planned amp; executed abolishment of The Republic amp; Rise of The Empire. I am as big a fan of The Prequels as I am of the OT. And when you factor in SW; The Clone Wars amp; Rebels animated shows my preference leans towards the world created by The Prequels. Still for all its derivative elements and far more typical Hollywood feel tone amp; style I do love The Force Awakens. I also hold out hope that the next installments wont have us revisiting any other Star Wars film seen in this Galaxy very close to home instead offering us something new amp; never before seen or been to while telling us a new Star Wars tale that flies into unexplored exciting territory. Reply Jeff says December 26 2015 at 547 am A lot of people did not like the prequels George Lucas did but for me they were great story telling adventures. This new instalment of Star wars the Force awakens is a far cry from the Story telling and direction of George Lucas. Abrams has ruined the Star Wars franchise for me. If he Comes back and does episode 8 I will not go see the picture. If Disney continue to make movies like this The Star Wars Universe will collapse on it self. Reply Disneypideperdon says December 25 2015 at 414 pm JJA? No it is a ZAZ parody of original film. One hundred chimps could make a better script for this nonsense. The fact is Disneys force is too much stronger than critics light sold to Disney Corp. One of the worst films Ive ever seen Reply bobbyvalentine says December 24 2015 at 638 pm I grew up on the original trilogy (to young to have seen SW in the theater but Empire amp; Return on opening day). My children saw the prequels and simply love them. Some of us original fans react to the prequels like Red Forman did to Vader himself. There some is NO bad Star Wars film. Some not as great as the others but not one is bad. That said my family waited for 2 yrs for this movie then hours in line. To say we were excited is an understatement. When the movie was over dad and teenage daughters debated the movie till 3 am. The best it got was a 7 out of 10 rating. There were incredibly exciting moments. Finn and Rey both were stellar. Seeing Han and Chewie awesome. But ... For being set 30 years in the future we were all incredibly disappointed that the movie was a literal rip off of A New Hope. To quote my 20 yr old daughter who is every bit a SW geek ""there was not an original idea in the movie"" Mirroring is ok and good narrative technique. Abrams is not mirroring it is simply a ""reboot."" Better than Fantastic Four reboot fo shizzle but still a shameless reboot. To quote my 17 year old daughter ""Kylo is the worst Sith in the universe."" I liked the movie. For those who like the above reviewer claiming it is magnitudes better than the prequels will have to argue with my teens. The good stuff in this movie is there not because of Abrams rather it is there because he ripped off George Lucas. Just the opinion of a family of four who will see this again Christmas day and buy it on Blu-ray -) Reply Alex says December 24 2015 at 117 pm STAR WARS The Force Awakens Please note this review was written by a rank amateur who has never written a film review before. I was and avid admirer of the original film when it was released many decades ago and had high hopes for this new release. But after seeing the 2D version a few days ago and taking a while to digest the new spectacle my overall feelings of disappointment and having being let down upon leaving the theater have not subsided. A more apt subtitle for the film would have been ""Dark Force DejaVu"". This ""new version"" of the original scifi thriller has not expanded on any of the new and interesting technological ideas and concepts brought to life in the original version. The sleek levitating vehicle in the original film is now forty years later depicted as looking like the front end of a 1930s Farmall tractor minus the wheels. The local bar room scene from the original film is again shown populated with different outlandish looking creatures typical of many copycat scenes throughout the film. The plot still revolves around the struggle between the Dark Side evil force and the Good Side force. As in the original film a member of a heroic family again has been corrupted and goes over to the Dark Side. Nothing new here so far and the plot stays that way for the rest of the film. Even after forty years of supposed technological advancement the rebel Star Fighter aircraft appear virtually the same (X-shaped) and the evil force fighters still look like two waffles held together by a toothpick (H-shaped). The original Death Star is now a orb equipped with some sort of a force cannon powered not by the old plasma energy technology but by a nearby sun. Same old plot The new ""Darth Vader"" character and his evil master seek to destroy all the rebel Forces of the Good Side by blowing all their planetary strongholds. Fighters in both films on both sides still use phasers and lasers to annihilate each other the bad guys are still are dressed in the same old uniforms and the final battle between good and bad family members is again waged using laser sabers - apparently weapons development during the four-decade period in between was zilch along with any interesting plot updates. As in the old version rebel forces are again required to fly through a dangerously narrow channel to attack a vulnerable spot on the new ""Death Star"" and to no ones surprise they succeed. By now I think you get my point - virtually no new scifi technology and very little in the way of a new plot twists. Perhaps the saddest of all we have to endure the aging images of our original heroes in their waning years with virtually frozen faces unable to provide little to the illusion of vitality and action of a mediocre film. In short this new film is more of a remake of the original film than the hoped-for sequel depicting forty years of scifi technological ""advances"" and interesting plot-line innovations. Hollywood has failed to deliver what could easily have been a major advance in scifi drama and technological filmmaking through a lack of imagination and poor script craftsmanship. If the new generation of Star Wars fans accepts this poorly done sequel as a substitute for the real capabilities and creativeness of modern filmmakers then the best days of creative filmmaking are behind us and merchandising profits will have become the new benchmark of filmdoms success. Reply Albert Speer says December 22 2015 at 1046 pm Star Wars The Force Recycled. This movie makes me wish humanity would come to an end. Die screaming. Reply Mace says December 22 2015 at 110 pm You naysayers are too funny. I wasnt looking for a heavy duty plot or in depth character development. I was looking for an entertaining addition to the saga that ties in old characters and I got that and loved it Would see it again and again. Reply chogyam says January 8 2016 at 1254 am Thankyou....finally someone with some brains. It was a Star Wars film. A very well done bridge between the old and the current towards the 2 films to come in the trilogy. And way over a billion in tickets...thats a lot of people in the audience for a ""worst Star Wars movie of all time."" People are so critical on the web. Reply Jeremy says December 22 2015 at 1114 am SPOILER ALERT Easily the worst Star Wars movie of all time. This coming from a die-hard fan. Obviously the dumb ass director has never read any of the Star Wars books written with Lucas Arts on the cover. Nothing is right first of all Lukes son is Ben not Han. Next your trying to tell me a storm trooper could actually fight a Sith and score a hit on ""Darth Tantrum""...come on... And finally you couldnt come up with an original plot I mean really this was A New Hope with a change of gender roles. Movie was a fail...Disney needs to apologize to all Star Wars fans and George Lucas. Reply Sandra says January 7 2016 at 433 am Thats why George Lucas did not like the movie because he knew it was a rip off of his work. Reply James W Barber says December 21 2015 at 408 pm Hmm. The negative comments here are from idiots who DO NOT love the original Star Wars Films. Or from Crybaby Morons who having read all the expanded universe books (theres like 40 of them. Get a life already) are whining because they didnt use those story lines. There are several GOOD reasons why the Expanded Universe stories will never be made It is impossible for you to love or appreciate anything new. TFA was already ruined for you before you ever even saw TFA because your expectations were too high. Whatever appealed to you originally about Star Wars is dead and your negative attitudes and snark are what killed it. I feel sorry for you. Give it a break already. Did nothing in this movie please you? If you say no you are lying to yourself and cheating everyone here. Quit wasting our time JJ created a DAMN good movie (though flawed in places but the Originals were flawed too) and brought back the magic of Star Wars...something even George Lucas could never do. The Force Awakens is EVERYTHING I hoped The Phantom Menace would be...and more. Much much more. For those of us kids who skipped school back in 1983 to see Jedi. For those of us who took our kids to Episodes 1-3 (15 years ago) with great hopes only to suffer Jar-Jar Binks and Hadyn Christiansen. This is a dream come true that took 32 years in the making. Our New Hope. I was very happy be alive to see this and shed several tears of joy that Star Wars is BACK And I finally got to finally see a REAL Star Wars movie with my sons. Simply put. If you love the Original Star Wars Films you will love this movie Reply Scott Kendall says December 22 2015 at 201 pm Apparently you have never watched any of the movies which are canon not the books. Reply Dean W (dnealwinchester) says December 22 2015 at 923 am I am a die hard fan of the original trilogy and by that I mean the ORIGINAL theatrical releases not the George Lucas mutilated re-releases. However that being said the newest movie sucked worse than the prequels. As you know Harrison Ford originally hated his Han Solo character and wanted him killed off but at least gave into the option of coming back with RotJ. I have a feeling Harrison hated what had become of the beloved franchise so much that he demanded Han be killed in Force Awakens and wanted nothing more to do with it I can also see why Mark Hamill initially wanted nothing to do with this newest installment Force Awakens is by far the worst movie Ive ever seen and will never hold a candle to Empire. Reply James W Barber says December 22 2015 at 953 am Dean. How about some truth? Where did you get your information regarding Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill? All of the originals were VERY excited to come back. They were all given a choice and NONE backed out. In fact Mark and Carrie lost tons of weight each. That takes much commitment (and cash) and I highly doubt Harrison Ford hated Star Wars. He hated it so much that he made another movie. I really doubt that. Let go of your hate. And again if you are so disappointed no one is twisting your arm to continue watching. TFA has created so many new young fans we really dont need you. Go watch something else. Were better off without your snark and negative attitudes anyway. TFA isnt perfect I agree. But neither were the Originals and thats what makes them so much fun Perry says December 21 2015 at 432 pm Brilliant post James. I just dont get those that are being critical Im sure they would have been so however it was made. Some people love to critise something to just sound intellectual it feels like.. TFA is everything I personally could of dreamed of after the disappointment of the prequals. Star Wars truly is back and now my kids can feel like I felt in 1977 thank you JJ. Reply Jim Andersen says February 2 2016 at 1108 pm I dont understand all the hate here. This is Star Wars . It sounds like all these critics were expecting The Shawshank Redemption or something. I get the feeling all these haters are just a sorry group of grown ups who forgot how to just have fun without drugs sex alcohol drama and continue to think they know everything. I see that B.S. a lot on these comment sites. Great movie. No its not like when I saw the original in 1977(?) but neither is Avatar Jurrasic or any other film since then. Star Wars was like the Beatles Elvis or Hiroshima and may never be duplicated. James W Barber says December 22 2015 at 942 am Thank you. Both of my sons 17 and 19 now. THEY LOVE THIS MOVIE They are experiencing the same ecstasy I felt at the same age with the Originals 30 years ago. This didnt happen with the prequels they sucked and both my boys (10 years ago) agreed. Let the naysayers complain all they want. Star Wars is back and in a big way. If they would just open their very closed minds and let in some of magic they would feel the same. But they are so full of the dark side they cannot let in the light. Too bad really. The great part is that their whining doesnt really matter this time. The world loves this movie and well do just fine without them. Yuuzhan Vong says December 21 2015 at 749 am I have to say that I was really disappointed with the film. The only thing missing from what was basically the plot from the Return of the Jedi move was the Ewoks. For me personally I wish they would have taken a plot from the New Jedi Order book series; where were introduced to a new enemy from outside the galaxy the Yuuzhan Vong with their organic ships and their strange views towards technology. Had they done that it would have been so much better then the rehash of the 4 5 amp; 6 story lines. Reply yawn says December 20 2015 at 1040 pm The Farce Awakens and put me to sleep - literally. Everything was so recycled that it was just silly. ""New hairdo? Same coat?"" You gotta be kidding me. The writing was just stupid. An orphan in the desert finds a droid with a secret message??? Are you kidding me??? A weapon the size of a planet that can destroy planets?? Im starting to think some of you reviewers are just so saturated with bad movies that you cant tell good from bad anymore. Get a life. This movie gets an F. Reply Dean W (dnealwinchester) says December 22 2015 at 926 am Brilliantly said Jar Jar Abrams destroyed this beloved franchise far much worse than he did Star Trek. Reply Greggreen29 says December 30 2015 at 744 pm Lucas destroyed his own franchise with the Prequel trilogies. His priorities seemed to be first marketing action figures to children hence Jar Jar Binks and non-acting Anakin; second to have a bunch of spectacular CGI; third to have a nice place indoors with a comfy chair that he didnt have to get out of when directing actors in front of the green screen. Finally maybe a script that might tie all this stuff together to make sense but if got to be too much work just skip the make sense part. He destroyed The Force as a spiritual force and made it mere biology. He destroyed the idea of Yoda as a cerebral monk and made him a hyper jumping light saber swinging critter. Have you seen the behind the scenes shots where Lucas jokes that since the sets are built hed better write the script? Or where he tells someone that if he (Lucas) forgets to say action or cut please someone say it for him? Can someone be more disinterested in making a movie than that? His writing for the prequels was terrible and his directing was as bad just basic over the shoulder shots for talking actors. No imagination or ingenuity or subtleties. CGI camera angles were imaginative but that may be credit to the CGI guys and not Lucas. In the original movies set creativity (and difficulties) and imaginative camera angles were demonstrated even in the movie he directed. Being on real sets allowed for more involved acting and better directing (camera shots) because the director knew what the set looked like since it wasnt all green screen. Dynnik says December 26 2015 at 1002 pm I agree with you Dean (and in your previous comments). --But maybe Jar Jar Abrams did fck up Star Trek even worse. (?) Anyway no place in space for the dunce. -( Omarion says December 20 2015 at 945 pm I loved the movie but the only bad part was that Finn and tea could be Jedi together I would love that if you make a new movie old and thank you Reply Derek says December 20 2015 at 1041 pm What the heck are you talking about? Reply Mark says December 20 2015 at 736 pm The plot was so weakthe screenplay horribly recycled. How does this movie get 98% on a rotten tomatoes? Reply Dean W (dnealwinchester) says December 22 2015 at 928 am Disney probably paid them off. Reply Derek says December 20 2015 at 853 pm Agree - terrible Reply Ted A. DeMaio says December 21 2015 at 1108 am Mark couldnt agree with you more The Force Awakens is probably the worst Star Was ever made no I correct that is the worst Star Wars ever made The characters Rey Finn and Dameron Poe were so weak these characters(actors) didnt do nothing for me. I cant believe that fans and other critics dont see the rip offs of the original Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back down with the droid holding information on Luke Skywalkers where abouts(The first Star Wars with R2D2 holding information for Obi Wans location) and the lousy villian Kyle Rens secret(Holy Cow Luke I am your father Empire Stikes Back rip off). Lets talk about Kyl a Darth Vader wannabe? Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher looked miserable in this whole film. I did not like what they did with this characters not going to give a spolier away just too depressing.

TWITTER 12/18/2015 The J.J. Abrams-directed Episode VII stars Daisy Ridley John Boyega Oscar Isaac and returning castmembers Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. [Warning This review contains plot details from the film that could be considered spoilers.] The Force is back. Big time. As the best Star Wars anything -- film TV show video game spinoff what-have-you -- in at least 32 years Star Wars The Force Awakens pumps new energy and life into a hallowed franchise in a way that both resurrects old pleasures and points in promising new directions. But whereas the fundamental touchstones of George Lucas original creation remain in director J.J. Abrams hands there is a shift in tone that brings the material closer to the feel of a Steven Spielberg film. Specifically into an Indiana Jones realm which is mostly but not entirely to the good. Opening nearly everywhere in the world before Christmas with China to follow in early January Disneys debut as the new custodian of Lucas baby looks to deliver nothing less than one of the two or three highest-grossing films of all time. To be sure any time you can speak of a films earning potential as residing in the billion-dollar-plus neighborhood the main story is to be more often found in the business section than on the arts pages. When the financial stakes are this high what ends up on the screen can often be judged as much or more in terms of commercial calculation than creative achievement. So one of the primary satisfactions of this sharply paced and lively blockbuster is the obvious care that has gone into every aspect of the production from the well-balanced screenplay and dominance of real sets and models over computer graphics to the casting a strict limitation on self-referential in-jokey humor and the thoroughly refreshed feel of John Williams exuberant score. Virtually none of these virtues were managed by Lucas himself when he made his lamentable second trilogy of Star Wars films from 1999 to 2005. But Abrams has made his career thus far by honoring his masters notably Spielberg and Gene Roddenberry and now Lucas and hes got the practice more or less down. Read more THRs 1977 Review of Star Wars The Empire looked all but dead and buried by the time its defeat was celebrated by the heroes of the Rebel Alliance (along with a bunch of funny looking woodsy characters) in Return of the Jedi in 1983. If the desire was to follow up on that story with some of the same characters and actors the first priorities for the writers were to figure out how to use the three-decades-older Han Solo Leia and Luke Skywalker as well as to resurrect a plausible villainous force. In this one notably feels the hand of Lawrence Kasdan who shares writing credit with Abrams and Michael Arndt but who also significantly co-wrote The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and perhaps more significantly authored Raiders of the Lost Ark the film this new one most resembles in terms of its incident and exuberance. What perhaps goes missing in The Force Awakens though is the key magical element that Lucas slipped into the first three films that of the Joseph Campbell-derived aspects of myth that may have been the secret ingredient that allowed them to connect so strongly with viewers initially. Star Wars Episode VII must and does begin with the familiar Williams musical fanfare and an informational scroll advising as to the disappearance of Luke Skywalker the rise of the evil First Order and the threat now posed to Leia and the galaxys good folk who must urgently pull together as a new Resistance. In an annihilating nocturnal opening sequence a new generation of Stormtroopers goes on an indiscriminate rampage while searching for the bearer of a map revealing Lukes whereabouts which is secretly held by the roly-poly BB-8 a charming spherical droid that rolls smoothly from place to place and overall serves as a welcome robot reboot from the sidelined (but hardly vanquished) R2-D2. Read more Lucasfilms Kathleen Kennedy on What George Lucas Thinks of Force Awakens Plans for Indiana Jones Battle lines are drawn and good guys and bad are readily established. Hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac very enthusiastic) a man very much in the Solo mold is taken prisoner by the Order which is led militarily by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a man whose black mask and filtered speech make him the very picture of a Darth Vader wannabe. Meanwhile a Stormtrooper who comes to be called Finn (John Boyega) is so disgusted by the genocide in which hes participated that he defects to the Resistance. Crucially Finn forms an alliance with desert ""scavenger"" Rey (Daisy Ridley) a self-sufficient loner with fearsome fighting and survival skills. Reys feisty individualism assertive physicality and often sweaty dirty face would make her right at home in a Mad Max film just one example of how the Star Wars franchise has been toughened up a bit by its new proprietors. After spending most of the first half-hour introducing the two appealing new leads Abrams and his co-writers begin deftly weaving together elements old and new. Harrison Fords first appearance sends a real charge through the film of a sort that only a revered older star can deliver. A younger character asks if hes really Han Solo and when Ford replies ""I used to be"" he sounds a great deal like John Wayne did in his later films where he was paired with greenhorns who presumed they might be able to go toe-to-toe with the old man and maybe even step into his shoes. Fat chance of that the older man would imply with a caustic glance or acerbic line -- and Ford has now aged (much better than Wayne did) into that position of confident superiority; he can still throw off the impatient action-seeking Solo vibe and isnt interested in acting old or particularly mature just capable. Read more After The Force Awakens Where Does Star Wars Go Next? (Spoilers) With Luke vanished and Leia grounded Han Solo now has only Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew returning) by his side so he welcomes getting back into action with the likes of the capable Rey and Finn. If a good part of the task The Force Awakens sets for itself is the introduction and establishment of these two new characters as capable of carrying the renewed series forward then its pretty well succeeded; never once appearing to ask for sympathy or even to be liked Ridley looks like shes ever-ready to take on a contingent of Hunger Games opponents while Boyega perhaps overplaying at first settles in as his character transforms from robotic foot soldier to expressive and emotive man. A looming unanswered question here is how the Dark Side seemingly so thoroughly vanquished not very long ago could have staged such a rapid and stupendous comeback Just as Lucas once did Abrams uses the template of Hitlers 1934 Nuremberg rally in his staging of an enormous gathering of the First Orders forces. At the risk of indulging in partial spoilers its Supreme Leader Snoke is a larger-than-life vaguely Harry Potter-ish hologram voiced with deep gravity by Andy Serkis; the full weight of this characters malignancy and dramatic power will presumably be better assessed in subsequent episodes. On the other hand Darth Vader stand-in Ren is given a pronounced inferiority complex a clever bad guy twist that could be taken to interesting places both in the writing and performance. One of the most novel and appealing characters is a leathery goggles-wearing old barfly named Maz Kanata (wonderfully voiced by Lupita Nyongo) who with her wise and direct talk comes closest to approximating a new Yoda; once again there is considerable potential in this figure. On the other hand an old pleasure is renewed with the brief appearance of a refurbished C-3PO once again voiced by Anthony Daniels. Read more How Star Wars Will Change Hollywood (Again) As before monumental battles enacted by enormous obliteration-capable forces are paralleled by intimate mano-a-mano duels to the death; in this case the climactic example of the latter is very effective and emotional something every Star Wars fan of good standing will find entirely compelling. Beyond that the very ending -- more like a coda really which was filmed on the extraordinary Skellig Michael off the western coast of Ireland -- is wonderful and sets things up perfectly for the next installment. In the end Star Wars The Force Awakens feels like the work of a very capable student one who has studied his subject so diligently and thoroughly that he knows what to do and what to avoid is smart enough to have engaged one of the experts in the field in this case Kasdan to work on the blueprint and to have ensured that another of the key contributor to the series success John Williams would return again after all the years. The franchise is indeed reawakened and we already know when to expect several more installments. See more Star Wars The Force Awakens Premieres in Hollywood Production Lucasfilm Ltd.

Ron Hubbard of Hollywood. Both men were sci-fi dreamers turned mega-millionaires who spun their pulp adventures into a religion. Tap the power within yourself they urged. The faithful forked over their dollars. Then both Lucas and Hubbard mucked up their simple premise with add-ons like magic floating particles and space lizards. Jar Jar has been banished his creator politely strong-armed offstage. Now a new J.J. -- J.J. Abrams -- commands our attention. His first commandment Scrap the nonsense. ""I thought it was a bunch of mumbo jumbo"" grunts Han Solo (Harrison Ford) whos never brooked any bullshit. Star Wars The Force Awakens steers the franchise back to its popcorn origins. Its not a Bible; its a bantamweight blast. And thats just as it should be a good movie nothing more. With six films already in the series and four since any of the good ones Abrams and co-writers Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt had to make Force a crowd-pleasing hit. To ensure it theyve copied the arc of the original A New Hope. Once again we open in medias res with a scroll of text a pan down to the stars and a beauty shot of a giant destroyer. And once again we have the Dark Side hunting a droid carrying a hidden message the orphaned desert scavenger who blunders into protecting it and that same old smuggler and his bipedal dog who inadvertently sign on as escorts even though Ford can barely be bothered to look nervous in a firefight.Abrams has added two fantastic characters played by 23-year-old actors who are clearly thrilled to be aboard. This desert orphan isnt a whiny Tiger Beat poster boy. Its an athletic resourceful girl named Rey (new face Daisy Ridley already a movie star in her very first film) whos introduced red-faced and sweaty in practical ankle boots. Just as charismatic is John Boyega as a former stormtrooper passing himself off as a resistance fighter. Finn or as hes originally called FN2187 -- ""Thats the only name they ever gave me"" -- was stolen as a baby and programmed from birth to obey. We meet him during his very first grown-up battle when his white plastic helmet is smeared by his friends blood. Seven films into the saga this is the only time were allowed to empathize with a grunt. The emotion doesnt last long. Soon were rooting for Finn and his new friends to pew-pew-die his former colleagues which is much less fun when you know theyre all brainwashed child soldiers. Related StoriesLA Weeklys Most-Read Film Stories of 2015A Lifelong Star Wars Fanatic Literally Wrote the Book on Princess LeiaOur heroes are pursued by yet another black-helmeted villain with inconvenient family ties whos been ""seduced"" by evil a funny verb of choice for such an asexual series (its as though good parents in Star Wars fear their virginal kids turning wicked from rose petals and Barry White). This new heavy-breathing creep Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) vowed allegiance to the Empire rebranded as the First Order but taking its marketing cues from the Third Reich. (Their nifty red white and black logo is a hexagon with fangs.) Can the Rebels -- er now theyre called the Resistance -- save the day in what literally plays like just one long day zipped through at light-speed without bathroom breaks? If not look out universe The bad guys have built a spherical weapon that blows up planets. And not just one measly Alderaan. Now they can explode a handful in one go. In this deja vu sequel everything is the same only bigger. To prove it Abrams layers a hologram of his new astral destroyer next to one of the Death Star where it dwarfs the original as a bowling ball does a grape. (In another curious word choice this murderball is powered by ""the sun"" not ""a sun"" or ""a star"" or as befits a mapped-out galaxy ""Tejat Prior."") You sense Abrams both slavishly worshipping Star Wars and hoping to show the old girl up as though the inner power plays of Lucasfilm are All About Eve with overgrown boys and their toys. Abrams has made some smart think-piece-pandering tweaks to the formula. Leia has been upgraded from princess to general and in the process dumped Han which couples therapists have seen coming ever since The Empire Strikes Back when the two spent so much time bickering they didnt notice theyd flown the Falcon inside a carnivorous slug. Lucas should apologize to nerd bachelors whove spent three decades thinking Han and Leia were a template for bliss. ""It wasnt all bad was it?"" Han asks. ""Some of it was ... good."" ""Pretty good"" Leia nods neutrally. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

He knows these dusted-off props and people will get applause just for popping up but he wants his camerawork to earn its share. Over and over he aims us at a target -- say a fancy spaceship toward which Rey and Finn dash -- then pivots and kablam we about-face for our first shot of something like the Millennium Falcon. ""That garbagell do"" Rey shrugs without reverence and indeed the Falcons 37-year-old 8-bit target-aiming graphics look about as useful as a busted Atari. Yet that rusticity is welcome after the overly shiny prequels. Abrams prefers humble wonders such as a powder that Rey stirs into boiling water which puffs up into green bread or an alien tavern meal of hollowed apples stuffed with romanesco broccoli that fractal farmers market delight. He favors stark landscapes where nature is the special effect. And with good reason. Whenever it leans too much on CG The Force Awakens trips over its own feet. There are killer beasts who look like blenders with tentacles and a Yoda-esque savant who resembles an upside-down pineapple cake. The worst offender is the fully animated Supreme Leader Snoke who looks like the animators said ""Oh you cast Andy Serkis for this? Screw it lets just draw Gollum burn his face and magnify him to the size of the Lincoln Monument.""Only once does the extravagant CG go from blunder to beauty. Toward the end of the film Abrams indulges in a close-up shot of Rey during a duel. Stare into her eyes and youll see hes added the reflection of lightsaber crosses. This gorgeous hero shot makes you want to follow Rey for the next two films of this holy geek trilogy. Hey maybe Lucasfilm wants to resurrect a religion after all.

Abramss rousing pitch-perfect triumph--a feast of nostalgic blockbustering. Not only expert homage for the fans but a first-rate energized piece of mega-Hollywood adventure the hugely anticipated Star Wars The Force Awakens stirs more to life than just the Force. The rollicking space-opera spirit of George Lucass original trilogy (you can safely forget the second trio of cynical tricked-up prequels) emanates from every frame of J.J. Abramss euphoric sequel. Its also got an infusion of modern-day humor that sometimes steers the movie this close to self-parody--but never sarcastically nor at the expense of a terrific time. The wheel need not be reinvented Virtually every plot point and action beat comes from 1977s Star Wars or 1980s The Empire Strikes Back (you even get a dormant lightsaber shivering in the snow) yet thats perfectly fine when the vigor is this electric. Life is still a drag on arid desert planets like Jakku where scrappy Rey (Daisy Ridley a strong-jawed find) sells scavenged parts of old battle destroyers. Crash-landing onto her world is Finn (John Boyega) a Stormtrooper shocked out of his violent path serving the evil First Order by an impulse to do the right thing. On the run they hijack the decrepit Millennium Falcon--""The garbage will do"" says Rey in the first of many exhilarating reveals--and take off toward a radicalizing destiny in the Resistance. Abrams (Star Trek Super 8) a master mimic unafraid to revive Lucass old-school wipes and frame-gobbling spaceships brings a light touch to the performances Theres better acting in The Force Awakens than in all the Star Wars movies combined. BB-8 a whirling soccer-ball-like droid that plays like WALL-Es mouthier cousin might be best of the bunch--hes a new high for cinemas expressive machines (and a nod to Lucass love for gearhead invention). Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher bring unexpected pathos to roles they sometimes used to drift through. The graying hair helps. But once again a black-clad villain steals the show Mystical Dark Sider Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) wears the robes face-obscuring helmet and ferocious demeanor of you know who with a distorted basso bark that actually improves on the breathy squawk of James Earl Jones. Fortunately the actor gets to do more than menace steering the movie toward a heartbreaking scene of personal confusion that plays like a franchise high. Elsewhere--and hilariously--the film is crammed with those effete British-accented middle managers gulping down fear in his presence. Quibblers who cant recognize a labor of love will point to the same old fascism a bigger Death Star a scummier cantina. But its wonderful to be back at the bar.

After reinvigorating the Star Trek franchise and take it to a new level he has done it again with this lets call it reboot. I have been waiting 32 years for the continuation of the Return of the Jedi. 32 years And JJ delivers. The prequel was like a spin off no comparison. Originally George Lucas said he always wanted to create 3 trilogies. Then he gave up and said he would only do the first 2 trilogies but now thanks to Disney (Disney) and JJ Abrams we have the final trilogy. Well at least the first installment. It was like being 12 again. John Williams score is still as fresh and great today as it was in 1977. The themes are similar to the original trilogy and run much closer to George Lucas original idea of the Star Wars universe than the prequel. No spoilers there are surprises twists familiar faces and a lot of action. The Millennium Falcon is back The characters have grown older and wiser. And the newcomers are superb. Well acted throughout; well written with bits of comedy here and there. I cant cant wait for the next one Like any other middle age (really?) fan my expectations were huge and I was not disappointed. Go run find the movie theater and watch it Now Seriously stop reading this and go Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 4 2016Evelyn DFeaturedIf you havent seen The Force Awakens yet get on it I saw it multiple times in the theaters. Youll notice new things each time you see it. Amazing acting cinematography special effects script everything. Fans old and new wont be disappointed. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 16 2016tmjh86FeaturedAfter watching Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull I made myself a pact that I would NEVER get excited about any sequels of my childhood favorite films (I left the cinema nearly in tears because I was so disappointed). Even with all the insane reviews that The Force Awakens was receiving I still was hesitant.Luckily however JJ Abrams absolutely nailed it with The Force Awakens. There was a perfect balance between the nostalgic and the new meaning that old-school audiences could enjoy and appreciate as well as new audiences. The film does follow a similar storyline to A New Hope and is just as epic in terms of storyline and plot development. Abrams has given me hope that remakes can actually be just as incredible as the originals and for that I owe him BIG TIME.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 16 2016Matthew LFeaturedThe Force Awakens is a great Star Wars movie and it feels good saying that. Its way way better than the prequels and Return of the Jedi. Its absolutely worth seeing.P.S. Here is something for those people who are going to spoil this movie for others. ""Those attempting to spoil Star Wars for others know that its the most attention youll likely receive in life"". - Quote by Chris StuckmannHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 13 2016Ryan JFeaturedOverall I did enjoy the movie very much.  Reminded me a lot of the original trilogy (a little too much at times) and the blend of practical and CGI was much preferable to the overdone CGI of the terrible prequels.  Really enjoyed the new characters Rey Poe and Finn and I really loved seeing the reintroduction of all the old characters.  Had a few very minor complaints about certain characters being a little too ""perfect"" at times although this might be explained in the sequels.    Cant wait to see what else the new movies and spin offs will have in store.  Definitely recommend to hardcore fans and casual fans alike.  Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 13 2016Ashleigh BFeaturedWhether youre a die hard fan (before it was cool to be) or have just jumped on the bandwagon this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that everyone can enjoy. I was so amazed at the different ages in the cinema ranging from two little girls behind me that were about 4 and 6 who knew more about every character than me to an elderly couple that looked just as excited. It is a rare film that can truly be cross generational and it is no wonder to see why. From beginning to end I was completely immersed in the characters and storyline and was on the edge of my seat with anticipation. The humor and visual aesthetic feel nostalgic and true to the original films but also fresh and original. Worth seeing in the cinema for the full effect Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 23 2015RalphFeaturedA must-see even if you do not like SF. The story has become universal and there is something in it for everyone. The director did a tremendous job by lifting this unprecedented sequel to yet another level. It outplays any other sequels like James Bond because it is a true sage reflecting the development of different personalities human robotic or alien alike.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 22 2015mafeloretotastemakerFeaturedWHAT A RETURN TO THE SERIESHonestly if you liked Star Wars at all you will love this. And if you dont even know what Star War is you will love this as well. The movie was made with so much love for its predecessors honoring everything about the franchise while injecting new life into it. The new characters are perfectly cast; Daisy Ridley is the best part of it all creating a character that you cannot help but root for. Cannot wait to see whats in store for Rey and companyIf you like anything awesome go see this nowHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/us/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens,200,starwarstheforceawakens48,starwarstheforceawakens,timeout

Yes it helps that the core group of original actors has returned but its more the energy humor and simplicity of direction that has been recaptured. Its the overall vibe.""The Force Awakens"" is very much an homage to the first ""Star Wars"" film right down to a nightclub filled with bizarre creatures and in so many other details and sequences. Yet it also introduces a group of (mostly) strong new characters who seem perfectly capable of carrying the banner forward.It also offers up a great new villain Kylo Ren played deliciously by Adam Driver. Kylo Ren literally worships at the altar of Darth Vader and wears a similar black mask although thankfully he takes it off once in a while to let Drivers heat out.Much as Vader before him Kylo Ren is one of the leaders of a new dark army the First Order which is out to conquer well everything and any planets they cant conquer theyre happy to blow up.The resistance to the First Order is being led by General Leia (Carrie Fisher). And the resistances first order of business is to find Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the last Jedi Knight whos gone into seclusion ever since his training of a protege went bad.Harrison Ford returns to the role of Han Solo the hero and one-time scoundrel in a galaxy far far away in ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" (Photo David James / Lucasfilm Ltd.)As the film opens a map that may lead to Skywalker is given to a resistance fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). But Poe is about to be captured so he inserts the map into an adorable little android named BB8 (sound familiar?). And BB8 scoots across the desert with mankinds hope of salvation.Meanwhile one of the First Orders storm troopers Finn (John Boyega) is forced to witness the slaughter of innocent villagers and suddenly realizes he doesnt want to be one of the bad guys. Back on the mother ship he helps Poe escape and Poes first priority is going back to pick up BB8.Unfortunately the ship Poe and Finn are on takes a hit and they land in the desert. Finn survives but cant find Poe. Luckily he does find a resourceful young woman named Ray (Daisy Ridley a star is born) who just happens to be hanging out with BB8. After a bit of discussion they agree they have to get BB8 to the resistance and the story takes off from there. Soon enough Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) show up and the partys on.Actually the partys pretty much on immediately in this movie and it rarely stops. Director J.J. Abrams who wrote the script with Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt hits the ground running and certainly delivers the most breathless ""Star Wars"" movie yet.Quibbles? Sure a few. Finn isnt really fleshed out and Poe is re-introduced with a sudden flimsy explanation. And with its basic premise of family dissonance as well as so many other familiar touchstones some may think the film too similar to the original.But lets face it; the original ""Star Wars"" was great. There are way worse role models. Simply put ""The Force Awakens"" makes you feel good about ""Star Wars"" again.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongStar Wars The Force AwakensGRADE B+Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violenceRunning time 135 minutes 626 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 34 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1YjiYgf MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/12/16/tom-long-star-wars-review-force-awakens/77395392/,200,starwarstheforceawakens49,starwarstheforceawakens,detroitnews
