The rest of us will simply utter a big collective ""Meh."" ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" is an ever-so-tasteful watered-down and unnecessarily-improved-upon adaptation of Lisa Sees bestselling 2005 novel of the same name. The novel a favorite with book club groups was set in 19th-century China and told the story of two women Lily and Snow Flower who though unrelated were paired together as ""laotong"" or sisters from childhood on. The novels allure was that it introduced western readers to and drew them deeply into a distant culture and time when friendship was the one bright spot in these womens difficult lives. Being a woman in China in the 1800s meant having ones feet tightly bound ones marriage arranged and little control or say regarding ones own life. Over the years the fortunes of the two women in the novel -- one marries up and the other down -become a study in contrasts. They spend years apart communicating only via notes written on a fan and yet their friendship and sisterly love endures despite distance and misunderstandings. The film version isnt content to leave well enough alone. It gives us Lily and Snow Flower but it also grafts on -- apparently for viewers too antsy to sit through a period piece -- a parallel contemporary story. This one is set in modern-day Shanghai and features Nina and Sophia two women who were girlhood friends but who have drifted apart as young adults. When Sophia after an accident lies in a coma a grief-stricken Nina comes to understand the importance of their friendship as she reads the manuscript of a novel Sophia has written telling Lily and Snow Flowers story (Snow Flower is a distant forebear of Sophias). Like a ping-pong game the movie keeps switching back and forth between its two eras and two pairs of women. In each time period the same actresses appear with Li Bing Bing who is Chinese playing Lily and Nina and Gianna Jun who is actually South Korean (and is billed in Korean movies as Ji-hyun Jun) portraying Snow Flower and Sophia. The trouble is that its all tell and very little show. The characters narrate what has happened and exchange notes about their lives but we rarely see them actually interacting or doing much of interest. (Of course it doesnt help that Sophia is in a coma leaving Nina to stand around looking stricken or moping.) What is left to hold ones interest are handsome sets and ornate costumes and hairstyles particularly in the olden days segments. Then theres the problem of just what this oh-so-tasteful movie is trying to say about the nature of these intense female friendships. Theres more than a hint of a lesbian subtext conveyed via lots of yearning looks especially on Ninas part in the present day story. But the film as directed by Wayne Wang (""The Joy Luck Club"") is too darned restrained and elliptical to actually go there so it all ends up feeling like a vaguely titillating tease. Anyone expecting what Howard Stern calls girl-on-girl action is going to be disappointed. What ""Snow Flower"" does having going for it is the chance- likely your only chance -- to hear Hugh Jackman sing in Mandarin. He pops up briefly as a possibly shady Aussie businessman in Shanghai who is Sophias beau. In one of his three short scenes he croons to Sophia in Mandarin while wooing her at a nightclub he owns. While Jackmans fans may have been longing for him to make a musical this sure isnt it. (From the Aint Marriage Grand Dept. Wendi   Murdoch the Chinese-born Yale MBA degree-holding wife of News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch is one of the movies two main producers. ""Snow Flower"" is being distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures the art house arm of the Twentieth Century Fox film company which is -- wait for it -- owned by News Corp.)

"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Snow Flower and the Secret Fan (PG-13) Director Wayne Wangs adaptation of Lisa Sees compelling novel takes too many liberties with a story that needed no alterations. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald8/4/2011 Editor rating 2.5 A film should never exactly mimic its source material -- books and films are entirely different media and they require different strategies. But the drastic alterations to Lisa Sees compelling novel about the lifelong friendship between two women in 19th century China are unsettling at least for fans of the original bestseller and they detract a bit too much from the story See so artfully told. The novel examines the bond between Lily and Snow Flower paired as laotongs or ""old sames"" a contracted friendship much like a marriage. The women communicate in nu shu a secret language writing their stories on a fan that passes back and forth between them and their friendship bolsters them as they endure all the hardships life has to offer (which were considerable during a period of time in which foot binding was a required -- and horrifically painful -- tradition). Wayne Wangs adaptation includes Lily and Snow Flower whose fates painfully shift over the years as the once-poor Lily gains wealth and power through her prestigious marriage while Snow Flowers destiny heads in a different less fortunate direction. But apparently the screenwriters decided that 19th century China was a bridge too far for contemporary audiences and so the main story is clumsily framed within a less interesting modern-day friendship about two women who have grown distant despite their closeness as teens. The idea isnt necessarily terrible but its not executed as well as it should be. To make sure the audience understands the stories are supposed to be parallel the actresses pull double duty Li Bingbing plays Lily and also Nina whos on her way to establish a New York office for her company. Right before shes due to leave she learns her old friend Sophia (Gianna Jun who also plays Snow Flower) has been in an accident and is in a coma. Before her accident Sophia was working on a book about Snow Flower (her great-several-times-over grandmother) a link to the past that feels forced and tenuous. The biggest problem is that the stories arent truly parallel The rift between Nina and Sophia seems inconsequential compared to the brave sacrifice Snow Flower makes in severing her ties to Lily because she fears her low connections will drag Lily down. Still both actresses are expressive and excel at reflecting myriad emotions in subtle ways and they slip perfectly into the skin of their screen personas disappearing as easily into the period costumes as they do into contemporary garb. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan moves slowly languidly; its art direction is often lovely and despite their truncated screen time Lily and Snow Flower do make you care about their fates. But you would have cared more without all the distraction. Cast Gianna Jun Li Bingbing Vivian Wu Russell Wong. Director Wayne Wang. Screenwriters Angela Workman Ronald Bass Michael Ray. Based on the novel by Lisa See. Producers Wendi Murdoch Florence Sloan. A Fox Searchlight release. Running time 120 minutes. Sexuality violence/disturbing images drug use.

As the businesswoman keeps a bedside vigil she reads the invalids unpublished manuscript a tale of two young women who are best friends in 19th-century Hunan province. Victims of foot binding class divides family cruelty and political unrest they find solace in a secret language writing to each other on a silk fan. In this lavish adaptation of Lisa Sees novel the complex chronologies of the parallel narratives are skillfully handled by director Wayne Wang which makes his reliance on unbridled sentimentality all the more irritating. Hugh Jackman who never met a song he didnt like has a cameo as Juns Australian husband a nightclub owner and bilingual crooner. In English and subtitled Mandarin.

Now he presents another look at Chinese sisterhood in ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" and it feels like a shallow imitation Imagine getting Kate Hudson when you expect Goldie Hawn. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan Bad Director Wayne Wang. Cast Bingbing Li Gianna Jun. Rating PG-13 for sexuality violence and drug use. Note At Harkins Camelview. >> Adapted from a popular novel by Lisa See ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" flops back and forth in time. In modern Shanghai the story focuses on two lifelong pals. Nina (Bingbing Li) is at the start of a thriving financial career while Sophia (Gianna Jun) is a rather aimless would-be novelist. Sophia is lying in a coma which conveniently allows Nina to poke through her belongings and find a manuscript. Thats where we meet 19th-century friends Lily (Li again) and Snow Flower (Jun again). If you are surprised by the fact that the lives of the literary women mirror the modern you havent seen enough bad TV movies. Wangs emphasis on the parallels between the two sets of women is forced and clumsy. Sure wearing designer high heels is a pain but does it really compare with having your feet bound? And no subtlety here as Wang makes sure you dont miss the point by giving us a close-up of Li rubbing her feet as well as a drawn-out sequence on the tradition of foot-binding. The film is visually sumptuous but emotionally inert. It never draws in the viewer. Some of that could be due to the constant shifts in time. The device tends to undercut the characters and robs the movie of momentum. By the time the story of Snow Flower and Lily starts to get interesting its back to modern Shanghai and Nina moping over her comatose pal. Wang directs Li and Jun to underplay their characters which also adds a rather cold feeling to the proceedings. It becomes really noticeable when Hugh Jackman pops up as Sophias boyfriend and his sheer movie-starness throws the film for a loop. Its terribly jarring; Wang could have cast Buzz Lightyear in the role and he couldnt have fit in any worse. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

Its the No-Joy Bad-Luck Club. In 19th-century China astrologically compatible 7-year-olds Snow Flower and Lily are matched for life as laotong an unbreakable bond of female friendship. In a society that demanded womens silence and subservience to husband and family the need for a bosom friend to share ones inner emotional life was crucial. Sees 2005 bestseller followed the BFFs through marriages and pregnancies and war; highborn Snow Flower loses all and lowly Lily grows rich but through all lifes changes they comfort each other. Whenever fate separates them they communicate by exchanging hand fans with private messages written in nu shu a secret womens phonetic language on the folding leaves. In a bid to add contemporary interest the film imposes a parallel modern story line with high school besties Sophia and Lin growing to adulthood in Shanghai while facing tough decisions about love careers and loyalty. Gianna Jun and Li Bingbing play both the ancient and modern pairs of friends. The actresses are fine but the double roles are a pointless contrivance and despite its handsome production design ""Snow Flower"" has a brain of solid popcorn. The film is sabotaged by a discordant structure that zigzags through eras and ricochets erratically from Chinese to English. Hugh Jackman pops up out of nowhere as an Australian club owner who serenades his beloved Sophia from a nightclub stage in Mandarin no less. This is a movie where incongruous things just happen without preparation or explanation amid a barrage of historical mile markers (2000s 1820s 1990s six years later one year earlier). Three screenwriters are credited; one imagines they had many fistfights. The movie dwells on the barbarities of foot-binding but makes sure were aware that executives in Christian Louboutin pumps get sore feet too. Also did you know that mothers-in-law can be awful opium is addictive and typhoid epidemics suck? The truth shall set you free.

Starring Bingbing Li Gianna Jun Vivian Wu Hugh Jackman Archie Kao Wu Jiang Angela Evans Director Wayne Wang Running time 200 Release Opened Jul 22 2011  Editorial Review Parallel stories dont hold upBy Stephanie MerryFriday Jul 22 2011As anyone who has uttered the words ""The book was better"" knows its not easy to distill hundreds of pages from a novel into an economical feature-length film. Something nearly always gets lost in the translation. Maybe that makes ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" the movie adaptation of Lisa Sees 2005 novel all the more puzzling. Screenwriters Angela Workman Ronald Bass and Michael Ray didnt just pare down the tale of two best friends in 19th-century China; they added a second parallel story set in modern day. The books-trump-movies camp knows where this is headed The film version - co-produced by none other than Wendi Murdoch (Ruperts wife) who clearly isnt having such a great week to begin with - contains two characters and one narrative too many. The movie opens in the current era as Nina prepares to move from Shanghai to New York for a job opportunity. A late-night call throws a wrench into her plans when she hears that her childhood best friend Sophia is unconscious and hospitalized after what appears to be a suicide mission that involved riding a bicycle on a highway. Among Sophias personal effects Nina finds a manuscript. Its the 19th-century story of two best friends Snow Flower - one of Sophias ancestors - and Lily who are bound together as laotong which translates to ""old sames."" Because they are born under the same sign and had their feet horrifically bound on the same day they are ordained by a kind of matchmaker to be best friends for life. And they are more than happy to comply. Even after they are forbidden from seeing each other they covertly send messages scrawled in a private language on the folds of a secret fan. As Snow Flower and Lily age acting duties go to Gianna Jun who also plays an adult Sophia and Li Bing Bing who portrays Nina. The film drifts between time periods and story lines and in case the parallels of these relationships arent clear the casting should drive the point home. Both friendships begin intensely and oscillate between intimate and strained before a final perceived betrayal. The film directed by Wayne Wang (whose eclectic filmography includes ""The Joy Luck Club"" ""Maid in Manhattan"" and ""Because of Winn Dixie"") emphasizes melodrama over character development until the proceedings feel like a rabbit hole of misfortune. There is an abusive husband a miscarriage suicide opium addiction lost fortunes an evil stepmother a plague a dying child and murderous rebels. When it seems things couldnt get worse Hugh Jackman (who plays Sophias ex-boyfriend) swoops in to croon a little ditty. This does lighten a mood that tends toward sorrowful and plodding set against a perpetually rainy backdrop. Amazingly the final moments of the film manage to mine the poignancy that should have permeated the preceding 90 minutes. Its not enough to make the movie worth the price of admission however especially when the paperback costs about the same.Contains sexual situations brief drug use disturbing images of bound feet and some language.

Fox Searchlight Pictures A scene from ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" (Fox Searchlight Pictures) Psychologists tell us that men form gangs while women from friendships. ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" based on a popular book by Lisa See is a mirror-imaged valentine between two sets of Chinese BFFs who live two centuries apart. While its colorful and well-intended most of the mawkish sentiments are written in crayon not calligraphy.Nina (Li Bingbing) is an executive in modern Shanghai who is preparing for a transfer to New York when she learns that her estranged best friend Sophia (Gianna Jun) has been critically injured in a car accident. Nina delays her trip and as she tries to piece together clues about her comatose friends recent whereabouts Nina flashes back to their school years when they signed a ""laotong"" oath to be inseparable.The oath was inspired by Sophias distant ancestor Snow Flower (also played by Jun) who signed a similar pledge in 1829 before her tiny-footed friend Lily (Li) was betrothed to a wealthy merchant. In both cases the friends become separated by class and geography. But poor Snow Flower and rich Lily keep their friendship alive by sending each other a fan on which they write their feelings.For its level of emotional insight the film might as well be called ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Platitudes."" In both stories men are mere brutes -- Hugh Jackman is wasted in the strange role of a lounge lizard who lures Sophia to Australia -- and even Snow Flowers son is just a lamb to be sacrificed to a sketchy subplot about political upheaval. If the two actresses playing dual roles werent enough of a linking device Sophia directly states that the manuscript shes writing about Snow Flower and Lily is really about herself and Nina. Yet the recurring crises in separate centuries become annoyances not archetypes. We feel as if were watching parallel puppet shows. Once weve quickly digested the fortune-cookie message that modern women are as bound by obligations as their grandmothers were all we can savor is the scenery.

More about Snow Flower and the Secret Fan >> Snow Flower and the Secret Fan takes Lisa Sees novel of female friendship set in 19th-century imperial China and intercuts it with a twinned tale of girlfriends in contemporary Shanghai. The connection between the two time frames and stories (the contemporary one with the addition of screenwriters) is flimsy as a frayed rope bridge forced as the stepsisters foot into Cinderellas glass slipper. Director Wayne Wang (The Joy Luck Club) takes this unwieldy script from Angela Workman Ron Bass and Michael Ray and makes it into a story of much visual grace and sadly considerable narrative awkwardness. The ravishing actresses Li Bingbing and Gianna Jun play the two sets of girlfriends. In the 19th-century story they are tightly wound Lily and relaxed Snow Flower who are introduced by a matchmaker as potential laotong (best friends). In the contemporary story they are tightly wound Nina and morose Sophia who meet as teenagers when Nina tutors Korean emigre Sophia in Mandarin. In both story lines decorative fans inscribed on their folds with nu shu a secret language shared by the women connect the women over distance and centuries. On the page the relationship between Lily and Snow Flower the central figures of Sees original story is one of sisterly affection laced with eroticism. On screen this platonic intimacy and intensity looks like repressed sexual desire. There are two movies here and I dont mean the different time frames. Ostensibly Snow Flower is about how despite the practices of foot-binding and arranged marriage Chinese women found strength and companionship in female friendship. The more poignant movie that Wang has made is about how despite the discontinuities in China because of the Taiping Rebellion of the 1850s and the Communist Revolution of a century later there is a continuity of shared history and experience. In the most poetic scenes of the film so evocatively shot by Richard Wong the ghosts of Lily and Snow Flower materialize in modern-day Shanghai. At these moments Wangs film has a visual eloquence and resonance that transcend its clunky dialogue and the forced parallelism of its two timelines.

"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan movie review by Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Source story gets short shrift in Snow FlowerSnow Flower and the Secret Fan a 2 starsJuly 21 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticLi Bing Bing and Gianna Jun in ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan.""The film version of ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" proceeds as if willed into being by a particularly misguided ""question for discussion"" the kind youd find at the tail end of a bestsellers paperback edition. The question would go something like this. What would happen to novelist Lisa Sees story of two 19th century Hunan province women and everything their friendship endures -- foot-binding arranged marriages tragic loss of children typhoid outbreaks political turmoil -- if that story were forced to share the screen with a parallel story that of two early 21st century Shanghai women one of whom has written the story set in the Hunan province of old? It would fall apart thats what would happen. ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" directed by Wayne Wang with as much feeling as an ill-starred screenplay allows may find its ideal audience in those who enjoyed the movie version of ""Julie amp; Julia"" but really only liked the modern-day stuff about the blogger with the less-than-riveting domestic crises. Produced by Wendi Murdoch she of the lightning-fast volleyball-trained reflexes ""Snow Flower"" begins with Sophia a rising businesswoman played by South Korean actress Gianna Jun offered a prestigious job transfer from Shanghai to America. Events of the previous few months we learn have brought her lifelong friendship with Nina (Li Bingbing) to an abrupt halt. Flashbacks reveal the conflicts; another set flash further back to 1997; meantime the manuscript Sophia has written relays the tale of Snow Flower (also played by Jun) and Lily (Bingbing). Some two-tier narrative structures locate the echoes and rhymes between eras; this ones just all over the place. The historical particulars deserve more effective dramatic treatment. Sees 2005 novel hinged on two key notions. The first is that of a young Chinese womans laotong or ""old same"" -- an arranged friendship deeper than marriage more durable than human suffering or geographical distance. Through the ages this ""deep-heart love"" was often expressed in nu shu a private language passed from woman to woman laotong to laotong typically by way of poems or sentiments written in the silk fabric of ladies fans. Aesthetic beauty married to intimate communication a fine place for any novel or film to begin. Did Sees novel really need a contemporary hook? Perhaps for financial reasons but certainly not for creative ones. Hugh Jackman not seen in any of the films promotional materials shows up as an Australian entrepreneur and nightclub singer in Shanghai charged with delivering back-story information. Jun and Bingbing throw themselves into their respective roles. But what can an actress do when a script credited to Ron Bass Angela Workman and Michael Ray with Bass doing most of the modern-day additions forces a pan-Asian ensemble into one too many English-language dialogue sequences and then has one character comment ""Enough of this silly English""? Also the gentle erotic undertow in the friendship of Snow Flower and Lily has been toned down and replaced by ... niceness. Lines from the novel such as ""a fire burned inside me far hotter than anything the gods could inflict on us through the mere cycles of the seasons"" are reduced to a glance or two and then its back to the Taiping rebellion or the latest wearying return to contemporary Shanghai and two characters who do not quite hold up their end of this pretty but pretty screwy adaptations enforced 50/50 bargain. mjphillipstribune.com Snow Flower and the Secret Fan -- 2 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for sexuality violence/disturbing images and drug use) Cast Gianna Jun (Snow Flower/Sophia); Li Bingbing (Nina/Lily); Vivian Wu (Aunt); Jiang Wu (Butcher); Russell Wong (Bank CEO); Hugh Jackman (Arthur) Credits Directed by Wayne Wang; written by Ron Bass Angela Workman and Michael Ray based on the novel by Lisa See; produced by Wendi Murdoch and Florence Sloan.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 15 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jul. 14 2011 636PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English When the screen adaptation of Amy Tans bestseller The Joy Luck Club - about the stories and conflicts of four Chinese women and their American-born daughters - hit theatres in 1993 director Wayne Wang looked like the second coming of George Cukor the famous Hollywood director known for literary adaptations and especially for coaxing strong performances from women. After steady career of wildly varied fare - from indie flick Smoke to romcom dross like Maid in Manhattan to his praised adaptation of Yiyuns Lis short story A Thousand Years of Good Prayers - Wang delivers another arthouse literary adaptation about female bonds (both hearts and feet - more on that later) with Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. But he doesnt have much luck with this joyless film. The main problem is the adaptation of Lily Sees well-reviewed novel - a bittersweet reminiscence of the friendship between two women in early 19th-century China - is essentially a secondary storyline. And its a shame because its visually compelling chronologically plotted dramatic scenes (the barbaric ritual of foot-binding a typhoid epidemic tense family life and an invading army that drives peasants into the hills) are annoyingly interrupted by a dominant newly fabricated story about the fractured friendship of the womens female descendents set in modern Shanghai. The two sets of friends are both played by Li Bingbing and Gianna Jun and their strong emotional performances show Wang at least hasnt lost his touch in terms of working with female actors. But all the flipping back and forth between two centuries - not to mention the weak modern story also moves around in time - never allows us to engage fully with the characters. In Shanghai Bingbing plays Nina a businesswomen whos about to move to the U.S. when her childhood best friend Sophia (Jun) from whom shes been estranged lands in a coma. Nina finds the manuscript of a historical novel Sophia has been writing about you guessed it the friendship between two women in early 19th-century China (i.e. Sees novel). As children Snow Flower (Jun) who comes from a prosperous family and Lily (Bingbing) from a lower class are bound together by a matchmaker in a laotong relationship a special bond that formalizes intimacy. When the girls get married off they can plan annual visits and communicate via ritual messages written on a secret fan in nu shu a script used only by women. Their fortunes shift when Lily marries a goods trader who is rarely at home and Snow Flower marries an abusive butcher. Maintaining the laotong proves a challenge. Every time modern Nina picks up Sophias manuscript its our cue that were heading back to the 1800s. When shes not reading shes either thinking back (cue flashback) to key moments of their friendship or sleuthing out events of Sophias life since their estrangement. Hugh Jackman plays Sophias Australian boyfriend a Shanghai nightclub owner. Its hard to figure out the purpose of this weird small role except that Jackman gets to sing an entire nightclub number in Chinese (what cant that guy do?). The juxtaposition of stories about women in old and new China may have been intended to widen the audience for Snow Flower and the Secret Fan but all it does is lose the heart and pathos of Sees novel in a jumbled mess. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan opens in Toronto and Vancouver on Friday and Aug. 5 in other cities to be confirmed.

"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan movie review Flick doesnt live up to its potential |       NJ.com comments Snow Flower and the Secret Fan movie review Flick doesnt live up to its potential Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 15 2011 at 733 AM View/Post Comments Courtesy Fox Searchlight PicturesLi Bing Bing and Gianna Jun in Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. If they end up succeeding theyre known in Hollywood as ""passion projects"" -- something someone pursued against all odds because of their belief in the material. If they dont theyre dubbed ""vanity projects"" -- something that got made only because of who the person is and the unwillingness of anybody to dare say no. It will be interesting to see what label eventually gets attached to ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan."" Wendi Murdoch -- the wife of the studio mogul -- fell in love with the Lisa See bestseller when she read it and became determined to turn it into a movie even though shed never produced one. So she brought on director Wayne Wang and screenwriter Ron Bass -- who last collaborated on ""The Joy Luck Club"" -- and conducted a pan-Asian search for actors to play the leads. Movie Review Snow Flower and the Secret Fan (PG-13) Fox Searchlight (108 min.) Directed by Wayne Wang. With Li Bing Bing Gianna Jun. In English and Mandarin with English subtitles. Now playing in New York. Rating note The film contains sexual situations violence and drug and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS Unfortunately the ends dont match the effort. Heavily rewriting the period-piece novel the film adds two young women in modern Shanghai go-getter Lily and bohemian Sophia. Then one night Sophia is taken to the hospital -- and Lily begins to wonder if she really knew her at all. So she tries to learn more by reading Sophias secret fiction -- a story about two young women from Imperial times whose close but complicated friendship keeps them going through hardship. Which is a cue for us to occasionally flash back to Sees original story set in deeply traditional 19th-century China and crammed with fascinating facts about a long-vanished culture. Particularly interesting to modern audiences is the feminist angle as these women find liberation in a secret language and in female friendships more intimate than any marriage. In fact these friendships are so close that they seem to be far more than that -- and you wonder if the womens relationship is ever going to take the leap into the physical. It doesnt -- but the close-ups of longing glances keeps that idea always close to the surface. Unfortunately -- and not surprisingly -- the ancient part of the story is far more interesting than the parallel modern one where the character conflicts turn into career-vs.-romance cliches and the appearance of Hugh Jackman as an Aussie show-biz boyfriend comes from left field. The insistence of using English dialogue for most of the modern story also does a disservice to star Li Bing Bing whose line readings turn stilted once she has to move away from her native Chinese. (Its less notable with Gianna Jun possibly because as a Korean her entire part is performed in one foreign language or another.) Admitted there are some strong moments here and some fascinating facts in Sees heavily researched original story (although the film squeamishly stints on the ugly details of foot-binding). And the whole things certainly a change of pace in the midst of this action-movie summer. But whatever passion might have been here to begin with never made it to the screen.

(News) BY Joe Neumaier DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Friday July 15 2011 400 AM THE TREE - 3 starsAfter a mans sudden death his family struggles to cope. With Charlotte Gainsbourg. (140) Not rated Adult situations. At the Beekman and Village East.Not to be confused with the recent ""The Tree of Life"" or ""If a Tree Falls"" director Julie Bertuccellis serene drama ""The Tree"" is its own excursion into spirits and anger in the natural world. Only here Dawn (Charlotte Gainsbourg) takes that idea literally After her husband suffers a fatal heart attack and drives his truck into the giant fig tree outside their Melbourne home her youngest daughter decides dads soul is now in the tree so she nestles into its branches to speak to him. Months later Dawn emerging from depression begins to believe that too even as she begins a new romance with her boss (Marton Csokas) that her four children disapprove of.Bertuccellis unassuming style allows plenty of room for the characters to breathe and Gainsbourg uses her elegant angular beauty to move Dawn from lost to searching to accepting never once making a false move. Adapted from an obscure British novel and lacking a solid third act ""The Tree"" falls short of being revelatory yet has a mysterious sturdy power that grows on you.SNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN - 2 starsA woman tries to reconnect with a friend while reading a story of 19th-century devotion. (140) PG13 Language. At the Angelika and Lincoln Plaza.Director Wayne Wang (""Chan Is Missing"" ""Smoke"" ""The Joy Luck Club"") works hard to add life to this film of Lisa Sees best-selling novel about friendship and love across three centuries. Unfortunately its present-day tale involving a career woman seeking to mend her 20-year bond with a girlfriend injured in an accident is lax and clunky and its story-within-a-story -- a tale of two laotong or soul sisters in oppressive mid-1800s China -- is gorgeous but simplistic. Actresses Gianna Jun and Li Bing Bing are each solid playing roles in both sections and thanks to the lush setting and epic misery that historical portion has the most pull. Still when taken together it all seems skin-deep.LIFE ABOVE ALL - 3 stars A young girl endures hardships in Africa. (144) PG-13 Violence. At Lincoln Plaza and Film Forum.This strong but unrelentingly sad South African drama about a young girls perseverance through everyday tragedies that would cripple most of us benefits most from young Khomotso Manyakas heartbreaking performance as 12-year-old Chanda. After her younger sister dies an event that incites fear and superstition in her dusty impoverished village Chanda stands strong even while helping a friend whos turned to prostitution urging her dead sisters father into sobriety and living with a well-meaning but oppressive woman after her mother succumbs to AIDS -- the real phantom her neighbors fear. Director Oliver Schmitzs rhythms take a while to ease into and admittedly there is never a bright moment. Yet like Chanda the movie stares clear-eyed at a world where any kind of hope seems like a dream.

Musetto View author archive Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) July 15 2011 | 400am Modal Trigger Li Bingbing (left) and Gianna Jun portray two pairs of female friends in this sentimental Shanghai-set tear-jerker. Youre advised to bring a hankie or two should you venture forth to see the tearjerker ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan."" Hong Kong-born Wayne Wang (""The Joy Luck Club"") directs the cross-generational chick flick from a novel by Lisa See. He weaves together two stories one set in China in 1829 the other in contemporary Shanghai. They deal with the relationships of two pairs of laotong -- unrelated women who declare themselves ""sworn sisters for life."" The same actresses Gianna Jun and Li Bingbing play both pairs of females -- Snow Flower and Lily in the 19th century and Sophia and Nina in modern times. Nina is a Shanghai businesswoman who cancels her big career move to New York when she learns that her estranged ""sister"" Sophia is in a coma after her bike is hit by a taxi. During her vigil at Sophias hospital bedside Nina is flooded with memories as the film crisscrosses between the parallel friendships. The title comes from the earlier story when Snow Flower and Lily isolated by their families communicate by writing in the folds of a white silk fan -- a pre-electronic form of tweeting if you wish. Much is made of foot-binding in 19th-century China a practice that was thought to make women more attractive to men. ""Only through pain will you find beauty"" is how one mother puts it. Id be more blunt ""That must hurt like hell."" Hugh Jackman appears briefly as Sophias Aussie boyfriend and gets to perform a lively song-and-dance number. But for some strange reason his name isnt in the credits.

Li Bing Bing in Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. Photo Courtesy Fox Searchlight Picture Snow Flower and Secret Fan review Disappointing 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Snow Flower and the Secret Fan Drama. Starring Bingbing Li and Gianna Jun. Directed by Wayne Wang. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" has such seriousness and purpose behind it that for 10 or 15 minutes it could be mistaken for a good movie. But this latest from director Wayne Wang about the friendship of two young women travels from 2011 to 1997 to 1829 to 1838 in search of a reason for the audience to keep watching and start caring. That reason is never found. The screenplay written by three people and based on the novel by Lisa See stays locked in situations and never graduates into a story never comes up with some element of suspense or some unresolved question that the audience needs to see answered. In the first minutes a rising young executive in Shanghai Nina (Bingbing Li) finds out that her childhood best friend Sophia (Gianna Jun) has been seriously injured in a traffic accident. Perhaps the filmmakers hope was that the audience would care whether Sophia lives or dies. The audience cares about her as much as you do reading this. Wang goes back in time to show us the girls as teenagers in 1997 pledging their eternal friendship. But this is typical of the screenplay We keep hearing that these girls are friends but theres nothing precious or dynamic about their interaction that makes us believe it or feel it. Then just as were hungry to learn more about Nina and Sophia Nina finds an unfinished novel in Sophias backpack and - oh no - the novel is set in 1829. Related Stories Snow Flower wilts under self-importance Brace yourself for more flashbacks with the story of Lily and Snow Flower true friends from childhood whose fortunes diverge in adulthood. In their adult incarnations Lily and Snow Flower are played by the same actresses who play Nina and Sophia and for the rest of the movie Wang alternates modern-day scenes with scenes from the 19th century. But Lily and Snow Flowers friendship is no more arresting or interesting than the one set in modern times. Wangs direction is disappointing throughout. True he is not working with the best material. The story is moribund hes juggling multiple time periods and much of the dialogue is so awkward as to be laughable. But it was Wangs choice to direct all the scenes as though they were of equal importance and to invest in virtually every one of them an atmosphere of heavy portentousness. You ever get chased in a dream and find your legs can barely move? Heres your chance to have that experience while awake. Unsuccessful though it is ""Snow Flower"" was made by intelligent people and so the incidental pleasures are of high order. The insanity of foot binding - the pain it involved but also the opportunities it provided girls with that eras notion of perfect feet - is explored in detail. We also get a vivid picture of the hardship of Chinese peasant life in the 19th century. I mean thats interesting isnt it? Isnt it? Curiously the movie seems at the end to be extolling a highly dysfunctional model of female friendship one in which women stay locked in the patterns of childhood with no escape. This is the least of the movies faults but may be the most peculiar. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

"Snow Flower loses its bloom rather quickly - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Snow Flower loses its bloom rather quickly By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Posted | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions The lesson of the lovely-looking but disappointing Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is avoid tinkering too much with a novelists work. Fox Searchlight Lifelong friends parallel stories Li Bing Bing left and Gianna Jun play dual roles in director Wayne Wangs latest film. EnlargeClose Fox Searchlight Lifelong friends parallel stories Li Bing Bing left and Gianna Jun play dual roles in director Wayne Wangs latest film. Director Wayne Wang and three screenwriters add a contemporary section to Lisa Sees 2005 novel set during the 19th century and the film bogs down because of it. Perhaps Wang added the modern-day story to heighten relevance to Sees tale set in the Hunan province in the 19th century. But the modern story lacks substance and descends into soap opera. Lead actresses Li Bingbing and Gianna Jun mostly speak in English in the movies contemporary portion. Neither seems comfortable with the language (Li is Chinese and Jun is Korean) which undercuts emotional scenes and renders them stilted. In contrast the historical part with dialogue in Mandarin has none of these drawbacks. Early scenes of binding feet and other traditional customs are powerful and the strong friendship between Snow Flower (Jun) and Lily (Li) is portrayed convincingly. But just as the historical drama grows most interesting were yanked back to modern times. Lily and Snow Flower are connected as children by an ancient bond known as laotong (loosely translated as ""old sames"" akin to soul mates). Theirs is a life-long friendship. Laotong is based on a formula of similar birthdates and the date feet are bound. Bound feet are crucial to the direction their lives take in this rigidly patriarchal society. The women are married off to the best possible prospects -- largely determined by the size and delicate curve of their wounded feet. In the parallel story set in modern-day Shanghai Jun plays Sophia an adventurous sort who has an accident. Li is Nina a driven businesswoman. As teens they forged their own sworn laotong friendship but they later drift apart. Sophia has a fling with an Australian businessman (Hugh Jackman). Nina rather inexplicably disapproves of him. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan   out of four Stars Li Bingbing Gianna Jun Hugh Jackman Director Wayne Wang Distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures Rating PG-13 for sexuality violent/disturbing images and drug use Running time 1 hour 40 minutes In select cities Friday Wang directed the wonderful adaptation of Amy Tans Joy Luck Club. He seems to be adapting Sees straightforward historical tale of friendship into Tans contemporary cross-generational style. Perhaps this was intended to draw the largely female crossover audience that went to Joy Luck Club. But the dual stories dont mesh well.

Video courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern July 15 2011 So many good films come to bad ends but not the tales of Harry Potter. The final episode of Harrys epic journey part 2 of ""The Deathly Hallows"" is the best possible end for the series that began a decade ago. In contrast to part 1 which was a ponderous exercise in stage-setting and dramatic incipience this film directed by David Yates and adapted by Steve Kloves is a climax worthy of the term. Its a dark and thunderous pageant that sets its bespectacled hero in the midst of vast forces yet never loses track of who he is--a brave boy to borrow both parts of Dumbledores fond phrase on the way to becoming a wonderful man. (Daniel Radcliffe in his turn has grown from likeably bland at the outset to impressively--and still likeably--confident.) ENLARGE Daniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. Warner Bros. Pictures Keeping the audience so closely connected with Harry is a remarkable achievement considering the intensity of the action that swirls around him a roller-coaster ride down to the Gringotts vaults; a dragon-back ride back up; serpentine menace on a cosmic scale; wands sizzling towers toppling; Hogwarts besieged and aflame; and in the shoot-out that will define humanitys fate not to mention Harrys future Voldemort and his evil allies wielding weapons of sufficient energy to put the Hadron Collider in the shade. ""Is it real?"" Harry asks at one point ""or is it happening inside my head?"" You can understand his perplexity and you can choose your level on which to savor his mentors answer ""Of course its happening inside your head Harry. That doesnt mean its not real."" The Harry Potter film series is coming to an end but Warner Brother hopes to keep the magic alive. Kelsey Hubbard talks with WSJs Michelle Kung about the studios plan to maintain the popularity of Harry Potter beyond the blockbuster films. J.K. Rowlings books first hit the screen when computer-generated imagery was coming into the fullness of its power and the beginning of its abuse. Some of the movie versions used the new technology to create new realities while others abused it to the point of banality. Until now the film that struck the best balance between technology and humanity was by widespread agreement ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" which was directed by the Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron. But all of the movies like all of the books were as real as they were and as successful precisely because they were happening inside our heads. The books have been rightly hailed for inciting a generation of kids to read. Yet the Harry Potter movies--good and occasionally indifferent though never bad--deserve thanks for inciting a sense of wonder in a generation of kids whove been shortchanged by the movie business. As a failed Harry Potter scholar I must have missed in my Muggling way countless intricacies of the surpassingly convoluted plots. Thats why I took special pleasure this time from Harrys question to his friends ""When have any of our plans actually worked? We get there and all hell breaks loose."" But Ill also miss my periodic encounters with Harry Ron and Hermione and with the small army of British and Irish actors who made these films a distinguished performers pantheon Michael Gambon and before him the late Richard Harris; Alan Rickman Maggie Smith Ralph Fiennes Robbie Coltrane David Thewlis Helena Bonham Carter John Hurt Timothy Spall Brendan Gleeson Gary Oldman and Jim Broadbent. Wizards all. Tabloid Call it smart luck the release this very week of a film that chronicles the historical excesses of British tabloid journalism. (Its focus is a tabloid sensation of the late 1970s.) Luck plays a role for the obvious reason Errol Morriss documentary was made and scheduled for release long before the News of the World story broke. The smart part is that the film dissects those excesses deftly with a quasitabloid style of its own. ENLARGE Joyce McKinney in Tabloid. Sundance Selects The subject that sent the tabs into such a lather--and provoked a high-stakes duel between the Daily Express and Daily Mirror--was Joyce McKinney a former Miss Wyoming who claimed an IQ of 168 and had a genius for self-promotion. Giving just the facts maam is easier said than done given the claims and counterclaims that swirled around her English adventures. What seems relatively clear though is that she became enamored of or obsessed by a Mormon missionary named Kirk Anderson; that he went missing in 1977 in Surrey England; that he reappeared a few days later and that he told the police hed been abducted driven to a cottage in Devon chained to a bed and then raped by Ms. McKinney. Factuality has its friends in this world but not among the practitioners of tabloid journalism. As soon as the alleged rapist was arrested and charged she became the heroine--or reviled heavy--of what became ""The Case of the Manacled Mormon."" While the Express portrayed her as a veritable nun and tragic victim the Mirror branded her a sex-crazed part-time hooker. Delving into newspaper files of the day Mr. Morris displays lurid stories and extravagant layouts that fairly leap off the page. But the centerpiece of his ode to sensationalism is Ms. McKinney herself. First shes seen in archival footage as a demure wood nymph wandering around a long-ago suburban greensward as she reads from the preface to her autobiography ""Once upon a time there was a little princess the most beautiful princess in all the land."" Then she appears in the present as a flirtatious full-fleshed blonde with a kewpie-doll smile and flashing eyes that cant conceal a fugitive sadness. No circulation-crazed editor could make up the stuff Ms. McKinney says. Can a woman rape a man? ""No"" she replies"" I think thats like putting a marshmallow in a parking meter."" Did she rape Mr. Anderson? ""I was like his little wifey almost"" she purrs. ""I wanted to give him lots of babies in my tummy."" Did she jump bail and flee the country as the official record shows? ""I never fled. Dont use the word fled. I left."" One might infer that she has taken leave of her senses when she talks about her service dog Booger who could dial 911 on command and who was cloned in Korea into five miniBooger puppies one of which at the age of five months opened the door of her minibar. But shes not just a tabloid concoction shes a real person with a grievance that will not go away ""I dont see any connection between cloned puppies and a 32-year-old sex-in-chains story but those connections never die."" ENLARGE Above Bingbing Li and Gianna Jun in Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. Twentieth Century Fox Snow Flower and the Secret Fan Friendship between women--the deep and secret friendship of ""sworn sisters"" in Chinese society--forms the core of Wayne Wangs film which was adapted from the popular novel by Lisa See. The original setting was 19th-century China but the screen version weaves a parallel tale on two additional time lines--present-day Shanghai and the same city in the 1990s. This structural complexity proves an insuperable barrier to effective storytelling. While the action flashes back and forth in increments of centuries years or months were adrift in the here and now trying to get a grip on the characters and their relationships yet finding it loosened with every new dislocation. (The screenplay was written by Angela Workman Ronald Bass and Michael Ray.) Watch a clip of ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" a story set in 19th century China centered on the lifelong friendship between two girls. Courtesy Fox Searchlight. The parallelism extends to the performers. Gianna Jun and Bingbing Li play the dual roles of Snow Flower and her beloved Lily in the 19th century and young women named Sophia and Nina in the present and recent past. Theyre more interesting though seldom compelling in the historical sections which are themselves more interesting for the density of detail gleaned from the novel--the shared excruciation of foot binding the secret language with which the friends communicate the irresolvable conflict between their love for one another and the pull of dutiful wifedom. Modern Shanghai in ceaseless evolution is interesting to look at--Richard Wongs beautiful cinematography reminded me of ""Phantom Shanghai"" a superb book of photos by the Canadian photographer Greg Girard--but the phantom China of long ago is where the film comes to life whenever it stops there for a truncated visit. Life Above All Watch a clip from the 2010 South African drama ""Life Above All"". Courtesy Sony Pictures Classics. ""You amaze me"" says a South African mother to her 12-year-old daughter. No wonder. The daughter Chanda--shes played with lovely simplicity by a first-time actress Khomotso Manyaka--understands the world as her mother does not. Chanda sees a self-styled doctor for the quack that he is. She knows her mother and her drunken stepfather have AIDS even though her mother chooses to believe shes been bewitched. She knows that AIDS is a disease to be treated not a condition to be borne in secrecy and shame. Yet all that knowing may not be enough to see her through. ""Life Above All"" which was directed by Oliver Schmitz concerns itself with a classic theme Can a good child from a poor family steer clear of the pitfalls that surround her? Its also about the scourge that AIDS remains and above all about love. This is a modest film and an affecting one. Salvation Boulevard The blithering innocent at the center of this send-up of Christian evangelicals a former Deadhead named Carl (Greg Kinnear) has transformed himself into an acolyte of Pastor Dan an amoral preacher played by Pierce Brosnan. The movie transforms a dim idea--""Elmer Gantry"" lite--into comedy thats dead in the water and as dull as it is broad. Watch a clip of ""Salvation Boulevard"" a modern comedy based on the book by Larry Beinhart. Courtesy IFC Pictures. The filmmaker George Ratliff directed from an adaptation he did with Douglas Stone of a novel by Larry Beinhart. He didnt trust his audience to know when somethings funny so his film is full of smarmy grins outsize leers wry grimaces and eccentric walks as well as accidents near deaths deaths and an antic kidnapping all of it striving for an absurdist style but seldom getting past absurd. The cast includes Jennifer Connelly as Carls fanatically religious wife Ed Harris as Pastor Dans atheist adversary and Marisa Tomei as a former Deadhead turned security guard. Theres no accounting for what good actors will do under the spell of broad direction which can lead them to believe theyre being liberated from their disciplined selves. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Fast Cheap amp; Out of Control and Amandla Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) Far be it from me to detract from Alfonso Cuarons achievements (or those of David Yates in the present case) but Mike Newell also did right and then some by this fourth episode in the series. Dark and scary--so much so that its rated PG-13--the film is bursting with such brilliant effects as a flying coach drawn by seven white birds and a fully rigged ship rising from beneath a lake. The most remarkable spectacle though is that of Harry Ron and Hermione becoming creatures who can almost pass for grownups. Fast Cheap amp; Out of Control (1997) Errol Morriss fondness for weirdness and obsession has found no finer flower than this documentary about four control freaks and the animals or quasianimals that dominate their lives. The subjects are a lion tamer an expert on hairless mole rats a topiary gardener (green animals lovingly groomed) and a scientist who builds robots that crawl like bugs. The lion tamer explains why chairs are useful in his trade They have four legs while animals have one-track minds. And not just lower animals to judge from the movie. The sharp-eyed photography is by Robert Richardson. Amandla (2002) One drawback of black South Africas passion for music we learn here is that it sometimes gave away military positions during the climactic struggle against apartheid in the 1970s. Before guerrilla fighters attacked they would always sing. That is surely the only drawback. As this magnificent documentary about South African music shows protest songs amounted to weapons of war for a desperate people who needed to sing so they wouldnt weep. ""Amandla""--the Xhosa word for ""power""--was produced over a period of nine years by Lee Hirsch and Sherry Simpson and directed by Mr. Hirsch.

What should be a moving testament to the enduring friendship between two Chinese women instead plays like a bewildering apologia for co-dependency issues in ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan."" Mawkish clunky and unenlightening about female suffering in this or any generation director Wayne Wangs nuance-free adaptation of Lisa Sees 2005 bestseller suggests a stray thread wisely discarded from the helmers ""The Joy Luck Club"" and looks to deliver perhaps a fraction of that 1993 hits B.O. impact in limited release. Asian/distaff appeal and the source materials popularity could improve Fox Searchlights fortunes in ancillary. Rather than faithfully adapting Sees saga about the uncommonly intimate bond between 19th-century gal pals Lily (Chinas Li Bingbing) and Snow Flower (South Koreas Gianna Jun) Wang has his scribes cook up a soapy framing device set in 1990s Shanghai featuring the same actresses cast as two urban women facing similar tests of friendship. Successful businesswoman Nina (Li) is preparing to move to her firms new Gotham headquarters when she learns her estranged best friend Sophia (Jun) has been involved in a near-fatal bike crash. With Sophia lying comatose for most of the picture the jittery time-shuffling script piles on flashbacks to the girls marginally happier teenage years before contriving to have Nina read the novel Sophia was working on before her accident. Sophias manuscript (which bears the films title) initiates a scenic transition to a village in Hunan province around 1829. There Lily (played as a child by Guo Congmeng) and Snow Flower (Dai Yan) are ritually paired as laotong or lifelong companions -- a mutually beneficial arrangement (in theory) intended to make both girls more desirable in the eyes of potential suitors. Central to their blossoming relationship is the exchange of secret messages written on white silk fans using a unique language taught exclusively to women. But while Lilys tiny perfectly bound feet soon land her a high-born husband poor Snow Flower must content herself with a lowly and abusive butcher (Jiang Wu). Lilys in-laws urge her to shun Snow Flower a typhoid epidemic breaks out and eventually the Taiping Rebellion begins the historical import of which is treated as secondary to the dramatic obstacle it poses to Lily and Snow Flowers relationship. Back in the present day opportunity knocks for Nina while Sophia drifts aimlessly through life forcing the smart capable woman to make repeated sacrifices for her less-privileged friend. Lurching inelegantly back and forth in time and resisting no opportunity to draw facile parallels along the way (the significance of which is hammered home by lines like ""Fate has taught me that I am just another woman"") the film clearly attempts to make some sort of statement about the universal nature of gender-based oppression and the transcendent power of sisterhood from one epoch to the next. The coarse conclusion it leaves us with is that history essentially doesnt matter; certainly it cant compete here with the films fetishization of female friendship which remains strictly platonic yet takes on an almost idolatrous intensity. Not surprisingly men are almost entirely marginalized here a repressive force lurking outside the frame. Wang renders Lily and Snow Flowers tale with none of the attention to class specifics and precise character detail found in Sees novel. Yet its still preferable to that of Nina and Sophia who are forced to speak in stilted English -- a commercially motivated decision that squanders Li and Juns naturally expressive gifts though both actresses come off better elsewhere. Bit-player casting of Hugh Jackman as Sophias nightclub-star boyfriend (offering the thesp an incongruous showcase for his singing chops) feels like an obvious attempt to inject this drab picture with some pizzazz and prestige. Pic was largely spearheaded by first-time producer Wendi Murdoch the wife of currently embattled News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch who owns the pictures North American distributor. Period trappings are fine but unremarkable. D.p. Richard Wong provides a tidy visual contrast between a warmer more sumptuous look for the 19th-century scenes and cooler more muted tones for the contempo ones; neither story seems to advance for more than a minute without being shellacked in Rachel Portmans string-heavy score. Dialogue is often not just bad but badly dubbed.

TWITTER Snow Flower and the Secret Fan demonstrates the Chinese-American director Wayne Wang remains one of the worldas best directors of women. Like The Joy Luck Club a film to which his latest film will no doubt be compared Wayne Wangs Snow Flower and the Secret Fan enters the world of women with complete openness to its sensory sights and sounds its codes of behavior secrets of the heart and sturdiness of the soul. It does this through parallel stories one set in contemporary Shanghai and the other taking place in 19th century Hunan province in central China. Sometimes the switches in time and use of the same two actresses playing roles a century-and-a-half apart are awkward. But so strong are the emotions -- and yes the melodrama -- that Snow Flower and the Secret Fan represents one of Wangs best films to date. Brought to the North American market with little fanfare or budget no stars known outside of Asia (except brief scenes with Hugh Jackman) and without a build-up of laurels and reviews from prestigious festivals the film will have to fight to survive in art houses which can be tougher than mainstream cinemas. But the quality of the filmmaking and acting along with word of mouth just might bring Fox Searchlight a modest success. Certainly women will embrace this one. The film could also attract attention and one hopes not too negative due to the current travails of News Corp. in the U.K. as its producers are Wendi Murdoch and Florence Sloan the wives of media magnate Rupert Murdoch and ex-MGM CEO Harry Sloan respectively. Angela Workman Ron Bass and Michael K. Rays screenplay is based partially on Lisa Sees 2005 novel about a lifetime female friendship in 19th century China. Wang and his producers smartly saw the need to bracket this story with a contemporary one which goes a long way toward illustrating the changing roles of women in Chinese society. The film begins by introducing the concept of ""laotong"" a contractual arrangement between women even from different classes as is the case here that makes them sworn sisters for life. The parallel stories each concern laotong. In present day Shanghai Nina (Li Bingbing) is summoned by a hospital to the bedside of Sophia (Korean actress Gianna Jun) her laotong from whom she has been estranged. Sophia lies in a coma the victim of a traffic accident. Nina discovers the manuscript of a story Sophia is writing about a female ancestor. She immerses herself in the manuscript and this of course provides the story of Snow Flower (Jun) and Lily (Li) two little girls who pledge themselves to each other in 1829. Sophia is of course writing about herself and Nina. Everything about the period story speaks to womens oppression in the near feudal society of provincial China. Girls feet are bound from the time they are toddlers. This torture -- the women are shown walking with delicate halting steps even as adults -- results in ""beautiful"" tiny feet that will supposedly secure prosperous husbands. (Please notice that Florence Sloans production company is called Big Feet.) Arranged marriages spousal abuse and little status within the husbands family complete a bleak picture. The contemporary Shanghai women are seen as cosmopolitan English-speakers rising to the top of corporations and having their choice of men. But in how Wang portrays them and even frames them in certain scenes they seem every bit as lonely and lost as their ancestors. Wang seems to be suggesting that as in the west things have changed dramatically as far as women are concerned but in other respects things dont change at all. With so much cultural historical and sociological material to cover along with the arcs of two sets of female characters the film often seems like a progression of talky scenes that must fulfill any number of obligations. Consequently Snow Flower doesnt hit its stride until the second act and many scenes appear directed more toward western audiences needing education in Chinese history and customs. The portrait of men in both time periods is uninviting and superficial; indeed little has gone into bringing to life any of the supporting roles. Fortunately Wang remains one of the worlds best male directors of women. His camera is incapable of not discovering beauty and wisdom in womens faces. He sees every flaw yet also sees the heart that accounts for the mistakes and unbridled passions. Li luminescent in both periods is always the concerned self-sacrificing sister who worries herself to death over her laotong. And Jun who took a crash course in Mandarin to play this role (and whose Korean accent is accounted for in the storyline) beautifully conveys the sister who must deliberately ""disappoint"" her laotong in order to free them both at least temporarily from their mutual obligations. This film sets up each to become international name actresses. The heart of the movie is about female loyalty and love that know no bounds. Aiding and abetting Wang in this is the radiant cinematography of Richard Wong the just-so perfection in Man Lim Chungs production and costume designs and the melodious melancholy musical score of Rachel Portman.

Share Tweet Though his careers wandered down plenty of other interesting (Smoke) and less interesting (Because Of Winn-Dixie) paths director Wayne Wang will always best be known as the premier chronicler of the lives of Chinese-Americans and Chinese in America on screen from his influential debut Chan Is Missing to The Joy Luck Club. Its a subject hes returned to recently with 2007s digitally shot double feature A Thousand Years Of Good Prayers and The Princess Of Nebraska and in Snow Flower And The Secret Fan he takes a step further setting the film entirely in China. Adapted from Lisa Sees novel of the same name and chronicling two female friendships separated by centuries this latest film aims for The Joy Luck Clubs crossover appeal but ends up stilted and emotionally remote. Sees book is about the lives of two sworn friends in the 19th century Lily (Li Bingbing) and Snow Flower (My Sassy Girls Gianna Jun) and the film adds a present-day thread in which the same actresses play women living in Shanghai with Lily preparing to transfer to New York and Snow Flower struggling after a failed relationship with a expat nightclub owner (Hugh Jackman who sings in Mandarin). The parallel stories allow for interesting echoes The theme of bound feet in the older tale is matched to a shot of contemporary Lily massaging her insteps after shucking off a pair of high heels. But the structure also means that the arcs of both friendships are compressed when theyre supposed to epic. In the past the two girls are quickly separated by their respective marriages and much of their communication takes place via messages written on silk fans. The present is framed like a mystery with Lily investigating her estranged besties life after Snow Flower is badly injured in a car accident. The restrictions placed on the choices available to these women come through more strongly than their connections to each other and the value of deep friendship is discussed more than its portrayed onscreen. Some of awkwardness is due to the fact that the Korean Jun and Chinese Li spend half the film speaking English with which neither seems comfortable. (Jun reportedly took Mandarin lessons to prepare for her scenes as Snow Flower though at least some are dubbed.) The subtext intentional or not that emerges from the films overabundance of comforting embraces and face-caressing is that beneath this sisterly love spanning the ages is a deeply repressed love that dare not speak its name.

Lily (Li Bingbing) and Snow Flower (Gianna Jun) are two close friends who must contend with the rigidly patriarchal culture of 19th-century rural China. Their travails are mirrored by those of two women in modern-day Shanghai also played by Li and Jun. Sadly rather than melding the best of two worlds the film only takes the worst of their soap operas.

Soon Nina discovers the manuscript of a novel that Sophie had been writing which turns their long-term friendship (cemented as teens dancing to contraband Faye Wong tapes fractured by diverging adult choices--like Sophies ostentatious romance with Hugh Jackman) into the tale of the lifelong bond between two 19th-century Chinese women Lily and Snow Flower (also played by Li and Jun). In squeezing the raw material of Lisa Sees 2005 period novel through a partly contemporary frame director Wayne Wang adds a charge of relevance to a story otherwise hinged on the dated traumas of foot binding and arranged marriages playing up Chinas rapid modernization while effectively suggesting that the secret rituals of female friendship transcend generations. While the constant cross-cutting between past and present draws attention to the productions inconsistencies (in the olden days people apparently made a lot of declarative expository statements like ""Now the typhoid epidemic is upon us""; in the modern sections the women speak in stilted English thats sometimes indecipherable) when Wang very occasionally allows the two periods to merge its strangely provocative. As the parallel friendships evolve over time both push and pull between platonic and erotic; its to the films credit that it never definitively suggests that love can only be one or the other.
