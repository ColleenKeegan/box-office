Pictures Samuel L. Jackson and Alexander Skarsgard in The Legend of Tarzan. Sections of this film are so imaginative and so lovely that they deserve our open-heartedness not our scorn Conceptually at least David Yates The Legend of Tarzan starring Alexander Skarsgard as the fantastically brawny lord of the jungle just cant win. Its adapted from a series of boys adventure books written in the early 1900s when racial and social awareness wasnt anything close to what it is today and ""colonialism"" wasnt yet a word that was always preceded by ""the evils of."" The world is better off now that weve learned--or at least are learning--to think and talk about these things. But what about Tarzan Edgar Rice Burroughs English and very white lord raised in the African jungle by apes a man in tune with his body and with nature but one who must also eventually adjust to the mores of civilization? The ape-man has lived for a very long time through Burroughs books and through almost countless movie and TV adaptations including the Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen OSullivan films of the 1930s and early 40s--which were it should be noted insensitive to issues of race. So what are we supposed to do with Tarzan now that we know better? It would be easier maybe to retire him forever than to try to replace his loincloth of casual unselfconsciousness with a specially designed supergarment of awareness and sophisticated thinking. But its impossible for art to move things forward if we simply think of the past as a place where everyone got everything wrong. With The Legend of Tarzan Yates--who directed four of the Harry Potter movies infusing all of them with the proper velvety moody magic--gives us the best possible Tarzan for our time one who seems to know intuitively what a complicated minefield hes stepping onto. That doesnt diminish the pleasures of the movie--it simply makes us feel better about savoring them. And sections of The Legend of Tarzan are so imaginative and so lovely that they deserve our open-heartedness not our scorn. In the framing story of this Tarzan Christoph Waltz appears as Leon Rom an evil diamond-hungry henchman of Belgian King Leopold II who in this movie as in real life colonized the Congo in the 1880s to horrific effect. (The script written by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer borrows liberally from history and from certain real-life characters.) Skarsgards Tarzan who as the movie opens has already shed his jungle gear to become John Clayton Earl of Greystoke is living in London with his wife Jane (Margot Robbie)--the backstory of how they met and fell in love years earlier in Africa will be told later in flashback. The British government--or someone--is trying to coax Clayton to return to Africa to check up on what the terrible Leopold is up to. Hes reluctant until a visitor from America George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) speaks up He has heard that Leopold is enslaving the inhabitants of the Congo. Clayton cannot let that stand so he Williams and Jane head to Africa where theyre met by Rom and his cronies. Theres a violent clash and Clayton--who has by now stripped down to Hulk-style breeches that barely stretch across the expanse of his uncannily developed leg muscles--summons the memory of his old life as Tarzan orphaned as an infant and raised by a loving mother ape to become master of the jungle world. George Washington Williams was a real-life figure an African American writer and human-rights activist who traveled to the Congo and was horrified by what he saw there the grave mistreatment of the Congolese at the hands of Leopold and his abettors. The Legend of Tarzan isnt a history lesson and isnt pretending to be. But the presence of Jackson as Williams is crucial to the movies tone Hes an anachronistic Greek chorus sometimes comically awed by the vine-swinging and other awesome shenanigans his friend gets up to and other times bearing witness to events that even though theyre fictionalized elements of a summer entertainment still point to unquestionably inhumane horrors. Jackson always funny and sharp isnt just the white guys sidekick; hes our guide into this particular white guys weird world. More often than not his expression reads ""Can you believe what youre seeing?"" Because more often than not we cant. Skarsgards Tarzan with his muscles and Fabio-style tresses is designed to look unreal and he does some very unreal things. Hes the epitome of the strong silent type and Skarsgard plays this angle perfectly partly as a sly joke and partly as a way of getting us to watch and listen. In one of the movies most striking scenes he and Williams cross a ridge to see a pride of lions before them. Scary right? But Clayton--or rather Tarzan--approaches them boldly and suddenly it becomes clear that he knows them from his former life He greets them with the nuzzling face-rub familiar to anyone who has housecats and they return his solemn affection. This is a ridiculous sight. Its also weird and beautiful and daring--you have to laugh a little at its audaciousness but its so completely irony-free that to deride it would only be cheap. Why not just enter its CGI-heavy bubble of wonder? The plot of The Legend of Tarzan is overcomplicated--the movie trips over itself in the last third especially. But theres always something to look at and theres always something or someone in motion. Skarsgards physicality in this role is key. Leaping and swinging and not saying much his Tarzan is like an actor conjuring a sense memory an intuitive sense of how things ought to be The jungle is a rough place but unlike animals men shouldnt kill other men--they know better. Skarsgard speaks through his eyes and his gait. No wonder he can communicate not just with lions but with elephants too He reads their language spoken through soulful eyes and flaring ears the way other more boring cultured white dudes read French. And what about Robbies Jane the daughter of an American schoolteacher a woman who seems very much at home surrounded by the wonders of the jungle? In flashback we see how she and Tarzan meet when he saves her from certain death at the hands of an angry ape. But mostly she saves herself Jane is frequently endangered in The Legend of Tarzan but as Robbie plays her shes so hardy that you dont worry about her for a second. If need be she can even outswim angry hippos. You can see why Tarzan falls for her. At their initial meeting--shes the first human woman hes ever seen a vision in a fluttery white cotton dress like something out of dreamy Victorian erotica--he sniffs at her confounded. Her scent is like nothing hes ever encountered. Shes entranced by him too though she also keeps him from going too far. Her no means no and he gets that. Eventually theyll have amazing beautiful jungle sex as well as a partnership in which theyre balanced equals but that comes later. The Legend of Tarzan is true to its roots but it also knows its stepping into dangerous territory The present. Sometimes its a snakepit. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

The action is set in the eighteen-eighties when Belgian colonists led by Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) sought to conquer the Congo and enslave its inhabitants. Great Britains envoy John Clayton III Lord Greystoke formerly known as Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) is informed of the Belgian plot by an American diplomat George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) and they travel together to thwart it. Johns wife Jane (Margot Robbie) the daughter of an American teacher in the Congo joins them and is captured by Rom. Forced to fight once more as Tarzan the man raised by apes displays his deep roots in Congolese society as well as his ability to talk to animals (who end up engaging in the movies most photogenic combat). Meanwhile the urbane George reminds John and viewers of American imperialist and racist depredations of the era. Jane no mere victim is an accomplished fighter but Tarzan inescapably plays the great white savior and his African counterparts are depicted favorably but emptily.

"Legend of Tarzan The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; legend-of-tarzan-the ) Legend of Tarzan The (United States 2016) July 01 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli In 2016 one wonders whether theres a place in cinema for the 104-year old Tarzan. To make the character more relevant to a modern audience screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer along with director David Yates (who helmed the final four Harry Potter movies) have re-imagined Tarzan as a late 19th century superhero while keeping Edgar Rice Burroughs background material intact. The Legend of Tarzan is an original adventure. It is not an origin story although occasional flashback sequences effectively fill in the title characters history. A ripped Alexander Skarsgard plays Tarzan (a.k.a. John Clayton Viscount Greystoke) with a little more intelligence and sophistication than Johnny Weissmuller or Miles OKeefe. Skarsgards interpretation brings brain and brawn to the part. Likewise this movies Jane (Margot Robbie once again using her excellent American accent) is strongly influenced by 21st century sensibilities - shes feisty forthright and definitely not a traditional damsel-in-distress. Samuel L. Jackson plays Tarzans sidekick George Washington Williams pretty much the way he plays most Samuel L. Jackson characters (albeit with a PG-13 neutering factor in place). And Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz portraying bad guy Captain Rom carries over most of his sneering and other evil mannerisms from Spectre. Hes Blofeld of the Jungle. After a prologue that explains why Rom wants to catch Tarzan the movie provides a semi-convincing reason for Viscount Greystoke to leave behind his estate and return to the lands where he grew up. Jane not content to sit around and let her husband have all the fun decides to accompany him. Also along for the ride is the American Williams a representative of President Benjamin Harrison who believes the King of Belgium might be promoting slave labor in the Congo. Soon after their arrival they are ambushed. Jane is captured and Tarzan is nearly killed. He spends the rest of the film chasing after her although she is by no means a model prisoner spitting in Roms face trying to assault him during dinner and running away. Theres an element of subtle brilliance in the screenplay that has nothing to do with the chases fight scenes and animal interaction. The last thing any viewer would want to see in The Legend of Tarzan is another re-interpretation of the feral childs origin story. Weve gone down that road countless times in versions as diverse as a Disney cartoon (1999s Tarzan) and a soft-core porn retelling (1981s Tarzan the Ape Man). The difficulty for a new Tarzan movie however is that the backstory is necessary to establish aspects of the characters and their relationships that we may be unfamiliar with. The Legend of Tarzan solves this conundrum by giving us highlights of the characters history via strategically placed flashbacks. They are seamlessly incorporated into the main narrative and never seem intrusive or awkward. When it comes to recycling heroes of yesteryear The Legend of Tarzan does a considerably better job than 2013s misfire The Lone Ranger. The Tarzan film isnt as obsessed with pyrotechnics and special effects. There are some of both but they arent excessive. The movie is respectful of its source material and takes the characters seriously although theres room for some humor (most of it coming from Samuel L. Jackson who at times seems to be playing the Danny Glover role in lethal weapon - ""Im too old for this shit""). The Legend of Tarzans camerawork includes long unbroken shots where the camera moves to capture the action rather than cutting. Its impossible to tell whether all the vine-swinging comes from stunt doubles or CGI (probably a mixture of both) but its exhilaratingly presented. The creature work is expertly done making it difficult to determine which animals are real (if any) which are animatronic and which are computer creations. The Legend of Tarzan is a lot like The Jungle Book in that respect although in this movie no talking bears start singing. The Legend of Tarzan moves briskly and has the overall feel of one of Burroughs more entertaining stories come to the screen. (It has often been acknowledged that despite Tarzans popularity his pulpy adventures dont represent the height of literary achievement.) The film is nicely positioned so that if it does well at the box office it could spin off a sequel with little difficulty. More importantly if the reception is tepid it stands well on its own needing no second installment to validate its existence. Unlike so many of the bloated disappointing entries into the 2016 big budget sweepstakes this is good escapist entertainment.

Very very carefully. In David Yatess The Legend of Tarzan the ape-raised athlete no longer represents innate Caucasian dominance the cavalier supremacy that had him introduce himself to Jane as ""the killer of beasts and many black men."" Swipe left on any Tinder charmer who uses that in his profile. Here Tarzan a.k.a. Lord Greystoke returns home from London with his wife (Margot Robbie) to fight the diamond-hunting Belgian conquistadors who are enslaving his friends in the Congo leashing every local from tribesmen to crocodiles. Yates (who directed the last four Harry Potter films) is cautious about racial politics. To champion freedom he tames the storys original author. (Which coincidentally Steven Spielbergs The BFG also did this week to Roald Dahl.) Edgar Rice Burroughss Tarzan mostly fought dark-skinned cannibals and priests. Todays main villain is Christoph Waltzs Flemish captain Leon Rom who wears a bone-colored suit with matching hat. Against the misty forest hes so white he glows. And Alexander Skarsgards blond Tarzan is less a one-man army than a symbol. His biggest act of heroism is inspiring the native Congolese to rise up against the invaders. And I mean all the natives -- the climax belongs to a herd of wildebeest. The screenwriters have also stitched in real-life black activist George Washington Williams an American who sailed to Africa to condemn King Leopold II. Since Williams is not in the books theyve pumped him up as a sharpshooting badass played by of course Samuel L. Jackson. Theres an itch to make this Tarzan a corrective a vengeful Congo Unchained that reteams Jackson and Waltz. Yates mines Zirconium Tarantino even letting Jackson cackle while blasting an antique machine gun. He cant go much further with a PG-13 family flick. The studio certainly wouldnt approve of showing kiddies how the actual Leon Rom fenced off his flower garden with severed heads. So Yates shades the color dynamics by having Williams admit that back in the States his military brigade massacred the Native Americans. Concedes Williams ""Im no better than the Belgians."" And Yates keeps smudging the line leaving us wondering how much to unpack visuals like a white-painted ape-killing Congolese tribe facing off against grieving black gorillas. At this point the Europeans have fled the scene as if to say ""Hey man dont blame us for everything."" Warner Bros.Skarsgard swings quietly through the center of chaos. His Tarzan has somehow acquired a posh British accent but prefers to communicate with fists and flashbacks. Hes all mute eyes and swollen deltoids. (The film cant wait to get Skarsgard out of his shirt.) The charming Robbie handles most of the chatter and spits when Rom expects her to scream like a girl. ""Like a damsel?"" she sneers. That cheek cant erase the ""me savior you babe"" action-flick tropes that 48 earlier Tarzan movies scribbled on our culture. But its fascinating to watch Yates try to honor the character while liberating him from his own nonsense. Yes we still hear that infamous Tarzan yodel -- the song of a choking opera soprano -- but Skarsgard never has to unlock his jaw and let it rip. Instead were standing miles away with the scoundrels as it echoes from the trees. If were honest maybe the world is still by their side. Our spirits soar when Tarzan bests the vile Rom. But the Belgians dominated the Congo for another 70 years and left scars. As much as I enjoyed this bizarre ambitious adventure and its careful popcorn kitsch Tarzans story will always leave our ears ringing with something we hate whether you choose Burroughss white-savior syndrome or Christoph Waltzs shivery final speech ""The future belongs to me.""

The staging isnat inept but individual shots seem truncated the action pared down to its unoriginal essence. 130 Shares Share 126 Tweet 0 Share 4 Share Email Print Share Photo Warner Brothers Why do filmmakers always louse up Tarzan? The 1914 Edgar Rice Burroughs book has a sensational first half before the inevitable Victorian-Edwardian-era corniness and cultural supremacy kick in. Raised by apes the child of shipwrecked English aristocrats doesnt turn out a dearie like Mowgli in The Jungle Book but a badass killer who swings soundlessly through trees and drops nooses on his foes (human and animal). He also finds his dead parents treehouse (still with their skeletons) and teaches himself to read (though he has no idea how the words actually sound -- or that the skeletons are his parents). The old Johnny Weissmuller pictures dumbed Tarzan down but he and Maureen OSullivan looked scrumptious in their skimpy loincloths (at least before the Hayes Office came along and covered them up). Fifty years later Robert Towne wrote a script that honored its source but it was so mucked-up by English director Hugh Hudson that Towne gave the credit to his dog. The new Tarzan film The Legend of Tarzan plays as if a dog ate part of the script. It opens with Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan -- neA John Clayton Lord of Greystoke -- back in his baronial English manse where hes ""hybridizing coconuts"" with no intention of returning to the Belgian Congo. His splendid backstory meanwhile is sprinkled through the action in brief hazy flashbacks so the whole thing feels like a sequel to a movie that was never made. So damn frustrating Why does Clayton go back to Africa? It takes a lot of setup. If I followed it correctly a tribal chief will hand over a load of diamonds that Belgium needs to finance its burgeoning slave trade in return for Tarzan who committed some unspecified-until-later offense against him. Its the job of the Belgian kings nefarious envoy (Christoph Waltz) to lure Clayton back under false pretenses and his unwitting accomplice in that task is George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) who comes to Clayton for help compiling evidence that the king is indeed enslaving the indigenous population. Claytons wife Jane (Margot Robbie) insists on coming along because thats what Jane does. Shes plucky that way. Director David Yates did a yeoman job with the last few Harry Potter installments and made the fine British mini-series State of Play. (The American movie adaptation was negligible.) But either he has no interest in the African landscape or else the studio pared away the connective tissue leaving nothing but formula dreck. The Legend of Tarzan feels as if it wants to be longer to breathe a little and get down. The staging isnt inept but individual shots seem truncated the action pared down to its unoriginal essence. As it stands the CG apes are impressive the elephants (I dont know if theyre CG) magnificent and a short scene in which a pair of lions nuzzle Clayton absolutely lovely. The humans could have used some help. No thats not fair.A Skarsgard could have made an excellent Clayton/Tarzan under different circumstances. He has the right combination of refined features and a rangy body that looks at home in the treetops. I dont think its his fault that he cant get a rhythm going and ends up looking like a paler Viggo Mortensen. Among the movies innumerable disappointments is that it takes an hour for him to remove his shirt (he never takes off his trousers) while Robbie is fully clothed from first to last. Wouldnt those trousers constrict Tarzans vine-swinging? Wouldnt Jane be more comfortable in a pair of jungle shorts? Sorry to be superficial but you miss at least half the fun in a Tarzan movie without bare limbs. Perhaps the thinking was that a half-naked Jane would be too predictably sexist. Oh P.C. where is thy shame? And whos kidding whom? Taken prisoner halfway through Jane sassily asks the villain whether he expects her to ""scream like a damsel."" A disarming line -- except the screenwriters are covering their asses. She stays tied up for most of the movie. The filmmakers do make sure to keep the materials inherent racism in check. Individual Africans males are allowed to shine in action sequences and Jackson is imperturbably Jackson -- modern wisecracking and anti-colonialist. His character has a backstory He once stood by while Native Americans were slaughtered. He will not be so wimpish again. He will even get hold of a machine gun and blast his enemies to kingdom come. He will fight the power. That power includes the Church at least implicitly. Waltzs hammy baddy swings a necklace with a crucifix on the end that turns out to be a most effective garrote. The Legend of Tarzan touches all the liberal bases clumsily. By the way the onscreen title has a little ""R"" next to it denoting a trademark. Thats very strange. Id figured that the character of Tarzan -- having first appeared in a 1912 short story -- was by now in the public domain. Did Warner Bros. execute a deft colonialist move and snatch it away from less-wealthy competitors? The Legend of Tarzan is unlikely to spawn imitators. This commercial vine is likely to snap and The Jungle Book has the monkey-man franchise sewn up.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 01 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 01 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by David Yates Written by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer Starring Alexander Skarsgard Margot Robbie Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz Classification PG Country USA Language English Look up way up its the new improved Tarzan Watch him swinging from vine to vine the king of the jungle the lord of the apes buff smart and ethical dodging political critiques and ducking cultural sensitivities as he rescues Africa herself. Its a fascinating act. Too bad The Legend of Tarzan isnt a better movie. There seems little reason to resurrect Tarzan in 2016; his character or at least his creator the turn-of-the-century American schlockmeister Edgar Rice Burroughs is racist and sexist by any contemporary standard. Titillating audiences with his wild side while reassuring them of his essential European civility Tarzan in all his many incarnations was always just an unkempt version of the mighty whitey. Jane the African natives and even his simian family were little more than props in his triumphant story. Heck lets call the guy a species-ist too.Apart from Disney animated features that originated back in the 1990s no movie studio has touched the story in this century. The last adult versions - an erotic B-movie starring Bo Derek as Jane; an unsuccessful attempt to elevate the story as Greystoke - date to the 1980s when the notion that the white patriarchy is not necessarily heroic had not fully migrated from academia to popular culture.So in the 21st century Tarzan looks like a cultural controversy just waiting to happen. But he is also next to Sherlock Holmes and Wonderlands Alice one of the most famous literary characters ever penned and since contemporary Hollywood can never be convinced that audiences are interested in characters they havent previously met Warner Bros. is willing to risk it.Enter screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer with a script in which the genteel John Clayton Viscount Greystoke must come out of his retirement on his English estate tear off his shirt and return to Africa to rescue his Congolese friends and his wife Jane from Belgian slave traders.Does this sound like a movie suffering from a white-saviour complex?No worries Tarzans initial goad and eventual sidekick is one George Washington Williams an American ambassador and Civil War veteran determined to prove that the Belgian King Leopold is running a slave trade to pay for his Congolese colony. Hes black.Or does it also sound like a movie that casts Jane as a retrograde damsel in distress? No worries she rejects that very title as she spits in her captors face and escapes into the jungle herself. Shes quickly recaptured and Tarzan does have to rescue her in the end but you cant have everything in plotting Cozad and Brewer have done a rather clever job of dodging all the obvious pitfalls that might trip up the new Tarzan as he swings his way to another victory.Their dialogue on the other hand is lamentable. ""The last thing you need is more stress"" Lord Greystoke tells his lady as he attempts to dissuade her from following him to the Congo as though she were some working mom proposing to coach the T-ball team. And on it goes with clunky modern phrases and painfully obvious exposition marring scene after scene.If Cozad and Brewer have figured out a good story they have not determined a tone in which to tell it and director David Yates (who did the last four Harry Potter movies) cant help them. There is lots of engrossing action and glorious scenery here as Tarzan battles with gorillas attacks a train full of chained slaves or leads a herd of stampeding water buffalo but whenever theres dialogue Yates waffles between an earnestness that his outlandish story doesnt justify and a snappy humour that his cast doesnt deliver.Margot Robbies Jane in particular is excruciating the character is supposed to be a feisty wit coming back at her evil captor with crushing one-liners but a flat Robbie muffs the delivery of practically every joke giving Christoph Waltzs Belgian baddie nothing to perform against. In any case that character is just a watered-down repeat of Waltzs increasingly familiar evil European from such films as Inglourious Basterds and Spectre. You can almost hear Yates saying to the actor ""Give me Hans Landa at 75 per cent.""As Williams Samuel L. Jackson is also reprising a familiar type the righteous racial avenger that he has created for Quentin Tarantino in particular - with much less interesting back story or opportunity to charm. Saddled with a superficial character the actor can only offer a superficial performance.Like a cat poised to pounce the Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgard produces a sensitively quiet Tarzan who is often quite effective as he warily eyes European colonialists tribal foes and the pulsating jungle itself. Skarsgard even masters one of the few successful jokes in the script with a wise bit of deadpan; when initially asked why he doesnt want to return to Africa Tarzan replies flatly ""Its hot."" But when he and Williams start discussing whether Williams threatened by a vicious gorilla was going to ""lick his nuts"" to show subservience you wonder how Yates and his screenwriters could be so tone-deaf.Theres no jocular rapport established between the men elsewhere and a lot more wittier humour would certainly not go amiss as the fantastical history piles up no audience can be counted on to know much about King Leopolds rape of his private colony but presumably the Congo wasnt rescued by an ululating Englishman in a loincloth. Indeed to justify its silly plot this Tarzan desperately needs the kind of light comic touch that made all those Indiana Jones stories about historic treasures and marauding Nazis amusing rather than stupid.Theres also not much chemistry between Skarsgard and Robbie in a film that hints at the Greystokes great sex life but barely shows it. Instead we get flashes of flesh that are hilariously dated in their obviousness. Theres Jane in a rain storm with her wet clothes clinging to her body. Theres Tarzan tearing off his shirt to reveal a strategically positioned waistband because apparently Victorian adventurers favoured low-rise trousers. One thing that can be said for this erratic attempt to reinvent Tarzan for the 21st century however is that it does at least feature equal-opportunity ogling.

Entertainment shows Alexander Skarsgard from ""The Legend of Tarzan.""(Photo Jonathan Olley Associated Press)""The Legend of Tarzan"" is an earnest well-meaning take on the Lord of the Apes the King of the Jungle. Anyone secretly hoping for a campy tale of a man in a loincloth will be disappointed.At the same time this ""Tarzan"" takes itself a little too seriously its good intentions trumping its instincts to excite and entertain. This is ""Tarzan"" after all as much as director David Yates (who helmed four ""Harry Potter"" movies) tries to dress it up like an ""Out of Africa""-style prestige picture.Still no one embarrasses themselves in what could be a disaster. Alexander Skarsgard (""True Blood"") stars as the T-man and certainly has the chiseled chest required to spend 90 percent of the film shirtless. But hes sleepy and almost charisma-free as if every time he was about to crack a smile Yates slipped him a note that said ""be serious.""The film picks up with Tarzan out of the jungle telling the story of how he was raised by apes mostly in flashback. (The film wisely assumes the audience already knows the Tarzan tale.) Along with his wife Jane (Margot Robbie doing her best to be more than a damsel in distress) Tarzan is lured back home to stop an evil diamond plunderer (smarm expert Christoph Waltz) from enslaving and slaughtering a race of people. Samuel L. Jackson tags along as a Civil War vet on Tarzans side.Tarzan can speak to elephants by looking into their eyes and can take out an entire train car full of soldiers like Steven Seagal. Hes a lover and a fighter. The movie doesnt get to have it both ways; despite its impressive visual sweep its more formal than fun. ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is no jungle boogie but its a decent swing.agrahamdetroitnews.com(313) 222-2284twitter.com/grahamoramaThe Legend of TarzanGRADE B-Rated PG-13 for sequences of action and violence some sensuality and brief rude dialogueRunning time 110 minutes 27 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/294DK0A MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/07/01/review-legend-tarzan-goes-serious-route/86573342/,200,thelegendoftarzan7,thelegendoftarzan,detroitnews

(Warner Bros.)GALLERY Stuck in time Margot Robbie as Jane and Alexander Skarsgard... (Warner Bros. )By Molly Eichel Staff WriterPosted July 02 2016How do you solve a problem like Tarzan? In the updated version The Legend of Tarzan the Lord of the Jungle gets a feminist Jane and an African-American sidekick. But is that enough to make Edgar Rice Burroughs story feel like its not firmly planted in a bygone century?True Bloods Alexander SkarsgAY=rd takes on the role this time and in a way hes perfect for it. The Swede is muscled lean and blond and spends a lot of time look plaintive. The famed Jane is played by Margot Robbie an actress who is so full of onscreen vivaciousness that her characters newfound independence is a perfect fit. Unlike a lot of reboots The Legend of Tarzan opts to tell a new tale rather than revert to the origin story. We meet John Clayton Lord Greystoke after hes met Jane and returned to his supposed homeland in England. His English is perfect and he wears those great Victorian dusters but his hands give him away. After learning to walk on all fours his bone structure has changed. Hes brought back to the Congo under the guise of a diplomatic mission. King Leopold II of Belgium is colonizing Claytons former haunt and he wants the British to be a part of it. But thats all a ruse. Leopolds right-hand man LA(c)on Rom (Christoph Waltz returning to well-worn territory as the slick chatty villain) covets a stash of diamonds guarded by a fierce tribe whose chief (Djimon Hounsou) wants Tarzan dead. Roms plan is to deliver Clayton in exchange for the bounty. David Yates ( Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows) and his screenwriters Craig Brewer ( Hustle amp; Flow Black Snake Moan) and Adam Cozad try desperately to update Tarzan for 2016. Jane gains agency Even as Clayton is reluctant to return to Africa shes raring to go. Shes sick of corseted life in England. And theres the addition of a real-life black human-rights activist George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) who ultimately convinces Clayton to head back to Africa to expose King Leopolds enslavement of the native people. Jackson tries his darndest and he was a big hit at the screening I went to. (He often adds much-needed comic relief). But Tarzan is still a story of a white man who has dominion over not just animals but also Africans and it feels . . . icky. Kudos for trying and all. Case in point The real Williams went to the Congo and was disgusted by Leopolds use of slaves prompting him to write an open letter to the Belgian monarch. Thats pretty awesome. But The Legend of Tarzan co-opts his defiance with a white guy getting some of the credit. The same good intentions are applied to Jane. While its great that Brewer and Cozad try to embolden her shes still a damsel in distress in many ways. She even points this out before spitting in the face of Rom her captor. But that doesnt make it any less true. And a lot of her worth is placed on having a baby. On a movie level The Legend of Tarzan has its moments - and not just because SkarsgAY=rd is pretty to look at (although lets not mince words - that helps). The set pieces are fun if not as spectacular as those in Jon Favreaus adaptation of Kiplings similar The Jungle Book. And the plot moves at a nice pace. But maybe next time instead of retelling the legend of Tarzan Hollywood tells The Legend of George Washington Williams.meichelphillynews.com215-854-5909mollyeichel MOVIE REVIEW The Legend of Tarzan (Out of four stars) y Directed by David Yates.

Privacy Policy or The vine-swinging character of Tarzan first appeared on the silver screen nearly 100 years ago in 1918. Which is perhaps why this 2016 reboot ""The Legend of Tarzan"" feels woefully out of touch. Theres only so much updating that can be done to an Edgar Rice Burroughs tale about an Englishman raised in the African jungles by gorillas a wild man who communes with animals. And who exactly was clamoring for a reboot of this property?Writers Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer have decided that the way to bring Tarzan into a contemporary sensibility is to stuff his story inside a bizarre revisionist history fantasy where the native African Congolese tribes overthrow the exploitative Belgian colonialists. It allows Tarzan a symbol of white cultural appropriation to battle evil colonial exploiters who would press the Congolese into slavery to further their empire. While it might make us feel better about Tarzans role in the jungle for a few escapist hours dont think for a second that King Leopold II of Belgium didnt get away with pillaging the land and its people. Its a pleasant idea but strangely naive in the way it rewrites history.Enormous Swede Alexander Skarsgard doffs his shirt as the titular Tarzan aka Lord Greystoke John Clayton III. The role has always required more physical than performance qualities (Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller is perhaps the most famous Tarzan from the 1930s and 40s) and Skarsgard fits the bill -- lanky and muscled so outrageously that he walks stiffly. But hes incredibly boring in this role. Theres no fire in his eyes no wild abandon no rakish sexiness.Fortunately hes surrounded by Margot Robbie as his feisty wife Jane and Samuel L. Jackson as an American Civil War vet George Washington Williams who has some stake in uncovering Leopolds secret slave labor. Jackson does his usual routine but its so welcome against the dour glowering of Skarsgard who barely speaks possibly due to his wonky British accent.Leopold never appears in the film with the villainy duties taken over by the meticulously menacing Austrian actor Christoph Waltz as his proxy Leon Rom. He strikes a deal with Djimon Honsous vengeful Chief Mbonga to trade Tarzan for diamonds in order to make payments on Belgiums defaulted loans. Loans and diamonds and gorillas and wildebeests oh myThe film directed by ""Harry Potter"" helmer David Yates is stunningly shot all sweeping vistas and spectacular combat but the pacing of it feels so so off. It seems as if it was hurriedly re-edited until the last minute chopped haphazardly into mince-meat cutting between flashbacks of Tarzans experiences in the jungle as a child which are mostly unnecessary and the main storyline which is rushed and underdeveloped. The timing of some of the events can be confusing as well as other simple facts. Who named him Tarzan anyway? How did he figure out his family lineage?This legend of Tarzan is and always has been about a white savior figure and no amount of politically correct representational politics can change that fact. Ultimately this film feels both misguided and slapdash and the good parts -- impressive CGI gorillas Jacksons humor Robbies sass or even Skarsgards abs -- arent enough to muddle through this overly complicated and dull-as-dirt story.THE LEGEND OF TARZAN2 out of 4 starsCast Alexander Skarsgard Margot Robbie Samuel L.

But hes got a knack for conveying the grandeur of Africa the fierce power of the animals the currents of straightforward emotion (love rage hate grief etc.) and the thrill of nature (human and otherwise) unleashed. 2016. -- Matthew Lickona Showtimes AMC Fashion Valley 7037 Friars Road San Diego 888-262-4386 | Directions Saturday July 30 125pm 415pm Sunday July 31 1035am 125pm 415pm Monday August 1 1035am 125pm 415pm Tuesday August 2 1035am 125pm 415pm Wednesday August 3 1035am 125pm 415pm AMC Mission Valley 1640 Camino del Rio North San Diego 888-262-4386 | Directions Saturday July 30 810pm 1050pm Sunday July 31 755pm 1030pm Monday August 1 1140am 830pm Tuesday August 2 1140am 830pm Wednesday August 3 1140am AMC Palm Promenade 770 Dennery Road Chula Vista 888-262-4386 | Directions Saturday July 30 805pm 1055pm Sunday July 31 1125am 805pm 1055pm Monday August 1 1125am 730pm 1010pm Tuesday August 2 1125am 730pm 1010pm Wednesday August 3 1125am 730pm 1010pm AMC Plaza Bonita 3050 Plaza Bonita Road National City 888-262-4386 | Directions Saturday July 30 145pm 715pm Sunday July 31 1100am 145pm 715pm Monday August 1 1040am 400pm 920pm Tuesday August 2 1040am 400pm 920pm Wednesday August 3 1040am 400pm 920pm Angelika Film Center 11620 Carmel Mountain Road San Diego 858-674-6164 | Directions Saturday July 30 1030pm Sunday July 31 1000am 1030pm Monday August 1 1000am 1030pm Tuesday August 2 1000am 1030pm Wednesday August 3 1000am 1030pm Thursday August 4 1000am 1030pm Edwards Mira Mesa 10733 Westview Parkway San Diego 858-635-7716 | Directions Saturday July 30 1255pm 340pm 640pm 935pm Sunday July 31 1020am 1255pm 340pm 640pm 935pm Monday August 1 1250pm 340pm 645pm 935pm Tuesday August 2 100pm 340pm 645pm 935pm Wednesday August 3 100pm 340pm 645pm 935pm Thursday August 4 100pm 340pm 645pm 935pm Krikorian Vista Village 25 Main Street Vista 760-945-7469 | Directions Saturday July 30 220pm 455pm 730pm 1010pm Sunday July 31 1140am 220pm 455pm 730pm 1010pm Monday August 1 1140am 220pm 455pm 730pm 1010pm Tuesday August 2 1140am 220pm 455pm 730pm 1010pm Wednesday August 3 1140am 220pm 455pm 730pm 1010pm Regal Carlsbad 12 2501 El Camino Real Carlsbad 844-462-7342 | Directions Saturday July 30 130pm 415pm 745pm 1030pm Sunday July 31 1045am 130pm 415pm 745pm 1030pm Monday August 1 1045am 130pm 415pm 745pm 1030pm Tuesday August 2 1045am 130pm 415pm 745pm 1030pm Wednesday August 3 1045am 130pm 415pm 745pm 1030pm Thursday August 4 1045am 130pm 415pm Regal Escondido 350 West Valley Parkway Escondido 760-291-0119 | Directions Saturday July 30 140pm 430pm 720pm 1020pm Sunday July 31 140pm 430pm 720pm 1020pm Monday August 1 140pm 430pm 720pm 1020pm Tuesday August 2 140pm 430pm 720pm 1020pm Wednesday August 3 140pm 430pm 720pm 1020pm Thursday August 4 140pm 735pm Regal Oceanside 401 Mission Avenue Oceanside 760-439-1327 | Directions Saturday July 30 110pm 410pm 725pm 1005pm Sunday July 31 110pm 410pm 725pm 1005pm Monday August 1 110pm 410pm 725pm 1005pm Tuesday August 2 110pm 410pm 725pm 1005pm Wednesday August 3 110pm 410pm 725pm 1005pm Thursday August 4 110pm 410pm Regal Parkway Plaza 405 Parkway Plaza El Cajon 619-401-3456 | Directions Saturday July 30 120pm 420pm 720pm 1020pm Sunday July 31 1020am 120pm 420pm 720pm 1020pm Monday August 1 1020am 120pm 420pm 720pm 1020pm Tuesday August 2 120pm 420pm 720pm 1020pm Wednesday August 3 120pm 420pm 720pm 1020pm Thursday August 4 1020am 120pm 420pm 720pm 1020pm Regal Rancho del Rey 1025 Tierra del Rey Chula Vista 619-216-4707 | Directions Saturday July 30 1205pm 305pm 610pm 910pm Sunday July 31 1205pm 305pm 610pm 910pm Monday August 1 1205pm 305pm 610pm 910pm Tuesday August 2 1205pm 305pm 610pm 910pm Wednesday August 3 1205pm 305pm 610pm 910pm Thursday August 4 1205pm 305pm 610pm 910pm Regal Rancho San Diego 2951 Jamacha Road El Cajon 619-660-3483 | Directions Saturday July 30 435pm 1005pm Sunday July 31 1055am 435pm 1005pm Monday August 1 1100am 435pm 1005pm Tuesday August 2 1100am 435pm 1005pm Wednesday August 3 1100am 435pm 1005pm Thursday August 4 1100am 435pm Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Comments Sign in to comment Username I have an account.

On the one hand its easy to see why Tarzan has yet again swung back into our lives Tarzan and Hollywood were born almost simultaneously like conjoined twins of a new pop-culture machine. The first ""Tarzan"" silent came just a few years after Edgar Rice Burroughs initial novel. More than 50 films have followed. But as time has gone on Tarzan has ceded his mass-market turf to a new set of brawny questionably attired do-gooders who swing not from vines but webs and grappling hooks. Monkey Men are out; Batmen are in. Tarzans relevance has also drifted. He was originally conceived as a pulpy fable for a society feeling nostalgic for nature as it watched Model Ts roll off assembly lines. Burroughs tale coincided with the National Parks movement and the creation of the Boy Scouts. So if properly outfitted for todays back-to-the-land trends Tarzan probably should be a thinner bearded man who can brew a hoppy IPA and lives off-the-grid in Brooklyn coffee shops. Can such a vestige of imperial-era imaginations - one dreamed up by a man who never set foot in Africa - be updated to today? ""The Legend of Tarzan"" suggests not and the films main source of suspense is watching it twist and contort a century-old property into something meaningful. Craig Brewer and Adam Cozads script sets the tale a decade after the discovery of Tarzan in West Africa; seen only in flashback is Tarzans origin story including a more violent version of his famously loquacious introduction to Jane. Tarzan or John Clayton III (Alexander Skarsgard) is living in London with his wife Jane (Margot Robbie). The jungle is far behind him hes a Lord polished and serious but still with ape-like hands that would impress even Donald Trump. Hes coaxed back to Africa by George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) an American and veteran of the Civil War who seeks to uncover what he believes is Belgiums introduction of slavery to the Congo. The character loosely based on a real historical figure is the most intriguing if awkward addition. A better more realistic movie could have been made about him. In the Congo is Belgiums envoy Capt. Leon Rom a linen-suited hunter of diamonds to fill Leopolds coffers. For this symbol of refinement and menace the filmmakers naturally turn to Christoph Waltz. The simplistic historical backdrop of late 19th century Congo here is more cartoonish than even Tarzan himself. But the atmosphere is richly exotic full of majestic vistas and vivid close-ups. Filming largely on sound stages Yates veteran of later ""Harry Potter"" films has firm control of the films lushly romantic imagery. You feel that Bogie and Bacall could drift down the river at any moment. But the film searching for a purpose and some drama doesnt deserve the grandeur Yates gives it. Tarzan played with sufficient muscle and smarts by Skarsgard leads an uprising through his ability to communicate with animals and the (largely faceless) natives. Hes a Jungle Jesus returned to fight colonial incursion and among the more ridiculous white saviors youre likely to see. The wildlife is also comically over stimulated. The CGI gorillas appear like Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons on steroids. Effort has been made to make Jane more than a damsel in distress which she literally denies being at one point. The scene-stealing Robbie breaks though the roles stereotypes even while still being mired in them. Agility is the prime trait of Tarzan but ""Legend"" has little of it. The film strains to juggle the characters baggage instead of embracing the tales innate silliness and spirit of adventure. (Over the years Tarzan fought dinosaurs and Roman gladiators.) That this is merely another naked attempt to profit from a well-known property is visible even in the films title. There not even hidden by a loin cloth is a little trademark symbol next to ""Tarzan"" King of the Franchise. ""The Legend of Tarzan"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""sequences of action and violence some sensuality and brief rude dialogue.""

"Alexander Skarsgard is excellent in the otherwise awkward The Legend of Tarzan - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Alexander Skarsgard is excellent in the otherwise awkward The Legend of Tarzan The Legend of Tarzan movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews The Legend of Tarzan starring Alexander Skarsgard Margot Robbie Samuel L. Jackson Christoph Waltz Djimon Hounsou Jim Broadbent. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews The Legend of Tarzan starring Alexander Skarsgard Margot Robbie Samuel L. Jackson Christoph Waltz Djimon Hounsou Jim Broadbent. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Like its titular character trying to reconcile being both the fifth Earl of Greystoke and the once and future King of the Jungle ""The Legend of Tarzan"" wants to be both modern and traditional hip and classic. Its a tough balance to strike and this film cant manage it.Which is too bad because actor Alexander Skarsgard the latest iteration of the Edgar Rice Burroughs character filmed dozens of times since Elmo Lincoln donned the loincloth in 1918 turns out to be an exemplary Tarzan. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Its a given in this age of intense training regimens for actors that Skarsgard has the physique for the part looking lean and sinewy enough to actually do the breathtaking vine swinging that is in fact accomplished by a CGI character modeled on a Cirque du Soleil trapeze artist.Even better however is that the actor best known for HBOs ""True Blood"" has the fine-boned features that enable him to project a quite gratifying air of dignity stillness even repose making him the very model of an unflappable jungle monarch. Having David Yates the director of the final four ""Harry Potter"" epics in charge here no doubt helped with this pictures large-scale action sequences.But even his skill and that of ""Potter"" collaborators like production designer Stuart Craig editor Mark Day and visual effects supervisor Tim Burke cant heal this films split personality.As written by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer ""The Legend of Tarzan"" alternates between a brazenly contemporary sensibility and quietly time-honored events. Unfortunately almost all of the former are awkward while the latter still ring true.A few of Cozad and Brewers ideas are interesting like referencing Belgiums King Leopold II whose exploitative personal ownership destroyed the Congo that was the King of the Jungles home. Also this iteration of Tarzan begins some years after the man in question has married Jane (Margot Robbie) and left Africa for London where as John Clayton Lord Greystoke he apparently divides his time between serving in the House of Lords and hybridizing coconuts. The Legend of Tarzan trailer Watch the trailer for ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Watch the trailer for ""The Legend of Tarzan."" See more videos Meanwhile back in Africa we meet King Leopolds worse-than-evil envoy Leon Rom (the always villainous Christoph Waltz) who does things with a rosary the church never taught and has made a devils bargain with Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou) chief of the powerful and sinister Mbolonga tribe.This worthy adversary who controls some fabulously wealthy diamond mines has been nursing a grudge against the erstwhile vine swinger and he tells Rom that if he produces Tarzan he can have all the gems he and Belgiums greedy king desire.John Clayton knowing none of this allows himself to be convinced to return to Africa and when wife Jane demands to go along he takes her with him. Big mistake.All this sounds promising enough for a Saturday matinee movie and in fact the parts of ""The Legend of Tarzan"" that work best are the flashbacks to Tarzans well-known jungle origins and his bonding with the fierce Mangani gorillas he thinks of as family.But this film yearns to be contemporary which means among other things hollow and out of place 21st century dialogue lines like ""how do you want to play this"" and ""tell me something I dont know"" as well as what the MPAA rating guidelines accurately describe as ""brief rude dialogue.""Even less satisfactory Tarzan excepted are the characters who speak this language. Actress Robbie tries hard as Jane but she is too ostentatiously modern and feisty to be at all convincing.Faring even worse is Samuel J. Jackson who plays George Washington Williams a swashbuckling American who convinces John Clayton to take him along when he reveals himself to be a secret anti-slavery crusader.Part comic relief part valued ally Williams is an altogether puzzling script component and Jacksons habit of sounding like he just stepped out of ""Pulp Fiction"" does not help things.One of the most noteworthy aspects of ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is that though it is chock-a-block with jungle animals all of whom seem to know Tarzan personally they are exclusively created via CGI effects. Some of these moments are quite effective but quitting while its ahead is not something thats in this films vocabulary.The Legend of TarzanMPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of action and violence some sensuality and brief rude dialogue.Running time 1 hour 50 minutes.In general release.""The Legend of Tarzan."" Though Alexander Skarsgard is excellent in the title role the rest of the film tries too hard to modernize itself with unhappy results. -- Kenneth Turan Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Margot Robbie Djimon Hounsou The Legend of Tarzan Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-legend-tarzan-review-20160627-snap-story.html,200,thelegendoftarzan13,thelegendoftarzan,latimes

Credit Jonathan Olley By Peter Travers June 29 2016 More News 11 Best Movies of 2016 So Far The Joy of Vampire Sex The Schlocky Sensual Secrets Behind the Success of True Blood How Superhero Movies Became Too Big To Fail All Stories >> Whatever you think of the new screen version of Tarzan and reaction will likely be polarizing  you have to admit that Alexander Skarsgard brings his A-game -- mind heart and body beautiful. He vine-swings across the jungle mostly minus a loincloth but with a lot more on his mind than hooking up with Jane (a spirited sexy Margot Robbie). The Legend of Tarzan is bursting with big ideas animal v human exploration v exploitation primitivism v civilization. Its a heavy thematic load for a single movie to handle -- especially this one which nearly collapses from its burden. But its hard to fault director David Yates who captained the last four Harry Potter movies for having ambition. More News 11 Best Movies of 2016 So Far The Joy of Vampire Sex The Schlocky Sensual Secrets Behind the Success of True Blood How Superhero Movies Became Too Big To Fail All Stories >> Related Summer Movie Preview 2016 Attack of the Blockbuster Clones Superheroes supervillains sequels semi-reboots -- the scoop on the seasons surprisingly familiar multiplex stunners The script by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer keeps jamming things in. On first meeting Tarzan is not Tarzan -- hes John Clayton III the fifth earl of Greystoke a 1880s British gentleman down to his manicured fingertips. In flashbacks were reminded of his backstory as an orphan raised by apes in Africa. But Yates first shows us the lord of the manner who has put his Tarzan days behind him for 10 years and is now settled down with wife Jane. Its duty that calls. Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz oozing menace) the envoy to the King of Belgium tricks him back to the Congo on a humanitarian mission. Jane goes along as does ex-American soldier George Washington Williams (Samuel l. Jackson) who smells a rat involving slave traders diamond thieves and a revenge plot against Tarzan. Too much? You bet especially when the whole shebang degenerates into a chase to find Jane. Its one thing to add a contemporary spin to material that Edgar Rice Burroughs cooked up a century ago  but Jackson is pure Pulp Fiction. And Jane is every inch the modern American woman ready to crotch drop Rom for holding her captive as a plot to get Tarzan in his clutches. The character has figured in over 200 films and TV shows from Johnny Weismullers jungle adventures in the 1930s to the Disney animated feature; the closest ancestor to this latest version would be Hugh Hudsons tony 1984 take Greystoke. Skarsgard effectively shows the struggle of a man caught between two worlds. Are you jarred by some of the anachronistic acting? Troubled that the animals are all digital? Pissed that youve seen it all before? At least its watchable. In summer baby thats high praise. Topics Margot Robbie Christoph Waltz Samuel L.

Comments The Legend of Tarzan 3D Video Rated PG-13  110 minutes  2016 Tarzan is one of the most widely known and frequently iterated characters in modern media history having been the subject of more than 30 books 50 films and various other entertainments since his creation by writer Edgar Rice Burroughs over a century ago. Elmo Lincoln was the first actor to portray Tarzan in three silent films as a kind of eroticized white native in a headband; later Johnny Weissmuller who donned Tarzans loincloth in 12 films throughout the 1930s and 1940s made chiseled abs white-god status over African tribes and the undulating ""Tarzan yell"" part of the characters cinematic signature.

Jackson left and Alexander Skarsgard in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Credit Jonathan Olley/Warner Bros. ""The Legend of Tarzan"" has a whole lot of fun big-screen things going for it -- adventure romance natural landscapes digital animals and oceans of rippling handsome man-muscle. Its sweep and easy pleasures come from its old-fashioned escapades -- its one long dash through the jungle by foot train boat and swinging vine -- but what makes it more enjoyable than other recycled stories of this type is that the filmmakers have given Tarzan a thoughtful imperfect makeover. That must have been tough given the origin storys white supremacy problems. Video Movie Review The Legend of Tarzan The Times critic Manohla Dargis reviews ""The Legend of Tarzan."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date June 30 2016. Photo by Jonathan Olley/Warner Brothers. Tarzan has always had bad optics -- white hero black land -- to state the excessively obvious. Probably the only real way to avoid his negative image would be to let him molder on the shelf and in our cultural memory. Except that this wild child raised by apes turned wild man forever caught between civilization and nature is a great mythic character -- a rich dense tangle of narrative philosophical and political meanings. That partly explains why hes been such a commercially reliable property since Edgar Rice Burroughs cut him loose in 1912 the year Tarzan roared into existence in a pulp magazine that evolved into an empire of books comics plays and films. Video Trailer The Legend Of Tarzan A man who grew up in the wild jungle and has resettled into civilization is sent on a mission into Congo unaware that he is a pawn in a deadly convergence of greed and revenge. By WARNER BROS. PICTURES on Publish Date December 12 2015. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed The image of Alexander Skarsgard crashing bare-chested through the jungle as the latest big-screen Tarzan his long hair and diamond-cut muscles gently fluttering gets at another aspect of this characters attraction. Like a lot of Tarzan stories this one teems with striking flora and fauna much of it skillfully computer generated some of it captured on location in green green Gabon. But its most special and spectacular effect is Tarzan one of those characters who have always complicated the familiar argument that visual pleasure in Hollywood cinema is hinged on women being objects of male desire. Johnny Weissmuller the most famous screen Tarzan was an exemplary fetishized object of desire. Photo Alexander Skarsgard in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Credit Warner Bros. The casting of Mr. Skarsgard who spent a lot of time baring his body along with vampire fangs on the HBO show ""True Blood"" indicates that the filmmakers understand a primal part of Tarzans allure. This isnt strictly a question of Mr. Skarsgards considerable physical charms though these are central to the character. (He isnt playing nerd boy of the jungle.) Mr. Skarsgard is also a fine actor with an enigmatic melancholy a quality that has been put to expressive use in small roles in movies like ""What Maisie Knew"" and that here suggests Tarzan carries a profound burden that makes him more complex than the usual beefcake in loincloth. Photo Christoph Waltz in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Credit Warner Bros. And Tarzan needs a burden something heavy enough to justify the exhumation of such a difficult fantasy figure. He gets one by proxy in ""The Legend of Tarzan"" which opens with some historically informed text about King Leopold II of Belgium (1835-1909) known as the butcher of Congo for his role in murdering millions. Its a grim start to this make-believe but the mood lifts at Greystoke Manor Tarzans ancestral pad in Britain where hes broodily prowling about like a caged animal. Already married to Lady Jane (Margot Robbie holding her own) Tarzan now goes by John Clayton having years earlier returned to nominal civilization and its discontents. Photo Margot Robbie in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Credit Warner Bros. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Directed by David Yates from an action-and-incident-packed script by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer ""The Legend of Tarzan"" takes a while to get going. After announcing its grave bona fides it continues to engage in a lot of narrative throat clearing much of it dedicated to seeding Burroughss foundational story with historical facts. To this end John receives an invitation from King Leopold to return to Congo to witness the kings putative good works. John rejects the offer only to change his mind after an entreaty from an American George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) who suspects that the Belgian king is enslaving the regions people. Photo Alexander Skarsgard left and Samuel L. Jackson in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Credit Warner Bros. Mr. Jacksons character is very loosely based on an extraordinary real historical hero named George Washington Williams who occupies a chapter in Adam Hochschilds magisterial book ""King Leopolds Ghost A Story of Greed Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa."" Mr. Hochschild writes that Williams whom he calls ""the first heretic"" was the earliest dissenter to speak out ""fully and passionately and repeatedly"" on Leopolds atrocities. Williams deserves a grand cinematic adventure of his own and perhaps Mr. Jacksons comfortable affable performance which like the movie itself oscillates between seriousness and gentle comedy will help make that case. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Here though Williams is basically an elevated sidekick as well as a physician war veteran and crack shot whos as proficient at suturing wounds with insects as he is mowing down swaths of white mercenaries. More interesting especially given how routine colonialist fantasies tend to play out it is Williams who voices the complexities catastrophic errors and redemptive efforts of the so-called civilized world a screen job usually given to white saviors. Williamss polar opposite is the resident villain Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz predictably good) a silky uncomplicated sadist who embodies rapacious evil from his all-white suit to his crosslike weapon.Tarzan remains the man apart and the man in the middle the uneasy sometimes forlorn sometimes exuberant bridge between civilization and nature between the human and nonhuman animal world. His origin story from his cradle to his new mothers hairy arms is related in flashback patchwork that conveys what he lost when he left the jungle -- home world and identity. And when he at last returns to that home he has much to do including nuzzle old furred friends and lead a rescue mission that soon involves Jane along with thousands of Africans. Jane scoffs at the word damsel but shes in distress as well as a stand-in for the abused captive black bodies that the movie shows only glancingly.Mr. Yates who directed the last four movies in the ""Harry Potter"" franchise slips easily between intimacy and grandiosity and he scales up and scales down as easily as Tarzan scrambles up and down the digitally rendered trees. If he and his team havent reinvented Tarzan its because theyre working in an industrial context that still puts a premium on heroic white men even if this one doesnt make you wince each time he turns up. Tarzan is still the white avatar flying through the African jungle with eerie skills a mighty yodel and existential issues yet the terrain he swings over is messier closer and less of a lie than it once was. Part of Tarzans appeal -- at least to some -- is that he inhabits a world that resembles ours but without the unsettling distractions of real suffering. Its become trickier for pop entertainments to gloss over historical traumas which may be why so many modern colonial struggles involve deep space or an alien invasion. Perhaps its easier to rewrite history through futuristic fictions where worlds can collide before everyone moves on. Theres something touching about ""The Legend of Tarzan"" which as it struggles to offer old Hollywood-style adventure without old Hollywood-style racism suggests that perhaps other fantasies are possible -- you just need some thought and Mr. Jackson.""The Legend of Tarzan"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its a Tarzan movie Running time 1 hour 49 minutes. The Legend of Tarzan Director David Yates Writers Adam Cozad Craig Brewer Stars Alexander Skarsgard Rory J.

Photo Warner Bros. Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated June 30 2016 302 p.m. ET 22 COMMENTS I want to report an accident at the intersection of Hollywood and vines. Tarzan that old yodeler has been trapped in a defective vehicle. Dont bring the jaws of life though because ""The Legend of Tarzan"" for all its anticolonialist posturing and eminently attractive co-stars has a dead soul. Tarzan--John Clayton Lord Greystoke if you please--is played by Alexander Skarsgard an appealing actor who has honored his craft by subjecting his body to what must have been brutally rigorous training. The results are impressive when he finally takes off his shirt. But the screenplay a wretched patchwork of flashbacks exposition explanation and recapitulation takes an unconscionably long time to get Tarzan out of England where his default expression is a scowl. After he and his wife Jane (Margot Robbie) return to the jungles of Africa where they once lived he swings on vines sporadically and takes on a digital gorilla in manifestly silly hand-to-paw combat. Jane wears a flowing white gown when she isnt suffering terribly--and sometimes when she is--at the hands of Capt. Leon Rom an evil Belgian played by Christoph Waltz with only intimations of the gleeful malice that has come to be that splendid actors trademark. More Reviews The BFG Read More How The Legend of Tarzan Got Modernized (June 23 2016) Is ""gleeless"" a word? Its a good one to describe this film. The anticolonial content is turgid and perfunctory though it does hint at horrors inflicted by Belgium on the Congo. (To gain favor for King Leopold II and wealth and power for himself Rom tries to lead the hero to slaughter at the hands of a chief whom Tarzan once wronged.) The colors are glum; arent jungles supposed to be bright green? Samuel L. Jackson tries to be pointedly funny as George Washington Williams an American emissary of some sort who comes to Africa with Mr. and Mrs. Tarzan and Rom because he suspects the existence of slavery there. But Williams as written is an appliance--sometimes an observer sometimes a two-gun sidekick never a character with a trace of flesh or blood. Tarzan Swings Through Screens A History in TV and Film Tarzan will be swinging across the silver screen once again when ""The Legend of Tarzan"" hits theaters on July 1. The film is the latest entry in the King of Apes decades-long legacy on television and in the movies. Photo Warner Bros. Pictures The most consistent source of gleelessness turns out to be the special effects which are as dispirited and dispiriting as those in ""The BFG"" are elating. They consist mainly of off-the-shelf swarms of computer-generated animals that look exactly wonder of wonders like computer-generated animals. No grace no surprises no individuation just swarms that swarm in the disembodied tradition of ""Jumanji."" And when Tarzan takes to the trees in his inevitable effort to rescue Jane his digital surrogate is seen mainly in murky furtive glimpses that made me yearn for the gorgeously fluid and forthright animation of Disneys 1999 ""Tarzan"" which freed its hero from the twin bonds of gravity and reality and brought him to life in the process. Hows that for gleeful paradox? Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download Focus (2015) Margot Robbie is Jess Barrett an apprentice to Will Smiths Nicky Spurgeon the mastermind of a pickpocketing crew that fans out through city streets crammed with easy marks. Shes got an unerring gift for romantic comedy and aces her role from the start. Still this glossy caper with exotic locations comes to feel like a con thanks to a script thats too clever by two-thirds and butterfingered in the ways of portraying love.

Alexander Skarsgard in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Stop me if youve seen this one before. After umpteen onscreen appearances Tarzan is back. Disappointing but ambitious ""The Legend of Tarzan"" uses Edgar Rice Burroughs source material selectively rather than slavishly. Director David Yates who gave us four workmanlike chapters in the ""Harry Potter"" cycle reboots the iconic king of the jungle through a narrative time portal. He introduces Lord Greystoke to viewers years after his departure from the wild. He is a refined British adult wearing 1880s Victorian finery and sipping his tea with a properly extended pinkie finger. Alexander Skarsgard plays the part with understatement suiting a man living far from his home (central Africa) and family (a tribe of apes that raised him through infancy when his explorer parents passed). A civilized gent who speaks with adjectives and verbs he is recruited by Her Majestys government to investigate troubling developments in the Belgian Congo. The contemptible King Leopold II intends to strip his possession of every diamond and ivory tusk at whatever cost of local life that may require. The tone is far more somber than most Tarzan predecessors where monkeyshines and fun were reliable ingredients in the mix. Yates seems to be making this eras Tarzan a dark hybrid of art and realistic truth about racism and xenophobia giving the enterprise a solemn air. Its a valiant struggle but it feels calculated rather than organic and entertaining. Skarsgard who spends a lot of time abandoning shirts to bare his lithe rangy physique swings on African vines like Spider-Man whipping across Manhattan on monofilament. He pursues his spy mission with the aid of his gorgeous squeeze-turned-spouse Jane (Margot Robbie delivering a bit of spirited self-reliant ""I am woman hear me roar"" energy). Warner Bros. Alexander Skarsgard is Tarzan. They are accompanied by a Civil War veteran from the United States George Washington Williams. In that role Samuel L. Jackson again proves his ability to zing the dreariest lines. The film reunites Jackson with his frequent co-star Christoph Waltz playing the central baddie as a shy nerdy character with a talent for using his crucifix and rosary beads as a lethal garrote. Like much of whats on display here hes not credible in the least. The saga doesnt tell a coherent story so much as juggle tropes images and archetypes from earlier more enjoyable adaptations. This ""Tarzan"" never develops a consistent or recognizable groove. Though it is plotted with limited imagination it overflows with assaultive sensory overkill. Yates turns his many combat scenes up to full Harry Potter spectacle. There are ongoing animal attacks featuring armies of ostriches wildebeests hippos and crocodiles. Tarzan has several rockem-sockem mano a mano battles with apes and even against Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou) an enemy warlord who resents him so much hell give diamonds to Brussels for the chance to kill him. When its not laboring clunkily to generate excitement the film delivers the longest most lingering full-face close-ups ever collected in an action film. Certainly its good to observe a Titian-haired beauty like Robbie and a brooding performer like Waltz at length. Its better than keeping our focus on the non-African-looking locations but it makes the focus of the film fade into the background. Like much in the movie its a challenging idea thats innovative in an imperfect way. colincovert ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Despite points for effort and ingenuity ""The Legend of Tarzan"" doesnt do much to improve on that tradition. Directed by David Yates (a veteran of the Harry Potter movies) ""Tarzan"" knows its way around computer-generated animals a far cry from Johnny Weissmuller wrestling with rubber alligators or dropping in nature footage in the 1930s and 40s. But this Warner Bros. release actually shares a problem with the studios recent ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" The movie seeks to jump-start an expensive theatrical franchise by beginning in the middle skipping logical steps in between. (Like CNN Warner Bros. is a unit of Time WarnerTime Warner (TWX).) As a consequence ""Legend of Tarzan"" feels like the sequel to a movie that wasnt made -- at least with these principals -- dealing with the characters origins in brief gauzy flashbacks. Instead it opens in England circa 1890 where an American named George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) based on a real person approaches John Clayton (Alexander Skarsgard) about journeying with him to the Congo. The goal To expose the exploitation and enslavement of the people by Belgiums King Leopold. Related The BFG cant recapture Steven Spielbergs old magic Claytons invitation has come from the Belgian government. But its really a trap conceived by Leopolds envoy Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz as his by-now trademark-able villain) to lure Tarzan to Africa. The plan is to trade him to a vengeful chief (Djimon Hounsou) gaining access to fabulous diamonds from the lost city of Opar. Screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer have drawn from later editions of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs books. They have also sought to make Claytons wife Jane (Margot Robbie) more than just a damsel in distress even if her abduction forces Tarzan on a perilous quest to retrieve her. In some respects ""Legend of Tarzan"" is a step up from previous adaptations. Its more fun than ""Greystoke The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes"" which started well but became overly preoccupied with the duality of the title characters wild and noble sides. Related Independence Day sequel loses the battle against silliness Still the movie winds up a bit muddled in part because it has to work so hard seeking to remedy more troubling aspects of the Tarzan mythology. That includes the books early-20th-century racial overtones with the whole plot here animated by a strong anti-colonial message. Jackson thus provides Tarzan not only a squabbling companion but a balance to the whole white savior routine. Already a heartthrob from ""True Blood"" Skarsgard doesnt shed his shirt right away but when he finally does its a marvel of human engineering. For the most part the movie looks great too barring a few moments where the CGI rather literally runs wild. But this is a tough narrative to essentially join in progress and a thankless title role -- part English lord part taciturn superhuman savage part Dr. Dolittle sharing tender moments with old pals the elephant and the lion. ""My husband is no normal man"" Jane ominously warns Rom. True enough but ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is finally a pretty ordinary would-be summer blockbuster. ""The Legend of Tarzan"" opens July 1 in the U.S. and Canada.

Jackson (left) and Alexander Skarsgard in ""The Legend of Tarzan.""       Photo Warner Bros. Pictures MOVIE REVIEW THE LEGEND OF TARZAN Running time 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence). Alexander Skarsgard drained a lot of victims dry as a sexy vampire on HBO but none of them was as bloodless as ""The Legend of Tarzan."" The latest spin on Edgar Rice Burroughs story of the man raised by apes is a plodding incoherent mess starring Skarsgard and his abs which look more real than any of his CGI jungle companions. Director David Yates (""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"") plunks us down with the adult Tarzan in the late 1800s after hes returned to civilization as the nobleman John Clayton. Hes married to his love Jane (an underused Margot Robbie) but slightly unfulfilled; you can tell because everything in England is shot in a sad blue light. Arriving rather unfortunately on the heels of ""Free State of Jones"" this ""Tarzan"" is yet another white-savior story in which Clayton ventures back to his African homeland to save Congolese tribes from enslavement by diamond-mining Belgians. The nasty Belgians are headed by Christoph Waltz in familiar mild-mannered menace mode; his statesman Leon Rom makes a dirty deal with a tribal chief (Djimon Hounsou) whos got a vendetta against Tarzan. Theres a very boring discussion with harrumphing British politicians about why Clayton should accept an invitation to the Congo and for some reason Samuel L. Jacksons American envoy George Washington Williams is there to accompany him and through all of it youre just waiting for Skarsgard to shed the fancy suit and become Tarzan already. Once he does the film briefly hits its stride. Skarsgard gets to show off a playful graceful physicality as he and Jacksons character careen through the jungle running into various animal friends and adversaries (Skarsgard nuzzling a lion will be an excellent GIF) and hopping from tree to vine. Williams struggles to keep up wisecracking in a very Samuel L. Jackson-esque manner Anachronistic sure but at least entertaining. By the time theyre joining forces with tribesmen and gorillas to loose water buffaloes on a Belgian encampment viewers patience will likely have worn thin. Youd think the screenplay by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer might have tried harder to escape the racist origins of the old ""Tarzan"" stories which were rife with caricature. By having its black actors largely stand by and cheer as the white guy does most of the heavy lifting -- not to mention keeping its plucky heroine literally handcuffed most of the time -- ""Tarzan"" does little to adapt to modern times. Perhaps most punishingly of all for Skarsgards ""True Blood"" fans it fails to ever put our hero in a skimpy loincloth.

"The Legend of Tarzan retells old tale but why? Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Legend of Tarzan retells old tale but why? Review Its possible even likely that more effort was expended on sculpting Alexander Skarsgards abs for The Legend of Tarzan than on providing good reason why the movie was made.Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard are the latest to play Jane and Tarzan.  (Warner Bros.)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 30 2016The Legend of TarzanStarring Alexander Skarsgard Margot Robbie Christoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by David Yates. Opens July 1 at major theatres. 110 minutes. PGIts possible even likely that more effort was expended on sculpting Alexander Skarsgards abs for The Legend of Tarzan than on providing good reason why the movie was made.Magnificent abs they are a carved six-pack that could bounce not just a gold coin but an entire bag of them. Article Continued BelowTheyre also among the few things that actually look real in a film so larded with CGI little appears to have any weight or substance within the hazy grey-green digital foliage.This includes the convoluted story directed by David Yates of multiple Harry Potter endeavours. In telling for the umpteenth time the Edgar Rice Burroughs yarn of a noble Englishman raised by apes in ""savage"" Africa the movie swings like the title vine-grabber past issues of colonial conquest genocide environmental abuse and the ever-popular white-saviour complex never quite landing on any of them. It also takes a shot at organized religion via the rosary beads that chief villain Captain Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz on autopilot) uses to choke anyone who crosses him. As the supposedly loyal envoy of Africa-raping King Leopold II of Belgium Rom seeks rare diamonds from a Congolese chief (Djimon Hounsou) who has a grudge against Tarzan and who is willing to make a blood deal to settle it. The Tarzan tale and the man himself get lost in the narrative undergrowth. Skarsgard is a fine actor but his brooding and nearly mute performance both as the jungle hero and the citified John Clayton III Lord Greystoke inspires shrugs more than awe even when hes doing battle with the computer-generated apes. His back story is told via a series of flashbacks which fractures the narrative rather than serving it.What flesh-and-blood energy the movie possesses comes from two people one a sidekick and the other a spouse. Samuel L. Jacksons cowboy character George Washington Williams is a U.S. envoy and real historical figure. Seeking Greystone/Tarzans help in exposing Leopolds evil acts by alerting an unsuspecting world to Africas plight he provides both armed backup and needed comic relief. Margot Robbie plays the famous Jane the feisty wife of Tarzan and fellow lover of Africa. She takes the distress out of being a damsel no mean feat for a movie as clumsily hidebound as this one.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

VPCThe Legend of Tarzan is a big-budget misfire that sorely lacks any sense of fun. Give me Johnny Weismuller any day.Spoiler alert Not once does our leading man say ""Me Tarzan you Jane"" in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Alexander Skarsgard and Margot Robbie star.(Photo Jonathan Olley)Story HighlightsCritics rating 2 out of 5 stars""Unfun"" isnt a real word but boy it sure describes ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Im no great connoisseur of Edgar Rice Burroughs ape man but this movie doesnt even boast the junky charms of Bo Dereks 1981 Tarzan opus or the old TV series with Ron Ely.RELATED Alexander Skarsgard gives Legend of Tarzan body and soulThe problems start with the movies tone. More accurately its the utter lack of one. Under the direction of David Yates (hes behind four Harry Potter films) it bops around like a pinball never settling on one particular feel. One minute its a sincere period drama; the next its a campy over-the-top comic book; then its a bloated spectacle. Yates unfortunately cant make the worlds mesh in convincing fashion.Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) and Jane (Margot Robbie) enjoy a quiet moment in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" (Photo Jonathan Olley)A similarly annoying schism exists with the actors and their characters. In one corner youve got Alexander Skarsgard (""True Blood"") going for a deep soulful version of Tarzan. His ape man has settled into midlife as Lord Greystoke a member of the House of Lords in the 1890s. Skarsgard is fine if a little dry and ponderous. One wishes he brought a touch of whimsy to the action.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceThen youve got Margot Robbie as Tarzans wife Jane. The character is designed to be feisty but Robbie plays the role as if every line is written with an exclamation point at the end. Shes way too broad. On the other hand this probably marks the only time in Tarzan film history that Jane insults the baddie with what is essentially a ""your mama"" joke so shes probably doing the best she can.Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) returns to the jungle in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" (Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)The two leave England accompanied by George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson basically playing well Samuel L. Jackson) and venture to the jungle. The reason is an overly complicated scheme involving Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz in mustache-twirling mode) who lures Tarzan back so he can capture the ape man and hand him to an enemy in exchange for a fortune in diamonds. Rom is dastardly and strangles his foes with a rosary; you imagine the actor spent oh five minutes delving into his characters motivations.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestIn the jungle Rom kidnaps Jane and keeps her in chains yet her makeup always looks perfectly fabulous like shes ready for a gig in the latest BBC period drama. Tarzan runs around shirtless and battles with Akut his old ape ""sibling"" for some you-cant-go-home-again psychology while Williams tosses off one-liners. Its loud and busy but terribly empty because we dont care about anyone onscreen. Its simply an exercise in going through the motions.

Jackson) in tow theyre forced to deal with Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) an envoy of the bankrupt Belgian king with an eye for rare diamonds and Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou) a tribal chieftain who seeks revenge against Tarzan.Yates plot gets lost in the bushes and Tarzan brings up intriguing themes yet fumbles most of them. Tarzan is torn between human and animal worlds a contrast nicely symbolized in the different ways hes welcomed by old African friends and his gorilla brethren. Slavery problems in the Congo Janes backstory as a child and Tarzans code of honor are all hinted at but tossed aside for a litany of slow-motion fights between Tarzan and gorillas and Tarzan and restless natives.The lions elephants and especially gorillas appear phenomenal up close. But when the camera pulls back for the bigger action scenes the special effects fall apart as herds of water buffalo and other four-legged buddies come to Tarzans rescue.USA TODAYAlexander Skarsgard ate vicariously through Margot Robbie for TarzanAnything physical involving Skarsgard looks great from his fluid movements through the trees (with some CGI help) to his ridiculously cut abs. But as a character he veers toward the stoic and doesnt seem loose enough for a guy whos one with nature -- gone is the easy charm Skarsgard exuded on True Blood that would have made a more dynamic hero. The actor does enjoy a natural chemistry with Robbie when theyre onscreen together though she spends much of her time playing damsel-in-distress to Waltzs dud of a bad guy.Jackson however keeps Tarzan watchable adding both comic relief and a moral conscience. Of everyone hes having the most fun running around in the forest his character getting winded amid all the derring-do and being wowed by Tarzans friendship with his furry pals.In that way Jackson is the true king of this jungle though maybe not the one Yates and Co. had in mind. 101 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 20 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/292BS8i,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/06/30/review-the-legend-of-tarzan-movie/86516000/,200,thelegendoftarzan24,thelegendoftarzan,usatoday

Margot Robbie plays his Jane. Directed by four-time ""Harry Potter"" veteran David Yates. In theaters July 1. advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In the late 19th century an aristocrat raised by gorillas returns to his endangered native habitat.CAST Alexander Skarsgard Margot Robbie Samuel L. Jackson Christoph WaltzRATED PG-13 (rough action)LENGTH 142BOTTOM LINE The white savior with the animal sexuality returns in another campy ""Tarzan"" movie. Two years ago when Harry Belafonte accepted an honorary humanitarian Oscar for his fight against racism he singled out what he considered one of Hollywoods worst offenders Tarzan. ""This porcelain Adonis this white liberator who could speak no language swinging from tree to tree saving Africa from the tragedy of destruction"" Belafonte called him. He even credited Tarzan with sparking his own personal rebellion ""against injustice and human distortion and hate."" advertisement | advertise on newsday Belafontes words surely echoed in the heads of the filmmakers behind ""The Legend of Tarzan"" who faced a difficult challenge How to bring Edgar Rice Burroughs uncivilized he-man -- who first appeared in 1912 -- swinging into 21st century theaters. The movie wants to provide the thrills of an old-fashioned action adventure (its directed with high Hollywood gloss by David Yates of the final ""Harry Potter"" movies) while stepping gingerly around modern sensibilities. Alas it doesnt fully succeed on either count. Mostly the inherent silliness of the original material reduces ""The Legend of Tarzan"" to mild camp. Photos10 best movies of 2016 so farSUMMERS MUST-SEE MOVIES25 big movies out this summerPhotos31 big summer blockbusters In this version Tarzan long ago left his ape family to become British aristocrat John Clayton III. Instead of the alert animalistic Johnny Weissmuller of the 1930s Tarzan films we get Alexander Skarsgard -- intense but humorless -- as a cultured man who still has the jungle inside him. At the urging of Dr. George Washington Williams (a lively Samuel L. Jackson) Tarzan returns to the Congo and learns that Belgian mastermind Leon Rom (a deliciously despicable Christoph Waltz) is enslaving the countrys tribesmen. Are your colonialist alarm bells ringing? Rest assured that ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is more laughable than offensive. Its difficult to keep a straight face when Jane (Margot Robbie) follows Tarzans mating calls to their bedroom or when Tarzan fights a gorilla five times his size or when he greets several hungry lionesses by nuzzling them. At one point he even lets out that famous yodel albeit slightly modified. ""Its not quite how I imagined it"" muses Rom. The whole point of Tarzan of course was his reductive uncivilized nature. Here he wears pants instead of a loincloth but itll take more than that to update this stubbornly outdated creature.

Close Join the conversation... With Britton Peele Share This Story Share Discuss Meh It would be easy to say ""Havent we had enough Tarzan movies by now?"" After all filmmakers have shared Edgar Rice Burroughs stories about the King of the Jungle for nearly 100 years and while the movies havent all been good there are enough of them to make the story feel familiar.A baby is orphaned in the jungle and is raised by apes. He grows up as a friend of all animals then eventually meets some fellow humans and falls in love with one of them (Jane) before leaving the jungle to try to make a ""normal"" life for himself in England. Been there done that. Do you think Tarzans abs are CG? Jonathan Olley/AP For the most part The Legend of Tarzan is right there with you. While it retells Tarzans origin story through a series of flashbacks throughout the film the story actually begins after the most familiar part of the characters plot. Tarzan (Alexander SkarsgAY=rd) has left the jungle behind and is living by his given name John Clayton III. (Not to be confused with John Carter another Edgar Rice Burroughs character who had a less-successful journey to the big screen not too long ago.) Hes married to Jane (Margot Robbie) and has no interest in going back to Africa. Hes already seen it and its too hot.But of course he goes back to Africa. He takes off his shirt wrestles some apes snuggles with some lions stares into the eyes of some elephants and makes some physics-defying swings from vines (seriously one of those swings is so egregious it would make Spider-Man jealous). There is a lot of CG wildlife along the way but most of it is impressive enough that you can suspend your disbelief. Somehow the idea that Tarzan has an ape brother that he can communicate with isnt the thing that should cause anyone to raise an eyebrow.Honestly the most unbelievable parts of the movie are due to cheese rather than plot. The worst example is a scene that attempts to set a romantic mood by having Jane talk to herself about various animal mating calls while wandering through empty rooms. The movie does something interesting beyond skipping to the middle. It blends fiction with history. Tarzans main antagonist is LA(c)on Rom (Christoph Waltz) a corrupt Belgian soldier whose lust for power drives him to kill those in his way without a moments hesitation. Sometimes he does so by choking them with the crucifix-adorned jewelry he keeps with him at all times. While The Legend of Tarzan obviously isnt a biographical account a real Rom did exist and research suggests that he wasnt pleasant. A Slideshow of 4 Photos Samuel L. Jackson Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Jonathan Olley/TNS Christoph Waltz in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Jonathan Olley/TNS This image released by Warner Bros. Entertainment shows Samuel L. Jackson in a scene from ""The Legend of Tarzan."" AP This image released by Warner Bros. Entertainment shows Alexander Skarsgard left and Samuel L. Jackson in a scene from ""The Legend of Tarzan."" Jonathan Olley/AP Samuel L. Jacksons character meanwhile is Civil War veteran George Washington Williams. In both the movie and in life Williams is concerned by atrocities he sees during his visit to the Congo Free State. This concern is the driving force behind Tarzans return to the jungle - he cant relax at his fancy home in England if theres a possibility that his family in Africa might be enslaved.The Legend of Tarzan benefits greatly from mostly skipping the well-tread territory. There is no on-screen ""Me Tarzan you Jane"" moment. We dont have to watch Tarzan struggle to learn English. The movie assumes youre smart enough to put those pieces together yourself based on snippets and glimpses of the past.But its still a movie that for better or worse is trapped by faithfulness to its source material. Predictably Jane ends up as a damsel in distress (though to her credit she tries not to be). There are also moments that flirt with uncomfortable conversations about race - these are handled mostly well though they sidestep any opportunity to say something too deep.All told though Tarzans adventure back to the Congo is enjoyable. It tells enough of the backstory that newcomers to the character wont be lost while breezing over enough that old-timers wont immediately feel bored. It makes several non-human characters relatable without resorting to make them audibly speak (or sing). And its got flashy spectacle and action scenes that are fun to watch (even if youre only in it for shirtless SkarsgAY=rd).It doesnt re-invent the vine but The Legend of Tarzan swings its way into being one of the better on-screen adaptations of the classic character.

Tarzan and all of the other jungle characters created by Edgar Rice Burroughs in 1912 have been dragged out of mothballs in countless movie incarnations thrilling new generations and featuring a wide variety of Muscle McGurks from Buster Crabbe to Lex Barker most famously in the series of MGM blockbusters starring Olympic swimming champion Johnny Weissmuller as the Ape Man and Maureen OSullivan (Mia Farrows mother) as Jane. The last time around the tree house was the 1984 saga Grekystoke The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes with French hunk Christopher Lambert which attempted to tell the original story as visualized by the author. Some producer who is firmly convinced that the moviegoing public has an insatiable appetite for monkey business has now come up with a lavish expensive woefully digitalized version of the legend that is again based on the original Burroughs adventure. The vision conceived by director David Yates who made the final four Harry Potter films is so close to the 1984 Greystoke that I fear the public may prove him wrong. Despite the exorbitant price tag it all looks and feels perilously close to something weve seen before. THE LEGEND OF TARZAN  (3/4 stars) Written by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer Directed by David Yates Starring Margot Robbie Alexander Skarsgard and Ella Purnell Running time 109 min. Fans of the old MGM series will be disappointed that Jane has become an American there is no Boy or mischievous chimpanzee named Cheetah (both of whom were MGM inventions) and Tarzan is now an impeccably dressed English aristocrat refined by perfect diction and the title Lord John Clayton III heir to the estate left by his grandfather the sixth Earl of Greystoke. Flashbacks refer to the shipwreck on the Ivory Coast that left him stranded in the wilds of Africa and raised by gorillas. Twenty years later he was discovered as a man nude as the censors would allow swinging on vines and returned to civilization where he exchanged a loincloth for a three-piece suit and learned to prefer Earl Grey tea to yak milk. The new plot begins when Tarzan now an emissary from Parliament returns to the Congo with Jane in tow to save the natives from exploitation and a genocide masterminded by diabolical Belgian villain Captain Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) who plunders their diamond supply guarded by a tribe whose chief promises him the jewels on one condition bring back Tarzan for the tribe to torture and kill. Tarzan declines the invitation with one of the films best lines ""Ive already seen Africa--and its hot"" You have to admire the sheer physical scope of this epic even if there are no animals in it. The gorillas lions and crocodiles hankering to make a meal of Tarzan are all computer-generated and have lost their bite. The gorillas snarl and bare their fangs fighting Tarzan out of revenge for old times sake but they look like dress extras in gorilla costumes from old Jungle Jim flicks. Jane (Margot Robbie) misses her old sarong but still speaks a mean Watusi. She gets chased through the water at high speed by a hungry hippopotamus. Handsome Alexander Skarsgard is pumped buffed and camera-ready but too pretty and delicate-looking to be mistaken for Tarzan. And Samuel L. Jackson of all people is a survivor of the Civil War who tags along to make sure the natives are not turned into slaves. Which leaves Waltz to walk away with most of the footage conducting another of his sublime master classes in the art of delectable villainy a smarmy smile on his face in a white ice cream suit.

Hes living the good life at the ancestral manse outside London town with his lovely wife Jane and no way does he want to return to his former arboreal haunts in the Congo. Tough bananas ape man. Theres villainy afoot with a white-suited dastard scheming to lure you into a deadly trap back in the bush. And there thus lured with shirt off -- geez that man is buff; get a load of those so-cut pecs -- but pants on he swings through the trees bellowing his trademark yell and then bashes sneering bad guys in the head nuzzles lion buddies caresses majestic elephants and otherwise does his Tarzany thing in the time-honored manner. Alexander Skarsgard plays Our Hero as a dour cuss a man of relatively few but well-articulated words -- civilized -- who truly does love dewy Jane (Margot Robbie smiling glowingly). And when the white-suited schemer played by Christoph Waltz with silken charm covering steely villainy takes Jane captive angering the ape man no end well you can guess the rest. Tarzan is helped in his rescue quest by Samuel L. Jackson playing an American adventurer in the mold of his ""Hateful Eight"" character a sharpshooting Civil War vet but one who has gone through a crisis of conscience after a stint as a killer mercenary. Threaded through the narrative is Tarzans origin story told in gauzy sun-drenched his-and-her flashbacks. ""Legend"" is not a bad picture as Tarzan movies go. Directed by David Yates (the last four ""Harry Potter"" pictures) it exhibits a social conscience as it pits its protagonist against enslaving Belgian mercenaries. However it presents a happier outcome than what really went on in the Congo under the reign of King Leopold II in the late 1800s which was decades of slavery and mass murder of the indigenous peoples. Its theme of white man as savior of black Africans is to say the least highly anachronistic in these days and times.

(Jonathan Olley/Warner Bros. Entertainment via AP) Photo Jonathan Olley Associated Press A Legend of Tarzan thats a strange jumble in the jungle 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Some big ideas are also bad ideas and theres a big bad one at the heart of ""The Legend of Tarzan."" The idea was to take some of the true history of Congo and its exploitation by the Belgians in the 19th century and throw it together with the story of Tarzan. It makes for an awkward mix for a movie that is both confusing and weirdly inert. Congo at this time was under the control of King Leopold of Belgium and one of his agents in charge was a fellow named Leon Rom who was such a horrible human being that Christoph Waltz plays him here. At least he plays a version of him because the movie doesnt quite adhere to the facts. In ""The Legend of Tarzan"" he is wiping out elephants for the ivory and impressing the native people into slavery. At the same time he is fastidious and polite and never raises his voice. By now its clear Christoph Waltz is incapable of being boring even in a soporific movie. He creates a character whos not merely evil but twisted operating from a philosophy and an unknowable past history. Theres a turn of mind here thats arresting and expressed in an odd ways as when he reaches across a table and corrects an imprecision in the cutlery. Killing people doesnt bother him but a fork in the wrong place really gets under his skin. Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) enters the picture because ... well its hard to say. At the start of the film he and Jane (Margot Robbie) are living in an enormous castle their jungle years behind them. He is persuaded to return to Africa by an African American politician George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) a real-life figure who really did travel to Congo to explore the treatment of the Congolese. In this fictionalized version Williams feels that he needs Tarzan to help publicize his findings. As presented here Tarzan is a large dull fellow lacking in conversation or humor so unless hes doing something particularly interesting -- such as nuzzling with jungle cats or communing with elephants -- he is pretty much a washout onscreen. Skarsgard is physically impressive however tall enough to make Jackson seem short and he clearly spent hundreds of hours in the gym in preparation for taking off his shirt. If only the screenwriters had put as much time into figuring out what to do with Tarzan once they placed him in Africa. Tarzans mission is a jumble. He is there to discover bad things and perhaps to stop them. But for most of the movie he is simply trying to rescue Jane (she insisted on coming) from the clutches of the evil Rom. And though the movie makes an attempt to justify it Roms motive for kidnapping Jane makes little sense. Hes trying to do something nefarious in Congo so he kidnaps the wife of the most gifted and savvy man on the continent. Hes inviting a conflict with the only person who can beat him. ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is not without stray moments of cinematic charm. Every time Waltz is in conversation with Robbie who is as radiant and straightforward here as Waltz is dark and skewed the movie wakes up. And the close-ups of lions apes and elephants have the appeal of a trip to the zoo without the accompanying sad feeling of seeing animals imprisoned. But there is something strangely dead about most of the film which is mostly just a succession of scenes lacking energy suspense or interest. In the last third an attempt is made to enliven things but the action feels appended and at least in one case (an invasion by apes) the CGI is disastrously fake-looking. In the end what we have here is a Tarzan movie made by people who dont understand the appeal of Tarzan. Hes about joy and abandon and the fantasy of living in harmony with creation. Hes not about the struggle in Congo. Thats a worthy subject but for a different kind of movie. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Jackson and Alexander Skarsgard in ""The Legend of Tarzan."" | Warner Bros. Pictures Richard Roeper richardroeper | email Sign-Up for Chicago Sun-Times Entertainment Newsletter Receive Theater Celebrity amp; Entertainment related Updates Sign-Up When Edgar Rice Burroughs published ""Tarzan of the Apes"" in a pulp magazine in 1912 even his active imagination probably couldnt have envisioned how many mostly mediocre and sometimes painfully awful versions of the vine-swinging ululating Jane-loving King of the Jungle would follow. From the silent features of the 1910s and 1920s through the kinda terrible Johnny Weissmuller B-movies of the 1930s and 1940s through the horrific ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" with Miles OKeeffe and Bo Derek in 1981 through the ambitious and competent ""Greystoke"" in 1984 through Disneys animated ""Tarzan"" in 1999 (not to mention all the stage plays and TV shows and radio serials) weve had tons of Tarzan adaptations -- but not a single legitimately great movie. That streak remains intact. ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is certainly the most expensive and the most epic adaptation. The special effects available today are an obvious advantage over the old days when wed see Tarzan yelling and then wed cut to stock footage of animals in the jungle. But theres always been something a bit ridiculous about the whole Tarzan premise and while the talented cast and a solid director make for a serviceable and intermittently entertaining adventure theres very little about this film that screams YOU GOTTA SEE THIS. (And that includes the alleged 3D which is put to terrific use in exactly one shot late in the movie and is otherwise a non-factor.) Its the late 1880s. Alexander Skarsgard (""True Blood"") plays John Clayton III the Earl of Greystoke lord of the manor husband to the beautiful Jane (Margot Robbie) and respected member of British politics and society. Hes also a celebrity who is mobbed by children and adored by all because they know his backstory parents marooned after a shipwreck Mom and Dad die raised by apes lord of the jungle talked to the animals etc. etc. Ah but thats all in the past until an American named George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson sporting a distracting hairpiece I think was designed to make him look younger) persuades John to return home to the Congo to investigate rumors the King of Belgium is using slave labor. We never see the evil King of Belgium -- but he cant possibly be more mustache-twirlingly rotten to the core than his emissary the slithering manipulative psychopathic Captain Rom who is played by Christoph Waltz and while Christoph Waltz is a great actor it might be time for him to take a break from playing villains who love the sound of their own voices. The casting is almost too easy. The plucky Jane whos considerably more resourceful and independent than just about every previous incarnation of the character insists on accompanying John. After all the Congo was Janes home too; she grew up there because her father was a missionary/educator. George Washington Williams is handy with a shotgun and loyal to his new friend but the character exists mainly for comic relief and to look on in astonishment as John reunites with old friends including lions and elephants. Which brings us to perhaps the most serious drawback of the film the jungle creatures. Theyre all CGI and far too many times they look VERY CGI. Some of the apes have more animated facial expressions than mid-1990s Jim Carrey while ostriches the aforementioned lions hippos and other creatures look great from a distance but not so believable when the humans are ""interacting"" with them. ""The Legend of Tarzan"" also stalls a bit whenever John or Jane gazes into the distance indicating its time for another flashback sequence about Johns boyhood in the jungle and then his first meeting with Jane when he sniffs her and picks at her and then nearly dies protecting her. The good stuff Skarsgards a specimen who manages to not look silly when hes swinging from tree to tree or nuzzling lions and hes a decent enough actor. Robbie looks great and gives Jane loads of sass even when shes shackled and verbally sparring with the loathsome Captain Rom. Djimon Honsou has a couple of memorable moments as the tribal chief who wants Tarzan dead -- and for a legitimate reason. Its also an upgrade from previous Tarzan films to see the Congolese portrayed as a proud smart family- and community-oriented people. Though theres still a lot of Tarzan hero worship going on -- even though it appears as though half the men in Tarzans home village are just about as good as he is when it comes to the whole running-climbing-jumping-survival thing. 1/2 Warner Bros. Pictures presents a film directed by David Yates and written by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer based on the Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Running time 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sequences of action and violence some sensuality and brief rude dialogue). Opens Friday at local theaters.

Jackson) run through the jungle in The Legend of Tarzan. Jonathan Olley WARNER BROS. i By Rene Rodriguezrrodriguezmiamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Theres a nice moment early in The Legend of Tarzan in which a child notices John Clayton (Alexander Skarsgard) has unusually large hands like a mutant and when he kneels down he rests his body on his knuckles like a gorilla. The audience of course knows something the kid doesnt Clayton aka Lord Greystoke was formerly known as Tarzan the king of the apes before he left the African habitat where he was raised and moved to London to lead a gentrified life with his beloved Jane (Margot Robbie). The quick shot of Claytons hand is a small and thoughtful detail -- the only new facet this huge cumbersome movie adds to Tarzan lore. The Legend of Tarzan is the 857th movie incarnation of Edgar Rice Burroughs pulpy adventure novels but its the first one in which the production notes state ""no real animals were used in the making of the film"" as if that were something to brag about. Disneys live-action remake of The Jungle Book had no real tigers or snakes either but the animals in that one talked and occasionally sang. British director David Yates who brought the Harry Potter series to such a satisfying conclusion (he directed the last four installments) does such an impersonal job with this material that you wonder if he lost a bet. He sent cameras all the way to Gabon to capture authentic background footage but half of the movie looks like it was shot on the set of The Phantom Menace. Even the sky looks painted and fake. Once Tarzan finally sheds his city-slicker gear and gives in to his inner savage (almost an hour in) the film starts to feel like a Marvel Comics production. The screenplay by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer is cut from the superhero-movie template complete with a maniacal power-hungry villain (Christoph Waltz coasting on his Inglourious Basterds schtick) and a comic-relief sidekick (Samuel L. Jackson as George Washington Williams a Civil War veteran). Margot Robbies Jane is much more empowered than the characters previous incarnations but in the end she exists basically to be rescued. There is also a subplot involving an African tribal chief (Djimon Hounsou) who has an old score to settle with Tarzan. That storyline is the strongest in the film raising intriguing questions about a world in which only the strong survive. But it gets resolved in such an unsatisfying manner that you assume it was included just to set up a sequel -- one that I am pretty certain will never happen now. The Legend of Tarzan doles out big beats of action at regular intervals to keep you awake like a drunkard clashing trashcan lids in an alley late at night. But your eyelids grow heavy anyway. When elephants trample across the screen they feel weightless like balloons. The gorillas are decent but Yates pushes credulity too far by having them emote. Skarsgard lets his abs do most of his acting. When Tarzan swings from a tree vine the effects are so cartoonish he might as well be Spider-Man. And when he belts out his trademark jungle yell it sounds like a cry for help as in ""Help me get out of this movie."" The feeling is mutual. Movie Info Rating  Cast Alexander Skarsgard Samuel L.

She Jane. Me pretty sure you heard this one before. Approximately a million yards of celluloid have already been dedicated to the character Edgar Rice Burroughs created more than a century ago portraying fictions most famous gorilla whisperer as everything from the lunky mute of the silent-movie era to the loinclothed Renaissance man of Disneys late-90s animated blockbuster. This particular version has been in the works since 2003--the same year incidentally that the WB launched a doomed small-screen series featuring future Vikings star Travis Fimmel as a modern-day Tarzan who romanced an NYPD detective and parkoured topless across Manhattan rooftops. Legend is far more faithful to the source material than that but it does offer up a new narrative Third Earl of Greystoke John Clayton (Alexander Skarsgard) now a domesticated gentleman safely settled in his ancestral English manor and happily married to his Jane (Margot Robbie) is called to serve as a trade emissary to the Congo--though what the British really want to know is exactly what kind of sketchy colonizing business Belgiums King Leopold is up to there. With Jane and an American statesman named George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) in tow the prodigal son returns to his homeland and is given a heros welcome by CGI lions and adoring natives alike. One man though seeks him out for more nefarious reasons Leopolds squirrelly consigliere Leon Rom (played by Christoph Waltz in a jazzy little Panama hat because apparently the Congo was one corner of the globe he had not yet terrorized on film). Leons there to funnel as many blood diamonds as he can into the seams of his white linen suit and this tall blond monkey man plays into his plans in a way that can only end in death for one or both of them. What follows wont surprise even the most credulous moviegoer; the whole thing feels almost endearingly old-fashioned in plot and execution despite a few winky nods to more modern ideas. Jackson in particular doesnt even try to temper his anachronisms; hes so 21st-century sardonic you half expect him to suddenly remember he has an iPhone and GPS his way back to a Tarantino set. (Though his character is based on a real historical figure--the man who should actually be honored here for exposing Leopolds ghastly exploitation of slave labor to the world.) And how is Skarsgard? All sad eyes and fiberglass abs he hardly speaks; theres more dialogue implied by his deltoids than the scant mutterings the script allows him. But he does look fantastic and the equally pretty Robbie works hard to bring some feminist nerve to her handcuffed-damsel role. Though the film was shot almost entirely on a London soundstage it rarely misses a chance to pan a sweeping shot across lush forests and glistening waterfalls and amber waves of Congolese grain; theres a whole lot of post-production magic here--especially in the Noahs Ark of exotic animals that stand by ready to heed Tarzans beck and call like eager extras on the set of Madagascar. The audience will eventually get more than one bellowing dose of that trademark yodel plus multiple scenes of gymnastic vine-swinging. You just wish--after two solid but oddly joyless hours--that Legend strained less to hit its marks and swung a little more.

You sleepy. Put the loincloths away The Lord of the Apes will not be rescuing the most dire summer movie season in ages. He may be able to nimbly swing from vines but he lands with a thud in an ill-conceived adventure. Simply put The Legend of Tarzan (opening Friday July 1) is so dreadful that you will root for the gorillas to eat the evil humans just so it will end faster. Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan in The Legend of Tarzan. Jonathan Olley/Warner Bros. This is a gung-ho character that dates all the way back to 1912. There was a film franchise in the 1930s and 40s (starring a former Olympic swimmer and Mia Farrows mother) a dozen more books and countless TV series. Disney got in on the act in 1999 with an animated flick that featured lots of Phil Collins songs and a pre-Scandal Tony Goldwyn as the voice of the man himself. And throughout these iterations the basic plot remained unchanged an orphaned boy who was raised by friendly apes in the jungle returns to the wilds as a fearless adventurer. So whos ready for a morose drama in which a stone-faced Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) reluctantly treks back to Africa to stop a slavery ring in the 1890s? Samuel L. Jackson and Alexander Skarsgard in The Legend of Tarzan. Jonathan Olley/Warner Bros. Dont call him Tarzan by the way. He goes by the name John Clayton (i.e. the Earl of Greystoke) here. Since leaving the jungle he has forged an aristocratic life as a lord in the British parliament. He sips tea like a gentleman. His loving wife Jane (Margot Robbie) holds down the stately homestead. Then nature calls. In an early scene John is invited back to the Congo to serve as a sort of goodwill ambassador and trade emissary. At first he says no. ""Its hot"" he sneers. An American Civil War soldier turned humanitarian (Samuel L. Jackson looking and sounding like he dropped in from the 1990s) changes his mind pleading with him to come along to expose possible slavery in the land. Alexander Skarsgard Bares His Abs in Legend of Tarzan See the New Shirtless Pictures Little does Tarzan/John/Greystoke know that hes merely a pawn in a game of class warfare. Sinister King of Belgium Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) has promised the tribal chief (Djimon Hounsou) that he will deliver the former jungle boy in exchange for diamonds. Make that diamondzzzzz. With that misguided windup the nodding off might start before Tarzan et al. even step foot in the jungle. A centurys worth of swashbuckling fun has been stripped away. Rom kidnaps Jane. You wont care. Jane fights back. You wont care. Tarzan communicates with gorillas. You wont care. Skarsgard turns into an action hero and teams up with Jackson to fight the bad guys. You wont care. Skarsgard doffs his shirt. You wont care. OK fine. Youll care. But not enough. Margot Robbie as Jane and Alexander Skarsgard in The Legend of Tarzan. Jonathan Olley/Warner Bros. The performances stink up the jungle too as the actors go through the motions with a collective look of pained embarrassment on their faces. Surely Quentin Tarantino will not be pleased that two members of his regular troupe Jackson and Waltz ham it up in a dud. Margot Robbies Beauty Routine Includes Placenta Toner and Cold Spoons It didnt have to be this way. Just three months ago The Jungle Book illustrated how to create a fully immersive and entertaining call-of-the-wild experience. The answer isnt a glum ape-man solving a sinister colonial conspiracy. Though the films budget reportedly ballooned to 180 million an engaging and surprising script always trumps the sight of CGIed wildebeests repeatedly stampeding the land. Without that cinematic magic all that remains is a smattering of laughter and applause when Jackson delivers the most knowing line of the movie ""Can we please just stop this?""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres an air of studio tradition surrounding The Legend Of Tarzan and not just because a revival of the Edgar Rice Burroughs character is a classic executive gambit based on the misconception that audiences hunger for all old stories to be ceaselessly retold. There is that of course but this Warner Bros. production also emits a certain in-house enthusiasm--a summoning of Warner-based talent to take another shot at this Tarzan business. Its directed by once and future Harry Potter wizard David Yates features a posthumous producer credit for Jerry Weintraub (of the Oceans trilogy) and is packed with stars including Margot Robbie who--having filmed this in between Warner productions Focus and Suicide Squad--seems like a studio favorite.In other words theres a handsomeness to the enterprise--a confidence that seems to dissipate or at least diminish as the movie goes on. Maybe the strong start comes from a rush of relief that its not an origin story. The film joins Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) years after marrying Jane (Margot Robbie) and moving to London leaving the jungle behind; hes introduced sipping tea but maintaining a simian curl to his knuckles. Tarzan has reclaimed his identity as John Clayton whose parents were shipwrecked in Africa and eventually killed in the jungle where apes would eventually raise their baby son.Claytons not eager to fulfill a request from the English government to revisit the Congo and assist the money-hemorrhaging king of Belgium. But George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) convinces ""Africas favorite son"" to make the trip to investigate his suspicions of slavery. These suspicions are particularly understandable given that Belgiums primary enforcer Rom is played by Christoph Waltz as another chatty even-keeled evildoer. He has his own reasons for luring Tarzan back to Africa.Jane for her part is less reluctant to revisit her jungle past craving some corset-free adventure. The film works overtime to position Jane as a strong heroine who literally spits at the term ""damsel"" but all of this effort serves only as an extensive justification for her use in that role. Tip to filmmakers endeavoring to undermine cliches Having the damsel in distress escape before the hero rescues her is a decent twist. Having her recaptured shortly thereafter is not. Similarly the movie positions Tarzan and Jane as friends to the African natives and in doing so renders said natives more of a vast collective than a group that might include actual characters with the exception of vengeful Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou).The bad blood between Mbonga and Tarzan is part of the movies bizarre strategy to undermine its intriguing years-later take on Tarzan with a series of sepia-toned flashbacks retelling bits of his origin story albeit more concisely than a full origin movie would have told it. Yet all of the mildly retrograde backsliding in characterization and storytelling doesnt fully damper the movies initial promise of adventure. In the early going The Legend Of Tarzan is pretty fun well-appointed cornball stuff. Yates doesnt really have his own directorial signatures but hes a decent craftsman and lends the visuals some polish and clarity even when the computer-generated effects dont fully measure up. Yates Harry Potter movies tended to emphasize beloved characters over big-ticket action and his direction of their flashiest moments needed only to improve on the sometimes-confusing action blocking from J.K. Rowlings prose. Tarzan at least as played by Skarsgard is more of a physically impressive cipher than a lovable hero which places more importance on his actions--an area where The Legend Of Tarzan falls short. Tarzans vine-swinging never achieves the kind of fluidity seen in the Disney-animated version and two big confrontations take place in front of the same waterfall which through Yates eyes might as well be called Adjusted Shutter-Speed Falls.Without many binding action sequences the movie draws more attention to its shortcomings like the terribly limp banter between Tarzan and Williams who serves as a competent but only semi-comic sidekick. Jackson keeps putting his heart into it as he usually does but Tarzan as a character doesnt lend himself well to playful callbacks to earlier pithy exchanges (especially when said exchanges are not that pithy and said callbacks barely seem to amuse the people on screen). The movie tees up an exciting likable yarn but never really takes off. Yates finally stages a pretty strong action sequence for its climax featuring an animal stampede a hail of 19th-century machine-gun bullets and some impressive Tarzan acrobatics. Unfortunately it arrives too late for the movie to become rip-roaring pulp. Its nice that The Legend Of Tarzan isnt a nakedly mercenary franchise play that presumes dozens of sequels to come. (Its also not a low-rent Casper Van Dien vehicle.) But it sure could use some money-grubbing set pieces to tie the genial silliness together. Share Tweet Filed Under Film Samuel L.

Theres never a moment in this new film that comes off like anyone involved was driven or aching to put a new spin on Tarzan; instead its a reflection of public awareness of the character whose name gets a little registered trademark symbol in the opening and closing credits. If marketing-based decisions didnt sometimes lead to entertaining movies Hollywood would be a ghost town but here we have talented people on both sides of the camera still creating a movie thats painfully rote. See Video Watch Alexander Skarsgard Go Wild in New Legend of Tarzan Trailer Screenwriters Adam Cozad (""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"") and Craig Brewer (""Hustle amp; Flow"") follow the formula of the recent ""Alice in Wonderland"" movies setting the story after the action we know from the books while also indulging in enough flashbacks to make half of the film an origin story. Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) has returned to England to assume his title of the fifth earl of Greystoke but U.S. government agent George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) compels him to travel to Africa on the invitation of the king of Belgium who has sunk vast amounts of money into exploiting the resources of the Congo. That invitation however is a trap - the kings representative Captain Rom (Christoph Waltz) has made a deal that will earn his sovereign a fortune in diamonds but only in return for delivering Tarzan to his enemy Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou). Williams wants to prove that Belgium is enslaving the local populace so Tarzan agrees to go as does his wife Jane (Margot Robbie) who also grew up in Africa. The plotting of this new film from director David Yates (the man behind the last four ""Harry Potter"" films) offers about as much surprise as Waltzs villainous performance; youve seen this all before and you know exactly where its going. Familiarity can be fun when there are other distractions to be enjoyed but apart from a few rousing scenes -- Tarzan and Williams make their way across a tree so huge that you can run on the branches a kidnapped Jane eludes both her captors and a hungry hungry hippo -- ""The Legend of Tarzan"" never really pops. Also Read Biggest Studio Gambles of the Summer From Ghostbusters to Ben-Hur Like ""John Carter"" and ""The Lone Ranger"" before it this movie packs in so much generic derring-do that theres little time to focus on what made the character so memorable in the first place. And on the heels of this years ""Jungle Book"" remake the wild-animal CGI falls a little short as well. (Lets not even dig into the films racial undertones or white-savior story much less the suggestion that the only way to stop a bad colonizer is with a good colonizer.) Yates doesnt serve his cast well Skarsgard doesnt have the literal animal magnetism youd expect (although his torso reveals that His Lordship remained active back in England) Robbie is stuck playing an idea of a character rather than a character and even Jackson is relegated to breathlessly trying to keep up with his fellow good guys. (And wouldnt a black American of the 19th century have some kind of response good or bad about going to Africa for the first time? The movie seems too timid to ask.) See Video Margot Robbie Spoofs American Psycho Opening Scene for Vogue ""The Legend of Tarzan"" isnt as singularly joyless as many of this summers other current offerings but it also feels distinctly like a missed opportunity. Even when Skarsgard offers up the characters famous jungle cry it sounds more mournful than enthusiastic and that sentiment seeps into the entire enterprise. Email 10 Summer Movie Box Office Champs of the Last 10 Summers (Photos) ""Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest"" (Release date July 7 2006) The sequel to the 2003 Disney action adventure was even more commercially successful than its predecessor. Though it didnt receive the same amount of positive reviews ""Dead Mans Chest"" grossed about 423.3 million domestically and 1.06 billion worldwide which helped spawn three more sequels for the franchise.""Spider-Man 3"" (Release date May 4 2007) ""Spider-Man 3"" may not have lived up to the hype of Sam Raimis first two movies in the superhero franchise but it certainly made an impression financially. The third and final outing with Tobey Maguire as the webslinger earned 336.5 million domestically and 890 million worldwide.  ""The Dark Knight"" (Release date July 18 2008) The middle film in Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy featured a memorable Oscar-winning turn by Heath Ledger as the Joker. That boosted box office to an impressive 534.8 million in North America and just over 1 billion worldwide.  ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" (Release date June 24 2009) Poor reviews didnt stop ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" from becoming the highest grossing film of the summer of 2009 (and the second highest that year). The movie grossed 402.1 million domestically and 836 million worldwide.""Toy Story 3"" (Release date June 18 2010) Fifteen years after Pixars beloved classic ""Toy Story"" the films threequel exceeded expectations both critically and commercially. Receiving overwhelming critical praise and two Academy Awards ""Toy Story 3"" skyrocketed at the box office. It grossed 415 million domestically and became the first animated film to top 1 billion worldwide.""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" (Release date July 15 2011) The eighth and final chapter in the epic ""Harry Potter"" film series was a no-brainer success.

TWITTER 7/1/2016 Alexander Skarsgard stars as the vine-swinger raised by apes alongside Margot Robbie Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz in director David Yates new take on the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic. After the creative and financial short-falling of numerous recent big-budget franchise films (the latest tanker Independence Day Resurgence) and the ill fortune Warner Bros. has lately suffered with several expensive intended tentpoles (The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Pan Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice) it comes as something more than a mild surprise that The Legend of Tarzan isnt half-bad; actually its pretty good. Beautifully made and smartly set at the beginning of Belgian King Leopold IIs rapacious colonization of the Congo in the 1880s this is certainly the best live-action Tarzan film in many a decade (which admittedly isnt saying much) and offers a well-judged balance of vigorous action and engaging-enough drama. David Yates first directorial outing since capably overseeing the final four Harry Potter installments (his Potter follow-up Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them opens Nov. 18) looks to swing to brawny mid-summer box-office returns internationally. Edgar Rice Burroughs white boy raised by apes in the African jungle probably starred in as many or more movies than any other fictional character from the dawn of cinema through 1960 after which the vine-swinger was largely relegated to television. Since then big-screen filmmakers have been more uncertain about how to deal with the muscular wild child uncorrupted by society increasingly due to changing attitudes and sensitivities about the depiction of colonialism tribal Africans a white naif saving the day et al. The most financially successful modern take on the tale remains Disneys animated 1999 Tarzan the most serious has been Hugh Hudsons stately Greystoke The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes in 1984 and the most ridiculous was unquestionably John Dereks 1981 Tarzan the Ape Man in which the director was far more interested in photographing his wife Bo in multiple stages of undress than in training his lenses on the title character. Yates and screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer allow no such distractions to get in their way here as they deftly apply Tarzans jungle-learned know-how to the cause of fighting a real historical evil that being Leopolds enslavement of locals and exploitation of his massive new central African colony. At the same time there are certain moments when this feels like a 19th century ancestor of James Bond beginning with the presence of Christoph Waltz as the main villain and abetted by multiple action sequences involving moving vehicles. At its best the film achieves what its makers clearly set out to do to create a sweeping adventure that embraces the old in a new way. Many of the trademark tropes are present giant apes making off with a white baby boy and teaching him the ropes so to speak; the removal of the adult Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) to England to awkwardly assume his position as the wealthy Lord Greystoke; his marriage to beauteous Jane (Margot Robbie); the lure of precious diamonds that attracts unsavory characters to the jungle; and Tarzans eventual fierce defense of his boyhood home and those he and his wife grew up with. Along with the deserved branding of Leopold as the ne plus ultra of colonialist evil the new revisionist aspects also prominently include the presence of a black American ""diplomatic envoy"" George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) in London to persuade Lord Greystoke to accompany him to Africa to find out what Leopolds really up to down there. The writers and director adroitly juggle the tricky job of propelling the main story forward while also sketching in sufficient backstory for Tarzan and Jane. In this telling the latter is a sharp-minded American-accented blonde who like her husband was raised in Africa. Far from being a tag-along wife this Jane is a knowledgeable woman of the world with a deep feeling for the people and culture she grew up with and thanks in part to Robbies spirited performance is probably the most plausible of all the main characters. This is useful since shes the one rather than her husband who ends up a hostage in the hands of Waltzs nasty Leon Rom whose original idea was to lure Tarzan back to Africa with the intention of trading him to a tribal chief (Djimon Hounsou) with a lifelong grudge against Tarzan; in exchange Rom would receive a vast cache of diamonds to help finance Leopolds African exploits. So with a few native companions and the slower-moving Williams in tow Tarzan sees his journey turned into a mission to rescue his wife giving all the participants abundant motivation for their strenuous exertions. During this long middle stretch there are numerous lovely moments involving animals -- lions primates water buffalo elephants crocs and more all of which were computer generated superbly and naturalistically so -- Janes sweet reunion with the villagers who helped raise her and extensive scenes shot on fabulously diverse and hitherto unseen locations in Gabon where the filmmakers spent six weeks. Its a pictorially gorgeous work with particular kudos due to cinematographer Henry Braham and veteran production designer Stuart Craig who ironically performed the same job on Greystoke 30 years ago. The film maintains a vigorous pace through pursuits on a slave train (a major project of Leopolds) and river steamer letting down somewhat only at the climax at a large interior military base and town; given all thats come before the final minutes have a comparatively soft and rote feeling. The other fuzzy point unfortunately is the portrayal of Tarzan both in conception and execution. As Lord Greystoke in England hes stiff and rather out of his element. Once he gets back to Africa he seems more at ease but both the conception and portrayal of the character remain narrow and one-note. Physically Skarsgard is a striking and different sort of ape-man; tall and lithe he carves out a very vertical figure even down to his unusual abs which are cut up-and-down rather than layered horizontally. Hes also good in his African reunion moments. But emotionally he remains remote and uninvolving his eyes face and voice only modestly registering whatever might be going on inside. Jackson playing a former Indian fighter and Civil War veteran gets to proclaim topically modernist lines such as ""Mexico was bad but what we did to the Indians ..."" and ""We aint better than these Belgians"" while Waltz plays his villain with pure cold blood as a man who doesnt even feel he needs to lay on the charm to disguise his evil designs. The top-billed producer here the late Jerry Weintraub started development of this project in 2003 and went through any number of scripts directors (from Guillermo del Toro to Stephen Sommers) and proposed stars (swimmer Michael Phelps Tom Hardy Henry Cavill Charlie Hunnam). Those he and his successors finally settled on to bring Tarzan back to the big screen have done pretty well. Distributor Warner Bros.

The movies first sentence on a title card Frantz Fanon might appreciate tells us that in the late nineteenth century ""the worlds colonial powers took it upon themselves"" to divvy up the Congo.The first scene wittily sends up the opening of Raiders of the Lost Ark with treasure-hunters prowling the verdant bush acting like they own the place. But their leader is Christoph Waltz rather than Harrison Ford and theyre working for wicked King Leopold of Belgium rather than some university museum so by the time theyve run afoul of the indigenous population youre jeering the invaders and probably relishing the prospect of their comeuppance. Director Yates (who handled the last four Harry Potter films) is vigorously imaginative in the moments before violence zooming in on scared white faces the barrel of a rolling machine gun and the ash-coated Congolese warriors in formation atop a waterfall as still and silent as a terra-cotta army.Film Details The Legend of Tarzan RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time110 min. Showing Today In21 Theaters More Info Trailer Eventually Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) shows up with life-and-adventure partner Jane (Margot Robbie) and their new best friend a doctor played by Samuel L. Jackson who may as well be named ""Samuel L. Jackson"" and brightens the movie up early on by saying ""You are Tarzan"" and doing some no-shit jazz hands. The 2016 model is less Lord of the Jungle than Social Jungle Warrior an extravagantly abbed grown-up journeying from his graying British estate -- three mansions piled atop one another -- back to the Congo to investigate rumors of slavery in the jungle and bringing his wife along as a blow against adventure-movie sexism.At first hes reluctant saying ""Ive already seen Africa. Its hot."" This first-act time-killing gives the flashbacks to his jungle youth a chance to catch up to the narratives present. But Jacksons character an American atoning for his nations own sins prevails nudging the idle Lord Greystoke and Lady Jane back into action -- just the thing they need to get over their recent miscarriage. (Uh not every acknowledgment of real-world darkness richens pulp.) EXPAND Warner Bros. There Tarzan and Co. hang with the most warmly depicted native tribe ever to appear in a white-hero jungle flick. The Belgians inevitably come gunning for them and in the films first major fracas something unprecedented occurs that I am totally going to spoil The white hero leaps into the fray to save the tribal chief and is immediately trussed and bound by the bad guys until American rifleman Samuel L. Jackson storms in and saves his ape-raised ass. Thats the first of several humblings that make this Tarzan the most interesting take on the character since Philip Jose Farmer in the 1969 novel A Feast Unknown made him and Doc Savage sword-fight with their own hard-ons. Here Tarzan gets into a one-on-one duel with a gorilla and accepts what that bear in The Revenant taught Leonardo DiCaprio Sometimes you just gotta take a beating. (Thats also what The Revenant taught audiences.) The fights are quick and brutal and bloodless with too much slo-mo and sped-up stuff and some clever camera angles that get cut from before you can work out what youre looking at.Much better are the buildups the fingers on triggers or the humans going still before the convincingly wild CGI beasts. These scenes often touch that awed Spielbergian pleasure-terror that Jurassic World fumbled. The movies got more critter-treats than a box of animal crackers The tigers snuffle Tarzan happy to see him again; the hippos bob fearsomely in a beautiful/terrible river; and in the climax the water buffalo and the crocodiles and who knows what else just keep coming only a hair less ridiculous than when the Marx Brothers pinned down in Duck Soup call for help -- and are rewarded with a relentless reel of hurrying-animal stock footage.For all its high-mindedness the movie is also agreeably ripe indulging in sweaty-pec close-ups Spider-Man-style vine-swinging romantic clinches that look like re-creations of Harlequin paperback covers a villain who uses rosary beads as something like a bullwhip and a gush of PG-13 Sam Jackson-isms some for the ages ""Why is it people dont ride zebras?"" he asks. ""Damn thats one odious aroma"" he declares. And will he ever top ""Snakes good meat -- I aint eating no damn ant""?The story grounded in historical tragedy still honors the outline of Burroughss tales no matter all its revisionism Jane gets kidnapped by diamond-hungry white folks representing a civilization less civilized than the jungle cultures and Tarzan sets out after her. She has her agency contriving escape attempts much like Karen Allens Raiders toughie but its hard to argue that there are any women-in-Hollywood breakthroughs when the heroine is handcuffed for so much of the running time.Its Jackson who gets the biggest surprise. With Jane out of the picture its his character who has to tend to the shirtless heros wounds. As they recover he offers up a quick monologue about post-Civil War America that sums up in a minute or so what took Quentin Tarantino three hours in The Hateful Eight Jacksons character signed up with the federal government to fight Native Americans and hes not proud of it. Sitting there in the jungle having patched up the flesh of the character who has long seemed our cultures most absurd fantasy of white power Jacksons character observes that what the U.S. did aint no better than what King Leopold was up to. This Tarzan like Django Unchained before it makes a hell of a case for pulp fiction.The Legend of Tarzan Directed by David Yates Warner Bros.

A talky and mostly turgid attempt by British director David Yates to build on the epic vision he brought to the final four Harry Potter movies via another beloved literary hero ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is sequel origin story and racially sensitive revisionist history lesson all in one. What it isnt is much fun for anyone whos seen Edgar Rice Burroughs ape man in any of his previous incarnations. While name recognition alone should snare a fair number of those who prefer their pulp heroes endowed with superpowers between this and last years ""Pan"" evidence suggests Warner Bros. ought to leave the live-action reboots to Disney. For a film the scale of Yates ""The Legend of Tarzan""  the visual effects are astonishingly subpar obliging the creative team to distract us with such impressive topographical sights as the African savannah and Alexander Skarsgards abs. The latter selling point doesnt appear until nearly midway through the movie until which point Adam Cozad and Craig Brewers script is concerned primarily with getting Tarzan back to Africa -- a prospect his beloved Jane (a semi-empowered Margot Robbie) far prefers to days spent ""hybridizing coconuts and playing ping pong."" While choppy action-oriented flashbacks retrace the feral childs formative years in the wild it seems the one-time vine-swinger has grown up and re-gentrified in rainy old England where he has traded his loincloth for a dapper pair of pants and assumed his identity as John Clayton III fifth earl of Greystoke and member of the House of Lords. Covering his protagonist in scars (a superficial gesture toward realism) Yates has attempted to give us a more psychologically complex Tarzan -- which is to say he serves up a version of the character that shamelessly emulates the ""why so serious"" tone of Christopher Nolans brooding Batman movies. Skarsgard plays Clayton as a pampered rich kid haunted by his parents deaths who feels compelled to protect others. The main difference is the fact that everybody knows his secret identity which makes it rather easy for the films villain Capt. Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz in yet another of his suave sociopath roles just a few degrees removed from the well-mannered Nazi officer he played in ""Inglourious Basterds"") to invent a pretext that will lure Tarzan to the Congo where Rom plans to deliver him to vengeful tribal chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou) in exchange for the sought-after diamonds of Opar. Inadvertently helping to pull off Roms plan is another Tarantino regular Samuel L. Jackson who may as well be riffing on his score-settling ""The Hateful Eight"" character. Jackson plays George Washington Williams a veteran of the American Civil War (and a real historical figure) who suspects that Belgian king Leopold II may be enslaving -- or at least condoning the enslavement of -- the natives of his colony in the Congo. Having fought to help end slavery in the United States Williams has now set out to stanch the practice at its source enlisting Tarzan (who frankly seems more interested in the fate of the gorilla family that raised him) to restore some sense of balance to the region. Williams makes an intriguing addition to the formula as does the decision to peg this particular Tarzan adventure to the Congo which isnt necessarily the backdrop Burroughs had in mind. (Situating it there does allow the film to make a more impactful commentary on Europes controversial relationship with the Dark Continent.) To the extent that white men have exploited Africa for more than two centuries Tarzan comes to represent the extension -- a hero who identifies with the natives and stands up to the corrupt white men who refuse to respect their lives liberty or potential claim to their own natural resources. The film establishes Roms villainy early on via a scene of disturbingly cold-blooded genocide as the Belgian officer gives the go-ahead for his Force Publique soldiers to gun down locals armed only with spears (although like Tarzan Yates seems more interested in the fate of the gorilla family later in the film). The historical figure on whom Rom is based was notoriously cruel to African natives -- it was he who inspired the character of Col. Kurtz in ""Heart of Darkness."" Dressed in white linen and armed with only a deadly rosary made from Madagascar spider silk Rom gets the fate Hollywood feels he deserves which includes a homophobic barb from Jane that flies right over the characters head (""Sounds like you and your priest were really close""). The role of Tarzan is unique among Western heroes in that he requires virtually no acting ability (as bodybuilder Miles OKeeffe and Calvin Klein model Travis Fimmel both demonstrated). And yet with each subsequent screen appearance the bar is raised on how perfect audiences expect the characters wildly unnatural physique to be. In that respect Skarsgard makes a fine choice for the role looking more than ever like someones fantasy PhotoShop rendering of father Stellans head grafted onto an impossibly shredded torso -- which isnt so far removed from the process the visual effects team used to meld his face onto an all-CG body during scenes when Tarzan swings through the trees at top speed. To the extent that modern audiences accept the character as a sort of proto-superhero Tarzans ""powers"" rank way down there with those of Aquaman Hes super-strong agile and can speak to animals having mastered the mating calls of nearly every African species. Whenever Tarzan shares the screen with animals however the critters look appallingly digital -- with human actors not even bothering to look in the right direction much of the time (consider the scene when Mbongas men are surrounded by gorillas reacting as if to invisible ghosts). Its a glaring problem given all the attention Yates poured into crafting a believable context for what amounts to a glorified B movie. As a brand Burroughs hero has always been schlocky and no amount of psychological depth or physical perfection can render him otherwise -- especially if the filmmakers cant swing a convincing interaction between Tarzan and his animal allies. That dynamic -- along with his full-throated yodel -- has always been Tarzans trademark but in this relatively lifeless incarnation it simply doesnt register.

Phil says July 17 2016 at 400 pm My wife and I were both entertained. Having grown up with Tarzan in our lives it was refreshing and enjoyable. There was violence but not full of gore like so many movies are today. We also enjoyed the fact that there was no swearing for a change. It was quirky yes but enjoyable with some humour also. We wont be having any nightmares over this film. Recommended pleasant enjoyable. Reply Adam H-J says July 16 2016 at 828 am I appreciate everyone who has defended this movie its one of the best I have ever seen already planning a 4th n 5th visit before it leaves theaters. Reply Tarzan says July 11 2016 at 123 am Big Tarzan fan here. I read the novel a few times loved ""Greystoke The Legend of Tarzan"" (the definitive Tarzan flick for me) and even dug the Johnny Weissmuller movies as a kid but man the new movie... meh.The new ""The Legend of Tarzan"" (not to be confused with the Greystoke movie) is just not that great. The True Blood guy is great in the roll of Tarzan. Hes a good actor anyway. Reply Georgianna Natale says July 6 2016 at 945 am I thought the movie was excellent Had me interested from beginning to end. Of course Im familiar with the story-memories include Johnny Weissmuller when I was a child and others who played this role since then. A fantasy which allows one to escape reality for 110 minutes. I love movies--all types; am a regular moviegoer and this did not disappoint. Reply Diane Gunderson says July 8 2016 at 251 pm Totally agree I am so glad I did not listen to the critics on this film. Enjoyed it from beginning to end. Like you I am a regular movie goer and I agree no disappointment here Reply vipin says July 6 2016 at 121 am i really enjoyed this movie. though the story was happening a century ago it was nice watching. Reply loupizzuti says July 5 2016 at 700 am Its a pity that the author has never read any of the source material but rather relies on Hollywood revisionist crap for his frame of reference. In point of fact the scenes portraying the backstory are lifted almost directly from the novel ""Tarzan of the Apes"". The Belgian imperialism in the Congo is a constant theme in the novels. The same could be said of Janes abduction by Rom. The only signficant difference in the movie from ERBs original conception is Janes backstory. This alternative is believable and the inclusion of the original backstory would have taken away from the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it as I expect would be the case with anyone who has read the novels. Thumbs up for the movie and a big raspberry for the review. Reply Tina Grossman says July 4 2016 at 709 pm Really Mr. Debruge?? I just returned from seeing the movie. I was a huge Tarzan fan in my youth. Born 1948. This movie did not disappoint. I loved it Missed Cheetah tough. It told the story well and was seamless in blending the past with the present. It met with all my expectations. drama a bit of humor and action. The story was well told. Not the mundane silly crap we see a lot of nowadays. Reply rbindia2014 says July 3 2016 at 535 am You really are a thorough idiot Mr Debruge. Monsieur Jean Tarzan is supposed to be in fancy pants at the start of the second novel in the 24 novel series by Edgar Burroughs. He is also supposed to be one of grim demeanour and astonishing physical strength. Infact Mr Burroughs talks at length about the size of Tarzans arm muscles in the book Return of Tarzan. So the casting is apt and of course there have been liberties taken with the storyline. But it is a fine story thay Yates team have spun with a fair share of political intrigue and racial context. You should just go take your paycheck home and read the book. Maybe they will still let you thumb down well made movies that recreate literary heroes with sincerity. Reply Jack Monte says July 3 2016 at 445 pm Very true. Petey must have missed all the Iron Man suits flying around and bland cinematography of Disney superhero movies. In 2016 has he not seen a behind the scenes or making of footage? Its not the actors fault if they dont appear to be looking at a digital effect its the animators. And in the scene hes talking about the tribe looks all over because there are surrounded. Also go back to high school and take a real history class many slaves were sold to the British by the rulers of the villages not stolen but we wouldnt want to have to talk about blacks harming blacks. The kind of horrible review that usually come from little Owen G. Reply Dan D says July 3 2016 at 118 pm Superb comment I concur completely. Reply Taylor Phillips says July 2 2016 at 1119 pm I saw the film this afternoon and enjoyed it. Im disappointed in this review but it looks like the film simply was not what the reviewer was hoping it would be. It appears as though the reviewer was expecting to see a clone of the Marvel or DC offerings this summer. Tarzan is not a ""super"" hero as much as he is an adventure hero and Skarsgard is good in the role. Margot Robbie does play Jane as an empowered heroine. Even though she is captured she shows she is still smart brave and capable as she banters with Leon Rom and I liked that she did not fall into the modern-day cliche of a female action hero once she frees herself. The multiple subplots are not as developed as they could have been but the movie as a whole is good summertime escapist fun. Reply Nix says July 4 2016 at 724 am I agree about wanting a bit more subplot buildup. It would have given more substance to a pretty darn good fun movie overall. I wonder if Warner Bros (as studios are so money oriented that they shoot themselves in the foot many times over) got cold feet about the budget and panicked and cut it short? Usually I love critic reviews because I like indie films and what some call ""artsy high brow"" films too but many critics imo forget and screw over as Roger Ebert used to put it... the Good Watch Movie. Word of mouth by the viewer has been good. To me that says it all. Some of the negatives Ive read pertains to preconceived opinions of who Tarzan should be. Thats mighty hard to overcome. Such as Tarzans appearance? Personally I loved Skarsgard. His movements were fluid and animal like. Tarzans yell? Loved that too. More natural imo. Tarzans speaks? Skarsgard switched between civilized English to animal like grunts as he moved between worlds. His performance was maybe more subtle than other Tarzans in the past. A lot was in the eyes. Reply Dan D says July 3 2016 at 123 pm I agree completely on the character development and script. I thought the acting was very good believable entirely. As to subplots perhaps you are correct but there is only so much can be crammed in a 2 hour movie and there was already quite a bit to work in. Seems the best Tarzan movie ever by far to me. Reply Rey says July 2 2016 at 1238 am I just watched the movie and it was great. Your critics got it all wrong and I doubt he has even watched this movie. Shame on him. Reply Dan D says July 1 2016 at 1038 pm These movie reviewers are disgusting. They slam films that they do not understand. And then they praise the most sleazy horrific stuff as good movie making. I read all the Tarzan books as a youngster back in the late 1960s. Edgar Rice Burroughs created some of the first superheroes and later creators owe much of their superhero characters development to his pioneer trailblazing and many have commented as much. What is so terrible about an attempt to bring the novels to life on the screen. This reviewer views the film through a ""lens"" of liberal 21st Century bias that blinds him. And all this criticism of CGI special effects is pure baloney All the effects looked super to me. There has never been a film of Tarzan that in any way successfully presented the dynamic of the character in the books. Until this one. And it is a tremendous extremely well-acted as believable as possible film (for this story and character) with an excellent script. For an action film depicting the character Tarzan it is a masterpiece - true to the books and true to the character. It includes the origins and the emotional bonding of the characters very well. In the books Tarzan evolves from an animalistic savage and then becomes a brilliant multi-lingual cunning sophisticated man who can switch back and forth from the most cultured to the most savage according to the situation. Not a bumbling ""Me Tarzan you Jane"" one dimensional character as in prior films. Do not let the critics scare you off. The film is very well-done and for some reason the critics want it to fail. And as for those who criticize this film as racist in the showing I attended about 1/2 the audience was African American and they seemed to love it. (It certainly provided a huge amount of employment for black actors and they were all very good.) The African blacks are portrayed as brave dynamic and with powerful personalities and there is no hint of racism in Tarzan or Jane only respect (considering a film period-based in the 1880s such respect from an Englishman would be exceptional). If you want to see racism punched in the face then this is the film for you (Additionally the film story is built on the historically factual exploitative enslavement of the Congo Africans by King Leopold II of Belgium; apparently this reviewer is completely ignorant of that information.) These critics are superficial who have no respect for the history of an impacting series of novels that blazed a trail for superheroes who followed. It is a joy to see an amazing action story you loved brought to the screen in such a genuinely authentic effort. Reply Richardson says July 1 2016 at 823 am You obviously have never read one of the original Tarzan novels. Reply blumemoritz says July 1 2016 at 815 am i was very surprised that i loved the tarzan movie i thought it was awesome even though i loved the disney tarzan and this movie is very different. you dont see adventure movies like these anymore. this movie is not perfect but i was still very pleasantly surprised. i would have loved to see the origin story but this movie is still great. Reply Don VanAusdoll says June 30 2016 at 1131 pm I confess to not having seen the film yet. I do know Tarzan. A lot of the criticisms here seem to tell me this may be one of the best Tarzan movies to date. Tarzan has always put his ""family"" first whether its Jane the mangani or the Wizari. Tarzan held little respect for those who would bend a knee and give up something as important as freedom for something as pitiful as a life of servitude.Death is preferable in his mind. John Clayton is the Earl of Greystoke and after the second novel refers to himself as such with pride. Though he is also Tarzan. He introduces himself by whichever title he feels will easiest win him the trust of the speaker. As for acting skills how much harder is it to portray a role with few lines where only body language and facial expressions carry the bulk of the weight? I doubt this reviewer has seen more than the two Tarzan movies he references and will virtually guarantee hes never made it past chapter two of any of the novels. Reply Ed Wyrd says June 30 2016 at 456 pm The reviewer keeps calling them ""gorillas."" Thats so cute. Im surprised he didnt say ""What? No Cheeta?"" Reply Dan D says July 3 2016 at 141 pm Right on. As to your last comment not to worry another ignorant ""pro"" critic did at the Tampa Bay news. Reply lulu says June 30 2016 at 207 pm Review is too verbose and densely empty.....cant follow what hes saying or describing. Rather ....gets side tracked into descriptions of descriptions of descriptions. Ill see the movie for myself and swoon...Thank you. Reply Veris Perovich says July 3 2016 at 616 pm Totally agree and by the way...swoon you will. Reply John Small says June 30 2016 at 1015 am Say heres a novel idea Perhaps the reviewer should take the time to familiarize himself with the original source materials - the actual Edgar Rice Burroughs novels - instead of lamely comparing this movie to ""previous incarnations"" in movies that were nothing like what ERB wrote (Miles OKeefe? really?) or making inane comparisons to (of all characters) Aquaman. I have yet to see the movie myself yet (I have tickets for Saturday) but this is what I do know the family of Edgar Rice Burroughs has gone on record as saying this movie is closer to what ERB wrote than any that have come before. Personally I put a great deal more stock in that reaction than in a review written by someone who apparently has never read any of the books. (By the way that ""full-throated yodel"" you mentioned - a product of Hollywood NOT the original books.) Reply Dan D says July 3 2016 at 137 pm Great comment Very few of ""pro"" critics seem to have read the books and keep referring to ""the Tarzan we know"" as the cartoon Tarzan or the Johnny Weissmuller old movies. As to your last sentence I thought the Tarzan call in this film did some justice to the ""blood-curdling scream"" in the novels which of course was completely a product of ERBs imagination since his mangani were not gorillas but something far more fierce intelligent and dangerous. Reply gmatusk says June 30 2016 at 1211 am I intend to see the film. The original novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs could serve as a masterclass in vivid descriptive action writing and it seems clear that the critic either never read the 1912 novel or never profited from reading it. I studied writing under someone who write many of the teleplays of the TV ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" series and he admired the skill with which the original Tarzan novel was written. The novel was recently republished in a fine edition by the Library of America in honor of its centenary -- will anything written by the critic be read 100 years from now? From the previews that I saw it seems that the present film version is an attempt to pay tribute to the original novel and to avoid the the Johnny Weissmuller grunting monosyllabic depiction of Tarzan. Reply gmatusk says June 30 2016 at 1215 am Correction  ""someone who write"" should be ""someone who wrote."" Reply tim says June 29 2016 at 315 pm The most racist series in Hollywood History Tarzan. When will it stop. And how does it get green lit Reply Molar says June 30 2016 at 912 pm Racist... why because Tarzan is white? Sure lets make him black. I am sure a movie about a black man living in the jungle in dirt and mud in a loin cloth eating raw meat screaming like an animal and ripping peoples throats out would be absolutely loved by the black community. Reply Dan D says July 3 2016 at 128 pm Thanks for your reply it made me laugh out loud reading it. You nailed it. I doubt ""tim"" has seen the film. In the showing I attended about 1/2 the audience was African American and they seemed to love it. (It certainly provided a huge amount of employment for black actors and they were all very good.) To me the African blacks are portrayed as brave dynamic and with powerful personalities and there is no hint of racism in Tarzan or Jane only respect (considering a film period-based in the 1880s such respect from an Englishman would be exceptional). This Tarzan and Jane seems entirely colorblind. Jason says June 29 2016 at 219 pm I think the phrase ""The Dark Continent"" should be retired. Surprised to see a racist term in a 2016 film review. Reply Chuck White says June 29 2016 at 544 pm Victiorian nickname. It referred to the fact that little was known in the West about the interior of the continent. Has nothing to do with race. Reply Nasir says June 29 2016 at 1212 pm Ash said rightly Tarzan was a super hero in the world of jungles and animals and was an activist against slavery . l m 45 years old and still read ERBs Tarzan books but it seems critic hasnt read any book of Tarzan after watching the trailers and other clips related to the film not just me but my friends also commented that at last Hollywood succeeded in to bring the Tarzan in his true invoironment on cinema screen if compared to previous movies this latest version shows that we are actually watching what Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote a hundred years ago. A good writer have the ability to transform his imagination to that of his reader thats exectly what director David Yates has done to the viewers. Reply BillUSA says June 29 2016 at 1130 am Looks like this film will meet its end like George of the Jungle did in the cartoon intro. Reply John schmosess says June 29 2016 at 1112 am Actually the film is fun. This review is wrong. Reply Ash Nazg says June 29 2016 at 949 am Sounds like a missed opportunity. The literary Tarzan is essentially a superhero. Not only is he strong fast and agile he more or less speaks with and commands respect from many animals and he also speaks several human languages. Most of the TV and theatrical depictions of Tarzan are pretty far off base. Of course theres also the inherent racism in the original stories that Tarzan attained his abilities and knowledge mostly through the virtue of his aristocratic white heritage. But modern storytelling should be able to reframe the character into someone more suitable for todays audiences. I was hoping this film might be a start for that. Reply patrik says June 29 2016 at 858 am Margot Robbie- is the most charming Jane Reply Mark says June 29 2016 at 849 am The character of Tarzan doesnt resonate with anyone under 75 years of age are there enough over 75 years olds out there who are willing to see this film twice to make it profitable...dont think so. This is a bit like trying to reboot the old ""Blondie"" film franchise. Just because something ""was"" really popular and profitable doesnt mean it will be again. Reply bOb Owen says July 4 2016 at 417 pm Mark you seem to think of this new Tarzan film as a reboot of the old Tarzan films. Actually this a complete departure from those quaint old films. Completely different from anything done before. Reply Dan D says July 3 2016 at 205 pm Well Im under 75 and I plan to watch it several times in IMAX 3D. The CGi was far more realistic than Avatar and that was not condemned by ""pro"" critics. I doubt you have even seen the film. And it would not matter since your mind is made up in advance. Interestingly there were about 1/2 African Americans in attendance at the showing I went to. And they seemed to love it. The African blacks were powerful and courageous loyal and inventive. And Tarzan and Jane and their African black friends treated each other as family. And the racists got slammed in the end. This film is actually as anti-racist as any ever. It is set as a period history film in the late 1880s so why does that automatically cancel it as unviewable. Reply nbtx says June 29 2016 at 831 am Please tell me who thought this was a good idea? Reply Jane says June 29 2016 at 827 am Scarsgaard in a quietly fierce emotionally available man torn between two identies. His arc is that in the end he chooses himself. Robbie/Jane is a contemporary heroine standing on her own with strong will and deep compassion and understanding- Jane is an inspiration for all young girls today. Waltz is a true demented villain delighting in the pain of others. Sam Jackson s sense of humors brings a reality and balance to a devastating story of slavery. Yates captures the relationship between Tarzan and the animals between man and the animals as Burroughs intended. TARZAN is storytelling at its finest the most romantic heroic and entertaining film Ive seen in years. A+ SEEIT  JUDGEFORYOURSELF ignorebittercritics Reply Dan D says July 3 2016 at 153 pm Thanks Jane for an excellent reply to a shallow biased review. I think you are exactly correct that this Jane is an inspiration and role model. The entire romance and commitment between Tarzan and Jane in this movie shows far more depth and intensity than is often seen in such action films. There are some fine character models in this film. And I enjoyed the absence of much profanity (perhaps as true to the period setting). The acting seemed superbly suited within the context of a classic tale that is admittedly a fantasy that could not occur in real life. No human could do all the things that Tarzan does. But he is only a bit beyond reality as opposed to the Marvel and DC superheroes. Perhaps this is too intense for elementary children but many seem to be watching far worse movies these days. Reply John Michaels says June 29 2016 at 1021 am Margot spends 80% of the movie chained up or running a few witty comebacks dont make her anything special. Reply Nix says July 4 2016 at 708 am Jane doesnt get tied up until at least a quarter in to the movie but the biggest B.S. on calling out the old stereotype of ""damsel in distress"" is Tarzan didnt rescue her off the boat the first time. Jane herself saw an opportunity to escape and took it while saving the life of the tribesman in the cage. The only eye roll stereotype I saw (and I almost wonder if it was added for the eye roll element) was Jane stumbling and falling while running away. Rex says June 29 2016 at 913 am Did you type that with one hand? Reply BillUSA says June 29 2016 at 802 am Imagination like talent is a scarcity in Hollywood - which doesnt say much for movie-goers. Reply Dan D says July 3 2016 at 210 pm BillUSA I doubt if you have seen the movie. And your mind is made up in advance anyway. For those who think that Tarzan and Edgar Rice Burroughs novels are inherently bad the verdict is pre-determined. But for those who would like to see the novels brought to life on the screen this is a reputable effort.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 29 2016 at 900 AM updated June 29 2016 at 904 AM comments Well the long wait is over - a new live-action Tarzan movie is finally in theaters. Wait -- you were waiting werent you? Honestly Id be surprised if you were. The last big-studio live-action attempt to bring back Edgar Rice Burroughs hero - 1984s ""Greystoke The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes"" - was a muddled mess. Disneys 1999 cartoon was hardly memorable. And if you saw the 1981 version ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" - with Bo Derek as a mostly naked Jane - well Im sorry. MORE A few words with Samuel L. Jackson So by now youd figure that Hollywood would have learned that the old story- with its barely disguised racial stereotypes and imperialist politics - was about as revival-ready as the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu. But apparently they didnt get the message. The box-office reaction to this bust of a blockbuster should send it loud and clear. It all gets off to a bad start as not sure whether or not we need to hear the origin story again the movie tries to have it both ways - first involving us in a new Tarzan adventure then regularly (if unnecessarily) slipping into flashbacks. So we get a scene of the grown Anglicized Tarzan - now the fabulously rich Lord Greystoke - accepting a government assignment to go back to Africa. Then we go back to Africa first to see how the orphaned English baby was raised by gorillas. Then we see that Greystoke has stepped into a Congolese trap set by the brutal Belgian government. Then we get more baby pictures of Tarzan and his hairy family. The script seems to be working hard to keep us interested but the irony is that all the leaping around only ends up being a bore. You never get a chance to feel a stake in in either narrative while other touches - a hint of religious mania in the villain - go unexplored. Nor are the lead actors much help. As Tarzan Alexander Skarsgard has a torso that looks like it was sculpted out of marble; too bad his performance is just as stony even when embracing Margot Robbies Jane. (This is the kind of movie that manages to get him half-naked her soaking wet and still fail to create any erotic tension.) But then there are a number of wasted opportunities here and wasted actors (Samuel L. Jackson is a watered-down version of his usual self as an African-American diplomat while Christoph Waltz bad guy isnt much more than smiles and simpers). Theres briefly some real on-screen authority courtesy of Djimon Hounsou as a tribal chief with a grudge; the African landscapes when we get them (most of the film was actually shot on English soundstages) are unlike the film full of power and majesty. But theres so much green-screen and CGI (there isnt a real animal in the entire film) it starts to make the old Disney cartoon look like a nature documentary and the story is so badly structured it drags out every scene shoehorning in spectacles for no good reason. At the end a herd of wildebeest even stampede rushing madly away trampling everything underfoot until they jump into the ocean. I knew how they felt. Ratings note The film contains violence mild sensuality and some vulgar language. The Legend of Tarzan (PG-13) Warner Bros. (109 min.) Directed by David Yates. With Alexander Skarsgard Margot Robbie.

David Ehrlich Jun 29 2016 900 am davidehrlich Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""The Legend of Tarzan"" ""No one ever started with less."" The only interesting detail about the phenomenally uninteresting hero of ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is a stray observation that ""No one ever started with less."" On the contrary The film completely glosses over its namesakes evolution from poop-flinging jungle hunk to tea-stirring British Lord. Separately that throwaway line is vaguely applicable to the film itself. Whereas upcoming tentpoles like ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Jason Bourne"" will enjoy the momentum afforded to them by their respective franchises ""The Legend of Tarzan"" -- despite centering on an Edgar Rice Burroughs character whos almost as old as movies themselves -- could hardly have less going for it. Most 180 million movies have running starts but this one is a 747 trying to take off with only 50 feet of runway. Tarzan is no stranger to the silver screen (the character was created during the rise of early cinema and his name has appeared in the titles of more than 200 different movies during the last 100 years) but the idea of a mega-budget movie about him feels faintly ridiculous in 2016. It shouldnt -- the notion of a beefy guy raised by apes is no sillier than that of a billionaire who dresses like a bat in order to fight a clown -- but theres a world of difference between a universal icon and a marketable modern brand. Theres a whiff of desperation about pulling a literary figure like Tarzan down from the tree line and forcing him to live at our level -- its why youve been laughing at the marketing of this film for months. And now the finished product is finally here and it earns the worst of your preconceptions reintroducing Edgar Rice Burroughs immortal character as just another overpriced commodity. Attempting to split the difference between an origin story and a post-myth reinvention ""The Legend of Tarzan"" begins in the twilight of the 19th Century eight years after its hero emerged from the jungles of Africa and became one of Londons most famous young aristocrats (apparently it was a lot easier for someone without a passport to immigrate from the Congo before Brexit). Now a proper gentleman who goes by the name of John Clayton III the Vine star formerly known as Tarzan (a shredded vacuous Alexander Skarsgard) has assimilated into high society with the help of his feisty wife Jane (Margot Robbie once again stealing a film away from its male lead) but the call of the wild still rings in his ears. Needless to say John is powerless to resist an invitation to return to Africa as a trade emissary of the House of Commons even if hes as confused about the purpose of the trip as we are. While the plot winds up being simple as can be -- Tarzan has to rescue Jane from evil Belgian Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz per usual) whos using slave labor to mine a shit-ton of rare diamonds -- its convoluted beyond coherence by unclear stakes and the hot mess of needless flashbacks that rob the film of any discernible flow. ""The Legend of Tarzan""Warner Bros. Director David Yates (who took over the Harry Potter franchise after the fourth movie and steered it to completion) certainly knows a thing or two about how to make the most of a hero he meets in media res but his Tarzan is a monumental bore. The script written by Adam Cozad and ""Hustle amp; Flow"" mastermind Craig Brewer denies its subject anything that could be mistaken for a character arc -- John is itching to revisit the jungle and then he does. Skarsgard is saddled with maybe 50 lines of dialogue and none of them match the depth of the trenches around his abs. Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps was supposedly in talks to play Tarzan at one point and the role feels as though it were written to accommodate his talents. Theres some somber talk early on about how he and Jane have recently lost a child but that tragic footnote never takes root in the story or expresses itself through any of the action. Jane meanwhile doesnt even need saving. Smart and spunky and brimming with the can-do charisma that has helped launch Robbie into the stratosphere this Jane is no damsel (""Im no damsel"" she tells Rom succinctly exhausting her nuances). But as nice as it is that the character has been updated for the 21st Century the way this film uses her is decidedly archaic. READ MORE Margot Robbie Parodies American Psycho Morning Routine For Vogue Still Jane is a virtuosic revelation compared to Rom as Waltzs shit-eating shtick is so tired that his performance dissolves in front of your eyes. Only Jackson whose George Washington Williams is loosely based on a historical figure of the same name manages to stir any interest; theres real weight to the notion of a late 19th Century black man traversing the world in order to weed out slavery wherever it rears its head but Yates reduces him to a limp sliver of comic relief (it would be wrong to describe the film as humorless but so few of the jokes land that it soon starts to seem that way). Colonialist overtones aside ""The Legend of Tarzan"" could easily be mistaken for any of the generic entry-level superhero movies that have been made in the last 10 years. And make no mistake this Tarzan is most definitely a superhero -- he has extraordinary abilities (he dragged his knuckles around as a kid altering their bone structure in a way that naturally allows him to move through the trees like an ape) he engages in weightless and chaotic fight sequences with hordes of faceless henchmen and he fights a villain who has no hope of being taken seriously amidst such a clamor of bad CG. Whatever magic brought ""The Jungle Book"" to life just a few months ago is missing here as a third act stampede featuring hundreds of rampaging animals feels like a cheap copy-and-paste job. Its maddening to see this degree of sameness plague a movie about a character as singular and iconic as Tarzan -- there isnt even that much vine-swinging Yates who showed so much promise with his Potter films (and returns to that cinematic universe with this falls spin-off ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"") fails to put his stamp on this one though a plethora of gorgeous aerial shots indicate a sincere attempt to capture the splendor of the Congo. Dont be fooled by the lack of spandex ""The Legend of Tarzan"" turns the Lord of the Apes into just another superhero the newest movie about fictions greatest wild man memorable only for the dull irony of how housebroken it feels. Grade D+ ""The Legend of Tarzan"" opens in theaters on Friday.

(July 1 2016) Comments Alange June 29 2016 1002 am For the record Brexit which was voted on less than one week ago hasnt taken effect yet and probably wont for another two years. Reply Jane June 29 2016 1110 am WRONG Scarsgaard in a quietly fierce emotionally available man torn between two identies. His arc is that in the end he chooses himself. Robbie/Jane is a contemporary heroine standing on her own with strong will and deep compassion and understanding- Jane is an inspiration for all young girls today. Waltz is a true demented villain delighting in the pain of others. Sam Jackson s sense of humors brings a reality and balance to a devastating story of slavery. Yates captures the relationship between Tarzan and the animals between man and the animals as Burroughs intended. TARZAN is clearly not for you but it is storytelling at its finest the most romantic heroic and entertaining film Ive seen in years. A+ SEEIT  JUDGEFORYOURSELF a long time Reply Jack June 29 2016 930 pm ""SEE IT JUDGE FOR YOURSELF""??? HILARIOUS Really??? OK PAY FOR MY TICKET Film reviews are for intelligent people (non drones) who make up their own minds on whether or not to pay hard earned money Reply Veronica June 29 2016 1134 am This is not a good review. Essentially the reviewer did not like it because its not PC and the fact that Tarzan isnt portrayed as he has been since the days of Weismuller. The parallels of Tarzan as a superhero are correct. Since Burroughs wrote him as being the idealized British male who is over come adversity and come out stronger and better. Reply James M. June 29 2016 347 pm Alexander Skarsgard shirtless. I dont understand whats so difficult about this? Reply Austen June 29 2016 845 pm Sounds like this movie uses the idea of white patriarchal capitalism to keep white men in power positions of the film whether it is leading the apes or leading the slaves. Also uses the reverse male gaze to appeal to the female audience by showing Tarzans body off. Its good to see that it isnt one of those ""damsel in distress"" films where the entire movie is just the male protagonist fighting through obstacles to save the love interest. Also uses tokenism in with Samuel L. Jackson playing a more important role in the film to make it seem less racist with the hero love interest and villain all being white. Reply Guest July 6 2016 502 am Go see it for yourself before jumping to conclusions. Reply David July 6 2016 501 am Really good movie. Truly enjoyed it.

It imagines Viscount Greystoke (Alexander Skarsgard) best known as chest-beater Tarzan all grown-up and civilised after a childhood in the jungle raised by apes. Its the 1880s and Greystoke is back in the African Congo as a trade emissary for the British government and facing down colonial skullduggery. The film plays as an old-school historical action-adventure with lots of animal attacks and jungle chases and plenty of distracting flashbacks to answer questions about Tarzans complicated backstory. Still it might leave you scratching your head with a few questions of your own like where does Greystoke buy his shaving razors in the wilds? And more importantly which jungle gym does he visit to work on those freakishly sculpted and very twenty-first-century abs? (Not that fans of Skarsgard will worry too much about that.) Directed by Harry Potter stalwart David Yates this Tarzan tries hard to be more than a creaky adventure story. It gives Tarzans other half Jane (Margot Robbie) the voice of a twentieth-century feminist - not exactly credible but very welcome - and pays some attention to the exploitation of indigenous peoples and the pilfering of natural resources. The most lively performances come from Christoph Waltz preening and over-cooked as a colonial villain (an envoy of the Belgian King Leopold) and Samuel L Jackson as George Washington Williams a real-life critic of Belgian imperialism in the Congo who is awkwardly shoe-horned into this movies comic-book plot. Skarsgard himself is fairly bland as Greystoke delivering a po-faced Byronic spin on the character all velvet coats and dreamy romantic stares at his belle while sitting barefooted in the boughs of trees. But at least the animals are memorable - best of all is a pack of scene-stopping silverback gorillas digitally created for the movie. This Tarzan isnt quite the jungle VIP - but its got a little swing.

I thought the effects were good such as the swinging through the jungle - we had to wait a long time to hear his famous cryIt was an interesting plotline about slavery and greed and it left me wondering whether part of it was based on true events (obviously not the actual Tarzan bit)  It appeared to line itself up for another film at the end.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-legend-of-tarzan,200,thelegendoftarzan42,thelegendoftarzan,timeout
