Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) to leave no man behind. Both movies based on real events present themselves as tributes to the soldiers who fought and died in war. The sentiment expressed at the end of writer-director Randall Wallaces movie-- ""In the end we fought for each other... we didnt fight for flag and country""--is the same message delivered by Ridley Scotts film about our troops in Somalia.Hollywood has figured out a way to present war movies without seeming to rattle sabers or wave flags and at the same time appeal to our patriotic spirit. To achieve this anything overtly political is sidestepped. In ""We Were Soldiers"" the question of whether we should have been in Vietnam in the first place is never asked. Two motives seem to be at work the admirable one of paying belated testimony to the sacrifices our troops made and the calculated one of not wanting to alienate any potential ticket buyers.The other thing Wallaces movie shares with ""Black Hawk"" is its brutally graphic depiction of warfare the majority of the movie is fighting. ""We Were Soldiers"" spares few details in revealing the horrors that occurred in November 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley in the central highlands of Vietnam. (Its based on a book by Moore and journalist Joseph L. Galloway who not only covered the battle but took up arms.) This was the movie tells us the first major battle between Vietnamese and American troops. In a technical sense we were considered the victors. (Outnumbered and surrounded by North Vietnamese troops as they were its a miracle any Americans survived at all.) But theres no triumph in the movie just as there was none in the wars outcome. The enemy is not demonized. The tone is elegiac. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week ""We Were Soldiers"" is ultimately a powerful and moving experience--once it overcomes its clunky badly written and cliched first act set in Fort Benning Ga. ""Whats war Daddy?"" asks Moores little daughter just a hint of the kind of heavy-handed exposition we have to endure--along with portentous repeated references to Custers massacre at Little Big Horn nudging us in the ribs that something really bad is going to happen. Unlike the stripped-down ""Black Hawk"" which dispensed with characterizations entirely Wallaces movie wants us to get up close and personal with its young warriors so that their deaths will have maximum lump-in-the-throat impact. But when it comes to his human drama Wallace (who wrote ""Braveheart"") falls back on lazy Hollywood conventions. You can be sure that when a soldier announces that his wife back home is about to give birth hes not going to survive the next scene. Off the battlefield Wallaces dialogue can have all the spontaneity of a training manual.But when the movie gets to Vietnam and the fighting begins the movie starts to take hold. You can sense the filmmakers respect for the hard specific thrusts of warfare. The terrifying action scenes are masterfully staged conveying the close-up chaos of war without losing the larger strategic picture. And the scenes that depict the soldiers wives back in Fort Benning as they receive telegram after telegram informing them of their husbands deaths are truly wrenching. (The women with their beehive hairdos and heavy eyeliner look very 60s; the men with their anachronistic pumped-up bodies dont.)The cast is solid but its not an actors movie. Gibson dons a Southern accent and forgets about looking glamorous. Playing this craggy dedicated soldier he disappears more than usual inside his character which is not to say that you forget youre watching a movie star. Sam Elliott has a showy turn as his devoted sergeant major a soldier so gruff he gets a laugh with every hard-bitten line reading. Madeleine Stowe plays Moores devoted wife nervously watching out her window for the yellow cabs that bring those Western Union announcements. Chris Kleins newlywed soldier seems less a real person than a sop to the youth market. But if ""We Were Soldiers"" isnt all it could have been--the banal moments compromise the fierce honesty of the combat scenes--youll have to be a lot stronger than I am to resist its emotional wallop.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

As the tough and charismatic officer Mel Gibson has the closest thing to a John Wayne part that anyones played since the Duke himself rode into the sunset. The commencement of the United States direct combat role in Vietnam is painted in a mixture of brutal personal heroic tragic and at times corny and cliched terms in ""We Were Soldiers."" As the tough and charismatic officer who leads his men into the shadow of the valley of death Mel Gibson has the closest thing to a John Wayne part that anyones played since the Duke himself rode into the sunset and he plays it damn well. Due to the heartfelt sincerity with which it embraces military duty and the centrality of nation family and religion as well as its outright refusal to assume a latter-day political stance toward the fateful events of November 1965 this bloodily rendered true-life actioner will no doubt be scorned by a good portion of the intelligentsia and critical community. But it could well hit Middle Americans where they live and as a sort of ""Black Hawk Down"" with vividly rendered characters this Paramount release looks poised to score strongly with general audiences. Based on a 1992 book by the men who are played here by Gibson and Barry Pepper the commanding officer and a civilian journalist respectively pic will provoke reactions that will depend heavily upon the particular prism through which people choose to view it. Those who insist that a film about Vietnam a priori must declare its condemnation for U.S. actions will detest it; cinephiles inclined to placing it in the context of Vietnam War movies will note comparisons to if not similarities with such early cycle efforts as Waynes ludicrous ""The Green Berets"" and the outstanding little-seen ""Go Tell the Spartans"" as well as to ""Hamburger Hill"" another picture devoted to detailing a single devastating encounter; others will see it in the context of the current political climate as a coincidental but nonetheless remarkable symbol of weve-got-a-job-to-do-style patriotism. Then there are the ""Black Hawk Down"" parallels which are unavoidable Both films are extremely violent and graphic in their presentation of what modern weapons can do to human flesh both pivot on prolonged moment-by-moment presentations of tense battle predicaments in which well-armed Americans find themselves vastly outnumbered and surrounded by highly motivated enemies in hostile environments under questionable circumstances and the wrenching results of both real-life incidents had haunting political consequences albeit diametrically opposed ones The unanticipated loss of American lives in Somalia reportedly made the U.S. shy away from further such independent involvements in Third World hot spots through the 90s while the ""victory"" at Ia Drang while costly in terms of Yank casualties resulted comparatively in so many more North Vietnamese deaths that the American brass was misled into thinking that the ratios would work in their favor in the long run thus making escalation of the war effort seem eminently justified. Delineating the cost in human terms was an overriding motivation for Moore and Galloway in writing their involving tome which describes the minutia of battle with very much the same attention to detail as Mark Bowden did in his book ""Black Hawk Down."" Writer-director Randall Wallace who penned ""Braveheart"" for Gibson and whose sole previous directorial outing was the innocuous ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" has amplified this element by emphasizing the effects of the mens deaths on their loved ones back home. In these scenes the driver of a yellow taxi cab assumes the persona of the Grim Reaper as he slowly creeps through the residential streets of Fort Benning with the dreaded ""The Secretary of the Army Regrets to Inform You..."" telegrams for young wives and children. At the same time Wallace has drained some of the subtle political subtext from the book. While a professional soldier first Moore is also so steeped in military history and philosophy that he readily embraces the sorrowful absurdity of the long view along with the immediate needs of any present situation. The book is not anti-war exactly but it remains cognizant of heroism and loss in equal measure as well as of irony and a sadness that history needs constantly to repeat itself. While responsive to the themes of bravery innocence and its loss the film has an inherited second-hand feel when it comes to the profound ramifications of the actions it shows. After a useful prologue reminding of the French colonialists defeat by the Vietminh in 1954 pic jumps ahead a decade to devote its first 40 minutes to presenting a bunch of American soldiers who rep the embodiment of the Right Stuff. First and foremost is Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Gibson) a Korean War vet and Harvard grad who is preparing to lead the First Battalion of the Seventh Cavalry into Vietnam where American involvement is about to take the giant leap from ""advisory"" status to active combat. A student of war who is reading an account of Gallic misfortunes in Indochina in French Moore is acutely aware that his regiment is the same as that of the doomed General George Custer. The Army at this moment is just introducing such key guerrilla fighting equipment as the M-16 rifle and the Huey helicopter and helping Moore train the enthusiastic young men in the new type of warfare theyll be facing is a grizzled WWII vet Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott); this is one of the best screen roles this old cowboy has ever had and he makes the most of it creating rib-tickling humor out of the mans reflexive cantankerousness. Greg Kinnear turns up as Maj. Bruce Crandall the best chopper pilot in the Army while among the eager officers Moore is particularly impressed with 2nd Lt. Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) who cuts just the sort of figure any commander would want in a soldier. Unlike most modern war films this one plays up the family life of its principle figures. Moore will be leaving behind his wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe) and five young children at Fort Benning and it isnt often these days that you see an actor like Gibson get down on his knees and pray with his kids or even moreso bond with a fellow soldier in a chapel; latter in this case is Geoghegan whose wife Barbara (Keri Russell) has just had a baby girl. Attention is given to the mutually supportive relationships of the wives as well as to the societal racial divides that Moore insists will not exist under his command. In all youre made to feel that there could not be better prepared soldiers than these guys and that they could not hope to have a better leader. Suddenly they find themselves in the scrubby Central Highlands of Vietnam. So thoroughly have politics and strategic issues been stripped away that the film never discusses why the Yanks are in Nam in general or in this particular valley where they seem especially vulnerable to attack from the surrounding mountains. But since its not Moores job to question orders only to ""find the enemy and kill him"" he does the best he can and the films final 90 minutes documents the hellish three days beginning on Nov. 14 1965 that 395 Americans fought off about 2000 Peoples Army regulars in the first major firefight between opponents that would keep battling each other for a decade. Wallace presents the fighting realistically violently and relatively coherently given the chaotic circumstances; men are killed at an alarming rate choppers keep buzzing in to deliver more ammo and remove the wounded one platoon gets cut off from the main group and the Vietcong just keep on coming and coming. And while theyre not exactly given equal time nor are the North Vietnamese given short shrift; numerous scenes take place in the native armys underground h.q. to present its side of the battle and as they are in the book the communist opponent is accorded nothing but respect for being smart resilient organized well-trained and crucially more motivated. When all is said and done the clash at Ia Drang was the equivalent of the first round of a prizefight in which the adversaries test each other to see what theyre made of. (Film drops the more sobering second half of the source book devoted to a subsequent bloodbath called ""Albany."") And while the focus of the drama remains on the Americans and the skill resourcefulness and courage with which they fight against terrible odds and conditions the last word is left to the North Vietnamese commander who surveys his own dreadful losses and instantly recognizes that the tragedy of this battle is that it means the start of an ""American war"" one that will have the same inevitable conclusion but only with a much greater loss of life. Dramatically and visually pic is well made in a conventional fashion. Central California locations effectively fill in for a Southeast Asian setting thats not the usual jungle but a more sun-baked area marked by giant termite mounds and Dean Semlers lushly colored verite camerawork follows the action so intently that blood ends up on the lens more than once. Most of the action looks eye-poppingly real notably the napalm drops and their aftermaths with only a handful of digital effects added in. Gibsons performance anchors the film with commanding star power to burn. This officer truly loves his men and the credibility with which the actor is able to express Moores leadership qualities as well as his sensitive side is genuinely impressive. Aside from Elliott Klein Kinnear and Pepper as the journo who suddenly finds himself with a rifle in his hands emerge most prominently from the pack. Stowe unfortunately stands out in the wrong way among the other wives back home by looking too glamorized and movie starish.

"We Were Soldiers Vietnam before the boondoggle. Slate Sign In Sign Up We Were Soldiers Vietnam before the boondoggle. We Were Soldiers Vietnam before the boondoggle. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 1 2002 1043 AM Before the Boondoggle We Were Soldiers is a bloody harrowing look at the early days of the Vietnam War. By David Edelstein Based on an account of the United States first major battle with the Peoples Army of Vietnam in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965 the grave brutal We Were Soldiers (Paramount) is not your fathers Vietnam movie In the stature of its warriors its your grandfathers; in the visceral immediacy of its combat scenes its your sons. The action unfolds at the beginning of the conflict when the war was being fought not by boys whod come of age after the assassination of John F. Kennedy but the first baby boomers the clean-cut Eisenhower kids who never expected the sky to fall--or to go all psychedelic. (The books full title is We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young.) Its a Vietnam movie without rock n roll or drugs without nihilism with a strong military patriarch at its center. As adapted and directed by Randall Wallace (who wrote Braveheart) its square stiff and in places cheesy; its also authentically harrowing--and blood-showered blood-drowned. The films admirable father figure Harold G. Moore (played on-screen by Mel Gibson) co-wrote the 1992 book with the journalist Joseph L. Galloway who added his own first-person stories. (Galloway played in the film by Barry Pepper choppered into the battle and at its most ferocious had to wield a rifle.) Moore and Galloways agenda is straightforward akin to many recent World War II narratives to celebrate the Americans who fought and died on foreign soil. But this was Vietnam not Normandy or Omaha and so their purpose is also to exonerate. In a prologue they write Many of our countrymen came to hate the war we fought. Those who hated it the most--the professionally sensitive--were not in the end sensitive enough to differentiate between the war and the soldiers who had been ordered to fight it. They hated us as well and we went to the ground in the crossfire as we had learned in the jungles. In time our battles were forgotten our sacrifices were discounted and both our sanity and our suitability for life in polite American society were publicly questioned. Advertisement On behalf of the insensitive professionally sensitive this isnt entirely fair. Veteran Bob Kerrey for one went far in ""polite American society"" and the revelation of his alleged wartime actions demonstrates the importance of plumbing the darker side of Vietnam--not out of disrespect for brave soldiers but to understand what happens to even good men when theyre fighting for their lives in the absence of both moral authority and a coherent military strategy. Thats a different kind of memorial to the fallen--and one that might keep others from falling alongside them. But the battle in We Were Soldiers came before the great disillusionment and neither the book nor the movie has a hawkish Green-Berets-like World War II template to impose. If anything the way it lays out the bungled shortsighted U.S. entrance into Southeast Asia confirms anti-war activists most paranoid fears. Wallace begins with a mid-50s prologue in which an entire squadron of French solders is overwhelmed and massacred. (Giving the order to kill the prisoners the weary hardened Vietnamese commander adds that the more French soldiers die the fewer will come to replace them.) The Peoples Army of Vietnam are not the faceless barely glimpsed anthill denizens of Platoon and Casualties of War; inside their mountain tunnels they have their own tacticians their own frightened but determined soldiers. The audience--at least the American audience--doesnt empathize with them for a second but the images of their dead come hauntingly back when the furious battles scenes have subsided; and its the NVA commander who has the last wisest word. The foreign enemies certainly have more depth than the sluglike American ""advisers"" glimpsed sweating under ceiling fans in Saigon and wondering how long they can keep the scale of the disaster from the American public. We Were Soldiers isnt about the larger war Its true focus as in Ridley Scotts Black Hawk Down is the courage of the soldier in the field and the soldier watching his back. And Wallace is bent on monumentalizing these men giving them heroic dimension--the opposite of the Robert Altman MASH approach which set the tone for the black-comic deflation of war that persisted through the 70s and 80s. At its worst especially in the long first sequence in Fort Benning Ga. Wallaces square solemnity is laughable--a lot of indiscriminate low-angle close-ups one after another. A prayer scene with Moore and the ingenuous Chris Klein as a second lieutenant fresh from the Peace Corps is visually dead and the scenes with the soldiers wives are even worse hopelessly stiff and posed. (It doesnt help that as Moores wife Madeleine Stowe--to my taste one of the most beautiful women on earth--has gone and had her face ironed out and her lips pumped up; shes practically leaking collagen.) Wallace gets by with Moores hammy declaration that he will be ""the first to step onto the field and the last to step off"" because Gibson has real gravitas. But when he pulls that godlike low-angle stuff on Greg Kinnear--as a rough-tough-renegade chopper pilot called ""Snakeshit""--I nearly coughed out my popcorn through my nose. (Kinnear is just such a natural Frank Burns.) Advertisement When the battalion arrives in Vietnam Wallaces in-your-face approach pays off. No fancy editing no hallucinogenic light shows no sense of dissociation--just hundreds of enemy soldiers suddenly right there close enough that the cinematographer doesnt need to refocus. Saving Private Ryan raised the bar on visceral horror in combat pictures and WeWere Soldiers hurdles it. Here again is silence followed by the whine of a bullet and a Dolbyized thock as someones head or neck or chest erupts in geysers of gore--in close-up. The bombardment is so graphic and intense that it summons up your primal fight-or-flight instincts--anything more intense might kill you. The good thing about all this is that its not an ""Oh cool"" spectacle Its sickening. You cry out hide your eyes go into shock at the violation of these young mens bodies. We Were Soldiers is a fighting epic that makes fighting seem profoundly hideously unnatural. Ia Drang is in the Central Highlands way above the Mekong Delta and its jungles and tributaries where most Vietnam movies are set. Ive never been there so I have to take the filmmakers word for it that it looks like central California (where the movie was actually filmed). But apart from the strangely un-strange landscape the battle scenes feel definitive. When they begin--and almost instantly Moores battalion is on the verge of being overrun--Wallace shows how quickly the training kicks in how these boys put their bodies and brains on automatic pilot to become ""fighting machines"" (up to the point when the bullets tear through them and they are suddenly so human). And Gibson is brilliant when Moore simultaneously bellows orders fires his rifle and calculates and recalculates his and his enemys position--a combination of discipline and crazed improvisation. After their indelibly absurdist depiction in Apocalypse Now the U.S. aerial bombardments suddenly make tactical sense again They rain fire on the hundreds of NVA soldiers in the mountainside and they keep Moores men alive. The first soldier to expire in close-up says ""Im glad I could die for my country."" Thats straight from the book and its emblematic of the movies strengths and limitations. The man who allegedly said that was trying to rise above himself to conform to an ideal of heroism; and We Were Soldiers shows how those ideals held through the first horrific battle of the war. But it doesnt show us the other more frightening part of the story--what happened when those ideals didnt hold. So its not the great Vietnam movie; and Randall Wallace has maybe a tenth of Ridley Scotts talent for composition and fluid camera movement and color. But he has a moral sense so hes worth twice as much. One of his worst moves I initially thought was casting tender guileless Chris Klein as a squadron leader. Then I looked at the books photograph of the real Jack Geoghegan who has a soft young face and that same radiant gentleness. He looks like the sort of man who might have said what the character says here ""I know God has a plan for me; I just hope its to protect orphans not make any."" We Were Soldiers makes you cry for the hundreds of thousands of men and women who died so pointlessly with Geoghegan. And their orphans.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

USATODAY.com - We Were Soldiers shows us brave hearts Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/01/2002 - Updated 0450 PM ET We Were Soldiers shows us brave hearts By Mike Clark USA TODAY Paramount Pictures Mel Gibson plays Lieutenant Colonel Harold G. Moore in the true story about the battle of La Drang. The solemnly forceful We Were Soldiers might capture the publics current pulse but its strike would have been bigger if Black Hawk Down werent still playing in theaters. Everything Soldiers accomplishes with stalwart professionalism Black Hawk does better -- a comparison more justifiable than one might assume. Director Ridley Scotts instant classic plays out in Somalia and Mel Gibsons star turn takes place during the first major U.S. battle in Vietnam. But the stories parallels would be inescapable even if both large-scale productions had been released a couple of years apart. Read more below Video Check out the movies trailer We Were Soldiers (out of four) Stars Mel Gibson Madeleine Stowe Greg Kinnear Sam Elliott Keri Russell Barry Pepper Director Randall Wallace Distributor Paramount Rating R for sustained sequences of war violence and language Opens Friday nationwide Both involve an ugly combat mission for little long-term reward all within a vague political context. Indeed for a Vietnam movie made decades after the fact the film gives remarkably little political context at a time when historian Michael Beschlosss edited transcripts of Lyndon Johnsons war-tortured private White House conversations are a must-read. Based on the 1992 book We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young by Lt. Gen. Hal Moore (an admirably restrained Gibson) and reporter Joe Galloway (equally impressive Barry Pepper) Soldiers deals with a costly November 1965 mission in South Vietnams Central Highlands. Americans found themselves outmanned 5 to 1 and casualties were unexpectedly heavy. But the outcome was successful enough to influence government policy well into the next decade. This of course is all hindsight whereas the movies concerns are in 1965 Vietnam. Gibsons Moore is happily married with five kids. A student of military history he has a strong loyalty to his men. When Moore and his men end up hunkered down in and around a dry creek bed helicopters are supposed to be saving their behinds. Three days later his soldiers -- exhausted or dead -- have been forced to improvise with old-fashioned instinct. Even real-life reporter Joe Galloway has been engaged as a combatant. For a movie penned and directed by the writer of the gung-ho Braveheart (Randall Wallace) there are some surprises. Much time is devoted to the often cave-bound point of view of the enemy always shown with respect. This also is the rare combat movie that deals substantially with mourning widows on the home front including a dramatic highlight in which Madeleine Stowe (as Moores wife) and Keri Russell (a recent mother) deliver telegrams to neighbors telling them of their husbands deaths. The rap on Black Hawk Down is its so-called lack of characterization as if the fascinating logistics of the thankless mission arent enough. For those who feel that way Soldiers may be the movie of choice though it bogs down in ways its predecessor never does. Some of the early at-home material is pedestrian and performers such as Greg Kinnear (helicopter pilot) and Chris Klein (Russells lieutenant husband) have roles just large enough to point out how little they have to do. Sam Elliott however has what could be the best role of his career as a crusty sergeant major. And Gibson and Pepper click almost at once and make you understand (though this isnt one of the movies points) how their characters would be writing a book together decades later. Be forewarned that Soldiers is uncommonly but not irresponsibly graphic in its depiction of combat violence. Hollywood war movies will never be the same after the explicitness of Saving Private Ryan one of those rare movies that changes the way we perceive a screen subject. Soldiers isnt in that class but its ambitious enough -- the first film in recent memory that a major studio has chosen to release early in the year with palpable filmmaking passion and production heft.

We Were Soldiers is a Paramount ... more Photo HANDOUT They were heroes / We Were Soldiers shows the full horror of Vietnam and the full humanity of those who fought it 1 / 1 Back to Gallery WE WERE SOLDIERS Drama. Starring Mel Gibson Madeleine Stowe and Sam Elliott. Directed by Randall Wallace. (R. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""We Were Soldiers"" is one of the best war movies of the past 20 years. ""Saving Private Ryan"" may have been stronger at presenting the fierceness of combat and ""The Thin Red Line"" remains unmatched in the way it depicted the emotional and psychological experience of war. But ""We Were Soldiers"" does both those things well while pursuing a bigger picture taking in both the battlefield and the home front the experience of men on the front lines and the women who live in dread of a telegram. Most movies present soldiers as soldiers with maybe in a lull between battles some information conveyed that one guy is Italian and another is from Oklahoma. As far as most war movies are concerned soldiers could have been born yesterday and their previous lives are nothing more than interludes leading up to the one big moment. But ""We Were Soldiers"" never lets us forget these fellows have lives outside Vietnam and things theyd rather be doing. The picture may be about the nobility of sacrifice but not in a knee-jerk or deluded way. Here a sacrifice registers as a sacrifice and the audience feels the impact of each lost life. Randall Wallace who wrote ""Braveheart"" wrote and directed ""We Were Soldiers"" based on the memoir by Hal Moore the lieutenant colonel who led the American force in the 1965 battle of LZ X-Ray in Vietnam. Gibson plays Moore with touches of his usual twinkly humor but with a gravity thats new. He has the body language of someone whos fearless and knows it. Wallace chooses a smart opening a scene of French soldiers getting ambushed and slaughtered by the North Vietnamese. The memory of that gruesomeness hovers over the domestic scenes that follow as Moore and his men train at Fort Benning. ""Well be landing under fire gentlemen"" he tells them and we feel the weight having already had a taste of what theyre in for. A series of masterly sequences leads up to the mens departure. Theres a party on the base and shot from the outside it looks like any other party. But as Wallace moves his camera in we see the faces of the soldiers and their wives filled with anxiety and grief. This is followed by the scene of Gibson in bed in the middle of the night fully dressed and waiting out the moments before its time to leave. Anyone who has ever had to go on a business trip knows this feeling that in a few minutes one must leave the bed and the warm person in it to get jostled by buses and planes. Thats a viewers point of entry and from this the movie invites us to imagine how much worse this must feel. Hes going away for months maybe years. He might be saying goodbye for good. Profound moments such as these can come only when a filmmakers deep sympathy is matched by a rare artistic intelligence. Wallace films this and the surrounding scenes mainly in silence. In real life there would have been dialogue but its stronger this way. When Moore arrives at the point of departure hes joined by his lieutenants and the men stand perfectly still in a statuelike configuration. Its not realistic. Its more true than realism. Wallace puts the audience there in the middle of the night in these last seconds of calm before the commotion and the calamity. Most of ""We Were Soldiers"" involves the battle a protracted ordeal that comes in wave upon wave. One scene in which a soldier at night becomes convinced he can smell the enemy drawing near is the stuff of nightmares. At the same time the movie never loses its connection with the wives back at Fort Benning. The role of Moores wife played by Madeleine Stowe isnt big in terms of screen time but its huge in impact. Every day a cab pulls up at her door and drops off all the telegrams addressed to the wives whose husbands have been killed. Its a role that requires moments of raw emotion Stowes natural terrain as an actress. Sam Elliott is also strong as Moores right-hand man a battle-tested sergeant major but by now we expect Elliott to be tough as nails. Its Gibson who is the surprise. Anyone who has ever thought of Gibson as engaging but light needs to see him here. When he tells his men that no matter what he will be the first to step on the battlefield and the last to step off there is no doubting him. . Advisory This film contains graphic violence.

But ""We Were Soldiers"" which stars Mel Gibson has an interesting difference It takes place during the highly controversial -- and ultimately unpopular -- Vietnam conflict. This may generate mixed emotions for some. But at its most basic level this is a story about brave men -- in many cases brave boys -- and not about political issues or military hubris. The story is set in the very early days of the war before the soldiers and the country became disillusioned and cynical about our involvement in that Southeast Asian country. The film is based on the highly acclaimed book ""We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young"" by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (Ret.) and Joseph L. Galloway. Moore commanded the United States Armys First Battalion of the Seventh Calvary during the ill-fated 1965 battle at Ia (pronounced ""eye"") Drang Valley in Vietnam. Galloway was a noncombatant civilian journalist who was forced to drop his camera and pick up a rifle in order to stay alive. The ensuing battle between approximately 400 Americans and roughly 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers was one of the most savage in U.S. warfare. Ia Drang became known as a ""valley of death."" The Pentagons perception of this battle would strongly influence the United States involvement in the overall conflict that eventually cost 58000 American lives.
