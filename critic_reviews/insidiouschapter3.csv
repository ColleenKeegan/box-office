I heard him in your room while you were gone. Hes in there right now. Standing in your room.""The disembodied warning--rhythmic unassuming banal--somehow manages to instantly conjure up dread with no audiovisual effects just a kind of poetic simplicity. Unfortunately the rest of the film has no interest in the effectiveness of such subtlety.Related Story Whats in a Name? The Anonymous Horror of It Follows One way to try and avoid the curse of the un-surprising horror movie sequel is to do what Insidious Chapter 3 does introduce a new family a new setting a new spooky antagonist. But this illusion of freshness is diminished by the continuity demands of a franchise. And to that end the film tries to keep hold of only the surface aesthetics--the exaggerated surreal-looking dead people the spine-tingling score--but dispenses entirely with the genuine tension that defined its predecessors (the first film in particular). Also gone is a compelling family that earns the audiences sympathy and any semblance of cinematic creativity. The result? A lopsided shamelessly derivative effort built almost entirely on the premise that a good horror movie is all about making an audience jump.Insidious Chapter 3 is more accurately a prequel. The film begins three years before the haunting of the Lambert family of the first two films and follows high-school senior Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) who just lost her mother to breast cancer. She visits the medium Elise (Lin Shaye who starred in the first film) in hopes of being able to commune with her moms spirit. Elise kindly turns her away until an accident opens Quinn up to the attentions of a particularly angry demon terrifying her still-grieving father (Dermot Mulroney) and to a lesser extent her younger brother.Without the genuinely ominous gimmick-free spirit of the first film or the psychological terror of the second Insidious Chapter 3 gets 70 percent of its scares from Quinn sitting or lying in bed and waiting for a demon to appear in her vicinity. Time-tested cues such as an uncomfortably long silence or loud knocking tell viewers that a Big Scare Is Coming. While one of the spookiest and most memorable sequences of Insidious involved a single tracking shot that followed a young mother (Rose Byrne) through her seemingly empty house Chapter 3 mostly resorts to all the usual scare set-ups. Looking under the bed turning off the lights right after hearing a spooky sound hearing footsteps entering a dark hallway alone--its all there.Time-tested cues such as an uncomfortably long silence or loud knocking tell viewers that a Big Scare Is Coming.To its credit the film never over-strains itself to plug the gaping holes in its story which its to say its comfortable being transparently lazy. Secondary characters that seem somewhat important vanish entirely in the latter half without explanation. (If you tuned in for only the last third of the film youd understandably guess Quinn was an only child.) The halfhearted sometimes maudlin characterization of the main characters makes it difficult to care about their fates. When Quinns frazzled father snaps at her for looking like her dead mother? Its so unoriginal and unnecessarily cruel that it barely registers as authentic. Neither is the demon fleshed out literally or otherwise The most back story he gets is the hospital mask glued to his face.For all the lethargic plotting and character development there are at least a couple of really creepy moments both involving digital technology. And some of the physicality of the horror--though still characteristically low on the gore like the rest of the franchise--is delightfully outrageous even humorous. While Quinn and her father fail to hold much of the audiences attention Elise proves a better center of gravity for the film. Without giving too much away she has a few scenes of gung-ho action that would feel more silly if it werent for the rare and welcome joy of seeing a 71-year-old actress briefly become the unexpected superhero in a genre typically reserved for the young.As far as 2015 horror films go Insidious Chapter 3 is at least nowhere near as unenjoyable as the train wreck that was The Lazarus Effect (another Blumhouse Productions creation). But its also leagues away from the brilliant inventiveness of It Follows. As middling somewhat serviceable horror fare it delivers its own share of jump scares but whatever visceral effect it might have had wears off the instant the credits begin to roll.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

The title notwithstanding it takes place prior to the events of the first film showing how the ghost hunter played by Lin Shaye first encounters the goofy paranormal investigators played by Whannell and Angus Sampson. I prefer this to anything Wan has directed; unlike him Whannell is capable of more than one emotional register per scene and doesnt beat you over the head with every stylistic flourish. The quiet stretches actually serve their purpose here creating a sense of intimacy with the characters as opposed to simply marking time between the shocks. With Dermot Mulroney.

Film Details Insidious Chapter 3 RatingPG-13 GenreHorror Running Time98 min. More Info Trailer Sadly Whannell (screenwriter of Saw and both prior Insidious films) barrels through any scene that requires expository dialogue like hes a truant student racing through a test he never studied for. Insidious Chapter 3 is consequently more ambitious than either of its predecessors but just as underdone and unmemorable.None of the protagonists have strong ties to the equally forgettable ghosts that haunt them. In one scene reluctant psychic/exorcist Elise (a sadly underutilized Lin Shaye) insists that Quinn was tricked into thinking ""The Man Who Cant Breathe"" (Michael Reid MacKay) a respirator-clad ghoul is actually Lillith (Ele Keats) Quinns mother. But nothing much comes of this other than Quinn inquiring ""Mom?"" right before shes attacked by her pulmonarily challenged tormentor.

Photo Focus Features The first two Insidious films -- the tight terrifying 2010 original and its weirder though still effective 2013 sequel -- were solid examples of our eras fondness for old-school ghost and haunted-house stories. (In its own way the first Insidious was a better remake of Poltergeist than the more recent official remake.) Their focused narratives and their use of limited geography served as both a challenge and an opportunity The first film played with the claustrophobia to chilling results; while the second served as a terrific showcase for Patrick Wilson who toyed expertly with our uncertainty over his characters true nature.A The new Insidious which is a prequel to those earlier films doesnt really offer much thats new but it starts off as a reasonably reliable series of slow-burn chills. It picks up a few years before the events of the previous two movies with impressionable teenage aspiring actress Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) trying to communicate with her late mother. She approaches Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) the psychic from the first film who even though shes out of the business agrees to help the young girl. Things soon go awry due to the fact that -- as Elise tells Quinn -- ""If you call out to one of the dead all of them can hear you."" And wouldnt you know it a presence far more ill-intentioned than her dear departed ma may have caught a whiff of Quinns desperation to commune with the deceased. Soon the young girl is hearing strange noises and seeing strange movements all the while trying to convince her overworked harried single dad (Dermot Mulroney) that something not entirely normal might be going on. Elise meanwhile doesnt want to have anything to do with the situation She already knows way too much about the Further the dimension where the dead reside -- both helpful ghosts and snarling demons -- and where one sneering apparition has vowed to eventually kill her. Since the beginning the Insidious films have been a collaboration between the guys who gave us Saw -- James Wan and Leigh Whannell -- and the guy who gave us Paranormal ActivityA producer Oren Peli. The first two films were directed by Wan who has since moved on to throwing muscle cars out of cargo planes; the director this time around is his longtime collaborator and writer Whannell. While their work can vary wildly in quality all of these filmmakers have built their careers on manipulating the helplessness on which horror feeds -- helplessness on the part of both the audience and the characters. In Insidious Chapter 3 that manifests itself through a car accident that leaves Quinn immobile for much of the film her two enormous leg casts serving as a constant reminder that she cant really run away from anybody living or dead. The films most affecting quality is the atmosphere of inevitability it weaves around this girl stuck in bed Quinn is a sitting duck and the film makes sure that we know it. Whannell also makes clever use of shadowy backgrounds much as Wan did in the first Insidious -- placing figures and objects in the dark recesses of the frame that seem mundane until they suddenly arent. But as Elise comes back into the story and the film slips deeper and deeper into the Further the scares start to dissipate giving way to halfhearted bits of action clunky comedy and de rigueur world-building for the earlier (a.k.a. later) films. The dead seem a little too easily dispatched once one fights back which retroactively threatens to defuse the tension of the whole movie. (""Oh is that all they had to do?"" I found myself muttering at one point.) Theres also the small matter of Tucker (Angus Sampson) and Specs (Whannell himself) the two comic relief ghost-hunters from the earlier films who are introduced here with all sorts of knowing in-jokes that may fly over the heads of anyone who hasnt watched those films too recently. The result is a film that starts off as a solid workmanlike exercise in horror but it cant quite keep that energy through to the end. This is so often the problem with this genre -- scary setups followed by dopey resolutions -- that you sort of want to give the movie a pass. But given its distinguished forebears Insidious Chapter 3 doesnt quite live up to expectations.A Tagsmovie reviewchapter 3movies Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories What Do the Women of Cleveland Want From Melania Trump?

"Insidious Chapter 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; insidious-chapter-3 ) Insidious Chapter 3 (United States 2015) June 05 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli They say the third times the charm.  Not with the Insidious series it isnt.  Admittedly installment 3 is an improvement over 2 but it fails to reach the highs of the chilling-but-uneven original. Instead of using the stinger at the end of Chapter 2 as the jumping-off point for Chapter 3 writer/director/actor Leigh Whannell (making his directorial debut) elects to go back in time and provide this prequel/origin story. So were given the opportunity to see the events that led spiritualist Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) to join forces with Tucker (Angus Sampson) and Specs (Leigh Whannell). Im not sure anyone other than die-hard Insidious fans were awaiting that tale. Insidious Chapter 3 follows the pattern of the first film a strong beginning a solid middle act and a disappointing ending.  This time around the peaks arent as tall and the troughs are deeper. The film does a respectable job establishing characters and circumstances. The ""boo"" moments are obvious but effective nonetheless. (Thats the fun of a well-constructed ""boo"" moment - you know its coming but it still gets you.) Unfortunately the ending feels distressingly like a regurgitation of Poltergeist and involves physicality that comes perilously close to unintentional comedy.  Thats right Lin Shaye action star  (Incongruous thought that came to me while watching wouldnt it be fun to watch her team up with Bruce Campbell?) The movie stands well enough on its own that its not necessary to have seen the earlier two films. This is a Haunting 101 motion picture where the efficacy is enhanced by adding a Rear Window element to the proceedings.  That aspect isnt used as successfully as it might have been but it makes the protagonist non-ambulatory which ramps up the tension when a demon comes stalking. She cant just run away or climb out a window. Quinn (Stefanie Scott) is a bright lively high school senior whose lifes dream is to attend a prestigious acting institute after graduation. Shortly after what she believes to be a failed audition shes involved in a serious car accident that almost takes her life.  She survives but both legs are in casts. After three weeks in the hospital shes allowed to go home with her dad Sean (Dermot Mulroney). Her near-death experience however has opened her up to a supernatural world and she is being stalked by a creature of immense power and malice. When Sean realizes what Quinn is up against he calls in the cavalry first Elise then the team of Tucker and Specs.  Once they join forces they come up with an action plan that will either save Quinn or trap her forever in the shadowy realm known as ""The Further."" The demon du jour is creepy when we only catch glimpses of it although the name - ""The Man Who Cant Breathe"" - doesnt inspire fear. But as we all know the more you see a boogeyman the less scary he is. So when were exposed to more than quick strobe-like images of The Man Who Cant Breathe and learn his backstory he becomes more pathetic than terrifying. TV actress Stefanie Scott makes Quinn a likeable appealing protagonist. Thats critical; if we didnt care about the character the film would have no impact. Admittedly Scott is stuck in bed for about half the film (when she isnt in a wheelchair or being tossed around like a doll) but shes good at looking terrified. Dermot Mulroney provides Insidious Chapter 3 with its limited ""star"" power. Lin Shaye seems to be enjoying transforming a minor character from the first film into a franchise centerpiece and the duo of Angus Sampson and Leigh Whannell provide comic relief. For disposable horror Insidious Chapter 3 is adequate. If the purpose of PG-13 scariness is to get the viewer to jump a few times the movie achieves the goal. Beyond that however Whannells third installment is awash in generic ideas and familiar tropes. The movie is also very dark (visually not tonally). I understand that dim lighting can be an effective tool to enhance a certain atmosphere but the lack of adequate illumination becomes tiresome. Seemingly every scene - even when in full daylight - is suffused with gloom and I was experiencing eye strain by the end. Insidious Chapter 3 is for those desperately in need of a PG-13 horror fix. Its a better option than the recently released Poltergeist but not so much better that youd notice.

Actually its a prequel to the first ""Insidious."" I guess ""Insidious The Preface"" didnt sound that scary. Still whatever you call it ""Chapter Three"" is definitely part of the saga once again mixing a little ""The Exorcist"" with a lot of ""Poltergeist"" and then giving them some prime surreal estate to move around in. In this episode we have a brand-new family under attack and a brand-new haunted house - actually in this case an old haunted apartment. Quinns mom died recently and the girls been reaching out to her trying to contact her spirit.Not realizing of course that once you open that door almost anyone - anything - can come through. Which means a call has to go out to Elise the psychic who will end up starring in the next two - er last two - movies. And means shell eventually have to take a trip into the darkness to confront the entities that are bedeviling this poor family. The movie is the directing debut of Leigh Whannell who wrote the previous two ""Insidious"" films (as well as ""Saw"") so he knows how to deliver shocks - even if most of them are the same old ""jump scares"" of just having something suddenly appear in the frame. Boo But at least theres no found footage here. In fact some of the monsters - including a demon who looks a lot like Darth Maul and a faceless girl who seems to have stumbled in from Roger Cormans old ""The Haunted Palace"" - are refreshingly retro. Dermot Mulroney plays the typical resolute dad and Stefanie Scott is the helpless heroine who mostly gets thrown around like a wrestling dummy. As the psychic though Lin Shaye has more fun than most 71-year-old actresses are allowed going after monsters with feet fists and a straight razor. But like all of the ""Insidious"" films theres a mythology here which while meant to be complicated is just sort of confused. Demons ghosts souls entities - the story makes few distinctions and then crams them into a single place called The Further which sounds like the old Merry Pranksters bus but is apparently more like an existential bus station where the dead hang out and mope. Its full of scary stuff (and budget-obscuring dry-ice fog) but doesnt make much sense nor do its residents. Why does the chief whatever-it-is wear an oxygen mask? How did he get like this and how do you fight him? You need more than just a few images to build a real mythos. And you need more than a few sudden noises and scary shocks to make a good horror movie. But ""Insidious Chapter Three"" is at least an OK horror movie. And after the disappointments of the ""Poltergeist"" remake that will have to do for now. Ratings note The film contains gory violence and strong language. Insidious Chapter 3 (PG-13) Universal (97 min.) (PG-13) Gramercy (97 min.) Directed by Leigh Whannell. With Dermot Mulroney Stefanie Scott Lin Shaye Whannell.

Here shes a reluctant seance holder lured out of self-imposed retirement to help a single father (Dermot Mulroney) and his semi-possessed teenage daughter (Stefanie Scott). Mulroney as the frazzled dad reacts to his girls demonic situation as if she had come home with a tattoo. Taking over for James Wan behind the camera is Leigh Whannell who believes in jump scares a simple storyline and a supernatural villain who leaves stickier footprints than any Swiffer could handle. The result is a warm-hearted frightening about love and loss and yes next chapters.

"Insidious 3 holds its own with mayhem and levity - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Insidious 3 holds its own with mayhem and levity Insidious 3 Matt Kennedy / Focus Features Lin Shaye reprises her role as Elise Rainier in Focus Features movie ""Insidious Chapter 3."" Lin Shaye reprises her role as Elise Rainier in Focus Features movie ""Insidious Chapter 3."" (Matt Kennedy / Focus Features) Gary Goldstein Review Insidious Chapter 3 stands well on its own as a jumpy spookfest To enjoy ""Insidious Chapter 3"" -- and it is enjoyable -- you neednt have seen the first two films in this horror series. Although this third installment is a prequel set years before those earlier shockers which involved the haunted Lambert family (not returning here) it stands well on its own as a jumpy spookfest.The new movie establishes how Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye tops) the series pivotal psychic who was killed off in the second film began saving endangered families. To that end shes visited by Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) an earnest teen aching to make contact with her beloved late mother. But once Elise begins to ""read"" Quinn she senses trouble and warns the girl not to try to contact her mom on her own. A terrible accident follows leaving Quinn with two broken legs a forced hiatus from school and an increasingly beleaguered single dad (Dermot Mulroney). Soon though Quinn starts being harassed by a ruthless demon fighting to transport the teen to the series ghastly otherworld the Further.Things escalate and Elise is called in to help. But the clairvoyant has her own demons of the emotional kind and they will need handling as well. The characters nicely etched dimensionality adds much to the proceedings. The mayhem leads to an effectively eerie showdown between Elise and the dead to reclaim Quinns soul. Help -- and a bit of levity -- is provided by the series goofy ghost hunters Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson).

The idea was okay take the spiritual medium from the first two Insidious movies and explore her backstory. I mean shes kind of an important figure and her job isnt exactly easy what with all the restless demons out there. Why does she keep doing it? How did she get started? Maybe shes got some great tragedy in her past Yeah Oh but wait. Almost forgot we gotta have a pretty teenager at the heart of things. You know for the kids. I mean this is Insidious. Jump scares and creepy effects are what they do. Kid stuff. The result is simply awful. The jump scares are there and one or two nifty visuals but not much else. Theres certainly none of the human feeling that might have made this a compelling ghost story. And the climax stoops to action-movie hijinks that are just plain goofy given the combatants. The best you can hope for is an interesting discussion afterwards about what they could have done with the supernatural scenario they set up. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

A prequel to the original ""Chapter 3"" concerns Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) a teenager trying to connect with her dead mother. To that end she enlists the spirit wrangler Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) who aided the family in need in Chapters 1 and 2. Quinns brother suggests Spectral Sightings -- a ghost-hunting operation comprising two bickering nerds (Angus Sampson and Mr. Whannell) -- to help Elise and lo Three franchise regulars are born Needless to say evil entities crash the party. About the importance of actors Mr. Whannell wisely retains the series secret weapon Ms. Shaye a seasoned performer of range moxie and limitless charm. The third chapter finally gives her character a romantic back story and a chance to clobber a demon.

Focus FeaturesStefanie Scott left Lin Shaye and Dermot Mulroney commune with the dead in Insidious Chapter 3.(Photo Matt Kennedy Focus Features)The Insidious franchise has given horror-movie nerds a couple of haunted houses a sexy-scary ghost mom a cross-dressing serial killer and one freaky lipstick-faced demon. Yet in a genre chock-full of villains the series sets itself apart with something different a memorable heroine whos just as tough as the supernatural bad guys.Lin Shaye reprises her role as psychic Elise Rainier in Insidious Chapter 3 (  1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) a prequel story that puts the spotlight squarely on its leading lady and aims to be more heartfelt than horrifying.Elise so far has had a character arc tailor-made for fright fests She died helping save the Lambert family in 2010s original Insidious then showed up as a good-hearted specter in the spooky red-tinged afterlife known as The Further in the 2013 sequel.Shes not six feet under but in a bad place when young Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) shows up on her doorstep years before Elise meets the Lamberts. The teen tried to communicate with ""the other side"" -- specifically with her mom who died of lung cancer -- and ended up attracting a malevolent force wanting to possess her.USA TODAYLin Shayes career isnt just scary stuffBut Elise is out of the business. Shes still trying to fix her own broken spirit following her husbands death. However when the danger becomes all too real for Quinn and her dad (Dermot Mulroney) figures out that something wicked has come their way the medium comes to the rescue and meets some fellow ghostbusters (Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson) along the way.In addition to his screenwriting duties Whannell takes his first turn in the directors chair for the low-budget high-profit series. Fellow Insidious creator James Wan who also partnered with Whannell on the Saw franchise is an executive producer.While Wan created an eerier more unnerving atmosphere for the first two flicks Whannell crafts a few top-notch goosebump-induced moments of his own mainly with his chief creeper the asthmatic Man Who Cant Breathe (Michael Reid MacKay).USA TODAYSneak peek Insidious 3 brings new dreadWhat Whannell does really well is weave in past and future into the proceedings Elise has a few run-ins with the Bride in Black the veiled figure who ultimately will kill her. More importantly the debut director lets Shaye the franchises secret weapon own the movie and strut her stuff.A veteran of stage and screen for decades as a character actress Shaye shows a wide range of her talent at seance tables and going door to door in nightmarish corridors. There are the expected scream-queen scenes of course yet both Shaye and Scott -- whose characters yearn for their lost loved ones -- work well enough together to pull off a seriously powerful climax. Expect more tears than fear here.Hearts are more likely to be warmed than sent aflutter and while this is a satisfying entry into the Insidious saga those in search of major scares might need to look Further. 14 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1M8QnVK",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/06/04/insidious-chapter-3-movie-review/28468385/,200,insidiouschapter311,insidiouschapter3,usatoday

That mysterious noise? Its a sure sign something scary is going to appear -- from the opposite direction.And most crucially none of the characters can have ever watched a supernatural horror flick. They cant know the rules so they will continue to do patently stupid things like putting down the flashlight and sticking their neck through a shattered window to see if that terrifying demon is still coming after them.More Movie reviews and features""Chapter 3"" is actually a prequel to the original ""Insidious"" a breakout hit from 2010. That means fans get to see more of senior-citizen demon hunter Elise (Lin Shaye) who bought it in the first movie as well as the bromantic-comedy duo of Specs and Tucker (Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson) who run a video blog site called Spectral Sightings and arrive late in the movie in a van reminiscent of the ""Ghostbusters""-mobile.The main plot centers on Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) a doe-eyed teenager who attempts to make psychic contact with her recently deceased mother and instead draws the attentions of a demon-slash-ghost who takes the form of a decrepit old man wearing an antique respirator mask.Lin Shaye battles demons as psychic Elise Rainier in ""Insidious Chapter 3."" (Photo Gramercy Pictures)The cast of characters also includes Quinns dad (Dermot Mulroney coasting) and an old neighbor lady (Phyllis Applegate) whose senile mutterings of course turn out not to be crazy at all.To save the girl Elise must venture into the shadowy realm she calls ""the Further"" to battle Quinns demon as well as her own. There isnt much to the story really but thats OK. This is less of a movie than it is a haunted attraction filled with screak-assisted startlements and tension-building red herrings that are so predictable they require a committed audience to work at all.The film is directed by the aforementioned Whannell who has been promoted to the captains chair after writing the previous installments as well as the slasher hit ""Saw."" He paces the shocks with the precision of a much more practiced painter-by-numbers and its a good bet horror buffs will be well satisfied with the results.AZCENTRALInsidious Chapter 3 (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsAs for those who dont care for this sort of thing in the first place it is nonetheless worth their while to see one of these movies at least once in a packed theater. The fans are a hoot shrieking at the slightest provocation and chastising the characters onscreen (""Why would you do that?""). And they laugh a lot.""Insidious Chapter 3"" is almost more a spoof of a classic like ""The Exorcist"" than it is an homage. Its not scary horror its silly horror and the audience is in on the joke.Reach the reviewer at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.Insidious Chapter 3Director Leigh Whannell.Cast Stefanie Scott Dermot Mulroney Lin Shaye.Rating PG-13 for violence frightening images some language and thematic elements. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1M8NdBw More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

Chapter 3 is still involving review Insidious Chapter 3 may seem more inevitable than interesting yet with Leigh Whannell at the helm and Lin Shaye busting ghosts it manages to avoid the Curse of the Triple Cash Grab.Lin Shaye reprises her role of Elise Rainie in Insidious Chapter 3. Will there be a chapter 4?By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 4 2015Insidious Chapter 3Starring Lin Shaye Stefanie Scott Dermot Mulroney Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson. Written and directed by Leigh Whannell. At GTA theatres. 97 minutes. 14AInsidious Chapter 3 may seem more inevitable than interesting being yet another craven bid by a horror franchise to wring every last dollar and shudder out of its audience.Yet this prequel to the shriek hell directed and scripted by series writer/actor Leigh Whannell manages to avoid the Curse of the Triple Cash Grab. Article Continued BelowIt does so by going deeper into ""The Further"" with Lin Shayes ghostbusting Elise Rainier who is a character far more compelling (not to mention durable) than the spooked Lambert family of the previous two chapters.Demon zone The Further doesnt even yet have a name when the picture opens a few years prior to the Lambert hauntings.Innocent du jour Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) journeys to the dusty abode of Elise a renowned but reclusive psychic seeking help in contacting the girls dearly departed mom. Elise dearly wants out of the Ouija board biz but she hears out the girls tale of nightly knock-knocks that could be maternal -- or diabolical. ""If you call out to one of the dead all of them can hear you"" she warns.No one in a horror film ever follows advice at least not at the start. And Insidious 3 comes with the expected jump scares and impediments to good sense a clueless dad (Dermot Mulroney) an annoying younger brother (Tate Berney) and this series version of comic relief nerdy paranormal investigators Specs (Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson).Before you can scream hellzapoppin Quinn and her clan are in the midst of a full-on possession quest by relentless demons led by an entity called The Man Who Cant Breathe who looks like the decrepit older brother of Dennis Hoppers Frank Booth from Blue Velvet.The random and relentless nature of these attacks gives Insidious both its name and essential creepiness with the mind curdling at the thought that the evil undead attack the living as much for sport as for a desire to consume human life force.These Insidious freaks are also insanely messy leaving sticky black footprints everywhere they go.All the more reason to celebrate Shayes plucky Elise. Not afraid of ghosts or other ghoulies shes ready and willing to mop the floor with these spectral invaders no matter what dimension theyre in or how deep into the flames she must travel. When the Zombie Apocalypse comes as it must shes the one youre gonna want on your front porch shotgun at the ready.You just know Elise will be back at it again sooner rather than later in a movie that has a ""4"" cleverly worked into the title.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Lin Shaye reprises her role of Elise Rainier in ""Insidious Chapter 3."" (Matt Kennedy/Focus Features) By Michael OSullivan June 4 2015 The horror prequel ""Insidious Chapter 3"" is a simple origin story laying out in somewhat ho-hum fashion the details of how everyones second-favorite ghostbusters -- steely spiritual medium Elise Rainier and her clownish sidekicks known as Specs and Tucker -- got together. Does anyone really care? Leigh Whannell apparently thinks so. The writer of all three ""Insidious"" films -- who also plays Specs -- takes over the directors chair from horror maestro James Wan (""The Conjuring"") moving Elise (Lin Shaye) and company a little bit more front and center. Thats fine by me. Along with Shayes supernatural exterminator the characters of Specs and Tucker (Angus Sampson) were the best things about chapters 1 and 2 proving popular enough to spawn their own series of tie-in webisodes. But the two characters whose role as providers of comic relief is reminiscent of ""The X-Files "" Lone Gunmen are also somewhat polarizing. As Whannell explained to the fan site Dread Central in 2012 ""There was this hatred that spewed out from fans saying I hated those guys They sucked They ruined the [first] movie "" For the record Specs and Tucker are not what ruined the first -- or for that matter the second -- movie. That was both filmss over-the-top depiction of a fog-shrouded underworld populated by soul-sucking zombies and ruled by a Mephistophelian demon made up like Darth Maul. But as much as I and some others like them they are not enough to save ""Chapter 3"" from the same things that sunk the first two films. Set a few years prior to the haunting depicted in the original film the third installment centers around a teenage girl (Stefanie Scott) who has been targeted by a new stalker from the afterlife a realm known in all three movies as ""The Further."" This restless etheric entity -- referred to in rather clinical fashion as The Man Who Cant Breathe -- is just what he sounds like an old dude in a hospital gown with an oxygen mask. I guess to Whannell and his under-40 cohort there is nothing scarier than the geriatric wing of a hospital. Anyway TMWCB haunts the apartment building where Quinn (Scott) lives with her widowed father (Dermot Mulroney) and little brother (Tate Berney) feeding off Quinns soul which he appears to nosh on in nibbles the way an old man might take a week to finish a snack-size bag of chips. His half-finished meal is rendered in one of the films stupidest -- and most literal-minded -- visual effects as Quinns body without a face and with a couple of extremities missing. For no apparent reason TMWCB also leaves oily footprints which are there one minute and gone the next whenever Whannell needs something to jolt the audience awake. Thats unfortunately often in this film which is more silly and soporific than scary. Im glad to see Shaye back after her character was killed off in ""Chapter 2."" At 71 shes still got what it takes to tangle with a poltergeist. And Specs and Tucker provide welcome fizz to the all-too-leaden proceedings. Even the reappearance of the ghostly ""Bride in Black"" -- the supernatural villain from the first two films -- is a good thing. Its just that the ""Insidious"" franchise after three attempts to exorcise its real demons still cant seem to shake what really haunts it the ghost of B-movies past. PG-13. At area theaters.

Thats not good. By Michael Ordona Updated 1023 am Thursday June 4 2015 The best advice to those who choose to spend 97 minutes of their lives on ""Insidious Chapter 3"" Bring earplugs. And maybe make better choices. The ""Insidious"" franchise was already on fumes with ""Chapter 2"" and this prequel has nothing left but backfires to try to jolt viewers. Very very loud backfires. Its a physically painful experience waiting for the sound mixers next assault. You know its coming but its still a ball-peen hammer to the ears every time. The first ""Insidious"" introducing us to a haunted family and psychic Elise and her ghostbuster friends generated some mild creepiness before blowing it all in a third act that tried to explain everything. The second entry nose-dived into rehash. Why did they make a third? The second ones reported budget was 5 million; it grossed about 162 million. Credit where credit is due the mysteriously well-reviewed ""Insidious"" and its first sequel play as an intended pair -- ""Chapter 2"" sort-of cleverly triggers traps laid in the original. But the prequel (written and directed by series co-creator and co-star Leigh Whannell best known for his similar position in the ""Saw"" franchise) is such a shameless rolling of rubes desperate for a scare the filmmakers dont bother coming up with anything new. The gag is thus Teen and aspiring actress Quinn (Stefanie Scott) has been trying to contact her dead mother. As ""Insidious"" watchers know thats a no-no and sure enough something that is not Mom has gotten wind of her. Next up the requisite long sequence of Dad (Dermot Mulroney) not believing her while Elise (Lin Shaye) decides to help. ""Chapter 3"" is supposed to go further into ""The Further"" where mean ghosts await suckers with Ouija boards but its deepest penetration is into touchy-feely land. In ""Chapter 3"" love is the answer. And darn it belief in yourself. With precious little story to tell or scares to perpetrate the film actually grabs for heartwarming in the end with sausage-like fingers. If that sounds ludicrous its a major step up from Whannells ""Saw"" movies. ""Insidious Chapter 3"" is simply not scary. Not a bit not a whit. Except that the audience will be terrified of the next stabbing of their eardrums at generally predictable intervals. The most frightening thing about the third chapter is that it might be profitable enough to make a fourth. Michael Ordona is a Los Angeles freelance writer.

The sequel was a classic case of diminishing returns as it eschewed the moodiness of the original in favor of lame soundtrack crashes. The third entry in the series finds original creator James Wan (he was busy instructing Dwayne Johnson on the art of flexing his way out of an arm cast in Furious 7) passing the writing and directing reins on to Saw writer Leigh Whannel whos making his directorial debut. Though Chapter 2 ended on a cliffhanger Insidiots--thats what were calling the hardcore fans of this franchise--will have to wait to find out how that all ends as Chapter 3 rewinds to a few years before the first movie primarily to tell the story of how psychic Elise Rainier (the resilient Lin Shaye) got into the dimension-jumping demon hunting business in the first place. Shes contacted by young Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) who just lost her mother to cancer and would like the opportunity to say goodbye. But in reaching beyond the grave she unwittingly unearths a malevolent spirit who wants to eat her soul. At first Quinns father Sean (Dermot Mulroney) thinks shes just being difficult but when the beastie starts leaving behind goopy footsteps and cracks in the ceiling he calls on wannabe ghostbusters Tucker (Angus Sampson) and Specs (director Whannel). When they fail its up to Elise to keep a creepy dude in a breathing mask from pulling Quinn all the way into the dark side of the afterlife. The third act which finds Shaye finding her inner badass in the spirit world has a nice pace to it but it takes half a lifetime to get there. Part of the sluggishness of Chapter 3 comes from the fact that it chooses to turn its protagonist into an invalid pretty early on (and does so in accidentally hilarious fashion) leaving Quinn in a pair of leg casts that prevent her from running away from evil. But it also drags because weve seen all the moves before making just about every jump--most of which are the equivalent of leaping from behind a doorway and banging some pots really loud--feel pretty perfunctory. And despite being a prequel Insidious Chapter 3 doesnt even really do any fan service The initial meeting between Elise Tucker and Specs unfolds in deeply uninteresting fashion and Elise calling the oft-visited death plane ""The Further"" is a completely random afterthought. Insidious Chapter 3 ends on something of a cliffhanger that theoretically puts Elise in mortal danger but considering we know she makes it to the first movie unscathed theres not a whole lot to worry about. In fact its more fun to imagine the next five minutes of that characters life after the credits roll than it is to power through yet another underwhelming series of exhausted horror movie tropes. Insidious Chapter 3 is the worst kind of sequel Not terrible but also cartoonishly unnecessary.

Or in the case of this largely fright-free horror flick attracting the attention of a faceless demon that feeds on the life force of women. Directed with not much flair by Leigh Whannell (who wrote the previous two installments) Insidious Chapter 3 is being billed as a prequel. The franchises stars - Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson - have bailed replaced by Dermot Mulroney as widower Sean Brenner and Stefanie Scott as his 17-year-old daughter Quinn who live together in a spooky apartment block. Clanking pipes replace creaking doors as the first sign that something sinister is afoot and when Quinn is involved in a car crash that puts her in a wheelchair both legs in plaster the evil spirits come out to play. What Insidious Chapter 3 has in common with the two earlier films is The Further a netherworld of lost souls and a place into which humans illogically can wander willy-nilly. Lin Shaye returns as Elise Rainier a psychic with the manner of an Avon lady bumblingly assisted by ghostbusting sidekick nerds Tucker (Angus Sampson) and Specs (played by director Whannell). With just a handful of jumps and one fingernails-on-a-blackboard scene in which a possessed Quinn walks on broken legs dont expect any spills or chills from this third outing. It is silly rather than scary more insipid than insidious.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Before the Insidious franchise Lin Shaye was best known for playing bit parts in Farrelly brothers comedies. (Remember the lascivious landlady from Kingpin? Yep thats her.) And horror a genre that likes its actresses either young virginal and resourceful or young promiscuous and dead might seem an unlikely place for a seventysomething to shine. But thats what Shaye does in Insidious Chapter 3 a prequel that completes the arc of her character reluctant psychic Elise Rainier from a supporting player to the emotional core of the series. Unfortunately Insidious Chapter 3 tends to hit its emotional beats just a little too hard--Shayes big Ripley moment where she challenges a demon with a defiant ""Cmon bitch"" comes off more goofy than empowered and the films sentimental resolution borders on treacly. But as a wise compassionate fearless motherly protector Shaye is awesome. The self-assured older woman is contrasted with Stefanie Scott as Quinn Brenner a high school student who is rendered literally helpless for most of the movie with two broken legs and a neck brace. That makes her easy prey for demons which begin to insinuate themselves into Quinns life after she attempts to contact her recently deceased mother. Frightened and confused Quinn reaches out to Elise who is mourning a loved one of her own and initially refuses to get involved. But as the attacks against the physically and emotionally vulnerable Quinn escalate Elise begins having visions of the imperiled young woman and eventually comes to her rescue. (Its reminiscent of the relationship between Danny Torrance and Dick Hallorann in The Shining a comparison that bears itself out in the orange and brown patterned carpet in the hallway of Quinns apartment building.) The motif of grief runs throughout Insidious Chapter 3 which is surprisingly thematically rich for the third installment of a horror franchise. This emotional undercurrent informs the fright scenes which otherwise lean rather heavily on jump scares. But some of those grabby bits are admittedly effective and director Leigh Whannell enhances them with grotesque character designs and well-executed sound always an asset in a horror movie. Production designer Jennifer Spence who also worked on The Lords Of Salem and the Paranormal Activity movies deserves recognition for her work as well which stands out when it needs to and recedes into the background when it doesnt.Whannell a longtime collaborator of Insidious and Insidious Chapter 2 director James Wan wrote or co-wrote all three films in the series which explains his obvious affinity for the returning characters. (He also plays one of those characters nerdy ghost hunter Specs who--along with his crony Tucker played by Angus Sampson--provides comic relief.) Where Whannell stumbles is in the necessary grunt work of setting up those familiar faces which really only come into play in the second half of the film. Early expository scenes feel lackluster and the Brenner family is about as thinly drawn as Whannell could get away with. Theres really not much to say about Dermot Mulroney whose sole character traits as Quinns dad are that hes frazzled and kind of clueless and even less to say about her little brother played by Tate Berney. So if Whannell and company want to make an Insidious Chapter 4 which the last five minutes of the movie make it obvious that they do fine. But next time dont devote half the film to some generic family that is only going to appear in one installment anyway. Just make it the Lin Shaye show--it appears to be what Whannell wants to do and its what this reviewer wants to watch.

The gooey demon will make you jump at least once. Director Leigh Whannell (137). PG-13 violence frightening images language thematic elements. IF I found a trail of slimy black footprints in my apartment Id turn around and run away faster than you can say cheesy horror flick. But then tweenyboppers wouldnt have anything to watch this weekend. ""Chapter 3"" the third installment in the ""Insidious"" franchise is actually a prequel. Thats good because then theres no backstory to catch up on. Fans will recognize from previous films some key players Lin Shaye as medium Elise Rainier and Angus Sampson and Leigh Whannell as ghost-busting sidekicks. But the rest of us arent exactly in the dark thinking of them as simply a heroine psychic and comic relief respectively. There is a plot here involving a dead mother a dead husband and things that go bump in the night. The gist of things is that pretty high-schooler Quinn (Stefanie Scott) is being slowly possessed by a demon living in the vents of her building. Widowed father Sean (Dermot Mulroney) enlists Elise and the goofball ghost-hunters. There are lots of creepy apparitions suddenly shrieking violins and dont forget those footprints. Characters open doors they shouldnt and inadvisedly turn to take a look. Its like the fun-house ride at the amusement park. You jump out of your skin the first few times the skeleton pops out at you. By the end of the ride youve gotten a good look and its not so much scary as hokey. Still there are worse things than hokey. Scott is pretty and innocent and its nice to see Mulroney play for laughs. Whannell wrote the first two movies as well as this one and now acquits himself as a director. ""I was scared at least 10 times"" I heard someone say upon leaving the theater. Not bad.

Until now the Insidious franchise has dealt with the haunting of two generations of the Lambert family and its attempts to exorcise a demonic legacy. Co-starring Patrick Wilson Rose Byrne and Lin Shaye the two previous films generated some genuine dread as well as significant box office in 2011 and 2013. Clearly the least menacing of the trilogy Insidious Chapter 3 offers a relatable young protagonist and several key supporting players from the prior films in a nimble setup to the series. While the film introduces some creepy new characters the decision to move away from the original movies often complex mythology boosts the capacity of the new installment (from Focus Features Gramercy Pictures) to stand on its own. The result may be a broader audience to build on an already substantial fan base. Instead of revisiting the Lamberts fraught history Chapter 3 relies for continuity on the supporting character of Elise Rainier (Shaye) the psychic who aided them in the first two films. When shes first introduced -- ""a few years before the Lambert hauntings"" as a title card reveals -- Elise is far from the determined demon-hunter she later becomes; shes living as a virtual recluse after the death of her beloved husband when teenaged Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) comes knocking at her Hollywood Hills door. Still distraught over the death of her mother Lily a year earlier Quinn is seeking help contacting her in the afterlife. Elise reluctantly agrees to assist but then quickly reverses course when her attempt to reach out to Lily reveals a far more sinister entity shadowing Quinn. Read more Box Office Preview Melissa McCarthys Spy Aims to Spook Insidious 3 Entourage Elise sends the girl home after warning her not to attempt connecting with her mother again but its already too late to shield her from catastrophe. Quinn begins noticing a shadowy figure that seems to be following her drawing her into danger when shes hit by a car and ends up in the hospital with two broken legs. Confined to her bedroom in the apartment she shares with her father Sean (Dermot Mulroney) and younger brother Alex (Tate Berney) while she recuperates Quinn experiences increasingly frightening phenomena which she desperately reports to her disbelieving dad. But a terrifying disgusting figure continues reappearing in her room as she cowers helplessly in bed unable to flee. As dreadful events continue recurring in his home soon even Sean cant deny that something mysterious and deadly is trying to harm his daughter. When he seeks out Elise shes too afraid to help convinced that the demonic realm that she refers to as ""the Further"" will overwhelm her if she does. Sean is therefore left on his own to confront the demon intent on pursuing Quinn. Insidious co-creator Leigh Whannells economical script vividly reimagines Elises motivations for using her ""gift"" to aid the demon-afflicted while providing a clearer plotline that avoids many of the convoluted indulgences of the first and second episodes. The seemingly obligatory references to horror classics remain although The Exorcist replaces The Shining as the films preferred template. Read more Star Wars The Force Awakens Named Fandangos Most Anticipated Movie of 2015 As a first-time director Whannell skillfully navigates the films sometimes complex mix of practical and visual effects together with cinematographer Brian Pearson only gradually revealing the extent of the threat that Quinn faces before shifting into full-on terror mode. Whannell also returns to provide comic relief along with Angus Sampson comprising the high-tech ghost-hunting team that Elise recruits as her assistants in the other films. Shaye reprises a substantially expanded role as Elise the only genuine clairvoyant in the film. With a performance that shifts from stiff and introspective to fearlessly compassionate she remains the series satisfyingly unwavering moral compass. Mulroneys part registers as rather underwritten as he plays the doting dad inspired to become his daughters defender but finally is forced to leave the heroics to Elise. In her first horror film Scott effectively charts the transformation of Quinns initial girlish enthusiasm into increasing dread and eventual rage as she succumbs to demonic possession. Production designer Jennifer Spence and composer Joseph Bishara assiduously attend to the critical visual and musical details of this well-polished feature contributing to the impression that the Insidious franchise may continue to benefit by branching out from its original premise rather than recycling or returning to it.

Chief among things that go bump in the night in ""Insidious Chapter 3"" is the movie itself -- a thuddingly dull prequel to James Wans very enjoyable (and highly profitable) demonic-possession horror franchise. Like last years subpar ""The Conjuring"" spinoff ""Annabelle"" this direly routine ghost story marks a huge comedown in production values and performance quality from the series previous entries (which earned a combined 258 million worldwide) despite the presence of longtime Wan collaborator Leigh Whannell behind the camera and always game-faced elder scream queen Lin Shaye in front of it. But the movies cardinal sin is that its a stifling bore -- a ""chapter"" even devotees may deem less than essential summer reading. After devoting two films to the bedevilment of the Lambert family -- specifically a spooky old hag that had attached itself to patriarch Josh (Patrick Wilson) from childhood -- the ""Insidious"" series seemed poised to continue on as a series of ""Ghostbusters""-style adventures involving the paranormal investigators Specs (Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) and their mentor Elise (Shaye) who returned to the series in spectral form after dying (at Joshs hands) in the first film. But curiously Whannell (who scripted both prior ""Insidious"" films as well as the Wan-directed ""Saw"" and ""Dead Silence"") sidelines those amiable folks for much of ""Chapter 3"" which takes place ""a few years"" before the events of the earlier films. Were introduced to yet another family who have unwittingly let a soul-sucking entity into their lives widower Sean Brenner (Dermot Mulroney) his teenage daughter Quinn (Stefanie Scott) and bratty preteen son Alex (Tate Berney). Quinn especially is still coming to terms with the death of her cancer-stricken mom whom she has been trying to contact vis the spirit world. But as one knowledgeable party advises early on here ""If you call out to one of the dead all of them can hear you"" -- which in Quinns case means the presence shes begun to feel watching over her is anything but motherly by nature. Where one of the strengths of Wans ""Insidious"" movies was their plausible family dynamics (including Barbara Hersheys wonderfully meddlesome grandmother) ""Chapter 3"" so often feels like a second-tier 1980s sitcom that you spend a good deal of the film wondering if Whannell was aiming for parody (like last years viral short ""Too Many Cooks""). Mulroney does his best (but still not very convincing) Tony Danza as the frazzled single dad who doesnt know how to pronounce ""quinoa"" forgets that his daughter is a vegetarian and is forever screaming at his son to get ready for school (this characters sole defining trait). We also get a lovestruck boy next door (Ashton Moio) who makes goo-goo eyes with Quinn (and gets dagger glances back from Dad) and standing in for the wacky upstairs neighbor an ectoplasmic emphysema patient (Michael Reid MacKay) whose restless spirit failed to vacate the premises along with his body. Soon strange voices are wafting through the ventilation shaft next to Quinns bed large cracks appearing in the ceiling and tar-like footprints streaking across the floor. Is this a job for an exorcist or merely Mr. Clean? Splitting the difference the Brenners seek out Elise first seen here as a widow whos turned her back on the spirit world after venturing there in search of her late husband and bringing back some unwanted ghostly baggage on the return (a revelation that directly ties the new film to its predecessors). Elise has arguably been the breakout (human) character of the ""Insidious"" films and Shaye gives her the kind of elder-statesman glow that Donald Pleasance brought to the ""Halloween"" series. The younger sister of New Line Cinema founder Bob Shaye was a frequent featured player in that studios movies (including the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"") before becoming a member of the Farrelly brothers stock company but Elise is the plum role of her long career and she plays it with the joy (even when shes being scared stiff) of an old working pro whos been waiting for her moment in the spotlight. Its all the more puzzling then that ""Insidious Chapter 3"" keeps Shaye in the shadows for so much of its running time and keeps Specs and Tucker (introduced as bumbling practitioners of a YouTube ghostbusting channel) on ice for even longer. During most of that time Whannell tries his hand at the kind of atmospheric slow-burn scares that made Wans films textbook examples of what Roger Ebert termed ""bruised forearm movies"" (so named the intensity with which they cause your date to squeeze your antebrachium). But whereas Wan (who retains a producer credit here and makes a cameo appearance) is the sort of director who can effortlessly turn a billowing curtain or creaking floorboard into an unbearable portent of dread Whannell rarely makes the neck hairs quiver let alone stand at attention. The only risk of arm injury here comes from the frequent checking of ones watch. Around the one-hour mark once Whannell finally has the whole ghost-hunting band back together again ""Insidious Chapter 3"" gives off a few fleeting sparks of pleasure and conjures up a couple of memorably creepy images (including that of a half-formed woman with no face hands or feet). But what finally can one say about a movie in which the family being haunted seems more embalmed than the ghosts doing the haunting? While none of the ""Insidious"" films have cost very much this is the first one that can be said to look cheap with the flatly lit washed-out digital cinematography of Brian Pearson a poor substitute for the silky elegance John R. Leonetti brought to the previous films in the series. A distribution note ""Chapter 3"" marks the first film to go out under Universal/Focus revived Gramercy Pictures brand intended to become the studios new genre-film label.

Demontriell says January 10 2016 at 604 pm I saw this recently and completely disagree. This was better than the second and pretty close to the first. This reviewer seems obsessed with the older characters to give this one a chance. Also the lighting this movie is well done. I prefer this version of ""the further"" to Wans version. I think it needs to be noted that this is many levels above where youd expect a 3rd installment of a franchise. Reply releasernews says August 18 2015 at 753 pm Reblogged this on releasernews.

Aquaman Starring Jason Momoa Why Entourage May Find Itself Outside the Velvet Rope at Box Office Spy SXSW Review Melissa McCarthy Saves the World in a Bawdy Bloody Espionage Comedy Scream Queens to Premiere at San Diego Comic Con 2015 The scares are OK in this third movie but the veteran character actress makes the most of a meaty role and lots of screen time If writer-director-costar Leigh Whannell crafted this third entry in the ""Insidious"" series as a valentine to actress Lin Shaye then its a box of chocolates for the audience as well. As a horror movie -- specifically a Blumhouse horror movie -- ""Insidious Chapter 3"" delivers pretty much what youd expect from the shrieking musical riff under the main titles onward. But as a vehicle for Shaye a veteran character actress getting the most screen time shes ever been given its a blast to watch her anchor this atmospheric look at the personal costs and triumphs of devoting your life to duking it out with nasty presences from the other side. Prince may have asserted in ""Purple Rain"" that ""in this life things are much harder than in the afterworld"" but the ""Insidious"" movies would beg to differ presenting us with a realm that Shayes character Elise calls ""The Further"" where the restless souls of the dead keep trying to muck about with those of us still on the physical plane. See Video Insidious 3 Trailer Teases Origins of Blumhouse Horror Franchise (Video) The better-than-expected ""Insidious Chapter 2"" ended by setting up a sequel -- without Elise -- so thankfully Whannell (who has written all three and is now taking the directorial reins from James Wan) went the prequel route showing us what got Elise back into the ghost-busting biz and how she teamed up with sidekicks Specs (Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson). This movies victim is Quinn (Stefanie Scott) a high school senior who feels the constant presence of her recently deceased mother. Unable to reach out to her on her own Quinn turns to Elise for help in communicating with the dead woman. As it happens Elise is in a bathrobe-clad funk of her own; her beloved husband killed himself a year ago and in trying to find him in The Further she attracted the attention of a ghastly spirit who scared her out of using her gifts to speak with the departed. Elise advises Quinn not to muck about with such spiritual matters on her own but you know teenagers; of course it doesnt help that Quinn and her father Sean (Dermot Mulroney) happen to be living under one of the most haunted apartments since Sigourney Weavers penthouse in ""Ghostbusters."" Soon Quinn is seeing a mysterious presence and finds herself trapped between life and death with only a reluctant medium and two nerdy paranormal-chasing Internet geeks coming to her rescue. I wrote ""Disney Channel"" in my notes soon after Scott appeared on screen and as it turns out she spent three years starring on ""A.N.T. Farm."" Shes got some cable-cuteness unlearning to do but shes certainly capable as the victimized Quinn bolstered by Mulroney whos taking everything seriously enough to make us buy into the otherworldly goings-on. (Sean also has a son -- Alex played by Tate Berney -- who phases in and out of the story so unpredictably that you almost expect a third-act twist wherein hes dead too.) Also Read Abbie Cornish Dermot Mulroney to Star in Psychological Thriller Lavender Ultimately this is Shayes show all the way in a role that allows her to play a full array of tones funny to vulnerable despondent to determined. Awards-giving bodies dont tend to take performances in genre films all that seriously but her work here represents a triumph for a movie veteran of 40 years -- she made her screen debut in Joan Micklin Silvers ""Hester Street"" (1975) -- whose most-remembered film role pre-""Insidious"" was as the horrifyingly over-tanned landlady in ""Theres Something About Mary."" As a director Whannell doesnt have the facility for cheeseball PG-13 jump scares that Wan brought to the prior two films (to say nothing of ""The Conjuring"") but he scores a few memorable ones even when characters are literally sticking their necks somewhere they absolutely shouldnt. Also Read Eli Roths Cannibal Movie The Green Inferno Lands Distribution From Blumhouse Label Whether Whannell wants to keep the ""Insidious"" train rolling or if hed rather stop after three I have no strong feelings either way. If he wants to keep giving Lin Shaye roles this meaty however Im definitely on board.
