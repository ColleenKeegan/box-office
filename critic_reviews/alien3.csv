This third entry has only one creature but unfortunately its just as gormless. When Ripley (Weaver) crash-lands on a prison planet full of hard-nut slap-heads they havent seen a woman in years. Discovering that theres an alien loose Ripley asks the warden to break out the guns and cant believe it when she is told there arent any. Nor can we. Good acting has salvaged many a poor script in the past but not here. Dance is slaughtered in the first act as is the regulation bastard warden (Glover) leaving only Sigourney impressive as ever and a motley cast of extras. Though wasteful of the expensive sets Finchers tight close-ups do add to the sense of claustrophobic panic.

Those of us born before 1975 cant possibly comprehend all of the introductory information that goes clicking across the on-screen television monitor spelling out time place and imminent crises with the relentlessness of a speed-reading exam. The information is also so understated that only someone who speaks computer language realizes that life as we know it is about to crash. Yet again. What the computer generation knows and the rest of us dont is that this information isnt really necessary or especially relevant. Logic is out. Visceral sensation is the point. Unlike ""Alien"" (1979) and ""Aliens"" (1986) the new film directed by David Fincher puts no great emphasis on futuristic technology. ""Alien 3"" belongs to that branch of fantasy comics best exemplified by the ""Road Warrior"" movies in which the iron and space ages meet for dizzy results. As ""Alien 3"" begins a spaceship headed back to Earth suffers unidentified flight difficulties. ""Stasis interrupted"" is the way the television monitor announces it. Aboard the ship snugly unconscious in their sleep pods are Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and the other survivors of the dreadful battle that ended the 1986 movie. By the time the opening credits have finished the spaceship has crashed on Fiorina 161 and Ripley wiser and heaven knows how much older is the only person left alive. Fiorina 161 is a planet but we never see much of it. Clearly though it is a place where the sun doesnt shine. The outside temperature hovers in the neighborhood of 40 degrees below zero. Formerly a maximum-security prison Fiorina 161 has been decommissioned and is now home to 25 of societys worst rejects former prisoners who have elected to remain on the planet to live lives of edgy atonement. They are members of what is called ""an apocalyptic millennarian fundamentalist Christian sect."" Whatever they are they obey their own commandments. Theyre a rude obscene and dirty lot. The place is so infested with lice that the first thing demanded of Ripley is that she shave her head. The men dont take kindly to the arrival of a beautiful if exhausted young woman. Inevitably there is an attempted gang rape from which Ripley is saved by Dillon (Charles S. Dutton) the planets unofficial chaplain. Its not one of the prisoners who initiates the films only successful sexual encounter. It is Ripley. Straightforward liberated woman that she is she propositions and is accepted by Clemens (Charles Dance) the planet doctor and a man with a past. As Ripley gets to know the guys and awaits a rescue ship she slowly becomes aware that just possibly one of the aliens she fought earlier has somehow arrived on Fiorina 161 with her. A pet dog is murdered in a ghastly way. ""What sort of animal would do this to a dog?"" someone asks. Then prisoners start disappearing. Pretty soon its all-out mobilization on planet Fiorina 161 which seems to be about the size of a suburban high-school gymnasium with a catacomb-like basement. Ripley and her new comrades are at a disadvantage. There are no weapons on Fiorina 161 not even flashlights. All they have is fire and their wits. Matters arent helped when poor Ripley learns that she is carrying a little alien inside her and no ordinary alien but a queen capable of producing thousands of eggs. How the little stranger got there remains a mystery though Ripley thinks it must have happened while she was in her sleep pod. Shes an intergalactic Marquise dO. ""Alien 3"" is more entertaining than this synopsis makes it sound. The script is sometimes intentionally funny. Ms. Weaver has a brisk no-nonsense approach to the material. She never betrays it but she also never suggests that the movie is anything more than a haunted-house movie for the space age. She has a way of spreading her intelligence around upgrading everything in her vicinity. The production is dourly handsome with great chunky dimly lighted sets that suggest dungeons out of the Middle Ages. They are actually so dark that sometimes its not easy to know who is doing what to whom. Blood looks black which may not be all bad. The alien is seen in glimpses but its seen often enough so that it seems to be nothing worse than a large dark sticky lobster claw with a terrible disposition. In addition to Ms. Weavers Ripley only two characters are defined to any extent Mr. Dances doctor and Mr. Duttons unofficial chaplain. Lance Henriksen who played Ripleys faithful android in ""Aliens"" appears again briefly mostly in separate pieces. Mr. Fincher who has directed music videos for Madonna Billy Idol and others doesnt waste time trying to make things plausible. His direction of ""Alien 3"" suggests that he grew up reading instructions on how to program VCRs. He knows that most explanations like directions are incomprehensible and thus irrelevant. ""Alien 3"" which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) includes vulgar language mock violence and sexual situations.

"Alien 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; alien-3 ) Alien 3 (United States 1992) A movie review by James Berardinelli First there was the creepy horror of Ridley Scotts atmospheric Alien. Then some six years later James Cameron took elements from the first and crafted one of the best science fiction/action films of all time Aliens. After two such superior efforts anticipation was high for the third (and final?) installment of the trilogy especially after early promotional campaigns offered the slogan ""On Earth everybody can hear you scream."" Alas Alien 3 is not the movie fans were hoping for. Sigourney Weaver is back as Ellen Ripley but its the writing and direction (by music video master David Fincher) more than the acting that lets us down. Plot inconsistencies abound and by killing off Ripleys surrogate daughter Newt before the movie even begins much of the emotional underpinning of the previous film has been rendered moot. A character with that much importance in determining the heroines motivation deserves something more noteworthy than an off-screen murder. (Hicks is dead too but he was more disposable). Alien 3 is simply put a mess. The writers have no idea how to tell a coherent entertaining story. With the exception of a surprise or two there isnt much worthwhile here. The storyline frequently doesnt make sense with actions occuring for which no explanation is given. Direction editing and camerawork combine with the disjointed script to disorient and confuse the viewer. Given Finchers background it shouldnt come as any surprise that the movie looks like a music video. Another lackluster aspect of Alien 3 is its feeble score while pales in comparison to James Horners rousing work for Aliens. The characters are paper-thin in large part because there are too many of them. Had individuals been better-developed their uniform unlikability might have been interesting but as it is this trait is off-putting. The few denizens of Alien 3s prison planet given any personality are treated badly by the script. There are a number of action scenes but because of certain plot contrivances and an inability to feel for the characters theres little excitement or suspense. At least the atmosphere is suitably dark and dreary. As for that tag line about screaming on Earth -- our homeworld is nowhere to be found. The film takes place on a weaponless prison planet where Ripley has crash-landed conveniently bringing an alien with her (it impregnated Newt during transit). Now its a struggle to kill the creature before it wipes out the criminal population. In many ways this is just a higher-tech rehash of the first film. As a science fiction or horror film Alien 3 is barely passable but compared to its two predecessors its a sorry end to the trilogy. I enjoyed the first two films but in their wake found this one barely watchable and not especially enjoyable.

Dutton; Charles Dance; Paul McGann; Brian Glover Under 17 restricted Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa ""In space"" said the ad for ""Alien"" in 1979 ""no one can hear you scream."" In ""Alien "" you dont have to bother about space. The third teaming of Sigourney Weaver and Ms. Slime is nothing to scream about. If theres suspense in the movie its in wondering why the title is a cubed sign rather than ""3"" or ""III"" or just ""Even More Aliens.""Never answered.In terms of summer-movie oomph somethings missing. Perhaps the alien has become too familiar to us. ""Youve been in my life so long"" Weaver tells her mucous opponent ""I cant remember anything else."" Maybe its the obvious lack of high-tech spaceware or just the sense of sequel weariness. You know youre watching a rehash when the credits say ""based on characters created by Dan OBannon and Ronald Shusett.""Once again Weaver is shocked to discover the alien loose -- this time in a desolate prison colony. Youd think shed get over those surprises by now. Once again she has to rally a group of macho men (rapists and murderers) to take on the beast; and once again it doesnt take a college degree to guess wholl be left facing whom.As Warrant Officer Ripley she has been hypersleeping her way through space again in that funny human pod box. Shes also been dreaming about -- you guessed it. Her spaceship crash-lands on Fiorina 161 a barren planet used for a maximum-security correctional facility. For reasons that remain obscure the prisoners have found a certain quasi-fundamentalist Christian faith as bullied into them by jailbird mentor Charles S. (""Roc"") Dutton.Weaver suspects the indestructible alien may have been on board her ship. A burn mark here an eviscerated dog there you pick up on these things. When it becomes clear the creature is at large (after all this is called ""Alien "") Weaver assesses the available weaponry. On this colony where supply ships are few and far between there isnt much. She shaves her head (to get rid of the lice) and gets to work.Ironically ""Alien "" is not a bad movie. In fact -- heres the rub -- its too interesting to make an exciting summer flick. At the core is a promising tale written by Australian filmmaker Vincent Ward who made ""The Navigator An Odyssey Across Time"" an often brilliant time-hopping saga about medieval men journeying into the 20th century.His ""Alien "" is woven out of the same classic sci-fi yarn. The prison is a Middle Ages-type institution with gaunt-faced monastic characters in robes walking through dark twisting corridors bearing candles.There are other small delights more likely to have come from credited scriptwriters David Giler Walter Hill and Larry Ferguson. Weaver strikes up a quickie affection with prison doctor Charles Dance -- an odd but appealing space-age wham-bam-thank-you-sir. Theres a dramatically revealing conversation between Weaver and her half-destroyed robotic ""droid"" who recalls what happened on her ill-fated spaceship.But most everything else feels like an excuse not to have more exciting (read expensive) things happen. This movie -- peopled with English performers including Brian Glover Ralph Brown Paul McGann and Danny Webb -- seems more like a ""Star Trek"" episode than an ""Alien"" picture. Its also hard to get a handle on how big or small the alien is the usual sign of low-budget horror filmmaking. Sometimes it seems small as a child; other times it looms eight feet high. You begin to wonder if this is the real alien or just a stunt Muppet.

"Alien 3 Related Item Go to Video Finder Alien 3 By Hal Hinson Washington Post Staff Writer May 22 1992 Director David Fincher Cast Sigourney Weaver; Charles S. Dutton; Charles Dance; Paul McGann; Brian Glover Under 17 restricted Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa In space the first ""Alien"" film told us no one can hear you scream. That was 12 years and two films ago and unless the laws of physics have changed the statement still holds true. So scream all you like. Scream your head off. ""Please Not again Uncle Ive had enough Stop it stop it Please stop it"" Its no use. No one will hear you.If the first two ""Alien"" films didnt satisfy your appetite for the prolonged duel to the death between warrant officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her irrepressible foe ""Alien "" the third and most oppressive most redundant movie in the series will probably do the trick. This time out the action is set on Fiorina 161 a maximum security penal planet reserved exclusively for the dregs of the known universe. (Didnt there used to be a cereal with the same name?) The inhabitants of this dank medieval-looking burg all have an extra Y chromosome in common which if Ive got my genetics straight means that you do not work well with others.Most of these Double-Y boys are either murderers or rapists or murderers and rapists. A troop of Boy Scouts theyre not even if they have found solace from their desperate circumstances in an apocalyptic form of Christianity. One things for sure though They dont like girls. So when Ripleys emergency evacuation capsule accidentally lands in their laps theyre not at all pleased to see her. And if theyre unhappy with the mere presence of a woman waitll they get a load of her luggage.After 12 years youd think that Ripley might catch a break. But no way. Shes like one of those women on the afternoon soaps who are always getting kidnapped or stuffed in the trunk of somebodys car; if it werent for bad luck shed have no luck at all. After Ripley is given the skinhead look to prevent an infestation of lice she spends the first section of the film wondering if her old nemesis has tagged along. Unfortunately theres very little suspense in this because if he didnt well there wouldnt be much of a movie.As gruesomely unabsorbing as this early segment is its still the most interesting part of the film primarily because once the creature makes its entrance the movie simply becomes a grisly game of monster tag. In ""Aliens"" James Cameron who also directed ""The Abyss"" and the ""Terminator"" films followed Ridley Scotts original by digging into the maternal subtext of Ripleys character; by turning the movie into a mythic cat-fight between warring moms he supplied a raison detre for the sequel.In ""Alien "" director David Fincher whos best known as a music video Wunderkind and screenwriters David Giler Walter Hill and Larry Ferguson fail to come up with a comparable wrinkle. As a result theres nothing new to discover in either Ripley or her dilemma. Basically shes dinner; if she doesnt get it its going to get her.The films only original ingredient is its dark disease-infested atmosphere; it looks as if it were shot in the Paris sewers. And the color-bled textures do cast a gloomy spell. But if youve seen Vincent Wards ""The Navigator"" these details wont come as much of a revelation either. (Ward whos credited with supplying the story was listed early on as the pictures director.)There are a few narrative twists but not enough new ideas to keep us guessing. In the end were stuck running through air shafts and corridors again. Given this context Weavers shorn head could almost pass for a plot development which is more than you can say for her brief and entirely pointless liaison with the prisons medical officer (Charles Dance). The Marine recruit buzz cut does emphasize the drama of Weavers underbite -- which is slyly mirrored by the savage angle of the creatures own jawline -- but though from moment to moment she is entirely credible in her emotions her performance holds no further surprises for us. Also the butch glam queen she inaugurated in ""Alien"" has by now become a familiar type; like the Great Mother Alien in the second film she has spawned a whole generation of Terminator dames.But in ""Alien "" the character seems rather old hat and instead of staking her definitive claim on the archetype the actress joins the ranks of her imitators. These days shes just another girl with a gun.

Dutton Sigourney Weaver; Director David Fincher; Author David Giler; Runtime (in minutes) 114; MPAA Rating R; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted May 29 1992 -- 1200 AM EDT By now there must be an entire generation that thinks ""horror movies"" are those interchangeable gorefests that line the back shelves of video stores. Theres more to it than that though. A true horror film doesnt just indulge our taste for gross-out shocks; it offers a kind of cleansing awe and dread. Its this quality honed to video-age precision that gave the original Alien its squeamish power. With its twitchy monster fetus and oozing organic spaceship its Orwellian-nightmare imagery of decay and engulfment the movie ripped directly into your subconscious -- it was the futuristic horrorshow as bad acid trip. Aliens James Camerons rousing paramilitary sequel certainly didnt lack for thrills but it played down the first films atmosphere of psychosexual terror. Now that unsettling mood is back only in a muted almost elegant way. Alien3 is a grimly seductive end-of-the-world thriller with pop-tragic overtones that build in resonance as the movie goes on. Directed by David Fincher a 28-year-old graduate of rock videos the movie resurrects both the fear-sick mood and squishy-obsidian look -- water dripping down dank walls mysterious dark coils illuminated by shafts of light -- that made Alien such a sci-fi mindbender. Alien3 though is quieter more languid. This time Lieutenant Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash-lands on Fiorina 161 a planet inhabited by a crew of brutal criminals who have been sentenced to slave labor at a mineral-ore refinery. For Ripley this is truly hells last circle The pollution flies by in ungainly black chunks shes surrounded by rapists and killers (to channel their libidos the prisoners have turned themselves into a millennialist religious cult) and because of a lice problem everyone must shave their heads. The effect of Weavers shorn locks is eerily sensual; it forces us to feast on the beauty of her bone structure. The Joan of Arc do is the taking-off point for Weavers supple and anguished performance easily the most ambitious she has given in this series. In Alien3 Ripley is a battle-scarred warrior-survivor whos been fighting these tentacled machine-jawed beasties for so long that theyve become in effect her other half her cross to bear. Now the horror arrives from within As a single alien stalks the prisoners another one still unborn is growing -- inside Ripley. Its a terrifically queasy conceit evoking our darkest fears of disease and unwanted pregancy and lending the films second half a tensile purity. For once an MTV veteran knows what hes doing with actors. Fincher gets thoughtful performances from Charles Dance as a fallen physician who cleaves all too briefly to Ripley and from Charles S. Dutton as a horn-rimmed rapist who is humanized by his eloquent pragmatism. The scenes with the other prisoners have a bombed-out comic nihilism reminiscent of the Mad Max pictures. As for the alien itself it is seen mostly in feral glimpses (sometimes you wish the shots were held longer) and it has been subtly reimagined as a skittery helmeted spider sucking the life out of its victims. And what of the brave exhausted Ripley? For much of the movie she appears doomed yet the visionary climax -- a true knockout -- proves that neither she nor the junk-pile world shes inhabited are utterly beyond salvation. I wouldnt call Alien3 a better film than either of its predecessors but its one of the rare sequels that truly measures up. It brings this series to a fitting shiver.
