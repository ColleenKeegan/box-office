Illegal Mexican immigrant Carlos (Demian Bichir) toils away each day tending the gardens of wealthy Angelenos and although his lack of legitimate ID makes him circumspect the opportunity to buy his retiring bosss pick-up truck and take over the business himself is not one to miss. It means borrowing money but promises a better future for his US-born-and-raised adolescent son Luis (Jose Julian). However actually getting behind the wheel of the truck is only the start of his problems...Pitched as an educational journey for white-bread America the film oozes sympathy and thrums with indignation as it lays out poor Carloss limited options for the pursuit of happiness. Although theres more mainstream gloss here than youd find in the usual grainy handheld indie pic Weitz holds back on button-pushing special pleading helped by Bichirs persuasive everyman and Julians credibly sullen teen. Its in trying to deliver a story that is both social-consciousness raiser and saga of father-son cross-generational transcultural understanding that the effort begins to tell. The didacticism takes the shine off Weitzs accomplishment even if the film builds up enough empathy to generate slow-burning emotional impact. Well-meaning and genuine its just a bit too medicinal for its own good.

Add to ... JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 15 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jul. 14 2011 616PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The wheel as we know cannot be reinvented. But a 1948 Italian neorealist classic about two wheels can be reimagined for the contemporary big screen - and without feeling like a mere retread. The shape of Chris Weitzs richly detailed beautifully scripted A Better Life set mostly in east Los Angeles traces that of Vittorio De Sicas influential Bicycle Thieves (which for Toronto cinephiles screens in glorious black and white July 28 at the TIFF Bell Lightbox). Through a family sacrifice a struggling father gets money to buy a vehicle a means to more stable employment. But during his first day on the job his wheels are stolen. Believing he can find the thief the father accompanied by his only son embarks on a determined yet increasingly dangerous search. In A Better Life the vehicle is a fully loaded landscaping truck. Carlos (revered Mexican thespian Demian Bichir) has been living for years in L.A. as an undocumented garden worker raising his son alone. Now 15 (older than De Sicas son character) Luis (Jose Julian) is skipping school and mingling with neighbourhood gangs - although for now at least the main attraction is the lively family dynamic. Their communication problems are not just about the generation gap. Luis knows little about his cultural background. He doesnt want to talk about his mother who abandoned the family. Realizing his son is slipping away Carlos borrows money from his sister and buys the truck and client list from his boss. He can barely contain his excitement; Luis can barely contain his embarrassment. But deeper feelings surface a little later when the film hits its main track a story about a father and son emotionally connecting as men for the first time. After picking up Santiago an older worker and arriving at a hillside estate Carlos scales a tall palm tree and pauses to survey the spectacular view. Echoing the crucial turning-point scene in De Sicas film Carlos cant scramble down in time as Santiago drives off. The search is a journey of cultural discovery for Luis. The trail leads to an apartment crowded with illegal immigrants a Mexican rodeo then a confrontation with Santiago at his restaurant job during which Carlos is shocked by his sons behaviour. The search goes on but the road ahead darkens. De Sica shot Bicycle Thieves on location in post-Second World War Rome and used non-actors an approach employed by many filmmakers considered part of the Italian neorealism movement. A Better Life also hits the streets and casts many non-actors in small parts. But neorealism is an inspiration not the style. Bichir delivers a powerful nuanced performance as a stoic but complex character who treats everyone - even those who have wronged him - with a dignity he rarely receives. Veteran Spanish cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe shows us rarely glimpsed corners of L.A. with a vibrancy felt through colour and dramatic framing as opposed to fast moves. Speaking of moves A Better Life is an interesting one for Weitz who produced American Pie and directed The Golden Compass and ahem The Twilight Saga New Moon. Whatever the reason (his grandmother was a Mexican movie actress) this film feels more personal that just a gig. A Better Life opens in Toronto at the Cumberland on Friday; other Canadian cities to be scheduled.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 125577698 Lead actor gives A Better Life its emotional power The story of an illegal alien in Los Angeles is heartbreaking thanks largely to Mexican actor Demian Bichir.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune July 14 2011 -- 354pm Merrick Morton Summit Films Jose Julian and Demian Bichir in ""A Better Life."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In ""A Better Life"" Demian Bichir delivers an inspired performance that lifts a banal drama to the next level. The Mexican actor brings a lived-in sadness to his role as Carlos an illegal alien gardener for homeowners in Los Angeles. Climbing to perilous heights to trim his customers palm trees he can look across the citys flatland expanse and see his own rundown neighborhood. The play of emotions in his eyes as he observes that chasm -- the expression of a man who has borne a lifetime of hard labor and bad breaks without flinching -- burns its way into the memory. For Chris Weitz the director of films as diverse as ""About a Boy"" ""The Golden Compass"" and the Twilight saga entry ""New Moon"" this project is clearly one from the heart. Weitz whose grandmother was a Mexican film starlet invests his hero with nobility of a nearly theological order. If Carlos were any more virtuous he could walk right across the tops of his clients swimming pools. The bad guys be they gang-bangers or rent-a-cops invariably have smirks that could curdle milk. Too many of the cast members seem hokey and out of synch with the authentic-feeling barrio locales. The script recycles impeccable if unacknowledged source material lifted wholesale from Vittorio De Sicas timeless ""Bicycle Thieves."" Single father Carlos buys a pickup to carry his tools so that he can start his own lawn business and afford to send his U.S.-born teenage son Luis to a better school. The truck is stolen but reporting the loss to the police would risk deportation. Father and son search for the truck opening up rusty channels of communication along the way and the sometimes ungrateful boy begins to see his dad in full for the first time. The writing of these heart-to-hearts gets awfully sticky (Luis ""Why did you have me?"" Carlos ""For a reason to live""). The story breaks some new ground in a third act that takes a legal-procedural look at the workings of immigration enforcement a sequence that feels like it was grafted on from a different movie. Bichir redeems the secondhand plot and on-the-nose dialogue. He steals scenes by walking around and looking very real as though a normal human being had somehow sneaked into a gaggle of performers. The right actor can supply a role with power and emotion beyond a writers grasp and Bichir is just about perfect. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Starring Demian Bichir Jose Julian Director Chris Weitz Running time 127 Release Opened Jul 15 2011  Editorial Review Chasing the American dreamBy Ann HornadayFriday July 15 2011Early Oscar list-makers please write down this name Demian Bichir.Bichir a movie star in Mexico whose most familiar role to date was as Fidel Castro in Steven Soderberghs ""Che"" delivers one of the most powerful performances of the year in ""A Better Life"" Chris Weitzs engrossing unassuming drama about an undocumented Mexican worker in contemporary Los Angeles. With such classics as ""El Norte"" and more recently ""Sin Nombre"" and ""Under the Same Moon"" having addressed the subject matter already and so well viewers might be forgiven for asking just how many immigration movies we need. As ""A Better Life"" proves as many as there are stories to tell.In this case the story concerns Carlos Galindo (Bichir) who does lawn-care work while taking care of his 14-year-old son Luis (Jose Julian) an angry spoiled kid who surrounded by ""Hollywood Cribs"" on TV and gangs on the street is on the verge of succumbing to the lures of thug life. When Carlos takes an opportunity to buy his bosss truck hes finally in a position to create a business for himself. While hes atop a swaying palm tree one day that dream comes crashing down turning the movie into a 21st-century American version of the wrenching Italian neorealist drama ""Bicycle Thieves.""Weitz whose resume includes the dizzyingly diverse slate of ""American Pie"" ""About a Boy"" and a ""Twilight"" movie hews to a disarmingly simple storytelling style in ""A Better Life"" which chronicles Carlos and Luiss journey through the most elite and impoverished precincts of L.A. as they embark on a classic cinematic quest. But what Weitz and screenwriter Eric Eason capture so vividly is the sense of simultaneous dislocation and complete integration experienced by young people of foreign descent who have grown up drenched in American culture. With his hip-hop Spanglish cadences Luis embodies the contradictions of that generation with poignant pointed subtlety whether with the withering contempt he gives his working-class dad in a posh nightclub or quizzically listening to the announcer whose Spanish he cant understand at a local Fiesta del Charro.If ""A Better Life"" falls into too-pat schematic order at times its emotional pull is undeniable thanks in large part to Bichirs quietly potent performance of a good man whos incapable of doing the wrong thing until he does. Without a scintilla of showboating or begging for the audiences sympathy Bichir never allows Carlos to be a victim instead giving him the dignity of his choices good and bad smart and dumb legal and illegal.""A Better Life"" might not change any minds about immigration policy but it illuminates the conversation with context compassion and understanding. And by the time Carlos utters the films heart-stopper of a final line audiences may feel ambivalent about where hes going but theyll have a newly awakened sense of where hes coming from.Contains some violence profanity and brief drug use.

Summit Entertainment Demian Bichir in ""A Better Life"" (Summit Entertainment) Fewer and fewer filmgoers relate to the great melodramas of Italian neo-realism so maybe now its safe for a Hollywood hitmaker like Chris Weitz to adapt one of its milestone movies to the Mexican-American experience.Weitz has indulged in fantasy films (""The Golden Compass"") and has profiled privileged whiners on both sides of the Atlantic (""American Pie"" ""About a Boy""). But here he turns his attention to his own backyard. Literally.This is a sentimentalized story about the ghostly gardeners (and dishwashers and dressmakers) who keep Californias wealthy whites in the dark about economic inequities. Landscaper Carlos (Demian Bichir) lives in a one-bedroom hovel in east Los Angeles far from the towering palm trees and green lawns he trims in the coastal suburbs. Carlos a widower hitches a ride with an enterprising friend and saves his money to make a better life for his son Luis (Jose Julian). Luis is the kind of Latino teen who doesnt speak Spanish and admires the local gangbangers more than he does his dad.When Carlos borrows heavily to buy a truck he thinks it will win his sons respect. Instead the illegal immigrants dream spins out of control and he enlists the embarrassed boy to help him pick up the pieces.With its clockwork series of unfortunate events this movie loosely influenced by Vittorio De Sicas ""Bicycle Thieves"" unfolds like a fable instead of a believable slice of life. Mexican TV and film star Bichir gives a poignant performance but hes distinctly more European than the cholos and Chicano laborers on the sketchy edges of the heros plight. And while its understandable that Weitz doesnt have an instinctive feel for the immigrant underclass its puzzling that he doesnt give us a glimpse of the ""better life"" to which Carlos aspires the one that Weitz himself inhabits.Yet notwithstanding its modest scope ""A Better Life"" richly documents the life of an invisible man.

Carlos is loving with the seedlings he transfers to his clients yards. He is loving with his teenage son Luis (Jose Julian) who waves him off with attitude. More about A Better Life >> Personally and professionally Carlos is about getting transplants to root in new soil. He is a day laborer an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. He toils long hours. To Luis Carlos is a little man with little dreams and less cash unlike the gangbangers with big dreams and bigger bankrolls who want to recruit the high-schooler. On its surface Chris Weitzs movie is the odyssey of an undocumented workers search for his stolen landscaping truck a tale not unlike Vittorio de Sicas The Bicycle Thief in which father and son form a closer bond. Its deceptive simplicity makes A Better Life so emotionally profound. This film based on a story by Roger L. Simon is a compassionate character study of a man modeling the values of heart hard work self-respect and self-reliance to his spawn. The film rests on the slight shoulders of Bichir an exceptional actor whose way of holding back his emotions draws the audience to him. Because his Carlos has such bedrock decency there is no self-pity in his weathered face. There is worry perhaps but also alegria joy in the company of Luis. Alegria in the tending to gardens of fabulously wealthy employers to whom he is mostly invisible and who are blind to his art. Look as Carlos embraces a palm tree like a dance partner shimmying up to prune away its dead fronds. Bichirs face contains multitudes. Weitzs observant and sympathetic film notes but does not make political capital of the irony that though Carlos is in America illegally he is a model citizen unlike the native-born gangbangers. Except for one line of dialogue about the American dream (delivered by the amigo who wants to sell his truck to Carlos) there is not a false note in the fine screenplay by Eric Eason or in the deeply felt performances. After Bichir Gabriel Chavarria should be singled out for his nuanced turn as a coworker who tests both Carlos patience and his principle. In its low-key portrait of illegal immigrants and its trust in the audience to draw its own conclusions A Better Life recalls The Visitor. Like that film Weitzs movie is equal parts heartache and hope a privileged glimpse inside the lives of the new generation of American dreamers.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + A movie called ""A Better Life could almost only be about immigrants. Its generic and small but manages to reel you in and surprise you with its grimness. To get there a few too many coincidences provoke too much unearned emotion (whence so many tears?). But as movies go about East Los Angelenos stealing back their stuff this one is sincere.Carlos (Demian Bichir) shares a one-bed apartment with his teenage son Luis (Jose Julian). Its fair to think this movie was originally written for two women since Luis treats his dad the way teenage girls treat their mothers. The difference here is that Luis is yea-close to the tractor beam of gang life and theres not much that Carlos seems capable of doing to reroute him. The boy doesnt quite respect his father whos an illegal Mexican day laborer who has a great rusty mustache and drives without a license. But his fortunes change after he buys into a landscaping business that fills them both with hope for the titular upgrade.At some point Carlos hikes up one of the palm trees whose fronds he cuts back and in the smogless Los Angeles vista he glows momentarily at the prospect of even a hint of prosperity. Its fleeting. In that very same scene Carlos stops daydreaming in time to look down and see the bad news that he spends the rest of the movie trying to correct. The situation does bring him closer to Luis. They hit the streets together looking for answers and the director Chris Weitz who also made ""About a Boy and the second ""Twilight movie allows the relationship between Carlos and Luis to simmer during their mini odyssey. Luis wants to jack up everyone whos crossed his father. Carlos wants to use the experience to teach Luis that not all problems deserve a Crips solution.Eric Easons script is storybook simple even after the legal complications. But how does one ignore the sadness in Bichirs smoky good looks? Hes not the most expressive actor - he was Mary Louise Parkers drug kingpin baby daddy on ""Weeds - but what he lacks in range he makes up for here in concentrated decency. This isnt a case of a liberal-minded movie inflicting goodness upon a character but a man radiating goodness because well he is good.Which I suppose is essential in a movie whose point seems to be As bad as things are they could always be worse. Its true. Carlos could be the unemployed father in Vittorio De Sicas ""Bicycle Thieves a tragedy that ""A Better Life evokes and whose panoramic cruelness has lost none of its power to shock after 71 years. This new movie goes out of its way to be punitive in ways that came naturally in De Sicas film. Weitzs movie isnt daring enough to grind a life down the way De Sicas did. Weitz and Eason strain for politics which with them while considerably less powerful is effective in its way. Its not people who are inherently flawed the movie argues. Its this countrys immigration system. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

A Better Life Good Director Chris Weitz. Cast Demian Bichir Jose Julian Eddie ""Piolin"" Sotelo. Rating PG-13 for violence language and drug use. New movie releases this week Showtimes Interview Demian Bichir It can as ""A Better Life"" shows. Chris Weitz whose credits include ""About a Boy"" ""American Pie"" and ""The Twilight Saga New Moon"" may seem an unlikely candidate to direct a story about a man in this country illegally for years while trying to make a living and carve out a future for his teenage son. But for most of the film Weitz riding a fantastic performance by Demian Bichir as the landscaper in question succeeds in showing the day-to-day struggles that exist beneath the political rhetoric and upper-case headlines. If we can see how things will play out long before the characters do its still powerful and one gets the feeling valuable - not just as a document of the immigration struggle but as a film. Carlos (Bichir) has labored for years doing yard work to support himself and his son Luis (Jose Julian). Like most teenagers Luis is rebelling trying to form an identity of his own. But his case is more complex. Luis knows that his father loves him but hes also embarrassed by him - the illegal who mows other peoples yards for a living while Luis is trying to be as American as possible. Its heartbreaking to see his discontent when we see how much Carlos cares about his son how much he wants to create a better life for him. For Luis its trickier still. Hes increasingly intrigued by the gangbanger lifestyle that surrounds him in East LA on the streets and in school. The appeal of that lifestyle is evident; its as far from Luis father as he can get. Yet he also knows the dangers of that life - he sees them every day. Carlos meanwhile is offered an opportunity His boss wants to get out of the landscaping business and move back to Mexico and he wants Carlos to buy him out. The offer includes the truck they ride in to jobs every day as well as their tools. Its not as if Carlos has the money for such a purchase. Nor does he have the necessary documents including a drivers license. But he manages to scrape together the cash and takes the risk. What happens next is cruel and perhaps predictable. But it brings father and son closer than they have been before a shared purpose that culminates in a late afternoon spent waiting at a rodeo with Carlos reminded by a song of the promise he had for their lives when Luis was young. (The song he hears was Luis favorite as a child though the son no longer remembers it.) There is no easy road for Carlos or for Luis but Carlos does what he can to make Luis journey easier. It wont be without sacrifice. Weitz doesnt indulge in political grandstanding here. Instead he lays out what is a remarkably straightforward depiction of the life of those trying to find a way trying to better themselves and their families. Bichir is tremendous as a man who simply gets up every day and does what he must to make that happen knowing that even then it may not be enough. ""A Better Life"" wont solve any immigration problems; its not trying to. But thanks in large part to Bichir it offers a look at the kind of life we too often see as caricature as political fodder for one side or another. His performance elevates the film above that and its a refreshing if ultimately sad depiction. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Comments click to enlarge A Better Life Recommended Rated PG-13  98 minutes  2011 In this soulful drama an illegal immigrant from Mexico (Demian Bichir) borrows 12000 to buy a used truck so he can start his own upscale gardening business in LA and after the vehicle is stolen he and his resentful son (Jose Julian) search for it across the citys Latino neighborhoods. Screenwriter Eric Eason blatantly recycles the premise of Vittorio De Sicas The Bicycle Thief (1947) but mostly avoids the other movies sociopolitical element to focus instead on his flawed protagonist. A major star in Mexico Bichir is quietly affecting as the father a humble striver who faces loss at every turn. Chris Weitz (The Twilight Saga New Moon) directed. In English and subtitled Spanish.

Carlos (Demian Bichir) and his son Luis (Jose Julian) have a problematic relationship. Photo Merrick Morton Summit Entertainment A Better Life 1 / 1 Back to Gallery As an undocumented Mexican immigrant struggling to do right by his teenage son Demian Bichir is a portrait of humility and fear. His manner is soft-spoken. His face is lined with sadness and cracked by a pair of quizzically mismatched eyebrows. His every move is cautious the deliberate behavior of a man who aims only to ""stay quiet ... and try to stay invisible."" If Bichir were known only for unassuming types his turn as a humble gardener in Chris Weitzs A Better Life would still draw lavish praise Its straight true and heartbreaking a masterstroke of raw emotional minimalism. But the fact that Bichir is at this point best known to American audiences for playing Fidel Castro (in Che) and a suavely menacing drug lord (on Showtimes Weeds) makes his transformation into the sad-sack Carlos nothing short of jaw-dropping. The film itself is a simply affecting look at a man beset with problems not the least of which is his immigration status. Yet this isnt some polemic. Its not pushing any specific immigration reform or political viewpoint. Its only pushing Carlos his humanity his desperate scramble to support himself and his son Luis (a natural persuasive Jose Julian) with a pickup filled with gardening tools. Purchased with a 12000 loan from his sister (Dolores Heredia) the banged-up truck gives him new hope for a better life in Los Angeles. This is needless to say only the beginning. Admirers of Italian neorealist cinema will spot the obvious parallels with Vittorio De Sicas Bicycle Thieves from the father-son bond at the core of the story to the ache that it leaves when its over. The vehicle of redemption might have four wheels instead of two but the crushing urban poverty and the desperate search for work are unmistakable. A Better Life isnt an instant classic but it tells its story with a simplicity and compassion that other urban dramas would be wise to emulate. Weitz taking a break from the genre frippery of New Moon and The Golden Compass may seem an odd match for a bare-bones Hispanic tale set in East L.A. But he isnt really Apart from his own Latino roots (his grandmother starred in the first Mexican talkie) he also has a relaxed way with scene pacing and a faith in human nature that brushes close to sentimentality but never touches it. Even with gang elements circling like sharks -- Luis is unaffiliated but curious - the film maintains its distance from maudlin and lazy stereotyping. For this Weitz shares the credit with Eric Eason who wrote the clear-eyed screenplay from a story by Roger L. Simon and Javier Aguirresarobe whose cinematography captures the grit and gleam of Los Angeles. We see the city as Carlos sees it filled with longing from his roost atop a palm tree and we watch it shift from gangland poverty to high-end estates on the ride to work. The landscape always changing is one of two important transformations that mark A Better Life.

By JOY TIPPING jtippingdallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 30 June 2011 0509 PM Updated 30 June 2011 0509 PM Related Showtimes for A Better Life Its a tricky thing to cinematically take on a hot-topic issue without being all maudlin and preachy. With A Better Life director Chris Weitz (About a Boy; Twilight New Moon) neatly avoids sanctimony by centering the engrossing story on a father-son relationship letting the audience make up its own mind about the overarching matter of illegal immigration.That said anyone who feels strongly about immigration from any viewpoint really needs to see this film. Eric Easons script superbly nonjudgmentally tallies the human toll taken on those seeking that ""better life"" and trust me youll see immigrant gardeners cooks and baby sitters in a whole new light.The story centers on Carlos Galindo (Demian Bichir) a gardener living in East Los Angeles and his teenage son Luis (Jose Julian). Luis mom we learn ran off years ago. In their tiny house Carlos sleeps on the couch so his son can have the sole bedroom.The father rises at dawn pulls on his work boots slogs through a 12- or 14-hour day in the broiling LA sun comes home collapses onto the couch sleeps a few hours and does it all over again. The son attends a broken-down high school where the temptations of gang life seethe all around him. It doesnt help that his girlfriend is part of a sprawling crime-centered family that takes Luis in like a lost cub.When Carlos boss (owner of the truck tools and gardening contracts) decides to retire Carlos with the help of his sister scrapes together the money to buy the business. Too soon though a day worker -- someone Carlos had befriended and trusted -- steals the truck and Carlos and Luis bond while trying to get it back.The two get a lead on where the thief works at night but have to wait for the restaurant to open. Carlos takes the rare chance to introduce his son to some Mexican culture by taking him to a nearby rodeo in a gorgeous scene that evokes the sense of familia that Carlos has left behind. Once they discover the trucks whereabouts the story briefly turns into an excellent 15-minute suspense-thriller but that fraught adventure leads to Carlos arrest by immigration officials leaving Luis in the care of his aunt.Carlos talks while incarcerated with a sympathetic but overworked lawyer give some eye-opening insight into the machinations that probably occur on a daily basis in detention centers throughout the country especially the Southwest. The lawyer without actually saying the words lets Carlos know that the cheapest quickest way to handle things is to simply let himself be deported then come back across the border as soon as he can. Deportation it seems is hardly the answer especially when the deportees family members are left behind in the United States.Bichir already a superstar in his native Mexico (U.S. audiences know him from Showtimes Weeds and as Fidel Castro in the two-part movie Che) gives an astonishingly layered affecting performance as Carlos letting us see right into the mans loving and tortured soul.Julian just 16 when the movie was filmed makes his film debut with A Better Life and its a sure bet well be seeing more of him. Hes a natural expertly expressing the tug of war between Luis father and his Mexican roots and his understandable desire to fit into his American culture even if that culture is mostly violent and lawless.In a summer full of superheroes and planetary invasions A Better Life focuses on smaller everyday heroes and situations. Youll remember this film long after that green lantern has lost its glow.A Better LifeA Starring Demian Bichir Jose Julian Eddie ""Piolin"" Sotelo and Dolores Heredia. Directed by Chris Weitz.

Before his recent detours into big-budget fantasy franchises with The Golden Compass and Twilight New Moon Weitzs sensibilities often skewed comedic partnering with brother Paul to co-produce co-direct and/or co-write American Pie American Dreamz and the sublime About a Boy. The closest this film comes to any of those is a scene in which two girls belt out a song in their living room with plenty of sass much to the delight of their family members several of whom are heavily tattooed gangbangers. In that moment its American Dreamz by way of the American dream. When Luis (Jose Julian) first meets these local hoods he and a friend are equally tempted by the possibility of dropping out of school and joining up and once he sees their secure family interactions it seems like an even more tempting alternative to his current home life. Mom is out of the picture -- not dead just gone -- which means his father Carlos (Demian Bichir) is either exhausted on the couch or off doing landscaping work just to make ends meet. Unbeknownst to Luis Carlos is at a crossroads if he could somehow afford his boss offer to sell their work truck it comes with his client list to boot. But if Carlos gets caught driving without a license he will likely end up deported to Mexico leaving Luis behind in California with his aunt. We know this cant end well and if youve seen 1948s Bicycle Thieves then you know what happens next Carlos livelihood gets stolen right from under him leaving father and son to scour Los Angeles for the precious truck and bond in the process. Weitz and screenwriter Eric Eason dont dodge every cliche of urban pressures and cultural representation; from the moment Luis and his friend discuss the prospect of joining a gang its apparent that at least one will give in and a painfully distinct sampling of minorities wind up depicted in a montage as Carlos rides home from Beverly Hills to East L.A. Its the stuff that bleeding heart op-ed columns are made of but thankfully a parade of handy heritage (""Oh look Weve got time to enjoy this rodeo"") isnt all that A Better Life has to offer. Though Julian is convincingly whiny and ungrateful in the films early stages as he and Carlos spend an increasing amount of screen time together their passive/aggressive rapport makes his performance easier to tolerate. The real standout is Bichir (Che) delivering a pitch-perfect performance of determination defeat and pride. In the face of great odds and opposite his young co-stars less nuanced turn Carlos remains a steadfast individual whose struggles to survive become increasingly worthy of our emotional investment and remarkably universal in their implications. Subtlety may not be Weitzs strong suit especially whenever the dialogue takes a turn toward openly espousing about the American dream but the thorough sincerity of the father-son relationship and generally subdued depiction of class struggle ultimately keep this film more in line with intimate character studies like The Visitor and less like self-important social commentaries such as Under the Same Moon.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 24 2011 Save for later Saved Jose Julian (l.) and Demian Bichir are shown in a scene from A Better Life. Merrick Morton/Summit Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of With all the heated and sometimes hateful controversy surrounding the issue of illegal immigration in the United States its depressingly easy to lose sight of the fact that illegal aliens are people not statistics. They are both omnipresent and especially if one chooses not to look invisible and no more so than in southern California the setting for Chris Weitzs ""A Better Life"" about a single father who exists under the radar and dreams the American dream.Very few American movies have dealt with the experience of illegals - ""El Norte"" (the best of them) ""The Border"" and ""The Visitor"" are probably the best known. As a result much of ""A Better Life"" has a built-in fascination that carries us through its rough spots. With a modicum of melodrama it focuses on a world that is relatively new to movies. Several scenes set in the barrios of East Los Angeles or at a visiting Mexican rodeo have an admirable semidocumentary realism. Eric Easons script is sometimes unduly contrived and derivative but we are always aware that something larger is being played out.Carlos (Demian Bichir) who works as a gardeners helper lives with his 14-year-old son Luis (Jose Julian) in a rundown apartment in East L.A. He sleeps on the couch so that Luis can have a comfortable bed and be fresh for school even though Luis a good student when he wants to be often skips classes to hang out with his other truant friends. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? When Blasco (the wonderful Joaquin Cosio) who owns the lawn business decides to go back to Mexico he offers to sell Carlos his truck and equipment. Since Carlos has no drivers license - and because a routine traffic violation could result in deportation for him - he is reluctant at first. Eventually he takes up his sisters generous offer of a loan and buys the truck. A new world opens up to him until on his first day - well if youve ever seen the great De Sica neorealist masterpiece ""Bicycle Thieves"" youll have no trouble figuring out what comes next. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The resemblance to De Sicas film is a bit closer than an homage if something less than a rip-off. Still its a functional story device even though the movie we keep being reminded of is one of the greatest ever made while ""A Better Life"" is just solidly OK. As Carlos and Luis comb the barrio and South Central L.A. in search of the stolen truck they slowly bond. Or rather Luis bonds with his father. Carloss love for his son is never in doubt. His prime motivation for buying the truck and risking everything was simple He wants to move his son into a better neighborhood and away from the gangs the boy has so far tenuously resisted.The film captures the ways in which Luis who is Americanized rejects his fathers old-school ways. This rejection would probably have happened even without the complication of illegal immigration; its a staple of generational and adolescent conflict. But because Bichir is such a quietly forceful presence Carlos is continually favored by the camera in his encounters with Luis who displays a violent streak that the film never comes to terms with. The father-son emotional trajectory is too easily plotted - we can see where things are headed early on - and yet it still hits home.I wish ""A Better Life"" had moved further away from its comfort zone. If Carlos wasnt so reliably salt of the earth if Luis had shown himself to be more explosively disturbed the film would have resembled less a recruitment poster for tolerance. But there are sequences here like the ones involving men massing for work on street corners or working the night shift washing dishes that highlight a closed-off society too often neglected in the movies - not to mention in real life.

This is a genre in which work -- exhausting repetitive unreliable -- is the storys engine and the characters sole means of survival. For the characters in these films holding on to a job or finding a better one takes precedence over anything life can throw at them. For Carlos (Demian Bichir) an undocumented Mexican day laborer who arrived in Los Angeles six years earlier work is all-consuming. Rising at dawn in his ramshackle South Central rental he spends long days tending to the well-fed lawns of the affluent barely seeing his 14-year-old son Luis (Jose Julian). Uncommunicative and a little hotheaded Luis is teetering on the brink of expulsion from school and initiation into a local gang with family ties to his feisty girlfriend (Chelsea Rendon) but its clear hes more a thoughtful loner than a mindless joiner. When in the course of a single day Carlos achieves his dream of self-employment only to have it cruelly snatched away the film transforms into an odyssey of familial healing and a sharp lesson on the realities of living without papers. As Carlos and Luis search for the man who has wronged them director Chris Weitz (whose family is mostly Hispanic and whose grandmother was the Mexican actress Lupita Tovar) takes us on a tour of locations most Angelenos never see An immigrant doss house a Mexican rodeo at Pico Rivera Stadium a steamy kitchen filled with undocumented scullery staff. Dragging into the light those who prefer to exist in shadows Weitz forces us to confront a world where every stranger is a threat every cop an enemy and crime must be handled without official help. Sensitively written by Eric Eason (from a story by Roger L. Simon) A Better Life is a far cry from the directors big-studio footprints (The Twilight Saga New Moon and The Golden Compass) but the more personal scale suits him. Turning LA into a bifurcated city -- on one side manicured yards and jogging suburbanites on the other noisy cantinas and loitering gangbangers -- Javier Aguirresarobes photography draws texture from the street life that boils in the background of the frame. Adopting a uniformly downbeat tone Weitz observes without comment resisting the impulse to dramatize the snatches of political protest or the desperate men scrambling on corners for a days work. Like most of the citys residents the film simply glances and moves on. i The entire film is told through the perspective of illegal immigrants like Santiago (Carlos Linares left) and Carlos (Bichir).

Director Chris Weitz tours locations even most Angelenos never see. Merrick Morton/Summit Entertainment Unfolding exclusively from the perspective of illegal immigrants A Better Life is a dignified decent film. Neither hopeful nor hopeless the story is about embracing heritage while striving for more all the while trying not to step on the neck of your brother. And despite glaring similarities to Italian neo-realist classic Bicycle Thieves and the occasional lapse into triteness -- like the soaring music that accompanies Carlos as he scales a palm tree and gazes in aspirational awe at the beauty around him -- the film counters soapiness with lead performances of remarkable depth and synchronicity. Equally pleasing is Weitzs refusal to highlight the integrity of his hero by painting the films gang members as de facto monsters. Instead he stages his warmest most delightful scene in the cozy home of Luiss girlfriend where two tiny prima donnas sing for their tattooed relatives. Its easy to see why to a lonely boy this family feels more real than his own.

"A Better Life illuminates lives lived in the shadows - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather A Better Life illuminates lives lived in the shadows By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Posted | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions No matter where you stand on immigration A Better Life is must-see viewing poignantly revealing what its like living confined to the shadows of contemporary society. By Merrick Morton Summit Entertainment Son and father Jose Julian left and Demian Bichir strive for a better life in Los Angeles. EnlargeClose By Merrick Morton Summit Entertainment Son and father Jose Julian left and Demian Bichir strive for a better life in Los Angeles. The story is about the lengths a parent will travel -- literally and figuratively -- to provide his child the best opportunities. Its not overtly political. But it shines a light on neighborhoods many drive past and chronicles people who often go unseen by choice and circumstance. The movie takes a probing look at one immigrants story through a lens of humanity. Watching this gently profound film could help lawmakers reach a more clear-eyed understanding of a thorny problem. VIDEO Preview A Better Life Carlos (Demian Bichir) is a hard-working Mexican-born gardener who does his best to fly under the radar of the authorities living in fear of being stopped for a minor offense and facing deportation. In every other sense hes law-abiding and staunchly ethical. Laboring long hours on a Los Angeles gardening crew Carlos has singlehandedly raised his only son Luis (Jose Julian) 14. His wife left when Luis was very young and Carlos has quietly carried on. We see the daily rigors of Carlos job tending lawns and risking peril to trim the towering palm trees of people far more fortunate. Meanwhile Luis has begun to drift away drawn to a local gang. He looks down on his father regarding his work as servile. Nevertheless Carlos sleeps on the couch in their one-bedroom apartment so Luis can have the bed and get enough rest to do well in school. Spurred by the desire to protect Luis from gang influences Carlos takes a financial risk investing what little he has to buy a truck and start his own gardening business. Things take a bad turn and all Carlos has worked for is jeopardized. Carlos and Luis team up to rectify things and in the process come to understand each other. Illustrative details make a powerful impression. A Mexican ""charro"" show adds a vibrant element of authenticity and an appealing Latin-flavored score by Alexandre Desplat beautifully accents the story. But the bravura performances set the film apart. Bichir (the scary druglord Esteban on Showtimes Weeds) is pitch-perfect as the humble Carlos. He brings a subtle grace and dignity as well as heartwrenching sadness to the role. Newcomer Julian 16 when he made the movie is wonderfully natural as Luis -- sullen when the part calls for it but with a core of nobility. The screenplay by Eric Eason is deftly realized by director Chris Weitz (About a Boy). Weitz is a versatile director who can segue smoothly from big-budget movies like The Twilight Saga New Moon to this modest character-driven film. In his impeccably structured tale Weitz conveys the ever-present anxiety underlying the determination of people in a precarious situation. His compassionate portrait imbues the world it illuminates with sympathy but never pity. Nor does it turn ordinary people into glossy heroes. By focusing on the personal -- a father intent on making his sons life better -- this moving film rings universally true. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Good performances and a look at lesser-known corners of Los Angeles are the big assets in this drama about an illegal Mexican alien (Demian Bichir Castro in ""Che"") and his lazy 14-year-old son (newcomer Jose Julian) directed with subtlety by Chris Weitz whose rap sheet includes such overblown blockbusters as ""New Moon"" and ""The Golden Compass."" In a nod to the Italian neo-realist classic ""The Bicycle Thief"" Eric Easons script centers on the single dads truck being stolen the very first day he goes into business for himself as a landscaper for more prosperous Angelenos. Because dad cant go to the cops the son -- who has been flirting with gang involvement -- bonds with dad in the quest to get the truck back. Weitz keeps the schmaltz in check but its clear pretty much from the outset that this immigrant family is fated never to find ""A Better Life"" north of the border.

(Handout) BY Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Friday June 24 2011 400 AM ""IF A TREE FALLS"" - 3 STARSChronicle of an accused eco-terrorist. (125). Not rated Mature themes. At the IFC. All of Marshall Currys documentaries (including the Oscar-nominated ""Street Fight"") offer intelligent sympathetic takes on worthy subjects. Though his latest falls a bit short in its range theres still plenty here to keep viewers riveted.  Curry focuses on Daniel McGowan a former member of the radical environmental collective Earth Liberation Front. The son of an NYPD officer McGowan is as the movie begins an accused eco-terrorist and under house arrest. Curry and co-director Sam Cullman ask many valuable questions about notions of terrorism political activism and personal responsibility. And they uncover challenging answers to match. But despite their efforts to address most sides of this complex story each new interview leaves us wanting to know even more. Of course thats the sign of a compelling film -- but in this case not an altogether satisfying one. ""A BETTER LIFE"" - 3 STARSAn immigrant father finds obstacles at every turn. (138). PG-13 Violence language. At the Lincoln Square Sunshine. With its careful compositions and message-minded dialogue Chris Weitzs modest drama feels more earnest than real. Still its sincerity is admirable and often touching.Mexican superstar Demian Bichir plays Carlos Galindo an illegal immigrant desperate to give his teenage son Luis (Jose Julian) everything he lacked an education security maybe even happiness. Theyre on the right track until some terrible luck threatens all his hard work.   While this intimate story--an update on Vittorio De Sicas Italian classic ""The Bicycle Thief""--is a far cry from Weitzs previous efforts (""About a Boy"" ""New Moon"") it retains the polish of a Hollywood film. Even so compassionate intentions and the chemistry between its leads ultimately overcome the too-slick sentimentality. ""LEAP YEAR"" - 3 STARSFictional portrait of an isolated woman. (134). Not rated Nudity sex violence. In Spanish with subtitles. At Cinema Village.A far cry from 2010s shallow rom-com of the same name this ""Leap Year"" is a haunting portrait of loneliness in its starkest state.Monica del Carmen is tragically believable as Laura a young woman whos moved away from her family for the excitement of life in Mexico City. Despite the lies she tells them things arent going as planned she spends all day in her empty apartment and at night she picks up strangers so she wont sleep alone. Her emptiness finds the ideal companion in Arturo (Gustavo Sanchez Parra) whose penchant for sexual sadism meshes with Lauras masochistic misery.A confident debut from writer/director Michael Rowe but not an easy one to watch for your own sanity you might not want to see it alone.

"A Better Life movie review Earnestness isnt enough |       NJ.com comments A Better Life movie review Earnestness isnt enough Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 24 2011 at 604 AM View/Post Comments Summit EntertainmentJose Julian left and Demian Bichir as a teen and his father in ""A Better Life."" A Better Life movie review The new ""A Better Life"" is a little bit of ""The Bicycle Thief"" a little bit of a barrio melodrama and a little bit of the sort of do-good entertainment that used to be called ""a problem film."" At its best though its still problematic. To its credit the movie is one of the rare modern ones with a strong father figure at its core -- in this case Carlos a Los Angeles day laborer and single parent who is working hard to raise his teenage son. He sees a rare chance when a pickup truck and a full set of gardening equipment come up for sale. If he can scrape together enough money for the purchase he may finally be able to get ahead. And so he takes a huge gamble and buys in to the American dream. And then watches it turn into a nightmare when the truck is stolen. Complicating things is that Carlos is in this country illegally. He cant go to the police for help. All he can do is scour the streets looking for his lost chance trying desperately to hold on to even this bottom rung on the ladder to a bigger future. The film is directed by Chris Weitz who once did the very fine ""About a Boy"" (and whose grandmother was the silent-era Mexican star Lupita Tovar). He clearly has a feel for this sort of family material and a connection to this culture. His approach -- with cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe who has done wonderful work on everything from the ""Twilight"" films to Alejandro Amenabars ""The Sea Inside"" -- is careful and methodical. Shots arent rushed and are strongly composed. Montages of different Los Angeles street scenes lend color and life. Mexican star Demian Bichir is equally composed as Carlos. As frantic as he feels he keeps his emotions in check; his illegal status has taught him to be ""invisible"" he explains. Yet that coiled intensity -- like Robert De Niros -- only attracts our attention more fiercely. Movie novice Jose Julian though isnt nearly as successful as Carlos son Luis unable to do anything with this character but show us a sullen and ungrateful teen. And the scenes of Luis flirtation with the gang life feel forced; you never get any real sense of the attraction or the danger it holds for him. So we come to concentrate on Carlos which may be why the last third of the movie -- as he inevitably runs afoul of immigration -- makes the first two-thirds feel like a set-up. Is this why we spent an hour being shown what a saint he is? Just to prepare us for some rather vague criticism of immigration laws? There are some impassioned moments here and some striking ones -- mostly in the films constant illustration of just how segregated modern Los Angeles is. But mostly this is a film made up of earnest concern and good intentions -- and thats never a substitute for real drama and strong convictions. Ratings note The film contains scenes of violence and alcohol abuse. A Better Life (PG-13) Summit (98 min.) Directed by Chris Weitz. With Demian Bichir Jose Julian. In English and Spanish with English subtitles. Now playing in New York.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> You dont expect the director of the bloodsucking bore The Twilight Saga New Moon and the epic flop The Golden Compass to deliver the raw emotional power that permeates A Better Life. On the surface the film seems like one of those docudramas that beg to be rewarded solely for their good intentions. But Chris Weitz cuts deep in this tale of Carlos Galindo (Demian Bichir) a Mexican gardener living illegally as a single dad in East Los Angeles and trying to keep his teen son (the excellent Jose Julian) from being sucked into local gangs. Weitz of Mexican ancestry doesnt use the script (by Eric Eason) to build a pulpit. He lets his story grow in force by focusing on telling details (like the theft of the truck that allows Carlos to make a living a nod to Vittorio De Sicas classic The Bicycle Thief) and on the monumental performance of Bichir (Castro in Che and Mary-Louise Parkers lover in Weeds) who lets us into the mind and heart of a man most of us walk past and never see.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Much as with Holocaust movies it occasionally seems like there are no new ways to approach the story of Mexican immigrants illegally working in America. Undocumented workers are a contentious subject and films about them tend to follow established lines of compromise acknowledging that theyre breaking laws then compensating by framing them as longsuffering saintly martyrs. With A Better Life director Chris Weitz (coming back from the big-budget hells of The Golden Compass and The Twilight Saga New Moon) and screenwriter Eric Eason find a new filter for those familiar signifiers by essentially remaking Vittorio De Sicas 1948 classic Bicycle Thieves. In the process they drop a lot of De Sicas neo-realist focus on detail while losing none of the strong performances or heartbreaking suffering. Demian Bichir stars as an overburdened single father working as a landscaper in east L.A. struggling to support his teenage son (Jose Julian) a troubled boy close to falling in with the local gangs. Bichirs boss is about to retire which mandates a choice buy the boss truck and go into business for himself or return to hustling for jobs among the local day-work hopefuls hanging out at the local plant nursery. After an emotional struggle--he doesnt have a drivers license or insurance and would rather keep his head down and ""stay invisible"" than take risks--Bichir borrows money to buy the truck. But his need is so great the truck is so precious and tragedy is so obviously waiting in the wings that the film almost chokes under its own foreboding. A Better Life leans too heavily on sad music broad symbols and weighty speeches to tell its story; its more effective when it lets images speak in place of words. All Bichirs monologues about his hopes for his sons future arent as moving as his expressive face when he endures Julians frequent bouts of adolescent contempt or his unremarked-upon habit of sleeping on the living-room couch so Julian can have a room and a bed to himself. Still Bichir and Julian both give remarkable performances bringing across all the dichotomies that define their relationship--anger vs. acceptance selfishness vs. compassion mutual frustration vs. mutual love--in a more convincing way than the script seems to allow. As the impatient disgruntled Julian comes to see how much worse his life could be and realizes how much of his fathers sense of humor and honor hes taken for granted A Better Life becomes increasingly powerful over time. Its a familiar story retold in the form of another familiar story but powerfully expressed emotions always feel fresh and vital in the moment no matter how many times theyve been expressed before.

Simon; Release Date Limited 06/24/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 98; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted June 28 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT Dramas about illegal immigrants have often focused on the journey north -- an odyssey pocked with exploitation and fear but one that generally ends on a note of road-weary triumph. In A Better Life however the focus is on the plight of undocumented immigrants who are already ensconced in the United States. Carlos (Demian Bichir) an unassuming gardener came up from Mexico years ago and made a home in Los Angeles but to call anything about his existence ""settled"" would be an exaggeration. His wife frustrated by his modest ambitions left him long ago and the son hes raised on his own Luis (Jose Julian) is a sullen teenager increasingly drawn to the tattooed allure of gang life. Carlos must keep his head down literally and emotionally but anyone who looks at him and sees a meek pleading recessive man isnt reading between the lines of Demian Bichirs superb slow simmer of a performance. His Carlos is a silent striver who like the heroes of The Bicycle Thief and Man Push Cart embodies a humanity that is ultimately heartbreaking. Its no cheap irony when Carlos attempt to improve his and his sons lot leads him down a rabbit hole of misfortune. He agrees to take over a colleagues gardening business (chief asset a truck) but being an owner turns out to be a lot more treacherous than being an anonymous day worker. When the truck is stolen Carlos claws and schemes to get it back. The struggle draws him closer to his son but risks bringing his undocumented status to the attention of the law. A Better Life was directed by the eclectic Chris Weitz (The Twilight Saga New Moon About a Boy) who weaves the torpor and anxiety of immigrant life into something dramatically true if at moments a bit draggy. By the time Carlos confronts a choice he prayed hed never have to make the film has put a face on lives we too often feel free to judge without knowing.

"Chris Weitzs A Better Life Raises The Bar For Summer Movies | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Movie Review Chris Weitzs A Better Life Raises The Bar For Summer Movies By Rex Reed  06/21/11 802pm Demian Bichir in <i>A Better Life</i>. This week I saw one good movie and two unspeakable piles of garbage. From where I sit thats a pretty fair average for the summer. And I didnt even see the one about Jim Carrey and the penguins. The one to catch is A Better Life an intelligent heartfelt study of the Olympian daily struggles of an honest hard-working single father who also happens to be an illegal immigrant toiling as a Mexican gardener in Los Angeles while doing everything he can to keep his head above water and protect his 14-year-old son from the toxic environment of the ghettos in East L.A. Working from a careful balanced script by Eric Eason the director is Chris Weitz son of the late fashion designer John Weitz and the stunning actress Susan Kohner. Having already shown great promise as an actor (Chuck and Buck) and director (sharing credit with his brother Paul on About a Boy) he hits his stride with A Better Life an earnest uncluttered and thoroughly realistic portrait of what its really like to be down and out in Beverly Hills. You see them leathered by the California sun with eyes dark as black olives trimming and shaping the hedges that guard the estates of bankers and movie stars like leafy sentinels planting purple bougainvillea scaling ratty palm trees with safety belts around their paunchy guts--faceless outsiders in Xanadu like the monkey soldiers in Oz working impossible hours for slave wages to beautify the lawns and prune the ivy of the rich and famous who treat them with indifference and rarely even glance at their faces tipping them once a year if theyre lucky with a case of Corona Lite. You wonder where they go at night how they live. The best their children can ever hope for is mowing grass or repairing car engines. How can they keep the American dream alive if theyre not even American citizens themselves? This is the story of one man who tries. Carlos (played by renowned Mexican star Demian Bichir) instills in his son Luis (Jose Julian an American actor making his debut) the importance of an education but when his back is turned the boy is always being tempted by the lure of street gangs in the barrio who make money from petty crimes. Determined to be a decent trustworthy and respectable person Carlos betters himself by borrowing his sisters hard-earned life savings to buy a truck that will ease his work load double his income and pay off his debts. When the truck is stolen on the first day on the job and sold on the black market the desperate old man and his compassionate kid are forced to test the principles of honesty and fair play and two generations come together in unexpected ways to forge a new relationship. The parallels between A Better Life and Vittorio De Sicas postwar 1948 classic The Bicycle Thief are unmistakable as Mr. Weitz details the poverty gangs police harassment and survival techniques of immigrants trying to remain invisible in order to escape arrest and deportation. This is a theme that has been explored before but never with this much harrowing nuance and poignancy. The red tape and emotional turmoil immigrants go through to make a contribution to the country they adopt is wrenching enough to make you ask hard questions of the U.S. immigration laws and the hostile cruel and often criminal government employees who enforce them (sometimes resorting to blackmail). Avoiding the detritus of politics that could confuse its audience the film presents no clear villains and makes no demands for reform but there is no question whose side the viewer will be on when Carloss luck runs out while he tries to save himself from jail and his teenage son from a bleak future at the mercy of predators on the streets of Los Angeles without paternal guidance. Working in both English and Spanish with subtitles Mr. Bichir is nothing less than perfect. In his sensitive portrayal of the kind and rational Carlos the planes of his face seem salted by hard labor and determination showing the dilemma of a man forced to break the law in order to stand up for his rights as a human being. In the lines of his face and the tears in his eyes you dont need to overanalyze outdated laws. The simplicity of the straightforward narrative provides its own morality and the film engages the senses and rivets attention because it is less about preachy soapbox amendments and more about the definition of family values when the odds are against you. Mr. Weitz never makes the same film twice. This time aided immeasurably by first-rate actors marvelous cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe and low-key but dramatically surging mood music by Alexandre Desplat he gives us food for thought about the despair of good people without documents without whom America could not function and the apathy of the privileged classes that benefit from their sweat the most without lifting a finger to help them. The ""better life"" in the title ends up in the bigger picture benefitting us all. The power in this movie is the way Chris Weitz trusts us to discover the facts for ourselves. rreedobserver.com A BETTER LIFE Running time 98 minutes Written by Eric Eason Directed by Chris Weitz Starring Demian Bichir Jose Julian 3/4 Comment Filed under Chris Weitz Movie Review Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/06/chris-weitzs-a-better-life-raises-the-bar-for-summer-movies/,200,abetterlife25,abetterlife,observer

When not tending the lawns of affluent Angelenos undocumented Mexican Carlos (Demian Bichir who played Castro in Che) sleeps on the living-room couch of the tiny East L.A. home he shares with his moody 14-year-old layabout son Luis (an unsteady Jose Julian making his big-screen debut) still nursing deep hurt over the mother who abandoned him when he was a toddler. Carlos hopes his economic situation will improve once he buys a truck and goes into business for himself; when the vehicle is stolen by someone living even more precariously Luis joins his father in tracking it down--a plot development that provides the pretext for hoary parent-child rapprochement though relieving us of the more tiresome thread of the kids consideration of gang membership. The third act finds Carlos behind bars at an ICE detainee center where grim facts about what awaits most illegal immigrants are awkwardly shoehorned in--truths quickly eclipsed by the tears father and son will share. But director Chris Weitz and screenwriter Eric Eason are unable to commit fully even to this sudsy vision tacking on a coda that completely undermines their already timid message.

In the swift wordless opening sequence the director reveals the life of sullen middle-aged gardener Carlos (Demian Bichir) living out his days as an impoverished illegal immigrant in Los Angeles. The credit sequence encapsulates an entire 12-hour period in Carlos life from waking up on his living room couch to toiling away in the heat and then back to his claustrophobic abode as dusk sets in. Later he endures the frustrating task of soliciting Americans for work on the side of the road finding respite when a fellow Mexican lifts his spirits. Again actions speak louder than words as Weisz turns up the soundtrack and simply shows the two men brighten up. These are smartly observed snapshots of humanity. However when the stakes in Carlos life keep going up and his hopes for improving conditions for himself and his estranged teenage son Luis (Jose Julian) start to fade ""A Better Life"" loses its pull. The story teeters on the edge between bearable family drama and unimaginative sensationalism before eventually jumping off the cliff into a bucket of tears. Its an unfortunate plunge that happens with ease. Weitz flirts with greatness but unfortunately misses the opportunity to make the material soar. And yet he comes close. Fresh from the erratic blockbuster experiences of directing ""The Golden Compass"" and the second ""Twilight"" movie Weitz has chosen material that requires no expensive trickery or even star power to get its point across. That sort of retreat is always interesting to watch and in this case it begs for attention. ""A Better Life"" indulges in a steady amount of understatement whereas neither ""The Golden Compass"" or ""Twilight New Moon"" had any. More significantly ""A Better Life"" blatantly retreats from the uglier aspects of commercial allure by assuming a uniformly immigrant perspective. Unlike Tom McCarthys ""The Visitor"" Weiszs project provides no basic focal point for broader audiences through the appearance of a white character plagued by white person guilt. (""The Visitor"" has plenty of virtues but the way its immigrant couple are seen through the eyes of an old vanilla professorial type couldnt have hurt its popularity.) Despite the distinctive arrangement of characters however ""A Better Life"" delves into a conventional scenario from the very beginning. Growing up in a single parent household (his parents divorced years ago) Luis routinely finds himself in trouble in school and sports a moody persona that threatens to bring him into gang life. His dad just wants to do honest work and improve the quality of their existence. He tries to be a stern father figure. ""You wanna end up like me?"" he asks Luis who just rolls his eyes. Even though they butt heads Carlos and Luis harbor a mutual trust that makes their opportunity to bond inevitable. When Carlos runs into problems with a local thief father and son join forces to set things right. Even this rudimentary progression works due to the chemistry between the actors and particularly Bichir (Fidel Castro in Steven Soderberghs ""Che"") in a sharply focused performance. Without a doubt ""A Better Life"" forms Weiszs most assured adult work (his other credits include ""About a Boy"" and ""Down to Earth"" both co-directed with brother Paul). Nevertheless it owes a lot of its initial momentum to Eric Easons unhurried screenplay which builds toward a daring climax that brings Carlos and Luis closer together while putting joint in jeopardy. But after a discerning opener ""A Better Life"" falters by concluding with a sigh. Carlos delivers a weepy monologue about family bonds and personal yearning an unfortunate departure from the restraint in the earlier scenes. Carlos meeting with a statstics-touting immigration officer wanders into unnecessarily didactic turf. Its a frustrating misstep that the filmmaker chooses to tell instead of show the drama when he has already demonstrated an understanding of the classic dictum that just showing can speak volumes. HOW WILL IT PLAY? In the capable hands of distributor Summit Entertainment ""A Better Life"" is poised to land solid reviews and enough niche appeal to do some decent business in limited release but its too slight to gain much momentum beyond that. criticWIRE grade B- This Article is related to Reviews and tagged In Theaters More From IndieWireHow to Scare Yourself Shtless This Halloween A Viewers Guide (VIDEO)Exclusive Aja Naomi King Talks About Sci-Fi Thriller Reversion and the Power of Memories - Now in TheatersTwo Limited Release Films Also Opening This Weekend That You Might Be Interested in Seeing...Here Are All the Movies Opening Today January 9.

An undocumented worker seeks ""A Better Life"" for himself and his troubled teenage son only to find that good intentions have a way of going awry. Thats also the moral inadvertently offered up by director Chris Weitzs problematic new picture which despite Demian Bichirs affecting lead performance and a strong feel for Los Angeles Mexican-American communities emerges an earnest and overly programmatic heart-tugger. Still assuming the pics topicality accessibility and specific appeal to Hispanic audiences result in good specialty returns Summit could push this hard-luck immigrant fable further into the mainstream spotlight than usual for low-budget minority-focused fare. A Mexican-born L.A.-based gardener who crossed the border illegally years ago single dad Carlos Galindo (Bichir) works hard as a day laborer taking odd jobs for affluent Angelenos whose well-tended homes and lawns provide a taste of the ever-elusive American dream. His struggles to make ends meet go mostly unappreciated by his son Luis (Jose Julian) a sullen distant kid susceptible to gang influences at school. Their situation seems to improve when Carlos sister (Delores Heredia) lends him the money to buy a truck off his friend (Joaquin Cosio) allowing Carlos to work as an independent contractor. But in one of the films crueler tougher-minded developments the truck is soon stolen shattering Carlos dreams of a new livelihood and leaving him with a debt he has no way of repaying. From here the film becomes a detective story of sorts with a clear debt to ""Bicycle Thieves"" as Carlos unable to go to the police searches for the truck with a suddenly helpful Luis. Their journey takes them all over the city from a cramped South Central apartment to a Mexican rodeo at Pico Rivera Sports Arena to a kitchen where day laborers wash dishes by night. Naturally father and son bond along the way despite their polar-opposite worldviews Trusting compassionate Carlos sees the good in every soul they encounter while shrewd cynical Luis at times reveals a violent streak especially alarming for a kid his age. After ""The Golden Compass"" and ""The Twilight Saga New Moon"" it must have been a relief for Weitz to scale back with a slice of character-driven socially conscious filmmaking that favors humanism over politics. While the result bears little resemblance to those recent big-budget fantasies or the earlier studio comedies Weitz directed with his brother Paul (""About a Boy"" ""Down to Earth"") the studio polish that has informed the helmers past work also persists here smoothing over the rough edges and ambiguities that would have given the film the realist texture its clearly aiming for. Much of that texture was present in Easons assured 2002 writing-directing debut ""Manito"" another tale of a fractured Latino family trying to make it in urban America; his scenario here feels more diagrammed and on-the-nose in its handling of plot and characterization and the central relationship while engaging enough never fully earns its final assault on the viewers tear ducts. Tension-milking scenes in which Luis feels pressured to join his crime-inclined friends (Bobby Soto Chelsea Rendon) are especially unpersuasive in their attempts at ghetto realism. Bichir is effortlessly sympathetic as a man who whatever his legal status is clearly a model citizen and a loving father yet the veteran thesp finally feels as shackled by his nobly downbeat trajectory as Carlos is by his circumstances. Julian has a more difficult time with a flintier role though its to the younger thesps credit that he doesnt bother making Luis especially likable. Sets costumes and well-chosen locations furnish evocative views of a Los Angeles rarely seen in mainstream cinema and early glimpses of Carlos routine waiting in line with other laborers or grabbing a quick meal from a taco truck are a nice touch. A soundtrack pulsing with Latin-inflected hip-hop (with an original Ozomatli song played over the closing credits) balances out a somewhat incongruous musical score.

TWITTER By keeping things simple and understated director Chris Weitz and screenwriter Eric Eason have crafted a little gem where humanity is observed with compassion not condescension. The Bicycle Thief directed by Vittorio De Sica and written by Cesare Zavattini in 1948 long considered one of the classic films of Italian neo-realism tells the story of a poor man and his son. Their search for a stolen bicycle the father desperately needs for work becomes a journey that explores poverty and desperation. A Better Life from the always surprising director Chris Weitz employs the same strategy to open up the lives of a Mexican gardener in East Los Angeles and his Americanized son. Their search for a truck becomes an odyssey of powerlessness and anxiety that creates greater understanding between father and son who are virtually unaware of each others lives. Meanwhile the movie tracks the hard reality of what it means to be without documents in American society. By keeping things simple and understated Weitz and screenwriter Eric Eason (working from a Roger L. Simon story) have crafted a little gem where humanity is observed with compassion not condescension. You dont make a film like this expecting the kind of grosses Weitzs films such as New Moon orAbout a Boygenerated. But with targeted marketing and promotions Summit Entertainment could have a modest box-office hit in A Better Life following its L.A. Film Festival premiere. Who knows -- it may even pick up a nomination or award at years end. Veteran Mexican actor Demian Bichir plays Carlos an illegal immigrant whose wife long ago abandoned him to raise their young son by himself. While the two havent exactly prospered they get by in borderline poverty with Luis (Jose Julian) going to school -- sometimes -- and more or less staying out of trouble with gangs-- so far -- while Carlos scrapes together money as a helper to a gardener with steady clients. Only now his boss wants to return to Mexico and offers to sell him the truck with all its gardening equipment. Carlos problem as it has always been is he has no drivers license. Any stop by a cop will quickly confirm his undocumented status. Plus he doesnt begin to have the money to buy the truck. Hopes get cruelly raised then dashed when his sister loans Carlos enough money to purchase the truck only for it to disappear the first day on the job. His search for the thief with Luis a reluctant companion takes them into gang territory and into contact with strangers with possible ulterior motivations. Its an odyssey that examines many aspects of the human condition law enforcement street predators recklessness and the meaning of family. There is in fact an entire movie going on in the background when its characters travel through the megalopolis that is L.A. by foot bus or the truck itself police activity political rallies gangbangers guys looking for work and women bringing home meager supplies are picked up by Weitzs observant camera. What is unusual here for an American movie whether from the studios or indie filmmakers is its willingness to let the movie speak for itself. There is a rich life on display here but the makers trust a viewer to discover it for himself. The relationship between father and son rests at times as much on what they dont say as what they do. The two males are very different from one another and their different upbringings only partly account for this. Carlos deeds more than his words impact his son but not always in positive ways. Luis is American enough to see violence as the easy remedy; Carlos long ago learned the pitfalls of ""easy."" As the search for the thief and then the truck gets them deeper into troubling areas and tension mounts the two winds up seeing each others point of view. But such understanding may come too late to save the family. Fine and seldom seel L.A. locations peerless cinematography by Spanish d.p. Javier Aguirresarobe a perceptive production designer from Missy Stewart and an unobtrusive Latin-flavored score from the tireless Alexandre Desplat let the moods and environment of the movie seep into a viewers consciousness. Nothing here is overt; everything the enigmas and contradictions of life is subtle and simply portrayed.
