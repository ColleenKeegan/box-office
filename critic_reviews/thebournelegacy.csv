That the movie turned out as well as it has is a tribute to co-writer and director Tony Gilroy (who worked on all three previous films in the series) and Jeremy Renner who is perfectly cast in the lead. The results may not be perfect but theyre good enough to provide the kind of action and storytelling that Bourne fans expect. Jeremy Renner has earned his way to this high-profile part doing exceptional work since his vault to widespread recognition in The Hurt Locker. He has the required intensity and physicality to make his character--a highly-trained genetically enhanced undercover agent--completely believable. Whats more hes well matched with leading lady Rachel Weisz. Shes equally credible as a research doctor who like Renner becomes a pawn and potential victim when the powers-that-be turn on the worker bees in their worldwide network. Gilroy (who co-wrote the film with his brother Dan) doesnt skimp on high-octane action from Renners introductory scenes of survival in a snowy wilderness to his violent first meeting with Weisz through a slam-bang chase climax. I dare not describe any of these in detail lest I spoil your fun. Where The Bourne Legacy trips up is in the scenes involving Edward Norton as the cold-blooded ringmaster of that covert U.S. agency. They are so densely written and overloaded with indecipherable jargon that they border on self-parody. Whats more they eat up an awful lot of time in this already lengthy film. (In a downright silly gesture there are ridiculously brief appearances by David Strathairn and Joan Allen which are supposed to strengthen the link between this film and the earlier Bourne stories. The ruse is transparent and unnecessary. But I do need someone to explain why the great Albert Finney turns up for approximately thirty seconds midway through the picture.) On balance the movie works. I wish it werent so long and I could do without some of those scenes with Norton. I also wish so much of the movie werent shot in macro-close-up. (I dont need to count the pores on the actors faces thank you.) But I was entertained especially during those action scenes and at this point in the summer Im more than grateful for that.

I didnt see the point in bring back Joan Allen Albery Finney and David Strathairn as Norton and Stacy Keach were basically just stand-ins for them (really didnt need the tie-in story). I still enjoyed myself as well ceratinly worse films out there but it couldve been a bit better.

A committed performance from Jeremy Renner breathes life into his Bourne-like character Aaron Cross but its harder to identify with this genetically enhanced superspy than with Matt Damons highly trained but emotionally vulnerable agent. In box-office terms the Bourne legacy is safe but there are doubts about its creative sustainability. Exposed by the media fallout from Jason Bournes very public ultimatum Colonel Eric Byer (Edward Norton) orders the immediate termination of the parallel programme Outcome - and its agents. But Aaron Cross survives and goes on the run with Dr Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) a scientist with access to the pills his body craves. Funded by Byers shadowy research group a pharmaceutical company has used behaviour modification to create a new breed of pumped-up hyper-intelligent field agent. Now one of these agents has gone rogue with a civilian female in tow. So its deja vu as Byers team track Cross and the doctor to the Philippines - the exotic location for a string of competently staged action set-pieces. These mildly suspenseful scenes showcase Renners physical agility and screen presence as well as Weiszs talent for credible crying and screaming but they scarcely trouble their respective acting abilities. Particularly irritating are the plot contortions needed to accommodate pointless cameos by familiar faces from the trilogy Paddy Considine Albert Finney and Joan Allen. Not to mention the repeated cryptic flashbacks designed to sketch in Crosss murky military past. It all falls apart during the climactic foot and motorcycle chase which is more exhausting than exciting and features a cypher-like villain who utters not one word of dialogue.

I also didnt claim to be absolutely correct. If you have good reason to claim its new footage say so and Ill happily stand corrected. Or is it because I wrote a few sentences with more than 7 words that youve got all het up by my comment. I really dont give a flying fck if you read my posts or not but do try and at least muster the energy to read up on the point youre so eloquently arguing before arguing it. IMDb Paddy Considines official website perhaps. I did this thing where I read those first before commenting. Or just be brief and obnoxious again. Either or.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 15 2012ChrisFeaturedHey Merrittpr sorry - I wasnt responding to your review ) It was a response to the main article (shoulda made that clear - doh). Youre right it was very similar indeed and its definitely not as good as its predecessors. But I did go in hoping for more-of-the-same...yknow a la the Bond movies. I wasnt hoping for a big change of direction just more of that Bourne tone one man against the system hand to hand combat over gadgetry etc etc. I dont take issue with any one disliking it for the reasons you gave if you were hoping for a new direction and didnt get it sure youd be disappointed. Ive done that with many a film in the past Luckily for me my expectations happened to be at the right level this time. Either way I wasnt arguing with anyone that the films perfect... I just dont like officially published reviews that sound like the reviewer hasnt really watched it properly. That was my gripe.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 15 2012ChrisFeaturedI have to ask have you actually seen the previous Bourne films? I can only infer from your review that you at best glossed over them ahead of having to watch this film. The story takes place at the same time as and shortly after the Bourne Ultimatum. And things happen in that film that directly drive Legacys plot. Your review sounds like you missed the important plot connections. Paddy Considine wasnt in this film at all they used footage from Ultimatum. Again those scenes being vital plot points in this film. There was no contorting of plot to squeeze in Albert Finney.... the character was a key link between the two stories. Tony Gilroy did well to make this link with just one relatively short scene using Finneys Hirsch character as a visual marker point for the audience. Yes they couldve made the connection with just some lengthy dialogue but then Id no doubt have just read a review complaining of how confusing the plot was. Incidentally Joan Allens one scene was a moment of sheer jaw-dropping brilliance...but only if you remember the third film that is. Incidentally you dont mention David Strathairns appearance which was the one reprisal that as nice as it was to see him again wasnt really necessary. And re the silent villain point... that has been the very essence of the Bourne franchise from day one. Barring Clive Owens in Identity none of these villains - or ""assets"" as theyre known in the Bourne world - ever utter a word. Its what they do. This is one of many reviews Ive now read that sound like theyve been written by someone who hasnt seen the previous films and/or not yet come to terms with the fact that it doesnt have Matt Damon in it. Its a shame that reviews like this shape the scores on the aggregate review sites. The fourth film into a franchise really ought to be reviewed by someone who knows and likes the previous films in the series. Or can we expect Skyfall reviews in October by people that dont know Bond?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 15 2012MerrittprFeaturedTo me it was just a combination of the previous Bourne films. I was expecting something new and fresh but it was just a re hash of what had gone on before. If it was the first Bourne film I had seen then it would have been more exciting for me and I would have rated it more. Best to have put it to bed after the last one in my opinion. Left with a similar feeling after the last Spiderman film i.e. Ive just paid good money to see the say film again but with different actors..... If youre going to see this film with high expectations that its going to offer something fresh then you will leave with the feeling that youve purchased a knocked down sandwich from the supermarket at the end of the day looks ok but not so tasty when you come to eat it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 9 2012NancyFeaturedI really like Bourne Legacy because Jeremy Renner is in it and Im really big of Matt Damon hes o.k.

Universal The tagline for the new Bourne movie is ""There Was Never Just One"" which I fear could serve as a motto for nearly every summer blockbuster of the past 35 years. If this latest installment The Bourne Legacy is successful we will no doubt eventually be treated to The Bourne Inheritance The Bourne Perpetual Endowment and perhaps the bucolic-demonic crossover Children of the Bourne. Written and directed by Tony Gilroy The Bourne Legacy opens with a tease A man floats briefly in chilly waters before commencing to swim. Is this Matt Damons Jason Bourne? That is after all exactly where we left him at the conclusion of the last chapter in the franchise The Bourne Ultimatum. But no its not Damon and its not Bourne. The most interesting question arising from Legacy is just how long the filmmakers hope to trade on the Bourne name without any you know Bourne. Gilroys movie is a slightly odd duck neither precisely sequel nor reboot. Bourne is absent save for a few references and a drivers license photo. And the other recurring characters in the franchise--played by Joan Allen David Strathairn Scott Glenn and Albert Finney--are afforded only small cameos. Instead Gilroy who wrote all three previous Bourne screenplays has expanded his Ludlumverse shifting focus to a still-deeper ring of government plotters and their still-deeper plots. The first act of the new film takes place concurrently with many of the events of the last the assassination of a journalist in Londons Waterloo Station; Bournes return to New York; the gradual unraveling of the CIAs clandestine Treadstone and Blackbriar operations. But behind those operations lie others and at their center sits USAF Colonel (ret.) Eric Byer (Edward Norton) a bureaucrat of lethal competence at a black-budget agency so powerful that it goes by the narcolepsy-inducing name the National Research Assay Group. As Byer notes ""Treadstone was only the tip of the iceberg."" But the operations exposure threatens to reveal the entire iceberg so Byer sets about sinking it so deep that it will never be found.This is not good news for field agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) who is a part of that iceberg. Cross is a subject in an ultra-secret program called Outcome which aims to chemically increase physical and cognitive capabilities. As the movie begins he is training in the wilds of Alaska dodging wolves and leaping chasms. (Hes the one we saw swimming in the opening scene.) Its there that he receives the message delivered by Predator drone that his services will no longer be required. Given that his training and enhancements leave him ill-suited for most alternative careers he declines the offer of early retirement and returns to the lower 48 in search of--Id begun to type the word ""answers"" because thats what the hero in a Bourne picture is always in search of. But unlike his predecessor Cross has suffered no memory loss and what he is seeking is rather more mundane a steady supply of the green and blue pills that keep him respectively at his physical and cognitive best. (He has as we will learn his reasons.)To this end he finds himself entangled with Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) a virologist who works for SterisynMorlanta a military-contracted corporation that performs medical checkups on the agents in Crosss program. Shearing has just suffered a near-miss of her own as one of her co-workers--could there be a connection?--pulled a handgun at work and shot everyone else on her research team. (Its a scene that plays far more chillingly this week than the filmmakers could have envisioned.)From this elaborate setup the film bounces across continents and counties from Chicago to Seoul to Karachi to Manila from the leafy Maryland suburbs of D.C. to the leafy Virginia ones. Gilroys premise is a little goofy--physical and cognitive enhancements? really?--but his script (co-written by younger brother Dan) is sharp liberally sprinkled with knowing jargon and dark wit. Moreover Gilroy (with the help of his editor other younger brother John) does a good job of keeping his balls in the air alternating nimbly between on-the-ground action (Cross and Shearing running for their lives) and behind-the-scenes intrigue (Byer and his minions pulling strings in the situation room). MORE ON FILM Like Politics Political Movies Never Change Philip K. Dicks Messy Mindbending Cinematic Legacy How Aurora Changed The Dark Knight Rises In Movies with Nudity Whats the Line Between Ogling and Art? A Totally Forgettable Total Recall At least that is until the films final act when the movie falls out of balance with an action sequence that makes the mistake of substituting length for originality. The scene in question evokes first the Tunis rooftops-and-alleys pursuit of the last Bourne movie then the Saigon-on-the-back-of-a-motorcycle chase of Tomorrow Never Dies and finally (alas) the implacable onslaught of the T-1000 in Terminator 2. Despite this disappointing conclusion the new cast to whom the franchise has been bequeathed is uniformly strong. Renner proves himself a solid understudy for Damon even if the character he plays is rather less interesting. Norton follows up his excellent performance in Moonrise Kingdom with another equally good as the spymaster Byers. Weisz brings a sensitive intelligence to the role of Dr. Shearer. And Stacy Keach is a pleasant surprise as Byerss scarred Mephistophelian boss. Perhaps the most interesting question arising from The Bourne Legacy is just how long the filmmakers hope to trade on the Bourne name without any you know Bourne. And while Id like to say otherwise history suggests that the answer may be ""as long as they like."" After all five Thin Man movies were produced following the departure of the titular character (who was not Nick Charles but his original suspect) and the Pink Panther diamond has appeared in barely half of the movies that bear its name.Whatever the future of its franchise The Bourne Legacy is an eminently enjoyable entertainment--a largely successful if occasionally labored effort to breathe new life into a storyline that seemed to have run its course. Is it enough to erase memories of Jason Bourne? Of course not. But its enough to while away a few lazy summer hours.

But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia.

Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post A jarring scene of workplace violence threatens to throw the more popcorn-movie rhythms of ""The Bourne Legacy"" completely out of whack. No doubt the pistol-wielding sequence in writer-director Tony Gilroys riveting addition to the ""Bourne"" franchise was made more wrenching because the preview took place a week after the theater massacre in Aurora. It also serves as a reminder that the ""Bourne"" films have always wielded brutality with a sense that theres something at stake. This is a heft the franchise shares with the even darker Batman films of Christopher Nolan. (Although each franchises PG-13 rating means they are mostly blood-splatter-free.) Still the aforementioned carnage isnt fueled by race rancor or brain-chemistry madness. Although its made to look like the latter. Instead it is the sign of a governmental paranoia at work. At the end of 2007s ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" Jason Bourne went into the belly of the beast that robbed him of his memory and remade him. That third installment was Matt Damons final as the existentially troubled agent. And while the door has been left ajar for Jason to return the franchise has found a compelling new hero in Aaron Cross and a commanding performer in Jeremy Renner. Its possible Cross a former U.S. soldier presumed dead has an even more daunting skill set than Jason Bourne. Consider him and the new movie Bourne 2.0. Written by Gilroy and his brother Dan ""The Bourne Legacy"" rides on the entirely credible notion that Bourne was not the only agent the government was tweaking with drugs and training and biochemical meddling. He turns out to be the tip of the spear. There are other research programs besides Treadstone and agencies beyond the CIA involved in the behavioral and physical engineering of machine-efficient operatives. Dont let the movies many governmental acronyms and the medical jargon throw you -- the point is a simple one Bournes final incursion into New York made the governments clandestine work vulnerable. Whats ""morally indefensible but absolutely necessary"" as one defender for the programs says needs to be liquidated. Edward Norton puts a cool face on bureaucratically lethal decision-making as retired Col. Eric Byer the man who founded and kept the various projects running and now is yanking the plug. No agents. No medical researchers. No scientists. No exceptions. Rachel Weisz portrays Dr. Martha Shearing a medical researcher who was happily engrossed in her brainy work as a researcher without considering the bigger picture. Once she becomes the lone survivor of a rampage she no longer has that amoral luxury. Renner and Weisz work well together as two hunted souls who initially need each other for utilitarian reasons. Although she doesnt get it at first she requires his protection. He needs the drugs that keep Outcome agents physically and mentally whetted. Their slow simmer into something romantic may feel familiar but its also appealing. We root for them even when theyre participants in a beautifully absurd boldly choreographed motorcycle chase in Manila capital of the Philippines. A writer on the franchise at its start Gilroy is a trustee of the franchise intelligence. Hes also a deft and confident purveyor of genre action. You ask How confident? ""The Bourne Legacy"" doesnt plunge headlong into action but instead takes its time to introduce its newest hero a solitary figure in a frosty wilderness about to come in from the cold.

"The Bourne Legacy review Thrill killer | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Bourne Legacy review Thrill killerThe new faces are fine; its the old hand thats the problem in The Bourne Legacy.A Manila-set motorcycle chase late in the proceedings nearly saves The Bourne Legacy from inertia.  (Mary Cybulski / Universal Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 9 2012The Bourne Legacy (out of 4)Starring Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton. Directed by Tony Gilroy. 125 minutes. Opens Aug. 10 at major theatres. 14AWonder of wonders identity isnt the issue in The Bourne Legacy even with Jeremy Renner replacing Matt Damon as the forgetful spy guy.Renner is rugged and restless fighting personal demons as well as ones employed by Uncle Sam. Rachel Weisz makes a terrific new sidekick as a scientist turned accidental action woman. And Edward Norton gives good weasel as a ruthless CIA boss out to rub out the entire zombie assassin gang.Article Continued BelowThe new faces are fine; its the old hand thats the problem in this feeble fourth Bourne chapter. Series screenwriter Tony Gilroy supplants Paul Greengrass as director and the loss of momentum is palpable.Gilroys a fine writer -- he also penned Michael Clayton -- but without the discipline of an action veteran like Greengrass to rein him in he indulges his weakness to over-explain things. Gilroy and his co-writing brother Dan are too much into jabbering and jargon and not enough into action. Most of the first two-thirds of this overlong film is caught up in a weird chemical subplot Renners Aaron Cross a renegade from the black ops Treadstone spin-off Operation Outcome needs designer drugs to do his antihero stuff. If he takes the blue and green pills which act like Red Bull times a thousand (stop me if this gets too technical) hes a brainy killing machine. Stop taking them and hes just another dull drone working for the weekend.His supply is running low so Cross conscripts (make that kidnaps) viral scientist Dr. Marta Shearing (Weisz) to help him cook up a new batch -- or maybe even find a way for him to ""viral out"" from the addiction. Shades of Charly The Manchurian Candidate and even Blade Runner but what a letdown conceptually. Instead of being a well-intended patriot with unexpected abilities as old-school spook Jason Bourne was (hes described as ""first gen and non-meds"") Renners Cross is little more than the worlds most dangerous junkie. And he badly needs a fix. Cross and Shearing must get to the top-secret government lab that makes his stash and that could be almost anywhere in the world that the film plods -- from Alaska to the Philippines with many stops in the U.S. and U.K. along the way. They should have called the film The Bourne Laboratory.Out to stop them along with other ""black ops"" government hitmen (Bourne wasnt the only one as the ads scream) is Nortons CIA manager Eric Byer who comes by his brutal renewal philosophy by way of Heart of Darkness or maybe Harry Potter. Byer calls his black ops stooges ""sin eaters"" because they do dirty deeds that dont come dirt cheap ""We are morally indefensible and absolutely necessary."" But lately many of them have become sloppy embarrassing and decidedly less than necessary hence the pink slips to be issued by machine guns and cover-ups.""Show dont tell"" is the mantra of any good action filmmaker or should be but Gilroy doesnt get it. If you havent looked at your watch by the time Weisz launches into her long mid-film description of how the drugs work you surely will then. The sole tedium breaker is a scene where Cross doing the Iron John thing in the Alaskan wilderness outwits a lethal drone missile with the help of a hapless wolf apparently a relation of Wile E. Coyote. Jason Bourne appears only in photos and conversations as the plot clumsily links to The Bourne Ultimatum the third film in the series. A bigger boo-boo is the host of talent -- Albert Finney Scott Glenn David Strathairn Joan Allen -- who zip across the screen with unseemly haste. This isnt the kind of action Im talking about Tony.The picture is almost saved by the third act when a motorcycle chase in the crowded streets of Manila almost makes it seem that another director is at the helm. The late introduction of a new villain called Larx -- who should be known as Lurch -- isnt actually smooth but it is fun to watch.This kind of propulsion is the legacy the Bourne franchise needs to follow if the sequels and spin-offs are going to continue as the story strongly hints they will.But if talking and explaining is the primary objective youd be better off just staying home and reading a book. And may I suggest one by Robert Ludlum the late author of The Bourne Identity The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum?

"Fourth time around Bourne doesnt manage much of a Legacy |       NJ.com comments Fourth time around Bourne doesnt manage much of a Legacy Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 10 2012 at 900 AM View/Post Comments Mary CybulskiJeremy Renner stars in ""The Bourne Legacy."" ""Bourne."" Again. Three and youre out is the new Hollywood maxim. So after a trilogy of Robert Ludlum films pumped up the American spy genre mostly thanks to Matt Damon (and some migraine-inducing editing) its time for the inevitable reboot. Bring on ""The Bourne Legacy."" Well maybe not. The films definitely made for dedicated fans. In fact new director Tony Gilroy -- who wrote the three previous entries in the series -- has said ""everyone who got into them will be rewarded for paying attention"" with this one which melds new characters with old plot lines. But what if you only saw the first episode or the second? What if all that Cuisinart editing made you zone out a bit and you have a bit of a problem recalling the details? Well then youre also a bit out of luck as the movie starts without so much as a debriefing cutting back and forth between three story lines and throwing around a lot of tech talk and code names such as ""Treadstone"" ""Blackbriar"" and ""Outcome."" Most of this dialogue falls to spymaster Edward Norton who delivers it with caffeinated conviction -- but then disappears about 90 minutes into the film. Which is okay because ultimately once we get all this exposition out of the way we realize little of it was really necessary. The real plot -- which finally emerges after a lot of throat-clearing -- is simply that the governments super-secret super-human spy program is being shut down because of a security breach. Shut down so completely that all the bioengineered spies in it are being assassinated. One of them though is a little reluctant to go. Apart from taking too long to get started the script is far-fetched even for a spy series. Why kill your own agents even if their cover has been blown? You cant fake their deaths? Give them new identities? This kind of conspiratorial plotting is simply cheap. And once the plot is moving -- well any turns it takes are strictly geographic. Jeremy Renner the spy who wants to live starts running towing along one of the pretty scientists who engineered his superb performance skills. The bad guys of course give chase. And theres 90 straight minutes of heart-pounding running improbable hand-to-hand combat and scenery-shredding gunplay. Theres something slightly mysterious about Renner and that gives his barely sketched out character some depth. Similarly Rachel Weisz who plays the scientist has always conveyed spunky intelligence; Norton a prickly impatience. But there are no real characters here no revelations and far too many scenes of men in white shirts and dark ties looking at computer screens or squabbling in tiny rooms snapping out a lot of acronyms that advance the story not one bit. The whole thing ends with a motorcycle chase in Manila. It is to be fair a rather spectacular chase and one thats likely to go down on some movie nerds list of Most Awesome Chase Scenes Ever. But once its over the movie basically ends. The director has nothing left to say. Because this isnt and never was a real story. It was a maze on a place mat -- Can You Help the Spy Get Home? Its twists and turns and nothing else. And fast and furious as it may be if this is the best this once-smart series has to offer this is no legacy. Its the beginning of an epitaph.

"Bourne Legacy The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bourne-legacy-the ) Bourne Legacy The (United States 2012) August 10 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The total worldwide box office gross for the first three Jason Bourne movies (The Bourne Identity The Bourne Supremacy The Bourne Ultimatum) is nearly one billion dollars (more if adjusted for inflation). With that kind of money in play was there any chance that Universal Pictures would not bankroll a fourth Bourne movie? Even when neither director Paul Greengrass nor star Matt Damon showed much interest? (In fact Greengrass once jokingly referred to a fourth movie as The Bourne Redundancy.) Changing leads is nothing new in cinema. It has been done most successfully with the James Bond franchise but there are plenty of other examples. Perhaps that should have been the template used here. However instead of having Jeremy Renner step into the role of Jason Bourne the filmmakers have given him another character in the same universe. The problem is viewers are invested in Bourne and not seeing him in a movie that bears his name feels like a cheat. Hearing him mentioned every ten minutes and never seeing him (except in still photographs) is a recipe for disappointed expectations. To really work The Bourne Legacy either needed to turn the title character into a 007-type who can change his face or bring back Damon in some capacity even if just for a cameo. Neither happens and that works to the movies detriment. The Bourne Legacy is one of Alfred Hitchcocks ""refrigerator movies"" in that it succeeds pretty well ""in the moment"" but starts to fall apart when considered in retrospect. Its not hard to become caught up in the action as its going on but the story does a lot of straining at times threatening to rip at the seams. At least those who despaired of Paul Greengrass shaky-cam style (a major drawback of The Bourne Ultimatum) can be comforted to know that Tony Gilroy possesses a tripod and knows how to use it. For Jeremy Renner taking over the franchise (at least for one installment) is a thankless duty. It remains to be seen whether hell be Bournes answer to George Lazenby or Roger Moore. Will Damon be back for the fifth Bourne? Will Renner return? Will they be teamed up? Time and money will provide the answers. For now Renner is the lead man and he is better than adequate in the part. His character is a cross between the one he played in The Hurt Locker and his introduction to another action/thriller series Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol. Renner has the chops for the part but I harbor qualms about where the script chooses to take the character. He is teamed with Rachel Weisz and the match works almost as well as the one between Damon and Franka Potente in The Bourne Identity. In fact that pairing may have been used as the basis for this one. Weisz gives a strong performance and easily ascends to a higher level than the standard type of ""female love interest/sidekick."" The Bourne Legacy provides more of the same rogue super-agent is pursued by government types who need to eliminate him to cover up their misdeeds and secrets. The recipe worked well enough in the three previous outings; why not repeat it here? Renner plays Aaron Cross an agent of The Program whos in Alaska on a training exercise when Bournes shit storm from The Bourne Ultimatum hits the fan. In deep CYA mode two of the key overseers of The Program Admiral Mark Turso (Stacy Keach) and Colonel Eric Byer (Edward Norton) decide burn it to the ground killing all the agents and the scientists who worked on it. Cross escapes instant death through a combination of sharp shooting and misdirection. Then when everyone believes him to have been eliminated he returns to the Lower 48. He needs a refill on his meds and he cant get it at the local CVS. The blue pill/green pill combo he takes daily gives him abnormal strength agility intelligence and pain resistance - but hes out. Unfortunately the scientists who have developed the medicine have been targeted for extermination. The only survivor of a workplace massacre Dr. Marta Shearing (Weisz) has a short life expectancy. At 135 minutes The Bourne Legacy seems about twice as long as it needs to be. There are really only three major action sequences (one in Alaska one on the East Coast of the United States and one in Manila). On none of these occasions is the inventiveness and energy evident in the fourth Mission Impossible movie to be found. The long final action set piece which lasts about 15 minutes and criss-crosses the traffic-clogged streets of the Philippine capitol exceeds the recommended time limit. Gilroy fails to keep the tension level high for the duration and there are instances in which it becomes repetitive. Its essentially one long chase that begins on foot and ends on motorcycles but aside from the location it falls into the generic category. The most suspenseful sequences are those that switch between Cross and Shearing as they attempt to stay ahead of their pursuers and Byer as he uses cutting-edge technology to locate them. The movie could have benefitted from more of these high-stakes/high-tech chess games. The surfeit of exposition which includes a long scene in which Shearing explains in excruciating detail to Cross what the medication does to him occasionally threatens to drag the proceedings to a halt. The Bourne Legacy proves unable to stand on its own. The Damon trilogy is required viewing to understand the context; some of what transpires will be confusing for those not familiar with terms such as ""Treadstone"" and ""Blackbriar."" Actors who had major roles in the earlier movies return for cameos. Poor Paddy Considine is especially ill-treated getting even ruder treatment than Franka Potente did in The Bourne Supremacy. And although The Bourne Legacy can boast an ending of sorts the final scene (and to an extent the entire movie) exists as a set-up for Bourne 5. Maybe this production will look better when viewed from a distance of 10 or 20 years but at the moment it appears like an overlong bridge to nowhere.

Plus A contest to name the next sequel. By Dana Stevens Jeremy Renner in The Bourne Legacy Mary Cybulski/Universal Studios. After you see the movie click on the player below to listen to Slates Spoiler Special on The Bourne Legacy Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I admit I was probably too excited for The Bourne Legacy. The three previous Bourne films--the first directed by Doug Limon and the second two by Paul Greengrass all starring Matt Damon as an amnesiac super spy--were a cut above other movies of this type with imaginatively staged action sequences and a sense of ambient melancholy that was almost European. That je ne sais quoi came in large part from the series head writer Tony Gilroy the sharp-eyed writer/director of Michael Clayton and Duplicity who with this new installment comes on as Bourne director (from a screenplay co-written with his brother Dan). In addition to Gilroys presence at the helm The Bourne Legacy boasted the intriguing casting of Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross a new dark-ops agent (he figures nowhere in the Robert Ludlum book series that inspired the trilogy) in place of the now-MIA Jason Bourne. Renners an actor Ive had my eye on since the low-budget indie biopic Dahmer (2002) in which he played the flesh-eating serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer not as a cool Hannibal Lecter archvillain but as an unspeakably damaged desperately needy young man. Renner didnt get another really substantial role until 2009 when he gave one of the years most powerful performances as an outwardly macho inwardly empty bomb-defusing specialist in Kathryn Bigelows Oscar-winning Iraq-war drama The Hurt Locker. Since then hes appeared mainly in frustratingly secondary or even tertiary parts (Ben Afflecks self-destructive childhood buddy in The Town a brainwashed master archer in The Avengers.) At 41 Renner is a late-blooming action star in a way I find pleasing; though hes built up his compact body to the required degree of gym-bunny buffness what makes his Aaron Cross a formidable opponent is what seems to be going on in the actors head. Advertisement Unlike the existentially confused Bourne Cross is perfectly clear on his original identity as we learn in a series of temporally disorienting flashbacks. Until he signed up for the ominous-sounding Outcome program in order to become a chemically augmented super-soldier Cross was Kenneth Kitson a soldier with an IQ so low his recruiting officer had to round it up by 12 points to allow him to serve. After news about the better-spying-through-chemistry Outcome program leaks to the press the top brass (led by Edward Norton and Stacy Keach as a pair of testy retired military officers) decide to shut the program down and stealthily pick off all the remaining participants. But Cross--who was off on an isolated training exercise in Alaska when the kill operation kicked in--manages to elude his pursuers just long enough to make it stateside There he half-rescues half-kidnaps Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) a scientist who helped create the meds Cross needs to maintain his mitochondrially enhanced edge and thus stay alive. She needs him to escape the government assassins now hot on their tails and he needs her to lead him to the stash of remaining meds which as it turns out is located in the Philippines. Hastily yet impeccably forged passport anyone? Up until Cross and Shearing land in Manila Legacy shows signs of being a worthy successor even a fresh addition to the previous Bournes. I appreciated that Gilroy went out of his way to write a hero very different from the one Damon played Where Jason Bourne was emotionally walled off to the point of near-catatonia Cross is a more open irreverent type who yearns for a chemically enhanced buddy to talk shop with. Some of the films best scenes take place early on as he joshingly tries to break down the defenses of a fellow Outcome agent. Later a tense shootout in a government lab makes good use of a sound effect too seldom heard in action movies silence. And the choice to make Cross traveling companion and potential love interest someone who was actively involved with the queasily eugenic science that created him added what could have been a morally complicating twist. But the movies last hour or so squanders these rich narrative possibilities in an incoherently plotted generically action-packed anticlimax. Without spoiling anything Ill just say that the final motorcycle chase in which a hastily introduced super-assassin character weaves through Manila traffic in seemingly endless pursuit of our hero and heroine could have taken place in any middling summer action movie while the closing scene--intended as a tantalizing cliffhanger for the sequel--left the story feeling simply unfinished. Thanks to Renners smart charismatic performance and a couple of elegant action sequences early on The Bourne Legacy mostly holds its own as a late-summer thrill ride--but only if youre able to wipe your mind clean of the knowledge that it could have been something more.  This years Slate Summer Movies contest takes its inspiration from the long tradition of formulaic-yet-awesome Robert Ludlum titles. Most of the spy novels by this bestselling author (and by the Ludlum knockoffs whove picked up the series baton since the authors death in 2001) have obeyed the titling formula of definite article + proper name + abstract noun a word combination that results in titles that sound at once urgently espionage-y and curiously vague The Aquitaine Progression The Holcroft Covenant The Prometheus Deception The Arctic Event. We know that the next Bourne film due in 2013 and set to co-star Denzel Washington will drop the connection to Jason Bournes character and return to an original Ludlum title The Matarese Circle. But I propose you pitch me your own future Ludlum-style movie title complete with poster tagline. What perils might befall the hero of The Weintraub Involvement? The Ottawa Uncertainty? The Betelgeuse Motivation? Send entries to slatemoviesgmail.com by midnight Eastern Time on Monday Aug. 13 and Ill compile some of the best entries for a future column with an item of Slate-branded swag (there has to be some around here somewhere) for the winner.

BOTTOM LINE Renner replaces Matt Damon but fires blanks in this draggy talky no-thrills ""Bourne"" imitation. CAST Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz Edward Norton If youre a fan of the ""Bourne"" movies -- and who isnt? -- youve probably been skeptical about the newest entry ""The Bourne Legacy."" For starters it doesnt star Matt Damon as covert superagent Jason Bourne a worrisome sign to say the least. Also missing is director Paul Greengrass who twice turned these hokey spy flicks into top-flight entertainment. While were at it the book that inspired ""The Bourne Legacy"" wasnt even written by the series original author Robert Ludlum. It turns out ""The Bourne Legacy"" isnt about Bourne or even his secret Treadstone group but another agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) from another program called Outcome. In an attempt at brand continuity faces from previous movies show up -- Scott Glenn as CIA director Ezra Kramer Joan Allen as whistle-blower Pamela Landy -- but the plot is driven by a new ruthless bureaucrat Lt. Col. Eric Byer (an effective Edward Norton). Same story different names. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? You might almost buy the bait-and-switch if Renner revealed even a glimmer of Damons intensity and vulnerability. Hollywood seems determined to turn Renner into an action hero (""Marvels The Avengers"" the latest ""Mission Impossible"") but here hes once again a sullen grim-faced figure whos too busy looking the part to show any emotion or a sense of humor. Cross budding romance with scientist Marta Shearing (an ill-used Rachel Weisz) doesnt play Its unclear why shed fall for this self-serious drip even if he did save her life. Director Tony Gilroy who so deftly transformed corporate wonkery into white-knuckle tension in ""Michael Clayton"" here does the exact opposite. This is a talky draggy thriller muddled by flashbacks and woefully low on action. Theres a zippy motorcycle chase through Manila near the movies end but by then this ""Bourne"" has wasted too much breath explaining how it connects to the others. My advice Accept no substitutes.

Bourne Legacy Success needed MoviesOur critics top 20 favorite movies In a summer in which Universals ""Battleship"" will lose about 100 million and its ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" will struggle to break even the studio badly needs its 130-million ""Bourne Legacy"" to connect. ""Its one of our most lucrative franchises"" Donna Langley Universals co-chairwoman said of the three ""Bourne"" films which have sold a combined 944 million in worldwide tickets. Unlike many successful series the cerebral spy tales filled with double and triple crossings have attracted strong reviews and robust attendance from older moviegoers who typically shy away from most big-budget summer fare. The studio wants the new film to succeed not only as a stand-alone production but also as the first entry in a potential cycle of movies. But Universal has struggled to create a separate identity for ""The Bourne Legacy"" which focuses on a clandestine program to create superhuman soldiers. Star Jeremy Renner says some of his friends still mistakenly believe hes playing Matt Damons character. ""I hope it starts a conversation -- that theres excitement about the possibilities"" Renner said about ""The Bourne Legacy.""

STEPHEN COLE Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 10 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 10 2012 151PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Tony Gilroy Written by Tony Gilroy Dan Gilroy Starring Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz Edward Norton Albert Finney Joan Allen Classification 14A Country USA Language English There is no Bourne in The Bourne Legacy. Matt Damons Jason Bourne has disappeared perhaps forever. And that takes getting used to. One of the kicks to the Bourne trilogy was watching its All-American hero wake from amnesia to discover he is a practised killer.Remember in The Bourne Identity how the boy next door summoned Eagle Scout improvisation tactics using a 99-cent pen to foil a machine-gun-wielding assassin? Watch The Bourne Legacy official trailer Jeremy Renner in The Bourne Legacy. Image for CP video. CP Film Video Bourne Legacy highlights new films this week Filmmaker Tony Gilroy who provided scripts for Bournes Identity Supremacy and Ultimatum not to mention writing and directing Michael Clayton is a master of murky political noirs. But this time out hes in expose mode. Most of the dark shadows and nervous hand-held camera work from previous Bournes are like former star Damon gone.The Bourne Legacy opens midday in Albertas snow-bright Kananaskis Park with a Bourne double Aaron Cross enduring his series baptism swimming a frigid seven-degree glacial lake. (Gilroy says star Jeremy Renner made the December dip without understudy or complaint.)Bourne double? Aaron Cross? Put them together and yes you have Double Cross. Renners character is in the same leaky boat as Jason Bourne - a rogue field operative an asset gone bad who must be terminated by nervous secret-service sponsors this time led by Edward Norton and Stacy Keach doing a passable Dick Cheney impersonation.Cross traverses the Rockies dodges a drone missile and dupes a wolf pack (in a sequence that out-Jack Londons anything in The Grey) before tracking down a dope-dispensing scientist who has made Aaron what he is a superstar athlete-operative addicted to malevolent spycraft and performance-enhancing drugs.The scientist Dr. Marta Shearling is well played by a frazzled Rachel Weisz. And most everything about the first half of The Bourne Legacy proceeds with the acrobatic guile that characterized the Bourne trilogy last decades definitive thinking-mans action series.One of the latest Bournes hooks - the idea that secret-service field operatives are laboratory action heroes not far from Ridley Scotts Blade Runners - liberates the series making credible any and all superman heroics. At the same time these athletic feats are made more sinister as the film reveals what happens when Cross doesnt get his ""greens"" and ""blues"" and is reduced to a depleted sweating junkie. (Gilroy connects big-league sports and spying with drug jargon; pro athletes have been using amphetamines and calling them ""greenies"" for decades.)Alas not all of The Bourne Legacys chemistry works as well as Aaron Crosss coloured tablets. Stars Renner and Weisz lack the rapport that characterized Matt Damons furtive affairs with Julia Stiles and Franka Potente in previous Bournes. Damons shy affection for his captive running mates offered sweet pockets of nutritive calm in the otherwise fast-galloping action pictures.What with all the greens and blues coursing through his system Renner doesnt seem capable of normal red-blooded affection for a woman. There is an awkward formality in his dealings with Weisz. Theyre never more than doctor/patient. All of which is disappointing given how well screenwriter Gilroy orchestrated the odd-socks romance between Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan in Proof of Life.And so the films denouement which takes place in Manila is never as involving as we might hope. We care about Cross and Dr. Shearling but not what happens to ""them.""With that said Bourne fans will find much to enjoy about The Bourne Legacy even if they are forced to do without the title character.

Photo Universal/courtesy Everett / Ev THE BOURNE LEGACY from left Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz 2012. ((c)Universal/courtesy Everett / Ev) Beginning more or less where ""The Bourne Ultimatium"" left off ""The Bourne Legacy is interrupted from time to time for news bulletins about the search for Matt Damons rogue CIA agent Jason Bourne last seen jumping into the East River to escape his former handlers. Disappointingly Bourne never resurfaces in this less-than-satisfying series reboot. The film is more a talky convoluted action-starved two-hour subplot starring Jeremy Renner as another far less interesting special agent who goes on the run with Rachel Weisz for reasons that are never clearly explained. Paul Greengrass who took over the ""Bourne series from Doug Liman for the second and third installments staged chases and action with such visceral excitement that the implausiblities of the labyrinthine plots whizzed past. Tony Gilroy who contributed to the writing of all four ""Bourne films steps in as director (he previously did well with the drama ""Michael Clayton and the spy rom-com ""Duplicity) and disastrously reverses the talk-to-action ratio. Renner (""The Hurt Locker"") is a formidable actor but having him open with a half-hour of eyeball-glazing exposition -- even as the film fails to flesh out his underwritten character -- does no favors to him or the audience. Following Bournes defection the CIA decides to shut down a program thats created a race of super-agents using experimental drugs to enhance their mental and physical capabilities. Rather than simply issuing pink slips the agency literally eliminates these agents as well as the scientists servicing them. Youd think theyd do this in a less messy and highly publicized fashion than driving one of the scientists to massacre his colleagues in a laboratory but this does make for a fairly suspenseful sequence as Weiszs Dr. Marta Shearing manages to elude death. Renners Aaron Cross meanwhile has not only eluded missiles aimed at him during a training mission in Alaska (where he wrestles a very phony-looking computer-generated wolf) but manages to fake his own death; a less loquacious super-agent played by Oscar Isaac isnt so lucky. For reasons that go inadequately explained Aaron shows up at Shearings home just as a black-ops team is about to execute a terminal severance package. He fakes her death too and demands as repayment that she find a way to make his powers permanent. Edward Norton another formidable actor spends an awful lot of time glowering at video-surveillance screens since hes not entirely sure that Shearing has been disposed of properly. He also hisses a lot at his superior (played by Stacy Keach who looks as if he wants to punch out Norton). After what seems like three hours Aaron and the doctor sneak into a pharmaceutical lab in Manila to give Aaron his fix. Im not sure whether they are there because hardly anybody uses the Philippines for Hollywood action films these days or because they offer more lucrative tax abatements than say Louisiana or Michigan. This leads to a confusingly shot foot-and-motorcycle chase with a CIA assassin that goes on for so long I forgot exactly what the point of it was. ""The Bourne Legacy isnt helped by cameo appearances by ""The Bourne Ultimatum co-stars Joan Allen David Strathairn and Albert Finney all of whom remind us of the sequel with Damon were not seeing. The whole thing is sort of like watching George Lazenby playing James Bond in ""On Her Majestys Secret Service while knowing that the producers are desperately negotiating a deal with Sean Connery to return for the next film. Renner and the audience deserve better.

Starring Jeremy Renner Edward Norton Rachel Weisz Director Tony Gilroy Release Opened Aug 10 2012  Editorial Review A new hero but same thrillsBy Ann HornadayFriday August 10 2012""The Bourne Legacy"" looks bad on paper. The fourth installment of the hugely successful franchise starring Matt Damon as the memory-depleted assassin Jason Bourne does not star Damon doesnt even feature his character and does not arrive by way of director Paul Greengrass whose jagged shaky-camera visual technique became as identifiable a marker of the series as Damons appealingly vulnerable hero. But -- surprise surprise -- ""The Bourne Legacy"" looks surprisingly good on-screen precisely because its so good on paper. Written and directed by Tony Gilroy who penned all three Jason Bourne movies ""The Bourne Legacy"" achieves its first order of business with intelligence and imaginative dexterity building on the preexisting story expanding its human capital and geography and leaving plenty of white space for Jason to jump back in if Damon and Greengrass ever decide to return. And Gilroy has fulfilled the movies second requirement with similar success casting Jeremy Renner in a leading role that asks him to carry ""The Bourne Legacy"" while easily co-existing with the titular ghost that haunts the franchise. The only thing missing is that peripatetic camera -- which will be good news for viewers who needed Sea-Bands before watching the Greengrass oeuvre. Gilroy who made a smashing directorial debut with ""Michael Clayton"" and a twisty romantic caper with ""Duplicity"" hews unapologetically to the classical cinematic style with a minimum of self-conscious flourishes or attention-getting edits. ""The Bourne Legacy"" which he wrote with his brother Dan unfolds with disarming straightforwardness -- a distinct advantage for a story that requires that spectators lean in and pay attention rather than zone out and take it all in. Gilroys most brilliant stroke of insight with ""The Bourne Legacy"" was to set it within the reality of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" the most recent of the movies that ended if you recall with Our Man dangerously at large in Manhattan. ""The Bourne Legacy"" opens thousands of miles away in Alaska where another agent Aaron Cross (Renner) is finishing a grueling training regimen tramping over snowy wilderness taking mysterious green and blue pills and going mano-a-mano with a wolf that would have given Liam Neeson pause in ""The Grey."" How are Jason and Aaron related? Why are shadowy figures within the CIA U.S. military and private security contractors so worried about him? What does an attractive genetic scientist played by Rachel Weisz have to do with it? And finally can Renner look as cool leading an epic motorcycle chase through Manila as Damon did leading an epic car chase through Moscow in ""The Bourne Supremacy""? The answer is yes even if the motorbike sequence goes on far too long. The acrobatics that Renner engages in along the way -- like a nifty two-wheel slide down a stone banister -- are preceded by just a handful of suspend-all-disbelief moments including a similarly spectacular slide down a slot canyon in a back alley and an out-of-left-field rescue at a pivotal characters suburban home. But for the most part ""The Bourne Legacy"" takes place in an impressively recognizable world where science hands-free geopolitics and the modern security state intersect to create human warriors who behave like the human equivalent of drones (without those pesky sentient emotions). Its that world and its ruthless thought-leaders (here portrayed in terrific performances by Edward Norton Stacy Keach and Dennis Boutsikaris) that Aaron must navigate -- with his memory intact but driven by just as dramatic an inner need. At least thats clearly what Gilroy intended; unfortunately Aaron Crosss personal struggle isnt nearly as narratively propulsive as Jason Bournes amnesia. Still Renner makes for an intense highly watchable franchise-anchor-in-the-making his character a combination of high-I.Q. savant and MacGyver-like Mr. Fix-It who can whip up a clever anti-detection device with duct tape and an aluminum pie plate. Renners enormous appeal has always resided in his ability to project star power (witness his Oscar-nominated work in ""The Hurt Locker"") as well as un-showy everyman believability (witness his Oscar-nominated work in ""The Town""). Both work to his advantage here although it would be nice for those glints of spontaneous humor to get more play in succeeding productions. Whether there will be more productions depends on ""Bourne"" fans willingness to let go of Jason and throw down with Aaron at least for the time being. With ""The Bourne Legacy"" Gilroy has brought characteristic taste and skill to a nearly impossible task embracing the past without completely erasing it thereby creating an invitingly complicated and open-ended future. Contains violence and intense action sequences.

Starring Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton. Directed by Tony Gilroy. (PG-13. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Bourne series ended with the last installment and now comes a 135-minute death rattle called ""The Bourne Legacy."" Its a peculiar movie both over-plotted and under-plotted encumbered by layers of detail and yet with no details invested in or developed. And it all but squanders Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz although with actors less appealing ""The Bourne Legacy"" would be even worse. The film is almost opaque in its storytelling. As the film starts Renner is in a cold woodland area injecting himself with blood taking swims in freezing water and climbing mountains. We dont know why hes there and we never quite find out. Meanwhile Jason Bourne is in New York apparently creating a stir although we never see him. And theres a journalist in London who is about to expose Operation Treadstone or perhaps Blackbriar and no one ever explains what these are or what the difference is between them. The assumption is that the audience has just seen the entire Bourne trilogy this week and has committed each detail to memory. Oh and back at headquarters well theyre beside themselves because all this (whatever this is) means they just might have to call off Blackbriar - or is it Alcom? (I think thats how its spelled - in any case its top secret.) Edward Norton and Stacy Keach as intelligence officials have terse meaning-filled conversations in which they exchange lingo and talk in code and if most of it goes over your head fine its supposed to. Youre getting a privileged look at how the big boys do things. Anyway one thing is clear. One thing couldnt be more certain Whatever this is - and theres no telling what this is - its a direct threat to national security But wait theres more Theres a workplace massacre. What would an action movie be without one of those? A scientist working at a top-secret facility locks all his colleagues into the office and starts shooting them one by one. This is probably the last thing anyone wants to see dramatized after the events of the past few weeks. Tony Gilroy directed and co-wrote ""The Bourne Legacy"" and the films problems are similar to those of his previous film ""Duplicity."" He piles on excessive detail while providing no explanation and in the case of this film thats probably because were the answers offered they would seem banal. In any case what the movie is after and what Gilroy takes at least an hour to arrive at is a story that involves a young betrayed agent (Renner) and an attractive woman (Rachel Weisz) running for their lives just as in ""The Bourne Identity."" Once Weisz who plays a scientist and Renner team up the movie finally takes on a rooting interest but on the most primitive level Renner and Weisz are both engaging and so we would rather not see them get blown up shot or die in a traffic accident. But Gilroy doesnt expend even a scene on the two getting to know each other. Its not as though they develop a bond and then the world converges on them. Rather theyre thrown together by circumstance and never really have time to breathe. The film contains only one effective action sequence - it takes place in the scientists home. There are also some nice shots of Renner and Weisz in close-up that tell us how highly Gilroy regards these actors and reminds us that this was the writer-director who gave us that brilliant ending to ""Michael Clayton"" with its long shot of George Clooney in the back of a cab. But most of the rest of ""The Bourne Legacy"" especially the action scenes is calculated to impress but dead. Worst of all after frittering away the first hour the movie doesnt even resolve the story at the finish. Instead theres the indication that a sequel is hoped for - one that may very well go the way of ""The Last Airbender 2."" Meanwhile what are we to make of this recurring nightmare that we see in movie after movie in which the government is depicted as a bunch of jerks in suits looking at various screens and trying to figure out how to assassinate innocent people all over the world? Moreover what will the future make of this? Lets hope theyll just think that we were paranoid. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"The Bourne Legacy lives up to its predecessors Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview The Bourne Legacy lives up to its predecessorsThe Bourne Legacy starring Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton and directed by Tony Gilroy is an exemplary espionage thriller.August 09 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz star in ""The Bourne Legacy."" (Mary Cybulski Universal...)""There was never just one."" That advertising tag line for ""The Bourne Legacy""has an almost apologetic ring to it as if making a Bourne film without Matt Damon a the star of the first three and the epitome of the empathetic killing machine that is Jason Bourne a was a brash and risky move.As it turns out no one needed to worry because few films have less to apologize for than this one. Complex unexpected and dazzling alternating relentless tension with resonant emotional moments this is an exemplary espionage thriller that has a strong sense of what it wants to accomplish and how best to get there. And it is impeccably cast from stars Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton on down. Tony Gilroy the man responsible for this accomplishment is more than the director and co-writer of ""Legacy."" Though this is his first time behind the ""Bourne"" camera he has written on all four pictures and is in effect the keeper of the franchise flame. Gilroy knows the underpinnings of this world inside out and appreciates how essential it is to maintain and extend the house style of cool and credible intelligence that marked the previous films.VIDEO The Bourne Legacy trailerIt was Gilroy understanding that Damon was essentially irreplaceable who shrewdly decided to go in a different direction entirely ""Legacy"" expands the Bourne universe by positing that the secret U.S. government program that created Bournes chemically enhanced super warrior went wider and deeper than anyone suspected.""Legacy"" (co-written with Gilroys brother Dan) reveals that the Department of Defense had its own program code name Outcome with its own superior soldiers that paralleled the CIA Treadstone program that created Bourne.At the close of""The Bourne Ultimatum""Jason Bourne publicly exposes Treadstone. In ""Legacy"" we learn that Bournes move prompts government officials to abruptly shut down Outcome as well in order to limit possible exposure. But when these guys close down a program a whole lot more sinister than just putting a sign on the door is involved.PHOTOS Jeremy Renners career in picturesThis plotting may sound fairly straightforward but because were dealing with a Bourne film the way its presented is anything but. By thrusting us right in the middle of a fast-moving story the Gilroys have made ""Legacy"" formidably hard to follow at first filled with characters who show up without being introduced and talk as if the audience was as up to speed as they are.Adding to this complexity is the fact that ""Legacy"" not only takes place in a multitude of international cities it also simultaneously follows a trio of distinct plotlines a stories that initially stand alone before inevitably coming together. Having three superb actors capable of taking care of business in each of these threads is essential in keeping the audience involved until the narrative fog burns away.First among equals is Renner who plays Outcome agent Aaron Cross. The film opens with Cross at a snowy training site in the remote wilds of Alaska maneuvering in frigid waters (the actor did the stunt himself) holding off a pack of wolves and in general proving himself to be as at home in the frozen north as Sgt. Preston of the Yukon.VIDEO On the set in ManilaRenner doesnt have Damons everyman grace but as his Oscar nominations for""The Hurt Locker""and""The Town""demonstrate he is a formidable actor who brings his particular brand of relentless intensity to the role of a remorseless killing machine. And he adds just enough humanity especially in his worries about running out of the pills that keep him special to keep us involved.Also new to the Bourne cosmos (though the film tells us hes been there in the shadows all along) is retired Air Force Col. Eric Byer (Norton) director of the super-secret agency called NRAG that runs all these programs and the man who made the decision to end Outcome.As convincing and commanding as hes been in years Norton outdoes himself as the implacable Byer determined to burn the village to save it by terminating these agents with extreme prejudice. ""We are the sin eaters"" he says with terrifying conviction. ""What we do is morally indefensible and absolutely necessary.""Coming off of the very different""The Deep Blue Sea""Oscar winner Weisz (""The Constant Gardener"") adds an essential and always welcome emotional element to the mix (and brings out the best in Renner in the process) as Dr. Marta Shearing a biochemist employed by a branch of a major drug corporation.Dr. Shearings job is essentially to do pharmaceutical maintenance on the Outcome soldiers whom she refers to only by number. Cross is no more than No. 5 to her and though she barely knows him circumstances too breathtaking to reveal bring them together and relentlessly up the ante in terms of nonstop jeopardy and jolting surprise twists.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESJeremy Renner lists Holmby Hills house remodel at 24.95...February 2 2013Critics Choice The Bourne LegacyAugust 15 2012The Bourne Legacy A new super-spy nabs mixed reviewsAugust 10 2012The intricate birth of The Bourne LegacyAugust 3 2012From the looks of it Berlin can lure filmsApril 4 2004MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesBusinessNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-bourne-legacy-review-20120810,0,3228287.story",200,thebournelegacy14,thebournelegacy,latimes

But once the story takes off its viscerally engaging anchored by strong performances with Jeremy Renner as a capable heir apparent.The title may seem misleading since Bourne is only talked about here. Hes supposedly spotted in New York by the powers that be but not by the audience. The story which expands upon the clandestine world of trained killers is triggered by events from the previous films.STORY Renner is reborn in Bourne LegacyVIDEO Five questions for Jeremy RennerMORE Bourne cast discusses the continuing franchiseRenner plays Aaron Cross a slick super-spy and Iraq War vet. Though he doesnt have as much charisma or nuance as Damon did he projects a steely intensity juxtaposed with moments of vulnerability that make his character appealing.But we get only droplets of his back story. Director Tony Gilroy co-writer of the three previous Bourne films knows this universe -- created by novelist Robert Ludlum-- backward and forward and should have further fleshed out Cross character.Legacy spins off where Ultimatum left off. When last we saw Bourne he and Agent Pam Landy (Joan Allen) exposed the top-secret Treadstone government project.About the movieThe Bourne Legacy   out of fourStars Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz Ed Norton Stacy Keach Oscar Isaac Director Tony GilroyDistributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for violence and action sequences Running time 2 hours 5 minutes Opens Friday nationwideThe film kicks off amid a CIA frenzy. Nefarious top brass such as Col. Eric Byer (Ed Norton) seek to minimize further exposure of their dark plans by shutting down the elite spy programs formed to create assassins. The agents at risk this time are in a related Defense Department program called Operation Outcome and their numbers include Cross.He is being groomed as an enhanced spy daily ingesting ""chems"" that boost his intelligence endurance and resistance to pain. When we first see him hes alone in a remote corner of Alaska. Then the action switches back to Washington over to Asia and the Middle East and ping-pongs headily between shady high-level CIA bureaucrats and operatives around the world.The dense tale can be hard to follow for the first half-hour until a disturbing shooting takes place in a lab where Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) is a doctor assigned to monitor Outcome field agents.Single-handedly fending off drones sent to kill him as well as wolves Cross makes it from Alaska to Shearings home in Maryland in a desperate search for meds. Weisz is a smart addition to the Bourne-sphere. An actress who conveys an astute intellect she seems as convincing spouting medical jargon as she does pulling off action stunts.Though there definitely is suspense the movie suffers from moments of lethargy and lacks the explosive urgency of previous installments.This latest Bourne doesnt send adrenaline surging the way Ultimatum did but its still a tense well-acted thrill ride.

(Video Universal Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Aug. 9 2012 617 p.m. ET An anxious world confronts the question Can a Bourne-again movie succeed without Matt Damon as Jason Bourne without Bourne himself and without a Robert Ludlum book as the productions turn-by-turn guide? Yes it can. ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a solid success primarily though not entirely because of Jeremy Renner. Hes a star worthy of the term as Aaron Cross another haunted operative who like Jason Bourne is as much a victim of the governments dirty deeds as a covert super-agent. But the production is impressive too. The director Tony Gilroy who wrote the screenplay with his brother Dan Gilroy has taken reliable elements from the Ludlum canon--nothing revolutionary here--added humanity heated that up to genuine passion in the person of Rachel Weiszs government research scientist Marta Shearing and staged a global cat-and-mouse game with hurtling energy uncommon intelligence and admirable clarity. ENLARGE Jeremy Renner takes over the franchise in The Bourne Legacy. Universal Studios And with a resourceful solution to the problem of continuity. The beginning of the new film overlaps the end of the previous one. An unseen Jason Bourne is still at large in Manhattan and David Strathairns steely eyed crisis manager barks out once again ""People listen up we have an imminent threat."" What worries him is the prospect of all sorts of vile stuff going public--not only about Bourne but about other secret programs using genetically enhanced agents like Aaron Cross to do unspeakable things on behalf of their unsuspecting nation. Whats been worrying the studio that created the Bourne franchise is the imminent threat of a torrential revenue stream drying up. But such concerns are abated by the first few minutes of ""The Bourne Legacy"" dramatic scenes that track Aaron Crosss travails in the wilds of Alaska and theyre banished by what follows a succession of straight-ahead and thoroughly satisfying action sequences set at the intersection of black ops and big pharma. (Robert Elswit did the cinematography which for my taste is too much in everyones face but consistently brilliant all the same. John Gilroy Dans fraternal twin did the intricate editing.) Where Jason Bournes abiding concern was figuring out his true identity Aaron Cross is obsessed with scoring a new supply of the chemicals that hes dependent on thanks to his genetic makeover. Without much exaggeration the new plot can be seen as a junkies international quest for a fix interspersed with his handlers efforts to find him and terminate him in the process of shutting down the program that produced him. The smart part though is that were with him all the way because its not his fault that he can live or at least flourish only with the green and blue pills that sustain his various enhancements. One of the many smart parts of his relationship with Marta is her ambiguous role in having empowered him. She insists that she was in it only for the science--a claim with faint overtones of Nazis following orders. Shes also attracted to the ordinary mortal he might be once hes detoxified and his enemies stop chasing him. ""Why do you have to stay enhanced?"" she asks tenderly at one point. ""Why is it important to you?"" For a hero and heroine who never have the down time to make love theyre as compelling a couple as you could ask for. Ms. Weisz has never been more affecting or better still more vital; the script puts her at the center of some harrowing drama and in the bargain gives her a chance to scream a bloodcurdling scream. Mr. Renner takes over the screen and the franchise with unforced authority. As an actor hes tightly wound and interestingly inward with frequent flashes of warmth. As a star hes a quick-witted well-spoken strong man whose vulnerability hints at a tragic sense. During the climactic chase of ""The Bourne Legacy"" the bad guy is in the Ludlumesque lexicon of the enterprise a beta project with minimized empathy. Mr. Renners Aaron is an alpha project with minimized affect but plenty of empathy to prevail. After three decades of marriage Kay played by Meryl Streep persuades her husband Arnold played by Tommy Lee Jones to attend a week-long counseling session to spice up their relationship and reconnect with each other. (Video Sony Pictures) ENLARGE Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep in Hope Springs. Columbia Pictures Hope Springs A surprise that sneaks up and moves you ""Hope Springs"" has the courage of its awkwardness and this is said admiringly in the spirit of the film which is irony-free and unfashionably earnest. The framework is simple A husband and wife in late middle age their sexual and emotional connections essentially defunct plunge into a week of intensive marriage therapy. The most awkward--and for a while off-putting--section is the long preface in which Kay (Meryl Streep) must convince unwilling Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) to take the plunge. Hes such a curmudgeon--played by a gifted actor whos been phoning in curmudgeonly performances for much too long--that you wish shed just give up and walk out on him. But she perseveres and the movie perseveres with affecting sometimes startling candor and eventually delivers on its promise by confronting the dark fears and furtive hopes of a couple no longer young. The most unexpected aspect of the film is its emphasis on sex and physical intimacy. Kids dont want to think about their parents having sex and the movie business ever more focused on youth usually shrinks from the subject of sex in later life or falls back on discrete editing as if to say yes these quaint oldsters want to do it too but well spare you the details. This film obviously made for an older audience embraces the subject explicitly and sometimes hilariously or quite clumsily with equal emphasis on feelings and on helping its repressed inarticulate couple find the words to express what they feel. Thats the work of the therapist Dr. Feld whos played absolutely straight by Steve Carell. While pleasant jokes are made about him--Feld is a local celebrity in the small town of Great Hope Springs Maine--he serves his patients and the story with calm intelligence but none of the self-mocking humor thats become the actors trademark. The film directed by David Frankel from a script by Vanessa Taylor is being sold as a comedy which it is not though it gives its stars what they need to take their roles comically as well as seriously. Thats clear from the outset when Arnold rebuffs Kays anxious invitation with the announcement that he isnt feeling well because he had pork for lunch. At this point in her career Ms. Streep could enchant us by doing a vacuum-cleaner commercial but she captures us here in her very first scene when Kay surveys herself uneasily in a mirror while we savor the familiar features that time has changed and the beauty that shines undiminished. Mr. Jones has become an icon of scowlingly jowly dyspepsia so its good fun when Arnold reluctantly following Dr. Felds prescription for a first therapeutic step allows Kay to caress him. (""Does it feel good?"" she asks. ""Feels like youre petting the dog"" he replies.) If the whole film were played for laughs it would be heavy going given the broad-brush direction--every action has a visible reaction. Much of the script in fact is framed as teachable moments and once again thats said with admiration. At a time of epic crassness in the entertainment industry heres a movie that truly does want to teach the possibilities of change at whatever point in life and that expands its emotional vocabulary only at the pace of its patients who are slow but devoted learners. The expansion is matched by a growth in complexity; both Kay and Arnold come to learn that they arent the people they believed themselves or each other to be. Thats what therapy is supposed to do of course but its still moving to follow their crabwise progress and to watch two wonderful actors find flashes of beauty in unlikely moments. (This is less surprising for Ms. Streep than it is for Mr. Jones who brings Arnold to a pained spiritual nakedness.) ""You know how you think youre always headed toward things?"" Kay says recalling the lost optimism of her youth. ""Hope Springs"" heads the two of them toward hard-won wisdom in a journey well worth taking. Rival politicians Cam Brady played by Will Ferrell and Marty Huggins played by Zach Galifianakis battle for a congressional seat in North Carolina. (Video Warner Bros.) The Campaign If ever a campaign seasons idiocies and hollow pomposities needed to be punctured by sharp satire or held up to fearless ridicule this is that season but ""The Campaign"" isnt the movie to do it. Its premise is intriguing enough Two blithering idiots played by Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis run for a previously uncontested Congressional seat in North Carolina. And the filmmakers--director Jay Roach working from a screenplay by Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell--play with or at least toy with some potent ideas the fulsome thrum of empty rhetoric; the pervasive power of money the behind-the-scenes influence of a couple of brothers named Motch who might conceivably be taken for a couple of brothers named Koch. (My favorite idiocy is less political than intellectual; it has Mr. Ferrells candidate being coached as in a game of charades on the words of the Lords Prayer.) Instead of biting wit though the movie settles for sketch humor standard-brand raunch and toothless slapstick that trivializes everything it touches. By doing so it clarifies an essential difference these days between mainstream movies and cable TV. On HBO Mr. Roach directed a pair of provocative films with a lot to say about contemporary politics ""Game Change"" and ""Recount."" Here with a bigger budget to justify and a wider audience to please hes back in the safe mode of his Austin Powers comedies as well as ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Meet the Fockers."" His new movie does emphasize by inadvertance the daunting task of addressing our situation in comic terms. Maybe the surreal realities of the current campaign really are beyond satire ridicule parody or ready comprehension but this ultimately puerile gagfest has little reach and less grasp. ENLARGE DVD Focus ""The Town"" (2010) Jeremy Renner first achieved fame (and an Oscar nomination) for his role as the bomb squad sergeant in ""The Hurt Locker"" but he also gives an electrifying performance in this strong dramatic thriller directed by Ben Affleck. Working both sides of the camera Mr. Affleck plays a bank robber named Doug MacRay; Mr. Renner is James Coughlin Dougs lethally volatile partner in crime. The cast includes Rebecca Hall as a bank branch manager Jon Hamm as a remorseless FBI agent and in smaller roles Blake Lively and the late Pete Postlethwaite. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" (2006) David Frankel directed this popular film a cheerful morality play clothed in clothes. Its main distinction is Meryl Streeps portrait of a tyrannical fashion editor Miranda Priestly who can administer a lethal tongue-lashing while barely moving her tongue. Anne Hathaway is Andy Mirandas clueless young assistant. Ms. Hathaways fresh beauty makes Andys innocence convincing up to a point while her acting suggests darker motives. But she seems to have been directed to sell innocence and ambition as commodities or in the spirit of the film as brands. (Innocence Ambition Fresh) Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) Its comparing pebbles and mountains but Stanley Kubricks Cold War masterpiece reminds you what political and social satire can do at its peerless best. And what is that? Satire can as this film does render unfathomable folly fathomable by scaling it up to the dimensions of comic lunacy. The screenplay credited to Kubrick Terry Southern and Peter George provides a canvas like none other for the talents of George C. Scott Sterling Hayden Keenan Wynn Slim Pickens Peter Bull and in the roles of Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove Peter Sellers.

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint It starts as before with a motionless body -- dead? alive? -- underwater. This time the immobile figure is Aaron Cross a medically enhanced hunter/killer in the same U.S. black-ops program that spawned Jason Bourne. He emerges from an icy Alaska lake to participate in a hide-and-seek exercise testing his superhuman stamina and amped-up brainpower. In a white-knuckle sequence orchestrated to magnificent effect by cinematographer Robert Elswit Cross (Jeremy Renner) leaps chasms and outmaneuvers a predatory wolf pack. When he asks another agent whether its common for wolves to pursue human quarry the man replies ""They dont think youre human."" He is and he isnt. As with its chilly intelligent predecessors ""The Bourne Legacy"" follows a field agent whose physiology has been re-engineered as a perfect violence engine but whose emotions remain preoccupied with nagging moral issues of right and wrong. Cross known as No. 5 to his distant overseers is kept on a short leash. He carries only a few days supply of the ultra-amphetamines that provide his killer edge. When a security breach threatens to expose the clandestine program management terminates it with ruthless efficiency live assets and all. Cross whose participation in the program was mostly unwitting aims to shut down the shadowy spymasters before his prescriptions run out. The Bourne franchise lost valuable assets when Matt Damon and director Peter Greengrass withdrew from the series but this fourth installment proves their loss was merely a flesh wound. Jay Boller Universal Jeremy Renner stars in ""The Bourne Legacy."" Tony Gilroy the screenwriter for every installment steps confidently to the directors chair. Gilroy unravels this thriller in parallel time with Jason Bournes score-settling trip to New York City. Reports of his exploits filter in through the media while players from earlier chapters (Albert Finney David Straithairn Joan Allen) mingle with new CIA blackguards (principally Stacey Keach and Edward Norton who calls the program ""morally indefensible and absolutely necessary""). This time the audience surrogate/romantic interest is Rachel Weisz playing a genetic researcher who has no options but to go on the run with Renner. Now in charge of both the script and the camera Gilroy maintains cool control of the narrative ratcheting up the tension along the way toward startling bursts of excitement. He can turn a room full of D.C. bureaucrats and video monitors into a pressure cooker of anxiety rip up the screen with a chilling lone-shooter massacre or kick out the jams with a high-impact 8-minute motorcycle chase through traffic-choked Manila. ""The Bourne Legacy"" makes the most of its inheritance and sets the stage for a long rich genealogy to come. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

You Okay? Credit Universal Studios From The Bourne Legacy - Manila Chase Manila Chase Credit Universal Studios As the title of the fourth movie in a perhaps never-ending series The Bourne Legacy is almost too perfect. Variations on what happened to Jason Bourne in the first three entries can befall new characters indefinitely. If this prospect sounds a little tiresome -- well thats what quick cuts and superhuman stunts are for. The Bourne Legacy is also the title of a novel by Eric Van Lustbader who continued Bourne creator Robert Ludlums uh legacy. But the Bourne movies long ago diverged from those authors storyline and now theyve jettisoned the character as well. This installment centers on Aaron Cross played by The Hurt Lockers Jeremy Renner. Co-writer/director Tony Gilroy whos had a hand in writing the previous three films in the franchise cleverly overlaps the events of this chapter with those of The Bourne Ultimatum. Its because Jason Bourne has become uncontrollable that the powers that be -- led by Edward Nortons cold-blooded bureaucrat Eric Byer -- decide to shut down a different super-soldier program code name ""Outcome."" That of course means killing everybody in the operation and anybody who knows about it plus some innocent bystanders just to show how merciless American clandestine services are. The Bourne Legacy is fantasy of U.S. government ruthlessness worthy of the Tea Party Film Club. Unfortunately for Byer one Outcome operative declines to die Cross whos introduced doing the CIAs version of Outward Bound in Alaska. When not dodging missiles he tangles with what must be the same pack of wolves who menaced Liam Neeson in the ridiculous The Grey earlier this year. ""Wolves dont track people"" Cross correctly notes but he (and the movie) dont follow up on that insight. Hes too busy looking for his ""reds."" Yes Cross has been chemically altered and genetically enhanced. Outcome went beyond the previous programs Treadstone and Blackbriar which merely indulged in physical training and behavior modification. Now that Outcome has become plausibly deniable Cross fears hell lose the super-stuff fed to him by such medical researchers as Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz). This is one lab rat who doesnt want the experiment to stop. i Eric Byer (Edward Norton) is a bureaucrat who wants Cross dead after shutting down the government program that chemically altered and enhanced him. Mary Cybulski/Universal Studios hide caption toggle caption Mary Cybulski/Universal Studios Eric Byer (Edward Norton) is a bureaucrat who wants Cross dead after shutting down the government program that chemically altered and enhanced him. Mary Cybulski/Universal Studios The middle part of the movie is set in the D.C. area where Cross rescues Shearing from still more homicidal government agents. She tells him that he can still be an Ubermensch without his meds but hell have to get a shot of a substance thats way outside the Beltway. So the duo head to Manila one of those teeming Asian cities thats great for chase scenes. Its in the Philippines that Gilroy begins to emulate Paul Greengrass who directed the two previous Bourne films with frantic pans and jittery edits. Overall though The Bourne Legacy is more staid and less Dramamine-demanding than Greengrass episodes. Also in Asia is yet another superagent the product of yet another top-secret program. This guy is supposed to be Cross great nemesis but their showdown seems rushed. Even at more than two hours the movie doesnt really have time to develop the story of one more clandestine hyperwarrior operation. The new movie includes cameos by such Bourne veterans as Joan Allen Albert Finney Scott Glenn and David Strathairn. (But not Matt Damon who has publicly dissed Gilroy.) Yet this is basically the tale of a loner even if Cross eventually does acquire a helpmate/love interest/personal physician. Call it The Bourne Franchise Ghost Protocol -- a fever dream of amok individualism as much as stoic brutality.

This time out the ingredients are all there but the proportions are completely off-kilter. In the previous ""Bourne"" movies we could count on about 30 percent ""people in rooms with computer screens yelling into phones"" and 70 percent ""Matt Damon jumping off things and shooting people in the face."" This time out for unfathomable reasons its about 60/40 making for an oft-tedious glob of exposition thats only occasionally interspersed with breathtaking fights and chases. If nothing else ""The Bourne Legacy"" is an object lesson about what the phrase ""cut to the chase"" means. Director Tony Gilroy (who co-wrote this one with brother Dan Gilroy and who also has a screenplay credit on the three previous ""Bourne"" outings) assumes that the audience really really wants to know about the inner workings of the secret projects that developed not only Jason Bourne but also a whole crew of physically and mentally enhanced super spies. With Bourne having gone public in New York in ""Ultimatum"" all eyes are on the program while Col. Byer (Edward Norton) and his team go fully into damage-control mode. That means wiping out the surviving agents including one Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) as well as the doctors and scientists involved. As you might imagine Cross manages to slip through the net and his next move is to rescue Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) in the hopes that she can continue to supply him with the pills that keep him smarter and stronger and faster than the mere mortal he once was. The ultimate legacy of ""The Bourne Legacy"" is that a lot of very talented actors (including Donna Murphy Corey Stoll Stacy Keach and Zeljko Ivanek) will now be able to afford to do Ibsen in the Park next summer thanks to the fat Hollywood check they picked up for a movie that asks little of them but to point at screens and bark out some version of ""arglebargle-science-jargon-bring-him-in"" Renner meets the challenge of creating a character out of someone who has been specifically designed to be a blank slate by allowing this government-manufactured killing machine to have a soul and even a vulnerability or two. And while theres not much heavy lifting required of Weisz shes neither helpless girl nor Superwoman; her responses feel like the genuine emotions of an intelligent woman suddenly caught up in life-and-death circumstances beyond her control. When ""The Bourne Legacy"" finally does let the stunt team out to play the movie feels of a piece with its thrilling predecessors from Aarons face-off with a house full of would-be assailants to a stirring motorcycle chase through Manila. But when we cut back all too often to people at desks throwing files around and harrumphing over monitors the films pulse grows way too slack. Seeing a ""Bourne"" film for the plotting feels like reading Playboy for the articles but if thats your thing this is your movie. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 The Bourne Legacy begins fittingly with a nod to The Bourne Identity a guy floating in the water photographed from underneath. Hes like a fetus in amniotic fluid ready to pop. Video Trailer The Bourne Legacy More about The Bourne Legacy >> In the 2002 film of course the floater turned out to be Matt Damon fished from the Mediterranean with bullets in his back and no memory of who he was or what he was. He spent the next two hours and the next two movies - The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum - trying to put the puzzle of his life back together. In The Bourne Legacy its Jeremy Renner submerged in the H20. Out for a bracing swim in the Alaskan wilds he emerges bare-chested from the glacial pond and grabs a space blanket. Hes got a cave and a fire and a backpack with essential gear - primal man GPS-equipped. Renner is Aaron Cross who turns out to share Damons Jason Bourne pedigree deep-cover special ops fine-tuned and fiercely trained one of ""the most valuable intel assets in the field"" to quote some Tony Gilroy CIA-speak. Gilroy wrote the first three Bournes moved on to write and direct the brilliant Michael Clayton and coscripted and directs The Bourne Legacy a momentum-driven thriller that depends less on star power than on epic action sequences. It takes a while to realize that Renners secret agent is moving through the world (everywhere from Alaska to the Mid-Atlantic to Manila) about the same time that Bourne was running around in Ultimatum. And the same coterie of ex-military spooks and National Security brass are following him. Yes if you hunger for Scott Glenn and David Strathairn barking orders and checking the latest satellite feeds rest assured - theyre back And theyre joined by Edward Norton who has nothing but contempt for ""these CIA clowns"" who have messed up Operations Blackbriar and Treadstone and whatever this ""Outcome"" business is. Unlike Jason Bourne Aaron Cross has no difficulty with memory-retrieval issues. He has a few mountains to climb a meet-up in an isolated cabin (with Oscar Isaac as a fellow agent - the two circling each other warily) and then a missile-firing drone to deal with. Cross issue is medication His supply of little blue and green pills which he has come to rely on for the mental and physical acuity they provide is running out. Which leads him to a top-secret pharmaceutical lab in the Maryland suburbs and to Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) a biochemist who has conveniently ignored significant ethical questions for the sake of scientific discovery. Like Damon and Franka Potente in The Bourne Identity Renner and Weisz go on the lam in Legacy with just about the entire military-industrial complex hot on their trail. Its a demanding role for Weisz - not just the airport check-ins with phony passports the firefights and the hanging-on-for-dear-life motorcycle rides. Shes a complicated woman with her own unhappy backstory and a cavernous old Victorian tucked away in the woods to worry about too. Its at the Sterisyn-Morlanta facility where Marta works that The Bourne Legacy really takes off. Gilroy orchestrates an absolutely chilling lab shooting - a deranged doc on a killing spree - that sends Weiszs character flying out of there and soon Renner is alongside. Pulse-pounding and suspenseful the film accelerates from a fiery confrontation at Martas house to a masterfully staged shot and edited chase sequence that starts in a manufacturing plant in Manila and then literally covers the Philippine capital from one end to the other as Renner bounds across rooftops and roars around the streets in cars and on bikes trying to avoid the squad of killers out to get Cross and Shearing. I cant complain about The Bourne Legacy - its smart its exhilarating and Gilroys depiction of a high-tech world where our every move is captured by surveillance cams and Big Brother-types deploying the latest spyware feels authentic and troubling. (The idea of going off-grid gets more attractive by the minute.) Renner intense and focused has already proved his mettle in The Hurt Locker and Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol. Hes not a movie star - he doesnt have that weird innate charisma thing that his Bourne predecessor possesses and at times you may find yourself wishing he did. But Renner slips into the skin of Aaron Cross. Hes keenly cognizant of his place in the world of the danger he is in and confident in his abilities to survive. And thats what Legacy is ultimately about survival. Survival of the fittest of the fastest. And the likely survival of the Bourne franchise too.

The Bourne Legacy Credit Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures By Peter Travers August 9 2012 More News Travers Bourne Legacy Wrong Sans Damon All Stories >> When are solid action good actors and only a semiidiotic spy plot not good enough for summer-movie escapism? When they stand in a long shadow thats when. And The Bourne Legacy is dwarfed by the three smash Bourne movies (one from director Doug Liman two from Paul Greengrass) that preceded it. More News Travers Bourne Legacy Wrong Sans Damon All Stories >> The biggest miss is the absence of Matt Damon as amnesiac CIA agent Jason Bourne. Wait a minute. How can you have a Bourne movie without Bourne? Its called making sure a profitable series keeps laying golden box-office eggs. So director Tony Gilroy who participated in writing the other film adaptations of Robert Ludlums Bourne bestsellers came up with a new character. Hes Aaron Cross an operative who is genetically enhanced in mind and body as long as he takes a blue pill and a green pill at certain intervals. Hurt Locker Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner plays this series of tics as if it added up to an actual character. Good on him. But the plot strains to bursting as CIA suit Eric Byer (a snarling Edward Norton) conspires to eliminate Aaron and all traces of the program that produced him. That leaves Aaron at the mercy of Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz slumming gracefully) a genetic scientist who needs to get Aaron to the Philippines for more pills. Dont ask. Gilroy stages two riveting shootouts involving Marta at work and home. And theres a killer chase scene in Manila as the bad guys try to knock Aaron and Marta off their speeding motorcycle. Its all sound and fury signifying nothing except a desperate need to feed a franchise.

"Bourne Legacy cant revive the franchise without Matt Damon - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Bourne Legacy cant revive the franchise without Matt Damon Share Tweet Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 08.08.12 | 850 AM If youre going to make a ""Bourne"" movie without Matt Damon Jeremy Renner isnt a bad second choice. Hes runty but determined with some of the bantam confidence of Jimmy Cagney in his prime. And he gets things done more so in his character of Aaron Cross another on-the-run survivor of the CIAs top secret superspy program than as a newly minted star assigned the task of reviving a dormant movie franchise. The best thing that can be said about ""The Bourne Legacy"" is that Renner will survive it. Tony Gilroy who had a hand in writing the first three ""Bourne"" films climbs into the directors chair working from a script co-written with his brother Dan thats ""inspired"" by Robert Ludlums novels. ""Legacy"" starts off well steadily intercutting between the agency spooks panicking as their secrets are threatened with exposure and Cross all the way up in Alaska where hes on a sort of Outward Bound course for Ubermensches. The behavior modification of the Damon movies has branched out to viruses genetics and pharmaceuticals with the hero popping ""blues"" and ""greens"" to keep his power levels up. Says one character of Cross ""If he doesnt viral out hes gonna run out of brain."" Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Thats about as cogent as the dialogue gets. It helps to have seen the earlier Bourne movies--maybe within the past week--so you can follow the hectic datelines (""Reston VA 414 a.m."") military crypto-speak (""Solo fuel to Bingo is green"") and general alarm as head spook Col. Eric Beyer (Edward Norton) shuts down the project by having everyone killed. An early scene in which a colleague of lab scientist Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) goes on a shooting rampage is deeply harrowing but partly just due to recent headlines. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Gilroy has a knack for modish middleweight character study that served him well in his directorial debut 2007s ""Michael Clayton"" but he has a way to go as an action director. ""The Bourne Legacy"" moves all right but with a jittery visual sense that comes increasingly unglued. Another early sequence in Shearings house with her and Cross fighting off a team of heavily armed CIA ""grief counselors"" is a tightly choreographed set-piece that pays off. Later though there are fight scenes in which its impossible to tell whos hitting whom and a climactic motorcycle chase through the packed streets of Manila that manages to be fast noisy overlong and dull. Whats missing from ""Legacy"" is any emotional stake. Damons Jason Bourne--whos alluded to in the new film but seen only in a newscast--was a James Bond hero in the throes of an existential identity crisis and the actor let you feel the characters confusion and anger. As enjoyable as he is to watch Renners underwritten Cross doesnt carry the same weight. Theres a devilish comedy that you occasionally glimpse in the back of the stars eyes but hes too much of a pro to let it out. Weisz by contrast plays her role the way you or I would behave in a similar situation Shearing is completely freaked out. A novel approach but ""The Bourne Legacy"" isnt sure what to do with it. Its been a while in fact since Ive seen a movie fall apart so completely in its final 20 minutes. A new-model government super-assassin (Louis Ozawa Changchien) is abruptly introduced to chase down the heroes and the film suddenly turns into ""Terminator 2."" Nortons character drops down the rabbit hole Joan Allen and David Strathairn from the earlier movies suddenly reappear and ""The Bourne Legacy"" folds its hand with a limp romantic fade-out and a cheesy pop song. Dont expect the series to be back for a fifth movie either. It ran out of brain. [Editors note This story has been expanded with online bonus content.] Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

( ) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday August 9 2012 116 PM Title The Bourne Legacy Film Info With Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz. A rogue agent is targeted for assassination. Director Tony Gilroy (215). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. The biggest issue with ""The Bourne Legacy"" is right there in the title Can a new team put its stamp on a spy series already defined by departing star Matt Damon and former directors Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass? Bourne isnt Bond and its unlikely audiences would have accepted a new face on an old friend. So instead director/co-writer Tony Gilroy -- who also worked on the previous ""Bourne"" screenplays -- aims for a fresh start in a familiar setting. (The movie takes its title and nothing else from an Eric Van Lustbader novel based on Robert Ludlums characters). The introduction isnt as smooth as it could be but eventually everyone settles into the right groove. RELATED RENNER ON BEING RE-BOURNE Still stinging from Jason Bournes expose of the CIAs top-secret black ops program in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" the groups director (Edward Norton) is now terminating all agents left in the field. Operative Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) has managed to evade the CIAs assassination attempts thus far. But hes running out of the medication that keeps agents genetically enhanced and he needs more to survive. His only hope lies with Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) the scientist who helped develop the medical program. Unfortunately shes been targeted for termination too. Renner was brilliant in ""The Hurt Locker"" and clearly bored in ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol."" Hes the kind of actor who does best with a challenge. That makes this unusually intelligent series a good match for him and he rises to the occasion. He wont erase any memories of Damon but Renners turn is strong enough to stand on its own. Its also strong enough to carry the series forward which is obviously the ultimate aim if Damon and Greengrass cant be coerced into returning. Gilroy however has some work to do before hes ready for the next installment. For one thing no popcorn movie needs to be this complicated. It takes nearly an hour to lay out the overly intricate plot which is weighed down by too many peripheral characters and too much intercontinental cross-cutting. Also while it was smart to bring in a first-tier actress as Bournes love interest Weisz and Renner have so little chemistry that they seem less like a united team than a random mismatch. Once the pair is on the move though the action starts to feel swifter and more satisfying. Their high-pressure escape scenes including one through a maze-like Manila are all thrillingly true to the series spirit. In a leaner movie the final extended race against various villains is what wed remember most. Instead its half-buried inside a bloated 135 minutes. Renner deserves another shot but next time lets cut straight to the chase. Magic Moment A seemingly straightforward debriefing turns deadly.

Structurally yes its loaded with all the lies schemes and high-tech trickery that are staples of the espionage genre. But a deeper more individualistic source of tension propels the film along. Think of it as ""Drugstore Cowboy"" with an international scope and more explosions. That may help as you compare it with the first three films in the series that starred Matt Damon as Jason Bourne the amnesiac CIA assassin of Robert Ludlums novels and established Damon as the rare action star who can actually act. Comparison is inevitable especially given that a new leading man Jeremy Renner now plays the highly trained bad ass at the center of the films intrigue. And as a straight-up action flick ""The Bourne Legacy"" does come up a bit short except for one dizzying motorcycle chase through the streets of Manila. But it feels like Tony Gilroy is trying to do something different here something more cerebral and potentially less crowd-pleasing. Gilroy who wrote or co-wrote the previous three films (""The Bourne Identity"" ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"") takes over directing duties as well this time and it seems as if hes more interested in offering a character drama about desperation than a high-octane summer blockbuster. Not that ""The Bourne Legacy"" is free of thrills its just more grounded than spectacular. He lets the shootouts and chases play out in a more fluid fashion than the frenzied kinetic style thats the signature of Paul Greengrass who directed parts two and three. Renner stars as Aaron Cross whos alone in the wilds of Alaska on a training exercise at the films start. But he finds hes the target of a legitimate threat when the supersecret government spy program hes a part of hastily gets shut down with the exposure of Jason Bourne. Turns out Bourne was not the only person given a whole new identity - he was one of many and the new models are even bigger-better-faster-stronger thanks to a combination of little blue and green pills. His handlers including Edward Norton Stacy Keach and Donna Murphy may have done too good a job. Cross is hard to kill and Gilroy cuts back and forth between the spys resourceful globe-trotting efforts to stay alive and the shadowy surveillance rooms full of glowing monitors that illuminate his hunters growing frustration. Cross finds one ally though. Rachel Weisz plays Dr. Marta Shearing a research scientist at a pharmaceutical giant who becomes his reluctant partner on the run. She also finds herself a target when she becomes the lone survivor of a massive workplace shooting at her lab. (The deliberate carnage would have been unsettling anyway but it seems especially so now.) He needs to get his hands on more of the drugs she helped concoct or hell revert to his former normal self. She knows where to find them but its a long and messy slog. Weisz is literally and figuratively along for the ride called upon as she is to do little more than rattle off a lot of scientific jargon and persevere. That means its up to Renner to inject the film with some personality to find a balance between being engaging and deadly. And he succeeds in the first part of the film showing some of the flashes of exciting unpredictability he made his name on in ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""The Town."" Going through withdrawal does his character no favors and strands him in straightforward survival mode. But its clear from the final shot (which is part of a rather abrupt ending) that more adventures with Aaron Cross are in store.

By David Denby Jeremy Renner (right) inherits the ""Bourne"" franchise from Matt Damon.   Credit Illustration by Tim Tomkinson In ""The Bourne Legacy"" the screenwriter and director Tony Gilroy has given additional life to the restless franchise by coming up with a new running man Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner). Like Jason Bourne Cross is an unstoppable black-ops hard-ass who defies his superiors and keeps on moving when they try to eliminate him--racing from continent to continent across shantytown rooftops through crowded marketplaces down alleyways. He manages not to drive through the Alps (a favorite Bourne trip) but he humps over spiky Alaskan peaks on foot. Like Bourne hes very quick his body moves faster than our thoughts--hes always surprising us. As Jason Bourne Matt Damon was lean; Jeremy Renners strong torso is slightly rounded. He looks like a shotgun shell well packed and deadly. Renner who played the stolid bomb defuser in ""The Hurt Locker"" likes to do his own stunts here including a bruising vertiginous downward slide between two adjacent walls. (He lands on a bad guy.) A new hero has been launched. But is Renner a star? Im not so sure. ""The Bourne Legacy"" has some fine violent set pieces including the longest motorcycle chase in the history of wheels; the movie is basically enjoyable but it avoids the continuous motion of the previous two films (""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum""). In those movies the director Paul Greengrass working with the cinematographer Oliver Wood relied on a handheld camera always on the move which caught little pieces of action (a scowling face across the street a body crashing through a window)--fragments that were then edited into an impression of spatial unity. Greengrass perfected a mood of harried realism and breathless paranoia. Those of us who werent altogether confused by the two movies were left frazzled and exhausted but satisfied. Tony Gilroy however who worked on the earlier movies as a screenwriter never hid his distaste for Greengrasss work which tended to shred his words. After ""Ultimatum"" two new screenwriters attempted to write another ""Bourne"" movie for Greengrass but he disliked both scripts and he walked away taking Matt Damon with him. The task of keeping the franchise alive fell to Gilroy who wrote the new film with his brother Dan and directed it. This time the characters occasionally sit down and engage in conversation. The cinematographer--Robert Elswit who shot Gilroys directorial debut ""Michael Clayton""--favors a stable camera and an easily readable frame. Elswit may even have put the camera now and then on a tripod. The world has slowed--slightly. In an age of movie magic the ""Bourne"" series even at its most accelerated stuck to grounded action. Gravity mattered in all three films; stunt men falling earthward were more central than pixels. And you might say that Jason Bourne himself is a man looking for some solid turf to stand on. His identity has been wiped clean by the C.I.A.; he retains his lethal instincts but he doesnt know who he is. Adapted from Robert Ludlums lugubriously written novels the plots may have been nonsense but Bourne was the kind of hero--homeless haunted alienated from everyone even from himself--who revived some of the last centurys most resonantly forlorn themes. Bourne was existential man in extremis--melancholy and obsessed a fellow who could define himself only in violent action. He becomes a threat to the C.I.A. when his guilt and rage over what hes done as an assassin lead him to expose the secret operations--Treadstone and its successor Blackbriar--that he was part of. Tony and Dan Gilroy have linked their movie to the franchise in a way that Ive never seen before. The beginning of ""The Bourne Legacy"" runs concurrently with the end of ""Ultimatum."" Bourne as he did in the last film shows up in New York. We dont actually see him in ""Legacy"" but we see scenes repeated from ""Ultimatum"" of the C.I.A. panicking over his presence--David Strathairn as an agency honcho running around in a sweat shouting orders. You have to hand it to the Gilroys they turned a commercial necessity into a smart piece of narrative sausage-making. In the new movie Bournes revelations about Treadstone and Blackbriar threaten still another clandestine program. This one is called Outcome and its run not by the C.I.A. but by some retired military men including Turso (Stacy Keach) and Byer (Edward Norton) two sinister and very worried intelligence chiefs. Outcome were told has been fabulously successful but its usefulness will end if the public finds out about it. So Turso and Byer decide to terminate the program immediately in order to save it for the long run a devilishly clever stratagem that requires murdering all the current agents including Aaron Cross. The Gilroys appear to be betting that the audience will accept this move as utterly logical. In the previous ""Bourne"" films the C.I.A. was portrayed as evil corrupt and self-protecting; the military-intelligence types here are even meaner. Their weapon of choice in eliminating Cross is the Predator drone a patient but unpleasant flying machine; in effect they treat their own man as if he were a high-value terrorist. In the movies most amusing sequence Cross attempts to outwit a missile by using a hungry wolf as a warm-bodied lure. As in the earlier films the intelligence people sitting in darkened rooms in front of computers and screens remain convinced that they can lay eyes on anyone anywhere in the world and kill him. And the joke is that Cross like Bourne before him decoys them fools them and simply outruns them. The man on foot remains sovereign. Aaron Cross hasnt been brushed clean like Bourne; on the contrary hes been given drugs to enhance his physical and intellectual prowess. If Bourne was twentieth-century man Cross is twenty-first-century man a reengineered human being whose basic nature has been toyed with. Cross has become the ultimate pill freak he has to keep popping ""chems"" or he will undergo withdrawal and then God only knows what will happen to him. When he runs out of pills he links up with Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) a doctor who helped develop the chems and they go on the lam together in search of supply. At times as Renner shakes and worries the movie seems rather absurdly to be about an addict who needs his next fix. And theres a more fundamental confusion Will upping brain and body power lead to the latest version of Frankensteins monster or is it a good thing? Who wouldnt want to move as quickly as Jeremy Renner does? ""The Bourne Legacy"" is somewhat more relaxed than the earlier films but its also more conventional Rachel Weiszs doctor is scared a lot of the time (the Outcome thugs are trying to get rid of her too) and Cross gallantly looks after her. Weisz emotes mightily; shes a sincere accomplished actress with a talent for regret and tears but she seems overwrought for this kind of thriller. Renner stoic much of the time looks at her with gratitude but not with desire. We rarely know what hes thinking; we dont feel close to him. Hes an enormously capable actor physically but one cant help recalling the way Matt Damon offered little flickers of recognition and dismay as Bournes memory came back in pieces. Damons hero was a vividly suffering man. The new movie continues the ""Bourne"" tradition of exciting reality-based thrillers but when the series lost its star it lost most of its soul. Spike Lees new Brooklyn-set film ""Red Hook Summer"" which is about a boy from Atlanta who spends the hot months with his grandfather is a clear failure yet Lee is getting at things that mystify him and I was touched by parts of the movie. ""Red Hook Summer"" is a lament for a community that got stuck in time. (A mood of elegiac bitterness may now come naturally to Lee--it was a central emotion in ""When the Levees Broke A Requiem in Four Acts"" his magnificent New Orleans documentary from 2006.) In projects built in the nineteen-thirties when Red Hook was still a neighborhood serving a busy port a group of African-Americans are hanging on devoting most of their energy to a small wood-panelled Baptist church called Lil Peace of Heaven. The church is run by the boys grandfather Enoch Rouse (Clarke Peters) an eloquent preacher who cant stop thanking Jesus for everything good in life. Not much happens to the boy over the summer; hes a wary kid who carries an iPad 2 everywhere taking pictures of the world and hiding behind the screen. The focus shifts to Enoch whos carrying a secret from his past that bursts out about two-thirds through the movie without any preparation or adequate resolution. Structurally the picture is a mess. Yet Lee inside that church creates moods of outright rapture. He celebrates the intense joy that religion brings to the community--and at the same time seems to be asking whether repeated emotionally overwhelming professions of faith dont reconcile people to stasis and failure. Its a bitter question and he doesnt offer an answer but not many people working in movies would have the courage even to pose it.

The summer movie season wheezing along on formula and throwaway comedy for the younguns briefly gives way to a brainy new entry in the Bourne franchise.Bourne remains comfort food for action fans who dont like checking their heads at the door and dont mind a whiff of real-world menace.The Bourne Legacy with a new star (Jeremy Renner) and new director (longtime Bourne screenwriter Tony Gilroy) misses nary a beat; if anything it ratchets up the tension for the series fourth time around. The details are scarier the stakes higher. The climactic action scene a white-knuckle motorcycle chase through the jampacked streets of Manila is a classic of its kind much like the movie itself.Legacy begins like a compressed spring ready to uncoil but in no hurry to do so. Two elite government agents (Renner and Oscar Isaac) size each other up and make cryptic small talk in a remote Alaskan cabin unsure whether theyre supposed to help or kill each other. Some will find the long windup tedious. I loved the suggestion of threat in every shot the tension that boils down to two operative words Trust nobody.Especially not your government and we dont mean that in a tea party kind of way. The national security umbrella overseen by a tightly wound Edward Norton is more expansive than we realized. Its in the performance-enhancing drug business and the goal isnt to hit more home runs. Norton and his operatives are building genetically superior super spies then eliminating them and the scientists behind the scenes when program background starts leaking.Gilroy who also wrote the screenplay with his brother Dan weaves an intricate tale just realistic enough to be creepy. If the plot seems overly complex -- and sometimes it is -- this might help The action in Legacy unfolds concurrently with the events of the previous film The Bourne Ultimatum which plays like a feedback loop in the background. In that movie a journalist was taken down for getting too close to the truth (we see the assassination again here). This time there are more targets more means to ends of hazy morality.Renner is a grittier star than Matt Damon the series original flag bearer. Hes a Cagney-like ball of coiled energy who knows how to shift gears and bring some humanity to a scenario where that can get you killed. When he goes on the lam with the excellent Rachel Weisz a genetic scientist and loose end the relentless mechanism of The Bourne Legacy gains a human face of desperation. They are the hunted and as we cheer them on we are as well.The Bourne movies thrive on the thrill of the unknown or at least the partly known. No action movies reveal information at such a frenetic pace from such odd angles. Gilroy has been around the franchise from the start and he finds a satisfying medium between the previous directors disparate styles the cool jazz tones of Doug Liman and the shaky-cam faux-documentary approach of Paul Greengrass. And so the series keeps humming along a welcome tonic for the season of parched imagination.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.The Bourne Legacy(A-) Directed by Tony Gilroy.

The Bourne Legacy Fair Director Tony Gilroy. Cast Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz Edward Norton. Rating PG-13 for violence and action sequences. Its downright brainy sometimes too much so. All that ... science. Gets in the way of the action. But thats not the films real problem. What finally drags it down is its last act which has to try too hard to set up another sequel and introduces a plot element out of nowhere. ""The Bourne Identity"" ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" were intelligent action-packed films that proved Matt Damon wasnt just a good actor but could play a pretty swell action hero as well. The idea that the franchise could continue without him was dicey at best. Interview Jeremy Renner But Tony Gilroy who co-wrote all of the previous ""Bourne"" movies signed on to direct and co-write ""The Bourne Legacy."" Jeremy Renner stepped in as the main character. Its a different character (the only way to pull this off and to hold out any kind of hope that Damon might return). Renner plays Aaron Cross an Operation Outcome agent kind of like Bourne but he regularly pops pills and injects himself for reasons we dont know yet (though they arent too hard to guess). He performs super-duper feats in the snowy woods when we first see him including fighting off a pesky pack of wolves. Meanwhile in New York Jason Bourne (Damon seen only in photos) is believed to be on the run which is reason enough for CIA honcho Eric Byer (Edward Norton always a welcome presence) to shut the whole program down. And when it comes to the agents that doesnt mean a new assignment. It means death. Its not exactly a gold watch and severance pay for the scientists who have been working on the project either. Without revealing too much after some lengthy setup and a couple of nifty action pieces Cross and one of those scientists Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) are on the lam heading for Manila to find the medicine that will keep Cross both physically superior and mentally acute. In one of the movies better scenes we learn along the way just why he is so desperate to maintain the gifts hes been given but that information comes and goes too quickly to register as powerfully as it might have. Renner is a good actor but not as charismatic as Damon. Other than that one scene we dont know much about Cross which is probably handy when youre supposed to be an anonymous killing machine but less satisfying when youre rebuilding a movie franchise around someone. Weisz brings a realistic desperation to her character who is confused upset and more than a little afraid for most of the movie. Unfortunately desperation is also the word that comes to mind when Gilroy brings in an out-of-the-blue plot development late in the game. By that point the film is struggling with an exit strategy; how to end in a satisfying manner while leaving the door open for a sequel? A long pedal-to-the-metal chase scene is the route taken here. Taken on its own terms ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a pretty good action thriller. But it suffers from what its really up to setting the table for another franchise while trying to trade on the charms of the first one. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Jeremy Renner is Matt Damons summer replacement in the intelligent but unnecessary fourth installment of thrillers from the Robert Ludlum franchise By Richard Corliss Aug. 09 2012 Share Read Later Universal Pictures The Bourne Legacy Year 2012 Director Tony Gilroy Studio Universal Pictures Actors Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz Edward Norton Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture ""The Bourne Redundancy."" Thats what Paul Greengrass who had directed the last two Jason Bourne movies proposed as the title of any future installment. When thereve been three movies about the spy with an identity crisis and the third episode was called Ultimatum why go on? But for the brass at Universal Pictures the question was Why stop now? Worldwide box-office revenue for movies made from the Robert Ludlum novels had ballooned from 214 million for the 2002 Identity to 288.5 million for the 2004 Supremacy to 442.8 million for the 2007 Ultimatum. Thats close to a billion dollars for three movies. Any studio boss would want to go for four. So though Greengrass passed on another Bourne and star Matt Damon also said no Tony Gilroy whod co-scripted the first three films signed on as director co-writer and keeper of the franchise. The Bourne Legacy with The Hurt Lockers Jeremy Renner as the new hero has a couple of scenes crackling with fatal friction plus lots of talking that implicates the CIA as Worst Government Agency Ever; but the overall tone is familiar refried redundant. The comment that U.S. Intelligence guru Edward Norton makes of his colleagues -- ""We are morally indefensible and absolutely necessary"" -- applies to the film as well. The Bourne Legacy has no compelling reason to be except as a continuing geyser of profits. Which to any Hollywood studio is absolutely necessary. (MORE Tony Gilroy tells Stephanie Abrahams why a new Bourne is necessary) The coolest part of this movie is the ad line ""There was never just one."" Renners Aaron Cross is part of a new CIA program. Hes one of nine secret agents all injected with super-meds to increase their strength speed stamina and cunning. Theyre spies on steroids gaining the same advantage on their rivals as some baseball players a decade ago; the film could be called The Bonds Legacy. Its a wonder the producers of the James Bond films didnt diversify their hero this way. After 007 there could have been 008 and 009 -- The Bond Legacy. But the whole point of the Bond films was that despite the myriad spy-movie imitators there was always just one Bond. These days through the miracle of 21st-century medicine and Hollywood habit a secret agent can be Bourne again and again and again. In the screenplay by Gilroy and his brother Dan we find Cross in the Alaskan woods a lone surviver in the killing chill. In his spare time he engages in an ultimate fight with a ferocious wolf as if trying to out-macho Liam Neeson in The Grey. A spy who is literally ready to come in from the cold -- to be brought back to D.C. by the agency he works for -- Cross finds himself the target of a U.S. drone attack. Wait a minute the guys in Bethesda at their video consoles are supposed to eliminate the odd Taliban rebel and Afghani civilian not their most resourceful agent. In these scenes Legacy connects with the real crime of modern warfare where the shooters at Mission Control can isolate a human target 10000 miles away and kill him without risking anything but their honor. (MORE Corlisss review of The Bourne Ultimatum) But enough brain food. Soon its back to fulfilling genre conventions rooftop rambles reckless driving and the globe-trotting location shoots (New York Chicago D.C. Seoul Karachi Manila) that turn filmmakers into frequent flyers. Also imperiled romance in the person of microbiologist Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz). The good doctor works at the company that hatched Crosss enabling deadly medication though she wanly protests ""I was there for science"" As his one link to the meds Marta must run from the CIA -- theres a nicely tense interrogation with a motherly psychologist who explodes into a lethal agent -- and get Cross to the manufacturing plant in Manila. Toward the end Legacy promises a battle between Cross and a next-generation killer a sort of Terminator Bourne; but that climactic brawl is reduced to the sort of car chase youve seen before and better in roughly 126 action films. Most moviegoers wont mind that the Legacy tropes are familiar; thats why they go to the movies. What theyll notice is the new leading man in the wake of Damons defection. Renner is a curious candidate for a Hollywood action figure. Not a dreamy hunk by any means hes a valued supporting player recently promoted to leading roles. Go back 40 years and hes Gene Hackman with muscles (every actor has muscles now) but with the suggestion of a less roiling interior life. That was exactly Renners salient quality in Kathryn Bigelows The Hurt Locker. Dismantling bombs in Baghdad his Sgt. James was all business no introspection; he was what he did. Sure James could have been driven by infernal forces or a grand mission but no he was just a guy supremely good at his job and putting his expertise to life-saving use. (MORE Corliss on Renner in The Hurt Locker) Renners anonymity worked splendidly in The Hurt Locker. Since then in standard-issue action fare like The Avengers and the fourth Mission Impossible he has looked uncomfortable trying to Act when the other performers more used to the cameras rapt gaze know how to simulate having a good time. Now a star without star quality Renner plays it a little too nice as the junked-up renegade spy. The Cross character has no backstory to clue the viewer to deep roilings and Renner can suggest sullenness but not satanic or superhuman threat. If Sgt. James was a man who defused and fused with machines Cross is more machine than man a total creation of his CIA overlords -- their quiet-spoken Frankenstein. Or you could say Cross is a drone in human form efficient but impersonal like this redundant Legacy.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Mary Cybulski) Mary Cybulski This film image released by Universal Pictures shows Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross in a scene from ""The Bourne Legacy."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Mary Cybulski) In 2002 ""The Bourne Identity"" provided a shot of adrenaline for action movies. It spawned two excellent sequels and inspired James Bond to get into better shape. But after Matt Damon as the amnesiac CIA agent dove into the Hudson River the actor took a hiatus and the producers hedged their bets. Behold Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross aka Ken Kitsom the army-grunt-turned-superhuman-spy in ""The Bourne Legacy.""With ""Bourne"" trilogy screenwriter Tony Gilroy graduating to the directors chair this start to a potential spinoff series is more introductory than intense. But Renner has the physical presence to be an action star and the stoic demeanor to play an undercover operative (if not Damons charisma) so this intelligent movie is a sure step in a new direction.When we meet Cross he is deep in the Alaska wilderness honing survival skills that are enhanced by a regimen of pills. His ""chems"" are the fruit of a top-secret research project to build a better assassin. But rumors about the project have leaked to the press and the head of the spy division called Outcome (Edward Norton) wants to squelch the program even if it means poisoning several agents hiding in hotspots around the globe. When Cross learns theres a price on his head he contacts the only person he can trust Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) the research chemist who administers his blood tests. But the cutthroats are after her too and the scared scientist goes on the lam with Cross--to Manila where a factory produces pills that have boosted his strength and IQ. Until Cross is caught in a Manila motorcycle chase against the Thai 2.0 version of himself ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a slow cousin to the previous trilogy. Most of the film is a familiar manhunt from mission control. And its frustratingly unclear how Cross mission is related to Jason Bourne whos reportedly on the loose in New York while the CIA is betraying his handler (Joan Allen). But Gilroys articulate script never resorts to catchphrases or far-fetched technology. And it bodes well for the future of the franchise that Renner and Weisz share not only a gripping predicament but something more important chemistry.

With a new star a new director and a new high-tech twist the paranoid Bourne franchise enters the CIA drone age Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Action movies Espionage Jeremy Renner Movies The Bourne Legacy Thrillers Entertainment News Jeremy Renner in ""The Bourne Legacy"" Its easy to be cynical about Hollywoods insatiable desire for sequels and remakes based on audience ""pre-awareness"" and indeed I am cynical about it in this space week after week. In the case of ""The Bourne Legacy"" though something interesting has transpired something that reminds us that in projects of this scale you can never be quite sure whos essential and whos not. Star Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass walked away from this satisfyingly dense and paranoid amnesiac-assassin franchise after the terrific ""Bourne Ultimatum"" in 2007 and the whole thing appeared to be toast.But Universal Pictures was understandably loath to bid farewell to the most lucrative non-Bond enterprise in globetrotting spy cinema and convinced screenwriter Tony Gilroy a key factor in the initial trilogy to slide into the directors chair. You have to give both the studio and the filmmaker credit for ingenuity here because Gilroy solves the central problem of ""The Bourne Legacy"" - introducing a new hero and launching a new narrative - with remarkable dexterity. While I dont think this movie can compete with the second and third Bourne films for pure thrills and plot convolutions Jeremy Renner makes an immensely likable action star and the world of international spycraft Gilroy depicts has a high-tech cold-blooded authenticity that feels fully up to date in the age of real-life CIA drone assassinations.Matt Damon never appears on screen in ""The Bourne Legacy"" -- if that counts as a spoiler Im like so sorry -- but his character is mentioned several times and the action of this film intersects and overlaps with the action of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" at numerous points. (I suppose it would be honorable to avoid spoilers for that earlier film too but honestly if you didnt see it a lot of this one wont make sense.) Renner plays a chemically enhanced super-secret operative named Aaron Cross whos on a training exercise in the Alaskan wilderness when he abruptly becomes a target for official liquidation. What Cross doesnt know (but we do) is that Jason Bourne has resurfaced in New York and a British journalist (Paddy Considine) is preparing to reveal all sorts of dirty secrets from the cutting edge of American intelligence. (Those events are central to ""Bourne Ultimatum"" but form the background here.) So the kinds of shadowy higher-ups who make the CIA leadership look like Alex Trebek have decided to torch not just Bournes program but the even scarier one Cross is part of as well.Renner gives a performance thats focused masculine and unpretentious pretty much everything you want from the hero of this kind of movie. Still Im not yet convinced hes going to be a major movie star which has almost nothing to do with his acting. He seems a little too introspective maybe too nice. He doesnt quite have the brash borderline-creepy charisma of a Cruise or a Crowe or a Gibson or a Schwarzenegger. Anyway Cross charges around the world from Alaska to Chicago to Washington to the Philippines in search of the secret Nietzschean pharmacology without which hes just a normal guy. Along the way he picks up a wide-eyed government scientist played by Rachel Weisz who has come very close to becoming collateral damage in the official campaign to stamp out everyone and everything who knows about the bad stuff. You Might Also Like Gilroy stages some tense shootout sequences and a hair-raising motorcycle chase through the streets and back alleys of Manila but as with the other ""Bourne"" films hes written or co-written the meaty center lies in the ambiguous portrayal of undemocratic or anti-democratic power and those who wield it. Edward Norton - whos staging a mini-comeback of late as a top-tier character actor -- nearly steals the whole movie as Eric Byer a retired Air Force officer devoted to hunting Cross down.It isnt personal for Byer a man who speaks in the clipped bureaucratic banalities of middle management in order to distance himself from what he actually does. As he tells Cross in a flashback sequence the secret spookery they engage in is ""morally indefensible and absolutely necessary."" While thats probably not Gilroys position this is a Hollywood thriller not a New York Times Op-Ed. Whats striking about the entire Bourne franchise is its matter-of-fact depiction of espionage as a world of total ruthlessness in which avowed patriots will slaughter their own agents en masse rather than risk public discovery. This isnt the jingoistic bluster of ""24"" where unlikely scenarios are dreamed up in order to justify Arab or Russian bad guys. This is something closer to a chilly blend of Orwell and John le Carre in which ""national security"" becomes a shibboleth independent of human life or morality or even civilization. Gilroys reboot (co-written with his brother Dan Gilroy) also features delicious supporting performances from veteran stage actress Donna Murphy and familiar TV face Zeljko Ivanek as zealous assassin types along with briefer appearances from old reliables like Stacy Keach Scott Glenn David Strathairn and Albert Finney. ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a lean clean killing machine that supplies some dark late-summer thrills and chills and breathes new life into a seemingly extinct franchise. Im genuinely not sure whether the Bourne universe taken as a whole acts as more of a stimulant or a narcotic Does it encourage us to pay attention to the fact that our country has an enormous international secret police or does it encourage us not to care. At any rate this installment is too blatantly meant as the first chapter of a new trilogy almost literally leaving its characters and their Keystone Kops chase - along with its purported moral questions - suspended in mid-air awaiting the application of more millions of our dollars.

The Bourne Legacy (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Bourne Legacy (PG-13) Jeremy Renner takes over for Matt Damon in the fourth installment of the spy-on-the-run film franchise. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com8/9/2012 Editor rating 2 You spend the first 25 minutes of The Bourne Legacy perplexed and confused. Who is Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) and why is he in Alaska swimming shirtless in sub-zero temperatures climbing mountains and fighting off wolves? What is the deal with the ex-military dude (Edward Norton) who stares grimly at computer screens barks orders and jabs his finger in peoples faces? What is the importance of the beautiful scientist (Rachel Weisz) rocking the white lab coat in a high-tech research facility? Also where the hell is Matt Damon? The star of the previous three Bourne movies does not appear in this fourth (and forced) installment of the franchise. He is sorely missed. Tasked with advancing the series without its star writer-director Tony Gilroy opts for something more ambitious than the usual reboot route. He gives us a parallel tale taking place simultaneously during the events of The Bourne Ultimatum in which the government decides to eradicate a group of genetically-altered super-agents used to carry out shady missions (a new even more advanced breed is ready to replace them). But Cross who is one of the soldiers deemed obsolete isnt willing to go quietly. In his previous movies Gilroy (Duplicity Michael Clayton) displayed a flair for tangled playful narratives that rewarded close attention and doled out wonderful third-act bombs of surprise. One of the biggest disappointments in The Bourne Legacy is that there is so little to the movie beneath its cluttered busy surface. Once the narrative groundwork is laid down the picture repeats the familiar Bourne formula of shady government types using technology to chase down a rogue agent. Occasionally they send a hired gun. Renner is solid and dependable in supporting roles (The Avengers Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol) but hes not leading-man material He doesnt have the soul and charisma needed to carry a giant movie like this one and he gets drowned out by the noise. By comparison Weiszs panicked scientist who doesnt understand why her co-workers are suddenly trying to kill her is engaging and believable and does more with the damsel-in-distress part than you might have thought possible. In one of the films best moments she gradually realizes the company psychiatrist who has come to her home to evaluate her mental state may have another more sinister motive. Weisz plays the scene so well you actually believe her character is in mortal peril even though she hasnt been in the movie nearly long enough to get bumped off. Besides The Bourne Legacy isnt the sort of picture that takes risks other than to see just how loud James Newton Howards score can go without causing permanent deafness in the audience. There is one fabulous set piece in the movie a methodical mass-murder/suicide that is shot and edited with harrowing horrifying expertise. As skilled a writer as he is Gilroy is also a gifted filmmaker. The last half-hour of the film is one enormous action sequence in Manila -- a chase by foot car and motorcycle -- that must have been exceptionally difficult to shoot and even harder to edit together. It looks fantastic but its also hard to sit through because by that point The Bourne Legacy has repeatedly proven there are no surprises to be had here no more fresh stories to be mined from this well. The stunts look exhausting though. No wonder Damon bailed. Cast Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz Edward Norton Donna Murphy Oscar Isaac Zeljko Ivanek Stacy Keach. Director Tony Gilroy.

"Bourne Legacy Review Franchise weakens as it branches off - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Bourne Legacy Franchise weakens as it branches off August 09 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie critic""The Bourne Identity."" ""The Bourne Supremacy.""""The Bourne Ultimatum.""And now ""The Pointless Confused and Then For the Last Half-Hour Exciting Bourne Sequel After a Fashion"" more commonly known as""The Bourne Legacy.""Its not really a prequel. Nor is it a sequel. I might be wrong but I think its a parallel line of a movie running more or less alongside the action and shadowy doings of the previous ""Bournes"" this time with Jeremy Renner in the lead.He does not play Jason Bourne. Jason Bourne isnt in ""The Bourne Legacy."" Renner plays Aaron Cross another one of the highly trained killers in a related supersecret U.S. government program. Because the here-unseen Bourne refuses to be killed by the Central Intelligence Agency everythings in disarray for the program known as Outcome.""The Bourne Legacy"" pits Cross against his own set of would-be assailants and sends him running running running alongside a research scientist played by Rachel Weisz also targeted for early retirement by assassination.The second and third ""Bourne"" pictures directed with ferocious skill and a refreshingly adult brand of moral complication by Paul Greengrass told simple stories simply in narrative terms through largely nonverbal means. Tony Gilroy served as primary screenwriter on the trilogy -- or as Universal Pictures puts it in its ""Bourne Legacy"" materials the ""narrative architect"" -- and here he takes over as director. (The script was co-written by his brother Dan Gilroy.)The results invert the ""Bourne"" formula. The new movie is visually more conventional. But narratively its a pretzel half-baked. The first hour makes a full investment in Cross isolated existence difficult because Gilroy risks a considerable amount of whats-happening-exactly? vexation. Hes an interesting writer no question His caper film ""Duplicity"" which I enjoyed tanked largely because of its looping flashbacks and nutty obfuscations starting with the brawl on the tarmac between two supporting players. Even Gilroys well-regarded script for""Michael Clayton""was fancier structurally than needed. ""The Bourne Legacy"" is Gilroys revenge; its all corkscrews and the script periodically stops dead to explain itself or deliver the dreaded expositional back story before cranking up the action again.And then a little past the nick of time it gets pretty good. When the story zips to Manila the resulting foot chases vehicular chases and whatnot take center stage (especially the whatnot) and nobody says anything worth hearing for a while and thats just the way international action audiences prefer their action.Some choice espionage scowlers from the previous ""Bourne"" films sidle into frame for brief cameos among them Joan Allen Albert Finney David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. New on board Edward Norton as the ambivalent program overseer and Stacy Keach as an authority figure whos seen it all and doesnt want anybody to see or question anything.Renner looks a little flummoxed by having to take over this weird addendum to the ""Bourne"" trilogy made famous by Matt Damon. Without Greengrass knack for staging and framing complicated sequences on the brink of pure chaos as well as Greengrass sly sociopolitical critique and near-abstract sense of plotting ""The Bourne Legacy"" offers only garden-variety spy games though they have the modest virtue of getting less obtuse as they lurch forward.""We are morally indefensible and absolutely necessary"" Norton says of his Outcome grads at one point. The film itself is less necessary.mjphillipstribune.comThe Bourne Legacy -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for violence and intense action sequences)Running time 215Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesThe Bourne LegacyAugust 6 2012U pushed Bourne one week to Aug. 10 Pic avoids Total...June 22 2012Greengrass career moves to its own tuneOctober 8 2013Revamped Bourne captures movie box office crownAugust 12 2012Bourne again at domestic B.O. with 40 milAugust 12 2012Find More Stories AboutJason BourneBourne SupremacyBourne UltimatumBourne IdentityTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0807-bourne-legacy-20120809,0,1685545.column",200,thebournelegacy33,thebournelegacy,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The fight sequences in the Bourne series are short on roundhouses uppercuts or anything like the wind-up from a Popeye cartoon--just fists or fury quick and devastating preceded by a minimum of talk. That was the core aesthetic of 2002s The Bourne Identity which answered a decade of bloated action movies with a fleet efficient no-frills thriller built around a hero whos an enigma even to himself. The second two entries The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum both directed by Paul Greengrass added the docu-realist texture of his Bloody Sunday while his star Matt Damon refined the latest in a career full of characters with slippery identities. With Greengrass and Damon gone writer-director Tony Gilroy--who scripted all three entries and proved he was a more-than-capable director with Michael Clayton and Duplicity--takes the franchise back to square one with The Bourne Legacy as if no one will remember the other three films existed. What was fresh a decade ago now seems like boilerplate. Some of the mythology does remain. Gilroy ingeniously layers Bournes exposure of Operation Blackbriar with the CIAs decision to shut down another secret black-ops program Operation Outcome by wiping out its field agents and any other disposables with knowledge of its human-engineering experiments. Jeremy Renner makes a capable Damon replacement as a super-agent whos first seen scaling the mountains of Alaska before the powers-that-be led by Edward Norton order a hit on him and various unsuspecting operatives. After escaping a surprise attack Renner hooks up with an Outcome scientist (Rachel Weisz) who also slips a death sentence and the pair works together to expose the perpetrators while dodging bullets. Working from Eric Van Lustbaders book--fitting that Van Lustbader is also a fill-in for original Bourne author Robert Ludlum--Gilroy does the unforgivable by turning out a lean thriller at a fatty 135 minutes mainly by making the conspiracy plot far more complicated than it needs to be. Once Renner and Weisz finally join forces The Bourne Legacy rebottles much of the chemistry that Damon and Franka Potente shared in the first film like an us-against-the-world Stockholm syndrome. The action sequences are cleaner but less distinctive than those in the Greengrass Bournes adding to the impression that Gilroys back-to-basics approach involves little more than mashing the reset button. As any Bourne character can testify you can never go home again.

Now that Damon has taken his leave of the series that secured his stardom its time for another one of those operatives to go rogue in ""The Bourne Legacy."" Enter Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) a recruit enhanced on a genetic level as part of the Outcome program a literal evolution of the previous films Treadstone and Blackbriar projects which Bourne helped to publicly expose at the end of 2007s ""Ultimatum."" His actions have resulted in a backroom scramble led by Eric Byer (Edward Norton) to eliminate all evidence which includes disposing of test subjects and lab scientists alike. Cross escapes a drone attack in the Alaskan wilderness while Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) recovers from a cold-blooded workplace shooting spree and together they flee to the Philippines in order to ensure their mutual survival. As helmed by series standby Tony Gilroy (""Michael Clayton"" ""Duplicity"") ""Legacy"" runs concurrent with the events of the last film hardly skipping a beat to name-drop Jason Bourne in an effort to both explain his absence and allow for his potential return. The fundamental mystery of his identity is removed from the plot though and if anything Cross is aware and afraid of his past not regretful of it. Should Cross run out of his precious ""chems"" his brain will eventually pull a ""Flowers For Algernon"" but until then hes harder better faster stronger than Bourne could ever be. Whats more Renners performance allows for greater empathy than that of Damons blunt-force weapon and his physicality is certainly well-suited to the series trademark fight and chase scenes. However these sequences often regress to the visual confusion that held back 2004s ""Supremacy"" before director Paul Greengrass subtly refined his handheld approach for ""Ultimatum"" and the echoes of the earlier films plague them otherwise. An attack on Martas home resembles the Paris ambush in ""Identity"" while a lengthy third-act pursuit across rooftops and on motorcycles -- easily this films highlight -- is essentially an inversion of Bourne saving Julia Stiles Nicky in Tangiers during ""Ultimatum."" Before we even reach that point Gilroy labors to establish the particulars of these interchangeable black-ops programs stranding Norton in a generic control room barking orders whenever vague authority figure Stacy Keach isnt and burdening Weisz with constant science jargon -- I hope you like the word ""viral"" used as a verb -- when not waiting to be rescued. (Two smart responses on her characters part do not a strong heroine make.) Furthermore the science at play seems a bit far-fetched for the generally realistic world of the series to date. Bourne was an everyman who came to realize that he was trained to kill; Cross knows his exceptional capabilities and will do anything to keep them. The emotional stakes have been muted the romance feels half-hearted and the thematic relevance of the original trilogy has been lowered from a righteous drive to a dull roar. Talented actors like Oscar Isaac Corey Stoll and the returning Joan Allen and David Strathairn go to waste and the main plot to take out every assassin seems handily undone when its time to introduce an antagonist (Louis Ozawa Changchien) whose capacity for empathy has been dialed down as the rest of his skills have been amped up. It all comes to an anti-climactic close to the familiar strains of Mobys ""Extreme Ways"" keeping in line with the frustrating franchise-driven filmmaking previously personified by ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" ""Prometheus"" and games of Jenga. Damons entries may have tied into one another but at least the stories they told were individually satisfying and whole. Regarding their secret weapon in the Far East one analyst spits out that ""hes Treadstone without the inconsistencies."" It seems that ""Legacy"" is ""Bourne"" with some added in.

The symbolism works elegantly. Renners Cross is a conflicted hero built to take advantage of the Hurt Locker stars best qualities as an actor -- his default intensity the way he conveys that complicated mental calculations are taking place under cover of watchful stillness even underwater. Director and co-writer Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton) has custom-tailored The Bourne Legacy for the present by opening up the narrative. Unnerving scenes of backroom operations among shadowy governmental and private-enterprise types reveal the machinations of a much bigger more nefarious tangle of players than previously imagined. There are mystery men running the country -- and by remote control the world. This movie recommends worrying. Meanwhile Cross is currently the agent in the crosshairs. To his handlers hes only ""No. 5"" one of six experimental warriors chemically enhanced for use by the Department of Defense in an operation called Outcome -- sort of the 2.0 of the original trilogys Treadstone. But now his masters (led by an effectively steely Edward Norton) want to eradicate all evidence that Outcome ever existed by destroying these six superagents. In desperation he turns for help to the pharmaceutical scientist who ""created"" his enhanced capabilities (Rachel Weisz a good choice and from the looks of her a good runner). Soon the two are sprinting for their lives together. Like any story with Bourne in the title this one scampers around the globe with a big chunk of well-crafted showdown action set in teeming Manila. Gilroy who as a screenwriter has shaped the movie saga from the beginning trades the wired rhythms established in the past two episodes by Paul Greengrass for something more realistic and closer to the ground. The change is refreshing. Jason Bournes legacy is in good hands. A- Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

""Asshole cinema"" seems vulgar yet appropriate; the rage comes less from an inflamed Chayefskian idealism than a sheer joy in dressing down subordinates. Writer-director Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton) is one of the forms chief practitioners In The Bourne Legacy we begin with CIA director Scott Glenn getting reamed by a grumbly Stacy Keach. Then the higher-level spook is harshly disciplined by ferocious data-analyst Edward Norton top-dogging the top dog. Even when the movie cuts away to a lowly lab chief in Manila the guy can be seen jabbing his finger and shouting things like ""You"" or ""Stay where you are"" The problem with all of it is that were still discussing a movie about spies running around on rooftops. The verbal heavy-lifting gets ridiculous in light of the silliness of the storys X-Men-ready genetic-mutation plot--Jeremy Renners new agent desperately requires his meds--and its generic Bond-like chase through multiple cities. Renner and scientist Rachel Weisz are sympathetic enough (although lacking in Matt Damons all-American approachability) and the movie flies along briskly. Its topped by a dangerous-looking motorcycle chase that must count as one of the movies finest. Blessedly the nameless pursuer has absolutely no dialogue.

Wednesday August 8 2012 at 4 a.m. By Michael Atkinson 1 Jeremy Renner jumping right inCourtesy Universal Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The Bourne films have more than just overstayed their welcome and outlasted the Ludlum books--theyve been Van Halenized with an abrupt change of frontman and a resulting dip in personality. The only big-ass popcorn franchise of the past decade to have not been spawned on computers the series up to now has survived via Matt Damons beady gaze making decisions about where the story goes even as director Paul Greengrasss jittery action fuzz did its best to render the set pieces of the past two entries almost unwatchable. (Doug Limans initial film maybe because it eschews the safe harmlessness of CGI still pulses with panic and still freezes the channel-surfing thumb in mid click.) Now we have Jeremy Renner as another Treadstone mega man (there were nine apparently) and though he is a likable enough pug-nosed action figure the Damonlessness is sorely felt.Renner is not stranded by himself--The Bourne Legacy is chockablock with busy character-actor casting from Edward Nortons nasally fed bulldog to fleeting cameos by David Strathairn Scott Glenn Albert Finney and Joan Allen. (For the extra work of a Guardian journalist whos killed without a line of dialogue they even bothered to get Paddy Considine.) The film is as densely packed with officious people and global villages as Syriana and takes itself about as seriously. Mostly though Renner has on-the-run scientist helpmate Rachel Weisz who is 41 going on 23 and brings a badly needed full-throated payload of personal energy to her tagalong scenes even though theyre just that.Given the films relentless slam-blam effect its rather amazing that anybody gets to act at all. (James Newton Howards score is abusive with every mere establishing shot of Tokyo or Chicago getting a brontosaurs soundtrack stomp.) But acting does happen mostly in a two-sentence splats just enough to kick the narrative one more foot down the highway on its way to the inevitable showdown. Theres a lot of pensive screen-watching in dark surveillance rooms.Film Details The Bourne Legacy RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time135 More Info Trailer Tony Gilroy on his fourth Bourne and now unleashed from Ludlums paperbacks (the subsequent Eric Van Lustbader sequels even the one titled The Bourne Legacy were not consulted) overplots in the Christopher Nolan manner. But Gilroy was smart enough to make room for juicy dramatics After the films lengthy centerpiece begins with a hairy workplace-shooting ordeal that Weisz survives she heads to her crumbling fixer-upper mansion in the woods where shes visited by seemingly concerned feds. Antics ensue but only after a hearty dose of old-school interpersonal tension. The story in general takes a while to hit gears but its primary task is revealing the broader program from which Bourne arose and the pharmaceutical basis of its behavioral modifications. Renners Aaron Cross first met fighting off wolves in Alaska is a pill- popping uber-mensch who suddenly realizes as per Nortons bureaucratic fiat that the program is being shut down and its progeny eliminated one by one. Hes motivated to survive the onslaught (at first via drone) but also to score more uber-dope; Weiszs lab geek agrees to help only after realizing shes being hunted too.This presents a dynamic Damon might not have enjoyed Without his meds the quick-minded Cross would revert back to his old learning-disabled self like the experimental subject in Flowers for Algernon. (""Ive got a long way to fall"" Cross says grumbling.) You cant blame the lug though the notion that only a daily dose of ""viral"" beanies was all Damons Bourne needed to be Bourne is disenchanting to say the least. The exposition supporting this chemical backstory fills the eddies in the action flow in ways the Bourne movies never required before and the techno-gibberish flies like confetti.Bourne were told is also still evading assassination somewhere and perhaps Universal is hoping for a Damon/Greengrass reunion for number five which well call The Bourne Redundancy for now. Renner might just be a placeholder. Working in the trenches so he can eventually make himself another Michael Clayton Gilroy keeps things brisk and relatively smart but he cant be surprised if we find the rooftop-n-motorcycle chase through Manila a little rote by now however white-knuckly and free of Greengrass camera palsy. The late-in-the-game introduction of a supervillain--a Bourne 2.0 from a ""beta program"" flown in from Bangkok in white skinny jeans--feels like outright pandering. But hell its the fourth film and thats what happens when Hollywood hyperextends a simple paradigm beyond even the patience of the last cast and crew. (Greengrass just ""wasnt interested"" in another Bourne and without him Damon bailed.) Are we expecting much more?

Daily Edition Login to download The Bourne Legacy Film Review 900 AM PDT 8/6/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS The series legacy is lessened by this capable but uninspired fourth episode. TWITTER Jeremy Renner who takes over the franchises leading role from Matt Damon plays Aaron Cross a new off-the-grid Operation Outcome field agent. The Bourne legacy is furthered but not burnished by this fourth installment of the highly successful series that has heretofore been fronted by Matt Damon. With Jeremy Renner stepping in to play another covert operative and franchise screenwriter Tony Gilroy taking over the directorial reins from Paul Greengrass the same tone and look are maintained but the visceral excitement is muffled by familiarity an insufficiently conceived lead character and the sheer weight of backstory and multiple layers of deception. The box-office muscle of this final major name-brand attraction of the summer will be considerable but likely nowhere near the level of the most recent entry 2007s The Bourne Ultimatum which contributed 422 million of the 944 million the now decade-old Bourne series has generated in worldwide revenue. Gilroy who wrote this one with his brother Dan well knows his way around the inner workings of the series and the subterranean levels of secrecy and treachery that have made the late Robert Ludlums creation thrive onscreen for the past decade (this film bears no resemblance to the identically named 2004 novel authored by Eric Van Lustbader who has written six more in the series). THR COVER STORY Jeremy Renner 5 Million for Bourne Advice From Tom Cruise Brutally Honest About Fame Having proved his directorial acumen with Michael Clayton and Duplicity Gilroy starts things off promisingly with a rugged prologue that introduces a new off-the-grid Operation Outcome field agent Aaron Cross (Renner) completing a rigorous solo training mission in Alaska. Cross can climb jump shoot and anticipate as well as Bourne ever could and can manage at least two things his predecessor never did defeat a wolf in hand-to-hand and take down a drone that his superior CIA manager Eric Byer (Edward Norton) targets him with after learning that the entire program has been ""infected"" by the arrival in New York of Jason Bourne. The first section of The Bourne Legacy thus overlaps with the climax of the last film some footage of which is intercut with Cross remarkable survival of the drone attack and resourceful cover-up that makes Byer think the agent has died. Thereby able to move around for a while without being tracked Cross nonetheless needs critical meds only the government can provide which links his fate to a genetic scientist Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) who works with a few others in developing some extremely illicit drugs until a supposed deranged lunatic among them guns down all his co-workers except for Shearing who manages to hide. But we should know by now that theres a nasty ulterior motive behind almost every act of violence in a Bourne film and it is no different this time. PHOTOS Behind the Scenes of THRs Jeremy Renner Cover Shoot Cross too conveniently jumps into the good doctors life just as shes engaged in a tense interview about the murders with superiors at her home upon which they dash off as paired fugitives in the Hitchcock tradition with the twist that the panicky government pursuers only think theres of one of them. Gilroy has worked out the intricacies of the plot mechanics with a density that is thick as it is clever all of it once again designed to underline the utter mercilessness and amorality of the CIA and such fictional secret organizations as Treadstone and Operation Outcome; as the forever-agitated Byer states it ""We are morally indefensible and absolutely necessary."" This cynicism always has been at the cold heart of the series and the appeal was that Damons Bourne was always a match for it. At first in scenes in an Alaska cabin with a supposed contact (Oscar Isaac) that are laced with wariness it seems that Gilroy and Renner mean to make Aaron Cross into a naturally chatty inquisitive type in contrast to Bournes taciturn seriousness. This intention shows itself for a while longer once he gets to the East Coast but then it vanishes leaving Renner with little to play other than a cookie-cutter tough guy and action hero able to save the day many times over. ANALYSIS Jeremy Renners Mission to Become a Leading Man In his reputation-making roles in The Hurt Locker and The Town Renner displayed a volatile unpredictability that bore comparison to James Cagney. Since then with his far more manicured and better-tailored appearances in Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol The Avengers and now this he has seemed straitjacketed and tamped down as if having been advised not to come off as dangerous so as to be made fit for general consumption. Cross like Bourne should be dangerous and its not as if the character doesnt get to take down a bunch of spooks and assassins anxious for a major notch in their belts. But Gilroy has cheated his leading man out of a good part by providing scant backstory personality traits or motivation other than the most simplistic one of saving his own skin and that of his companion in rebellion against superiors who feel they need them erased. For her part Weisz has a few good scenes to play especially upon surviving the lab massacre and when facing down her inquisitors. The bad guys from Norton on down are terse self-serving and ruthless ""just do it"" types. VIDEO Bourne Legacy Trailer Jeremy Renner Fights for His Life in the Shadow of Jason Bourne At least as much as its predecessors this is a globe-trotting affair running from Alaska through Chicago New York D.C. and environs Seoul Karachi and ultimately Manila a relatively unfamiliar location in big features that is the scene for a long motorcycle chase that unfortunately features mostly familiar moves. With Gilroys regular cinematographer Robert Elswit behind the camera the film looks first-rate but the director backs down several notches from the radically amped-up approach to physicality established by Greengrass to diminished returns.

Jason Bourne is nowhere to be found in ""The Bourne Legacy."" Instead the villains storyline continues as ruthless government agencies try to decommission an entire line of Bourne-like super-soldiers but fail to eliminate one Aaron Cross an agent whose name is far punchier than his personality. Subbing character actor Jeremy Renner into a franchise that requires Matt Damon-caliber magnetism series scribe Tony Gilroy takes over the helming duties with an overlong sequel that features too little action and an unnecessarily complicated plot. Fans will come but they wont be happy as if paying for a Bond movie and getting a 002 adventure in return. After director Paul Greengrass walked away and Damon declined to reprise his most popular character the producers were left with a sizable challenge the sort creator Robert Ludlum clearly never faced in his novels. Rather than risk recasting the role the filmmakers tapped Gilroy (who had written all three prior installments) to create a fresh agent in Bournes image introducing Renners character with the tagline ""There was never just one."" But Gilroy is a different kind of director from Doug Liman and Greengrass less interested in explosions than in the mechanics of the bomb. Putting him in charge amplifies the backroom dealings (this time its Edward Norton running the show from a Virginia-based crisis suite) to the detriment of the scenes featuring the franchises new protagonist. Aaron Cross (Renner) belongs to a companion program Outcome similar to Bournes Treadstone except that its genetically modified operatives are controlled by means of two pills The blue capsules boost brain functioning while the green ones improve their physical performance. When the supply runs out the agents regress to their unmodified state a prospect unappealing enough that Cross trained to assassinate at the CIAs whim will kill to continue his dosage. To get more drugs Cross must locate Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) who barely survived a brutal workplace shooting in a scene that would be disturbing enough without Aurora Colo. still fresh in the mind. Theatrical line readings aside Shearing behaves realistically under pressure fighting off panic while Cross tries to protect her until the very end when the film gives her a chance to assert her own survival instinct. Though the espionage genre traditionally favors action Gilroy is clearly more of a blue-pill kind of guy having actively resisted standard spy-movie cliches since the series beginning. But the helmer pushes too far in the opposite direction here resisting an opening-scene adrenaline rush and supplying clues in stingy portions more likely to frustrate than to flatter auds intelligence. Indeed half an hour unspools before the action kicks in and longer than that before things start to make sense. Renner features throughout the first act but his hazy character has been dispatched to remote Alaska on an ambiguous training exercise. While Cross slogs through the snow Nortons cold-blooded power broker Eric Byer cleans up the mess exposed by Bourne whose one-man vendetta compromised not only not only Treadstone but Outcome as well. In ""The Bourne Identity"" the heros amnesia mirrored that pics way of dispensing information effectively putting auds in Bournes shoes. Repeated on a character with a functioning memory the approach feels like a tease as Gilroys script (co-written with brother Dan) not only withholds crucial exposition but wrongfully assumes that auds will automatically care about Bournes replacement. Renner comes across as less immediately compelling than Damon partly because it takes so long for the story to focus on Cross and though the actor portrays a man in turmoil the film fails to get inside his head. Outside photos of Bourne flash by on surveillance monitors or clipped to files suggesting that a more interesting film -- namely ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" -- is unfolding elsewhere at the same time. Series regulars Albert Finney Joan Allen and David Strathairn cycle by in the background but this installment is wedded to the fate of Outcome. An around-the-world montage introduces the programs five other agents whose mix of races and genders might have been intriguing had Byer not succeeded in snuffing them out so quickly. These assassins typically work alone which makes for a tense meeting when Cross encounters his first fellow Outcome agent (Oscar Isaac). Unlike Bourne Cross knows what he is and can fairly deduce who might be trying to kill him but his top priority is finding a way to ""viral out"" relying on Shearing to administer the serum that will make his enhancements permanent. To do so they must travel to Manila where ""The Bourne Legacy"" finally decides to become a Bourne movie clumsily trying to squeeze as much action into the final reel as possible. If the filmmakers hope to carry on with Cross they will have to rethink what auds expect from the character offering more confrontation and less conspiracy. Gilroy reassembles much of his ""Michael Clayton"" team relying on composer James Newton Howard to help goose the energy. The combination of Robert Elswits elegant widescreen lensing and the measured editing by Gilroys brother John may be easier to absorb than Greengrass hyperkinetic docu-based style but the pics convoluted script ensures that auds will emerge no less overwhelmed.
