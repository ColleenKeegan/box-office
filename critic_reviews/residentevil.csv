Romero in his ""Living Dead"" trilogy -- gets a malnourished rebirth in ""Resident Evil"" the long-in-development screen adaptation of the hugely popular videogame franchise. That venerable horror subgenre the zombie movie -- immortalized by George A. Romero in his ""Living Dead"" trilogy -- gets a malnourished rebirth in ""Resident Evil"" the long-in-development screen adaptation of the hugely popular videogame franchise. (To date there have been three game sequels action figures and a series of books.) Despite a promising setup pic never really goes anywhere instead immersing viewers in a kinetic onslaught of flesh (namely that of Milla Jovovich) and flesh-eaters (most of the rest of the cast). Games fervent fans have created a groundswell of anticipation for pic which may lead to respectable openings Stateside and abroad but video looks to follow quickly for this undead retread. Co-written and directed by the young British director Paul Anderson (who apparently to avoid confusion with Paul Thomas Anderson now calls himself Paul W.S. Anderson) German-shot and financed pic works as a prequel to the games although it uses many of the games popular zombie characters (with such indelible names as the Licker the Crows and the Zombie Dogs). Short prologue is set inside the sprawling underground research labs of Umbrella Corp. known as the Hive. Umbrella appears to be an all-purpose household company but is actually the front for a top-secret military technology and genetic experimentation operation. (Its a subject fit for Romero and he did write the first script and had been set to direct.) Anderson (who directed the videogame adaptation ""Mortal Kombat"") maps out the Hives infrastructure satirizing the security paranoia. The Hives security is regulated by an artificially intelligent computer called the Red Queen (one of a series of Lewis Carroll allusions); 10 minutes in the Red Queen locks down the Hive and begins a series of defensive measures (including releasing poisonous gas into densely populated workspaces). A deadly virus was released into the Hives ventilation system and the Red Queen who behaves like a menstruating Hal 9000 will do anything ANYTHING to keep it contained. Enter some soldiers including One (Colin Salmon) and Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) dispatched to shut the Red Queen down. Theyre accompanied by Alice (Jovovich) a soldier with a temporary memory loss and by Matt (Eric Mabius) who claims to be a cop. They shut the Red Queen down but in doing so the Hives passageways are unlocked giving free reign to hundreds of contaminated workers who as a result of their exposure to the virus are now very undead. The manic zombie mayhem that ensues -- unfolding ""High Noon""-style in real time -- is in many ways a scene-for-scene copy of Romeros 1985 ""Day of the Dead."" But unlike Romero Anderson fails to situate ""Resident Evil"" zombies within any larger social context. Andersons script lines up all the elements for a B-movie quickie the multiethnic cast the chicks who kick ass and the traitor-in-our-midst scenario. But Anderson is too set on making an A-picture here focusing on a series of exhaustingly routine big-action set pieces. Like the recent ""Queen of the Damned"" ""Resident Evil"" seems conceived more out of a desire to provide lip service to fans of the underlying source material than to make compelling entertainment. Andersons zombie shenanigans are as empty as ""Queen of the Damneds"" vampire theatrics. Nonetheless Andersons surface effects are occasionally admirable. Pic relies more on prosthetic makeup and animatronic f/x than on digital technology giving pics zombies and other assorted monsters a more organic sense of form and movement. And there are times where ""Resident Evil"" cant help being funny as when Jovovich slo-mo drop-kicks a rabid zombie Doberman. Jovovich is the big surprise here. Her Alice is hardly the plum part Sigourney Weaver had in the ""Alien"" films but Jovovich convinces you that she could pull off a Weaveresque turn if given the raw materials and Andersons camera caresses her every athletic-balletic movement. Pic is reasonably accomplished technically though Richard Bridglands production design is standard-issue futuristic grunge recalling similar futurescapes from Andersons own ""Soldier"" and ""Event Horizon"" as well as last summers ""John Carpenters Ghosts of Mars.""

It looks good but scary it aint especially when it focuses on the Hive a vast underground bio-engineering works where a dubious conglomerate has been dabbling with an anti-ageing compound. When a saboteur breaks in and releases the virus all hell breaks loose. But what about the employees trapped below? Its left to a small team of commandos to penetrate the Alien-style complex. Hats off however to the production team for the set designs and one very imaginative death-by-laser sequence. The rest is a derivative tedious mess.

"USATODAY.com - Resident Evil looks a lot like its better predecessors Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/14/2002 - Updated 1012 PM ET Resident Evil looks a lot like its better predecessors By Mike Clark USA TODAY Resident Evil (out of four) Stars Milla Jovovich Michelle Rodriguez Eric Mabius James Purefoy Director Paul W.S. Anderson Distributor Screen Gems Rating R for sci-fi/horror violence language and brief sexuality/nudity And you thought Enron had skeletons? In Resident Evil flesh-nibbling former humans roam the basement of a huge corporation that has virally infected them. Worse director Paul W.S. Anderson isnt immune to pilfering concepts or shots from Aliens Forbidden Planet George A. Romeros Living Dead epics The Relic and even his own Event Horizon while screen-adapting a video game franchise. Evils one strong presence is lead Milla Jovovich -- and not because the script gives her supercop/soldier anything interesting to say. Read more below Video Watch the Resident Evil trailer Related Stories Video games get the reel treatment More video games will leap to film Its just that the enraged look she gets in her eyes makes her convincing when shes strangling a bottom-floor undead creature between her thighs or flexing Matrix-like moves (more movie pilfering). You almost want to have some guy say ""Youre kinda cute when youre sadistic"" so you can see her rip his head off. The rest is your everyday movie about a corporation whose research lab accidentally releases a deadly virus forcing its main computer to shut off the facility and trap everyone inside -- along with bloodthirsty mutant dogs. Now full of employee-zombies the companys passageways provide a challenge-a-minute to pros sent to clean up Jovovich a lockjawed male (Eric Mabius) who seems vaguely untrustworthy and a second woman. Shes played by Michelle Rodriguez from The Fast and the Furious and Girlfight so you know not to mess with her. Evil begins promisingly sags for 75 minutes then rallies a little at the end. But an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus. If only there were one for this kind of movie. Though it has enough ka-pow to do initial business the movie cant top the fact that its cinematographer David Johnson also shot Hilary and Jackie (which got two acting Oscar nominations) and that its art director Richard Bridgland worked on Ian McKellens splashy-looking Richard III. Oh the evil that men (or at least video games) do.

Milla Jovovich as Alice in Resident Evil. Photo HANDOUT FILM CLIPS / Also opening this week 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Resident Evil Action/sci-fi. Starring Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez . Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson . (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To adapt a movie from a novel involves a process of subtraction and consolidation. To make one from a video game is all about expansion -- or else the result is something almost unwatchable like last years ""Tomb Raider."" ""Resident Evil"" is the first movie based on a video game that seems inspired by more than a desire to sell tickets to a pre-existing market. The film works within the rules of the game taking place mainly in a single setting and piling on a relentless barrage of action sequences. But theres a psychological undercurrent. The movie occupies a zone where science fiction and nightmares collide and intertwine. Milla Jovovich plays a young lady who wakes up one morning on the floor of her shower remembering nothing about her life to that moment. The house is quiet but the air is electric with menace. Next thing hooded commandos are crashing through her windows -- including the always spunky Michelle Rodriguez. They take her on their mission to an underground city called ""The Hive"" to deactivate an all-powerful computer that has just gone homicidal and killed all its employees. Thats the premise. The group has to get in and get out. Along the way the computer throws everything it can at them including a laser weapon that both slices people and cauterizes wounds thus eliminating the mess from massacres. There are killer zombies and a generic all-powerful devouring fiend. What keeps it from getting ridiculous is the sense that this is all in some way analogous to the process the heroine is undergoing throughout the movie She is recovering her memory. The action in ""Resident Evil"" is like watching demons from the repressed unconscious break loose and attack the ego. The movie also makes a further point that the science nightmare of the future is a manifestation of that unconscious impulse for self-destruction loose and invisible throughout the world. Evil is residing within. Advisory This film contains violence and brief nudity. -- Mick LaSalle JUNG IN THE LAND OF THE MUJAHEDDIN Documentary. Directed by Fabrizio Lazzaretti and Alberto Vendemmiati. (Not rated. 109 minutes. In English and in Italian with English subtitles. At the Roxie.) Amother brushing flies from her starving childs face. Kids with missing arms or legs. Mutilated corpses. No one who sees ""Jung In the Land of the Mujaheddin"" will be able to forget it and few who see it will be sorry. Sometimes being humane means not being squeamish. This is an Italian documentary about an old journalist an Italian surgeon and an English nurse who travel to Afghanistan to set up a medical facility. In the process the film -- completed a year before the Sept. 11 attacks -- documents the sufferings of a people plagued by 20 years of land mines poverty and unending war. After seeing this no one should be surprised at the enthusiasm with which the Afghan people greeted the recent collapse of the Taliban. ""Jung"" records horror stories of men and women being beaten by the Taliban and of precious goods being confiscated. The poverty and despair are heartbreaking. One young woman letting her hair down in Northern Alliance territory says that she covers herself only out of fear of the Taliban but that in any other country shed never wear a burqa. ""What would I do with a tent over my head?"" she says. The films hero is Dr. Gino Strada who always looks as though hes just rolled out of bed. This gruff no-nonsense man turns out to be in practice a kind of saint working around the clock and against the odds to bring health care into a hopeless situation. Being a saint is not an ethereal calling but a hands-on job. In one scene Strada operates on a man who has shrapnel in his eye. In another Strada is forced to amputate a young mans foot using a primitive saw. On several occasions the camera is turned on Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud who was assassinated two days before the World Trade Center bombings. In a country with some wild-eyed leaders Massoud comes across as compassionate and rational. A couple of months ago the narrative film ""Kandahar"" played here and was praised to the skies but after seeing ""Jung"" ""Kandahar"" seems like a fairy tale. Those who can take it will find ""Jung"" the real deal. Advisory This film contains violence and gore. -- Mick LaSalle THE MOST FERTILE MAN IN IRELAND Comedy. Starring Kris Marshall. Directed by Dudi Appleton. (Not rated. 92 minutes. At the Rafael Film Center). ""The Most Fertile Man in Ireland"" starts with the premise that the Irish have trouble procreating. Then things really get ridiculous and not in a funny way. Despite its wannabe-John Waters Day-Glo colors and odd camera angles the movie never achieves camp. Attempted farce mixes with raunch politics and religion missing the mark on every front. More steady of aim is Belfast lad Eamonn (Kris Marshall) whose little guys can break through any latex fortress. He decides to earn some cash as a Johnny Appleseed for childless couples making his deliveries the old-fashioned way. If you follow this movies logic hes bedding married women because the Catholic and Protestant churches forbid artificial insemination. Adultery apparently isnt as frowned upon because Eamonns priest gives him the thumbs up. This stuff might have been funny if ""The Most Fertile Man"" were an effective farce but the movie rarely elicits a grin. When Eamonns sterile friend threatens him with a gun and then says ""Theyre just blanks anyway"" thats as good as it gets. Marshall often bugs his eyes as if he were about to burst. Though his mannerisms are distracting every show of enthusiasm is welcome in this listless venture. The movie collapses when it makes fun of ""The Troubles"" of Northern Ireland alternating photos of Queen Elizabeth and the pope to signal Eamonns visits to Protestant and Catholic homes. To wrest comedy from a tragic situation the humor has to be extremely sharp or extremely dark. Here the jokes arent pointed enough to even offend anybody. Advisory This film contains explicit sexuality raw language. -- Carla Meyer Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

There must now be an entire generation that has never experienced George A. Romeros ""Living Dead"" films with their flesh-munching ghouls and frenzied atmosphere of rabid hyped-up paranoia. ""Resident Evil"" is a blatant recycling of those queasy pulp classics notably ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1979) with its claustrophobic setting its comic-book sociology and its SWAT-team-on-the-defense ballistics. The film starts out looking like a timely exercise in biohazard panic as a group of masked commandos breaks into the Hive a vast underground genetic research facility run by a meta-conglomerate called the Umbrella Corporation. Theres one nifty sequence inspired by the 1998 Canadian film ""Cube"" in which two men get trapped in a corridor patrolled by a deadly geometric slice-and-dice laser. But thats all window dressing as ""Resident Evil"" turns into a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it. The director Paul W.S. Anderson made a nifty little outer-space chiller called ""Event Horizon"" a few years ago but this time working with a cast that features the girls-with-guns team of Milla Jovovich (not bad) and Michelle Rodriguez (all one-note pout) he shoots the works complete with demon Dobermans zombies that pop up like fun-house skeletons a token ""Matrix"" fly-kick or two and a bullwhip-tongued skinless giant that leaps and slithers like ""Alien.""
