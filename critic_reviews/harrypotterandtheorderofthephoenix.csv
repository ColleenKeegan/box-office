It isnt that the film is bad; its predictableA,A little dramas may seem gripping and full of twists if youre in the under-six age group the picturesA,A looks nice and the kids are polite and spirited. I suspect they all have excellent bathing habits and solid dental hygiene. But with the addition of Imelda Staunton as Prof. Dolores Umbrage who comes in to run a one-woman anti-fun Inquisition at Hogwarts there are now officially more bad guysA,A than there are members of the New England Patriots. TheA,A parade ofA,A subsidiary characters cant do anything to disguise the stasis of a drawn-out story that is just killing time until the final battle betweenA,A the plucky Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) andA,A the noseless Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) which is still two movies off. At a climactic moment in this film which is the shortest of the series butA,A the most sluggish Harry discovers a surprise prophecy that says that neither he nor Voldemort canA,A survive while the other lives. Wait you mean the bad guy actually has to be defeated by the good guy or vice versa?A,A It took 12 hours worth of the various movies to get us here?A,A The only list ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix""A,A is going to top is the rundown of the years top Rupert Grint films. If youve seen any other Harry PotterA,A movie youve seen this one. The foster family is mean to himA,A Harry is unjustly accused of troublemaking by authorities theres someA,A scary magic where the kids point their wands at stuff in the dark and comedy magic where the kids point wands and make bunnies andA,A dogsA,A appear.A,A  The film tells us the legend ofA,A the Order of the Phoenix which is an association of the previous generation of magicians whose example Harry hopes to live up to but it couldnt be duller if it wereA,A the Order of the Sacramento. In the book version of ""Phoenix""A,A Harry was supposedly becoming more complex and moody but in the movie hes the same old dull-as-a-student-council-presidentA,A Harry though he occasionally loses his temper (inA,A a mild Beaver Cleaver way) because he isA,A being blamed for the death of his friend Cedric and called a liar for saying the evil Voldemort has returned from the dead he is as usual completely in the right so it will take the whole movie for the others to acknowledge what we know going in. In the beginning of the movie Harry is expelled from school but since weve seen why (he used a spell off school grounds which isA,A against the rules but onlyA,A to save the lives of himself and his cousin Dudley which makes it okay) and since we know Harry is not goingA,A to leave Hogwarts to become a carny or take a job sweeping floors at Arbys its a yawn to watch him undergo accusation and reinstatement. There is some mild interest in the way Voldemort attacks Harry psychologically by invading his thoughts but there was something a tad familiar in the way this all-powerful villain tries to seduceA,A the young orphan into ignoringA,A good things andA,A stepping onA,A over to the Dark Side.A,A  And anA,A opportunity is lost when Hogwarts becomes corrupted by evil via the influence of the Ministry that controls it. Instead of this being a mystery that the characters tease out were simply told it has happened and then we watch many many examples Prof. Umbrage nailing her nasty prohibitions againstA,A pleasure on every flat surfaceA,A and demanding that students rat each other out. For about an hour.A,A The pleasure of the books is I suppose is in itsA,A menagerie of wonderfulA,A  characters. But in a 138-minute movie there isnt space to develop more than seven or eight personalities. Here is a partial list of just the figures who exist to provide Harry counsel friendshipA,A and support Ron Hermione Hagrid Dumbledore Mad-Eye Moody Sirius Black Snape Prof. McGonagall Lupin Mrs. Weasley etc. etc. etc. If youve read the books you may look on allA,A of these people as old friends. But on film someA,A are reduced to giving fly-by performances; a tip of the broomstick and theyre gone.A,A  Bend over to take a sip of your Pepsi and youll miss appearances by three or four Oscar winners. There are soA,A many characters to squeeze in that Harry gets to have aA,A love interest Cho Chang for exactly one scene. The rest of theA,A  movie Cho loiters in the background doing nothing except for the last third whenA,A she is forgotten entirely. And were so overstocked with villains that Helena Bonham Carter as the evil escaped prisoner Bellatrix LeStrange appears about 85 percent of the way through the movie cackles briefly and is done a couple of minutes later. IfA,A youve got Darth Vader give the audience Darth Vader not Darth Vaders assistants assistants intern. But Volde-vader  as he did in the last film pops up only for a couple of minutes then wanders away which is exactly what you knew was going to happen and exactly what I wanted to do also.

Until then fans will have to settle for the appropriately bleak -- if fragmented and perfunctory -- movie version of book five with 14-year-old Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) a wizard at odds with his world (though he does manage to snag his first kiss). ENLARGE This includes the staunchly conservative Ministry of Magic the wizards governing body which almost expels Harry from Hogwarts boarding school for a supposed infraction and the wizarding-world rag ""The Daily Prophet"" which scoffs at Harrys story of a recent encounter with evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). This also includes a sadistic new teacher (Imelda Staunton) whos got a bead on Harry and myriad classmates who pooh-pooh his belief that the dark forces are regaining strength. Even Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) Harrys longtime protector and mentor has become mysteriously distant. His boon companions Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) his fey new friend Luna (the wonderful Evanna Lynch) and godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) offer some succor. Still this is increasingly the portrait of a wizard as an alienated young man. The movies palette almost limited to gray and black adds to the sense of unease and foreboding. Director David Yates who is new to the Potter franchise moves the story along briskly at the expense of texture and nuance. In any case despite its title the movie belongs to Ms. Staunton as the poisonous-in-pink Dolores Umbridge a fascistic functionary from the Ministry of Magic who becomes acting head of Hogwarts and who likes children just exactly the way W.C. Fields did -- fried. Talk to Me Watching ""Talk to Me"" its difficult not to wonder what its subject Ralph Waldo ""Petey"" Greene Jr. would make of the proceedings. Greene a former convict who became a hugely popular radio personality a community activist and a hero in the Washington D.C. black community during the late 60s and early 70s was known for his endless insistence on ""telling it like it is."" This stance would require an admission that however well-intentioned however sedulously it touches all the bio-pic bases and honors certain basic bio-pic tropes (changing times and attitudes are signified by alterations in coiffures and in characters accumulation of facial hair) ""Talk to Me"" rarely rises above the dutiful. In all instances the lift is supplied by the wonderful Don Cheadle as Petey. Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor) the very strait-laced program director at radio station WOL-AM is visiting his brother in prison when he meets the intense importunate Greene whos doing time for armed robbery and who boasts of his dj-ing prowess. As hell say later its the only job he can do without breaking the law. Dewey contemptuously -- carelessly -- tells Greene to come and see him when hes out of the clink never dreaming Greene will do exactly that. When Petey shows up -- ""Im here to work in this funky joint"" -- hes summarily shown the door. But confronted by a sharp drop in ratings for the morning drive-time broadcast Dewey convinces the dubious station head (Martin Sheen in a thankless role) to give Petey a chance. His first stint in the booth is almost his last; his second brings out the police. But the phone lines start lighting up like Christmas trees and Dewey becomes convinced that Peteys fresh mouth is a breath of fresh air. While nominally a snapshot of a fraught period in the countrys history -- just before and after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. -- ""Talk to Me"" is at bottom the story of the relationship between Dewey and Petey; its a collision course given the vast differences in their temperaments and dreams. But those differences however genuine are exploited to give the film a tension it wouldnt otherwise have. For a movie that celebrates the power of speech ""Talk to Me"" is oddly tongue tied. Its dialogue equal parts uptight honky and jumping jive seems particularly in the early stretches to have been generated by a computer. Interview They may not be willing to cop to it but journalists know that an interview is as much as anything a seduction You show me yours Ill show you mine. That is to say Ill pretend to show you mine. But whos seducing who? Thats the signal concern of the diverting if ultimately inconsequential ""Interview"" based on the film of the same name by Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh (who was murdered in 2004 by a Muslim extremist). Steve Buscemi directed and co-wrote this adaptation which could just as easily be called ""Sex Lies and Videotape."" He also plays Pierre a political and war reporter who is none too pleased with his current assignment a profile of Katya (the ravishing Sienna Miller) a blond starlet whose movies -- the latest is ""Killer Body Parts IV"" -- hes never seen whose hit TV show hes never watched and whose I.Q you know hes thinking compares unfavorably with her bust measurement. Katya shows up an hour late at the designated meeting place a restaurant of the moment where Buscemi as filmmaker wonderfully exposes a celebritys hollow efforts to establish ""Im just like you"" bona fides. The interview lets just say does not go well. Katyas amour propre is abraded by Pierres lack of preparedness. Pierre makes no secret of his boredom and his desire to be gone. Taxi But Katya indirectly responsible when Pierre gets a bit dinged in a traffic accident invites him to her loft to dress the wound and redress the wrongs of their previous encounter. ""You can ask me anything. Anything at all"" she says. Hmmmm. Over the course of the evening the two drink and talk engage in sexual sparring and lay bare what they claim to be their darkest secrets. Comic relief is provided by the dog-bark ring tone of Katyas cell phone. Both in its content and production values ""Interview"" has the feel of an undergraduate project -- all intensity no never mind. Pierre is such a weasel Katya is such a narcissist and the outcome seems so pre-determined its hard to care whose belt gets the notch. The adroit performances of Buscemi and Miller almost make it matter.    DVD TIP A bespectacled 11-year-old (Daniel Radcliffe) learns the truth -- hes a great and powerful wizard -- in the movie that began it all the over-reverent but richly detailed ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" (2001). Joe Morgenstern is on vacation.

Scads of Harry Potter fans and pop-culture mavens speculate on the heros demise in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows"" (the conclusion of J.K. Rowlings series in stores July 21) even as moviegoers anticipate time well spent with Harry Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" Of course the Potter books and films have never been short on loss. And death sniffs and snaps around Harry and the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry even as Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge confounds matters by hounding Harry and denying the return of Lord Voldemort. As director David Yates well-done addition to the consistently fine franchise begins the teen wizard has seldom looked more forlorn. Poor Harry James Potter. Portrayed since boyhood by Daniel Radcliffe the teenager is too big for the playground swing he sits on in the Muggle burg where the Dursleys - Harrys aunt uncle and their idiot spawn Dudley - live their unexamined lives. During year four of his studies covered in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" Harry experienced the momentous. There was his first infatuation. (Here hell land his first kiss a lovely scene of yearning and chastity.) There was also the death of a much-admired classmate and an all- out confrontation with He Who Increasingly Shant Go Nameless. Harry mopes through the purgatory of summer break. He hasnt heard a peep from Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) or his champion Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). His shirt gathers taut around the chest and biceps. His jaw is finding a keener line. But those owlish glasses still protect Harrys hard-to- read face. Does that brooding look on his-half wizard-half Muggle mug speak of adolescent doldrums or something darker? The answer to this query resounds even more emphatically than it did in the magical menacing ""Goblet of Fire."" Yes Yes Both. Arguably its Harrys betwixt-and-between birthright that makes him such a powerful and vulnerable hero especially in Rowlings books. Though truth be told its the lads many onscreen allies that prove the film franchises richest draws. (Thank you Alan Rickman for your wonderfully embittered turn as Severus Snape.) The proximity of the Muggle world to the realm of magic is pronounced here. When Harry is rescued by Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) they broom-zoom above the Thames to a clandestine meeting of the Order of the Phoenix a group instituted by Dumbledore. If the Muggle life seems threatening it never truly frightens. Thats reserved for beings like the Dementors. When Harry wields his wand in defense of Dudley and himself hes hauled in front of a tribunal led by Fudge. Harry avoids being blacklisted but hes more outcast than ever. Hes also more prickly. The burdens of loss and soldiering on weigh heavy on this film that Michael Goldenberg has adapted. Ethereal yet oh-so-centered Luna Lovegood (welcome newcomer Evanna Lynch) makes friends with intriguing beasts that ""can only be seen by people who have seen death."" Even the quasi-comic relief has a foreboding edge. Imelda Staunton portrays Professor Dolores Umbridge Hogwarts Fudge-appointed Defense Against Dark Arts bureaucrat. Her false yip of a laugh betrays a nasty pleasure. Her pink fuzzy get-ups cant camouflage the heart of a torturer. Thank goodness for the unbridled naughtiness of the Weasley twins older brothers Fred and George. The red- haired teens operate without rules. In an ever glummer world they provide fireworks. As Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his ilk gather strength Harry asks godfather Sirius Black if war is imminent. Gary Oldman infuses Sirius with such melancholy ache that you find yourself hoping for a prequel. ""It feels like it did before"" he replies. What restrained poetry - Potters world at its best. An affirmative answer would leave little room for possibility. A negative one would merely be the utterance of an adult trying to con a kid into hope when honesty must do.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor July 12 2007 Save for later Saved If you are a Pottermaniac this is the month for you. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" opens today and on July 21 the seventh and final Potter tome lands with a thud at your local bookstore.Since the new movie is based on book No. 5 one wonders whether the reputedly dark book No. 7 will cast a pall over movie No. 6. On the other hand if its darkness youre looking for ""Order of the Phoenix"" is the perfect pall. Unlike the other movies which owned their share of the dark side ""Order of the Phoenix"" downplays the festive classmate hubbub at Hogwarts in favor of a decidedly more sinister tone. This means no Quidditch matches.Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) returned at the end of the last film ""Goblet of Fire"" and so the stakes are considerably higher for Harry who dodges repeated attempts on his life and perhaps even scarier has his first kiss. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Since Harry Hermione and Ron are still being played by the same actors - Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson and Rupert Grint respectively - the series has its own built-in subtext We are watching children grow into adolescents. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 A case could be made that the series is one long encoded adolescent rite of passage with all the authority-defying hormone-raging storminess that comes with the territory. As in many a teenage fantasy it is the young people who must teach their doddering elders the score. Specifically Harry must convince the wizards that he really did encounter Voldemort and then leading his secret band of students do battle with the bad guy.The film begins at the close of summer as Harry awaits his fifth year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Because he illegally used magic outside school Harry is in danger of being expelled. Although headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) intervenes in what amounts to a kangaroo court engineered by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) Harry is beset by nightmares.His battle training is hampered by the fact that a new Dark Arts teacher has been installed at Hogwarts Professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) whose Ministry-approved curriculum is woefully inadequate to the task. Umbridge is a marvelous addition to the series. Short and squat clad in pink from head to toe the aptly named Umbridge is a ferocious authoritarian who smiles and smiles - the worst kind. In a nice touch her pink outfits get progressively darker. By the end shes swathed in cerise.Director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg both new to the series have trimmed J. K. Rowlingss 870-page novel into a fairly well-paced 139 minutes - the shortest film in the series though not the best. That honor goes to Alfonso Cuarons ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" with Mike Newells ""Goblet of Fire"" a respectable runner-up.Cuaron more than any of the other directors drew out the lyricism and terror and the great good humor of the books. Yates especially given the sinister subject matter on hand does a rather workmanlike job of traffic-managing the action. But some of the magic effects are indeed magical including a sequence featuring eerily white centaur-like creatures who can be perceived only by those who have looked upon death.And although many of the regulars including Hermione Ron and Alan Rickmans Professor Snape are unaccountably skimped Harry comes through loud and clear as a conflicted edgy avid young man. Hes turned into EveryTeen.Radcliffe who received good reviews as the lead in ""Equus"" on the London stage during his downtime away from the series actually gives a performance this time around. He doesnt just have the Harry Potter look - hes grown into the character. This may not be the most alluring reason to check out ""Order of the Phoenix"" but given what lies in store for Harry it bodes well. Grade B Rated PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images. Next up Chapter amp; Verse Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Will David Yates direct? Chapter amp; Verse J.K. Rowling reveals past source of inspiration for Harry Potter character Dolores Umbridge Chapter amp; Verse J.K. Rowling will release a new piece about a Harry Potter character. Who is it?

By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  click the arrow button on the player below You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Daniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Theres nary a Quidditch match to be found in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Warner Bros.) the fifth and antepenultimate installment in the series based on J.K. Rowlings monster-selling fantasy novels. What with the now-15-year-old Harrys boiling hormones and sullen demeanor not to mention a possible return of the noseless world-destroyer Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) the mood around Hogwarts is far too grim and the stakes of the impending battle too high to lighten things up with a game of broomstick polo. The Order of the Phoenix book did find time amid all the existential gloom to throw in a Quidditch match and a rollicking one at that. But the notion of faithfulness to the source material changes a bit when your source is 870 pages long. Phoenix is the longest of the Harry Potter books so far while the movie version is the shortest of the movies at two hours and 18 minutes. The director David Yates best known for his fine work in British television is no Alfonso Cuaron (who made Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban such an enthralling head rush) but he does an elegant job of rolling out this exposition-heavy middle chapter of the saga. With a plot dominated by political infighting at the Ministry of Magic Order of the Phoenix could easily have been as dull as one of those Star Wars prequels a CGI-enhanced version of congressional coverage on C-SPAN. Instead the movie is brisk and lively if not exactly action-packed. Advertisement The most arresting special effect in the Harry Potter film franchise has been one that requires no technology at all watching Daniel Radcliffe grow from a round-faced owl-eyed 10-year-old to the rangy high-strung young man hes become. Radcliffe is a notoriously serious and hardworking actor--in his spare time between Potter movies hes not clubbing with Lindsay Lohan but appearing as the tormented lead in the West End production of Equus. At times that work ethic gets in his way here He projects Harrys teen angst with a somber earnestness thats occasionally strained. But that seriousness can also work on the characters behalf. Harry Potter isnt Ferris Bueller; hes a tough and lonely orphan whos had to figure out early that growing up is no ride on a Nimbus 2000. Any fan of the books knows the story already and I dont want to ruin it for those that dont but briefly In Harry and his pals fifth year at Hogwarts the stalwart headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is in the process of being overthrown by Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) a Ministry-appointed prig who wants to whip the students into shape for their upcoming wizardry exams the OWLs. Her blind allegiance to standardized testing not to mention her relentless chipping away at civil liberties recall a certain U.S. president but the analogy is never overplayed. Sublimely outfitted with fuzzy pink suits and an impressive collection of decorative kitten plates Dolores Umbridge is an inspired villainess and Staunton has the time of her life in the role. The whole Hogwarts faculty is so beautifully cast it reinforces the American impression that in Britain great actors must be piled up on the side of the road in heaps. David Thewlis Maggie Smith Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are all superb even if they all get a frustratingly short time on-screen this go-round. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint playing Harrys loyal friends Hermione and Ron inhabit their roles as comfortably by now as old vaudevillians. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. While Umbridge pursues her no-wizard-left-behind policy of educational reform trouble of a more metaphysical nature is brewing. The enemy of all good wizards He Who Must Not Be Named (but who is now more or less casually referred to as Lord Voldemort) has begun amassing his army of Death Eaters for a fresh assault. A prophecy predicts that Harry will one day have to face the Dark Lord one-on-one (hence the nail-biting about the last book in the series due July 21). In the meantime there are still plenty of satisfying smackdowns to be had The one between Dumbledore and Voldemort at the end of this film is visually arresting even if magic battles with all their wand-waving and spell-saying work better on paper than on film. As in all the Potter movies so far the production design (here by Stuart Craig who worked on two of the previous films) is beyond genius from the living paintings to the Deco-on-drugs Ministry corridors to the town houses that split in half to reveal hidden buildings inside. And the Hogwarts school densely imagined and lovingly created from the ground up is one of the great examples of movie architecture up there with Kanes Xanadu and the Bates Motel. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix pulls off a feat that would have been impossible in my own adolescence I left it dying for school to start again.

Rowlings beloved series. Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Harry Potter Movies Entertainment News The worst thing you can do when facing the latest installment in the Harry Potter movie franchise is to yearn for the same kind of sturdy poetry J.K. Rowling has given us in the books theyre based on. Which isnt to say that we havent sometimes gotten it Alfonso Cuarons dreamily naturalistic 2004 ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" and Mike Newells moody pastoral 2005 ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" were better movies than we could have hoped for pictures that easily captured the spirit of the books they were based on. They made the first two pictures in the series ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" and ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" both of which were occasionally earnest but mostly dizzy and garish -- and both directed by Chris Columbus -- seem like distant easily erased memories. The fifth movie David Yates ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" may present the trickiest case of all This is a gangly confusing sprawl and yet there are enough patches of beauty scattered throughout that its impossible to reject it wholesale. Watching the thing I couldnt help feeling a pang of sympathy for Yates and his screenwriter Michael Goldenberg ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" at nearly 900 pages is the longest of Rowlings books and streamlining its pleasurably meandering Dickensian quality couldnt have been easy. Structurally the picture is jerky and episodic a jumble of events connected by tenuous threads; after seeing it those who havent read the book might be inspired to do so just so they can be sure of what really happened. But whatever the overarching problems with ""The Order of the Phoenix"" may be many of its scenes are beautifully directed. Yates may be one of those directors who -- for now at least -- is better suited to working on a small scale rather than undertaking a massive fantasy epic especially one with such high expectations attached to it. His previous credits include the 2005 HBO movie ""The Girl in the Cafe"" a quiet thoughtful little picture starring Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald and Yates brings a similarly delicate touch to this picture as well. Even the movies grand climax -- an operatic unnerving sequence -- includes some lovely special effects that could be viewed as a visual meditation on the nature of glass and of the universe. As ""The Order of the Phoenix"" begins Harry has endured yet another dreadful summer at the home of his guardians the Dursleys (once again played by Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths). As always hes counting the days until he can return to Hogwarts -- this will be his fifth year. But this summer has been particularly difficult He hasnt heard from his closest friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and the sting of that is intensified by the fact that at the end of the previous school year hed survived a horrifying confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) which resulted in the death of a fellow student. Harry is sullen and dejected; he feels he deserves more sympathy than hes getting. Worse yet just before the school year is to begin Harry is hauled into court for practicing magic in the Muggle world As a defensive measure hed summoned his patronus (a powerful and protective spirit creature particular to each witch or wizard) to dispatch a pack of Dementors whod threatened to suck the spirit from his fat lazy cousin Dudley (Harry Melling). The Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) wants to see Harry expelled; he also refuses to believe that the long-exiled Voldemort is really set to return. Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) comes to Harrys defense but is also strangely distant with him which further increases Harrys feelings of confusion and isolation. Harry does get back into Hogwarts but that early stumbling block is only the beginning of his trials. The biggest danger comes in the form of a beaming nonsense-spouting little fireplug dressed in a series of pink boucle Queen Mum-style outfits The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) not only refuses to provide her charges with usable practical information which inherently puts them in danger; she has also been installed to keep Harry in line and to curb his outspokenness. To that end she drags him into detention during which he must scratch out on a piece of paper with an inkless pen the line ""I will not tell lies."" The words appear not on the paper but etched into his skin his own blood seeping through the curlicued cursive wounds of his own careful penmanship. You Might Also Like ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" riffed on the bittersweetness of leaving childhood behind; ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a punk shout a reflection of teenage rebellion and frustration. The finest moments of ""The Order of the Phoenix"" are the ones in which Harry and his friends and fellow students band together to help themselves -- to reject the complacent ideals of the establishment as theyre reflected in the mincing insidious Dolores Umbridge and to jump-start their own world -- their own adult lives -- by harnessing the energy and idealism of youth. Yates grasps the countercultural vibe of Rowlings book and as she does he makes sure it feels modern and vital instead of like some musty fantasy imitation of Woodstock. Led by Harry the students gather surreptitiously to try to summon their own patronuses -- or should that be patroni? -- and after many false starts some of them do. One of the most wonderful new characters a nearly translucent white-haired waif named Luna Lovegood (shes played with eerie sure-footedness by Evanna Lynch) delights when a prancing rabbit made of sparks of light leaps from her wand. The sequence is beautifully shaped dazzling and alive. Yates clearly has a knack for working with actors He stages Harrys first kiss (the girl is Cho played by Katie Leung whom Harry has long had a crush on) very delicately and without a whiff of sentimentality. Later Yates brings that same casual touch to a scene in which Harry tries to describe the kiss to Ron and Hermione only to find that words cant touch it. Hermione attempts to explain the rush of emotions that Cho must have felt -- all intensified by the fact that her boyfriend Cedric was killed the previous year -- while Ron listens slack-jawed and replies in a moment that captures perfectly the cluelessness of young males of the species ""One person couldnt feel all that"" The young actors here are by now so comfortable in their roles that they could practically sleepwalk through them. Thankfully they dont One of the pleasures of the Harry Potter movies as uneven as theyve been is that of watching Radcliffe Watson and Grint grow up both as people and as actors. One problem inherent in the series is that characters we came to love in the earlier books and movies must recede to make way for the new ones. That means Gary Oldmans Sirius Black appears in only a few scenes here but once again hes wonderful. (With his curly locks and velvet officers coat he looks like a denizen of Glastonbury circa 1971.) And Stauntons Umbridge with her smug little smile and matronly deportment is frighteningly perfect. The movies costume and production design serve her well too In her sensible square-heeled shoes and pink Welsh capes circa 1975 shes the essence of dowdy propriety. And in one of the movies wittiest visual touches her office walls are covered with dozens of porcelain plates each adorned with a purring mewing wriggling soft-focus kitten -- a marvelous bit of shorthand for the cozy oppressiveness of cutesy decor. Theres plenty to look at in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" and while this isnt the prettiest Harry Potter movie cinematographer Slawomir Idziak always prevents it from appearing overdone or gaudy. (Idziak shot Ridley Scotts ""Black Hawk Down"" and also collaborated with the late Krzysztof Kieslowski on nearly a dozen films.) The most frustrating thing about the picture is that in packing so much information and so many events into a very tight framework Yates and Goldenberg lose the flow of the story. The picture desperately needs some fluidity. Even so ""The Order of the Phoenix"" is an honorable movie one that struggles to stay true to Rowlings intention and her tone. As a whole it may not be as lyrical as we fans of Rowlings books might wish. But Yates at least gives us poetry in individual stanzas. And sometimes just a few good lines are enough to carry you through a poem. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

"Review Able Potter growing darker - CNN.com Review Able Potter growing darkerStory Highlights Tom Charity New ""Potter"" movie is most somber of the Potter movies Charity Movie has less wonder and less fun than earlier Potter movies Charity Theres enough suspense built into the saga to keep us all watching Movie based on JK Rowlings longest book Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO PHOTOS INTERACTIVE By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Its a difficult age. Fifteen-year-old Harry Potter (the ever-improving Daniel Radcliffe) is at the mercy of his hormones. Hes having trouble sleeping his guardians -- the Dursleys -- want no more to do with him and hes threatened with expulsion from Hogwarts after pulling out his wand in public. It feels like the whole world is against him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""more photos >> Of course thats far from the case. Among Muggles theres no more popular literary hero. And even in his own realm Harry has an enviable support group of friends and allies including the so-called Order of the Phoenix a motley crew of familiar faces that nevertheless remains mysterious for now. If he can bring himself to put his trust in them perhaps Harry can also learn to trust himself. At 870 pages this is J.K. Rowlings longest book and by consensus its not her best. Director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg (""Peter Pan"") have been more ruthless with the red ink than their predecessors for which movie fans should certainly be grateful. In fact at 138 minutes this is the shortest of the Potter movies to date. Its also the most somber beginning with a scary Dementors attack in a dimly lit underpass and ending with an impressively staged battle between the forces of good and evil in the cavernous black-tiled Department of Mysteries. Dont Miss I-Reporters show their love for Harry Are you ready for Harry Potters last stand? In between Professor Dolores Umbridge employs all manner of tricks to trip up Harry and his friends. A stooge appointed to Hogwarts by the Ministry of Magic the evil professor rapidly assumes the position of High Inquisitor in order to root out Dumbledores supposedly insurrectionary conspirators. Imelda Staunton (""Vera Drake"") is hardly the short flabby toad-like Umbridge of the book. A giggly disciplinarian in pink knits she rather reminded me of Queen Elizabeth II though I suspect theres a deliberate echo of Margaret Thatcher in the way she pronounces her cruel diktats with a passive-aggressive feminine sweetness. Larry talks to ""Harry"" Watch ""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe on ""Larry King Live."" Sunday 9 p.m. ET. see full schedule >> This despicable petty government functionary masks her prejudice and sadism in blinkered loyalty to her paranoid boss Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge. But as villains go Umbridge is a poor substitute for you-know-who -- the terrifying and elusive Voldemort. Umbridge is a rotten teacher and dangerously deluded but in the movie she is often a distraction from the big picture; its a fundamental flaw that shes allowed to dominate for long stretches. For the rest -- regrettably -- the adults mostly take a back seat as Harry sets about teaching practical pro-active magic to his schoolmates for the ever-impending showdown. Theres a reduced role for Ron (Rupert Grint) too though the Weasleys pull off one spectacular fireworks display. Perhaps mindful of feminist criticism Hermione (Emma Watson) takes the initiative once or twice. Which is nice. Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potters latest >> Mind you shes still pretty vapid in comparison with the movies two most arresting new characters the friendly but decidedly weird Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) and the not-so-friendly but excitingly freaky Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter in banshee mode). An experienced BBC TV director Yates makes a reasonably strong showing on this difficult assignment but like most of the earlier films in the series it feels more like potted ""Potter"" than a movie in its own right. Theres still enough suspense built into the saga to keep us watching but after five installments this dazzling box office wizard is slowly running out of tricks. Theres less wonder here and less fun -- not even a Quidditch match. In its place is a prevailing sense of grim determination. Like I said its a difficult age. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is rated PG-13 and runs 138 minutes. E-mail to a friend All About J.K.

Share Tweet The latest installment in the Harry Potter series opens with a storm gathering precipitously over the young wizards head portending an attack by the Dementors those soul-sucking wraiths that circle their prey like buzzards. Its moments like these that show how far J.K. Rowlings hero has come from the beginning when he was delivered from a Dickensian home life into a gee-whiz world of flying broomsticks whimsical creatures and other magical enchantments. Now dark clouds follow him around like Pig-Pens filth and being a wizard has become a joyless burden a destiny that he grimly accepts as his lot in life. Though there are moments of levity scattered throughout Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix the workmanlike fifth entry in the franchise the overall feeling is that it sucks to be Harry Potter and its only going to get suckier from here on out. Though he fends off the Dementors Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) gets expelled from Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry for using a forbidden curse in the presence of a ""muggle."" He wins back admittance on appeal but many members of the Ministry Of Magic refuse to accept his contention that the evil Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and plans to engage the forces of good in a battle royal. As a measure to keep Harry and his cohorts in line the Ministry installs prim taskmaster Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as the new professor of Dark Arts and she keeps them busy with grueling memorization and paperwork. Harry revolts by creating Dumbledores Army a group of rebel students who harness their powers in a secret training room. Hes also introduced to the Order Of The Phoenix a clandestine faction preparing for a showdown with Voldemort. While not all Harry Potter movies are created equal consistency has been a major priority for the series to the point where its become the Prozac of blockbuster franchises--few highs or lows just a general baseline of pleasing competence. Granted theres a significant difference between the flat literalness of Chris Columbus first two entries and Alfonso Cuarons fanciful Prisoner Of Azkaban but the films are telling one long story and inspiration is often sacrificed for continuitys sake. Directed by David Yates who has a background in British television Order Of The Phoenix feels a little too complacent at times though it has moments of visual wit and it doesnt soft-pedal the dark mood that has eclipsed the series. Save for the thrilling opening sequence theres not much to remember about the film beyond Staunton (Vera Drake) who masks her bottomless malevolence behind a pasted-on patrician smile. During this transitional stage Dumbledores Army and the Order Of The Phoenix prepare for bigger fights ahead--and presumably more exciting movies too.

"A Bewitching Brew Of Thrills and Slapstick washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies A Bewitching Brew Of Thrills and Slapstick Daniel Radcliffe portrays the boy wizard for a fifth time in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" joined by a terrific predominantly British cast. (Warner Bros. Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday July 11 2007 Worried -- arent we? -- that Harry Potter might cast his final spell in Book 7. But as many fans anguish over the possible demise of their hero they can take entertaining solace in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" one of the most pleasurable films in the series. ""The Order of the Phoenix"" offers a passel of darkly compelling distractions. And in Daniel Radcliffe Potterphiles can still enjoy the bespectacled wiry hero as he contends with the bureaucratic evil of the Ministry of Magic the prospect of his nemesis Lord Voldemorts return and his first romantic kiss--with Cho (Katie Leung) the demure student whos clearly sweet on him. (Well presumably know Harrys ultimate fate July 21 with the publication of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" the seventh and ""final"" book in J.K. Rowlings popular series.) Leaner than its cinematic predecessors at 138 minutes the fifth Potter film has trimmed Rowlings garrulous character-crowded novel (at 870 pages its her chunkiest installment) into an urgently paced thriller that modulates adroitly between psychological darkness and cartoonish slapstick. But director David Yates a British filmmaker who formerly worked in television and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg both newcomers to the ""Harry"" franchise have not cut away the storys powerful thematic underpinnings. The story is built around the hidebound Ministry of Magic which is in the business of keeping the truth from its wizard population. (Audiences can infer any number of contemporary parallels.) The granite impassive faces of the ministrys council as its members listen unsympathetically to Harrys testimony about the impending threat of Voldemort are more menacing than any special-effects evil the dark prince might perform. We dont get as much meaningful time as we might like with Harrys inner circle--his mates Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). But thats because the story focuses on so many provocative characters and creatures -- those statuesque centaurs for instance and a certain lovable giant in the woods. The best character of all may be newcomer Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) a chilly emissary from the ministry who joins Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft to spy on Harry and his headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Doloress organization does not believe Harrys contention that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is marshaling his deadly forces again. So Dolores a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher has come to discredit Dumbledore and stifle Harry. Stauntons brilliant performance is a frosty mixture of arch sanctimoniousness and Maggie Thatcher steel. It made this reviewer remember Umbridges from his own English boarding school upbringing. (Ms. B the mathematics teacher who handed out detentions with that soft silky voice -- a sort of velvet-gloved executioner. And Ms. M. the French teacher who liked to display her leathery hand to classes as a permanent warning to pay attention.) Staunton is part of an embarrassment of riches among the predominantly British cast. Silkily funereal Alan Rickman as Severus Snape makes contempt seem like a fashion statement. Gary Oldman is wonderfully sensitive as Harrys protective godfather Sirius Black. And Emma Thompson conjures up Sybil Trelawney the schools resident goofball. Such actors could make an ordinary drama seem as though it dripped directly from the nib of Shakespeare. But ""Order of the Phoenix"" is a ripping good story and that magnifies the pleasure of watching these great actors work. The camera which seems to be attached to the wings of a majestic owl takes audiences on a soaring swooping tour through the corridors of Hogwarts above its gothic turrets in the upper rafters of the foreboding Ministry of Magic hearing room and over the serpentine bends of the River Thames. It makes for a heady summer treat experiencing the aerial exhilaration of life as a wizard where so many things are possible. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (138 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for fantasy violence and frightening images.

Until Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix the Potter pictures were that rare franchise in which each new film topped the prior one. This time around theres a notable backslide the filmmakers frustrated in their attempt to telescope 800-plus pages into two-plus hours during which Harry fights demons inner and outer while experiencing hormonal surges and grieving the loss of a loved one. In Phoenix director David Yates who has exhibited sensitive rapport with actors in his work for British TV (The Girl in the Cafe The Way We Live Now) does a splendid job with the performers. Standouts are Gary Oldman as Sirius Black Harrys sly father-surrogate and Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge Hogwarts Maggie Thatcherish new headmistress a tyrant in Pepto-Bismol pink. But Yates lacks a steady grip on the shape and rhythm of the film where the teen wizard challenges Umbridge a smiling despot by founding a resistance movement thats enlisted during a showdown at the Ministry of Magic. Clearly a people person (a good thing in a director) Yates does not always successfully integrate his humans with the special effects. More often than not the effects overwhelm the story. An exception is a thrilling sequence in which Harry and company zoom over a twinkling London astride Thestrals winged horses flying in formation like a gaggle of enchanted geese. Befitting the teens at the center of its story the mood of Phoenix is stormier - in terms of both temperament and weather - than Potters previous. ""I feel so angry all the time"" exclaims Harry whose rage has meteorological effect not unlike that of Stephen Kings Carrie. Harry has special powers and though its forbidden to use them in front of Muggles he isnt fully in control of his emotions. While his cousin bullies him during a heat wave that has left England yellow and parched a flock of dementors preys on Harry (Daniel Radcliffe muscled as though fresh from the weight room) who uses his wand to subdue the life-sucking spirits. Practicing underage magic like driving without a license gets Harry suspended from Hogwarts and tried by a tribunal. Dumbledore and associates get Harry reinstated. Still the folks over at the Ministry of Magic sorcerys Department of State deny Harrys claims that Lord Voldemort (the noseless Ralph Fiennes) is alive and a threat to the wizarding realm. The familiar rituals and rhythms of Hogwarts are largely absent from Order of the Phoenix which presents the school and its new management no longer as a bewitching academic retreat but as a dank prison where Umbridge is new warden. Not only does Harry long to break free of Hogwarts but he fights to break into the Ministry of Magic - controlled by his political opponents - to find the prophecy that holds his fate. Harrys nightmarish premonitions flicker through much of The Order of the Phoenix. The fascinating politics of this tale - with the racial purists at the Ministry of Magic who oppose Harrys ideology of inclusion his advocacy of those like Hermione who are born of Muggle parents and of mixed breeds like the centaurs - are not as explicit here as they are in the book. Initially hired to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Umbridge dictates that students learn theory rather than actually practice wizarding. Which is like telling virtuosos that they can study the premises of music rather than play their instruments. As much to subvert Umbridge Protectorate as to prepare for moral battle Harry creates ""Dumbledores Army"" Hogwarts version of the military that initiates the Restoration of Dumbledore. Still as he secretly trains his friends in the art of wands curses and levitation Harry wonders why Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are so ... remote. And yes this is the movie that features Harrys first kiss which lacks the electricity of his relations with Hermione. In short theres a lot going on in a movie that proceeds in three directions at once. It seems to be a rule that the Potter franchise constitutes a full-employment act for Brit thespians. And Yates seems to have everyone except Hugh Grant and Helen Mirren in this one. Finally fleeting glimpses of the introverted Emma Thompson and the extroverted Helena Bonham Carter distract the moviegoer from the very critical business of Harrys coming of age in the romantic political and wizarding senses.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Picture Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Harry Potter has something Lord Voldemort needs Deep in the bowels of the Ministry of Magic resides a glowing orb of prophecy essential to both Harry and Voldemort. Eventually both will reach it and fireworks will erupt but not until Harry goes through all sorts of living hell. The fun and games are over in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The film is darker scarier and more intense than its predecessors and its not as though things werent grim in The Goblet of Fire. Partly due to its intensity Order of the Phoenix is better than the first four in the series. Also credit a much tighter meatier script and better acting. Harry Potter has improved with each sequel. After the indifferent editing and direction of the first two episodes which all but scuttled good stories and excellent production design its been steadily uphill for the past three entries. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix the book weighed in at a door-stopping 900 pages give or take. Author J.K Rowling often uses 10 words where six would do but her abundant wonderfully vivid imagination is pretty tough to squeeze into two hours and seven minutes (plus 11 minutes of credits). British TV director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg do not waste a second getting the story on the rails. No comically dithering scenes with the dreaded Dursleys Harrys foster parents to start this film. The film opens with an almost immediate attack on Harry and Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) by two deadly Dementors. The assault set in a dark narrow grimy tunnel establishes a tone that will be adhered to throughout the movie. Yates and his team have shrunk Hogwarts halls dimmed its flickering fires and given the tidying house-elves some time off. It all adds to the oppressive tense atmosphere reflecting Harrys increasingly tormented mental state and ever more threatening events. Credit much of this to the claustrophobic cinematography of Slawomir Idziak (Black Hawk Down) and the wonderful set and production design. While its hard to pinpoint anything specifically different about Hogwarts from the past two films what once seemed open and airy now seems cramped and threatening. Parents of young children should take the films PG-13 rating ``for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images quite seriously. There is worse on late-night television but theres still plenty here to scare those not emotionally prepared. By defending himself and Dudley from attack Harry gets himself expelled from Hogwarts for the illegal use of magic and then must stand trial to be reinstated. If Harry or we expect things to get back to normal hope is soon nipped by a dumpy small pink-encased package called Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) who has been sent to excise both joy and substance from a Hogwarts education. Umbridge is a fanatical disciple of the head-in-the-sand Minister of Magic who believes Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is dead and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is planning to take over the Ministry. Umbridges tormenting of Hogwarts students and staff inadvertently allows Voldemort to come closer to the secret that connects he and Harry. Rowlings exceptional creativity goes on unabated with each creation or fantastic event piled on the next. The film is packed with wonderful camera angles constantly moving perspective and some nifty special effects (such as the Weasley twins fireworks) but virtually no comic moments to lighten the heavy going. It is however a fast-paced adventure continuing Harrys coming-of-age story and psychological drama. There is one moment worth special note Harrys long-awaited first kiss with the emotionally conflicted Cho (Katie Leung). Its handled well and while hardly carnal its genuine. Fortunately the maturing actors are increasingly able to handle the complexities of their roles. The number of significant youthful characters has increased and Yates gets good or at least workable performances from almost all of them. As usual Daniel Radcliffe as Harry carries the major burden and this time there is more genuine pain in his performance. Rupert Grint as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione both of whom have had more than their share of unconvincing moments in the series now seem to fully command their roles. Most of this may be attributed to their advancing age and experience but Yates - who already is set to direct the next Potter film - is at least as good as Mike Newell (Goblet of Fire) in guiding them on camera. So when Harry says to his little band late in the film that ``We all have something that Voldemort doesnt - we can understand what it is - and its not the globe of prophecy - without being told. Virtually missing from this film are most of the regulars. Draco Malfoy Hagrid Professor McGonagall and many others in Harrys life make only token appearances. This film belongs to Harry and the small band of students who rally round him. Remarkably Yates and Goldenberg - for all their compressing and trimming and abrupt cuts to tighten and speed along the tale - Order of the Phoenix is the shortest Potter film so far 14 minutes shorter than Sorcerers Stone - keep it all comprehensible though sometimes just barely. Hmm well make that comprehensible if youve read the book. If not there may be a few places where you have to just leap blindly and land on faith. Like why the young heroes have to fly on winged thestrals to their climactic confrontation with He Who Shall Not Be Named. The minor fact that their broomsticks had been impounded didnt make the films final cut. Hardcore readers those who read the books more than once may feel a little shortchanged. But that just gives you another excuse to reread the book. Like you needed one. louis.parkschron.com Todays Deals Wide-Ruled 70-Sheet Spiral-Bound Notebook for 17 cents +...

"Plot darkens as boy wizard faces demons | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPlot darkens as boy wizard faces demonsCould a sinister presence in the Harry Potter books be forcing critics normally the sunniest of souls to type gloomily in tandem?From left Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  (COURTSEY OF WARNER BROS. PICTURE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. July 10 2007With each successive Harry Potter release book or movie variations of the word ""dark"" gain greater emphasis in reviews. Could a sinister presence be forcing critics normally the sunniest of souls to type gloomily in tandem?All kidding aside the Potter franchise is maturing along with its core audience which is now facing adulthood with its attendant challenges fears and disillusionments. Author J.K. Rowlings greatest achievement is realizing that her creations must grow and confront all kinds of adversity if they are to remain relevant.So it is that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix the fifth movie in the series and matched to the fifth book is by far the darkest to date. To the point that wise parents might want to think twice before taking children under age 10 or so to see it.This is the episode where ghastly Dementors launch an attack that causes physical and psychological damage the latter on orphan wizard Harry (Daniel Radcliffe). He is accused of using ""underage magic"" to battle the demons and is forced to defend his actions in a kangaroo court convened by the increasingly fascistic Ministry of Magic.Harry has many allies Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is still on his side as are his loyal school chums Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) along with the members of the benevolent Order of the Phoenix who are to be revealed.Article Continued BelowYet Harry feels ""more alone than ever"" and also angrier moods that actor Radcliffe has learned to express effectively. Harrys claim that the evil Lord Voldemort has returned as we saw in episode four is hotly disputed by Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) the Minister for Magic and mocked in The Daily Prophet a newspaper now turned to scandal sheet.To make matters worse the students arrive for their fifth year at Hogwarts to find a virtual police state. Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton divinely cast) the Senior Undersecretary to Minister Fudge is granted almost total control of the school. She sets about cruelly punishing miscreant students - Harry being the first to feel her sting - and firing teachers at whim. She will brook no talk of Voldemorts return and furthermore she believes that learning to fight the dark lord and his minions is a waste of time ""Progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged"" she declares.All the while Voldemorts presence grows ever stronger and theres the unsettling prospect that hes invaded Harrys mind in the search for a weapon that could devastate wizards and muggles both. Harry struggles to unite his fractious colleagues and to secretly school them in defensive arts. Symbolic connections with real-life terrorism and war are unmistakeable and intended.The jet-black mood of Order of the Phoenix is made all the darker by changes to key personnel. Director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg new to the franchise are obviously in no mood for the Quidditch matches and mirthful ghosts and goblins of yore. They focus upon the gathering storm an event foreshadowed by the aggressive score by Nicholas Hooper another newcomer.One of the ironies of Order of the Phoenix is that this is the shortest Potter movie yet (still long at 2 hours 20 minutes) made from the most massive book in the series (870 pages). To achieve this has required serious conflation of story threads and characters so events and people zoom across the screen. Harrys slow-burning romance with fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung) is drastically abbreviated while faces both familiar (all the Hogwarts teachers) and new (such as Evanna Lynchs enigmatic Luna Lovegood) compete for camera time and our attentions.Another irony is that author Rowling has introduced a character as authoritarian and fussy as Umbridge while at the same time loosening her own death grip upon the screen adaptations. No longer is she insisting that every last thread of her narrative wind up on the screen - and let us all give thanks for that.The result is a movie much more in the mode of a conventional thriller than previous Potter outings at least until the muddled ending when too many characters and ideas converge and the plot reaches a cliff that may be flattened by the series-wrapping seventh book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows out July 21. But thats a chance every Potter fan will have to take. They can heed the words of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) Harrys cherished godfather who tells him ""Whats life without a little risk?""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Picture REVIEW / Harried Harry / In his fifth outing the wizard matures -- and faces plenty of grown-up problems 1 / 1 Back to Gallery REVIEW Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Fantasy adventure. Starring Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint and Ralph Fiennes. Directed by David Yates. (PG-13. 138 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Passionate fans of the ""Harry Potter"" series will find things to enjoy in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" But others naive types stumbling in just hoping to see a movie that stands on its own will find a long picture with a few pleasing moments one standout performance and a lot of unnecessary plot loops. It all depends on the perspective Taken as a motion picture the new ""Harry"" comes up short. But taken as a visual aid to the experience of reading a book the new ""Harry"" does its job. The picture benefits from the time-lapse photographic maturation of Daniel Radcliffe who now has the capacity to bring a sophisticated internal life to young Harry. This is a character who suffers a lot inside and when he was a child Radcliffe could only simulate that. Now he can take it in feel it and show it. He has been growing while Emma Watson as his friend Hermione can now give Jessica Alba a run for her money -- that is in the cant-say-two-sentences-without-sounding-false department. Lets accentuate the positive for a moment. Any movie that has Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) walking around with a napkin ring in his beard cant be all bad. The same could be said for any movie that has Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort) looking like he just got back from seeing Michael Jacksons plastic surgeon. Anyone who appreciates British villains will take pleasure not only in Fiennes but in Jason Isaacs as his ice-cold functionary Lucius and Alan Rickman as Snape. Actually Rickman plays a good guy but fortunately it seems that someone forgot to tell him. The best villain of all is the villainess Dolores Umbridge a mole from the ministry who is sent to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with the intention of weakening the training. As Dolores Imelda Staunton gives the performance to take from the movie presenting her as a study in happy self-delusion. She is someone who is convinced of her own kindness when shes vindictive convinced that shes sincere when shes a liar and convinced of her grandeur of spirit when shes petty and mean. Dressed like Jackie Kennedy in Dallas Staunton goes through the movie in a flutter of self-satisfaction and succeeds in being simultaneously hilarious utterly recognizable as a type and thoroughly hateful. They dont give Oscars for movies like this but Staunton is as good or better here than she was in ""Vera Drake"" in which she was nominated for a best actress Oscar. Also in this movies favor are its visuals which are often more than just realistic presentations of the impossible (we take that for granted by now) but artistically and aesthetically rendered. A flight across the Thames at night on broomsticks is a beautiful thing to see. A similar flight later in the film on thestrals is almost equally satisfying. Likewise the movie takes pains to present in amusing detail the hustle and bustle of a ministry building depicted as a kind of magical version of Grand Central Terminal -- lots of crowds with everyone in a hurry and everyone taking the magic for granted. With such distractions who would even notice that ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" has a story thats just plain lousy? Unfortunately thats impossible not to notice. Heres just one example but a good one to give in that it happens in the first 20 minutes. Harry uses his magic powers outside school and for this infraction of Hogwarts regulations he is threatened with expulsion. He goes up before the court. He makes his case ... and the court doesnt expel him. Thus the movie takes 20 minutes to leave Harry exactly where he was. In other words those are 20 minutes no one needed to see. And there are similar plot loops there either to replicate the book or to lengthen the film to junior-epic dimensions. The story here is quite obscure and small-scale. The ministry is worried that Hogwarts presents a security risk and so it prevents it from pursuing military-like training not realizing that Lord Voldemort is back and preparing for an attack. But does he attack? ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" begins with a lot of wheel spinning and it ends before anything really happens. In between you get lots of scenes of people pointing wands and of computer-graphic sparkles coming out of them. Over and over sticks and sparks. Excuse me if I dont break into a verse of ""Thats Entertainment."" With this installment the intention to make a discrete movie of every ""Harry Potter"" book suddenly seems misguided -- justifiable only financially not artistically. The truth is theres a really good one-hour movie here but youll have to blast through 138 minutes to find it. -- Advisory Magic violence and existential despair.

By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Who would have guessed that a giggly 50-ish lady in a fuzzy pink suit could upstage all the witches wizards and dark villains that populate the world of Harry Potter? But such is the case in the enchantingly rendered Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (   1/2 out of four) which features the versatile British actress Imelda Staunton as the smug order-loving Dolores Umbridge. MORE Anger at allies enemies brews in Harry GROWING UP Radcliffe torn between two worlds QUIZ Test your Harry Potter smarts The character as written by J.K. Rowling in her fifth Harry Potter book was nuanced and cleverly conceived on the page. But Staunton brings her own disquieting flourishes to the part as well as superb comic timing. The fluttery giggles and singsong voice added by Staunton are brilliant choices. Shes a vision of villainy in rose her starched bouffant coif decorated by little pink bows. Order of the Phoenix deals with Harrys efforts to convince his Hogwarts classmates that Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is ready to attack. Harry is portrayed as a liar by the Ministry of Magic (its headquarters gorgeously designed in a style that blends Victorian with futuristic art). He clandestinely organizes a gathering of students teaching them to defend themselves against dark magic. The film has the look and feel of a contemporary horror thriller particularly in scenes in which Harry has nightmares involving Voldemort. Also chilling is a sequence in which he and his friends battle the masked Death Eaters. These scenes typified by sharp fast cuts and terrifying visuals suit the dark material. Tautly directed and artfully shot by David Yates Order of the Phoenix has poignant moments along with visual panache. (Several overhead shots of the Ministry buildings and Hogwarts school are stunning.) The movie opens with Harry an orphan longingly watching a mother and child at the playground. He also has an emotional exchange with his godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who reassures Harry about his spiraling anger. Among the films most haunting moments is Harrys anguished reaction to a tragedy after an epic battle. A pair of flying sequences dazzle with Harry and others soaring over the Thames on broomstick and later on the backs of thestrals huge winged equine/reptilian creatures. Less intriguing is a scene involving dementors visualized less artfully by Yates than in Alfonso Cuarons Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Harry has his first on-screen kiss with Cho Chang (Katie Leung). Its a tender moment but much of the books romance is left out of the film. Helena Bonham Carter co-stars as the evil Bellatrix Lestrange but the character seems like Version 666.0 of several of her punk-Goth portrayals. The special effects continue to be masterful but villains are given a new twist and Order of the Phoenix is all the more fun because of it. (Rated PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images. Running time 2 hours 18 minutes. Opens tonight in select theaters nationwide on Wednesday.)

"Movie 5 Order of the Phoenix magical but dark - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Chandra Levy Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeMovie 5 Order of the Phoenix magical but darkGrim `Phoenix reflects fight facing Harry wizard friendsBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 07/10/2007 014841 AM PDTUpdated 06/16/2011 024555 PM PDTClick photo to enlarge This undated photo supplied by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Daniel Radcliffe who plays Harry Potter in a scene from Warner Bros. Pictures new fantasy ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" The movie opens in theaters around the world starting Wednesday July 11 2007.( AP Photo/Warner Bros.Pictures Murray Close) <<1>> No matter what happens to Harry Potter when the final installment of J.K. Rowlings enormously popular series is released in 11 days it cant be much darker - or more dramatic - than the challenge the young wizard faces with the re-emergence of Lord Voldemort in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" The movie which opens nationwide Wednesday after late showings tonight is so full of sinister portent that it might as well be called ""Harry Potter and the Inescapable Sense of Impending Doom and Gloom."" ""Theres a storm coming"" Potters old friend Hagrid (Robby Coltrane) warns Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) at one point ""and wed all best be ready when it does."" No kidding. Judging by the size of the black cloud that hovers over this movie they may need an ark. For all its gloominess ""Order of the Phoenix"" is in several ways the best Potter picture yet. Still it is pitifully slow getting started and it appears to have been lit with Bunsen burners making it the dreariest-looking of the five ""Potters."" But in spite of that or perhaps because of it the movie is like a mood stone with the baleful look of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry meant to match Harrys sense of despair. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is the most emotionally involving story of the series. Harry must face his fears - not least among them that he is becoming like Voldemort - before he can grow as a wizard.Advertisement Harry must endure several trials and unlike earlier installments the outcome involves much more than bragging rights to some magic tournament. The first trial is a literal one following Harrys shocking expulsion from Hogwarts for illegally using magic outside of school and in front of a muggle or non-magical person. This inquisition before the Ministry of Magic accomplishes little (we do learn the meaning of the Order of the Phoenix) and only delays the start of the real story. Harry is successfully defended by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) who nevertheless seems curiously aloof toward his young charge. Claiming to have seen the mysterious Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) Harry is met with disbelief and derision from Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) and the suspicion that hes a liar rapidly spreads through the school. More than ever before the thing that makes Harry special also makes him an outcast. To keep an eye on Potter and Dumbledore Fudge assigns Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) - a fascist in pink angora jackets - as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Why the Ministry is so set against Harry is never made clear in the movie and I kept wondering if I was expected to remember this plot detail from ""Goblet of Fire"" or if its something that only careful readers of the books would understand. Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) the title character in ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" does reveal that Fudge is trying to prevent Harry and his classmates from being trained in combat. He doesnt say why. ""Voldemort is on the move"" he warns Harry. ""For now at least it looks as if youre on your own."" He isnt actually. Thats the point at which Harrys pals Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) help him form what they call Dumbledores Army and it becomes clear that Harry has friends. Good ones and plenty of them. This is made clear to him by Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch in a memorable debut) an ethereal girl who tells Harry that it may be Voldemort who wants him to feel isolated. Umbridge briefly turns Hogwarts into a totalitarian state delivering her threats and tirades with a little girls laugh - snits and giggles. ""You know deep down that you deserve to be punished dont you?"" she asks menacingly. Shes talking to Harry at the time but in the gathering darkness of ""Order of the Phoenix"" it could apply to any one of us. Contact Bruce Newman at bnewman mercurynews.com or (408) 920-5004.

"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix ) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (United States/United Kingdom 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli With its fifth cinematic outing the Harry Potter film series has ascended to another level. In addition to providing a self-contained well-paced adventure Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix also begins to coalesce the epic ether that has been building over the past four films (especially the last two). With this movie we sense that were on the brink of something big dark and ominous. ""By the pricking of my thumbs something wicked this way comesa|"" For a franchise that began under the lightweight guardianship of director Chris Columbus these pictures have gotten progressively darker. The Order of the Phoenix is easily the gloomiest yet. The movie is not suitable for young children (although considering that Harrys core audience has aged considerably since the release of the first book in 1997 that shouldnt be a big problem). This may be the first Harry Potter movie that cannot stand on its own. There are too many references to past events and too many characters from the earlier films for a neophyte not to get at least a little lost. This is a welcome development since it signals that the series has passed the setup point and is getting into the meat of the good-versus-evil battle. Although The Order of the Phoenix does not end in cliffhanger style theres more than a passing sense that the undercurrent is beginning to bubble and churn. We can be thankful that theres only an 18 month wait for the next installment (or for those who cant stand the suspense the book isnt hard to find). The Order of the Phoenix is the first Harry Potter feature not adapted by screenwriter Steve Kloves who moved straight from The Goblet of Fire to The Half-Blood Prince. Michael Goldenberg does an admirable job filling the breach. He streamlines the overstuffed novel into a compact package that fills only about 2 1/4 hours worth of screen time without losing any of the main plot points. To be sure much is lost but fans of the books will find that the movie is faithful if not slavishly so to the text. For those who have gotten their Harry Potter fix entirely through the cinematic incarnation the script is lucid and fast-moving. Theres no sense that reading the book is necessary to the understanding of the plot. Director David Yates becomes the fourth man to sit in the series directors chair. (He will also helm The Half-Blood Prince.) Of the four Yates has the least impressive pedigree having spent the majority of his career working in British television. His vision of Harry Potters world is much like Mike Newells (The Goblet of Fire). Its a gray dreary place where darkness has overspread everything. The wonder of magic evident in the first two films is gone. Magic is now more than likely something dangerous and to be feared. In The Order of the Phoenix the battle lines are being drawn with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his legion of Death Eaters and twisted creatures on one side and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends on the other. Harry is supported by schoolmates such as Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) Cho Chang (Katie Leung) Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) and Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) and by adults such as Hogwarts Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) Professor Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Sirius Black (Gary Oldman). But there are those who distrust Harrys pronouncement that the Dark Lord has returned. The Ministry of Magic sees a conspiracy in this and sends Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to Hogwarts as an Inquisitor to sort things out. After usurping Dumbledores position she sets her sights on neutering Harry. But evil forces are abroad and Harry must teach his fellow students how to defend themselves or risk annihilation. Umbridge wants Harrys secret magic lessons stopped and she will do whatever is necessary to accomplish that aim. Meanwhile Voldemorts plans take root. The Order of the Phoenix continues the character development that has been in evidence throughout the series. Individuals who started out life as bundles of carefully grouped stock characteristics have become complex and interesting. Jealousy rage envy and sexual attraction have all reared their heads. In a much-publicized scene Harry gets to experience his first kiss. The movie never threatens to turn into a romance or after-school special but it highlights that theres more to these characters than reciting Latin words and taming giants. At the center of the story isnt the struggle against Voldemort but the friendship between Harry Ron and Hermione. Theyre teenagers now and they interact differently than in the early films but the passage of years has only strengthened their bonds. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint have developed into fine actors. Radcliffe had an opportunity to show his range (and a few other things) in a much publicized stage performance while Grint has honed his talent in the British film Driving Lesson. Emma Watson remains the weak link in the cast; not coincidentally the only role she has ever played is Hermione. As has been the case for all the films the adult cast is a ""whos who"" of British cinema. Cast members Michael Gambon Maggie Smith Ralph Fiennes Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are joined by Harry Potter virgins Imelda Staunton and Helena Bonham Carter. Rickman once again proves that ambiguity can be more chilling than pure evil. His Snape is a lot more frightening than Fiennes Voldemort. When it comes to generating unparalleled audience hatred however no one does it better than Imelda Staunton and thats in part because the smile rarely drops. She could shoot a man dead at ten paces with that smile. Its my impression that the Harry Potter movies have been getting progressively better. In the beginning the filmmakers were too intimidated by the books. Over the years they have taken more liberties allowing the features to achieve a unique identity - related yet not yoked to J.K. Rowlings hugely successful series. I have heard it mentioned in some quarters that The Order of the Phoenix is regarded as one of the weaker novels yet it is arguably the best film. Though Yates style may not be on par with that of Alfonso Cuaron (The Prisoner of Azkaban) there is more substance. The movie flows and moves. Theres a sense of adventure and the progression of events is not predictable. The special effects arent the best of the summer but theyre more than good enough to get the job done and several shots are breathtaking. I walked out of The Order of the Phoenix feeling like I had experienced something rather than being pummeled senseless by explosions and soulless robots. When Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone debuted in 2001 it felt like a watered-down childrens version of The Lord of the Rings. Six years later Tolkiens trilogy is done but Rowlings longer serial is just hitting its stride. With The Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter has truly come into his own fulfilling the promise of The Prisoner of Azkaban and The Goblet of Fire. These are no longer cute stories of wizards and magic and things that go bump in the night. They are dark tales where the themes and creatures become increasingly distorted as the frames whiz by. The Order of the Phoenix is the best on offer to-date from the Harry Potter cinematic franchise and one of the few reasons during the summer of 2007 to venture out to a multiplex.

"A watched `Potter - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW A watched `Potter`Order of the Phoenix never quite boils even with a hot cast.July 10 2007|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer ""HARRY Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is no stand-alone film or even part of a constantly reinvented franchise like James Bond. Rather its a cog in a brisk well-oiled machine the fifth in what ultimately will be a series of seven films that function like chapters in the worlds longest-running serial. If youve sampled the previous episodes youll likely see this one no matter what its qualities and if you havent seen any of the others there isnt much justification for jumping in at the middle.The Potter films are especially unusual because theyve used the same actors for the key roles with the trio of juvenile leads (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron) aging along with their characters. The screenwriter has also been the same although Steve Kloves took a break here capably replaced by Michael Goldenberg. Its only the directors whove changed with regularity and their personas have up to a point imprinted themselves on their films.In fact the Harry Potter movies have been with us for so long (since 2001) that its helpful to view them in stages similar to Elisabeth Kubler-Ross celebrated five stages of grief. But instead of denial anger and depression we get risk avoidance artistic vision and consolidation of gains.If director Chris Columbus represented risk aversion with the first two Potter films Alfonso Cuaron and Mike Newell in the third and fourth stood up for artistry while British TV director David Yates seems intent in this fifth chapter on not jeopardizing what has been accomplished up to now.Though Yates hasnt brought any overpowering directorial style to ""Phoenix"" he does have some advantages. As the terrifying wizard Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) grows in power Potters world noticeably darkens and gets more involving. Plus having a cast that includes the cream of current British actors -- think Michael Gambon Brendan Gleeson Jason Isaacs Gary Oldman Alan Rickman Maggie Smith Imelda Staunton David Thewlis Emma Thompson and thats not the entire list -- certainly doesnt hurt.Yates and his team handle the films visuals well including the impressive sets for the atrium of the Ministry of Magic and its Hall of Prophecy as well as fine flying sequences involving either broomsticks or equine creatures called Thestrals.The director also works well with the films juvenile leads which is important because these are the raging hormone years at Hogwarts School and that is especially true where Harry is concerned. Looking so disgruntled in his gray hoodie that you fear he might start rapping Harry comes off as more Grumpy Potter than the bright light of the wizarding world.In truth there are reasons why Harry seems to be headed for his 19th nervous breakdown. His great protector Dumbledore (Gambon) wont give him the time of day his romantic life is a shambles and the anti-Voldemort fighters spearheaded by his godfather Sirius Black (Oldman) think hes too young to be a full-fledged warrior.Even worse the phlegmatic Ministry of Magic refuses to so much as acknowledge that Voldemort is back in the game. The unctuous Dolores Umbridge the ministrys pick as Hogwarts new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher declines point blank to impart anything beyond theoretical knowledge. Impeccably played by Imelda Staunton (the star of Mike Leighs very different ""Vera Drake"") this pink-clad presence comes off like Miss Piggys noticeably evil twin.Thinned down from the series longest book ""Phoenix"" cant shake an episodic feeling that makes it difficult to develop momentum. Though many of its elements are strong including newcomer Evanna Lynch as the spacey Luna Lovegood it finally cant transcend the limitations inherent in being no more than a way station in an epic journey a journey whose cinematic conclusion is several years away.kenneth.turanlatimes.com""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""

"Angry young wizards - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Angry young wizardsWhile not the series best Phoenix boasts fine acting from Radcliffe and othersWhile not the series best Phoenix boasts fine acting from Radcliffe and othersJuly 10 2007|By Michael Phillips Tribune movie criticHarry Potter AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX Hes back and hes hacked off. The most striking aspect of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is its contrast between the hormonally and supernaturally tormented teenager at its center and the modestly well-made and easygoing picture unfolding all around him.FOR THE RECORD - This story contains corrected material published July 10 2007.No. 5 in the omnipresent global franchise ""Order of the Phoenix"" lies at a no-nonsense halfway point between the best of the Potter films (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"") and the most impersonal (""Sorcerers Stone"" which made just under a billion dollars worldwide). Though some of the large-scale effects settle for the familiar the young actors guiding the ongoing J.K. Rowling magic act keep our human interest. We have watched these young actors grow up on-screen and somewhere along the way Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson and Rupert Grint -- Harry Hermione and Ron to millions -- turned into increasingly assured slightly older young actors.I had no particular affection for the first two pictures the ones directed by Chris Columbus which played and felt like hyper-protective producers films as opposed to an imaginative directors. Once those were out of the way though the Potter series became freer to allow each installment some stylistic breathing room within Rowlings parameters and the relative universe governed by a global fan base not keen on surprises.Directed by Potter newcomer David Yates whose resume includes the piquant HBO romance ""The Girl in the Cafe"" ""Order of the Phoenix"" cares little about bringing newcomers up to speed. Nor is the film trying to be the biggest dog on the block. Its gratifying to see a summer picture whose primary impulse is not to destroy the audience even as Rowlings story line nearly destroys Harry by subjecting him to a fate worse than Voldemort teen angst.Harry describes himself as ""so angry all the time"" miserable at home fighting against his darker impulses struggling to act on his better instincts. Thanks to Radcliffe who turns 18 later this month and seems ready for a hardy career once all seven Potter books have been filmed -- already he has appeared nude in the West End revival of ""Equus"" -- our heros ""Look Back in Anger"" phase carries genuine feeling.Rowlings owlishly charismatic hero is returning to Hogwarts for his fifth year. Straight off hes nearly expelled for ""underage sorcery"" while on Muggle turf brought on by an attack of two soul-sucking Dementors working for the other side. Headmaster Dumbledore helps sort it out and gets Harry off the hook but Hogwarts enters a dubious new phase under the stewardship of Prof. Umbridge who has no patience with non-traditional curriculum and imposes a ""Ministry-approved"" set of rules and regulations. The title refers to the shadowy Order of the Phoenix in which Harrys godfather Sirius Black is a member and whose collective eye is on Voldemorts inevitable return.The Potter series has been a reliable employer of half the character actors in England and one of the chief assets here is Imelda Staunton as Umbridge. Her manner of evil -- officious efficiency dressed in various shades of pink -- reminds audiences there is more than one way to get a laugh while striking a threatening chord. Forced into action Harry and his pals Hermione and Ron recruit their classmates to join them in ""Dumbledores Army"" training for a showdown with Voldemort and his slithery allies including Helena Bonham Carter whom no one can accuse of underplaying.Oddly the action climax can be accused of underplaying. The wand-zapping battle is a climax in name only; this is the sequence about 20 minutes in length that is being shown in 3-D at IMAX theaters. I suspect 3-D will help. Working from Michael Goldenbergs screenplay director Yates is more at home with scenes depending on a subtler interweave of live-action and digital concerns. My favorite is an old-fashioned training montage in which Harry Hermione and Ron develop their fighting skills. The scene has a nice shape and rhythm to it and unlike John Williams music for the first three ""Harry Potters"" composer Nicholas Cooper opts not to compete with the amazements on screen.The big wows are familiar but the visual details pack the frame tightly with eccentric crosscurrents of the world as we know it and the non-Muggles land of wizardry. In other words a particularly menacing character may display her decorative china emblazoned with cat pictures on her wall but the meowing cats are actually meowing and moving and acting like real cats.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince stars Daniel...July 14 2009Have Potter films shed books shadow?July 12 2009Harry Potter gets an extra dollop of teen angstJuly 13 2007Harry Potter FilmJuly 4 2000`Potter star says latest film `has to be darkNovember 27 2005Find More Stories AboutHarry PotterDavid YatesTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-07-10/features/0707090953_1_harry-potter-david-yates-rowling,200,harrypotterandtheorderofthephoenix28,harrypotterandtheorderofthephoenix,chicagotribune
"Review Potter Spins More of the Same - washingtonpost.com NEWS | LOCAL | POLITICS | SPORTS | OPINIONS | BUSINESS | ARTS amp; LIVING | GOING OUT GUIDE | JOBS | CARS | REAL ESTATE |SHOPPING ); } //--gt; Review Potter Spins More of the SameBy DAVID GERMAINThe Associated PressMonday July 9 2007; 554 PM-- Harry Potter seems to be living the same school year over and over. And its starting to wear thin.The fifth adventure for the teen wizard ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is another visual marvel yet it suffers from a problem similar to other sequels this summer Weve seen it all before.Or at least weve seen most of it. Sure there are new characters introduced new perils new responsibilities for Harry and his pals and new revelations about the kids early life and connection to the dark Lord Voldemort.And Harry even has his first kiss.Those fresh details aside though and despite a new director and screenwriter ""Order of the Phoenix"" sticks safely and at times monotonously to the Potter formula Show a bit of Harrys drab summer among his heartless Muggle relations branch off into a magical interlude then land him back at Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft where the same old issues resurface _ classmate rivalry teacher trouble and a slow build toward another showdown with Voldemort.Granted this is the formula of J.K. Rowlings books and with fans counting the days until the arrival of the seventh and final novel July 21 the recipe has served the series well.A good deal of the charm of the earlier movies results from the baubles the filmmakers have kept in from the books Odd little interactions with Hogwarts resident ghosts and living portraits some sports action on the quidditch field quirky classroom happenings _ stuff that doesnt really have much to do with the main story.In casting aside most of those trappings director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg deliver the shortest Potter movie yet though ""Order of the Phoenix"" is the longest novel at 800-plus pages.The movie gains in momentum but loses a lot of the fun and wonder of previous installments. Granted the stories grow gloomier as Harrys ultimate challenge approaches in book seven but hes faced doom and death before and still managed to have a good time.An air of calamity hangs over Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) from the outset in ""Order of the Phoenix."" At the end of his interminable summer hes attacked by soul-sucking Dementors then hes expelled from Hogwarts for unauthorized use of magic to drive them off.Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) intercedes on Harrys behalf at a Ministry of Magic appeals hearing. But Dumbledore previously a tender mentor for Harry distances himself from the youth throughout the school year.Harry and buddies Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) face the same old tormenting from classmates. But this time its amplified by scorn for Harry who is branded a liar for insisting that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) had returned to physical form during their battle at the end of the last school year.The magical world is so shaken and divided that the Ministry of Magic assigns repressive teacher Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to the Hogwarts staff to keep an eye on Dumbledore and impart her bland useless ""Ministry-approved"" curriculum.Dolores is all about toeing the line and outlawing original thought leaving the kids without the knowledge and skills they sense they will need as Voldemort and his stooges close in.It falls on Harry to organize and instruct volunteers in a gang they name Dumbledores Army _ Hogwarts students who band together to learn how to defend themselves against the dark forces.One of the most comforting things about the ""Harry Potter"" movies is how Radcliffe Watson and Grint have grown into the roles and advanced as performers. No longer awkward inexperienced children they nicely project both the camaraderie of best friends and the gravity of youths forced to mature far too soon.Some returning characters step to the forefront again notably Harrys godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman who delivers with passion and wistfulness). As always Alan Rickman delights as Professor Snape whose dour disposition and disdain for Harry is explained to a degree.Most other key characters are back including Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson) both sadly underused; Mrs. Weasley (Julie Walters); Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane); and Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson).Staunton dominates the movie with her perky facade and underlying cruelty. Shes a perfect pillar of duplicity and self-righteousness whose aims and methods inject a bit of McCarthyism into Hogwarts.Helena Bonham Carter makes the most of a brief appearance as deliriously fiendish Voldemort ally Bellatrix Lestrange. Also new to the show is Evanna Lynch as spacey student Luna Lovegood.Much of the movie is a setup for things to come and an explanation of things that came before _ personal histories disclosures and prophecies hints of an unholy bond between Harry and Voldemort.At times ""Order of the Phoenix"" is as dry as studying Latin grammar by rote. A climactic tussle between Harry and Voldemorts forces is among the most impressive visual creations in the ""Harry Potter"" flicks; yet dramatically its mostly another tease in their endless grudge match.Familiarity is not quite breeding contempt for Harry and his friends and enemies. But its starting to breed indifference.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images.

Click on the photo to see the gallery. BY Colin Bertramdaily News Staff Writer Saturday July 14 2007 705 PM Its action-packed darker more epic and thankfully schmaltz-free. And its the best ""Harry Potter"" film yet. Like many 30-something adults I was slow to join the Hogwarts phenomenon. If not for a 14-hour flight and an understocked airport book store the adventures of Harry Potter might have passed me by. But they didnt. And unless you live under a rock there will be no escaping Pottermania over the next two weeks. First theres the opening Wednesday of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" the fifth film in the cinematic series then the hotly anticipated July 21 release of the seventh and final book ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."" Like many of his fans Harry Potter is growing up fast. And from the first scene of ""Phoenix"" - our hero sits grimly on a childs swing surrounded by parched earth - its obvious that the next two hours and 18 minutes are not going to be childs play. Harry (a much more mature and confident Daniel Radcliffe) has spent a long lonely summer with his relatives back in the land of Muggles. But all that teenage introspection is abruptly brought to an end when Harry and his cousin Dudley are attacked by dementors - evil life-sucking apparitions not usually found outside the walls of the wizard prison Azkaban. After saving himself and his odious relative Harry is charged with using magic outside of school and is to be expelled from Hogwarts. But those who saw the previous film ""The Goblet of Fire"" know an even bigger problem is afoot. Harrys nemesis the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned to flesh and blood form and wants to take over the world. Pity nobody believes it. A smear campaign by the Ministry of Magic leaves Harry and Professor Dumbledore (an always excellent Michael Gambon) branded as liars and those wishing to fight Voldemort and his growing band of followers are driven underground. Harry is soon back at school - but even the safe haven of Hogwarts is now under threat. Enter Dolores Umbridge dressed in head-to-toe pink (and deliciously played by Imelda Staunton) as the new Defense against the Dark Arts professor. Shes also a ministry plant and one of the best things about ""Phoenix."" Think your worst substitute teacher multiplied by 100. With help from friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) Harry secretly begins training a small band of classmates in nonministry sanctioned spells to protect themselves against Voldemorts rapidly growing forces - and ""Dumbledores Army"" soon becomes a thorn that Umbridge must remove from her side. In previous ""Potter"" movies nonessential story lines and silly character set pieces added little but minutes to the films running time. Here British director David Yates (TVs ""Sex Traffic"" and ""The Girl in the Cafe"") keeps the subplots the over-sentimentality (most notably in a crucial death scene) and regular supporting cast (Emma Thompson Maggie Smith Robbie Coltrane Alan Rickman) firmly in check. But die-hard Potter addicts should have no fear about ""Phoenix."" Even as they are swept toward the effects- and action-filled climactic battle fans will rejoice that Yates has distilled J.K. Rowlings broad universe with care and reverence. And of course theres the spellbinding scene of a young wizards first kiss. The magic is definitely back. cbertramnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Dementors attack him on his school break hes threatened with expulsion from Hogwarts and The Daily Prophet the official organ of the Ministry of Magic calls him a liar for claiming that the evil Lord Voldemort has reappeared on the scene. Even Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) seems to distance himself from Harry. Making matters far far worse the smiling pink-clad fascist Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) Hogwartss new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is transforming the school into a joyless repressive prison for Harry and his friends.This description will be redundant to the millions of readers of the fifth installment of Harrys adventures--an 870-page epic that had to shed many pounds to squeeze into a two-and-a-quarter-hour movie. Those who have not read the book however may wonder how J. K. Rowling could have devoted so many pages to what seems on screen the slightest most water-treading of the series. A new screenwriter Michael Goldenberg replaces Steve Kloves and the British TV director David Yates has taken the reins. After the triumph of the last two movies directed by Alfonso Cuaron and Mike Newell this is a letdown. Let me hasten to add that there are delights to be had. Two new members of the cast are particularly welcome Staunton as the horridly cheerful scarily funny Umbridge and newcomer Evanna Lynch who plays the blonde ethereal Luna Lovegood a new ally of Harrys with just the right off-kilter spaciness. Another standout is Gary Oldman as Harrys godfather Sirius Black whose hidden London digs are headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix a secret underground organization devoted to fighting Voldemorts growing army of darkness. And as always Stuart Craigs production design offers endless visual delights perhaps the most notable addition being the vast black-tiled Ministry of Magic buried deep below London where Harry is summoned to go on trial.Radcliffe is clearly willing and able to take Harry to deeper darker places but the screenplay doesnt give him enough to play off of--his newly embattled relationships with Ron and Hermione didnt make it to the screen. Nor do the political subtexts really come alive why is the ministry so adamant in denying Voldemorts existence? Naturally we suspect the worst--that the powers that be are in cahoots with He Who Cant Be Named--but that appears not to be the case. The storytelling seems occasionally disjointed but more important for all the special-effects wizardry that touch of film magic never surfaces. Theres fireworks and action and much swooshing about but this interim installment seems stuck in one nightmarish gear.

The students at Hogwarts leave youthful hijinks behind once and for all in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" Considerably grimmer and grittier than the previous pictures in the phenomenally successful series new entry finds the young charges head-on collision with adolescence taking a backseat to their sober confrontation with unvarnished evil. Pottermania will reach a peak in July with the nearly simultaneous release of the fifth film and the seventh and final book and only commercial concern for Warner Bros. may be that after the second or third week curiosity about the concluding tome could overshadow interest in the film. Extravagantly produced in the expected manner pic nevertheless marks a notable departure in tone from those that preceded it. From the opening scene portents of bad tidings ahead hang over everyone and everything connected to the wizarding world even as the magical establishment insists there is no threat at large in the land. Altered feel this time around stems in large measure from the new blood recruited to push the franchise into ever-darker domains. Director David Yates heretofore known mostly for his television work (and already engaged to helm the sixth film); screenwriter Michael Goldenberg replacing series perennial Steve Kloves; and composer Nicholas Hooper whose vigorously dramatic music uses only a smidgen of John Williams themes make the most decisive difference in steering the focus away from flights of fancy and in-house intrigue in favor of elaborate and sometimes heavy-handed foreshadowing of the inevitable showdown between Harry and Lord Voldemort. Concentrated focus results in an unsettling mood and dramatic scenes of unusual intensity. But condensing the book which at 870 pages is the longest J.K. Rowling has written into the shortest film in the series has come at a price. Many viewers wont at all mind that this is the first ""Potter"" picture without a Quidditch match nor that house elves and cutesy ghosts are largely absent as well. But more serious is the diminishment of the myriad intrigues among individuals and factions that comprise so much of the stories delightfully complicated fabric. Interplay detailing the fluctuating relationships involving Harry Hermione Ron (particularly slighted here) Cho Chang and intriguing newcomer Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) is sacrificed in favor of repeated group scenes of Harry teaching his clandestine band of teenage warriors the finer points of wand work. Classroom scenes are scanted and a sense of the school year passing is minute giving the film a flattened-out feel compared to the wondrous eventfulness of Mike Newells ""Goblet of Fire"" the last and most successful series installment. Current yarn commences at the end of a parched English summer when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe back with a clean-cut look) lands in hot water with the Ministry of Magic for issuing a forbidden curse to fend off an attack by two Dementors. Harrys Inquisition-like hearing where he narrowly escapes expulsion from Hogwarts thanks to the unexpected intervention of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) sets out the central conflict The Ministry refuses to accept Harrys contention that Lord Voldemort is back and in fact is prepared to put all its propaganda muscle into discrediting Harry and Dumbledore. To this end the Ministry imposes one of its own as this years professor of the Dark Arts. Dolores Umbridge is one of Rowlings most delicious -- and resonantly named -- creations; a stout toad-like woman reliably clad in shades of pink Umbridge is a party functionary par excellence a rules-and-regulations fanatic with a whim of iron who cloaks her proscriptive edicts in dulcet tones and manufactured smiles. Imelda Staunton was the perfect choice for the part and unsurprisingly emerges as one of the films greatest pleasures. Umbridge wastes no time clamping down on Harry the other kids and the Hogwarts staff; assuming more power virtually by the day she puts her most outspoken student in painful detention prohibits the learning of practical curses begins firing wayward teachers and ultimately confronts Dumbledore to assert complete Ministry control over the school. In response Harry assembles an underground rebel band known as Dumbledores Army. The intense way these passages are staged lead one to believe they are the scenes that most engaged the interest of director Yates who seems to relish the image of Harry and Hermione as nascent revolutionary leaders. Similarly prominent are Harrys renewed relationship with his beloved godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) hiding away in the secret family homestead in London and his nightmarish visions of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) with whom he increasingly feels a disturbingly strong connection. It gets so bad that he is forced to receive private tutoring from the dreaded Professor Snape whose distaste for the task could not be more pronounced. Until shortly before the end Snape has very little to do but Alan Rickman may have outdone himself; seldom has an actor done more with less than he does here. Climactic showdown between Harrys crew and Voldemorts henchmen led by Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) is strikingly played out in a huge Ministry storeroom filled with shelved grapefruit-sized globes containing prophecies. One such sphere concerning Harry is of vital interest to Voldemort and performing especially well on his behalf is Sirius malignant cousin Bellatrix Lestrange embodied by Helena Bonham Carter with a particularly maniacal glee. It doesnt take much of a leap to connect the ill winds afflicting Hogwarts along with the sweaty anticipation of inevitable conflict with the present situation in the world at large. The metaphors are all implicit and have a lot to do with just growing up and facing unpleasant realities but they increasingly contribute to the feeling of nervousness and unease creeping into the series. It will be interesting to see if general anticipation for the two remaining films holds fast or tails off once the epic series conclusion is revealed in the final book.
