There are a few glaring flaws which well get to but overall this is satisfying escapism. You could do much worse -- heck Im betting you have. Travolta is always at his best when hes playing oddball characters and From Paris with Love is no exception. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is the assistant to the United States Ambassador to France but hes handling the occasional clandestine job for the Central Intelligence Agency. Enter John Travolta as Charlie Wax an operative with a unique way of handling his business. The two are thrown together by circumstance and of course its an Odd Couple scenario. Travoltas Wax is all about flouting the rules doing it his way letting it all hang out. Rhys Meyers is by the book a thinking man reluctant to start too much trouble. The film plays out against the backdrop of Paris with a heavily attended global conference scheduled a few days out to provide tension. To the films eternal credit it doesnt bother too much with setup or logic were simply inserted into a situation where Wax gets to kill a bunch of people. And kill he does with handguns automatic weapons his hands rocket launchers ... well you get the idea. He kills with verve panache and glee. The plot moves along briskly never pausing long to consider pesky topics of morality or justice. The weakest part of From Paris with Love is Rhys Meyers. Though hes a talented actor and Ive loved his prior work his American accent isnt up to snuff here. Hes supposed to be from New York but his voice indicates hes from nowhere especially not the United States. The other issue is that his character James Reece is a drag upon most of the movies early scenes. Its written that way so Rhys Meyers had nothing to work with but you end up wanting much more Travolta action. The other issues include basic logic and a few one-note characters. No dealbreakers though because again youre seeing Travolta causing mayhem every five minutes or so. Still I cant knock From Paris with Love in any meaningful fashion. For a February film its eminently watchable. I would never ask you to check your brain at the door as I figure you need your brain but I would ask you to enjoy the escapist fun presented here. Theres something to be said for not thinking too hard every once in awhile.

Looking like Fu-Manchu in surplus combat gear and not so much chewing the scenery as using it for target practice hes teamed with preppy pencil-pushing office bod James Reece (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) to take down a Parisian drug cartel as quickly and violently as possible. With the story swiftly descending into a series of spuriously linked encounters in which the pair find themselves terrorised by many different ethnic minorities the film is best when examining the unexpected chemistry between its unlikely leads. Cinematographer-turned-director Pierre Morel (Taken) composes the action sequences with the balletic sheen of Hong Kong-era John Woo but its not enough to allow the film to rise above its guilty-until-proven-innocent conception of justice.

James Reece a PA to the US Paris embassy wants to be a CIA agent he gets his chance from a random link in with Charlie Wax played at hands-off cruise speed by a wasted talent John Travolta.

By Peter Rainer Film critic February 5 2010 Save for later Saved Actors Jonathan Rhys Meyers left and John Travolta are shown in a scene from ""From Paris With Love."" Rico Torres/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of What movie features John Travolta as a gunslinger with a startling hairstyle who craves a ""Royale with cheese"" - i.e. a McDonalds Quarter Pounder with cheese? If you answered ""Pulp Fiction"" youre only half right. In the new thriller ""From Paris With Love"" Travolta playing an unscrupulous CIA special agent sports a shaved head. He also has a nasty goatee. Despite the obvious in-joke references to ""Pulp Fiction"" Travoltas leather-jacketed bling-festooned look here mostly reminded me of his biker baddie in ""Wild Hogs"" not a movie I wish to be reminded of.Without Travoltas Charlie Wax cavorting about Paris shooting off his guns - and his mouth - this movie would be much the poorer. Its pretty poor anyway. I realize logic doesnt play a central role in movie narratives anymore especially in thrillers but ""From Paris With Love"" lowers the bar and then some. This is the kind of movie where the only reason things happen is because it says so in the script. Example When an American diplomat in a motorcade is told that a security threat necessitates a change of itinerary she haughtily vetoes the idea - and runs right into an ambush. In these kinds of movies common sense is always trumped by big explosions. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Waxs counterpart is James Reese (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) a personal aide to the US ambassador to France who has a lissome French girlfriend (Kasia Smutniak) and moonlights as a low-level CIA errand boy. Waxs arrival is Reeses first senior-level assignment and before long the two are waist-deep in corpses. (""Waxs playbook is a bit unorthodox"" Reese is warned.) But since this is a movie about squelching a terrorist plot director Pierre Morel working from a screenplay by Adi Hasak based on a story by the omnipresent Luc Besson has no qualms about upping the carnage count. His film is simultaneously timely and sleazy. The timeliness is intended to buy off the sleaziness. (Im not buying.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? From Paris With Love movie review Even if youre not very good at figuring out plots ""From Paris With Love"" wont crease your thinking cap. When Reeses too-perfect girlfriend slips her late fathers wedding ring on his finger you can see whats coming a kilometer away. The big tip-off She proposes to him. This is just not the way things are done in France.Rhys Meyers is always better when hes playing heels as in ""Match Point"" and TVs ""The Tudors"" and here hes just too nice. I realize the niceness is meant to contrast with Waxs shoot-first-ask-questions-later belligerence but the counterpoint feels forced as if the filmmakers were setting up a new ""Lethal Weapon""-style buddy franchise. Just what we dont need.Amid all the mayhem there is Paris in all its faded-light glory. Is the movie worth seeing as a travelogue? Only if you are (a) a masochist (b) a terrorist or (c) desperate. Grade C- (Rated R for strong bloody violence throughout drug content pervasive language and brief sexuality.)

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 05 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Feb. 04 2010 1249PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English From Paris with Love Directed by Pierre Morel Written by Adi Hasak Based on a story by Luc Besson Starring John Travolta and Jonathan Rhys Meyers Classification 14A The one thing thats briefly enjoyable about From Paris with Love is John Travoltas appearance. In a black leather jacket with a shaved bald head and a goatee and a perpetual scarf to hide his jowls he looks like a well-fed pimp or a gay bear. When Travolta first appears in the movie at a Paris customs office screaming abuse at the French officials because they wont let him bring in his case filled with energy drinks it takes a moment to recognize his familiar twinkle. Sure he may be playing a homicidal racist undercover operator Charlie Wax but hes still Tony Manero and the dad from Look Whos Talking Too. These days its often necessary to try to find a way to enjoy Travolta in spite of the movies he chooses. In this desperately unoriginal action thriller - a sort of mash-up of Training Day and Rush Hour 3 - he is b-a-a-d and not just in a hand-slapping Im-down-with-it-brother way. To be fair his campy performance might work if he were on the same page as the filmmakers who are primarily interested in running up the body count. The story comes from producer Luc Besson ( La Femme Nikita The Fifth Element) and is directed by Pierre Morel ( Taken) with spasmodic action scenes and mirthless attempts at comedy. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays a nerdy American embassy aide named James Reece who falls under the mentorship of Travoltas not-so-undercover agent trying to stop a drug ring and a terrorist attack. The Irish Rhys Meyers wearing glasses sporting a sprinkling of facial hair and speaking in a jarring Noo Yawk accent plays the right-hand man for the U.S. ambassador (Richard Durden) but he really wants to be a spy. James lives with his gorgeous French girlfriend Caroline (Kasia Smutniak) in a Paris flat and runs small errands for the Central Intelligence Agency until one night he gets a call to spring a man named Charlie Wax from French customs. They go to a Chinese restaurant where Travolta whips out a pair of Uzis and kills everyone. Theres some connection to the cocaine that begins drizzling through the bullet holes in the ceiling which leads to expeditions to other grubby interiors where Charlie kills many more Asians. ""How many more of them do you think there are?"" asks James. ""My census?"" says Wax. ""About a billion."" He means Chinese people of course but if youre concerned that sounds racist at least its transitory. Halfway through the film the bad guys suddenly turn into Pakistani terrorists. Nor is ethnicity the only indication of disposability; there are also some women of different ethnicities to be shot. Between shootings there are chases and an ongoing shtick where Rhys Meyerss character totters about carrying a Chinese vase full of cocaine. Predictably Paris provides the backdrop of backstreet grit and postcard prettiness. The climax involves a chase scene in which Charlie hangs out a car window with a bazooka trying to pop a terrorist in another car en route to the airport. It should appeal to anyone who has ever struggled to get to the airport during rush hour and if it isnt a video game already it should be.

Asked how many people hes killed that day he ventures 26 for an average of just over one an hour. Movie Information From Paris With LoveRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Pierre MorelActors John Travolta and Jonathan Rhys MeyersRun time 92 minutesMPAA rating R (violence drug use language sexual situations)Synopsis John Travolta puts on his U.S. intelligence agent face and tries to stop a terrorist attack in Paris. Jonathan Rhys Meyers also stars.More movies from GuideLive.comHes too modest. By my count at that point hed killed 32 in the span of about 15 minutes. The count goes over 40 a little later when bodies started bouncing down a spiral staircase like pinballs. And so on. Even by the ultraviolent standards of contemporary shoot-fests the new action thriller from Taken director Pierre Morel blows through bodies and battles at a dizzying pace.The experience is more like watching a video game than a movie. There are some clunky scenes which are to be endured until the next action sequence kicks in to move the story along. And then oh boy its fists-full-of-Uzis time.Just as in many video games From Paris attempts to offset its hyperviolence by framing it within a reality that is cartoonishly rendered. The opening introduces us to Jonathan Rhys Meyers mousy diplomatic assistant stationed in Paris who dreams of being a superspy. He gets his chance when hes assigned to partner with real-deal Charlie Wax (Travolta) whos flown in on some hazily defined mission that alternately involves Asian drug dealers and Pakistani terrorists.This is the latest iteration of a performance Travolta has been giving over the span of several films and a couple of decades the wild-eyed crazy-genius anarchist. From Broken Arrow to Swordfish to The Taking of Pelham 123 Travolta adopts some odd facial hair and a mad-professor speaking style and goes to town shooting bad (or good as the case may be) guys and chewing scenery. For better and worse his more-is-more performance is the only reliable source of entertainment here. A fun highlight He takes a moment on a Paris bench to enjoy ""a Royale with cheese"" the films nod to his Pulp Fiction past-life.Unfortunately in this films variation on Training Day Travoltas King Kong is saddled with Meyers Faye Wretched. Sporting a gratingly fake American accent - the Irish actor apparently developed his speaking style by watching Christian Slaters movies - Meyers is drab and unconvincing as the mouse that learns how to roar. And the script based on a story by producer Luc Besson is overstuffed with action-hero taglines (""Welcome to Paris baby"") and unintentionally hilarious implausibility.As a director of action sequences Morel is an indisputable wizard. But when the bullets and bodies stop flying his latest movie collapses under the weight of its own absurdity. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Starring John Travolta Jonathan Rhys Meyers Kasia Smutniak Richard Durden Melissa Mars Amber Rose Revah Farid Elouardi Director Pierre Morel Release Opened Feb 5 2010  Editorial Review One close shave after another for John TravoltaBy Michael OSullivanFriday Feb. 05 2010With love my eye.Set in the City of Lights ""From Paris With Love"" has as much to do with lamour as say the St. Valentines Day Massacre. Maybe less.Directed with a bang by French filmmaker Pierre Morel (""Taken"") its the story of trigger-happy CIA veteran Charlie Wax (John Travolta sporting a shaved head goatee and earring) and his unlikely junior partner James Reece (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) a desk jockey who has always dreamed of ditching his cover job at the U.S. Embassy for a career in special ops. Too bad hes never fired a gun.All that is about to change quickly. No sooner has Charlie arrived in town than he takes James under his beefy wing -- the one that doesnt have a gun in it -- shooting up half the city in what he explains is a mission to take down a French-based drug cartel.Otherwise the two dont talk much. Charlie comes in with gun blazing and for much of the rest of the movie doesnt stop. After a while I gave up taking notes about the precise nature of havoc wreaked. ""Are there any more of them?"" James asks after one visit to an apartment building resulting in a particularly high body count. ""About a billion"" deadpans Charlie.Charlie shoots people in the face leg and torso dumping several of them photogenically down the center of a long spiral staircase at one point. (Trust me its kind of a nice shot.) Along the way he blows up several cars including his own. The films best action-movie set piece features him with a shoulder-mounted rocket launcher leaning out of a speeding cars window as he pursues a Middle Eastern terrorist down a busy Parisian highway.Terrorist? Turns out the mission isnt really about drugs after all. That will become pretty obvious to anyone after a few minutes but it takes a while for James to catch on.For the longest time the poor sap is forced to tag along after Charlie balancing a large Chinese vase filled with cocaine which James thinks is going to be used for evidence and which Charlie takes a toot from every now and again. Evidence As if Charlie cared about such niceties. The trail of dead bodies he leaves in his wake is for the gendarmes to clean up. Unless of course they also happen to get blown to collateral smithereens.And yeah its all kind of funny in a smirky ""Pulp Fiction"" sort of way. Theres even a joke where Charlie confesses to James his addiction to the ""Royale with cheese"" an insider-y reference to Travoltas ""Pulp Fiction"" character Vincent Vega who famously expounded on the French version of McDonalds Quarter Pounder.In other words its a hyper-violent buddy comedy. If you like that sort of thing -- think ""Training Day"" with laughs -- youll love this.The action is undeniably exciting though perhaps not recommended for people with pacemakers. The dialogue by Adi Hasak from a story by Luc Besson is peppered with catchphrase-ready quips ""Ka-[expletive]-boom"" Charlie cracks after dispensing with his own government-issue SUV via a judiciously placed car bomb.And Travolta who turns 56 this month still makes an appealingly roguish antihero. If the Irish-born Rhys Meyers has to work a little too hard to sound American -- or to geek up his natural sex appeal with bookish glasses -- his paper pusher makes an otherwise effective foil to Charlies take-no-prisoners super-spy.By the end of the film of course Charlie and James have become so much more than mentor and protege. Not only have they come to respect each other but they get to bond over that most intimate rite of masculine passage Jamess first killing. Its really kind of sweet. And in this testosterone-injected thrill ride it plays as the kind of deflowering it is.Come to think of it maybe this is a love story after all.Contains nearly constant violence pervasive obscenity drug use and brief sexuality.

Sporting a Charlie Brown head of perfect bald round ness and a dangly earring John Travoltas ""From Paris With Love"" assassin/ superagent Charlie Wax is the master of whatever the opposite of wisecracking is. Fooljoshing? Lametalking? Flatlining? Asked how many more E-Z Slay villains he expects to present themselves for mowing down Travolta says ""My sense? About a billion."" A cache of weapons inspires him to say ""Ooh come to Daddy."" Providing an explosive finish to one villains career he exclaims ""Welcome to Paris baby"" And upon dispatching some Chinese coke dealers Wax requests the relay of a quip to their boss ""I got a message for him Wax on wax off."" The line is so inept that Travolta spends part of the next scene explaining why we should think its funny. Basic rule of one-liners They shouldnt take eight additional lines to explain. Theres no footnoting in repartee. Tasked with becoming his partner in action-manhood is Reese a chess-playing American desk jockey at the US embassy in Paris. Reese longs for a promotion but has never done any fieldwork more advanced than using chewing gum to plant a listening device in a French officials office. He is played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers doing a sort of nerd-thug American accent that falls uneasily between Pacino and Urkel. This fop -- all David Niven mustache and Eton bearing -- is said to be from East New York. Its the only line in the script thats funny albeit unintentionally. After a few scenes with Wax Reese becomes an expert gunman but remains a sidekick who is neither comic relief nor an equal partner nor even a device for Wax to fully explain to him and the audience whats going on. His main purpose is to lug around a 2-foot-tall Chinese vase full of cocaine leading to improbable scenes such as the one in which baddies divest him of his flea-market ring but fail to notice hes holding several keys of uncut blow. The director is Pierre Morel whose similarly misshapen and frantic ""Taken"" proved last year that audiences are so starved for an action movie in which the bad guys are Muslims that theyll overlook all other flaws. Wax keeps marching into drug dens and mannequin factories and brothels to gun down heavily armed gangsters by the dozen. If his mission is so vast and important why is he the only guy the US sent? Why has he been saddled with an entirely inexperienced partner? War-on-terror budget equals one pro killer one intern? Morels strategy is to speed up the stupid and hope no one cares. So you can sneak a gun onto an airplane by concealing it in . . . a can of energy drink? A villain tries to kill a US official by ramming into her from the wrong way on a highway even though her car is protected by a large motorcade and he has a bomb planted at the meeting to which shes heading. Jobs that should be easy (like tracing a call placed from an ordinary pay phone) prove impossible while the impossible (like finding a car in a few minutes based on the guess that it is probably on or near a highway in the greater Paris region) proves simple. The scene in which we learn that Wax is pursuing not a bad coke shipment but Pakistani Muslim terrorists is played with muddled hazy sound because Reese who is listening to the story is so cocaine-frazzled that he cant focus. The message to the audience is Well spare you the details but just remember there are some Muslims who need to get Waxed. The single tiny twist which arrives an hour or so into the movie but 55 minutes after the average attentive viewer will have guessed it matters only because Wax so ruthless in every other scene is seemingly under orders to be lax for a while and allow things to stretch out. Otherwise the movie illustrates how boring it is to deliver all screech and no suspense takedown without buildup pure slam bam merci madame. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next City of Light tale heavy on racism Read Next City of Light tale heavy on racism Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 17854 How Hillary blew her big moment 10583 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 7306 NYC tourist duped into buying 1M worth of fake jewelry Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"From Paris with Love | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; from-paris-with-love ) From Paris with Love (France 2010) February 04 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Sometimes movies arent about plot and character. Art films can be more about how they look and feel than whether they tell a coherent or engaging story. Musicals can be all about song and dance. And action films can be gauged by how well they mix the adrenaline and testosterone cocktail that movie-goers are expected to imbibe. Such is the case with From Paris with Love a production that views exposition as a necessary evil and dispenses it as quickly as possible so it can get back to shooting people and blowing things up. The movie is intellectually flat but viscerally involving and keeps the pace at such a consistently high level that it can become exhausting. With its wink-and-a-nod approach it recalls some of the campier action epics of the 1980s when icons like Stallone Schwarzenegger and Willis strode across the cinematic landscape sowing death and destruction. Everythings fast and furious the good guys rarely miss and the bad guys rarely hit. From Paris with Love comes out of Luc Bessons factory. Besson is the French filmmaker who makes American action films with more verve than Americans. His movies are usually in English and often feature recognizable Hollywood names. In this case the A-lister is John Travolta who as a kick-ass hero is a little out of his comfort zone but appears to be enjoying it. With a shaved pate he looks a little like Mr. Clean and acts like a melding of James Bond Martin Riggs and Rambo. The screenplay also remembers Travoltas role in Pulp Fiction and plays homage to it with an in-joke that Tarantino buffs will immediately recognize. (Hint guess the characters favorite food in Paris.) This is a mismatched buddy film and follows most of the conventions of the genre. It is told from the perspective of the intellectual newbie James Reece (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who is the assistant to the American ambassador in Paris. Hes in training to be a secret agent but his assignments are bland allowing him to spend his days playing chess with the ambassador and his evenings snuggling with his attractive fiancA(c) Caroline (Kasia Smutniak). Enter superspy Charlie Wax (Travolta). James is assigned to the profane violent killing machine as his driver/partner and before they have known each other for an hour the body count has started to mount. At first it appears that Charlie is in France to take out a bunch of drug dealers who caused the death of the Secretary of Defenses daughter. But thats a smokescreen. His real purpose is to eliminate a terrorist cell before the members can go active and move against American interests in France. The story is far from airtight but its good enough to get the viewer from Point A to Point B which is all thats necessary in what would have been a B-grade action flick had it not been for Travoltas participation. In terms of its attitude and pace Id compare this to The Transporter (also from Besson) and Crank. Neither film took anything seriously and both were propelled by hard-hitting no-holds-barred action. Thats pretty much whats happening here. There is something that passes for a plot twist and while I wont reveal it here anyone who doesnt see it coming isnt paying attention. Travolta chews the scenery with gusto seemingly delighted to have a chance to attack this sort of role. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is buttoned-down although most of what Rhys-Meyers does at least until the end is react (and carry around a vase full of high quality white powder). Theres a priceless scene in a spiral staircase in which his job as rear guard forces him to dodge the bodies Travolta tosses from above - its funny in a macabre sort of way. The chemistry between the two has a little of the Mel Gibson/Danny Glover Lethal Weapon vibe but it isnt as well-developed. Surprisingly considering the limited screen time accorded to it the romance between Rhys-Meyers and Kasia Smutniak is effective. After only a couple of scenes I accepted these two as lovers. Smutniak a Polish-born actress is making her first high-profile film for American audiences. Theres not much more to say about From Paris with Love. Director Pierre Morel generally does a good job with the action sequences although his ""style"" borrows heavily from The Matrix and its derivatives and he occasionally becomes too enamored with shaking the camera. This is Morels follow-up to Taken and unlike the Liam Neeson thriller it makes no attempt to capture any kind of realism. Its pure comic book/popcorn action. If thats your kind of movie its hard to go wrong with this one.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarFri. Feb. 5 2010 Starring John Travolta Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Kasia Smutniak. Directed by Pierre Morel. 92 minutes. At major theatres. 14AArticle Continued BelowWoe to the hapless moviegoer who strolls into From Paris With Love expecting a Gallic tribute to the wonders of love along the lines of Paris je taime. No this offers a less romantic sort of experience in the City of Lights the kind in which the Arc de Triomphe is riddled by stray bullets the Eiffel Tower is lit up by exploding Peugeots and mimes run screaming along the boulevards.Thats because your tour guide is Luc Besson the French producer responsible for reams of similarly hyperbolic action flicks. Last year he scored a major North American success with Taken so its unsurprising to see him re-team with director Pierre Morel and repeat the formula with two other Anglo stars in place of Liam Neeson.The Tudors Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays James Reece a diplomatic aide who works in the U.S. embassy in Paris but longs for a more exciting life as an intelligence operative. He gets more than he can handle when he is assigned as a driver to Charlie Wax (John Travolta) a bald goateed foul-mouthed super-assassin type on a secret mission. Their first stop is a Chinese restaurant that promptly becomes host to the sort of gun battle that got John Woo banned from Asian eateries everywhere. Its also where Charlie orders James to stock up on the cocaine theyll need to stay peppy for the shootouts to come. Over the course of the mission Charlies targets shift from Asian drug dealers to Pakistani terrorists. Indeed From Paris With Love proves to be even more casually racist than Taken which is a real accomplishment. Thankfully it also takes itself far less seriously this being one of those movies in which the characters joke about the ever-climbing body count. Cast in the time-honoured double act of straitlaced newbie and wingnut-who-gets-the-job-done Rhys Meyers and Travolta develop an affable rapport possibly because they both recognize the movie for the trash that it is. Way hammier here than he was as the villain in The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (though stopping short of Battlefield Earth levels) Travolta clearly relishes the opportunity to revive his old ""Royale With Cheese"" joke from Pulp Fiction. Having proven his forte for action with Taken and the parkour-centric cult fave Banlieue 13 director Pierre Morel acquits himself well with the major set-pieces here even if the near-constant barrage of automatic gunfire grows exhausting. The final reel - which involves a bomb plot a bazooka and a Hillary Clinton look-alike - might also feature the most ludicrous climactic scene in any major motion picture since Nicolas Cage put on that bear costume in The Wicker Man. But since it also gives Rhys Meyers time to make an inadvertently hilarious speech about the true meaning of amour maybe From Paris With Love is not so unromantic after all.

For the answer just meander--no need for running or walking--to your local multiplex. Thats where ""Dear John"" based on the Nicholas Sparks novel of the same name will be meandering on its downward path from sweetly tender to terminally turgid. ENLARGE Amanda Seyfried as Savannah in Dear John. Sony Pictures The story begins in the spring of 2001 when a hunky boy meets a golden girl on a picturesque pier sticking out from the South Carolina coast into the Atlantic Ocean. His name is--exactly right--and hes played by the model-turned-actor Channing Tatum. Her name is Savannah--though she comes from Charleston--and Amanda Seyfried plays her as a perfect empath; Savannah reacts with love and understanding to the tiniest twitch of the muscles on his handsome face. This is good because John a special-forces soldier home on leave is not what youd call voluble. In the Nicholas Sparks tradition hes an old-fashioned American archetype strong and silent and combative only in self-defense. But thats good too because the director Lasse Hallstrom working from a screenplay by Jamie Linden treats the lovers first encounters in an enjoyably old-fashioned way with palpable affection and not a trace of irony. Its as if these scenes had been lifted from a World War II love story. He must go back to his unit she must go back to school and they both must be patient until his tour of duty ends in only a year. But 9/11 intervenes John responds to the terrorist attack by re-upping and their love must now be sustained by mail. This is good and not so good. The downside is obvious. Epistolary romance in the movies means listening to letters in voice-over rather than studying live flesh in close-up. The upside is Mr. Sparkss abiding belief in the power of the written word--he wrote ""The Notebook"" which made a really fine movie as well as ""Message in a Bottle."" This film goes so far as to explain in a helpful montage set almost a decade ago exactly how snail mail works You put your envelope in a mailbox--or give it to a fellow soldier--the envelope goes to a post office a machine sorts it and then sends it on its way to the addressee. Whats not good at all is how the story loses energy and interest when Savannah is off screen and John is slogging his way through several low-rent combat sequences. They get together again of course; Mr. Sparks is a specialist in poignant reunions. But Johns prolonged absence has made the course of true love disagreeably bumpy and the perplexities of the hero and heroine are compounded by the limitations of the performances. Though Ms. Seyfried is a lovely actress her inexperience shows in her climactic scenes which arent written very well to begin with while Mr. Tatums stolid reserve decays into dull passivity. A wealth of experience allows Richard Jenkins to transcend the limitations of his role as Johns severely repressed but loving father an obsessive coin collector who manifests symptoms of Aspergers Syndrome. Hes not alone in his struggle to prevail over adversity. Other characters must deal with autism and lymphoma in a movie that suffers from Convenient Disease Syndrome. ENLARGE John Travolta is the CIA agent Charlie Wax in From Paris With Love. Lionsgate From Paris With Love Be forewarned that the title of ""From Paris With Love"" is ironic. Weapons are the only love objects in this action-comedy of chaos (long on the chaotic action short on the comedy). John Travolta is Charlie Wax a loose cannon--and later a loose bazooka--whos a special agent of the CIA. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is James Reese a low-level CIA operative who works out of the American embassy in Paris. James lives a peaceful Parisian life with a beautiful French girlfriend until Charlie bursts upon the scene and makes him a reluctant sidekick. The pretext for the mayhem that ensues is a terrorist plot but the movie is really about pressing Mr. Travolta who does show up for the damnedest paydays into yet another of those gleefully manic roles (increasingly long on the manic and short on the glee) that he did so brilliantly in ""Pulp Fiction."" The director Pierre Morel (he did the hugely popular ""Taken"") stages most of the action at a breakneck--and breakbrain--pace while poking ponderous fun at the conventions of the action-adventure genre. (The script such as it is was written by Adi Hasak.) At one point cocaine rains from the punctured ceiling of a Chinese restaurant. At another dead bodies rain from the top of a spiral staircase. One strenuously extended shootout in a mannequin factory does double duty as an homage to Stanley Kubricks ""Killers Kiss."" Still the action is ponderous too. Mr. Morel is no Kubrick or Tarantino just as Mr. Travoltas caricature of John Travolta is no Travolta. ENLARGE Emma Bell plays Parker in Frozen. Anchor Bay Films Frozen Adam Greens ""Frozen"" explores a tiny idea exhaustively and I mean exhaustively. Three young snowboarders--two guys and a girl--manage to get stranded on a chair lift overnight though it could be longer. No one knows theyre there dangling high above the snow with no way to get down and the lift will be closed until the following weekend. Will they survive the bitter cold plus other perils that the mountain has in store? More to the point will we survive the tedium of watching a trio of frightened kids who say things like ""This is so messed up"" and ""This is so retarded""? In fact Mr. Green a director of low-budget horror flicks has found more for them to talk about--memories of grammar school regrets about dating the worst ways to die. And the terrified trio played by Kevin Zegers Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell find more to do than dangle. But theyre much less compelling than the wolves that lurk below them. Wolves may also have regrets about their dating choices but they keep them to themselves. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD Focus ENLARGE The Letter (1940) If you accept the summary verdict of Netflix which fortunately makes the film available this drama ""stars Bette Davis in one of her nastiest roles."" Its much more interesting than that though and one of Daviss best roles. She plays Leslie Crosbie the wife of a rubber-plantation owner in Singapore. Leslie shoots a man to death and claims she did it in self-defense but a letter in her own hand threatens to prove otherwise. William Wyler directed from a script that Howard Koch adapted from a Somerset Maugham play. With James Stephenson Herbert Marshall Frieda Inescort and Gale Sondergaard. ENLARGE A Letter to Three Wives (1949) Joseph L. Mankiewicz won a pair of Oscars for writing as well as directing this satirical comedy in which three married women on vacation from suburbia receive a letter from Addie Ross the town seductress who claims that shes running off with one of their husbands. Which one? To answer that question each of the wives examines or exhumes her marriage. Theyre played by Jeanne Crain Linda Darnell and Ann Sothern. The supporting cast includes Paul Douglas whos sensational; Kirk Douglas Florence Bates Connie Gilchrist and Thelma Ritter. An uncredited Celeste Holm provides Addie Rosss voice. ENLARGE Letters From Iwo Jima (2006) In one sense Clint Eastwoods film is a companion piece to his ""Flags of Our Fathers"" which dramatized Americas horrifically costly battle for the small Pacific island in World War II It chronicles the battle in Japanese with English subtitles from the Japanese point of view. In a larger sense its the second and artistically superior half of a single epic film that springs from a single act of compassionate imagination--depicting the Japanese soldiers not as anonymous Others but as men who might be but for their faces and uniforms the GIs and officers of American war movies. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Floating Food Forest Arrives in New York City RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Media San Francisco Chronicle From Paris With Love Action comedy-drama. Starring John Travolta Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Kasia Smutniak. Directed by Pierre Morel. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are stupid action movies that are delightful and others that are irritating and often just a thin line separates the two. The best ones cater to an audiences appreciation of the obvious. Such movies are vigorously stupid energetically stupid and surprisingly manipulative Often things get so engrossing that the audience forgets to laugh. Movies like these assume that viewers are not pushovers but rather intelligent connoisseurs of grand action-movie stupidity. ""From Paris With Love"" is not that kind of action movie. Instead of including the audience in on the joke it offers second-rate goods and then tries to slip them by us. It was directed by Pierre Morel whose previous film was ""Taken"" also a stupid action movie but one made by intelligent people for an intelligent audience. ""From Paris With Love"" by contrast is in search of viewers who really dont care what theyre looking at. A few flashing lights a guy playing the kazoo - anything might do the trick. It would be pointless to try to figure out the motives that made John Travolta and Jonathan Rhys Meyers make this movie. All we can do is assess the damage Rhys Meyers plays a low-level diplomat in Paris who is also working as a petty functionary for the CIA. One of the first things we see him do is plant a bug in a French ministers office. Its a morally dubious act at best one typical of lazy action-movie writing. Muddled morality has no place in a movie that aspires to be light fast and fun. In any case everything else is just a prologue to the arrival of John Travolta sporting a shaved head as Wax supposedly the CIAs best agent. Wax is a hothead and Travolta throws himself into the role with comic abandon. His energy is admirable and his comic timing pumps up a dull script. But this Travolta-as-wild-man thing is a familiar trope and to see it carted out in such a mediocre movie is disheartening. You are guaranteed to enjoy ""From Paris With Love"" if the notion of watching Travolta shooting people - or beating them up in slow motion as heavy metal plays - sounds like a great time at the movies. Holes in the script overwrought camera work dialogue thats embarrassing and a plot device thats obvious 10 minutes into the movie - all these are major problems. Yet every one of these things could have been forgiven if only the filmmakers had remembered to do the essential thing which is to give these guys one good reason to be doing what theyre doing. An audience will accept mass carnage from a father who is for example trying to rescue his daughter from white-slave traffickers. But in this film the wacky agent is killing people because he likes it and his young partner is just standing there because he wants a promotion. The movies only possible source of strong emotion the romance between the diplomat and his fiancee is pushed to the side and then rendered ridiculous. ""She never talked about her life"" he says describing their relationship ""and I never thought to ask."" Thats very uncurious for a CIA agent. The fiancee by the way is played by Kasia Smutniak a Polish actress who works mostly in Italy. Then again maybe this whole review has been unnecessary. Maybe just one thing needed to be said to convey the movies staleness and lack of inspiration. Guess the Travolta characters favorite Parisian dish? A Royale With Cheese. You know just like the character he played in ""Pulp Fiction."" ""Pulp"" was a riff on Travoltas screen identity but when filmmakers start riffing on a riff thats pure desperation. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence and drug use.

From Paris With Love movie review Busy French film mogul Luc Besson is actually competing with himself in America this weekend as two of his trademark high-stakes thrillers come to the screen. So action-movie fans have a choice. The art houses are running the small ""District 13 Ultimatum"" which Besson wrote and produced; the multiplexes are showing the studio ""From Paris with Love"" which he co-wrote and produced. From Paris With Love (R) Lionsgate (95 min.) Directed by Pierre Morel. With John Travolta Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating TWO AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains nonstop bloody violence strong language drug abuse and sexual situations. ""District 13"" is a little better. ""From Paris with Love"" though is more interesting -- at least as an example of what Hollywood movies would look like if they had French filmmakers making them. The story of ""Paris"" isnt much more than a situation. A forgettable Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a would-be spy (and glorified errand boy) attached to the U.S. Embassy in Paris; a hugely entertaining John Travolta is the wild-man secret agent hes supposed to drive around on a mission. What no one has told the callow kid though is that this mission involves a no-quarter-given assault on dozens of drug dealers and terrorists -- and that the violent veteran expects his driver to do a lot more than just wait in the car. The sensible partner/crazy partner setup has been a standard American plot since at least ""Lethal Weapon."" Whats interesting here though is the films Gallic -- or at least non-Hollywood -- decision to throw the genres usual restraints overboard. Jason Bourne? Get lost. Travoltas superspy is a foul-mouthed killer who snorts the coke he steals from pushers pauses in the middle of the case to shack up with a hooker and doesnt grieve if a few innocent beat cops get killed along the way. Hes like Denzel Washington in ""Training Day"" -- except Travolta is supposed to be the hero. Nor is there even a nod to audience sensitivities. For the first half-hour the two white spies kill dozens of Asian gangsters; for the next hour they kill dozens of Arab terrorists. An American-made movie wouldve been sure to have at least one token ethnic good guy for ""balance."" This film doesnt have time; its too busy blowing everyone away. You might find that refreshing or you might find it racist but you have to admit its not the usual PC approach. But the movie while directed by Pierre Morel (who directed an earlier ""District 13"" film and went on to ""Taken"") definitely takes the Besson approach. Rude male-bonding eye-catching action fast editing and loud music drive the plot; logic takes a back seat (or sometimes just gets shoved in the trunk). Why for example would any spy agency assign a seriously unseasoned trainee to such an important case? Why would a seasoned agent take on such a liability as a partner (or know as little about him as he clearly does)? And why apart from the obvious 007 nod is the movie even called ""From Paris with Love""? Its about a spy going to France -- and fighting immigrants while hes there -- not about any kind of export or expat. But this is probably giving the movie too much thought. Youll have a better time if you just watch Travolta here sporting a shaved head a goatee and an enormous crepe-eating grin. Its one of his big aint-it-cool performances right down to a ""Pulp Fiction"" joke and demonstrates again what an enormous movie star he remains. Actually if you want to see the real Hollywood influence on this hybrid you need look no further than this Jersey guy. Pick him up shave him bald drop him in the land of ooh-la-la -- and it doesnt matter at all. You can keep your croque-monsieurs. Hes still a huge improbably likable American showbiz ham sharing his love of processed cheese. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

He plays an American spy in Paris who teams up with U.S. diplomatic aide Jonathan Rhys Meyers to foil a jihadist plot and the movie clunks along for more than an hour before a clever late-breaking plot twist gives it a decent jolt. Luc Besson the king of French action pictures produced and wrote the story; Pierre Morel (Taken) directed and screenwriter Adi Hasak contributed the flat dialogue. R 92 min. By J.R.

Joe Neumaier Thursday February 4 2010 337 PM Title From Paris With Love Beginning with its cutesy-derivative title and ending with John Travoltas ugly American act ""From Paris With Love"" oozes immaturity. If it were the brash inventive kind that at least might be fun. But because the story was hatched in the head of filmmaker Luc Besson the movie has the patchwork plotting of grade-schoolers making up a game at recess ""The heros a wanna-be spy He has to hang with a brash superagent And they hunt a drug stash thats connected to terrorists""Throw in uninspired car chases unfunny quips standard-issue gunplay and voila -- instant action-comedy. Yet this sock-it-to-em souffle falls very quickly unless watching Travolta trying on another faux-hip look is considered fun.Travoltas Charlie Wax is a bad-boy CIA operative who loves killin and smashin things. Charlie of course is immediately identifiable as a ""bad boy"" by his gleaming shaved head his goatee and his earrings. Thats not the suave secret-agent style James Reese (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) envisions when hes recruited from his assistants job at the American Embassy in Paris to be Charlies protege.Reese has been doing low-level spy chores and wants to break into the big time. Charlies arrival in the City of Light drags the strait-laced diplomatic aide into the messy world of drug runners suicide bombers idiotic one-liners and cliched odd-couple partnerships.Director Pierre Morel who leapt from the parkour actioner ""District B13"" to last years hit ""Taken"" wraps Bessons story (with a perfunctory script by Adi Hasak) in a jittery junky visual style. The usually interesting Rhys Meyers speaking in a flat American accent is quite bad at looking amazed at all the giant explosions and impromptu shoot-outs and exudes exactly zero credibility when Reese announces he grew up in East New Yorks Cypress Hills Houses which suggests no one used Google before filming began.About the time a major plot coincidence -- sorry plot ""twist"" -- requires serious emoting Rhys Meyers seems as if he might start snickering.As for Travolta he invites the laughs to his detriment. The New Jersey natives twangy threats nearly drove ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" into parody. Here he hasnt got a bead on Charlie beyond all the preening -- its never clear if the guy loves Paris or hates it -- so he falls back on the silly Metallica look and tough-guy shtick.He stalks around a rooster posing as a debauched loose cannon stopping occasionally for a self-referential wink (hey ""Pulp Fiction"" fans Charlie Wax loves Royales with cheese too) or to make ridiculous taunts. His worst is ""You tell your boss Wax on Wax off"" And his delivery confirms what the title of his last movie alluded to -- sometimes old dogs just cant do new tricks.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"From Paris With Love A buddy film gone bad - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs From Paris With Love A buddy film gone bad Posted  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Claudia The preposterously silly and bullet-riddled From Paris With Love is so leaden and obnoxious that it actually makes you long for the John Travolta of Old Dogs. Well maybe thats a stretch. But Travolta overplays his trigger-happy racist sexist character so much that he qualifies as one of the most annoying screen presences ever. This is meant to be a mismatched buddy spy thriller but its hard to imagine who would possibly want to be his buddy. Paris is intended as both an action movie and a comic parody of the genre. But the cliched hybrid goes over like a lead balloon stuck on the Eiffel Tower. The bad guys uniformly are dark-skinned-Asians and at least one of the key Americans is defiantly ugly. That would be American spy Charlie Wax played by a shaved-headed dark-goateed Travolta. Hes bad but hes light-years away from cool. He spouts inane catchphrases like ""Wax on wax off"" the Karate Kid line which when defiantly leveled at a bevy of Asians is nothing short of offensive. He has no discernible relationships with people but gets plenty worked up by weaponry. The bigger the munitions the more passionate he becomes. Another favorite phrase pertains to his affection for his beloved jumbo assault weapon ""Me and Mrs. Jones"" he coos. In contrast Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays James Reese a chess-playing Cambridge-educated American aide to the U.S. ambassador (Richard Durden) in Paris. He has a beautiful girlfriend Caroline (Kasia Smutniak) but they are plagued by bouts of romance interruptus when Reese gets mysterious calls for his low-level CIA services. Hes a small-time operative but yearns to be an agent. Hes not as obnoxious as Wax but hes a damn fool especially in matters of the heart. Travolta and Rhys-Meyers lack any visible chemistry. Then inexplicably theres a tender moment that blossoms between them. Its as if director Pierre Morel suddenly remembered he was making a buddy thriller. Morel more skillfully directed last years Taken which at least offered a new twist on a kidnapping story. Between Adi Hasaks offensive and occasionally laughable screenplay and Morels dull direction the film is a mess. And the actors manage to muck things up even further. Wax and Reeses first assignment is to take down a Chinese drug ring. But their job gets murkier and results in their unraveling a massive terrorist plot. Audiences are likely to figure out a key double-crossing scheme early on. But Reese despite his intellectualism is astoundingly clueless. Hes also insipid. Still his blandness is preferable to Waxs obstreperous bravado and toxic shtick. Travolta appears to be having fun double-handedly wielding firearms and firing a bazooka on a crowded freeway. But that dubious enjoyment doesnt translate in any way to the viewer. Posted E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

""Ill admit his playbook is a little unorthodox"" says one of his handlers on the phone to James Reece (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) a U.S. embassy junior staffer with dreams of joining the cloak-and-dagger crowd.And unorthodox is an understatement. Over the course of a couple of days Wax ingests illegal substances wreaks havoc on restaurants and warehouses liaises with a hooker blows away about 30 people - and runs a couple of red lights while hes at it.Travolta brandishing heavy artillery and bringing on some chopsocky moves is the crazy provocateur of Morels movie and the actor is clearly enjoying himself - even if he might think hes more clever and cool than we do. Rhys Meyers with an American accent and an air of tidy earnestness plays exasperated and befuddled. But ultimately his James jumps into the fray - he has no choice really. ""If you want to be a secret agent man"" Travoltas Charlie tells him ""you have to roll like a secret agent man.""From Paris With Love lacks the dramatic urgency of Taken - theres no fiercely resolute Action Dad fighting off the thugs whove kidnapped his daughter. The story here is straight from Espionage 101 with traitors who are easy to spot and villains who are borderline offensive ethnic stereotypes. But Morel and his crew certainly know how to stage action the fight scenes and shootouts the stairwell pursuits and motorway mayhem are as good if not better than anything to come out of Hong Kong in a long time.And 15 years after Pulp Fiction the Tarantino influence lives on In whats either a nifty tribute or a lame citation of a classic piece of Quentin dialogue (your call) Rhys Meyers and Travolta take a moment off from tearing around town to enjoy a lunch by the Seine And so the younger actor grinning knowingly hands the Pulp Fiction star a McDonalds box with a ""Royale with cheese"" in it.And then the two of them are off again to fire bazookas at some terrorists or something.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + John Travolta adores being John Travolta. He adores himself to smithereens. As if we needed any reminder of this theres ""From Paris With Love a collection of explosions and shoot-outs duct-taped to a terrorism plot. This is the sort of asinine action exercise that needs a star to blow up cars and leap from rooftop to rooftop with gusto. So right about the time that Travolta curses out the Charles De Gaulle customs staff we know this movie has found a reason to be.Its not simply that Travolta speaks. In fact playing a government agent named Charlie Wax he doesnt give his most convincing line readings. Its as if hed only seen the script minutes before the director Pierre Morel said ""Action. But every time he opens his mouth he sounds elated. He looks it too. Travolta struts around the movie with a bald head dyed goatee gray metal hoop in his ear elaborate scarf and many extra pounds. He looks like the illegitimate child of Freddie Mercury and Charles Barkley. Given how much sing-songy smack Travolta talks he appears to know it.Charlie has come to Paris to - well Im not entirely sure since the scope of his mission seems to expand every 20 minutes. The Chinese drug cartel he and his buttoned-up counterpart an agent named James Reece (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) masquerading as a diplomats attache are supposed to bring down turns into a larger matter of international security. The situation lands right at Reeses front feet with a twist that feels borrowed from the John le Carre lending library.Morels directing career began with such outlandish promise. His 2004 chase-picture ""District B13 introduced American moviegoers to French parkour then set the whole movie on fire with a damning xenophobic conspiracy theory. Last years sleeper hit ""Taken had none of that sense of insurgency. Luc Besson wrote and or produced all three of Morels movies and these most recent two just appear to have rolled off Bessons action-comedy assembly line.Working from a story by Besson the screenwriter Adi Hasak splits the difference between intrigue and inanity. The climax involves a bomb a kind of djellaba garment and a speech about love. You have to see it to believe it and Im not saying you should. But if you happen to go and then find yourself debating whether to stay you might want to stick around for the films crowning political absurdity which is that speech and the character to whom its delivered.Or course should you go its almost certain that youll put up with this movie because Travolta has. He knows his way around junk. This is a man who spent the last 30 minutes of ""Staying Alive dancing in only a loincloth and 10 gallons of baby oil. Nothing embarrasses him. So heres Johnny dropping suicide-bomber packs out of windows onto unsuspecting terrorists. And there he is - or his stunt double - pulverizing a gang of Frasian street toughs with his palms and forearms. At some point he even takes a bite from the mythical ""royale with cheese that Vincent Vega went on about in ""Pulp Fiction and it doesnt feel entirely desperate. Charlie Wax is Vincents afterlife.By the time hes hanging out of the passenger side of a speeding Audi with a deluxe bazooka on his shoulder talking on a cell phone Travolta has reached a cruising altitude of cool ridiculousness. Its no loincloth dance spectacular. But what is?Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Most filmgoers probably remember the famous dance scene in Pulp Fiction when John Travolta once the arbiter of cool added to the repertoire of moves that made him a star in Saturday Night Fever nearly two decades earlier. But people tend to forget that Uma Thurmans index fingers had it right in that movie Travolta really was a square a little dim and consumed by panic--about Ving Rhames about ""the Bonnie situation"" about giving Thurman ""the shot."" From Paris With Love the latest (along with this weeks District B13 sequel) from Luc Bessons prolific Eurotrash action factory features a callback to Pulp Fiction but a much different Travolta vastly more confident and aggressive in his hammy bad-assery. Hes about as cool as his suburban biker character in Wild Hogs. With his flamboyant ridiculousness Travolta does however give From Paris With Love a pulse which is more than can be said for the films petulant hero played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers. By day Meyers works as the fastidious aide to the U.S. ambassador to France but he gets his relatively minor kicks doing extracurricular tasks for the CIA like swapping license plates on cars. Meyers catches his big break when Travoltas big-shot special agent comes to town and they partner up on a mission to foil a Pakistani terrorist plot. Meyers quickly winds up in over his head lying to his live-in girlfriend (Kasia Smutniak) and improvising his way through shootouts in the Parisian underworld. Among the more talented in Bessons vast stable of technicians director Pierre Morel (Taken) keeps the usual junky Besson plot (mismatched buddies vague topical references hot women who kick ass) moving forward swiftly and brings the busy goings-on to a close after 90 minutes. And though Travolta has been put on far too loose a chain--an early rant where he tries to force a bag of energy drinks through customs is particularly strained--he helps set a tone of cheery stupidity that makes the film go down easy. (Poor Meyers the straight man has to play the wet blanket in this scenario.) As junky and disposable as most Besson productions From Paris With Love is insomniac viewing coming soon to a 2 a.m. pay-cable slot near you.

Playing Charlie Wax a U.S. special agent sent to Paris to thwart a terrorist attack Travolta is funny and limber and a genuine bad-ass - someone who gets a secret kick out of always being smarter than everyone else in the room. This is Travoltas most enjoyable and energetic performance since Pulp Fiction and Primary Colors and hes a blast to watch. Directed by Pierre Morel who previously made two equally brisk (District 13 and last years Taken) From Paris with Love doesnt waste a second of its 92 minutes. A protege of French filmmaker Luc Besson (who produced the film) Morel has an unusually strong knack for pacing without assaulting you with his editing (ahem Michael Bay). Morel is also shrewd at never slowing down his story with unnecessary exposition. Here you learn everything you need to know along the way. For example the movie introduces James Reece (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) an assistant to the U.S. ambassador who will become Waxs unwilling partner. At first you figure Reece for a nebbish pencil pusher until a scene in which he tries to plant a microphone under a desk with chewing gum that isnt sticky enough. Although hes resourceful Reece is the mirror opposite of Wax - hes a man of words not action - and their odd-couple pairing should have been tiresome and cliched. But here the mismatch leads to some inspired action such as a scene in which the men ascend a spiral staircase lined with bad guys Wax one floor ahead of Reece to clear the way the latter horrified at the stream of bloodied bodies his partner keeps flinging over the bannister. From Paris With Love is also filled with bits of business that youd never catch the good guys of American pictures doing. When the heroes hole up in a brothel to wait for the bad guys to arrive Wax decides to pass the time by partaking of the services offered. For about a third of the movie the pair runs around holding a large vase filled with cocaine. The drug is supposedly evidence but the heroes occasionally dip into it for an extra boost before walking into a gunfight. You know like Red Bull only not. Even the plot of From Paris with Love as simple as the films brief running time implies contains a couple of terrific twists including one dinner scene that would send even the Food Networks unflappable Barefoot Contessa screaming from the room. From Paris with Love isnt anything special and it lacks the furious energy that Liam Neeson brought to Taken. But the movie is a more-than-adequate time filler before the big films of spring start to arrive and it proves theres plenty of life left in Travolta beyond crap such as Wild Hogs and Old Dogs. He just needs the right director to get his mojo going. Posted by Rene Rodriguez at 1129 AM in Film Reviews | Permalink The Miami Herald Copyright 2010 The Miami Herald. All rights reserved.

Its key attraction is seeing John Travolta cackle and badass his way through the role of Charlie Wax a rogue American spy with a shaved head a matching goatee and beetle brows a passion for saying ""motherf--er"" and a tendency to blow away suspects first and not bother to ask questions later. Travolta lets it rip the way he did in Face/Off (1997); he might almost be playing a psychotic gypsy hitman. The actor who keeps slipping into dated look-how-cool-I-am urban street dialect looks happier here as a freak enforcer than he did as a freak villain in The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3. All in all he seems to be having a far jollier time than the audience. The movie has been fashioned in a crudely hurtling style that barely pretends to make sense. On the trail of a terrorist Wax and his partner an American ambassadors assistant (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) tote around a vase of cocaine (why? Because it seems like a nutty-hip thing to do) and the director Pierre Morel (Taken) tosses scenes together as though he were making a bouillabaisse. The movie has a preposterously multiplying body count yet Morel is a brutally unclever action filmmaker When Travolta shoulders a bazooka and leans out the window of a speeding car we can tell each time the film cuts to a stuntman shot. From Paris With Love is so nonchalant about violence and everything else its downright slovenly.

From Paris With Love Bad to fair Director Pierre Morel. Cast John Travolta Jonathan Rhys Meyers Kasia Smutniak. Rating R for strong bloody violence throughout drug content pervasive language and brief sexuality. RELATED From king to spy Jonathan Rhys Meyers has fun Spy movies Spotlight John Travolta If only. Talk about your bait and switch - instead we get a bald John Travolta shooting up the City of Lights as he fights terrorism a guy whose idea of romance is a quickie in the bathroom with a prostitute. Charlie Wax you see doesnt play by the rules. Or maybe he plays outside the lines. Or the rules dont apply to him. Whatever. You know the type - hes a spy that the government doesnt want to rein in because no matter how unorthodox (and dangerous) his methods he always gets the job done. The bad guys can shoot at him with submachine guns all the livelong day and hell never suffer so much as a scratch. Because you know hes Charlie Wax. Yes. ""From Paris with Love"" is just that original. Oh director Pierre Morel who also directed the surprise hit ""Taken"" throws in Jonathan Rhys Meyers as a sort of lap dog who accompanies Wax on his adventures begging for a scrap of action (hell get more than he bargained for). But the mismatched-buddy picture isnt exactly novel either. Meyers plays James Reece who works for the American ambassador to France a fellow named Bennington (Richard Durden) who seems more interested in who is sleeping with whom than affairs of state. (He was after all preceded in the job by Benjamin Franklin.) But Reece has bigger plans. Hes doing extremely low-level work for the CIA on the side - swapping license plates on cars in dark parking garages that kind of thing. His girlfriend (Kasia Smutniak) is happy enough to be kept in the dark about what he does. He suggests that its more dangerous than it really is but he hungers for something more something more exciting. Enter Wax who practically gets off the airplane with guns blazing. No one else is available so Reece has to fill in as Waxs partner. And the fun such as it is begins. As in any good spy thriller ""Paris"" has plenty intrigue surprises double-crosses. And if nothing else Travolta appears to be having a ball in a performance that starts over the top and gets broader from there. Morel unwisely switches to a more-serious tone midway through the movie in a misguided attempt to make it appear to be weightier than it is. Meyers role increases as he learns the ropes from Wax and the story begins to more fully involve him. That means taking time away from Wax who is subdued for stretches. Well as subdued as a man with a rocket launcher can be. ""From Paris with Love"" doesnt really know what it wants to be. Morel would have done better to remember the ""to thine own self be true"" bit and stayed with the dunderheaded shoot-em-up vibe with Travolta having a blast often literally. That might not be much but at least it would have been something. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

This is the basis for director Pierre Morels delicate study in transatlantic manners From Paris With Love a work that recalls middle-period Henry James--I kid. Anyhow James longs for some more adventurous way to serve his country; while waiting to be approved for serious covert operations he plays at spy doing odd clandestine jobs such as planting a microchip in a French diplomats office for some mysterious ""Sir"" who rings him up for favors. If you wonder why James is planting a microchip in a French diplomats office--if you question anything in fact--this is not your movie.Jamess big break comes when hes called up to chaperone a top American field agent in Paris on business Charlie Wax. Wax first encountered delivering a crotch bump and a ""Checkmate muthafucka"" as his goodbye to French airport security is a husky goateed 55-year-old butch dude dressed up in a kaffiyeh and other Urban Outfitters gear with a Mr. Clean bald pate and earrings. A shoo-in part for John Travolta then--most recently seen shouting ""Lick my bunghole"" in that Pelham 1 2 3 remake and making a truly stupefying music video with daughter Ella Bleu for a cut off the Old Dogs soundtrack--here in all his compellingly horrible jivey splendor.Weve heard the line ""Ill admit his playbook is a bit unorthodox"" as often as weve seen an uptight bureaucrat like Reese teamed with a loose cannon like Wax; From Paris lays down the premise and gets hustling. Reese cringes while mentor Wax mows down the immigrant populations of Paris from the 13th Arrondissement Chinatown to the ""Raghead"" and ""Paki"" HLM slums leaving a trail of the extravagantly killed and all-in-good-fun epithets of Don Rickles vintage. (Blazing through a Chinese drug den ""How many more of them you think there are?"" ""Last census? About a billion."") It could be a film for French Jean-Marie Le Pen voters to love--except there are very few signs that a great Caucasian Gallic people had ever inhabited this shoot-em-up playground now but a scenic backdrop for U.S. anti-terror maneuvers. The native tongue is barely heard; beyond an Eiffel Tower rendezvous little advantage is taken from locations; Smutniak a Pole plays the only putatively French major character. Humor revolves around the two things most Americans know about les francaises 1) We ""saved their asses in World War II"" and 2) They like to have sex. (The understanding of America is scarcely greater James reveals that he grew up in the projects of East New York in the 80s--surely the prettiest white boy to have done so.)Morel and producer Luc Besson whose EuropaCorp studio did very well with last years Taken once again glorify the brutal-efficient unilateral Yankee abroad (sometimes played by Irishmen) with his ""very particular set of skills""--or at least show faith in his enduring box-office potential. (Waxs particular skills are being deployed incidentally to foil a terrorist suicide bomb assassination scheduled to mar an upcoming Aid to Africa summit. The buildup makes The Naked Guns plot against Elizabeth Windsor seem like The Manchurian Candidate.) Beyond its self-conscious silliness--Rhys Meyers does an entertaining coked-up act--and screwball pace From Paris offers some rather grim lessons in its few get-serious slowdowns. We learn along with callow trigger-shy James to take no prisoners and to never ever trust a woman When theres a terrorist plot afoot cherchez la femme.Morels action pieces--spark-showering gunfights Travolta neutralizing an entire gang of toughs with his bare fists a rooftop chase a bazooka on the freeway all generally set to chugging badass guitar--are nothing to place him in the upper echelon of action directors but at least he brings in lobotomized entertainment at 90-odd minutes. During the February doldrums this cannot be underestimated.

Its like the early 90s all over again. Nostalgia is on Travoltas mind too. In ""From Paris with Love"" he plays a violent but chatty CIA agent who while bullets fly likes to engage in dialogue that recalls ""Pulp Fiction"" as if written by action film hacks. Its a kind of return to Paris for Travolta who memorably gave his travelogue of the French capital in ""Pulp Fiction."" ""From Paris with Love"" references that too with a wink-wink meal of a Royale with cheese. The Tarantino comparison (not to mention the titles James Bond allusion) only serves to make ""From Paris with Love"" appear all the more slight. The film is directed by Pierre Morel who helmed another spy thriller the surprising 2008 hit ""Taken."" Both were written (this one by Robert Mark Kamen) from a story idea by the French action filmmaker Luc Besson. Like that film which starred Liam Neeson ""Paris"" turns drama stars into stealth deadly spies. Alongside Travolta (Charlie Wax) Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays James Reese an aide to the U.S. ambassador of France (Richard Durden). But Reese is also a low-level secret agent for the CIA. He aspires to higher levels of intrigue and gets his shot when hes teamed with the veteran Wax. The two embark on a manic rampage of destruction racking up double-digit bodies within minutes in a desperate race to prevent terrorists from blowing up ungrateful politicians. The not-so-subtle suggestion is that those who underestimate the terrorist threat or worry too much about protocol risk big trouble. The ceiling for a movie like this is at best Guy Ritchie or John Woo territory - which is to say quite low indeed. But the biggest thing standing in the way of ""From Paris with Love"" achieving even that standard is the laughable casting. The Irish actor Rhys Meyers (""The Tudors"" ""Match Point"") likely has some fans somewhere but his pasty hollow-cheeked look has always seemed more model than actor. But even his defenders would acknowledge hes not quite action movie material. That neednt be an impediment; the fish-out-water is a standby of many a thriller. But in ""From Paris With Love"" his character though inexperienced quickly adapts to the carnage. (He does blink for one pseudo-poetic moment of reflection in front of a mirror.) Reese it turns out is a tough too. Contrary to his manicured appearance he boasts that hes from a hard New York neighborhood. One foresees South Bronx crowds cackling in the theaters. Having more fun is Travolta. With a shaved head a thick goatee an earring and a leather coat with an upturned collar draped by a scarf he resembles a biker from Soho. He throws himself fully into the film but it never feels like anything more than action movie dress-up. ""From Paris with Love"" a Lionsgate release is rated R for bloody violence throughout drug content pervasive language and brief sexuality. Running time 95 minutes.

Presumably pitched as a fusion of ""Training Day"" and ""Crank 2"" -- but ultimately nowhere near as fun as that premise probably sounds -- ""From Paris With Love"" practically strains itself to avoid doing anything the slightest bit innovative or clever. Provided the notion of a jive-talking John Travolta decked out like Rob Halford doesnt prove too large a deterrent a number of undiscriminating action fans will likely fill the seats for this effort from ""Taken"" director Pierre Morel again called upon to salvage one of the slower weekends on the release calendar. ""From Paris With Love"" reps another example of the ways in which action films increasingly mimic videogames. In particular a long shootout that takes place through the innards of a Chinese restaurant is strikingly similar to a setpiece in ""Grand Theft Auto The Lost and Damned"" -- although unlike the film the game shows a degree of wit and an appreciable sense of space. Pic features a somnolent Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Reese an assistant at the American embassy in Paris who lives a dull double-life as a low-ranking errand boy for the CIA. Soon enough hes called upon for his first real-life espionage mission -- and paired with trigger-happy Charlie Wax (Travolta) introduced trying to sneak a suitcase full of energy drinks through customs and five minutes later seen running in super-slow motion while yelling and firing two Uzis at the same time. (Whether he also endorses Axe Body Spray and Mountain Dew is left unsaid.) The script makes little attempt to explain the conspiracy the pair are tasked with unraveling -- midway through the pics villains turn from Chinese coke dealers to Pakistani suicide bombers without explanation -- instead hustling them from bordello to banlieue to the top of the Eiffel Tower. There are certainly moments of intentional humor here -- Reese carries around a large vase filled with cocaine for a quarter of the movie -- but they clash awkwardly with the pics penchant for deadening violence; toward the end one especially brutal moment hardly even registers as a jolt much less a joke. To his credit Travolta hams it up with the kind of laissez-faire irony that might have made the film a tongue-in-cheek pleasure had his attitude extended to the filmmakers. Production values are schizophrenic alternating between stylish compositions and grainy washed-out B-reel while the uber-bombastic score generates a fair amount of unintended humor on its own.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Fists of French Fury To Paris With Love and District 13 Ultimatum bring the pain (eat your heart out John Woo). _ By David Edelstein Published Feb 1 2010 ShareThis (Photo Eric Caro/Courtesy of Lionsgate) The extreme violence of this weeks releases suggests that larky or tragic message-y or escapist things go better with blood. From Paris With Love and District 13 Ultimatum prove the Frenchies have somersaulted over the Chinese in delivering acrobatic action pictures. Their formula is martial arts plus homegrown parkour (or lart du deplacement) which Wikipedia defines as overcoming any obstacle within ones path by adapting ones movements to the environmentthe environment being in this case fire escapes rooftops or any setting swarming with men and automatic weapons. Pierre Morel a former cinematographer and current ace director in the Luc Besson stable made the first District 13 the rousing Taken and now the big-budget From Paris With Love a mismatched-buddy thriller starring John Travolta with a big bald dome and wispy goatee as a gonzo but disciplined American agent and Jonathan Rhys Myers as his by-the-book pointy-headed sidekick. Unlike most bloated modern action flicks this is a hair over 90 minutes and goes by even more quickly. In scene after masterly scene hordes of bad guys turn into blood-spurting pinwheels that hit the ground the instant you manage to breathe out. Exhalations become gasps of amazement. Morel will inevitably be compared to John Woo whom he trounces. He has fewer mannerisms (no damn doves) and a keener eye; his fastest most kinetic shots flow together like frames in a flipbook. When he interrupts that flow for a snatch of slow motion you see the lyricism of a warrior at full extension or the floppy-limbed contortions of a body flung to its doom. The beefy Travolta isnt the first actor to spring to mind in connection with lightning reflexes but hes souped up and limber elated by his own Zen prowess and the choreography is so expert that I never detected the stuntmen substitutions. But Morels drollest scene represents the art of taking away. Travolta bursts through a door at the top of a circular staircase while Rhys Myers waits below as one body after another sails or bounces or crunches past him. Merveilleux Another Besson confrere Patrick Alessandrin takes over in District 13 Ultimatum which reunites Cyril Raffaelli and David Belle as a bald supercop and a tattooed underworld Robin Hoodmuscular compact parkour masters for whom every building is a collection of ladders slides and trapezes for making ones escape. Its campier than its predecessor but its gung ho union of black white and Asian gangs against reactionaries whod destroy them is a virtuosic assertion of punky Parisian multiculturalism. Despite his reverence for the New Testament Mel Gibson will do anything for an excuse to not turn the other cheek. In the brutal conspiracy thriller Edge of Darkness his first acting gig in years Gibson is a Boston police detective who turns vigilante to punish those behind the death of his daughter. This isnt so much a departure as a grim distillation of all that came before. The formula as always is Make Mel Mad Kidnap or kill his kid or wife and he will hurt you. The drama of the past decade has certainly hurt him His face is not so much wrinkled as creviced by rage his Aussie jauntiness long gone. Hes stripped down to pure righteous anger. Edge of Darkness is a meathead revenge picture but its very satisfying. Director Martin Campbell coming off Casino Royale has a style thats blunt and bruising and the shootings are what violence mavens call weti.e. with maximum splatter. The audience goes nuts when Gibson taunts a bad guy and hypernuts when he blows one away. Hes a ferociously committed actor with a gift for making his bad vibes contagious. Go to my blog The Projectionist for longer reviews of the stunning Ajami a mournful tapestry of carnage co-directed by the Israeli Yaron Shani and the Palestinian Scandar Copti One revenge killing leads to two leads to four and no one survives the moral miasma of the Palestinian territories; The Red Riding Trilogy three hideously bleak Yorkshire-set features based on incantatory novels by David Peace in which the bottom falls out of the standard serial-killer policier and would-be do-gooders plunge into a hopeless thicket of police corruption; and Terribly Happy a nifty Danish rural noir that redefines happily ever after as Whats buried in the bog cant hurt you.
