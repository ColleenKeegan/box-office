Entertainment Sandra Bullock And The Case For Flipping More Mens Roles For Women In Our Brand Is Crisis Bullock takes on a role originally slated for George Clooney and the movies more interesting for it. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Sandra Bullock and Ann Dowd in Our Brand Is Crisis. Warner Bros. ID 7193305 The first question from the audience after the world premiere of Our Brand Is Crisis at the Toronto International Film Festival last month was about hair.Sandra Bullocks character in the movie Jane Bodine is a political consultant with a checkered past thats earned her the nickname ""Calamity Jane."" She has the blondish locks with long dark roots of a woman who was convinced to go lighter by some enterprising hairstylist months ago then never bothered to go back because shes been living in near isolation for years and it doesnt matter. Its a look familiar to anyone who colors their hair on a less rigorous schedule than the salon-suggested four to six weeks but it confounded an audience member who wanted to know why the character would look like that when she seemed as he put it to have the money to take care of herself. ""Its called root grow-out"" Bullock answered with an impressive lack of overt scorn. ""All the women in this room know what that means.""Bullock is one of the biggest stars on the planet and in Our Brand Is Crisis she plays a talented amoral professional hired to run a Bolivian presidential campaign and the first thing someone asked her about the movie is why her hair wasnt prettier. You couldnt have scripted a neater encapsulation of how women get evaluated for how aesthetically pleasing they are before anything else especially with producer George Clooney standing right next to her. If Clooney had played the role in which Bullock ended up as was initially planned would it have occurred to anyone to ask him why his hair was gray or why he sported some scruff? Joaquim de Almeida and Bullock. Warner Bros. Scoot McNairy Anthony Mackie Ann Dowd Bullock and Zoe Kazan. Warner Bros. ID 7213440 No he probably would have been asked about the movie though Our Brand Is Crisis -- inspired by Rachel Boyntons documentary of the same name about James Carvilles work in Bolivia 2002 and directed by the unpredictable David Gordon Green (All the Real Girls Pineapple Express) -- is undeniably more interesting for having Bullock as its lead. Were used to male antiheroes often accompanied by women as the nagging moral centers but Bullocks character is a gleeful participant in the fucked-up industry of exporting the most manipulative of American campaigning abroad (that is until Our Brand Is Crisiss terrible failure of nerve). She unsettles an otherwise familiar story about someone whos really good at their terrible job and without the need for someone to stand around wagging their finger at what shes doing.Bullocks role in Our Brand Is Crisis is one of a few this year originally conceived of as male then switched -- like Britt Robertsons Casey Newton in Tomorrowland and Jada Pinkett Smiths Rome in Magic Mike XXL. This isnt a new idea but three over the course of six months suggests a short-term fix for Hollywoods continuing compulsive consigning of women to supporting decorative and reactive roles -- why not reclaim some of the ones people seem to have no trouble writing for men? Its not without challenges -- theres a well-intentioned weirdness to the way that no one in Tomorrowland seems to notice that Casey is a beautiful teenage girl or that shes running around with a middle-aged curmudgeon played by George Clooney -- but Our Brand Is Crisis like Magic Mike XXL tweaks its gender-flipping in a provocative way suggesting that until there are more projects actually created with interesting female characters this is a start. View this image > Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton. Warner Bros. ID 7213447 And Our Brand Is Crisis gets a capriciousness from placing Bullock in a role that doesnt follow the usual beats -- as Jane she staggers through the first part of the film poleaxed by altitude sickness toting an oxygen tank and vomiting sporadically. She hates being touched and had some real problems with alcohol. Shes permanently clad in a camel overcoat that looks a bit like a bathrobe. Like Rachel in Unreal Jane is in a toxic relationship with her work which gives her a rush like nothing else does. She doesnt care about how whether Pedro Gallo (Joaquim de Almeida) is actually the best candidate to run Bolivia (hes not); she cares about winning and her team (played by Scoot McNairy Anthony Mackie Ann Dowd and Zoe Kazan) goes from looking at her askance to looking at her in alarmed admiration.Jane is a mess of a sort who couldnt and shouldnt be solved by a romance and fittingly the closest thing she has to a love interest is a flirty but genuinely adversarial relationship with her old rival Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) whos running the oppositions campaign. The two savor their attempts to destroy one another (""So what are you doing here? I thought you retired or gave up or something"" Pat says in greeting) and Bullock and Thornton are delightfully sparky together. But theres never any thought that Jane and Pat would be suited for anything more long-term than some spontaneous hate sex. No ones going to save Jane but Jane. Reynaldo Pacheco. Warner Bros. McNairy Dowd Bullock and Kazan. Warner Bros. ID 7213465 The whole middle section of Our Brand Is Crisis is a springy satire about Americans playing puppet master in Bolivia while behaving like theyre at summer camp; theres a sequence in which Janes and Pats teams race in buses down a rickety mountain road risking their lives for no reason other than to prove whos faster. The countrys future is turned into a particularly mean color war except in the end the foreigners will go home and the locals embodied by naive intern Eduardo (Reynaldo Pacheco) will have to live with the fallout.Its not the fact that the movie has a conscience thats its downfall its that Jane grows one herself and Our Brand Is Crisis becomes a story of American guilt rather than American awfulness perversely shifting the focus away from Bolivia to the would-be saviors in the process. Its an ending thats so crushingly bad that it feels like it lets down Jane as well as the audience -- Jane who isnt saddled with having to be the moral authority of anything until that point. Our Brand Is Crisis is the kind of movie that offers a look at a great antiheroine but doesnt trust that she doesnt need to be tamed.

The protagonist Jane Bodine a.k.a. ""Calamity Jane"" (Sandra Bullock) has been lured out of retirement by gobs of money and a challenge Can she convince the Bolivian people to elect as president an unpopular arrogant cigar-chomping oligarch named Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida)--who was already president once and bungled the job?A Our Brand is Crisis hits a lot of clunky notes and the end is unforgivably cornball but its still one of the liveliest political black comedies Ive seen in a while. The pacing is lickety-split the talk is boisterous and the cast is all aces. The big reason it works though is that it takes its premise from Rachel Boyntons phenomenal (but little-known) 2005 documentary of the same name. Boynton traveled to Bolivia to cover the activity of a high-priced U.S. consulting firm Greenberg Carville and Shrum in the 2002 presidential race and she had amazing--frankly flabbergasting--access. She showed how American marketing techniques never before used in that region steered a desperate country towards a rich arrogant former president Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (""Goni"") who proved catastrophically out of touch. In my review of the documentary I wrote ""The process of ""framing"" Goni to look like something he isnt could be the stuff of a rambunctious campaign comedy like Primary Colors or for that matter the documentary The War Room... And parts of Our Brand Is Crisis are darkly amusing. But Boynton has done her own framing This campaign is a precursor to tragedy. She opens with footage of an anti-government riot that came less than a year after the election. When the gunfire stops the camera moves in on a boy sitting on the steps of a building his head partly covered by his coat as if hes grabbing a nap. Its only when the camera is on top of him that we see the pool of blood. The image of that boy haunts Our Brand Is Crisis so that the U.S. strategists who do a bang-up job of getting the wrong man elected to the wrong place at the wrong time look like agents of catastrophe."" Well this is the rambunctious comedy version of Our Brand Is Crisis framed by director David Gordon Green and the British writer Peter Straughan not with a dead boy but the personal odyssey of a fictional character. At the start Jane has been out of the consulting game for several years following a traumatic mayoral race. (A heavy back story is subsequently revealed followed by an ever heavier back story to the back story.) She moved to a mountain cabin stopped smoking got sober and started doing pottery. In Bolivia altitude sickness (at 12 thousand feet La Paz is the worlds highest capital) and sickness with the candidate nearly drive her away. Janes sidekicks--played by Anthony Mackie Ann Dowd Scoot McNairy and Zoe Kazan--cant make a dent in Castillos mixture of machismo cluelessness and the kind of self-serving patriarchal worldview that regards Bolivias indigenous population as a bunch of children who dont know whats good for them. Then Jane figures out a hook To make Castillo more attractive than the frontrunner (a young engaged populist who represents hope and change) she has to sell the idea that the country doesnt need someone well likable. It needs a strongman who can handle a crisis. Janes cynicism--she regards herself the candidate and everyone else as a pawn--is so over-the-top that it threatens to derail Our Brand is Crisis Who cares about the election if she doesnt? But the filmmakers invent an antagonist of near-mythic stature to make her lust for a win Billy Bob Thorntons Pat Candy who works for the leading candidate. Thornton is sleek clammy and leering. He takes a room across the balcony in Janes hotel where he can meet her stare undress her with his eyes and psych her out. When she starts giving it back to him--psyching him out--the movie gets really good. Jane gets blasted leaks misinformation vandalizes Candys room and sabotages his candidates rallies the way he sabotaged her candidates. Its great fun. I love stories of politics as theater--the stagecraft scripting wardrobe choices and focus group testing of absurd commercials. All the stupid tricks are here the ones people laugh at onscreen in the context of a film like this but fall for in spite of themselves on their TVs during football games. We know this stuff happens but its still clarifying to see the curtains pulled back. Although Castillos populist opponent doesnt seem to have much integrity (the character does in the documentary) we still know that Castillo has less that hes a dreadful man. We root for Jane to win and feel guilty for caring more about the game than the country. David Gordon Green keeps the perspectives shifting getting lots of good angles on this three-ring circus. His slickness fits the milieu. And while the role of Calamity Jane smacks of Sandra Bullocks branding--the smart but painfully self-conscious klutz whos also a depressive--its a complicated maybe even feminist shtick. Jane is goaded by patronizing men into proving herself in ways shes not proud of. She comes to realize shes better than that. Janes conversion alas is over-broad and signaled from the start. Its yoked to an impoverished Bolivian teenager who believes--despite the angry effusions of his brother and friends in their hillside slum--that Castillo is sincere in trying to bring about economic equality. Thats not just naive to the point of idiocy. It also sets up a Hollywood ending that all but wrecks the movie. Heres my idea for a Hollywood ending People are inspired to seek out Boyntons great documentary which throws a spotlight on one of Americas least-known but most consequential exports. Our sophisticated political flimflam could make more inroads than the Marshall Plan.

"Our Brand Is Crisis | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; our-brand-is-crisis ) Our Brand Is Crisis (United States 2015) October 30 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Our Brand is Crisis is about an election but in many ways it plays out like a boxing movie told from the perspective of the trainer. The cynical satirical edge is entirely appropriate for the world of politics in which style trumps substance and the currency of the day is deception. Victory goes not to the best candidates but to the best-run campaigns. Muck-raking is a tried-and-true tactic but it must be employed with the subtlety of a scorpions sting (with a little mud-slinging on the side). Our Brand is Crisis isnt about the man on the stump making speeches and shaking hands. Its about the people behind the scenes whose agendas rarely align with whats in the best interests of the populace. The place is Bolivia but the strategies and tactics are universal. For most of its running length Our Brand is Crisis doesnt care whether candidate for President Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) is a ""good man"" or a ""bad man."" Hes a figurehead. The purpose of his election team isnt to worry about whether hes the best man for the job but that when the dust settles he gets the most votes. Theyll do just about anything to achieve this and damn the consequences. Of course the other side is playing just as dirty. However the ending is disingenuous and incongruous with its sudden attack of conscience. Loosely based on events that occurred during the real-life 2002 Bolivian election (as related in Rachel Boyntons 2005 documentary) when the James Carvilles DC-based consulting firm was brought in to manage a campaign Our Brand Is Crisis never lacks verisimilitude. When the movie opens would-be-President Castillo is 30 points down in the polls. Retired political strategist ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine (Sandra Bullock) is pulled out of semi-seclusion to go to work resurrecting Castillos campaign. This pits her against her long-time rival Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton). Her solution is to invent a crisis and turn her candidates numerous negatives into selling points. The approach gains traction but Candy isnt about to give up without a fight and things in the trenches get nasty. Jane is a fascinating character - world-weary and beaten down by past losses she nevertheless proves her worth almost immediately with equal parts cold calculation and irreverent charm. The campaign trail is her drug of choice and it mixes well with the cigarettes she puffs and the booze she swallows. Her past relationship with Candy is shrouded in mystery. Her personal narrative paints her as the victim of a particularly heinous dirty trick but a conversation puts that in doubt. Were never sure what to make of Jane just as were not sure what to make of an attorney defending a monstrous criminal.  Is she amoral or immoral? The longer the film avoids answering the question the more engaging it is. Sandra Bullock has always been likeable but for much of her career she appeared in light fare. Even her Oscar-winning turn in The Blind Side failed to take her in new or interesting directions. That changed with Gravity her first opportunity to break out and really act. In Our Brand is Crisis she gets to go dark without appearing to. Bullock is effective because we find ourselves rooting for her even though we probably shouldnt be. Likewise Billy Bob Thorntons inherent creepiness brings something unsettling to Candy even though hes probably not as unpleasant as we think. These are two good actors playing off one another as well as they play off our expectations. Our Brand is Crisis is fiction but when one considers the current state of American politics theres nothing that feels exaggerated whether its planting a negative story about ones own candidate or tricking an opponent into quoting a Nazi. The movie is funny enough to get its share of laughs but in its angry heart its a tragedy - and the saddest part is that too much of this story is true. Not factual but true nonetheless. The ending is a misstep - an attempt to rescue the movie from the spiral of cynicism. For director David Gordon Green and screenwriter Peter Straughan however this tone-deaf mistake doesnt undo this compelling behind-the-scenes peek at how buffoons get elected and men of substance become political roadkill.

"Brand Echh Sandra Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton Cant Save the Lame Our Brand Is Crisis << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Brand Echh Sandra Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton Cant Save the Lame Our Brand Is Crisis Warner Bros. Movies October 30 2015 by Alex Pappademas Facebook Twitter Print If you look at it as another sincere and affectionate cover-band take on a popcorn genre from director David Gordon Green Our Brand Is Crisis almost makes sense. Pineapple Express was Greens ""80s action comedy"" movie Your Highness was his ""sword and sorcery"" movie and this one is his ""Sandra Bullock"" movie. It doesnt find a new angle from which to approach a star whos been eclipsed by a persona the way Green did with Nicolas Cage in 2013s Joe and Al Pacino in 2014s Manglehorn. It just succumbs to Bullocks gravitational pull content to watch her play a medley of her greatest hits -- funny relatable klutz; recovering alcoholic; problem-solving tough broad; and (eventually) white savior -- as a limp political satire unfolds around her. Its the first time Ive watched a David Gordon Green movie and found myself wishing I was in the capable hands of a set-em-up-knock-em-down director like Jay Roach. The story is suggested by true events and by a better movie about those events. In 2002 the Bolivian politician Gonzalo ""Goni"" Sanchez de Lozada whod served as president of Bolivia from 1993 to 1997 ran for the same office again this time with the American political consulting firm Greenberg Carville Shrum in his corner. In writer-director Rachel Boyntons terrific 2005 documentary also called Our Brand Is Crisis we watch as GCS uses crafty American-style politics to get Goni initially a nonstarter as a candidate elected with a narrow 22.46 percent plurality. He doesnt really have the support of the Bolivian people including the countrys deeply disenfranchised indigenous majority and when he makes the unpopular decision to begin piping Bolivias natural-gas resources to Mexico and California through Chile the population rises up in anger. Protesters clash with Bolivias police and armed forces and by the time de Lozada resigns and flees to the United States in October 2003 at least 70 people have been killed most of them civilians. Its a movie about smart people doing deeply cynical things in service of an ostensibly idealistic goal. As head pollster and strategist Jeremy Rosner explains early on GCS is all about ""progressive policy for profit"" which means swinging elections in favor of vaguely Clintonesque pro-globalization candidates on the debatable principle that any countrys poorest people always benefit when the free-market guy wins. The most compelling character in Boyntons film is James Carville blazingly telegenic as always the life of the party in every meeting selling cracker wisdom like magic beans as unconcerned with the specifics of Bolivian politics and history as a coked-up lead singer asking a Cleveland crowd if Cincinnati is ready to rock. But the movies spine is an interview with Rosner who Boynton walks slowly but surely toward something resembling a confession -- that by twisting the campaign away from actual issues and swinging the election for a marginal candidate who lacked popular support GCS was at least partially responsible for the chaos and death that followed. Ever the strategist Rosner expresses his regret in a chagrined yet perfectly noncommittal sound bite ""Its not facts I learned but the texture of peoples political passions and the texture of their sadness about whats been stripped from them."" In Greens Our Brand adaptation Bullock is ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine a burned-out campaign-trail veteran who comes off the bench to settle a score with her old nemesis a cheerfully despicable Carville manque named Pat Candy played by Billy Bob Thornton. We know that Jane is a once-great political strategist who fell from grace because the implausible newspaper headlines in the opening credits (""INCUMBENT LOSS ATTRIBUTED TO JANE BODINE"") tell us so; we know she has no family and no life and hasnt run a campaign in six years because when campaign managers Anthony Mackie and Ann Dowd drive out to her snowy mountain cabin to pull her back into the game they keep saying things like ""She has no kids no family no life"" and ""Six years? She hasnt run a campaign in six years?"" The worst thing about this movie isnt the fuzziness of its politics; its that it assembles pretty much the best supporting cast you could ask for -- from Dowd and Mackie to Scoot McNairy and Zoe Kazan -- and gives them nothing to do but stand around in conference rooms asking dumb questions for the audiences benefit. ""This thing with Candy"" McNairys adman character says at one point. ""Its like they got some Sicilian blood feud going on. Did they used to work together?"" You will maybe not be surprised to learn that Jane and Candy do have a history and that its connected to Janes amoral disengagement from the ideological side of the political game. The tension between them doesnt play because Thornton and Bullock never seem to be on the same page performance-wise; watching them cycle through emotions in their scenes together is like watching two slot machines try to ring cherries. Apart from a thudding moment in which Mackies character establishes his idealistic streak by admitting that he spent time in a Buddhist monastery years ago -- and McNairys perfect creative-class-douchebag wardrobe notwithstanding -- you never really get a sense of who these characters are professionally or as people. If theyre experienced enough to get jobs running a presidential campaign in a large Latin American country they should probably be at least somewhat capable but the movies arc requires them to be thumb-sucking babies about modern politics so that Bullock who drives the narrative has no choice but to rediscover her inner shark and start running shit. The problem with building the story this way is that the point its trying to make about the morality of American consultants exporting U.S.-style campaigning (and American ideology) to foreign nations is at odds with our desire as an audience to see Bullock and the good guys beat creepy old bald Billy Bob Thornton and deliver a win for their faux-Goni candidate played by the great Joaquim de Almeida (Fast Five). It wont win anything but the best movie Ive seen this Oscar season is Denis Villenueves Sicario another movie about an idealistic female protagonist facing the dawning realization that shes complicit in making the world worse. Our Brand is essentially Sicario with a happier ending in which the cynical Janes decision to do one right thing is imbued with the power to zero out her moral ledger -- partly because the credits roll before the bloodshed starts.

Bullocks reprise of her old greatest-hits collection aside ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" inspired by the 2005 documentary of the same name never finds its own footing either. Much of what the film considers fodder for satire like the notion that selling a candidate is just like selling cat food is too familiar to feel revelatory or shocking while characters that start out believable behave in unrecognizably ludicrous ways simply because the script forces them to. See Video Sandra Bullock Pulls Off an Upset in First Our Brand Is Crisis Trailer Bullock stars as ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine a superstar political consultant fried by a string of losing campaigns and living in seclusion skulking around a cabin and making pottery. She gets dragged back into the game by Nell (Ann Dowd) and Ben (Anthony Mackie) who entice her to join their team of operatives in Bolivia where former president Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida ""Fast Five"") is 20 points behind in the polls in his attempt to reclaim the executive office. Needing both barf bags and an oxygen tank to get her to La Paz Jane comes off the plane looking bedraggled and out of it but she soon volleys enough to figure out the underlying problem of Castillos campaign. The candidate is elitist out-of-touch and obnoxious but rather than try to fix him Jane realizes it makes more sense to change the conversation Things are bad and the times are critical and the country needs an unlikable tough guy to fix things. The campaigns brand she decides is crisis. See Video Sandra Bullock Anthony Mackie Admit to Lying to Police During Never Have I Ever on Ellen So far so good especially when it turns out that Janes longtime rival (and onetime lover) Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) is running the campaign for Castillos most notable opponent. As the gringos play mind games -- not to mention a series of escalating nasty pranks -- on each other the horserace is on. If this were a movie that wanted to be a realistic portrait of people who do dirty work and have no illusions about their jobs ""Crisis"" might have had some salient points to make about political theater. (Think of the scene in ""Broadcast News"" where the reporters lob ethical challenges at each other and none of them have any qualms about duplicity or shortcuts.) But no modern audiences arent attuned to honest larceny so instead we have to watch Jane pretend that she doesnt care about the implications of her work until uh-oh she cares so very much. The screenplay also throws in a sacrificial lamb Eddie (Reynaldo Pacheco ""Beginners"") who was held as a baby by Castillo completely (and naively) throws in his lot until a betrayal sequence thats so overdone and unrealistically timed that the movie might as well show the candidate tying someone to a railroad track. Its hard to fit the film inside the oeuvre of David Gordon Green mainly because hes spent his career defying labels having given us everything from the poetic ""George Washington"" to the rowdy and bawdy ""Pineapple Express."" Sadly its all too easy to recognize the handiwork of screenwriter Peter Straughan and producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov who previously collaborated on the similarly unfunny and heavy-handed ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" another film that sought to score political points at the expense of characterization comedy and coherence. Also Read George Clooneys Answer to Hollywood Sexism Rewrite A Lot More Male Roles for Women Bullock to her credit commits to the role even with all of its weird contradictions and out-of-nowhere reversals while Thornton unsurprisingly summons the spirit of James Carville who was one of the main players in the ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" documentary. (Thornton previously played the Carville surrogate in the ""Primary Colors"" movie as well.) Zoe Kazan perhaps because shes playing the character least conflicted about her own nefarious deeds steals every scene she has as Bullocks shadowy aide-de-camp. Greens usual cinematographer Tim Orr makes Bolivia look both gorgeous and menacing giving an otherworldly smokiness and blur to locations as varied as four-star hotels and crowded slums. Even a better political satire would have a hard time keeping up with the bizarrely eccentric vaudeville currently taking place on cable news but ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" cant even come close.

Photo Credit AP / Patti Perret advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two American campaign consultants duke it out in a Bolivian election. Rated R (language mild violence). BOTTOM LINE An uneven mix of cynical satire and breezy comedy. CAST Sandra Bullock Billy Bob Thornton Anthony Mackie LENGTH 147 Sandra Bullock plays ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine a damaged political consultant who comes out of exile for one more election in ""Our Brand Is Crisis."" Before you begin rooting for her though consider Janes chosen assignment in Bolivia -- to tamp down a populist reformer and put a strong-arm senator in power. Her motivation isnt even money but a simmering hatred for her opposition counterpart Pat Candy an old nemesis played by Billy Bob Thornton. In short Jane is not exactly the good guy. ""I could convince myself of anything if the price is right"" she says in a confessional television interview that opens the film. ""Truth is whatever I tell the electorate it is."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Those cynical words suggest that ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" has its knives out to skewer the great game of politics but the movie lacks a killer instinct. When it works its an enjoyably light comedy with fine performances from an empathetic Bullock and a delightfully lascivious Thornton. (They arent Hepburn and Tracy but theyll do.) When it doesnt ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" veers into the kind of insincerity and staged emotions that it claims to be mocking. Directed by David Gordon Green (""Pineapple Express"") from Peter Straughans script (itself inspired by Rachel Boyntons 2005 documentary) ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" cant decide if its a jaundiced spoof like ""Thank You For Smoking"" or an early episode of ""The West Wing."" Shady tactics abound -- phony leaflets whisper campaigns a dead llama -- but they feel like movie-plot stuff. The discussion of polls strategy and Sun Tzus ""The Art of War"" never feels like it comes from within a real campaign bunker. Anthony Mackie Ann Dowd and Scoot McNairy play Janes quirky cohorts but their mercenary mentality makes them difficult to like. Likewise Janes low-polling candidate Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) who has all the warmth of Vladimir Putin and possibly a similar ideology. Eddie an idealistic staffer from the slums (played by Reynaldo Pacheco) rather condescendingly stands in for poor Bolivia itself. Movies29 big movies in theaters this fall Ultimately ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" isnt as hard-hitting trenchant or angry as it should be. It finally addresses issues of poverty and corruption in a melodramatic ending but it hasnt earned the right. In this movie politics still feels like a game. advertisement | advertise on newsday ----- Calamity Jane four of them on the big screen In ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" Sandra Bullock stars as a political consultant named Jane Bodine. And though the movie is set in South America and not the Wild West everyone calls her ""Calamity"" Jane. Here are four women who played the actual rootin tootin Calam. JEAN ARTHUR -- The squeaky-voiced star of comedies like ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" (1936) looked good in Western garb as Calamity Jane in Cecil B. DeMilles ""The Plainsman"" (1936) opposite Gary Cooper as Wild Bill Hickok. 224 MoviesOur Brand Is Crisis trailer JANE RUSSELL -- The well-endowed bombshells comedic assets were also on display as Calamity Jane in ""The Paleface"" (1948) wherein she dupes dimwitted dentist Bob Hope into a shotgun marriage. They were reteamed for 1952s ""Son of Paleface."" Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff DORIS DAY -- The popular girl next door showed off her tomboyish side playing the title role in 1953s ""Calamity Jane."" She also crooned one of her biggest hits the Oscar-winning song ""Secret Love.""

Our Brand a reminder of politics as dangerous game Tom Long The Detroit News 1229 a.m. EDT October 30 2015Anthony Mackie left Sandra Bullock and Reynaldo Pacheco star in the comedic drama ""Our Brand Is Crisis.""(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures / TNS)Timely is a word that fits with ""Our Brand is Crisis."" Fiery hilarious deep -- not so much.Still this semi-comic look at presidential campaigning -- for the presidency of Bolivia that is -- offers some nice behind-the-scenes glimpses of how political sausage is made just as Americas political sausage is sizzling on the fire.Sandra Bullock stars as Calamity Jane a retired political strategist whos lured by an old friend (Ann Dowd) to the campaign of a former Bolivian president (Joaquim de Almeida) whos trying to get his old job back but is way down in the polls. The pot becomes considerably sweeter for Jane when she discovers the front-runners campaign is run by her old nemesis Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton).Janes first revelation is a telling one Her candidate is something of an entitled snob so she decides to build a narrative that will accommodate him rather than try to sell the man himself. Bolivia is in crisis the narrative goes and it needs a strong assured man who can lead. With this new story in hand her candidates poll numbers start to grow.A lot of nifty dirty tricks flow back and forth between camps but director David Gordon Green wanting to hit comic notes also throws in some unneeded antics -- a cliff-dangling campaign bus race a drunken night of vandalism -- that distract from the more serious business.And make no mistake there is serious business beneath all of this as the films violent finale makes clear. All the manipulation and posturing and bloviating eventually put someone in office and that person can do great harm. Its something we Americans need to keep in mind.

JOHN SEMLEY Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 30 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 30 2015 828AM EDT Comments AA Directed by David Gordon Green Written by Peter Straughan Starring Sandra Bullock Billy Bob Thornton Anthony Mackie Classification 14A Country USA Language English An infantile message movie coming 40 (if not 100) years too late Our Brand Is Crisis hammers home the patently obvious message that politics are a cynical game. Theyre also (to use just a few analogies culled from the film) a cynical carousel a cynical war a cynical form of advertising a cynical popularity contest and a cynical bus race around the lip of a Bolivian mountain cliffside. Politicians and their entourages dont necessarily have their electorates best interests at heart. Democracy is a rigged game. Globalization stunts the developing world. Robert Redfords new drama Truth opens Friday. REUTERS news Robert Redford on the murky intersection of journalism and politics Micheline Lantot left Patrick Huard centre and Suzanne Clement in My Internship in Canada a film where politicians citizens and lobbyists go head-to-head tearing democracy to shreds. Entertainment One review My Internship in Canada A political satire with a refreshingly light tone Carey Mulligan portrays Maud Watts in a scene from Suffragette. Local radicals (played by Helena Bonham Carter and Meryl Streep) change Maud into a suffragette during the early feminist movement. review Suffragette A fist-pumping political awakening of womens rights If youre nine years old - and have never seen Wag the Dog or JFK or Blow Out or All the Presidents Men or The Parallax View or any of the countless docs and dramas having to do with the Nixon administration - maybe its all very revelatory. To any adult with an even reasonably functioning brain who has watched CNN or Fox News for more than a combined 30 seconds in their life its a mawkish chore. I mean the idea is at least as old as Machiavelli. This is after all why we call such strategic manoeuvring ""Machiavellian.""Taking cues from the fast-talking spin-doctoring dramas of Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing The Newsroom) as much as D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegeduss 1993 doc The War Room (about the ways in which media-savvy consultants stage-managed the 1992 Clinton campaign) Our Brand Is Crisis casts Sandra Bullock as political strategist ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine. Shes lured out of sober nicotine-free retirement to salvage the campaign of an unpopular politician (Joaquim de Almeida).His chief opponent is a charismatic populist whose own campaign is engineered by Bodines longtime rival Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton cutting a James Carville-ish profile with his Bic-bald head and infuriatingly impish smile). The chemistry between Bullock and Thornton is the films only real merit carried along as much by implications of their previous relationship as the cheesy will-they-or-wont-they tension.Otherwise for 100-plus minutes the film follows the duelling campaign of dirty tricks and misdirection all in service of the guiding maxim that in politics ""Theres only one wrong losing.""The film is loosely adapted from the 2005 documentary about similar attempts by U.S. strategists (including Carville) to intervene in a South American election. That film was hailed as revelatory - some 10 years ago. By now the idea that politics are mean and brutish and nasty is boringly old hat. Netflixs premier drama House of Cards has been wringing turgid political drama (and some steamy sex stuff) from the premise for three seasons now.So in aid of leavening things somewhat hit-or-miss helmer David Gordon Green (the guy behind the affectingly homespun American indie George Washington but also the stoner fantasy comedy Your Highness) and screenwriter Peter Straughan (whose script feels like it was co-authored by BrainyQuotes.com passages about the nature of politics and power) pull a last-ditch left-turn into hopefulness.Eventually exhausted by her own professional cynicism Bullocks Bodine makes a Norma Rae-ish stand joining a protest against the leader she helped get elected. Hope Change Optimism Its all hand-me-down Obama (or Justin Trudeau) stuff that comes off as totally insincere as Bullocks character blossoms from corrupting white devil and noble white saviour. Theres not enough spin doctoring in the world to twist this final move into something saleable.Say what you will about the sneering misanthropic political dramas of previous eras (Blow Out JFK and so on). But at least they came by their cynicism in good faith. The sour taste they left in your mouth was unpleasant sure. But it was also bracing and vital. Our Brand Is Crisis ends up trading only in sugary sweet Pablum and dishonest optimism driving home the message that we can ""fix"" politics one reformed white womans epiphany at a time. Its the kind of film that cant even bother to commit to its own cynicism which makes it the most deeply cynical kind of film there is.

And on several fronts the George Clooney-produced ""Our Brand is Crisis"" starring Sandra Bullock as a damaged ruthless political consultant has absolutely perfect timing. First its election season. Enough said. And second with all the recent discussion about the need for more diverse open-minded casting heres a role that was originally written for a man. Happily in retrospect the role seems like it should have been written for a woman -- for Bullock in fact. Its a thornier meatier role than shes had in a while one that allows her to use her well-honed comic chops while also digging deeper into a complicated very flawed character. As for the film itself directed by David Gordon Green and shot in New Orleans -- but disguised as Bolivia -- its undeniably entertaining but also a conundrum. At times it seems like a funny and penetrating political satire along the lines of ""Veep"" on HBO. (Check out the amusing llama scene. Yes we said llama.) At others its trying to be a much weightier morality tale (Its based on -- or rather ""suggested by"" Rachel Boyntons 2005 documentary of the same name). At moments these two aims mesh well enough; at others the zig-zag effect is jarring. Bullock is Jane Bodine otherwise known as Calamity Jane famous for winning elections at any cost. ""The truth is what I tell the electorate the truth is"" she likes to say. Anthony Mackie Sandra Bullock talk Our Brand is Crisis filming in New Orleans (video) David Gordon Green directs the political comedy loosely inspired by real events When we first meet Jane shes retired from the down-and-dirty world of politics having been felled by a scandal involving the violation of election laws. Shes living in the boondocks somewhere making pottery. She doesnt drink or smoke anymore and says she can finally look herself in the eye. But like the proverbial wizened former cop brought in for one last case Jane is convinced to join the campaign of a failing candidate in Bolivia. Its good money but the real reason she agrees is that an old nemesis Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton channeling James Carville -- who actually did work on the 2002 Bolivian election) is already down there working for the opposition. These two are warriors to the death. Arriving in La Paz Jane confronts a candidate who is standoffish elitist and 28 points behind. (Portuguese actor Joaquim de Almeida is perfect for the role and will be readily recognized by fans of ""24."") After some initial sluggishness (and slapsticky altitude sickness) her competitive juices kick in. More How ""Our Brand is Crisis"" turned New Orleans into Bolivia Observers of U.S. politics will recognize every lesson learned here. When Pat seeks to exploit Janes candidates short temper resulting in the candidate punching a man Jane stops her team from crafting an apology and frames the punch as a sign of his no-crap approach. Its classic spin. Jane gets her guy to doff his suit jacket and roll up his sleeves. His poll numbers rise. ""Our brand"" Jane tells the team ""is crisis."" Convince voters theyre in crisis and tell them how youre gonna save them. The backdrop is the contentious relationship between Jane and Pat. While their byplay is entertaining its also frustrating. We dont learn enough about the background; it would help to know more and sooner. Our Brand is Crisis movie trailer shot in NOLA and starring Sandra Bullock (video) Politics-driven dramatic comedy scheduled to open Oct. 30 2015 It all ends with the election of course but a subplot involving an idealistic young volunteer (appealing Bolivian actor Reynaldo Pacheo) keeps the film honest as it were with an ending aimed at making us wonder what it all was for in the first place. An excellent supporting cast includes Anthony Mackie and the terrific Ann Dowd as fellow consultants. Yet it all rests on Bullock. Shes fun to watch. Check out her priceless final remark in that llama scene. Her brand is Bullock and it works pretty well. Note Jocelyn Noveck of The Associated Press wrote this review. ___________ OUR BRAND IS CRISIS3 stars out of 5 Snapshot Sandra Bullock stars in a dramatic comedy -- set in Bolivia but shot largely in New Orleans -- about a political operative hired to export American campaign strategies to South America. What works Coming as it does in election season its timing is perfect. Also though Bullock seizes the lead role which allows her to show off both her comic and dramatic chops. What doesnt Unsure whether it wants to be a breezy political satire or a weightier meatier think piece it ends up zig-zagging jarringly between both worlds. Cast Bullock Billy Bob Thornton Anthony Mackie Reynaldo Pacheo Ann Dowd Joaquim de Almeida. Director David Gordon Green. Rating R for language including some sexual references.

EntertainmentMovies Sandra Bullock sells her role in unfocused Our Brand is Crisis Originally published October 29 2015 at 300 pm Updated October 29 2015 at 213 pm Billy Bob Thornton and Sandra Bullock portray rival political consultants in ""Our Brand is Crisis."" (Patti Perret/Patti Perret ) Movie review of ""Our Brand is Crisis"" When Sandra Bullock is fully engaged with her role as a hotshot political consultant her performance is incandescent. Otherwise ""Crisis"" loses focus and drifts. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer When Sandra Bullock is fully engaged with her role as a hotshot political consultant in ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" her performance is incandescent. When scenes call for her to dial back on the intensity or when director David Gordon Green puts the spotlight on other characters the picture loses focus and drifts. Set in Bolivia ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" was inspired by a 2005 documentary of the same title. It chronicles the efforts of a team of U.S. political consultants headed by James Carville to resuscitate the floundering 2002 presidential campaign of Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada a former president attempting a comeback after several years out of power. Portuguese actor Joaquim de Almeida plays the candidate named Castillo a lightly fictionalized version of de Lozada who is way down in the polls. There is no Carville equivalent per se as Bullocks character Jane Bodine operates as a gun for hire employed by a consultant team that doesnt seem to have a leader -- a significant flaw that contributes to the unfocused feeling. Movie Review 1/2 Our Brand is Crisis with Sandra Bullock Billy Bob Thornton Anthony Mackie Joaquim de Almeida. Directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Straughan. 108 minutes. Rated R for language including some sexual references. Several theaters. Billy Bob Thornton playing a rival operative working for an opposition candidate has a lean and hungry Carvillelike look -- gimlet-eyed head shaved bald. Ethically challenged and utterly ruthless he functions as a kind of anti-conscience to Jane. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson? Here are their policy positions3 dead 1 injured in Mukilteo shooting  VIEWDoctor who killed partner child in Seattle penthouse gets 49 yearsAP FACT CHECK Misfires in Hillary Clintons speech6 Seattle spots for truly great pizza  VIEWUnlimited Digital Access. 1 for 4 weeks.Green injects him into the story at regular intervals to remind Jane of her failings (theyve faced off in prior campaigns and his candidates have always beaten hers) and to goad her into following her impulses to do whatever it takes to win principles be damned. After a listless start the picture comes alive when Jane her competitive juices flowing delivers a wow of a speech to her client and associates harshly defining the campaigns many weakness and lasering in on a path to victory. Which basically amounts to heavily scripting the candidates every utterance to emphasize Bolivia is facing an economic crisis and only a flawed fighter (he lacks people skills) can overcome the difficulties. The other prong of her battle plan is to undercut the opposition with deviously delivered doses of character assassination. Dirty dealings are done crises of conscience are experienced by Jane. But with all other characters insubstantially drawn and with the theme of arrogant outsiders tinkering with a Latin nations political processes (the consultants dont even speak Spanish) handled with unimaginative imprecision ""Crisis"" squanders its intriguing premise.

She spouts Sun Tzu and Machiavelli quotes at random but shes clear-eyed and not a sycophant which allows her to see through the mess of Castillos campaign. She claims the nebulous threat of ""crisis"" as their brand and the tide starts to turn. When she launches all out war on their competition its personal more than anything else -- she just wants to beat Pat CandyThe team and the film harbor no starry-eyed belief in Castillo as a candidate -- hes basically the Donald Trump of Bolivia a billionaire whos been president once before. The people believe he will go running right to the IMF and plunge their country into a pit of globalized debt. He just might but thats not the point for his campaign team who can only see poll numbers. For Jane its a blood feud played out upon a national landscape that wont have any effect on her real life.Much hay has been made of the fact that the lead role was originally written for a male actor and its to the films credit (and writer Peter Straughan) that it never becomes about Janes gender. Nor is it about the other political fixers gender or race. They are all driven by the same craven political competitiveness that transcends their identities -- for better or probably worse.VISALIA TIMES-DELTA AND TULARE ADVANCE-REGISTERHoliday Movie PreviewJane is a genius but shes deeply flawed and complicated struggling with substance abuse mental illness her own past regrets. That dark underbelly adds depth and dimension to the ironic humor of ""Our Brand is Crisis."" The team laughs drinks and pranks each other to keep their own consciences at bay. Janes real demon is her own existential terror.The film is deeply cynical and theres a fearlessness in that cynicism. This is undermined in the eleventh hour by an implausible change of heart that feels tacked on to please focus groups and give the film a Hollywood ending. While Jane gets the heros redemption shes far more interesting when shes not being a hero.Our Brand is CrisisNow playing Visalia Stadium 10MPAA rating R for language including some sexual referencesFilm facts Stars Sandra Bullock Billy Bob Thornton Anthony Mackie Ann Dowd Joaquim de Almeida Scoot McNairy.

To bring down your asking price the film takes her south of the border where everything is portrayed as cheaper the cynicism the political strategizing the despair and even the redemption. At least in Bolivia concrete things like bus tours factory visits and flyers might still make a difference so director David Gordon Green (Manglehorn) has something to film besides campaign meetings and silly commercials. (That said there are plenty of campaign meetings and silly commercials and the bus tour serves as the excuse for a spectacularly dumb chase scene along a windy mountain road.) If everything was nastier it might have made for a decent black comedy. If something was more heartfelt it might have made for a decent personal drama. But in both the movie and the campaign it depicts cleverness is the order of the day. And cleverness doesnt inspire allegiance. Or emotion.

Bodine comes out of retirement motivated to win the election and beat her career nemesis. VPCSandra Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton star as opposing political strategists in Our Brand Is Crisis.(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Sandra Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton lock horns in over-the-top fashion but as a satire of Americans meddling in international affairs Our Brand Is Crisis is a political misfire.A presidential election in South America becomes the backdrop for director David Gordon Greens film ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) featuring a once-successful campaign adviser (Bullock) getting her groove back. However the movie unfortunately gets stuck between edgy drama and broad comedy and most of the humor lands with a thud unless animals getting run over or an A-list actress mooning bus passengers gets your vote.USA TODAYHollywood flips for gender-swapping rolesPlayed with a mix of sass and venom by Bullock talented political strategist Jane Bodine is hiding out in the mountains and licking her wounds after a string of rather bad defeats. She garnered the nickname ""Calamity Jane"" for good reason and is reticent in getting back to work when approached by an American management outfit trying to get their man Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) elected in Bolivia.Hes 28 points down and not exactly Barack Obama in the charisma department but what piques Janes interest is getting a chance at some revenge against hated rival Pat Candy (Thornton). A James Carville clone brandishing a confident perma-smirk Pat is heading up the seemingly unstoppable re-election campaign of Castillos popular opponent (Louis Arcella).USA TODAYBullock Thornton reveal the real CrisisJane is a hot mess right from the start trying to work with the Bad News Bears of international politics with Pats mere presence causing a constant psychological freakout. But things start to turn around when she gets a plan in order Everything should be presented as a crisis she tells her team and her client and Castillo starts to move up in the polls as the Bolivian people begin seeing him as a strong leader. Meanwhile a young volunteer (Reynaldo Pacheco) gets under Janes skin and helps her move from complete cynic to something resembling idealism.Our Brand Is Crisis is inspired by filmmaker Rachel Boyntons 2005 documentary of the same name that chronicled the involvement of the real-life Carville and others in a 2002 Bolivian election. Instead of leaning into the biting commentary and relevant issues of that story however the new movies fictionalized journey gets too starstruck with its own familiar faces.USA TODAYAnthony Mackie did not endorse Trump Sarcasm is a lost art formRather than digging into the interesting supporting players on Janes team -- including Anthony Mackie Scoot McNairy and especially Zoe Kazan whose oddball investigator seems to be living in a better movie most of the time -- Crisis often defaults to the many faceoffs between Bullock and Thornton.They are fun to watch in Cold War-esque battle with death glares and icy banter being the weapons of choice and their scenes together nicely hint at untold history between them. Its never mentioned -- there is the bigger picture of an election at stake of course -- but a palpable weirdly romantic tension exists between Jane and Pat as if they stuffed each others ballot boxes at least once in the past and now would rather not talk about it.But factor that in with the lack of real message and needlessly lowbrow humor (the suicidal llama is a particularly bad touch) and this unfocused film shows more of an internal identity Crisis than a political one. 6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1Nbvqxg",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/29/our-brand-is-crisis-review-political-satire/74708478/,200,ourbrandiscrisis(2015)13,ourbrandiscrisis(2015),usatoday

Patti Perret/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Entertainment and RatPac-Dune hide caption toggle caption Patti Perret/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Entertainment and RatPac-Dune Billy Bob Thornton as Pat Candy and Sandra Bullock as Jane in a scene from Our Brand is Crisis. Patti Perret/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Entertainment and RatPac-Dune Back in 1993 D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus documentary The War Room made political celebrities out of James Carville and George Stephanopoulos two of the masterminds behind Bill Clintons underdog bid for the presidency in 1992. A decade later director Rachel Boynton caught up with Carville for another documentary Our Brand is Crisis which subtly cast Clintonian tactics in a much less flattering light. By that time Carville had cemented his reputation as a battle-tested political professional and his consulting firm was offering premium services to candidates across the globe. Boynton followed the team to Bolivia where they led a no-hope candidate named Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (better known as ""Goni"") to victory in a contentious election with an exceptionally bitter aftertaste. Boyntons documentary raised some troubling questions about the cynical business of winning campaigns and the dangers of exporting American ideas abroad. But only traces of those ideas survive in the new Our Brand is Crisis a bizarre and misbegotten satire that detours sharply from the documentary--and in turn from the basic reality of what happened in 2002 Bolivia. Director David Gordon Green and his screenwriter Peter Straughan seem to be operating under the assumption that Boyntons film was forgotten or at a minimum that they have unlimited dramatic license. But even allowing them the latitude to keep or discard whatever they like the changes theyve made to the story are revealing--and every bit as dubious as any market-friendly ""progressivism"" that won Goni the presidency. For one theres no analog for ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine the take-no-prisoners strategist played by Sandra Bullock. (The closest equivalent from the doc may be Jeremy Rosner whose soft-spoken calculation could not be further from Janes commanding brashness.) With the firm struggling to gain much traction from its candidate in Bolivia--here named Pedro Gallo (Joaquim de Almeida)--it calls on the reclusive Jane to lead him back from a 20-point deficit even if it means gambling on the volatility that earned her that nickname. Billy Bob Thornton who played a Carville type in Primary Colors does so again in this film as Pat Candy but hes cast as Janes chief nemesis whos consulting the populist frontrunner. So just to recap The Carville type is working for the other side and the hero of the film is a completely made-up character. This is a deeply strange project. Its neither uncommon nor wrong for real-life characters to be folded into composites for dramatic purposes but ""Calamity"" Jane isnt a composite so much as a stock movie type--that of a soft-bellied idealist hidden under a cynics hard shell. (Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca is the classic example of that type done right.) The arc of Our Brand is Crisis is about revealing her idealism but doing so winds up blunting any point the film seeks to make about the folly of American politicos rigging another countrys system. Everything that happens in Bolivia here is ultimately geared toward giving one American reason to believe in politics again. Our Brand is Crisis finds a nice groove in the second act as Jane labors to make an uncharismatic unpopular ex-president just palatable enough to eke out a victory. The dark magic of turning an arrogant globalist into a winning candidate is a political feat that the documentary and the feature acknowledge and its telling that this section of both films is where they have the most in common. Green whose adventures in cinema range from the high art (George Washington All the Real Girls) to low comedy (Pineapple Express The Sitter) plays up the culture-clash comedy of Americans forcing Bolivians to adapt to their system while failing to understand their hosts. In that the candidate and the consultants are made for each other. They share a common arrogance. Making a pure satire out of Our Brand is Crisis isnt a bad idea though even the sharpest moments shrivel in comparison to the caustic snap of Armando Iannuccis In the Loop and Veep. But the film becomes a Sandra Bullock vehicle and while its buoyed by her typical comic aplomb it loses sight of the bigger picture. In that Our Brand is Crisis mirrors the campaign A victory for one person can sometimes mean a loss for everyone else.

Bodine comes out of retirement motivated to win the election and beat her career nemesis. VPCSandra Bullock shines in David Gordon Greens political satire and Billy Bob Thornton is good as well. But the film never finds the right balance between comedy and drama and is too predictable.Sandra Bullock and Billy Bob thornton play political rivals in the new drama ""Our Brand Is Crisis.""(Photo Warner Bros.)Story HighlightsCritics rating 2.5 stars out of 5Sandra Bullock is quite good as political fixer ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine.Billy bob Thornton is also good and they have a nice chemistry but the film lacks bite and is predictable.Sometimes a really good performance is enough to salvage a movie to elevate it above its pedestrian trappings.And sometimes it isnt.Thus despite Sandra Bullocks best efforts she cant make ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" much more than what it is A predictable political comedy that hits all the expected beats and goes sappy exactly when you think it will. There are some funny bits and Bullock really is good. But like one of those also-ran presidential candidates who stick around for a debate or two but everyone knows have no shot at the nomination David Gordon Greens film never distinguishes itself. Its good for some laughs but then we move on.Bullock plays Jane Bodine (nickname Calamity) a political fixer of the first order. She specializes in reanimating dead campaigns and leading them to victory.Or she did until a nervous breakdown or something close to it landed her in a remote cabin in the woods. But in politics nothing is out of reach so political operatives Nell (Ann Dowd) and Ben (Anthony Mackie) arrive and ask for her help in the presidential election.In Bolivia.AZCENTRALZoe Kazan talks about Our Brand is CrisisTheir candidate Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) is a former president languishing in the polls in fifth place among candidates while popular Rivera (Louis Arcella) not only seems unbeatable but has hired his own fixer Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) who happens to be Bodines nemesis having bested her in every election in which theyve faced each other.Plus they once had a fling.Thats part of the gossip that flies around about the two of them. Theres plenty. These are people beholden not to ideals or parties but to winning at any cost. (The film is loosely based on the much darker 2005 documentary of the same name; Thornton here again channels James Carville as he did in ""Primary Colors."")Bodine doesnt even speak Spanish. But she has tricks aplenty up her sleeve as does Candy.  They are so cynical about the process that even their words arent their own -- they constantly quote (and sometimes misquote sometimes purposely) famous political sayings. Its like having a beer with someone who swallowed ""Bartletts Familiar Quotations.""AZCENTRALList of movies opening in fall 2015Gradually of course Castillo fights his way up the polls until its really a two-man race. How does he accomplish this?Bodine fights dirty. She has him talk about a ""crisis"" that only he can be trusted to handle. She along with her team (which includes Scoot McNairy and Zoe Kazan both good as advisers) try to make their arrogant candidate a little warmer and fuzzier.And theyre good at what they do.But is it good for Bolivia?To Bodine no answer is necessary. Theres not even a question. Her only concern is getting Castillo elected. If the aftermath is ugly so be it.AZCENTRALOur Brand Is Crisis (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsBut the film written by Peter Straughan is the sort that demands redemption of some kind. Thats not a spoiler its a necessity. Credit Bullock for selling it.She does a good job of taking us inside Bodines mental state of making far more of the character than the story would require. (The role was originally written for George Clooney a producer on the film but rewritten for Bullock.) She and Thornton have good chemistry as they attempt to out-sleaze one another.But their moments together exist almost as if from another film. Gordon is an eclectic director and he has trouble with the tone here. Its not that cynicism cant evolve into something more useful in film. Its that the reasons should be more convincing.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Review Our Brand Is Crisis pulls punches but Sandra Bullocks in high gear - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Our Brand Is Crisis pulls punches but Sandra Bullock is in high gear Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Like the politicians and political consultants it mocks ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" doesnt completely deliver on what it promises. Nominally a satiric comedy the film is only sporadically effective running out of energy before it reaches the end.To its credit ""Crisis"" directed by David Gordon Green is the rare major studio comedy to have anything serious on its mind and thats because its plot was inspired by an excellent Rachel Boynton documentary that came out a decade ago. Our Brand Is Crisis | Trailer Watch the trailer for the film ""Our Brand Is Crisis."" Watch the trailer for the film ""Our Brand Is Crisis."" See more videos Boyntons remarkable film also called ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" went behind the scenes as a high-powered American political consulting firm -- one that included James Carville -- attempted to guide an unpopular Bolivian ex-president to another term in office.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; As written by Peter Straughan the fictional ""Crisis"" is also set during a Bolivian presidential campaign though this time the films savvy political strategist is a woman Jane Bodine nicknamed ""Calamity Jane"" because of the chaos she invariably brings in her wake.That change of gender is the best creative decision ""Crisis"" made because it opened up a part for Sandra Bullock a practiced farceur and someone with the fearless energy needed to make things funny.Balanced against that however is the films lackadaisical pacing which means ""Crisis"" takes awhile to get into gear.The narrative starts with political operatives Ben (Anthony Mackie) and Nell (Anne Dowd) driving to the remote snowy fastness where Jane lives in quiet pottery-making retirement. No longer burned out by campaign trail excesses she neither smokes nor drinks and claims ""Im better than happy. Im calm."" Toronto 2015 Sandra Bullock and George Clooney on gender switches and butt doubles Glenn Whipp Following the world premiere of ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" at the Toronto International Film Festival Sandra Bullock George Clooney and the rest of the cast and filmmakers took to the stage at the Princess of Wales Theatre and answered questions in a session that careened in tone almost as wildly... Following the world premiere of ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" at the Toronto International Film Festival Sandra Bullock George Clooney and the rest of the cast and filmmakers took to the stage at the Princess of Wales Theatre and answered questions in a session that careened in tone almost as wildly... (Glenn Whipp) Ben and Nell however want her back in the saddle helping them save the campaign of a Bolivian candidate named Castillo (Portuguese actor Joaquim de Almeida) who is 28 points behind the front-runner with 90 days until the election.Jane says no but Ben and Nell have a secret weapon Castillos top opponent is being advised by Janes bete noir a rival consultant named Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton at his most Mephistophelian) who has beaten her every time theyve gone head to head. Game on Jane says game on.Still its not like Jane hits the ground running. A combination of altitude sickness and general lethargy makes her less than completely involved. Until one of Candys patented dirty tricks lights a fire under her.When Jane gets involved the entire film moves into a higher gear. Rather than change the candidate she attempts to change the thrust of the national campaign to fit his strengths. In other words she manufactures a sense of crisis and presents Castillo as a fighter with the best chance of dealing with it. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link With Jane going on the attack quoting ""The Art of War"" author Sun Tzu referencing the ""Daisy"" attack ad that derailed Barry Goldwater and hiring expert dirt-digger LeBlanc (Zoe Kazan) this central part of ""Crisis"" is the films most energetic and entertaining.But just when the film should be increasing its momentum and revealing even more about how campaigns really work it stalls. Like ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" an earlier collaboration between Straughan and producers Grant Heslov and George Clooney ""Crisis"" has difficulty deciding whether its a comedy or something more serious and that indecision proves fatal.Rather than continue in a satiric mode ""Crisis"" gets increasingly fascinated by one of its least-involving characters a young Bolivian named Eddie (Reynaldo Pacheco) whose earnest belief in political democracy leads to some dead-end plot detours. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story The heart of the problem is that ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" wants to have it both ways.

For the most part her charismatic performance does the job rescuing David Gordon Greens movie as she deftly spars with key support player Billy Bob Thornton. Together the Bullock-Thornton duo is greater than the story they are telling. And much better than what director Green constructed around them with the sudden shifts from serious drama to silly comedy and back again. Bullock even moons the camera out the window of a bus (although we assume there was an ass-double who actually dropped her pants for this ill-advised scene). Overall Our Brand is Crisis is a cautionary tale for Americans Canadians and anyone living in a democracy that has been compromised with back-room political deals and campaigns driven by dirty tricks. But despite the power fan-favourite Bullock has on the marquee no one really expect Our Brand is Crisis to roll to a landslide victory in the box office race. American political satires rarely make a significant financial impact even during American elections when public interest is heightened. In mainstream America it will not help that Our Brand also mixes its English-language scenes with some Spanish-language scenes that mostly play with English subtitles. The world in Our Brand Is Crisis is fictionalized with its roots in a real-life election that took place in Bolivia. Peter Straughans screenplay is loosely based on a 2005 documentary film by the same name. Rachel Boyntons doc chronicled how an American political consulting firm engineered a campaign during the 2002 presidential campaign in Bolivia working for an extremely unpopular candidate who gained votes by warning about an economic Armageddon. In the fictionalized version developed by co-producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov Bullock plays an American political strategist named Jane Bodine. She is also nicknamed ""Calamity Jane"" for her wildly uneven record of wins and losses of the past. The character (which was originally written for a male) is distressed and clinically depressed. But the candidates hired guns bring Bodine into the fray as a last-ditch effort to get their guy moving higher in the polls. Bullocks Bodine warms to the contest which is personalized for her because an arch nemesis is involved with the leading opposition candidate. That nemesis is Thornton playing a political strategist named Pat Candy. As with the Americans working the back rooms the names of the candidates are also fictionalized giving the filmmakers the licence to do their own thing. Portuguese actor Joaquim de Almeida plays Pedro Gallo the conservative presidential hopeful backed by Bullocks character. Colombian-born actor Louis Arcella plays Victor Rivera the populist candidate who speaks ""for the people"" and is backed by Thorntons character. Of these two candidates most viewers would probably vote for Rivera. Gallo is obviously a moody jerk. But because of the manipulation of storytelling and how movies work we are invested in the fate of Gallo instead. We are actually rooting for Bullock over Thornton even though logic dictates otherwise. And we also get more involved in Bullocks team because the movie gives us access to other key support players including roles occupied by Scott McNairy Zoe Kazan Anthony Mackie and Ann Dowd. Besides the main presidential candidates the only non-American character given any screen time is a Gallo volunteer played by Bolivian Reynaldo Pacheco. He brings a touch of humanity to the screen. Regardless of our rooting interests the political campaigns here are all dirty. That is the point of Our Brand is Crisis -- that this is the way all candidates are elected. This may be a bitter truth but it is not new news. Yet it is worth repeating even in a satire as messy as Our Brand is Crisis. As for Bullock she has the knack of playing someone who is seriously flawed yet still appealing for her smarts her broken heart and her sharp wit.

Comments click to enlarge Our Brand Is Crisis Video Rated R  108 minutes  2015 Screenwriter Peter Straughan (The Men Who Stare at Goats) has turned Our Brand Is Crisis (2005) Rachel Boyntons fine documentary about U.S. political strategists perverting a Bolivian presidential election into a comedy for Sandra Bullock whose role as a weary Machiavelli in sunglasses and trench coat gives her little to work with but a stream of jaded one-liners. Billy Bob Thornton plays her good-ol-boy nemesis on a rival campaign (James Carville figured in the Boynton movie) but the best performance comes from Joaquim de Almeida as the heroines client a brusque senator unschooled in presenting himself to the public. Producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov made an auspicious debut with Good Night and Good Luck (2005) which dealt with personal bravery during the McCarthy era but this feature with its self-fulfilling cynicism reminded me more of their other electoral drama The Ides of March (2011).

Watching Sandra Bullock as ruthless campaign manager Jane flog her uncharismatic candidate for Bolivias president I snickered at her knowing quips. Asked by an offscreen TV interviewer (the films awkward framing device) to name her inspiration Jane jokes ""When I started in this business my heroes were politicians and leaders. Then I met them."" But then the film ends and the laughter fades. A chill sets in. For two hours weve liked Bullock and her team -- cheered their successes even. Yet they are the worlds boogeymen. And the nightmare is real.Janes character is inspired by real-life wonk James Carville a hero to some who as a partner in the strategist firm Greenberg Carville Shrum flew to Bolivia in 2002 to elect Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada over his progressive opposition Evo Morales. (That story was told in Rachel Boyntons 2005 doc of the same name -- Green and screenwriter Peter Straughan have made their version un-sue-ably fictionalish.)Film Details Our Brand Is Crisis RatingR GenreComedy Running Time107 min. More Info Trailer If its surprising that Carville the grinning grandpa of American liberals would fly south of the equator to sell a man who represents everything he shuns at home thats the point. Jane cares nothing about the platform of Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) her candidate. Like a defense attorney there are evils shed rather not hear. Shes in La Paz for two reasons the paycheck and the chance to defeat rival election genius Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) already there and gloating over his mans 28-point lead in the polls.Related StoriesPrince Avalanche Director David Gordon Green Finds Inspiration in Texas Worst Fire EverThorntons Pat is a Carville clone. Hes all skull and jaw and deep-fried accent which he employs in foul attempts to rattle Janes composure. Cozying next to her at a debate he whispers ""When I get home Im going to spend hours pleasuring myself thinking of you."" Jane wouldnt ever cry sexual harassment; she sees herself as a sexless warrior. Her every other line quotes Sun Tzu Machiavelli Muhammad Ali and er Warren Beatty. The films strongest impression is of her and Pats furtive tribe of traveling ronin -- mercenaries really -- who cross the globe looking for a fight. Bolivia matters today but tomorrow its off to Israel. As for the Bolivians they dont matter at all.Green also has a weakness for seeing the locals as a gullible herd prone to throwing rocks doting over llamas and undermining their own political credibility by surprising candidates on talk shows with dancing bears. Occasionally Green missteps but hes trying to show us the Bolivians as Janes team sees them -- fools. As Scoot McNairy one of her co-strategists along with Anthony Mackie and Ann Dowd groans of the countrys many rural voters winning them over will be as if a U.S. candidate had to sway 200 million Apaches.A few rise above the rabble Young intern Eddie (Reynaldo Pacheco) and his eye-rolling heavy-drinking apolitical friends; a countryside academic who demands Castillo decry the IMF; a man at a focus group who groans at their latest campaign commercial of a sobbing Bolivian child. And theres de Almeidas Castillo -- a performance worthy of a supporting-actor campaign -- whose prim pride is jackhammered away as Jane rebrands him as a pit bull. ""Roll up your sleeves"" she commands and an aide scurries to roll them up for him.Green also spins the camera around to show what the Bolivians make of these Yankees bossy patronizing giants who cant even be bothered to learn Spanish. After an impassioned Big Movie Speech to two dozen volunteers Jane asks how many people understood her English. A few raise their hands. ""Translate"" she shrugs and clomps away. The role needs Bullock Americas switchblade sweetheart to succeed and she gives it all of her sharp ambition and sympathetic brown eyes. She cant quite make Jane human -- the script doesnt give her enough for that -- but she shows us the physical cost for her too as the teetotaling ex-rehab patient begins inhaling booze and cigarettes. (I could do without the destroy-the-witch gag where Jane falls down a flight of stairs and later wheels an oxygen tank around like an invalid.)Our Brand Is Crisis is so cynical that even the likable scenes turn loathsome. No one in the theater will clutch their pearls to learn elections are dirty and Green will ironically have a near-impossible time battling the audiences own cynicism toward such revelations. Perhaps the most cynical thing about our cynicism is how much we abhor watching it. ""We know we know"" we groan buying a ticket to something dumber even as the crisis festers.

Say what you will about our elections but at least our operatives have to live where they work. Just as chilling is Janes brainstorm that the Bolivians protest for a liberal candidate can be used to destroy that liberal candidates campaign. Protest means chaos she argues. And in times of chaos conservative strongmen win.How then can anyone anywhere combat these boogeymen? Only by fighting their apathetic image of us -- which takes arming ourselves with facts passion and hope.OUR BRAND IS CRISIS | Directed by David Gordon Green | Written by Peter Straughan based on the documentary by Rachel Boynton | Warner Bros. | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Stephanie Merry October 29 2015 Follow stephmerry This fictionalized account of the 2002 Bolivian election focuses on the American political campaign strategies used by Jane Bodine (Sandra Bullock) to help elect Pedro Gallo. (Warner Bros.) ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" has all the makings of an awards-season contender Oscar-winning stars (Sandra Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton); Oscar-winning producers (George Clooney and Grant Heslov); stellar source material (Rachel Boyntons acclaimed 2005 documentary); plus a solid director screenwriter and supporting cast. Thats a lot of tasty ingredients for such a bland stew. Bullock at least nails her role as ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine who once upon a time was a talented take-no-prisoners political strategist. But when erratic behavior turned her into gossip-column fodder Jane disappeared into the mountains gave up drinking and became a reclusive potter. Until -- and you knew there would be an until -- Janes former associate Nell (Ann Dowd) and Nells sidekick Ben (Anthony Mackie) track her down. The two need Janes help to get Pedro Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) elected president of Bolivia. The quandary? No one likes him. Hes haughty indifferent and 28 points behind in the polls which is probably where he belongs. At first Jane laughs offering good luck and trying to push them out the door. But then Nell shows her a newspaper clipping. Standing over the shoulder of Bolivias beloved front-runner is Janes nemesis another American political strategist by the name of Pat Candy (Thornton). This means war. The nutty unkempt Jane and her favorite accouterment -- an open bag of chips -- head for Bolivia to take on Candy a slickly tailored stuffed suit. The chemistry between Billy Bob Thornton and Sandra Bullock as rival political operatives isnt enough to save ""Our Brand Is Crisis."" (Patti Perret/Warner Bros. Pictures) Boyntons documentary had a slightly different premise There was one strategist and it was none other than Thornton doppelganger James Carville. Carville helped an unpopular candidate get reelected which in turn sent Bolivia into turmoil. That president Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has been living in exile in the United States since 2003 despite extradition attempts and charges of orchestrating the massacre of dozens of protesters. (Thats American intervention for you.) Boyntons movie effectively blended satire fascinating behind-the-scenes strategizing and tragedy. Here the stakes are more nebulous. Like the documentary the fictionalized version could have focused on the obscure but shocking story of what happens when a bunch of American puppetmasters -- who care more about winning than an entire country of people -- try to make history. Instead the movie turns out to be something weve seen before an underdog tale mixed with a redemption narrative. Admittedly Bullock and Thornton have great chemistry in what is essentially the Jane and Pat show. But that framing raises a question Why bother setting the movie in another country at all? Theres one small sliver of Bolivian perspective in the form of the movies conscience Eddie (Reynaldo Pacheco) a young idealist who actually believes that Castillo will stay true to his campaign promises. Of course any fresh-faced kid with that much earnestness is destined to become disillusioned. That foregone conclusion doesnt make for great drama. Neither does the relative subordination of his story. That leads to another question What exactly is ""Our Brand Is Crisis""? The cheeky score by David Wingo suggests a lighthearted heist film yet all the protesters hurling rocks at Castillos campaign bus look deadly serious. Both director David Gordon Green (""Pineapple Express"" ""All the Real Girls"") and screenwriter Peter Straughan (""Frank"" ""Wolf Hall"") have skillfully dished out comedy and drama before. But ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" cant seem to commit to either. If its satire its neither sharp nor especially funny. Yet it doesnt deliver emotionally either. That leaves just one option a missed opportunity. R. At area theaters. Contains strong language including sexual references.

Rachel Boynton a documentary director whose work focuses on ideology politics and power (her most recent movie ""Big Men"" is about the global workings of the oil industry) came along and made an extraordinary film about that campaign whose title was drawn from a telling phrase coined by one of the GCS consultants.That is now the title of the Bullock movie directed by indie-film veteran David Gordon Green and written by Peter Straughan (""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"") which is also set during a Bolivian presidential campaign and stars Billy Bob Thornton Anthony Mackie Scoot McNairy Ann Dowd and Zoe Kazan as Bullocks rivals or colleagues in the Machiavellian business of reinventing candidates and reshaping public opinion. What makes this fictionalized ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" worth noticing - to the extent it is which isnt much - is that the filmmakers probably believe they are delivering roughly the same message as Boyntons documentary did but in fact the most important aspects of this striking story has been scrubbed away or laundered into Hollywood-style pseudo-psychological neutrality.This movie offers us the tale of the fall and redemption of an unscrupulous white lady -- who we know cannot really be unscrupulous since shes Sandra Bullock. Although I hasten to add that even by the standards of Bullocks implacable steel-jawed underacting this is a dull performance. Around the edges of this story about Bullocks character an especially ruthless consultant known as Calamity Jane there are a few intriguing hints of other stories about the international financial system the power of fear in politics and the American understanding of what democracy means when applied to other people in other countries. ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" is being released by Warner Bros. but was largely funded by Participant Media which produces what it calls ""socially relevant films and documentaries."" In other words in this case the right-wingers are correct ""Liberal Hollywood"" is in full effect.Yet you really have to read between the lines and dig into the subtext of Straughans screenplay to perceive the issues that drove Boyntons film. What the hell was James Carville and Stan Greenbergs consulting firm - with its close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party leadership class - doing in one of South Americas smallest and poorest nations? Who was really paying for their work with Goni an unpopular former president who had spent much of his life in the United States and spoke Spanish so poorly that Bolivian opponents derided him as ""El Gringo""?I get it -- Green and Straughan and Participant were trying to make a Sandra Bullock movie that Warner Bros. can put onto thousands of theater screens. So those questions remain in the dim and dusty background behind the quasi-hilarious dirty tricks the long nights of booze the almost-condescending interactions with indigenous Bolivians and the rivalrous relationship - tinged with both tragedy and Eros - between Jane and Thorntons Mephistophelean (and distinctly Carville-like) Pat Candy. Yes this is a movie where a diabolical character is given the surname Candy and what can you really say? All this makes for mid-grade entertainment value at best. And in the real Bolivian election of 02 there was no rivalry between warring American spin doctors working for different candidates because Goni was the only candidate who got that kind of help in clear preference to his populist opponents on both the right and left. You Might Also Like For people who want the vastly more interesting real history of Americas misbegotten meddling in Bolivia - just one chapter of course in a much larger global story - Boyntons film is out there and so is what happened later. Goni was in effect the candidate of the ""Washington consensus"" the guy who would bring a small fractious and deeply divided country into the established international economic order. As president in the mid-90s he had pursued a controversial two-level strategy extending constitutional rights and policy reforms aimed at Bolivias large indigenous population while also embarking on a widespread campaign of privatization that sold off state-owned industries and natural resources to foreign capital. As it happens - and Im sure all this is coincidental - Bolivia contains immense natural gas reserves the second-largest in South America after Venezuela whose national resources had been rendered largely off limits to outside investors by the rise of socialist president Hugo Chavez.Carvilles troops were dispatched to La Paz in 02 to consolidate the great victory of ""liberalism"" and ""democracy"" - as they and their sponsors and benefactors understand those things - and to resist the rising tide of Latin American leftism represented in Bolivia by the indigenous political leader Evo Morales Gonis leading opponent. Exactly who decided that a widely disliked candidate in such a small country merited such attention alongside such star GCS clients as Tony Blair the Israeli Labor Party and the Canadian Liberal Party? That remains a question shrouded in mystery but we could probably come up with some decent guesses. Who paid for it? Well that would be you and me - both before and after. Carville and Greenberg won that election for Goni after shifting the entire theme of his campaign to the ""crisis"" mantra but maybe they should have vetted their candidate a little better. Gonis second term as president barely lasted a year after his plans to allow an international consortium to build a pipeline and ship Bolivian natural gas to North America at dirt-cheap prices sparked a massive popular uprising. Facing a general strike and a series of confrontations between soldiers and protesters that left at least 67 civilians dead Goni imposed martial law in October 2003 and the U.S. State Department issued a statement offering its full support. Have they learned nothing? That was almost certainly the final straw. Goni fled the country five days later and now lives in exile in the U.S. which has refused to extradite him to Bolivia to face trial for extrajudicial killings and other crimes against humanity.Since 2006 Bolivia has been governed by Evo Morales the indigenous leader whose protest movement led to Gonis downfall. As one of his first moves as president Morales unilaterally reversed the terms of Bolivias natural gas contracts with foreign corporations Instead of the investors getting 82 percent of the profits and the Bolivian state getting 18 percent it was suddenly the other way around. The corporations whined and complained but ultimately decided that 18 percent was a lot better than nothing. Morales government has dramatically reduced poverty and inequality and presided over one of the worlds fastest-growing economies right through the crash of 2008. Maybe Carville and the Clintonocracy were empowering democracy after all even if it wasnt quite the variety they intended. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Fictional version of award-winning 2005 documentary ... more Photo Patti Perret Warner Bros. Our Brand Is Crisis a rattling mix of elements 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Everything good about ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" is contained in the opening moments in which Sandra Bullock playing a political consultant is interviewed as if for a documentary. She talks about how she used to admire politicians before she started working for them and theres something about her combination of ironic humor and deep-baked disillusionment that suggests a world of ugly experience. To see her is to want to take the movies journey and learn what she knows. ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" has unusual origins. Its a fictional feature but its based on Rachel Boyntons documentary of the same name about the impact of James Carvilles political consulting team on a Bolivian presidential election. This fictional reworking pits two American consulting teams against each other -- one led by Bullock and the other by Carville look-alike Billy Bob Thornton -- but something in the setup feels strained not quite true not quite right. Director David Gordon Green and screenwriter Peter Straughan are going for a tone here a mix of the outlandish and the real a sort of black comic welcome to a land where anything goes. The attempt is to create a reality wide enough to accommodate the extremes of absurdity and hard political truth but the pieces never cohere and so we end up with a rattling bag of disparate elements. Bullock herself holds the movie together for a time and if you want to see evidence of this actress skill dont see her in a better film in which everything is going well. See her in this one in which everything is almost going wrong but it never quite does. From scene to scene she understands what the movie is supposed to be and so she finds a tone from the very first seconds of balancing comedy and drama on a knife edge. She finds glimmers of humor in the dramatic scenes and forlorn resignation in the funny scenes. Its as if shes standing in the middle of two sliding doors that are stuck and shes trying to force them back together with her bare hands. Bullock rewards both attention and inattention. You can enjoy the light surface or see the rueful underpinnings that give her lightness a hint of something mysterious. At the start of the film Jane (Bullock) a political consultant known for being tempestuous gets dragged back into the business after a few years of hermetic seclusion -- and Bullock lets you see that this is a woman who really did need a break. Once in Bolivia she becomes sidelined by altitude sickness but then springs to life when she sees a way to put over her candidate. Her team has the task of trying to elect a politician (Joaquim de Almeida) with no intrinsic warmth so instead of pretending that hes cuddly they present him as the tough daddy needed in a crisis. That means selling the notion that the country actually is in crisis -- hence the title. To the extent that ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" deals with campaign machinations its on solid ground but when it tries to make something zany of the rollicking world of campaign consultants its both unconvincing and tiresome. But the greatest weakness of the film is where it should be strongest in the relationship between the rival consultants played by Bullock and Thornton. Janes competition with him drives the plot and one gets the feeling that every time they meet we should be seeing a clash of titans. But their interaction isnt particularly clever and most of the time its just dispiriting. Instead of looking forward to her scenes with Thornton I started dreading them. The problems are compounded by an ending that is hard to buy not only in terms of story but in the direction it steers the main character. ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" is in that annoying category of movie that sends audiences away thinking ""Its almost good but something is off."" This review has been one critics humble attempt to locate that something and describe it. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Share Tweet Fictionalizing non-fiction is a common practice; most films that purport to be ""based on a true story"" ought to slide a ""loosely"" in front of that boast of veracity. But theres dramatic license and then theres taking real events that are plenty interesting on their lonesome and bending them into the shape of cliche. The political comedy Our Brand Is Crisis shares a setting an area of interest and maybe even an ultimate message with Rachel Boyntons decade-old documentary of the same name about a group of American strategists energizing a doomed presidential campaign in Bolivia circa 2002. This new Crisis sticks to the basic factual outline presented by the old one but it also subs out the major candidates for fictional proxies and invents a brassy composite main character. By changing the names the filmmakers are able to justify converting a ground-level portrait of electioneering--all backroom shoptalk and stump speeches--into a shamelessly commercial Sandra Bullock vehicle. Its a makeover worthy of the vote vampires it ends up critiquing and lionizing.Coaxed out of retirement to pitch in on a lost cause of a campaign one-time master of spin ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine (Bullock) cant seem to get her groove back. Her client wealthy career politician Castillo (Joaquim De Almeida) is running for president of Bolivia a position he won and then relinquished years earlier and hes down almost 30 points from the frontrunner a fiery political upstart promising major change. Not liking the odds Jane treats the first few days on assignment like a paid vacation dozing off during strategy meetings and offering nothing but defeatist naysaying in the face of the teams plan of attack. But just when it seems like shes lost the will to fight Jane discovers that the opposition is being coached by an old professional rival the slickly amoral Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) whos bested her every time theyve gone head to head. Suddenly Jane has a personal stake in the election and out comes a keen mercenary instinct. Shes back baby.Our Brand Is Crisis like its documentary inspiration understands that the key to victory in Bolivia was reframing the election Anyone who watched George W. Bush defeat John Kerry in 2004 will recognize Janes fear-mongering tactics the way she sells Castillos unpopular years in office as the exact experience the country needs during a time of uncertainty and financial hardship. (Amping up the negativity she makes ""Things could get worse"" into a winning slogan.) But Crisis is less interested in the nuts and bolts of siphoning votes than it is in the tenacity of its entirely fictional protagonist who Bullock plays with the take-no-shit spunk that won her an Oscar for The Blind Side. The film fills out Castillos team with a first-rate ensemble of character actors--Anthony Mackie Ann Dowd Scoot McNairy Zoe Kazan--only to reduce them to glorified cheerleaders for our heroine. And it treats the complicated moves and countermoves of a major election as fodder for a broadly comic grudge match with scenes that wouldnt have felt out of place in The Campaign like Jane mooning Pat during a ridiculous bus race or Pat arranging to have a beloved llama run over during the filming of a Castillo spot.All of this labored nuttiness is orchestrated by David Gordon Green wildly uneven director of Southern-fried mood pieces (Joe All The Real Girls) and lowbrow stoner yukfests (Pineapple Express Your Highness) alike. Here Green disappears deeper than he ever has before into workmanlike competence; the only personal signature is a funky slow-mo dance party which the filmmaker somehow manages to insert into every movie he makes. A comeback story that becomes an underdog fable only to belatedly settle on a half-assed redemption arc Our Brand Is Crisis feels closer in spirit to a Jason Reitman joint Like say Thank You For Smoking its the kind of movie that wants you to simultaneously enjoy and condemn the devious tactics of its protagonist rooting for her to triumph while feeling scornful of how she might. Haunted by a dark chapter from her political past Jane is torn between winning at any cost and listening to her nagging conscience embodied by a bright-eyed idealistic young volunteer (Reynaldo Pacheco) straight out of a screenwriting manual. That the film finds a way for Jane to have her cake and eat it too is apropos When it comes to slick and cynical crowd-pleasing Washington has nothing on Hollywood.

(Photo courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures/TNS) Review Our Brand Is Crisis is provocative but a bit underwhelming By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Oct 29 2015 (...) By Jody Mitori St. Louis Post-Dispatch Anthony Mackie Sandra Bullock and Reynaldo Pacheco in ""Our Brand Is Crisis."" (Photo courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures/TNS) Jane Bodine (Sandra Bullock) has had it with being a political strategist. She lives in the middle of nowhere far away from the stressful spin-driven realm in which she used to thrive. Shes clean sober and happy.Or so she thinks -- until she gets a visit from representatives of Pedro Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) a former Bolivian president whos keen to regain his office.Problem is Castillo has abysmal poll numbers and a miserable reputation among the downtrodden. At first Bodine declines. But deep down she longs to get back onto political turf. After all they didnt call her ""Calamity"" Jane for nothing. The campaign brings Bodine face to face with an old foe Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) whos working for a candidate with ""man of the people"" appeal. Candy couldnt be happier that Bodine is back in business -- he loves messing with her head.But Bodine cant afford to be distracted. Castillo is surrounded by staff who are skeptical of her suggestions and he balks when she suggests that his only chance for victory is to go negative.And for this she came out of retirement? Provocative intelligent but just a bit underwhelming ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" -- inspired by a 2005 documentary of the same name -- plays as if the filmmakers started out with Oscar aspirations but ultimately werent up to the challenge.Still director David Gordon Green (""Pineapple Express"") and screenwriter Peter Straughan (""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"") deliver a film with a sure feel for the absurdities of politics. And in Bullock ""Crisis"" has a star who makes the whole thing seem better than it probably is. She brings much the same dynamism to Bodine as she did to astronaut Ryan Stone in the 2013 hit ""Gravity.""Unfortunately Bullock cant make the ending in which her character undergoes an abrupt change of heart come across as anything but a cop-out.What ""Our Brand Is Crisis""  Three stars out of four  Run time 147  Rating R  Content Language including sexual references  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags Our Brand Is Crisis Calvin Wilson Sandra Bullock Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

For a while he was an arthouse darling with movies like ""George Washington"" and ""All the Real Girls."" Then he swung back to farce with a string of stoner comedies including ""Pineapple Express"" and ""The Sitter."" Then it was time for more indie efforts with ""Prince Avalanche"" and ""Manglehorn."" And now? Now he seems somewhere in the middle with ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" a slick political dramedy with bursts of personal humor but an overdose of Hollywood gloss starring Sandra Bullock as a political gun-for-hire who lately no ones hiring. So she finds a new campaign to mastermind - down in Bolivia. It sounds like a fish-out-of-water farce (and sometimes thats how the movie plays) but it springs from a documentary also called ""Our Brand Is Crisis."" The real-life genesis was a 2002 election when James Carville and Co. decided to export their slogan-slinging image-creating political talents abroad. As if they hadnt already done enough harm here. The problem is there are two movies onscreen. One is a Sandy Bullock picture in which shes adorable but slightly disorganized - that stereotypical hard-charging Hollywood career woman whos smarter than the boys but single sarcastic and addicted to junk food (even though of course she never gains an ounce). The other movie is a David Gordon Green film which has a number of smart visual flourishes that marry form and content - like brightly colored bar graphs that pop up to show the status of the campaign or staging that puts Bullock and frenemy Billy Bob Thornton in the same hotel across a wide atrium from each other. Theyre in each others line of vision but separate close by but very far a metaphor for the sort of intimate/distant relationships that Bullock has with everyone. Except that two movies on screen are just as divided. Bullock is as easy to relate to as ever and Thornton is marvelously malignant as the Carville clone. And the movie bounces along sprightly for a long time with lots of nice touches like Zoe Kazan as a deadpan excavator of political dirt or Bullocks habit of throwing out aphorisms (many of which she attributes to Warren Beatty). Except - should we really be identifying at these people? Laughing a little uncomfortably at their own cynicism and opportunism - even appreciating their own wicked joy - is one thing. Yet ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" thanks largely to its star casting seems to ask us to approve of them. Remember that in real life the Bolivian race involved a trio of right-wing moderate and left-wing candidates. The American operatives helped elect the right-winger - who then drove the country into such violent unrest that he fled the country. So what really did these Americans accomplish? Besides make a lot of consulting fees for themselves and exporting one of our least attractive products - the big-budget political campaign? The film produced by George Clooney suggests at least some of the characters reformed later - but thats like having your snark and hating it too. (Imagine ""The Candidate"" only with Peter Boyle getting the right-winger elected -- then feeling bad about it and joining the Peace Corps.) Its a redemption tale for the kind of people who in real life dont recognize any sin but losing. ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" is enjoyable but a far braver movie would present these people as they are Defiantly guiltless ""professionals"" who only want to package a product - any product - so that millions of morons will line up and buy it. I mean its not as if thats a foreign concept in Hollywood. Ratings note The film contains strong language substance abuse and brief nudity. Our Brand Is Crisis (R) Warner Bros. (108 min.)

"Our Brand is Crisis cant decide if its comedy or drama review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesOur Brand is Crisis cant decide if its comedy or drama review Like the ruthless political strategists the film both satirizes and celebrates Our Brand Is Crisis wants to have it both ways.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 29 2015Our Brand Is CrisisStarring Sandra Bullock Billy Bob Thornton Anthony Mackie Ann Dowd Scott McNairy and Joaquim de Almeida. Directed by David Gordon Green. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. 107 minutes. 14ALike the ruthless political strategists the film both satirizes and celebrates Our Brand Is Crisis speaks out of both sides of its mouth.David Gordon Greens bumpy enterprise co-produced by its star Sandra Bullock (with her Gravity pal George Clooney) wants us to laugh at the lengths to which spin doctors and other campaigning weasels will go to get their candidates elected.Article Continued BelowIt also wants us to feel some sympathy for these ballot-box Beelzebubs and to perhaps hope for their redemption whatever that might involve.Sandra Bullock centre in Our Brand Is Crisis.  (Courtesy Warner Bros.)  This approach rarely works in the real world and it doesnt here especially with Green setting his story -- scripted by Peter Straughan (TVs Wolf Hall) and loosely adapted from a same-name 2005 doc -- in Bolivia of all places. As the story goes despised former Bolivian president Pedro Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) is seeking to regain office in the face of withering opinion polls and a likeable opponent who sees victory at hand.Enter Sandra Bullocks ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine a one-time political rainmaker whose life is now as disconnected as the remote mountain cabin where shes been holed up drying out and regretting some bad choices.Faster than you can say ""Ay caramba"" shes in La Paz with the patented Bullock shtick in full effect as she shocks her conservative campaign co-workers -- thanklessly played by Anthony Mackie Ann Dowd Zoe Kazan and Scott McNairy -- with her cynical antics.She at first doesnt really care if Castillo wins and neither do we. Her initial few days are spent dragging an oxygen tank around as she adjusts to the high altitude. Jane finally rises to the challenge when her snakelike old rival Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) shows up to shill for the other side restoring Janes will to fight -- and also to fight dirty.Had Green really gone in for the laughs as he did with his drug caper Pineapple Express the absurdity of two unscrupulous Americans fighting tooth and nail to elect a shady Bolivian might have hit the bulls eye.But he doesnt instead approaching the bulls hindquarters with an unearned redemption saga thats as phony as a stuffed ballot box. Thats politics for you but it doesnt make for a great movie.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Some movies just come out of the chute branded with failure. Our Brand is Crisis which premiered to unenthusiastic groans at the recent Toronto International Film Festival is a wildly uneven and commercially doomed vehicle for Sandra Bullock produced by her pal George Clooney written by the pretentious Peter Straughan who wrote a forgotten monstrosity called The Men Who Stare at Goats for Mr. Clooney six years ago and directed by David Gordon Green the wobbly second-rate director responsible for such feeble-minded duds as Pineapple Express and more recently the Al Pacino disaster Manglehorn. OUR BRAND IS CRISIS  (2/4 stars) Written by Peter Straughan Directed by David Gordon Green Starring Sandra Bullock Billy Bob Thornton and Anthony Mackie Running time 107 min. Wasting their collective energy on Our Brand is Crisis theyve come up with a sloppy mess about the spin doctors who get paid big bucks to manipulate political elections that exemplifies much of whats wrong with movies today--vanity projects made with arrogant disregard for the audience by friends with a lot of money and not many serious cultural credentials who call in favors from each other to make movies nobody wants to see--all serious flaws for which Mr. Clooney is famous. In a role that was originally written for Mr. Clooney Ms. Bullock is ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine a cartoonish political strategist based on President Bill Clintons right-hand powerball James Carville who was called in to mastermind the 2002 election of a Bolivian president in whom nobody had much faith or trust including Mr. Carville. In the movie which fictionalizes material from a far superior 2005 documentary of the same name by Rachel Boynton the Carville character has been changed into a female screwball who comes out of retirement to fix one more election--this time for unpopular do-nothing former Bolivian president Pedro Castillo. Janes credo is ""I can make myself believe in anything--if the money is good."" But the main reason shes gung-ho for this job is because her candidates opponent is represented by her rival political campaign coach and archenemy Pat Candy (a bald Billy Bob Thornton). Intended as a cynical take on the kind of 20th century electioneering in which corruption often overwhelms the odds the movie wafts and drones and shifts gears so many times that it is never as funny pointed jaundiced or clever as it could have been and much less politically significant than it should be. Instead of concentrating on the speed bumps that confront Jane on her arrival in South America--a middle-aged candidate with a poor track record no enthusiasm for the job and zero charisma--the movie wastes an inordinate amount of time showing Jane as a potential loser herself. The focus is not on the candidates but on the hotshot strategists who will stop at nothing to defeat each other. While the two politicos both of whom are just inches above the status of crooks run their campaigns their two advisors do everything they can to sabotage them. Theyre all ruthless. To make things worse Jane is a dizzy jet-lagged frizzy-haired mess with red swollen eyes as well as a history of breakdowns job failures depression and a weak colon. The humor doesnt always collate satisfactorily with the serious political conflicts (the constant vomiting scenes are just plain silly) and the happy ending although based on reality is unconvincing and naive. The star even moons the public from a bus window in one prank that falls disappointingly flat no pun intended. Its more interesting to watch Jane struggle to turn her cold conservative candidate into a warm and likeable winner even when he punches a constituent in the face. She temporarily regains her old creative spunk turning the embarrassing incident into front-page heroism selling Bolivia as a country in crisis and Castillo as the only man who can roll up his sleeves and save it. But Pat Candy has a few trumps up his sleeve too. Duking it out through false advertising insincere slogans and false images that guarantee phony promises its Godzilla vs. Mothra until you wish they were both dead. The dialogue is atrocious. The locations in Puerto Rico and La Paz provide tropical ambience. Zoe Kazan Anthony Mackie Scoot McNairy and Joaquim de Almeida are wasted members of the under-used supporting cast and Our Brand Is Crisis adds up to a toothless exercise in missed opportunities that is half cautionary tale half political satire and oddly insignificant as both.

Based on a 2005 documentary about a group of D.C. strategists who went to Bolivia to help get a long-shot candidate elected president this blunt-edged satire blindly grasps for a tone that works and comes up short. Is it a Miss Congeniality Goes to La Paz bit of slapstick? The sight of Bullock pratfalling as she steps off a plane and mooning from a bus window points to yes. But wait now shes all business in black glasses indicting political corruption with her staff (Zoe Kazan Anthony Mackie Ann Dowd and Scoot McNairy all overqualified). Its not that light comedy cant be mixed with something heavier--Primary Colors juggled the two expertly. Its just that the comedy here isnt very funny and the drama isnt very sharp.

"Review Our Brand Is Crisis offers nothing new - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Our Brand Is Crisis offers nothing newBy Tony Hicksthicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 10/27/2015 041701 PM PDTUpdated 10/28/2015 051114 PM PDT So heres what were supposed to know after seeing ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" Politics is an ugly business. Sandra Bullock is still great at playing characters who are smart honest charmingly disheveled and cynical only as much as is thematically necessary. Billy Bob Thornton is still great at playing fast-talking smarmy too-smart-for-their-own-good characters with control issues who seem terribly comfortable leering at women. Nearly 200 years after the Monroe Doctrine the U.S. still seems to think Latin America looks to us for leadership.Yep. That about does it. (L-R) Billy Bob Thornton as Pat Candy and Sandra Bullock as Jane in Our Brand is Crisis. (Patti Perret/Warner Bros.) ( Patti Perret/Warner Bros. ) OK there is a bit more than this to David Gordon Greens cynical and semicomedic look at two rival American political operatives slugging it out in South America. ""Crisis"" which is adapted from Rachel Boyntons documentary of the same name about the 2002 Bolivian presidential election is a decent movie -- even if its not sure if its a comedy (Bullock falls down stairs lugs around an oxygen machine throws up etc.) a jagged lesson in politics or a grand statement about fighting the power.It occasionally succeeds at all of these things but it doesnt pack enough punch in any one area to make ""Crisis"" more than watchable. And thats even given the George Clooney-produced films keen sense of timing. Filmmakers obviously are hoping to take advantage of a robust election season to spark interest in a fairly believable look at campaigns being more about winning than actual change.Advertisement Bullock plays ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine a burned-out campaign veteran coaxed back into the game by the chance to take on former rival Pat Candy played by Thornton. Candy is managing Victor Rivera the current favorite in the Bolivian presidential race. Bodines job is to revive the campaign of former President Pedro Gallo (Joaquim de Almeida) an unpopular former president whos running 28 points behind.What follows is predictable -- Bodines competitive juices get rekindled and she injects fire into the Gallo campaign by retooling its message to stress that Bolivia needs an experienced man over a likable one to steer the country out of a supposed ""crisis.""Bullock and Thornton were safe choices for their roles. Thornton already tackled a James Carville-like operative in 1998s ""Primary Colors"" while Bullock played nearly the same character she plays here in 2002s ""Two Weeks Notice."" They have a rollicking chemistry keeping things fun for a while as they exchange smears and backdoor tricks.Perhaps partly as a means to not totally marginalize the Bolivian people Green and screenwriter Peter Straughan throw fresh-faced Gallo campaign worker Eddie (Reynaldo Pacheco) into the mix. Eddies late father idolized the former President Gallo which suggests hes at least capable of being the leader everyone else says hes not. Eddies politically savvy brothers get involved in a night on the town with campaign workers that ends with the gang vandalizing Candys hotel room. But before that they engage in political dialogue that we can be thankful demonstrates Bolivians arent as helpless and uninformed as the film might otherwise suggest.But the overriding message which certainly isnt new is that power corrupts and politics is a nasty game not meant for the little people. But in ""Crisis"" the point is not powerfully made. Nothing here will outrage an audience unless people object to the tired notion that other countries still desperately need the U.S. to manage their affairs.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.Our Brand is Crisis   1/2Rating R (language including some sexual references)Cast Sandra Bullock Billy Bob ThorntonDirector David Gordon GreenRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesOpens Oct. 30 in wide releasePrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

TWITTER Sandra Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton star as rival political consultants embroiled in a Bolivian election in David Gordon Greens new film. An oddball political outing that feels halfway between a studio film and an indie as well as something between a farce and a political expose Our Brand Is Crisis is actually a fictionalized take on a trenchant 2005 documentary of the same name about American consultants not-so-pretty involvement in a Bolivian presidential election. Quite possibly a sort-of bonus bestowed by Warner Bros. on star Sandra Bullock and co-producer George Clooney for having done Gravity director David Gordon Greens latest unpredictable addition to his resume is offbeat and appealing on some levels but is neither as funny nor as trenchant as it might have been. Its fair to say this wont be one of Bullocks biggest grossers. The model for Bullocks memorably named character ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine is actually none other than Bill Clintons well-known election operative James Carville who in the early 2000s was hired to advise on what turned out to be a successful campaign to regain office by an unpopular former Bolivian president. Dragged from the seclusion of a mountain cabin where shes been lying low and drying out after a series of unsuccessful consulting gigs the seemingly terminally depressive Jane accompanies a small team (played by Anthony Mackie Ann Dowd Scott McNairy and Zoe Kazan) to Bolivia to see what they can do for former head of state Pedro Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) a handsome middle-aged upper-cruster of no evident political convictions or ability at articulation. Given his lack of enthusiasm Castillo may be running again just for lack of anything better to do. Read more I Saw the Light TIFF Review For her part upon arriving in La Paz Jane suffers from a prolonged bout of altitude-induced nausea compounded by a foggy cluelessness over how to sell the public on Castillo whose polling numbers are pathetic. An anti-big business man-of-the-people populist has a commanding lead that would seem impervious to anything a corrupt out-of-touch ruling class figure could do or say. For perhaps longer than is advisable in terms of viewer interest Jane herself comes off as a lost cause an undoubtedly once-sharp cookie who now shows no signs of regaining her edge or strategic creativity; with her stringy dyed blonde hair and often puffy reddish eyes she looks out of it even ill. But a weird incident in which a local smashes an egg on Castillos head whereupon the candidate slugs the man back jolts the campaign to a semblance of life as does the presence of a rival American political strategist Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) with whom Jane has a past that is at least professionally competitive (his candidates have beaten hers repeatedly of late) but perhaps was once something more. Amusingly Thornton here sports a shaved cue-ball head that immediately reminds of Carville. Thus awakened Jane lurches back to life taking up smoking again creating disturbances and pulling outrageous stunts like having the train from which the leading candidate is speaking pull out of the station prematurely and drag racing the oppositions bus with her own on a windy rural road. Jane clearly only comes fully alive when the gloves come off and no blow is too low for her to throw. Her ultimate piece of political wisdom ""Getting hurt is unavoidable if you want to play this game."" The script by Peter Straughan (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Wolf Hall in addition to The Men Who Stare At Goats for Clooney and Heslov six years ago) is fair as far as it goes but the film feels half-baked as if it were torn between being an all-out indictment of American meddling in South American political affairs and a scorchingly outrageous satire on politics in a neighborhood where no help is needed from ""yanquis"" where corruption is concerned. Read more The Martian TIFF Review Under the direction of the ever-eclectic Green there are amusements to be had especially when Bullock finally begins cranking up her character to distinctly disreputable levels. But theres the lingering feeling of opportunities missed of things not being said that might have been of stones being unturned that might have revealed much more about the shortcomings of political systems not exactly known for their reliability and righteousness. A double-dose of Preston Sturges-like high-and-low comedy injected into the proceedings would have been just what the doctor ordered. At the same time there is a color and vitality stemming from a film shot in unusual places for a Hollywood production (foreign location work was done in Laz Paz and Puerto Rico) as well as from Bullock playing a highly disreputable character and not caring how she looks or comes off; she even moons some victims of her pranks from a bus window.

In this fictionalized adaptation of Rachel Boyntons 2005 documentary of the same title Jane who had been burned by some bad electoral defeats overcomes her initial misgivings and flings herself into the race with febrile energy. Shes endearingly overwhelmed by the thin atmosphere in the high altitude of La Paz and stymied by the language barrier but her competitive spirit is sparked by the arrival of her onetime lover and longtime nemesis Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) in an opposing candidates corner. The director David Gordon Green has little feel for the movies comic turns and his way with the drama is held back by his obvious and conventional sympathies. The political background on which the story runs is sketched thinly; curiosity about Bolivian life is shunted off to a few lines of dialogue and an abundance of folkloric costumes.

Photo Patti Perret Can Oscar winner Sandra Bullock in top form overcome longtime American audience resistance to comedies about politics and maybe even get another nomination in the process? It will be interesting to see if Warner Bros. can achieve these goals with David Gordon Greens ""Our Brand is Crisis"" which fictionalizes a documentary about a pair of battling American political consultants who shaped the 2002 Bolivian presidential contest. Both consultants were men in real life but one of the roles in this long-in-development project produced by George Clooney was rewritten to Bullocks strengths as a comedian and dramatic actress. She goes to town as ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine a ruthless consultant who is recruited out of retirement by a couple of other consultants (Anthony Mackie and Ann Dowd) four years after a tragic incident caused some sort of breakdown. They convince Jane who is renowned for jump-starting the campaigns of losers to lend her expertise to an arrogant and charmless former Bolivian president who even looks like a bad guy (Joaquim de Almeida often cast in American films as a drug lord) and is languishing in fifth place in the presidential polls. Once she gets over her revulsion to her candidate altitude sickness and lets Bullock show off some slapstick skills we havent seen in a while Janes answer to the problem is an American-style campaign that offers the candidate up as the only solution to an imaginary ""crisis"" in Bolivia and includes lots of dirty tricks aimed at the charismatic frontrunner including smearing him as a Nazi sympathizer. Jane is energized by her longtime rivalry with the other candidates American consultant whose ruthless tactics in an earlier election she suspects may have led to her breakdown. Hes played with malevolent charm by Billy Bob Thornton as another version of the real-life ""Ragin Cajun"" James Carville just as Thornton did in the Clinton-a-clef film ""Primary Colors"" (1998). Thornton has such great chemistry with Bullock (in his best film work in years) that I wish Thornton had more screen time but he makes the most of what he gets. The excellent cast includes such pros as Scoot McNairy and Zoe Kazan. This cynical look at the state of the art in political campaigning (in the U.S. as well as Bolivia) does not go particularly deep and the ending isnt great but director Green (""Pineapple Express"") does stage a handful of highly entertaining sequences including a bus chase on a mountain road and Janes epic bender.

So Hollywood you say you want strong roles for women? How about an American campaign strategist who doesnt hesitate to stand up to or stare down the candidate poised to become Bolivias next president? Shes not the next Erin Brockovich (its one thing to litigate carcinogens out of the local water supply and quite another to pump toxins into the system) but as played by Sandra Bullock ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" political spin doctor Jane Bodine is easily one of the best female roles of the last 10 years -- which makes it all the more satisfying to learn that it was originally written for ""Gravity"" co-star George Clooney. The movie itself is something more of a mess though designedly so fictionalizing the incursion of U.S. marketing tactics in the 2002 Bolivian election first captured in Rachel Boyntons documentary of the same name. Ironically enough the thing this David Gordon Green-directed smarthouse satire could use most is a good old campaign of its own (the awards-season kind naturally) to raise its profile especially given audiences typically allergic reaction to anything remotely political in theaters. Bullock certainly deserves the support drawing upon her serious and comedic sides to create a character who might as well have been plucked directly from the world of studio filmmaking Coffee-jittery and nicotine-deprived Bodine embodies all the hallmarks of a distaff power agent or studio chief. With her aggressively styled hair Hollywood shades and entitled attitude shes either intimidatingly fabulous or fabulously intimidating but either way others seem to shrink in her presence. If Bolivia were a dictatorship she could be its Eva Peron. To quote Winston Churchill ""It has been said that Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."" Over the roughly 200 years that popular elections have been in place in the United States those seeking power have learned how to game the system hiring strategists to help them legally manipulate the vote (though comedian/commentator Russell Brand claims they neednt even bother insisting that ""Every election in American history has been won by the party with the most money to campaign with""). Bodine thinks and speaks in such political parables quoting everyone from Sun Tzu to Warren Beatty as she attempts to make her points. Having either just suffered or narrowly avoided a nervous breakdown Bodine is holed up in her cabin in the woods somewhere making clay pottery when a pair of campaign consultants (Anthony Mackie and Ann Dowd) knock on her door with a wild proposal Given her Midas touch turning dead-meat political candidates into winners would she consider flying down to Bolivia to help get ex-president Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida so often cast as the non-white drug czar or villain) elected to office? Castillo is currently dangling in fifth place with just 8% support in the polls but theyre convinced that Bodine can turn that around. What they fail to mention is that the leading candidate a well-coiffed man-of-the-people type named Rivera (Louis Arcella) has also hired his own strategist Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) a sneaky chauvinistic manipulator who has won every campaign in which he and Bodine have competed. Thornton may as well be reprising his Southern-drawling ""Primary Colors"" role considering that both characters were based on Bill Clinton campaign manager James Carville (the direct subject of Boyntons documentary whereas Bodine is a total invention). Candy may be a snake oil salesman of the highest order but its Bodine whos willing to sell her soul here taking the job without bothering to learn Spanish or a thing about the candidate shes representing. Her qualifications are simple ""Its personal and Im pissed"" she tells Castillo. In Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrows new Brian De Palma documentary the director tells a story about how Columbia exec Dawn Steel flew to the set in Thailand took one look and caught the next plane home. Thats the sort of character Bullock seems to be channeling here She wields the power but is also susceptible to the elements hit with altitude sickness and forced to drag around an oxygen tank from the moment she lands in Bolivia. Its a performance that depends just as much on body language as it does old-fashioned pratfalls (slippery staircases and collapsing folding chairs) though the pleasure comes in watching how Bodines mind works At times she clearly doesnt have a clue how to improve the situation but when the ideas start to flood shes a force to be reckoned with -- every bit a match for ""Wag the Dogs"" string-pullers or ""In the Loops"" Peter Capaldi. While TV viewers are spoiled these days by ""Veep"" showrunner Armando Iannuccis rapid-fire brand of political satire ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" screenwriter Peter Straughan (""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"") is just about the next best thing moviegoers can find. This particular screenplay proves a bit light on actual dialogue relying instead on a litany of chestnuts cribbed from ""Bartletts Familiar Quotations"" as Bodine and Candy both recycle their all-time favorite politically themed zingers. Even so Straughans a whiz when it comes to inventing outrageous confrontations including a post-debate rotten-egging that inspires Bodines crisis-peddling strategy and a cliffside game of chicken between rival campaign buses. By sticking to the half-true details of an actual election (in reality Carvilles candidate won) Green and company put an artificial ceiling on the pics satirical potential. Had they fictionalized the country ""Crisis"" could have joined the ranks of ""Duck Soup"" or ""The Mouse That Roared."" Instead we find ourselves wondering why we should care about a rigged banana-republic election when they could have taken on the electoral system back home -- except that things work virtually the same way in the States making Bolivia a synecdoche for a more systemic problem with democracy. Apart from a few amusing detours the critique builds exactly as one might expect with Green (who delivers his most professional work since ""Pineapple Express"") overreaching somewhat in the final stretch as he attempts to tie things up with a ""Medium Cool""-style moral commentary in which the ultra-cynical Bodine suddenly decides to grow a conscience. ""In politics perception matters"" the end credits advise and for Bullocks offscreen campaign to register one supposes she had to find her soul.

This kind of critics just shame the cinephilia and awards season. Our Brand Is Crisis is a horrible movie with bad and forgettable performance. Reply Christina says September 11 2015 at 918 pm God the film is bad as Sandy performance is as well. The critic should mention that. Reply Hailee says September 11 2015 at 908 pm Watching Charlotte Rampling in 45 Years I dont see how this boring Bullocks performance can be nominated to Oscar over magnificent Rampling. Reply Gene says September 12 2015 at 1241 pm Sadly Sandy Bullock will be nominated over Rampling because she constantly receives too much hype- very similar to Jennifer Lawrence. . Both actresses that always play themselves in all their roles. Reply Maddison says September 11 2015 at 856 pm Its rare cuz I didnt like at all the movie and neither Bullocks performance. Reply Silvana says September 11 2015 at 849 pm I think Peter Debruge doesnt understand the hypocrite this film is. It hasnt any mention to US to dictatorships in South America this is too light politica film lie bullshits and overacted.
