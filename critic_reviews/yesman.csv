Yes Man. (PG-13) Warner Bros. (105 min.) Directed by Peyton Reed. With Jim Carrey Zooey Deschanel. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS Carl Allen lives in the negative. His friends think he should start dating again? No. His next-door-neighbor wants him to stop by for a cake a muffin a cup of tea? No. A long line of supplicants at his loan-officers desk want to start a business go on vacation splurge on a gift? No no no. And then Carl decides to say yes. Its all thanks to a slightly flaky old friend and the ""transformational"" seminar he drags him to -- you know one of those all-day Ramada Inn affairs where caffeinated pitchmen push their books. Only this pitch is simple. Say yes to every opportunity. Say yes to everyone. Just say yes. Thats the idea behind ""Yes Man."" And its a small nice return to form by Jim Carrey whose most recent onscreen appearances include the paranoid ""The Number 23"" and unfunny ""Fun With Dick and Jane."" Its not a great movie but its a lot better than what hes been turning out. Perhaps its because (as in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" ""The Truman Show"" and ""Man in the Moon"") Carreys finally working with a good director again. Its a sad pattern with comics but generally they look for malleable hacks; theyre convinced they know whats funny and the last thing they want is an auteur with ideas. Which goes a long way toward explaining the last decade or so of Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy movies. Peyton Reed who directs here is no Milos Forman or Peter Weir but hes better than the filmmakers Carrey usually pushes around. Reeds ""Down With Love"" a careful homage to Rock-and-Doris comedies showed a careful eye if not an abundance of wit; his follow-up ""The Break-Up"" was amazingly both funny and adult. ""Yes Man"" isnt that adult -- theres a senior-sex scene weve already seen in ""Soul Men"" and plenty of pratfalls -- but its well-edited and has some nicely offbeat moments. Some of those come from Reeds sense of pace and payoff; many of them come from the supporting cast. Kiwi actor Rhys Darby from ""Flight of the Conchords"" is winning as Carls socially maladroit boss; as a new love in Carls life Zooey Deschanel has the inside track on taking the Adorable Kook crown from Maggie Gyllenhaal. If theres a weak link in this Jim Carrey movie it is ironically Jim Carrey. He has always worked too hard for laughs class-clowning his way through even throwaway bits of exposition; its as if hes terrified that for one brief moment you might doubt that hes the funniest person in the room. The problem is that here that works against his character. The point of ""Yes Man"" is that Carl is transformed; he needs to start off as a sad-sack loser like Jack Lemmon in ""The Apartment"" so he can be reborn. But thats anathema to Carrey; he needs too desperately for us to like him. And so he yuks it up from the start and dilutes the change to come. Still the incidental pleasures of ""Yes Man"" connect. Like Luis Guzman as a would-be suicide Carrey tries to counsel. Or Deschanels cult band Munchausen by Proxy (which performs for some reason wearing lobster masks). Or Darbys elaborate pathetic costume parties or Terence Stamps rap as the self-help guru. Is ""Yes Man"" hysterical? No. Is it terribly romantic? No. Is it going to give you every dimes worth of your 11 ticket price? Well I dont know maybe. But does it mark the beginning of a comeback for a comic who will not only do anything for a laugh but frequently does too much? Yes. Rating note The film contains strong language comic nudity alcohol abuse and sexual situations. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

As it turns out that was only the trailer. The movie offered an additional 102 minutes of a depressed loan officer saying yes every time hes asked to do something. Does Jim Carrey annoy his friends by saying no every time they ask him to come out to play? Would actual friends forget about such a drippy loser within a week after he started blowing them off? Does he turn his life around after a friend drags him to a positive-think seminar run by a freaky guru (Terence Stamp)? Wouldnt you go along with the program if told to say yes to everything by General Zod? When the guru says we should ""gobble up lifes energies and excrete the waste"" was I regretting my career path? Does Carrey encounter a few blandly disagreeable situations like agreeing to drive a homeless guy to a scary park and letting him run down the battery on his cellphone? Wouldnt a guy in this situation instantly be bankrupted by Nigerian Internet scammers? Wouldnt he run out of hours for all the language and music courses and charity work hes offered? Was I wishing hed agree to follow some Crips down a dark alley and never return? Does this movie say a sure way to get promoted at a bank is to approve all loans no matter how unlikely to be repaid? Is it possible that the chuckleheads at Citibank and WaMu got a sneak peek of this movie a couple of years ago? Does the blue-eyed alterna-cutie Zooey Deschanel demean herself by playing a scooter-driving girl who randomly strikes up a conversation with Carrey at a gas station? Do the two of them make out only to part again forever? Does forever turn out to be about two days at which point he runs into her again by agreeing to go see a ridiculous rock act she fronts? Do you find it hard to believe she wouldnt notice that he says yes to everything as their relationship deepens? Do you think she would think hes kind of deranged? Does the movie kill lots of time by throwing in situations where saying yes doesnt even apply like a scene in which Carrey saves a guy from jumping off a ledge by playing him a song on a guitar? Does he bungee-jump off a bridge because the movie needs one more wacky shot for the trailer? Does the power of repetition gradually make him a better person? Would you be better off watching ""Groundhog Day"" for the 10th time instead? Is there a gross-out scene in which an old lady offers him oral sex? Will there be a close-up of the glass of water she puts her dentures in? Are there enough idiots to make this movie a hit? Is Carreys elastic-man act a lot less funny than it used to be? Is he 10 years too old for gags like vrooming around on a Ducati while wearing a hospital gown? Was everyone around him in grade school when ""Ace Ventura"" came out? Except General Zod who was probably still banished to the Phantom Zone? Did I laugh less than once? Can you do better than an entire movie as predictable and annoying as this review? kyle.smithnypost.com YES MAN ""The Secret"" plus pratfalls. Running time 104 minutes. Rated PG-13 (crude sexual humor profanity brief nudity). At the Lincoln Square the 34th Street the Kips Bay others.

(Courtesy of Warner Bros.) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday December 18 2008 719 PM Its so easy to imagine the pitch meeting that led to the making of Peyton Reeds ""Yes Man"" Screenwriter So Jim Carrey plays this guy who cant lie about anything no matter what Studio Exec Um hasnt that already been done? Screenwriter Oh. Right. (Pause.) Okay then Jim Carrey plays this guy who cant say no to anything no matter what Studio Exec PERFECT. We LOVE it More than anything ""Yes Man"" is about someone stuck in a confusing midlife crisis aware he has the potential to go further but still reliant on his old way of doing things. And yeah Im talking about the leading man. But also as it happens the character he plays. Carreys Carl is a bored loan officer whos been in a rut since his ex (Molly Sims) left -- three years ago. So when a friend (John Michael Higgins) drags him to a self-help seminar he finds himself intrigued. According to the guru onstage (Terence Stamp) the secret of happiness is built around a single word. Care to guess what it is? Thats right Carl walks out of the lecture determined to say ""yes"" to everything that comes his way. When a homeless guy asks for a ride he agrees. When sad sacks at the bank ask for loans he provides them. And when artsy Allison (Zooey Deschanel) turns his head he doesnt look away. Although three people worked on the script -- which is based on a memoir by Danny Wallace -- the story is so superficial we never get any sense of who Carl really is. This unfortunately requires Carrey to work overtime indulging in near-ly two hours of shameless mugging. The rubbery faces that worked years ago now feel tired; without his antics theres nothing to see. An appealing Deschanel does her best but the pair is mismatched in every way from age to attitude. The entire movie is hung on Carreys shtick so if youre a fan youll have a decent time. Then again if you own the superior ""Liar Liar"" you might as well stay home and watch it again. When Hollywood cant be both-ered to come up with new ideas we have every right to just say no.

"Yes Man (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Yes Man (PG-13)  No kidding -- there really is a good story with the gags. Carl(Jim Carrey) and Allison (Zooey Deschanel) attend a ""Harry Potter""-themed party in Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshows comedy ""Yes Man "" distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Share Print Save to your profile Rene Rodriguez Miami Herald Theres a lot more going on in Yes Man than just another Jim Carrey high-concept comedy a la Liar Liar. Yes the films central conceit allows Carrey plenty of opportunity for his manic rubber-faced antics -- including one memorably hilarious riff on the effects of drinking too much Red Bull. He plays Carl a depressed bank loan officer who rarely leaves his apartment and decides to turn his life around after attending a self-help seminar by saying yes to every request invitation or suggestion that comes his way. Want to come to a Harry Potter party dressed as your favorite character? Just name the time Accept a junk e-mail from persianwifefinder.com? Sure. Help out a homeless guy who wants a ride across town? No problem. Agree to a midday romp in bed with the seriously senior woman who lives next door? Um . . . OK. But make it quick. Director Peyton Reed (Bring It On The Break-Up) working from a script co-written by Nicholas Stoller (who directed Forgetting Sarah Marshall) never runs out of situations to test Carls newfound resolve to embrace life. The story also cleverly pays off many of the random things Carl decides to do Who knew that flying lessons learning to play the guitar or speaking Korean could turn out to be so useful? This is all well and good but it is also familiar territory for Carrey who has mugged and hammed his way through this kind of lowbrow turf before. What distinguishes Yes Man is the effectiveness of the films supporting characters from New Zealand comedian Rhys Darby as his hopelessly and endearingly nerdy boss to Terence Stamp as the imperious motivational speaker who sends Carl on his yes quest. Best of all is Zooey Deschanel as a free-spirited young woman drawn to Carls impulsiveness and spontaneity unaware his willingness to go with the flow isnt part of his natural personality. Their romance a requisite subplot of practically every studio comedy made in Hollywood would normally feel like filler. But Carrey and Deschanel have an exquisitely oddball chemistry that makes you look forward to their scenes together. In certain shots the actors seem to be cracking each other up unintentionally but the pleasure they are taking in those scenes blends right into the narrative. Yes Man is fine as far as Carrey comedies go -- the Third Eye Blind bit is a classic piece of throwaway business -- but its even better as a love story that just happens to make you laugh.

Nor does it spring quite as high as Carreys own Bruce Almighty or Liar Liar. But it bounces. And given the gloom of this seasons holiday releases it is positively cheering just to see a character turn his frown upside down. Carrey plays Carl Allen a drone of a loan officer at a Los Angeles bank so down that depression looks like up to him. He has been immune to fun since his wife Stephanie (Molly Sims) decamped two years ago. Carl routinely denies all loan applications drinks with his buddies and invitations to his boss parties (which conveniently for the films studio are theme events based on Warner Brothers releases Harry Potter and 300). Carls only companion is the DVD he falls asleep to. Then he bumps into an old friend Nick (John Michael Higgins reliable laugh inducer) as lively as Carl is a killjoy. Whats Nicks secret? A motivational speaker named Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp) who preaches the power of positive thinking. Thus Carl who closed himself off from new experiences by saying no to everything opens himself up by saying yes. To everyone including the bum who asks for his wallet. What ensues is formulaic but diverting as Carl finds himself in situations where he meets a hottie performance artist Allison (Zooey Deschanel) learns to pilot an airplane studies Korean and generally finds joy where he formerly encountered fear. Carrey an actor who is deft at the extremes of behavior but seems to have no middle range (hes like a car that works only in first and fifth gears) effortlessly mood-swings from subdued to exuberant. Like many previous Carrey vehicles the point of this one directed by Peyton Reed is that one should not live at the extremes but should achieve a balance between low and high no and yes. Yes Mans conclusion is foregone. But like the motivational speaker says life is about the journey rather than the destination. This is a movie that makes a weekend getaway to Lincoln Nebraska feel like a joyride. Yes Man 1/2 Directed by Peyton Reed written by Nicholas Stoller Jarrad Paul and Andrew Mogel based on the book by Danny Wallace photography by Robert D. Yeoman distributed by Warner Brothers. With Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel. Running time 1 hour 44 mins.

(AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Melissa Moseley)  NO ... more Photo Melissa Moseley AP Movie review Just say no to Carreys Yes Man 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Yes Man Romantic comedy. Starring Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel. Directed by Peyton Reed. (PG-13. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Jim Carrey has reached an uncomfortable point in his career He has gotten too old to act that way. You know that way. That weird Jim Carrey way. Like Jerry Lewis who got too old to squeal ""Dean"" like a 6-year-old Carrey has reached the point where his familiar eye-popping crazy-smiling shtick no longer seems anarchic just creepy; no longer cute just creepy; and no longer funny just creepy. Like Lewis Carrey is bound to make an adjustment soon. Hes too talented to go away. But one thing is clear What hes doing in ""Yes Man"" is no strategy for the long haul. ""Yes Man"" is the kind of career move a performer makes in lieu of actually making a career move. Its an attempt to hover in place. In ""Liar Liar"" he played a man who could not stop telling the truth. ""Yes Man"" stays close to formula Hes a guy who goes to a life-improvement seminar and resolves to say yes to life - to say yes to any request thats made of him. So if a homeless man asks him for a ride he has to say yes. If the same homeless man asks him for all his money he has to say yes. If an Internet advertisement asks him if he wants to join a Persian dating service etc. etc. everythings yes yes yes. The fun is supposed to be in watching Carrey squirm with discomfort but that turns out not to be much fun. Surprisingly the movie provides no escalating series of comic disasters resulting from each yes. The comedy to the extent there is any consists mainly of Carreys verbal asides and strained reactions to people. The script gives him very little to work with. It does give him an attractive and engaging leading lady in Zooey Deschanel who is quirky in her own right but once again the script doesnt come through. Its just a generic girl role with a few eccentric characteristics tacked on but not in any way that affects the characters speech or behavior. Really all Deschanel gets to do is look at Carrey and pretend to be charmed as he makes unfunny jokes and carries on like a middle-aged wacko. Which brings us back to the age thing. The familiar Carrey routine may have suited a young man but hes 46 now and standing next to the 28-year-old Deschanel he looks every minute of it. Moreover the movie places his character Carl within a group of friends in which everyone is no more than 35 implying that Carl is supposed to be in his early 30s. A 46-year-old man doesnt normally register as Methuselah but present him as though he were 32 and give him a 28-year-old girlfriend (who looks 23) and things get awkward. On top of that have him act in a way that in real life would probably scare women not seduce them and a funny (as in strange) thing starts to happen in the audience Arm hair stands up. Skin tingles and crawls. People sink into their seats. They feel their facial muscles tightening. They are wincing. Wincing and cringing. However there is one genuinely funny performance in ""Yes Man"" worthy of note - not Carreys but that of Rhys Darby who plays Carls openhearted incredibly geeky Harry Potter-loving boss. As sometimes happens with actors who are especially vivid I thought for sure Id seen Darby before but ""Yes Man"" marks Darbys feature debut. From there on its all uphill. -- Advisory This film contains adult humor and the sight of Carreys posterior peeking through a hospital gown.

After decades of giving and taking punishment in a sport that isnt a sport hes got a split bicep a cracked clavicle a deaf ear wrecked knees and assorted other body parts that hurt as he puts it wryly only when he breathes. On top of that he hates himself with merciless passion. Its almost another miracle then that the director Darren Aronofsky and the writer Robert D. Siegel have turned the story of this washed-up faux gladiator into a film of authentic beauty and commanding consequence. ENLARGE Mickey Rourke is shown in a scene from The Wrestler. Associated Press/Fox Searchlight Certain scenes are hard to watch since the truth of pro wrestling is more complicated than mere fakery. The matches are staged to be sure with stagecraft that can involve appallingly elaborate torture rituals. Yet much of the suffering is real as ""The Wrestler"" demonstrates graphically; its consensual torture with such sado-masochist tools as barbed wire broken glass forks and staple guns. So avert your gaze if you must from time to time but not for too long because Mickey Rourke a gifted actor whos had his own massive career problems is suddenly back in full force with a phenomenal performance that takes pain as a starting point and quickly transcends it. Something of the same can be said of the director. His mysterious debut feature ""Pi"" announced the arrival of a singular talent and the promise was confirmed by the brutal power of ""Requiem for a Dream."" Then came ""The Fountain"" a turgid fantasy about eternal life that might have knocked a lesser talent out of the movie business for the career equivalent of eternity. Happily Mr. Aronofsky is back in the ranks of the bankable. ""The Wrestler"" is an imposing entertainment on several counts not the least of them being the scruffy milieu in which the much-diminished Ram grabs occasional matches and signs autographs for fans with long memories. (Maryse Alberti did the high-contrast high-impact cinematography.) For a while the film shapes up as a fairy-tale variation on the theme of ""Rocky."" Randy hopes to revisit his glory days of the late 1980s when he was a superstar on the professional circuit by getting into good enough shape to restage a classic battle with one of his best-known adversaries. Marisa Tomei gives a wonderfully nuanced and affecting performance as Cassidy a stripper whos almost at the end of her own string. (I do wish she hadnt been stuck with a gratuitous speech that draws glib equivalence between the wrestlers suffering and ""The Passion of the Christ."") Evan Rachel Wood is Stephanie the estranged daughter Randy reaches out to as intimations of mortality grow ever louder in his battered head. As fairy tales go however this is a tough-minded one. Pain has become a part of Randys tortured psyche an addictive drug that he treats with other drugs. The ultimate subject of ""The Wrestler"" is personal destiny and whether it can be changed. Seven Pounds Until today the subject of ""Seven Pounds"" has been kept under wraps. A huge marketing push signaled only the imminent arrival of a Will Smith movie starring Will Smith with Will Smith in the main role. Now we know why. And now we know why the star has been looking so mournful in all those trailers display ads and billboards. His latest film is about nothing less than life and death sin and atonement and it takes the soggy cake for multiple layers of sentimentality topped by indigestible grandiosity. That doesnt mean its bound to flop. In a time of diminished star power Mr. Smith is one of the last superstars with a dependably huge following. Still theres been a steady increase in the self-importance quotient of his most recent hits including last years treacly fable ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and last summers bizarre and ponderous ""Hancock."" Moviegoers with more generous spirits than mine may well be stirred by the quasi-religious quotient of ""Seven Pounds"" which was directed by Gabriele Muccino from a screenplay by Grant Nieporte. But Mr. Smith keeps himself so shamelessly at the center of things and the camera dwells so worshipfully on his anguished face that he seems to be anointing himself as the sacred embodiment of his own sermon. The movie begins with his character Ben Thomas in extreme anguish. ""Theres been a suicide"" he tells a 911 operator. When she asks ""Whos the victim?"" he replies ""I am."" This apparently scrambled sequence of tenses can be explained but you wont find the explanation here. Laying out the plots logic such as it is would spoil the suspense such as it is. All I can tell you is that Ben is a man with a fateful mission that the mission requires him to make solemn judgments on the goodness quotient of several individuals that Rosario Dawson plays a woman of unquestionable goodness and that Ben turns the matchlessly lethal venom of a box jellyfish into an instrument of expiation. He keeps the jellyfish in a big tank filled with ordinary tap water which would ordinarily kill the little bugger in no time flat. But a man who makes a movie about life and death gets to make all the rules. Yes Man ENLARGE Jim Carrey in Yes Man. Warner Bros. It would be churlish to naysay ""Yes Man"" so I wont. Jim Carreys new comedy is enjoyable enough for what it is a clever idea developed by fits and starts. And once the premise is established -- rather laboriously -- it works up a head of steam that could pass albeit briefly for inspiration. Mr. Carrey is Carl Allen a junior loan officer who says no to just about everyone and everything. If senior loan officers had followed his example in recent years we might not be in the fix were in but Carls rejectionism springs less from any sense of the mortgage market than from the pain of a lost love. All of this changes as the title suggests when a New Age Elmer Gantry played broadly by Terence Stamp persuades him to embrace life by saying yes to everyone and everything. The possibilities of this comic scheme are endless though not necessarily comic. ""Yes Man"" doesnt come fully to life until Carl meets Allison a kooky free spirit played by Zooey Deschanel. Kookiness isnt necessarily comic either but Ms. Deschanels sexy subtlety and endearing reserve seem to set Mr. Carrey free. Yes is the only correct response to Carls encounter with a would-be suicide and to a trip he takes with Allison to Nebraska. For the rest its a definite maybe.

It wasnt his first feature film but it was the film in which he showed himself to be an exceptional young actor in the company of other exceptional young actors. Among them were Steve Guttenberg Daniel Stern Paul Reiser Kevin Bacon Tim Daly and Ellen Barkin.

"Yes Man Jim Carrey puts the clown shoes back on | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsYes Man Jim Carrey puts the clown shoes back onJim Carrey is eager to please in Yes Man  and talk about life imitating art.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 19 2008 Yes Man (out of 4)Starring Jim Carrey Zooey Deschanel Rhys Darby John Michael Higgins Bradley Cooper Danny Masterson and Terence Stamp. Directed by Peyton Reed. At major theatres. 104 minutes. PG Jim Carrey is eager to please in Yes Man and talk about life imitating art.Necessity prompts him to put the clown shoes back on via a movie that will remind you of his Liar Liar smash of a decade past only with fewer laughs.Hed been seeking more mature roles. But his stock lately has mirrored Wall Streets decline with only the animated Horton Hears a Who providing modest relief from a series of unfortunate movies.On the upside Carrey is every bit as eager as Carl Allen his convert to positive thinking in Yes Man. That actually is Carrey bungee jumping off a bridge at one point. On the downside he strains at times for jokes that once came so effortlessly.Carl is the loans officer for a small Los Angeles bank who thinks his job is to say ""no"" to everybody who asks for money - an attitude spookily in tune with the times. Hes in a perpetually negative mood because of his divorce three years ago and because his boss Norman (Rhys Darby of TVs Flight of the Conchords) has the annoying habit of acting like Mike Myers doing Austin Powers.Carl cant seem to snap out of his funk even though his pals - played by Bradley Cooper Danny Masterson and John Michael Higgins - are exactly the kind of wacky sitcom guys who are supposed to help him make merry.Then he meets a self-help guru played well by Terence Stamp who tells him that his life will change dramatically if he starts saying ""yes"" to everything instead of ""no."" Darned if it doesnt do just that as Carl embarks on escapades that include the aforementioned bungee jumping as well as learning Korean taxiing homeless people and giving out reckless loans. He also takes up with a daffy gal named Allison played by Zooey Deschanel who I believe is required by law to play the daffy chick in at least three movies per year.Some of it is funny. Much of it isnt. The committee-written plot seems tired and recycled - theres even a party scene stolen from Ghostbusters - and its a step backwards for director Peyton Reed who did something different with romantic comedy in The Break-Up. Note that I have resisted the urge to make a joke about Yes Mans title.

Comments Yes Man Jim Carrey is a negative-minded loser who gets roped into a seminar with motivational guru Terence Stamp and emerges from it as a boy who cant say no. This leads to numerous complications at home (his friends all take advantage) and at work (hes a loan officer naturally). But it also opens him up to life--in particular scooter-riding wild child Zooey Deschanel. An interesting Atlantic column by James Parker posits the idea of Carrey as an existential hero which might be more persuasive if his funniest moment here didnt involve him pulling his face into a grotesque mask with adhesive tape. On the other hand its nice to see a high-concept comedy with such a generous concept. Peyton Reed (Down With Love The Break-Up) directed. PG-13 104 min. By J.R.

"He wont give no for an answer - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW Yes Man He wont give no for an answer Jim Carrey plays an antisocial bank-loan officer who changes after attending an affirmation seminar. (melissa moseley) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / December 19 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + In ""Yes Man"" Jim Carrey plays Carl an antisocial Los Angeles bank-loan officer who agrees to stop saying ""no"" - to friends strangers co-workers the homeless; to fun life Mormons even the horny old lady (Fionnula Flanagan) in his apartment complex. He twists shouts does a round of Dance Dance Revolution plans a bridal shower attends what must be the last rave in California learns Korean goes to a Harry Potter costume party and courts Zooey Deschanel.Yet the joys of affirmation appear lost on Carrey who never looks truly happy. Its entirely possible that Im projecting my forced smiles onto Carreys face. But he seems to hold this entire exercise (it is alas a workout) in contempt. Perhaps he thought he was through with these high-concept one-note comedies having failed to top the physical genius of ""Liar Liar"" in 1997 and having made a mild breakthrough of sincerity in 2003s ""Bruce Almighty.""While Carrey was off exploring his dramatic range in movies as radically different as ""Man on the Moon"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and the execrable ""The Number 23"" the landscape for movie clowns changed. He does not belong to the fraternity that has come to dominate Hollywood comedy in this decade. Vince Vaughn Ben Stiller Will Ferrell Owen Wilson on one hand and the writer-director-producer Judd Apatow on the other share a franchise on the genre. Its strange to say but Carrey is an outsider in a rambunctious style he helped create. For ""Yes Man"" he turns in what feels like a Jim Carrey impersonation - 104 minutes of high-energy heartlessness.The gist of it all is that Carl must carpe his diem. He attends a seminar led by a yes guru (Terence Stamp comically smug) where everyone around Carl is happy (or something like it) so why shouldnt he be too? In our pharmaceutical age theres probably a great farce to be made about emotional conformity. This movie directed by Peyton Reed and adapted from Danny Wallaces novel by three writers feels made from quirky-comedy instant mix just add heart. Its a cynical attempt ultimately to make obnoxious people palatable by throwing them into a tub of romantic comedy.Casting Deschanel as The Girl is not the wonderful stroke it once was. Between this film and ""The Happening"" she seems more warmed over than Carrey. Deschanel glides through ""Yes Man"" with a cute haircut and cuter clothes fronts a band called - quirk alert 1 - Munchausen By Proxy (they have a semi-funny song about booty calls) and - quirk alert 2 - teaches a jogging photography class. Weve seen her scoot through this part before in ""Elf"" and ""Failure to Launch."" There are probably a dozen better ways for her to spend her time (although few as lucrative) so it seems too soon for her to be on autopilot. For one thing wheres her ""Yes Woman""?That of course is the biggest problem with this movie - not that its mediocre dull or barely written (though its guilty on all counts). Its that Carrey himself is miscast. This is a star-making part as opposed to a part for a star committing a repeat offense. I watched Carrey ride a Ducati motorcycle in a hospital gown during the climax of this movie and thought about how much more fun it would have been to see a fresher face (Michael Ceras Robert Pattinsons or Paul Danos) do that and all of Carls exclamatory slapstick to see someone care enough to make a character out of this.If Carrey looks resentful or bored it may be because hes made things too easy for himself. He doesnt have to worry about breaking character in ""Yes Man."" Hes not playing one.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www. boston.com/movienation.

" Yes Man stars Jim Carrey Zooey Deschanel Terence Stamp - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies  Yes Man stars Jim Carrey Zooey Deschanel Terence Stamp Michael PhillipsTribune critic The director Peyton Reed is used to working in italics. His ""Down With Love"" (2003) was an entirely italicized movie reworking the plot mechanics and arch visual strategies of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson sex comedies of the late 1950s and early 60s along with Broadway-to-Hollywood adaptations such as ""Sunday in New York"" (1963). It turned out more like a cinematic term paper than a movie but Reeds willingness to go all the way--further than Doris Day ever did at least before the ring and the fade-out--marked him as a director to watch.In ""Yes Man"" hes working with the human italic button known as Jim Carrey who shot to movie fame as Ace Ventura and The Mask characters straight from the cartoon world or the world according to Frank Tashlins live-action comedies. These days (Carrey turns 47 next month) the star isnt going for insanely broad comedy. When he lands the right script as he did with ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" Carrey finds real and touching ways to channel all that energy into a performance as opposed to a performance. ""Yes Man"" starts out wobbly but ends up quite nicely primarily because Carrey has a wonderful acting partner in Zooey Deschanel the singer-actress with the saucer eyes and unpredictable behind-the-beat comic timing. Carrey by nature is a coiled spring; Deschanels a spring thats already sproiiiinged. If she ever co-stars in a movie with Kat Dennings of ""Nick amp; Noras Infinite Playlist"" the world will immediately enter a permanent Zen-like state of calm.Carrey plays Carl Allen an L.A. loan officer at a drab bank stuck with a goon of a superior (Rhys Darby very funny). Carl cant get out of his surly self-pitying rut three long years after his breakup. For the first 20 minutes of ""Yes Man"" which was loosely based on Scottish comedian Danny Wallaces book you think youre in for it. Carrey forces the laughs and the characters an uninteresting sour fellow. Then comes Terence Stamp in his first genuinely funny screen appearance as a self-help guru who challenges his followers to say ""yes"" to every single thing that comes their way. Carl tries it and before long he meets Allison (Deschanel) a bohemian L.A. polyglot whos in a band called Munchausen By Proxy and who teaches classes in ""jogging photography"" i.e. taking photos while jogging. In its tale of an emotional shut-in who learns to embrace life get a pilots license and speak Korean ""Yes Man"" recalls some previous Carrey vehicles notably ""Liar Liar."" (Chris Knight of the National Post newspaper put it this way ""Jim Carrey + oddly constraining superpower = box-office gold"") The tone of ""Yes Man"" isnt predominantly manic however and may throw some die-hard Carrey fans expecting the old shtick in high gear.We dont like our movie stars to change on us and yet they must if theyre to grow as actors. What I enjoyed most here was the interplay between two utterly different leads. Director Reed cant resolve the tensions in a spotty script by Nicholas Stoller Jarrad Paul and Andrew Mogel which feels like a compromise between two (or more) separate drafts one leaning in the direction of farce the other romance.

Pictures Free spirit (Zooey Deschanel) meets elastic-faced guy (Jim Carrey) who just cant say no in Yes Man. ABOUT THE MOVIEYes Man  1/2 out of fourStars Jim Carrey Zooey Deschanel Terence Stamp John Michael Higgins Bradley Cooper Rhys DarbyDirector Peyton ReedDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13 for crude sexual humor language and brief nudityRunning time 1 hour 44 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Yes yes its Liar Liar 2. Yes Man is more than just familiar. It feels downright repetitive. The plot relies on a high concept so similar to that 1997 movie that the audience will get a decided feeling of deja viewed. In the earlier film Jim Carrey played a selfish guy with a chronic habit of lying. He is forced via his sons birthday wish to tell the truth for 24 hours. This time Carrey plays Carl the quintessential naysayer. An increasingly withdrawn loan officer he routinely turns down prospective clients and roundly refuses invitations from friends. Still shattered from the break-up of a relationship more than two years before hes in a rut. A chance encounter with an exuberant and slightly unhinged friend (a funny John Michael Higgins) inspires Carl to attend a self-help seminar. Though he resists he is swept up by the movements charismatic guru (Terence Stamp) and makes a covenant to seize opportunities and respond affirmatively to all requests. The first involves giving a ride to a homeless man that leads to a humorous chain of events and a chance meeting with a free-spirited girl (Zooey Deschanel). Carl is convinced that terrible repercussions will ensue if he says no. Illustrating that point is a funny scene involving an encounter with a randy elderly neighbor (Fionnula Flannagan). Fortunately Yes Man though uneven is an improvement over Liar Liar. But as the movie progresses incidents grow more forced and are only sporadically funny. A protracted scene in which he talks a suicidal man (Luis Guzman) off a ledge by playing the guitar becomes a cloying group singalong. Carrey is back to elastic-faced form and zany physical humor. But his efforts feel more manic than comical. His co-stars pick up the slack. Rhys Darby (Murray on HBOs Flight of the Conchords) is weirdly funny as Carls boss. The idea is inspired enough a series of unusual ""yescapades"" a term coined by author Danny Wallace on whose memoir the movie is based. But with Carrey in the lead its freshness seems compromised. Its just too hard to avoid Liar Liar comparisons. It might have been more enjoyable if the lead had gone to someone who could have played it less clownish. This is not to diminish Carrey. But the combination of the familiar scenario and his broadly comic style seems stale. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

"Yes Man reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Yes Man reviewed. Yes Man reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 18 2008 545 PM Slow amp; Slower Jim Carrey looks tired in Yes Man. By Josh Levin Jim Carrey plays Carl in Yes Man Jim Carrey became the worlds most famous comic actor thanks to his stamina for self-torture. Liar Liar a blockbuster from Hollywoods golden age of Carrey exploitation films plays like a kid-friendly Hostel. Carrey falls he gets up. He punches himself in the face he gets up. He smashes himself over the head with a toilet seat he gets up. A decade later the once impossibly nimble comedian is moving more like Mrs. Fletcher the fall-prone spokes-codger for the LifeCall medical bracelet. In the first minutes of Yes Man (Warner Bros.) 46-year-old Carrey smacks into a tray-bearing barmaid and falls creakily to the floor. Theres no spryness in this tumble no hint of the actors customary Gumby-as-overactor persona. Physical comedians age in dog years and Jim Carrey is panting heavily. Its not always fair to compare an actor with his younger self but Yes Mans photocopied plot makes it hard to avoid. Carreys latest is essentially a remake of Liar Liar--rather than a shyster lawyer cursed to tell the truth we have a zonked-out loan officer named Carl Allen who decides to spice up his life by saying yes to everything. Carl becomes a ""yes man"" under the tutelage of a life coach/cult leader (Terence Stamp who gives the guru the necessary trust-me-I-have-a-British-accent quality) named Terrence Bundley who tells his acolytes to ""gobble up all of lifes energies and ... excrete the waste."" At once Carl is a changed man He says yes to a homeless guy who needs a lift to a genial elderly neighbor who offers him fellatio and to a lovely young lady (Zooey Deschanel) who offers him a ride on her scooter. Advertisement While Carrey does the doldrums just fine in the movies morose opening act he doesnt have quite enough oomph to rev up the happy-go-lucky Carl. There is one scene when Carl downs a case of Red Bull during an all-night bender that evokes Jim Carrey The Rubbery Years--the fast talking the manic twitching the insistent mugging. But Jim Carrey gulping Red Bull (even fake Red Bull) is like Barry Bonds taking steroids. Its cheating by someone who used to be the best in the business no enhancements required. If you find Carreys latter-day mien too depressing to bear perhaps its best to think of Yes Man as a Zooey Deschanel vehicle. Despite being forced to inhabit a character infused with Garden State levels of quirkiness--she teaches a jogging photography class and plays ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" on the keytar--Deschanel keeps things light and frothy as Carrey flails away. The singer-actress also gets a chance to show off her pipes belting out a synth-pop ballad with the refrain ""Im not your late-night booty call."" Its my early favorite for Oscars song of the year--suck it Bruce Springsteen. If you want to see Zooey Deschanel sing and act though you should probably just listen to She amp; Him and rent All the Real Girls. Despite the charming presence of Deschanel Yes Man cant overcome its pervasive drowsiness or its failure to care about its own high concept. Yes the guy who says yes to everything doesnt always say yes to everything. When a suicidal fellow played by Luis Guzman asks Carl not to talk him down from the ledge he ignores the plea and leads a crowd of onlookers in a rendition of Third Eye Blinds ""Jumper."" How does a one-joke movie forget its only joke? Perhaps Yes Mans writers got confused by the films tag line ""Yes Is the New No."" In honor of that convoluted axiom heres my one-word review. Should you go see Yes Man? Yes. Josh Levin is Slates executive editor. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

Soon hes giving cash to a bum learning Korean talking a man off a ledge and wooing a punk rocker (Zooey Deschanel) he would never have met without his new ""philosophy."" This is basically a nerd-loosening-his-tie romantic comedy done in the manic-compulsive mode of Liar Liar. It has more chuckles than guffaws though maybe because Carrey has always been a comic actor who says yes yes yes. Literalizing that impulse only robs it of surprise. B?

Yes Man Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2008) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/yes-man-2008,200,yesman23,yesman,rogerebert
"Yes Man | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; yes-man ) Yes Man (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli At first glance Yes Man appears to be yet another high-concept Jim Carrey comedy. After all the premise can be summed up in a sentence ""A character played by Carrey in zany form must say yes to every proposal."" Over the years we have gotten used to these kinds of movies from the guy who was once best known as a Pet Detective so one could not be faulted for assuming that Yes Man would be a lot like Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty in tone and intent. However while a viewer might be expecting a screwball he/she ends up with a changeup. Because despite all the funnyman Carrey trappings this is in essence a fairly generic romantic comedy. Carrey does enough mugging at the beginning to fool us into thinking Yes Man is something other than what it is but the minute Zooey Deschanel appears the movie takes a left turn. Deschanel isnt just a token female love interest in a Carrey movie. Shes a legitimate romantic foil. And that makes the movie a little different from how its being sold. The success of a romantic comedy is tied to the two leads. Basically all you need is two actors who play well off each other and a screenplay that gets out of their way. For the most part thats what Yes Man provides. The writing isnt great and the comedy is of the hit-and-miss variety that characterizes many of Carreys movies but he and Deschanel click. So when theyre together we tend to forget the clumsy over-the-top premise and the awkwardness of some of the secondary characters. Instead were given two lonely people meeting by accident connecting discovering that they like being with one another and going on a vacation to Lincoln Nebraska. In recent years Carrey has been expanding his cinematic repertoire trying different roles that fans would not have expected from him back when he was hotter than fire in the early 90s. However the more contained Carrey is the better his performance. Here after some opening nods to his ""old self"" he settles down to play a mostly straightforward romantic comedy leading man. I have always believed Deschanel to be underrated as an actress. Yes she was terrible in The Happening and even worse in the unreleased Gigantic but All the Real Girls and Winter Passing show what shes capable of. She avoids overacting. Shes low-key in the best sense of the word and lets her expressive eyes convey a lot of what her character is feeling. Flamboyance may win Oscar nominations but this kind of performance is truer in capturing the essence of the character. In Yes Man she and Carrey have it - the chemistry (the word is overused but appropriate) necessary for the romantic aspects of the movie to gain traction. Carl Allen (Carrey) is a ""no man"" - someone who says ""no"" to every opportunity and would never dream of doing anything spontaneous. Thats when an old pal (John Michael Higgins) drags him to a seminar presided over by the new-age guru-ish Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp) who preaches about the power of ""Yes"" and encourages Carl to enter into a covenant whereby he will say ""yes"" to everything. Things dont start out well however. He gives all his money to a homeless man and ends up on a hike to a gas station after his car runs dry. But things take a turn for the better when he meets Allison (Deschanel) a woman who is in many ways his complete opposite and in other ways his perfect match. He finds that he cant say ""no"" to her - until she asks one tricky question. One of the best things Yes Man does is give the leads enough screen time together to make their growing attraction believable. A growing trend in recent romantic comedies is to clutter the story with so many extraneous elements that the protagonists have only a few token scenes in each others company. The film also provides a nice satire of near-religious self-help philosophies and Terence Stamp is the perfect spokesperson - creepy yet strangely compelling. The films final scene reminds us forcefully of the moral from the parable of ""The Emperors New Clothes."" The best sequence in the film may be the unplanned vacation to Nebraska which is suffused with a strange aura of magic. Speaking of magic there are enough nods to Harry Potter that this could almost be seen as 2008s unofficial replacement for rescheduled The Half-Blood Prince. Carrey as Harry? Deschanel as Hermione? The humor which isnt as pervasive as we have come to expect from Jim Carrey movies has its highs and its lows. The least appealing scene involves an elderly woman dentures and oral sex (you can fill in the blanks). Its surprising that the vulgarity of this gag didnt earn the film an R-rating but trying to figure out the MPAA these days is an exercise in futility. (Slumdog Millionaire anyone?) Some of Carreys physical humor is amusing if not inspired although he apparently suffered cracked ribs as a result of one particular stunt. No one is going to argue that Yes Man is Oscar-caliber material but it fills a necessary lower-brow niche when there are so many prestige offerings on screens. Just as during the summer when its nice to get something smart to provide relief from the non-stop barrage of spectacle so its pleasant to watch something a little less intellectually taxing between all the would-be Oscar contenders. Yes Man is that movie - undemanding light and enjoyable on its own terms.

December 19 2008 ""Yes Man"" Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is stuck in a rut with his negative ways but a self-help seminar led by Terence Stamp teaches him to unleash the power of yes. (Warner Bros.) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic ""Yes is the new no."" in Yes Man a Jim Carrey comedy that has him covering much the same ground he did in Liar Liar. Its an often engaging romance shot through with sweetness a movie that hangs on a handful of simple magical scenes.The first comes when Carl Allen a morose divorced loner of a loan officer who has let ""no"" rule his life lets himself be talked into attending a self-help seminar. In a room full of delirious ""YES"" shouting cultists Carl is confronted by The Yes Man himself Terrence Bundley. The great Terence Stamp -- and his menacing owlish eyes of many a movie villain -- hurls himself at Carl urging/ordering him to ""embrace the possible. Say yes to everything"" And the movie based on a Danny Wallace book written by Carrey collaborators and directed by the klutz who botched The Break-Up proceeds to show us the wondrous possibilities in that free-spirited philosophy and its limitations.Carl says ""yes"" to giving a bum a lift. He lets the guy use his phone (John Michael Higgins is the yes ""sponsor"" who nags Carl into this). That leads to running out of gas with a dead phone and a sparks-flying first meeting with Allison a real free spirit played by Zooey Deschanel. Phony free-spirit Carl signs up for guitar lessons and Korean language classes. He responds to spam from Persianwifefinder.com. He says ""yes"" to a Harry Potter theme party thrown by his needy nerdy boss (Rhys Darby). And he approves loans every hair-brained business or personal loan pitch that crosses his desk.All this spontaneity leads to another magic moment -- a ""Lets sneak into the Hollywood Bowl and sing"" scene with Allison that climaxes with an adorable Beatles duet sung on an empty stage.Everything Carl embraces pays personal dividends. Well almost everything. And every time he says ""no"" the karma goes bad.Deschanel she of the quirky timing and quirkier bangs is perfectly cast as a scooter-driving flake who fronts a band named Munchausen by Proxy and leads a jogging photography club (they shoot pictures while they run). She gives the movie a shot at being as romantic as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It isnt sadly. Yes Man attempts to update the 46-year-old comic genius for a ruder cruder Judd Apatow-Frat Pack comedy universe. The film surrounds him with less funny ""pals"" (Bradley Cooper of Wedding Crashers and Danny Masterson of That 70s Show) injects one funny but off-key sex-with-the-elderly joke and tries to make Carrey a brilliant soloist an ensemble player.Its the soloist who delivers the third magical moment here as Carl uses his guitar lessons to sing a suicidal man ( Luis Guzman) off a ledge. Carreys comedy is aggressive but sweet. The Apatow style is crude with a hint of sweet. They dont quite mesh.The script caves in on itself when the multiple writers (one an Apatow alum) conjure up artificial obstacles to the romance and the pitfalls of living your life through self-help slogans. And there arent enough Bruce Almighty/Liar Liar Carrey set-pieces to give this the zing of those his last wholly formed comedies.But its great to see the funnyman switch off the glum and the grim -- The Number 23 anyone? -- and embrace the comically possible again. Lets hope he says ""yes"" to a few more funny films before he ages out of them altogether.

Will he overplay his shtick his trademark manic mugging at every possible turn (think Ace Ventura Pet Detective)? Or will he dial it down a few notches and show the actual talent that he so often buries (think Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)? He happily manages to bridge the gap in Yes Man a surprisingly winning comedy based on Danny Wallaces book about a closed-off man who says yes to everything. That man is Carrey as Carl Allen a junior loan officer at a bank who after the break-up of his marriage becomes a loner of the first order preferring nights alone with rented videos to spending time with anyone. He says no to everything be it a guy handing out fliers for local bands to customers applying for small-business loans. His best friend Peter (Bradley Cooper) has little success in drawing him out but a chance meeting with an old acquaintance (John Michael Higgins) leads him to a seminar with cultlike overtones led by Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp) - the cult of yes. In a scene downright creepy for its attention to snake-oil salesman detail Carl agrees to say yes to everything a decision that at first seems disastrous but as one might expect leads to bigger and better things. First and foremost is his meeting Allison (Zooey Deschanel) a free-spirited sort who performs with a band with the inspired name Munchausen by Proxy that seems to be at least half performance-art ensemble. She also leads a class in jogging photography - that is not taking pictures of joggers but taking pictures while you jog. Whatever. If you get caught up in details in a movie like this you may never get out alive. The point rather obviously is that its important to open yourself up to possibilities something that Carl was closed to in his former nay-saying life. So now hes fighting in bars taking flying lessons learning to speak Korean. And hes enjoying life with Allison his membership in Persianbridefinder.com notwithstanding. Actually his relationship with Faranoosh (Anna Khaja) his would-be bride is an example of what makes the movie work. It could be a one-off joke but its not. Director Peyton Reed doesnt abandon her but works her into several scenes; Reed trusts the audience to play along and accept her presence. It makes the movie a lot funnier and a lot better. Thats the secret to the films success in fact - Reed sells the absurdity around the margins completely which tones down Carreys performance by comparison. Rhys Darby for instance from HBOs brilliant Flight of the Conchords plays Carls boss a pathetic sort who hosts social black-hole events like Harry Potter-themed costume parties. OK fine. What elevates Yes Man isnt the losers on parade at the party but the never-introduced little guy wearing some sort of creature outfit who sits through showings of the Potter films never removing his mask. Hes always just sort of . . . there at the edge of the screen and if you bother to notice it eventually becomes really funny. Deschanel is charming enough but playing a free spirit in a film with Jim Carrey is a tall order. Yet Carrey comes off more genuine than usual finding the humor in Carls transformation without overdoing it (much). Is Yes Man worth the trouble then? Not to belabor the point but yes.

And hey it works Really well because his first terrible decision--to give a homeless man all his money--turns out to be a stroke of good fortune as Carl is rescued by perky spontaneous Allison (Zooey Deschanel) a singer in an avant-rock band called Munchausen by Proxy and the instructor of a jogging-photography class. How quirky Theirs quickly blossoms into a romance defined by its random acts of wackiness including a flight to Lincoln Nebraska . . . just because its there. Inevitably Carl winds up in the stands of a Nebraska-Oklahoma football game his body covered in red and white paint. See what saying ""yes"" to anything will get you? Turns a 46-year-old man into a frat boy. (See also Will Ferrell.) After Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and even 2005s Fun With Dick and Jane remake Carrey seemed destined for far more grown-up roles; hed transitioned from the slapshticky surreal to the unexpectedly real. But Yes Man is nothing more than warmed-over holiday seconds a repackaged best-of for those who already own the hits.

In the spectrum of Jim Carrey vehicles ""Yes Man"" hews closest structurally to ""Liar Liar"" offering the rubber-faced comic actor plenty of opportunities to riff -- but with far too few moments that approach the explosive hilarity of that earlier movie. Genial but slim pic is certainly a light-hearted alternative to weighty year-end awards bait but the conceit isnt realized fully enough to ensure the affirmative response Warner Bros. would doubtless like to hear. As is its more in the realm of a definite ""maybe."" Carrey is introduced as Carl Allen a sad-sack bank-loan officer who still hasnt recovered emotionally from his divorce three years before. Although his pals Peter (Bradley Cooper) and Rooney (Danny Masterson) try to nudge him out of his shell Carls answer to virtually every overture that involves anything but staying home and renting DVDs is an evasive ""no."" A chance encounter with an old acquaintance inspires him to attend a self-help seminar where a steely-eyed guru (Terence Stamp) preaches the power of saying ""yes"" to every opportunity -- forging a covenant with the shell-shocked Carl to adhere to this simple code. To his surprise the ""just say yes"" strategy yields welcome results -- and equally significant failing to do so invites disaster. Carls grudging agreement to assist a homeless guy for example inadvertently brings about his introduction to Allison (Zooey Deschanel) a free spirit to whom hes instantly drawn (in a faint echo of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") -- and thanks to his newfound attitude with whom hes very much in tune. Similarly unquestioningly approving bank loans to eccentric characters -- the timing of which could probably be better given the present mortgage meltdown -- benefits Carl in unexpected ways if not quite triggering the logical ""pay it forward"" scenario that would help lend ballast to this slender premise. Instead director Peyton Reed (""The Break-Up"") -- working from an adaptation of Danny Wallaces book by Nicholas Stoller Jarrad Paul and Andrew Mogel -- lets the movie lapse into an uneven episodic mode. That format yields the occasional juicy bits (Carl thwarting a suicide attempt; an interlude with his aged neighbor played by Fionnula Flanagan) but not enough of them to sustain the level of manic energy Carrey can unleash at his best. Almost too conveniently the propositions thrown Carls way also generally avoid anything thats so uncomfortable as to risk brushing up against the limitations of a PG-13 rating. In terms of concocting laughs Carrey receives minimal help other than from Rhys Darby (HBOs ""Flight of the Conchords"") as his nerdy boss who has a fondness for idiotic nicknames and throws movie-themed parties seemingly catering to fringes of the Comic-Con crowd. (Those scenes amusingly if somewhat conspicuously showcase Warner Bros. properties including the ""Harry Potter"" franchise -- also from ""Yes Man"" producer David Heyman -- and ""300."") From a technical standpoint the movie makes unusually good use of Los Angeles landmarks as a backdrop for Carl and Allisons budding romance from the Hollywood Bowl to the Griffith Observatory. Mark Oliver Everett of the band Eels collaborated on the score and contributes several songs. Mercifully ""Yes Man"" finally arrives at a place that lets a bit of air out of the pervasive self-help bubble. Its only too bad that the movie isnt slightly more adept at helping itself.
