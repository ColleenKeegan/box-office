Theyve all been living in Hollywood too long. The accumulated wisdom this movie has to impart--relationships take work you know and commitment--could have been learned sitting in front of a week of TV sitcoms.Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis play the couple under scrutiny Katie and Ben Jordan. A comfortable L.A. couple with two kids a nice home and a handful of the usual comic-sidekick best friends this once happy couple does nothing but bicker bicker bicker. She complains that shes the ""designated driver"" of the relationship. He wonders where the wacky girl he fell in love with has gone. Both actors are capable of giving us complex flesh-and-blood characters but you wont find them here. What we see are two movie stars playing a generic couple in a movie so bland and un-lived in you want to pour Tabasco all over the screen. Will they get back together? One guess. Do we care? Not a bit. Nothing is at stake here except Reiners rapidly dwindling reputation as an observer of (so-called) life.

Starring Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer . Directed by Rob Reiner . (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There is a desperate phoniness about director Rob Reiners ""The Story of Us."" The emotions are phony. The conversations are phony. The relationships are phony. Even that blond scab of a hairpiece that Bruce Willis wears is obviously and ridiculously a phony. This is a problem in a film called ""The Story of Us."" Its a movie about a troubled marriage that aspires to be about troubled marriages in general. Anyone so naive as to turn to Hollywood for a wise and honest statement about marriage deserves this film. Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer play Ben and Katie who are married with two children. With her puffy lips locked in a perpetual frown Pfeiffer lets us know that Katie hates Ben. He cant make a move If hes happy she undercuts it. If he complains she screams at him then goes into a sulk. Since ""The Story of Us"" is not intended as a film about what its like to be married to a horrid shrew it seems a bit unbalanced. What had Ben done to become an object of loathing? Did he squander their life savings at a roulette table? No. Bens only problem is that he is too happy- go-lucky and leaves Katie in charge of the household. Which brings up another point. These people have money. Lots of it. When Ben and Katie separate he rents what looks like a mansion for himself and furnishes it without batting an eye. So why doesnt Katie have a housekeeper or nanny? In ""The Story of Us"" Katie and Ben are middle-class when it suits the filmmakers and rich when the screenwriters (Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson) dont want to be inconvenienced by details. The picture which opens today takes place over the course of one summer. The kids are away at camp and the couple uses the time for a trial separation. The movie intersperses scenes from the present with scenes of Ben and Katies courtship and early days of marriage. One thing the movie accomplishes It shows how arguments can flare up out of nowhere and become shouting matches. Pfeiffer and Willis are convincingly married in those moments. The stars look quite mortal and small here and thats also nice. But that plus a stray observation on how couples communicate in bed by touching feet is all the film has to recommend it. The movies most inexcusable failing is that despite all the flashbacks we never get a sense of what this relationship was like when it worked. We are never given a single reason to believe these people should stay together. Worse the movie doesnt seem even to have a sense of what a good relationship might be like. One of the films sage pronouncements ""Love is just lust in disguise."" Sure it is -- for 15-year-olds and Hollywood morons. Director Reiner appears in an unwelcome supporting role as Bens friend. At one point he observes that a rear-end is an illusion that its really the top parts of two legs. In the same way love is an illusion . . . Be warned Writing this awful can make a person ill. The picture offers each star a set piece a restaurant freak-out for Willis and a long gushing speech for Pfeiffer. Katies outpouring sounds like something written very quickly and then edited only for rhythm. Its fake goods all the way. Reiner compounds dishonest writing with dishonest direction. Though Katie gushes to her husband within earshot of her kids he never cuts to the children for their reactions. In fact he tries to make us believe the kids didnt hear a thing. Its typical of ""The Story of Us"" which is not really about marriage. Its about Kodak moments. ..

"The Story of Us Take My Husband Please Along With His Apron October 15 1999 FILM REVIEW The Story of Us Take My Husband Please Along With His Apron Related Articles The New York Times on the Web Current Film Video Selected Scenes From the Film The Story of Us Forum Join a Discussion on Current Film By JANET MASLIN he Story of Us"" offers such an arthritic vision of middle-aged marriage that it feels like the first Jack Lemmon comedy made expressly for the baby boom generation. Perhaps that would explain the casting of Bruce Willis as a jokey but sensitive suburban Dad and Michelle Pfeiffer as his beleaguered spouse. The stars variously directed by Rob Reiner to kid around look wistful or scream so hard that their necks turn red are not helped by the films elbow-in-the-ribs humor or its overbearing tactics. Though it sets out to explain why this marriage is worth saving ""The Story of Us"" could prompt even single members of the audience to file for divorce. The ""us"" of the title are Katie and Ben Jordan. They have been married long enough to regard concern about the level of windshield wiper fluid in the family station wagon (shes careful he isnt) as a revealing character trait. They have two young teen-age children and at family meals everybody chimes in and makes a game of listing the high and low points of the day. ""Dinner and dancing"" is Mom and Dads idea of a great way to spend their anniversary. If an air of unreality accompanies this it should. Katie and Ben are actually all but estranged and just keeping up appearances for the childrens sake. Then while the children go to summer camp the parents separate and have a chance to review all the highs and lows of their life together. This is accomplished with the help of flashbacks involving a criminal set of wigs and hairpieces (never has Willis pate been crowned by anything that looks less like human hair) and such kicky memories as the time Ben ran around the kitchen wearing nothing but an apron. The camera is mercifully discreet. As written by Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson and larded with references to sigmoidoscopy prostate trouble orthodontia tree surgery and the caulking of bathroom tile ""The Story of Us"" means to illustrate the workaday realities that hold the Jordans together. That would be harmless enough if the film didnt insist on trumpeting its insights at top volume relying on heavy shtick and turning its characters into clowns. One especially horrible scene finds Katie having lunch with two other wives played by Julie Hagerty and Rita Wilson who are eager to talk about how to avoid sex with their husbands. When Ms. Wilsons character suggests that if one husband had behaved better his wife ""would have sounded the trumpets opened the gates and welcomed the troops home for Christmas"" she personifies the films light touch. Many of the films characters sound like aging Catskills comedians. (Tim Matheson as a dentist and single father remarks about sending his son to camp ""Oh please The minute my Kevin gets off that bus its goodbye bite plate"") Many also play their roles with Reiners familiar hand-waving mannerisms which are funnier when they come straight from him. The score by Eric Clapton and Marc Shaiman features a light samba that would not be out of place in a Las Vegas lounge act. Sets of married friends imagine one another as Fred and Ethel Mertz. Just when the whole film is at its creakiest Willis and Ms. Pfeiffer are joined in one scene by Tom Poston Jayne Meadows Betty White and Red Buttons as their parents. (The latter two sing ""Dont Sit Under the Apple Tree With Anyone Else but Me."") Not even in this company do Ben and Katie seem young at heart. PRODUCTION NOTES THE STORY OF US Rating The Story of Us is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes mild profanity and a shot of Willis bare posterior. Directed by Rob Reiner; written by Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson; director of photography Michael Chapman; edited by Robert Leighton; music by Eric Clapton and Marc Shaiman; production designer Lilly Kilvert; produced by Reiner Ms. Nelson and Zweibel; released by Universal Pictures.

More somber than humorous tale is burdened by a complicated time scheme of flashbacks and flashforwards that will prevent audiences from being involved in -- and entertained by -- the endless bickering and occasional reconciliations of the duo. Following ""Ghosts of Mississippi"" his disappointing foray into political drama Rob Reiner returns to themes closer to home in ""The Story of Us"" a seriocomic anatomy of a 15-year marriage between two bright and attractive partners credibly played by Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis. More somber than humorous tale is burdened by a complicated time scheme of flashbacks and flashforwards that will prevent audiences from being involved in -- and entertained by -- the endless bickering and occasional reconciliations of the duo. Its doubtful that Willis B.O. clout will help the commercial prospects of a film that suffers from repetitive ideas and images. Opening in a crowded and competitive marketplace Universal release should have a modest opening and brief theatrical run with a brighter future in ancillary venues and on the small screen. The filmmakers seem to believe they are conveying deep emotional and universal truths about how to survive a long-enduring marriage beyond the initial phases of romantic love and passion. But as conceived by scripters Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson this small film is merely tolerable. Leads are likable but can elevate only to a point the uneven material which ranges from sharply observed scenes to downright embarrassing and schmaltzy ones. Yarn begins with writer Ben Jordan (Willis) sitting on a sofa and declaring to the camera his philosophy of life -- his firm belief in staying together and happy endings. This is contrasted with a tense dinner scene in which Ben his wife Katie (Pfeiffer) and their two children discuss the highs and lows of their days a routine that serves as a motif for the picture. About to celebrate their 15th anniversary the Jordans have grown apart; their chief dilemma seems to be how to maintain the facade of a unified family for their children. Rather conveniently the script arranges for the kids to be sent to summer camp so that their parents can understand what has gone wrong -- specifically to wrestle with the paradox of how the very qualities that made them fall in love in the first place are now pulling them apart. Emotionally drained by their frustrating sexless relationship they attempt a trial separation and each retreats in silence to his/her corner Katie stays in the house and Ben moves to a nearby hotel. Story unfolds as a series of brief reflections on their shared history from their first charming meeting in an office to the present when each is in bed waiting for the other to call. Through the duos voiceover narration we learn that Katie has become the ""designated driver"" of the marriage based on her need for stability and order. Her career as a designer of crossword puzzles was motivated by her need to have answers to lifes ""little questions."" In contrast Ben is a writer blessed with imagination spontaneity and playfulness which complement Katies rationality and efficiency. The ins and outs of the marriage and the difficulties of staying together are not related in chronological order and for a while its fun to deduce the era of a scene by the couples clothes and hairdos. There are brief snippets of their wedding sex on the kitchen table babies birthdays New Years and so on. Problem is that the stylistic devices used which recall early Woody Allen and Paul Mazursky get increasingly tedious disrupting not only the sequence of events but also squelching audience sympathy for the protagonists. There are too many voiceovers and flashbacks and all the films elements are arranged symmetrically or in parallels If Ben is meeting his buddies in a diner the next scene will show Katie and her friends in a restaurant. Every once in a while Reiners TV-actor background sneaks into the film as in a poorly orchestrated montage of the various shrinks the couple consulted each more eccentric than the last. At one point the Jordans are told that when they have sex there are actually six people in their bed themselves Bens folks (Red Buttons and Betty White) and Katies (Jayne Meadows and Tom Poston). Sure enough Reiner clutters their bed with six people engaged in overlapping dialogue. Just when the story becomes dreary the film for good measure sends the couple to Venice for romantic renewal and the next sequence becomes a tourist travelogue. The novelty of ""The Story of Us"" may be its realistic attention to the details that lead to such marital trauma but that doesnt necessarily make for an involving or entertaining picture. With the exception of the ending all the interesting ideas are exposed in the first two reels. In its good moments pic feels like an American version of the kind of film that almost every French director has made from Sautet and Rohmer to Truffaut and Chabrol. Unlike such Gallic works ""The Story of Us"" like its title is literal earnest and therapeutic. The tales big lessons -- that marriage consists of both the magical and challenging times and that relationships fall apart as a result of the day-to-day grind not the big momentous events -- should not surprise any mature viewer. Drawing on her beauty and dramatic range Pfeiffer delivers a compelling performance though her big monologue at the end is not as effective as it should be. In a role reversal as a man whos more emotionally demonstrative than his wife Willis is also good. Most of the secondary characters are one-dimensional used for comic relief including Reiner as a man who speaks in metaphorical terms; Rita Wilson cast against type as loud foul-mouthed and opinionated; and Tim Matheson as a sensitive divorced man who takes cooking lessons. Production values are proficient but unexceptional including the visuals of ace lenser Michael Chapman which dont measure up to his work for Scorsese and others. A melodic Eric Clapton song frames the film lending it the proper sweet-and-sour tone. The Story of UsProductionA Universal release of a Castle Rock Entertainment presentation.

The Story of Us...The Story of UsRomance Comedy DramaR Psychologists always say that its healthy for a couple to fight but somehow it doesnt feel that way when youre fighting. The Story of Us...1999-10-22 A- The Story of Us Genre Romance Comedy Drama; Starring Michelle Pfeiffer Bruce Willis; Director Rob Reiner; MPAA Rating R Posted October 22 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT Psychologists always say that its healthy for a couple to fight but somehow it doesnt feel that way when youre fighting. The Story of Us Rob Reiners pungent funny and surprisingly forceful new movie follows an embattled Los Angeles couple Ben and Katie Jordan (Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer) who have been together for 15 years but have stopped recognizing the goodness they share. When they go at each other -- as they do for most of the film -- the conflicts have a testy directness thats snappish enough to wound. In one of the best scenes the two have just returned from a romantic holiday in Venice. Their first night back they compose a cuddly letter to their two kids who are off at camp. Within minutes the conversation is dotted with grace notes of dissatisfaction which grow steadily louder until theyve drowned out everything else. Should Ben and Katie have sex now or after they finish the letter? Was Katie more spontaneous in Venice? Was the vacation a charade? ""I just dont want us to get to the point"" says Ben ""where we cant make love unless theres a concierge downstairs."" The argument isnt really about sex of course. Its about power -- about whose will is going to prevail. (Well okay its about sex too.) When you go to a Rob Reiner film you know that its going to have the brightly lit overly patterned surface of an episodic television show. Everything in The Story of Us is spelled out for the audience and the film works so hard to portray the Jordans as ""normal"" multitasking representatives of American e-commerce suburbanism that it sometimes treads a thin line between the universal and the cliche. There are flashes of caricature (like a montage of buffoonish therapists) as well as cutesy touches such as Katies profession Shes a crossword puzzle designer. Yet Reiner working from an adventurously structured script by Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson creates something unexpected a marital romance. He traces the squabbles the war-weary cocooning and the potential destruction of this relationship on its own fractious moment-to-moment terms. What with jobs kids and the white noise of responsibility the Jordans have fallen out of one kind of love and into another. Fed up with playacting the two undergo a separation and the film follows the weeks in which they figure out whether to make the break permanent. The Story of Us evokes a paradox of marriage -- namely that Ben and Katie are drawn to each other for the very complementary qualities that also make them rivals. It would be a more resonant movie if we saw those qualities rather than just being told about them but Willis as an effusive workaday dreamer who lacks discipline and Pfeiffer as the mature one whos too fixed on keeping his impracticalities in check get to project the fullness of their personalities. (Pfeiffers final speech is a smiling-through-tears rouser.) Both actors are terrific They let us see how only two people who share this deep a bond could connect so intimately through anger. The Story of Us isnt exactly Scenes From a Marriage but in its own glossy way it catches the alternating currents of affection and pride resentment and passion that bind people together even as theyre being torn apart.
