Murray Abraham LeVar Burton Michael Dorn Jonathan Frakes Gates McFadden Marina Sirtis Brent Spiner Patrick Stewart; Director Jonathan Frakes; Release Date Wide 12/11/1998; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted January 8 1999 -- 1200 AM EST Even if Kevin Williamsons name werent on the script of the high school alien-parasite thriller The Faculty youd still associate it with him. The movie plays like the work of a smart young hack whod watched the Scream films and Dawsons Creek and figured that it couldnt be all that hard to come up with his own crew of nonchalantly downbeat (and overarticulate) teenagers. Theres a playful contradiction at the heart of Williamsons characters who speak in an exhibitionistic flurry of pop references in order to assert their rebel identity and soul. Theyre desperate to distinguish themselves from the horde yet all they have to deploy are the styles and attitudes of the infotainment-consumer culture. Their ""individuality"" is really the ultimate status symbol. In The Faculty the umpteenth update of Invasion of the Body Snatchers a mysterious otherworldly visitor arrives on the campus of rural Ohios Herrington High where it proceeds to take over the teachers (most entertainingly a discombobulated Jon Stewart) and then infiltrate the student body. Who among the kids could be the reigning host? Is it the snarling faux-lesbian punkette (Clea DuVall)? The know-it-all troublemaker (Josh Hartnett) whos too cool to use his brains in class? The sweetly virginal Southern belle (Laura Harris) who has just arrived from Atlanta? Or the junior Demi Moore look-alike cheerleader (Jordana Brewster) who presides over the eternal school popularity contest as though she were running a military campaign? If The Faculty were half as witty as Scream it might have used the notion of a cliquish high school vanguards members becoming pods of themselves as a vehicle to satirize the supersubtle role playing of these mall-rat babies. In a strange way though the Williamson of Dawsons Creek is now at odds with Williamson the sophisticated trash joker. Hes become too protective of his characters -- too invested in the earnestness of teen angst to portray it in the scathing parodistic terms a hip horror movie demands. It doesnt help that The Faculty was directed by Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) a specialist in literal-minded slapstick dementia. Rodriguez stages Williamsons thriller/soap opera shenanigans as though he were scurrying through a maze he couldnt wait to reach the end of and by the second half you see why. The Faculty erupts into an exuberantly random F/X blowout a vision of young actors sporting wormy tentacles the size of elephant trunks. Some of this is fun in a low-grade Hellraiser sort of way but it reduces the scripts mildest ambitions to hamburger. In The Faculty its Kevin Williamsons talent that turns into a pod of itself.

Horror/sci-fi teenpic reps a meeting of minds between two talents gonzo action director Robert Rodriguez and ""Scream""-star scenarist Kevin Williamson. Together they make a complete lack of socially redeeming value seem so much fun that ""The Faculty"" might well become a pulp classic. Movies dont come any more review-proof than ""The Faculty"" a rip-snorting hunk of giddy self-aware genre trash. Latest ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" remodel has been cranking up MTV-demographic awareness for months via tie-in commercials for clothier Tommy Hilfiger and with little else in current field to waylay anyone between puberty and college graduation theres no reason (an inconvenient R rating aside) this E-ticket ride shouldnt have em lining up well into early 99. Horror/sci-fi teenpic reps a meeting of minds between two talents gonzo action director Robert Rodriguez and ""Scream""-star scenarist Kevin Williamson whove each made the style-over-substance movies-referencing-movies equation their personal mantra. Together they make a complete lack of socially redeeming value seem so much fun that ""The Faculty"" might well become a pulp classic. Dont expect sober grown-ups (be they critics or other cultural watchdogs) to share the enthusiasm though. Wasting no time whatsoever pic starts cranking immediately with a roid-raging episode on the football field with Coach Willis (Robert Patrick). Afterward he provides some unpleasant surprises for Principal Drake (Bebe Neuwirth) as she locks up their suburban Ohio school in the company of drama teacher Mrs. Olson (Piper Laurie). Next day its business as usual at Herrington High which is to say its like a ""Blackboard Jungle"" comic book with all standard student hierarchies in place and 90s budget cuts making any hope of actual education remote. Brainiac Casey (Elijah Wood) gets stomped daily by myriad bullies; princessy Delilah (Jordana Brewster) rules both the cheerleading squad and school newspaper; her b.f. Stan (Shawn Hatosy) is a star jock whod rather be something kinder-gentler. Punky loner Stokely (Clea DuVall) returns all the hate vibes she gets while sardonic Zeke (Josh Harnett) holds court as everyones drug dealer/manufacturer. Notable new kid in town is friendly blonde Southern belle Marybeth (Laura Harris). Casey discovers a piece of icky tissue on the playing field that does very odd things when moistened in Mr. Furlongs (Jon Stewart) biology class. Then Casey and Stan witness something even stranger in the boys locker room and a blink of an eye later Casey and Delilah narrowly survive more alarming events in the teachers lounge. By now Stokely Zeke and Marybeth have joined this nucleus of previously divided youths who believe something very wrong is going on at the school. Films pace is frantic yet so well-engineered that viewer buys the notion that these students are the only non-""snatched"" bodies left about five minutes hence (as a queasy escape from campus makes clear). Williamson knows contempo auds will accept genre conventions without bothersome plot explication (though that tactic must come across as cheeky rather than just dumb). Therefore where the alien infestation comes from what its ""master plan"" is etc. remain moot MIA details. Nor does it matter whether or not the eventual gross-out creature F/X looks phony (it does) so long as the creatures deployment is exciting (and how). But ""The Faculty"" works hard at mixing a canny cocktail of cineastic in-jokes affectionate teenploitation and high-octane suspense thats as enjoyable as it is impossible to take seriously. Unlike MGMs production-compromised commercially disappointing ""Disturbing Behavior"" earlier this year this similar effort is in full control of its admittedly paper-thin story characters and p.o.v. Results may not be Nobel Prize material but theyre zesty and cogent. Williamson playfully includes subversive narrative elements (at once pro-recreational drug pro-scholastic and anti-homophobic) when not paying key homage to ""The Breakfast Club"" as well as myriad horror/sci-fi classics. As usual dialogue is bright although it is so of-the-moment it should carry an expiration date. For his part helmer-editor Rodriguez delivers another hyperconfident feature-length adrenaline rush albeit one thankfully freed from the more irksome macho-iconatry fixations of his prior studio projects ""Desperado"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn."" With the exception of juve veteran Wood (""The Ice Storm"" ""Deep Impact"") and Ramp;B recording star Usher (cast as a menacing football jock) youthful players are relative unknowns. Each makes a smart impression. Adult roles are contrastingly filled by familiar faces with Laurie Patrick and others joined most memorably on staff by Famke Janssen and Rodriguez regular Salma Hayek. Each gets at least one opportunity to go way over the top with gleeful shape-shifting villainy. Rising fast from indie features lenser Enrique Chediak gives pic an efficient look that recalls 50s sci-fiers in its teasing dependence on shadow play. Other tech credits are solid audio side dominated by the requisite ready-made hit-soundtrack rock tunes. Though it marks a break from unity title-wise ""The Faculty"" is crafty and distinctive enough to rate full inclusion in the honor roll of ""Body Snatcher"" versions to date by Don Siegel Philip Kaufman and Abel Ferrara.

Here are the paranoia and parasitism of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. There are the slimy sharp-toothed creatures of Alien. And over there are the movie-wise teen-agers of Scream. The list could be extended but the point is clear this mediocre sci-fi horror film about an Ohio high school being taken over by thirsty space aliens intent on world domination breaks no new ground. But it has an engaging cast with half a dozen appealing young actors playing the roles of teen-agers who are all that stand between the Midwestern monsters and the end of the world as certain moviegoers know it. In one of the films wittier passages the six high school students puzzling out the mysteries of a small new creature found on a football field a teachers corpse in a closet and a sudden outbreak of docility among their normally brutish and dysfunctional schoolmates speculate that paranoid movies of the past may have been part of a plot to soften up the public for the real invasion of the body snatchers. By contrast The Faculty directed by Robert Rodriguez whose credits include El Mariachi and Desperado and written by the ubiquitous Kevin Williams of the Scream movies and other adolescent adventures opens with a clunky bloody cheap-thrills sequence that colors what happens afterward with triteness. So the chief pleasures of the film such as they are remain the actors Jordana Brewster as Delilah the beauteous tart-tongued cheerleader captain and editor in chief of the school newspaper; Shawn Hatosky as Stan her soon-to-be former boyfriend the quarterback and captain of the Herrington High football team who is undergoing a pre-midlife crisis and hanging up his pads; Clea DuVall as Stokely the unhappy loner and science-fiction aficionado whom Delilah taunts as a lesbian; Laura Harris as Marybeth the sweet blond Southern belle who is the new girl in school; Josh Hartnett as the cool Zeke who peddles homemade inhalable substances condoms and fake IDs among other wares but happens to be a science genius and Elijah Wood as Casey the decent little victim of the school bullies who turns out just fine. The adults arent bad either Salma Hayek all but hidden behind her tissues as the sniffling school nurse; Bebe Neuwirth as Principal Drake; Famke Janssen as a seemingly shy teacher; Piper Laurie as a senior faculty member and Robert Patrick (the indefatigable villain of Terminator 2) as the volatile Coach Willis. Herrington High is one of those schools that as Principal Drake explains at the outset has no money for new computers a class trip to New York City or a school musical this year but can come up with cash for all the new football equipment its team needs. The locals she explains are football people. And if The Faculty is the only movie they see his year maybe they can be fooled into believing that it is fresh and frightening. The Faculty is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes bloody violence foul language inhalation of mood-altering substances and nudity. THE FACULTY Directed and edited by Robert Rodriguez; written by Kevin Williamson based on a story by David Wechter and Bruce Kimmel; director of photography Enrique Chediak; music by Marco Beltrami; production designer Cary White; produced by Elizabeth Avellan; released by Dimension Films.

Murray Abraham LeVar Burton Michael Dorn Jonathan Frakes Gates McFadden Marina Sirtis Brent Spiner Patrick Stewart; Director Jonathan Frakes; Release Date Wide 12/11/1998; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted January 8 1999 -- 1200 AM EST Even if Kevin Williamsons name werent on the script of the high school alien-parasite thriller The Faculty youd still associate it with him. The movie plays like the work of a smart young hack whod watched the Scream films and Dawsons Creek and figured that it couldnt be all that hard to come up with his own crew of nonchalantly downbeat (and overarticulate) teenagers. Theres a playful contradiction at the heart of Williamsons characters who speak in an exhibitionistic flurry of pop references in order to assert their rebel identity and soul. Theyre desperate to distinguish themselves from the horde yet all they have to deploy are the styles and attitudes of the infotainment-consumer culture. Their ""individuality"" is really the ultimate status symbol. In The Faculty the umpteenth update of Invasion of the Body Snatchers a mysterious otherworldly visitor arrives on the campus of rural Ohios Herrington High where it proceeds to take over the teachers (most entertainingly a discombobulated Jon Stewart) and then infiltrate the student body. Who among the kids could be the reigning host? Is it the snarling faux-lesbian punkette (Clea DuVall)? The know-it-all troublemaker (Josh Hartnett) whos too cool to use his brains in class? The sweetly virginal Southern belle (Laura Harris) who has just arrived from Atlanta? Or the junior Demi Moore look-alike cheerleader (Jordana Brewster) who presides over the eternal school popularity contest as though she were running a military campaign? If The Faculty were half as witty as Scream it might have used the notion of a cliquish high school vanguards members becoming pods of themselves as a vehicle to satirize the supersubtle role playing of these mall-rat babies. In a strange way though the Williamson of Dawsons Creek is now at odds with Williamson the sophisticated trash joker. Hes become too protective of his characters -- too invested in the earnestness of teen angst to portray it in the scathing parodistic terms a hip horror movie demands. It doesnt help that The Faculty was directed by Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) a specialist in literal-minded slapstick dementia. Rodriguez stages Williamsons thriller/soap opera shenanigans as though he were scurrying through a maze he couldnt wait to reach the end of and by the second half you see why. The Faculty erupts into an exuberantly random F/X blowout a vision of young actors sporting wormy tentacles the size of elephant trunks. Some of this is fun in a low-grade Hellraiser sort of way but it reduces the scripts mildest ambitions to hamburger. In The Faculty its Kevin Williamsons talent that turns into a pod of itself.
