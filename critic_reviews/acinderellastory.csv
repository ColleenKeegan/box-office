Bereaved of her father cash-strapped Sam works in the diner of her vain stepmom while her not-so-ugly stepsisters are lavished with expensive gifts. Sams only comforts are the prospect of college and a date with her mystery cyberpal. The latter comes at a costume ball at which Prince Charming is revealed to be popular schoolmate Austin (Chad Michael Murray) a handsome but none-too-bright lad if his failure to recognise Sam in a dress and an eye mask is anything to go by. Nor does he think to use the mobile phone she drops fleeing at midnight to identify her. While hes scratching his head trying to work out what happened Sam is keeping her head down worrying that he wont accept the class divide between them while anyone above the age of 12 is wondering where the comedy in romantic comedy went.For despite drawing a few easy laughs from Jennifer Coolidges pink and pampered stepmother this fails to use the comic potential inherent in a storyline that has kept panto audiences in stitches for decades. The ugly sisters are stupid and vain in the least amusing way imaginable and Duffs underdog character could use some sharper put-downs. Nevertheless her scrubbed-up everygirl Sam is a likeable presence and the machinations of her makeover are slick enough to please MTV-weaned tots dreaming of a Prince Charming straight out of Dawsons Creek. The rest of us however might wish hed stayed there.

It is horrible. Time curls up and dies while this Hilary Duff vehicle wheels its weary conventional way along. It should be considered as nothing more or less than time spent with cutesie-pootsie Duff who plays Sam a contemporary Cinderella dreaming about finding her prince. In this short-order cook version of the fairy tale she finds herself disinherited from her dearly departed fathers house money and possessions thanks to her you guessed it wicked stepmother (Jennifer Coolidge aka Stiflers mom in ""American Pie"") who has hidden the real will and taken all the loot for herself and two daughters from another marriage. She also makes Sam work in the family-owned diner. Turns out that prince-to-be is the schools star quarterback Austin (Chad Michael Murray) whos the envy of everyone but is consumed with shyness. Austin and Sam have already struck up a mystery-friend e-mail relationship unaware of each others true identity. In one of the movies dumbest conceits both create romantic heat at the masquerade prom party apparently unable to see through each others flimsy disguise. No wonder theyre destined for each other. As for the glass slipper in this movie its a cell phone that Duff drops when she runs away from the prom. Like I said for Duff fans only who are probably getting psyched for her Patriot Center concert this Thursday. Contains mild obscenity and sexual innuendo.

"Skip This Ball Cinderella Is a Limp Take on the Tale washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Skip This Ball Cinderella Is a Limp Take on the Tale Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 16 2004 Stories can last forever if they achieve structural emotional and moral perfection and therefore can survive any telling of them. Such is true of ""A Christmas Carol"" or ""Sleeping Beauty"" or ""Snow White."" I thought it was true also of ""Cinderella"" until ""A Cinderella Story"" proved me wrong. You can say of this movie truly that they took the most famous tale in the world and broke it. The idea isnt without merit. The classic Charles Perrault story which probably dates from China has been moved from 17th-century Mitteleuropa to the San Fernando Valley. Hmm I hadnt noticed it but possibly theres a shortage of movies set in the San Fernando Valley. Generally the production suffers from -- in addition to bad performances witlessness general ugliness of execution and an energy level comparable to that of lima beans sprouting -- a particularly annoying lack of cleverness. You really want to see the filmmakers live up to their obligation to find smart modern correlations to the classic devices of the story and they run out of cleverness long before they run out of movie. Whats the money moment in the story sure to goose a tear of joy out of even the most jaded old duffer? Why everybody knows its that moment where Ellas foot slides into the glass slipper and in that single second we know that moral order has been restored to the universe virtue has been rewarded love has been vouchsafed and Cinders ever-afters are going to be happy happy happy real soon. This of course is the moment the filmmakers chose to excise. Cinderella is played by child star-turned-pop singer Hilary Duff who isnt the problem. The movie is the problem. Duff is the solution but the movie never got that. As screenwriter Leigh Dunlap has worked it out -- this is so lame -- the sense of the privileges of royalty is expressed in SoCal terms by either high school social rank or suburban small business proprietorship. Duffs Sam is exiled to the far nether regions of the nothing-class by virtue of being compelled to work in her wicked stepmothers diner and is constantly humiliated by her classmates as a diner girl. ""Diner Girl"" they chant as if anyone in an American high school has ever been called a ""Diner Girl."" ""Loozer"" ""Nerdette"" ""Dweeb"" ""Twerp"" and even ""Silly Goose"" but not ""Diner Girl."" But the larger conceit is equally absurd of course Duff is adorable in the most American of American ways and in any high school between Bangor and San Diego shed be the cute one whom everyone wanted to be with. Shed be what Lizzie McGuire dreams of being. The Prince is a lanky star quarterback named Austin (Chad Michael Murray) who secretly pines to attend ""Prince""ton (get it?) but whose bossy father has him set up for pigskin stardom at USC followed by the assumption of his royal responsibilities as king of the car wash hell inherit. (Kingdom Car wash Lord how expectations have shrunk.) The gimmick that Perrault or the Chinese never thought of is e-mail. Both kids yearn for the swanky New Jersey college and have met by handle in the Princeton chat room. Thus while Austin hangs out with the cool set (whom he secretly despises but lacks the guts to escape -- some prince) and Diner Girl hangs out with one standard-issue nerd named Carter (Dan Byrd) theyve secretly fallen in love via the anonymity of the Net. I suppose the thought was to make it credible that when they are at last revealed to each other their cyberspace connection will argue for long-term commitment. Or maybe director Mark Rosman just caught up with ""Youve Got Mail"" on HBO 7. At any rate crudely manipulating the story -- Fairy Godmother here is the manager of the Diner a cliche sassy you-go-gal African American played by irrepressible Regina King -- Rosman (a ""Lizzie McGuire"" vet) manages to deliver the two to a masked ball where they meet at a prearranged time and enjoy one enchanted evening. Then she must hasten off but instead of leaving behind the tiny slipper she leaves her cell phone. And I thought You know kind of cool if they can bring off some cell-phone version of the foot-in-slipper deal. But no. At this point the movie largely abandons the Cinderella ur-text and simply becomes a bad teen film about cruel cliques nasty Heathers and good-hearted but sexually unthreatening nerds. As I say Duff is certainly a game trouper and she and King are the two best things in the film. The wicked stepmother (Jennifer Coolidge) is an ethnic stereotype of the vulgar Lainie Kazan variety and unpleasant; the two stepsisters played purely for comedy are uninteresting; and the worst thing of all is Murrays prince. Some day another fairy tale argued your prince will come but this one counters If its this guy you wont even notice. A Cinderella Story (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mild language and innuendo.

Hilary Duff is a master of disguise in A Cinderalla Story. This girl clearly has a future in espionage. Warner Bros. Were asked to believe that students and teachers alike fail to pick up on the fact that the school-dance mystery chick disguised only by a modest eye-mask is the classs widely termed ""Diner Girl"" and object of ridicule played by Hilary Duff. What if it were Jack Black in the same garb? Would you still not get it people? ABOUT THE MOVIE A Cinderella Story  1/2 (out of four) Stars Hilary Duff Jennifer Coolidge Chad Michael Murray Regina King Dan Byrd Director Mark Rosman Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG (for mild language and innuendo) Opens Friday nationwide These snobs who run the school have come up with the ""Diner Girl"" tag because Duff slaves in an eatery though why her near-hunk of a father married Walking Botox before he died is another of many unanswered questions. Jennifer Coolidge plays the harridan of a stepmom who inherits the joint when dad dies in an earthquake. (Were not making this up.) Coolidge then forces Duff into menial jobs dashes her Princeton hopes and brings along a pair of skanky stepsisters (one of whom makes natural gas in the swimming pool a heartwarming touch thank you). Storys Prince Charming is a quarterback played by Chad Michael Murray and the actor looks to the ""Chad""-gene born. Hes sensitive when all of his friends are pigs (a genre requirement). And Duffs unpopular best male pal (Dan Byrd) is less a Greek than Dweeb Chorus (another genre requirement). How do teen comedies like this still get made after super-smarties such as Ghost World and Mean Girls?

Wouldnt you guard those shoes with your life leaving behind oh a business card or something instead? ""A Cinderella Story"" Mark Rosmans contemporary update of the fairy tale at least addresses this sticky situation. Here Sam (Hilary Duff) flees the senior prom and her high-school-equivalent Prince Charming (Chad Michael Murray) as curfew approaches leaving behind ... her cellphone which is exactly the sort of thing that teenagers tend to leave behind. (Check any Nordstrom ladies room and youll see what I mean. But a stray shoe especially a cute one? Never.) Otherwise Id certainly rather have spent the 97 minutes of ""A Cinderella Story"" shoe shopping as the movie brings nothing new to the well-known story. Sam a sweet-faced blonde from the San Fernando Valley is a high-school senior whose single father died many years ago. She lives with her nasty over-Botoxed stepmother (Jennifer Coolidge) and slapsticky synchronized-swimming-obsessed stepsisters (Madeline Zima Andrea Avery) and she dreams of leaving them all behind when she goes off to college. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""A Cinderella Story"" with Hilary Duff Chad Michael Murray Jennifer Coolidge Regina King Madeline Zima Andrea Avery. Directed by Mark Rosman from a screenplay by Leigh Dunlap.97 minutes. Rated PG for mild language and innuendo. Several theaters. In between studying and working at her stepmothers diner Sams been instant-messaging a presumed hottie not knowing that hes the schools star quarterback Austin Ames. A meeting is arranged at the prom via e-mail midnight approaches and ... well if the original Cinderella were more up-to-date technically this is probably how her story would have gone. But theres not enough wit here to justify the effort. Coolidge a potentially brilliant comedian (one of the funniest moments on film last year came in ""A Mighty Wind"" when she just hums in an unclassifiable accent) has nothing to do but flounce around in too-tight costumes saying mean things to Sam. Leigh Dunlaps generic screenplay features lines like ""Youre not very pretty and not very bright"" that even Coolidge cant make sing. Duff is cute and chirpy; Murray is cute and bland and the stepsisters squabble a lot. Ho-hum. The grade-school girls who make up Duffs fan base may well be happy with this film; its age-appropriate for preteens and is full of sweet-natured talk about believing in yourself. The rest of us will think longingly of ""Mean Girls"" ""Clueless"" and other more intelligent teen fare. And well wonder about the nature of a Valley Girl fairy tale. Sam were told is miserably treated and forced to live in an attic room -- and yet she still has her own convertible. (This is all part of the bad treatment apparently because the convertible is kind of shabby.) Little girls and their budget-conscious parents should watch at their peril.

(AP Warner Bros. Pictures / Ron Batzdorff) Photo RON BATZDORFF The original Cinderella should have had it so easy 1 / 1 Back to Gallery A Cinderella Story Teen romantic comedy. Starring Hilary Duff Chad Michael Murray Jennifer Coolidge Regina King. Directed by Mark Rosman. Written by Leigh Dunlap. PG. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""A Cinderella Story"" is a generic high school romantic comedy and vehicle for 16-year-old superstar Hilary Duff who obviously had hair and wardrobe approval. Its not a terrible movie just a disappointingly pleasant one. Every Cinderella story needs unpleasantness to lend enchantment to the downtrodden lass eventual metamorphosis. But this reimagined fairy tale written by Leigh Dunlap and directed by Mark Rosman mutes its conflicts. The popular kids at school are as heinous as the girls step-family which is to say not very. The movie also diminishes its Cinderellas romantic possibilities. Her Prince Charming (Chad Michael Murray) is a flawed boy incapable of sweeping a girl off her feet. ""Lizzie McGuire"" star and pop sensation Duff plays orphan Sam banished to the attic of the San Fernando Valley home of her shallow stepmother (Jennifer Coolidge) and forced to work at the family diner to pay for college at Princeton. The popular kids a crowd that includes Murrays football star Austin deride her as ""diner girl."" Only theres a problem with this setup. Sam is the prettiest girl at school prettier even than the cheerleader Austin dates. As she showed in the ""Lizzie Maguire"" television series and film Duff can project insecurity but in this film she alternates it with a self-confidence that fits her appearance but not her underdog character. In figure-flattering tops and expertly flat- ironed hair Sam is a swan without ever having been a duckling. When she dresses as Cinderella for the Halloween high school dance she looks like the same lovely girl in a very nice dress. Except shes wearing a mask about five inches of fabric that allows her to go unrecognized by her peers. She and her prince already engaged in an anonymous e-mail romance (Cinderella has a computer in her room) have agreed to meet at the dance. They share an intimate moment but when she leaves at midnight to get back to the diner he has no idea of the girls identity. She has left behind a cell phone but with the lock feature on so he cant track her down. Thats something glass slippers never had -- a lock feature. Sam and Austin see each other regularly at school and at the diner but she worries he will reject her if she unveils her identity. He never recognizes her despite her plaintive stares. Murray the teen heartthrob from televisions ""One Tree Hill"" pulls off this conceit. His BMOC reveals some sensitivity in his e-mail exchanges but hes also cocky enough to refer to himself in the third person as ""Austin Ames "" as if its a brand. Its almost plausible that he would overlook the possibility that this diner waitress is his Cinderella. But Murrays success in the role doesnt make the character any more compelling. Hes a namby-pamby prince blinded not by love but by the need to preserve his reputation. The wicked stepsisters (Andrea Avery and Madeline Zima) have been defanged. They are geeky wannabe synchronized swimmers easily dismissed by Sam the only cool kid in the house. But the least inspired character is the stepmother played by gifted comic actress Coolidge from ""Legally Blonde"" and ""A Mighty Wind."" Handicapped by her characters Botox obsession Coolidge has to maintain a stillness that doesnt suit her. She looks constrained and neither scary nor particularly funny. Coolidge works best in showdowns with Regina King as a diner waitress and Sams earthbound fairy godmother. Unafraid to challenge her boss the waitress seems to be daring her into a fistfight every time they meet. King is about a foot shorter than Coolidge but she looks like she could take her. Dan Byrd gives the movies best performance as Sams actor pal a beanpole given to daily costume changes. Byrd plays this young man as smart and confident the kind of guy who will grow up to be a real catch. Too bad there are no romantic sparks between the pals. Now THAT would have been a welcome twist on ""Cinderella."" -- Advisory This film contains innuendo.

"Updated Cinderella will please tweens its perfectly plain to see - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Updated Cinderella will please tweens its perfectly plain to see By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  July 16 2004 To say the new Hilary Duff movie ""A Cinderella Story"" is deeply proudly average shouldnt dissuade you from taking your daughters. I cant imagine anyone over 14 and not in full-on chaperone mode going to this high school revamp of the classic fairy tale on their own but the film by pleasantly predictably hitting the sweet spot for the tweener crowd hits a different sweet spot for parents. ""Mean Girls"" its not; a plastic butter knife has more edge. But sometimes its nice to know your kids wont cut their fingers.Narrated by Duff with that winsome passive-aggressive shrug she put to good use on the Disney Channels ""Lizzie McGuire"" ""Cinderella Story"" locates this princess in the San Fernando Valley gives her a kindly widower father (Whip Hubley) marries him off to a blowzy shrew named Fiona (Jennifer Coolidge) then brings on the 1994 Northridge earthquake to do the old boy in (he dies offscreen amid discreetly unconvincing rumbling).Cut to eight years later and Sam (Duff) is slaving away at the funky diner her father ran now a salmon-pink eyesore owned by Fiona. There are the requisite stepsisters one skinny and stupid (Madeline Zima) the other squat and mean (Andrea Avery). Unlike in the fairy tale (but much like Lizzie McGuire) Sam has a smart unthreatening proto-nerd best friend named Carter (Dan Byrd) and behind the diner counter a support group of waitresses led by Rhonda (Regina King) whos resourceful enough to serve as a fairy godmother in a pinch.And theres a prince -- you cant make a Hollywood movie for young girls without a bland attentive prince can you? (Well can you?) Here his name is Austin Ames and hes played by Chad Michael Murray who brought the puppy love in ""Freaky Friday"" and who is easy on the eyes and light on the hormones. The movie presents Austin as a football god and student president whos out of Sams league; in fact hes a poet who wants to attend Princeton in spite of his jock dads USC plans. Sam too wants to go to Princeton but stepmother Fiona plots to keep her close at hand.You read that right This is a movie where parents dont want their kids to go to one of the top colleges in the country.Heres more gritty realism for you Austin and Sam have met cute in an online chat room and are woozy from weeks of innocent instant-messaging passion but they know nothing about each other besides the fact they go to the same school. ""Nomad"" makes ""PrincetnGrl18"" promise to meet him on the floor of the big Halloween dance but theres a snafu when witchy Fiona makes Sam work the late shift at the diner . . .And so it goes with fairy-tale parallels that are sometimes amusing (coach = Carters dads Mercedes) and sometimes strained (glass slipper = Sams cellphone?). Because a modern tweener-girl movie also cant exist without a bitchy cheerleader and a soundtrack packed with sensitive uptempo diet-rock you get Austins mean-girl girlfriend Shelby (Julie Gonzalo) and a playlist of songs as close to the ""Freaky Friday"" and ""Lizzie McGuire Movie"" CDs as can reasonably be managed. (The Haylie and Hilary Duff version of the Go-Gos ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" gets prominent play.)The jokes are broad. The acting is broader. The movies take on IM romance is willfully naive (and why does the script keep calling it ""e-mail""?). But at least the movie explores the limits of the high school caste system goes easy on the rampant consumer fantasy and features a heroine whos not a stick. For all I know Hilary Duff snorts heroin with the Manson Family in real life but onscreen shes as close to real as Hollywood dares get a little chunky a tad awkward hopeful and hapless in equal measure. She cant act her way out of a sack and so what? For the 14 minutes Duff has left in her career the girls know shes one of them.

Hilary Duff will have target aud of tweener femmes lining up opening weekend. Perhaps having temporarily exhausted the supply of variations on classic princess stories Hollywood has gone back to the real thing in ""A Cinderella Story."" But modern footwear simply doesnt fit this perennial fairy tale heroine whos been reborn as a Valley Girl in a rendition that stumbles in almost every conceivable way as it attempts to deliver not only a hunky Prince Charming but some grrrrl empowerment along the way. Hilary Duff will have the target aud of tweener femmes lining up on opening weekend but limp storytelling and dud stabs at comedy should be apparent even to kids spelling less magical B.O. than a better film would have generated. Teaming up with her frequent ""Lizzie McGuire"" television director Mark Rosman in a bigscreener that looks distressingly TV-like in every respect the irrepressibly perky Duff who in ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"" last year seemed to be positioning herself to become the new Britney Spears here seems to be grooming herself as the next Reese Witherspoon. At least in terms of role modeling 16-year-old thesp is demonstrating improved taste and ambition. But thats about all that can be said in favor of this lusterless trifle which manages the almost unimaginable feat of making Jennifer Coolidge come off badly. Nearly every contempo teenpic cliche within PG range is on the menu put together by first-time scripter Leigh Dunlap with no specials provided to offset the blandness. ""The Valley is my kingdom"" proclaims Sam Montgomery (Duff) referring to the San Fernando Valley a domain of far greater wealth and population but vastly less charm than what Cinderella has heretofore been accustomed to. Brief prologue shows little Sam being suddenly deprived of her loving dad by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. For the several million people who experienced that event scene will seem a bit odd in that the temblor hits just when dad is putting his daughter to bed which would only figure if Sam turned in after 4 a.m. Just as unaccountable is the fact that this same good-looking dad had recently married an ungainly harridan named Fiona (Coolidge) who upon his demise redecorates his timelessly cool diner in ""Legally Blonde"" pink and makes a scullery maid of Sam both there and at home. Of course Fiona also has two frightful daughters of her own who keep Sam busy doing their homework and taking the blame for their nonsense. At school Sam hangs with the nerds specifically Carter (Dan Byrd) a late-bloomer with a theatrical penchant for dressing in extreme costumes. Derided by the Mean Girls as ""Diner Girl"" Sam is also involved in a confessional and flirtatious email correspondence with a mysterious fellow named Nomad who claims to be a misunderstood poetic soul but who is actually the schools hunky football star heartthrob and fellow Princeton applicant Austin Ames (Chad Michael Murray).Script is dominated by malicious banter that falls woefully short of intended delicious cattiness. But this shortcoming is nothing compared to the filmmakers drastic misjudgment concerning how much suspension of disbelief the audience might be prepared to grant regarding Sam going unrecognized as the princess who charms the prince at the ball. Clad in an unused wedding dress and a simple white mask at the Halloween Dance Sam learns who Nomad is and begins getting physical with him when midnight artificially requires her exit. Even after this prolonged up-close exposure Austin cant deduce the identity of the girl whos captivated him and no one else gets it either. Entirely incredible situation makes the follow-up unraveling incredibly tedious as pic laboriously avenges every slight rights every wrong and sends the happy couple on its way to the Ivy League with every last little bow tied and neatly in place. Duffs fan base will be happy enough to watch her character doggedly overcome underdog status and finally deliver the comeuppance Fiona and her idiot sprigs richly deserve. Same crowd will be equally pleased with the extensive screen time of the severely good-looking Murray. But Coolidges many admirers will be distressed to see this distinctive comediennes deliberately abrasive act slip from sharp-edged caricature to bloated cartoon as she struts about as an over-the-top witch enamored of Botox and lyposuction. Visually the film is sorely in need of a degree of stylization and glamour provided neither by budget nor artistry. Soundtrack offers the usual mix of hyperactive underscoring and pop tunes.
