The characters arent the ones the filmmakers should be worried about.

The characters arent the ones the filmmakers should be worried about. Dysfunctional Friends In addition to being crowded and overlong the pic is thoroughly unpleasant Its hard to believe the characters -- philandering ad man Brett (Wesley Jonathan) witchy hair stylist Ebony (Reagan Gomez-Preston) porn director Gary (Jason Weaver) washed-up rapper Jamal (Hosea Chanchez) professional sports groupie Storm (Stacy Keibler) et al. -- were ever friends to begin with. Or that once they finish trading insults theyd ever talk again much less stick around for the sequel writer-helmer Corey Grant so obviously sets up. Although none of the actors is given a lot to work with ex-footballer Terrell Owens makes a credible feature debut and Persia White as struggling actress Trenyce delivers a marvelous solo scene talking on her cell.
