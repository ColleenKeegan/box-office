Luckily she adopts a shaggy mutt who helps her cultivate a new social circle composed of a gentle musician with a prison record (Matthews) a spinster librarian (Eva Marie Saint) and a sage backwoods eccentric (Cicely Tyson). Opals canine companion also inspires her to penetrate her distant dads exterior and seek info about her estranged mom. Despite our heroines annoyingly ingenuous demeanor the films ending which finds the gang united for a party is not as treacly as it might have been.

As with that wonderful 2003 family film which managed to be heartwarming yet tough-minded this movie never stoops to easy sentiment. Indeed this is a film that pulls so few punches that until its final moments viewers arent entirely sure whether the title character -- a shaggy big-eyed lug of a mutt -- even gets to stay in the picture. With its setting of a broken-down Florida town called Naomi its plot points of absconded mothers and drowned brothers and its cast of characters each bearing more than a trace of sadness in their souls ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" sounds like kind of a bummer on paper. And true to Kate DiCamillos original book Wayne Wangs movie never flinches from representing the pain and loneliness experienced by a 10-year-old whos new in town -- emotions that will resonate with adults who know grown-ups can feel that way too. Opal (AnnaSophia Robb) right watches as her dog patiently endures the attention of Sweetie Pie Thomas (Elle Fanning) in ""Because of Winn-Dixie."" (Suzanne Tenner -- Twentieth Century Fox) _____More in Movies_____  Because of Winn-Dixie Showtimes and Reviews  Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Oscars Coverage  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now India Opal (newcomer AnnaSophia Robb) has arrived just in time for summer vacation -- a disastrous time for making friends -- with her father an itinerant priest she calls the Preacher (Jeff Daniels). Its an indication of the distance between them that Opal refers to her father with a definite article; he routinely shuts her out when hes working on a sermon for example or when she wants to know more about her mother who abandoned the family when Opal was 3. Its in this friendless and isolated state that Opal meets Winn-Dixie a scruffy huggable dog that she names after the southern grocery chain when she finds him running amok among the produce at the chains local store. ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" chronicles the summer when Opal and Winn-Dixie cobble together a quirky community of friends a group that includes Miss Franny an elderly librarian (Eva Marie Saint) a nearly blind recluse (Cicely Tyson) named Gloria Dump and Otis the mysterious manager of the local pet shop. That last character is played by the rock singer Dave Matthews who like the rest of this accomplished cast delivers an entirely credible performance in a film whose mystical touches could have easily sent it down a goofier or at least less believable path. One of the movies most touching scenes wherein Otis quietly sings to his menagerie while they stand in rapt attention is just one example of a moment that while fantastical is executed with remarkable subtlety and understatement. (Matthewss music and a soundtrack that includes cuts from Norah Jones and Emmylou Harris reinforces the laid-back vibe of a film that never strains for its atmosphere of rootsy southernness.) Like the rest of ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" the sweetness of the pet shop serenade scene is shot through with sorrow a theme that is brought to the foreground when Opal is given a canister of the candies that were once produced in the town. As she hands them out to her father and her friends each tastes the particular moments of grief that have marked his or her life. The movie is marked by long passages in which characters tell their tales sequences that rather than coming off as too talky testify to the mesmerizing power of pure storytelling. If this all sounds a bit heavy for a family film the youngsters at a recent screening didnt seem bothered and certainly fans of DiCamillos book should be pleased with how Wang has faithfully preserved the novels clear-eyed depiction of both pain and joy. That fealty extends even to the movies climactic scene in which a well-earned celebration is marred by a rainstorm and the disappearance of the dog everyone has come to adore. ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is that rare youngsters movie in which the happy ending isnt handed to the protagonist -- or viewers -- as a predictable matter of course. Instead its hard-won making it that much more triumphant when it finally comes. Because of Winn-Dixie (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mature themes and brief mild profanity.

All ears and eyes Opal (AnnaSophia Robb) and her father have trouble fitting into a new town until they meet up with this lovable mutt. By Suzanne Tenner Twentieth Century Fox As is often the case with screen adaptations the book tells the story more movingly and effectively. But this adaptation aided by some inspired casting is close enough to the original work to please most fans and its sufficiently entertaining for those unfamiliar with Kate DiCamillos story. (Related item See the trailer) Opal a lonely 10-year-old (AnnaSophia Robb) moves to a small town -- cleverly depicted in a timeless almost magical realist style -- with her preacher father (Jeff Daniels). Their relationship is strained by his reticence to discuss Opals mother who deserted her husband and child years before. By chance Opal meets up with an endearing stray mutt in the towns grocery store. She convinces her father that they must adopt the dog whom she names Winn-Dixie after the store. About the movie Because of Winn-Dixie    (out of four) Stars Jeff Daniels AnnaSophia Robb Cicely Tyson Dave Matthews Eva Marie Saint Director Wayne Wang Distributor 20th Century Fox Rated PG for thematic elements and brief mild language Opens Friday nationwide The grief of both father and daughter is eased by the presence of the grinning shaggy dog. He also seems to loosen the preachers inhibitions as he begins to tell Opal about her mother. She left because she couldnt bear the constraints of being a preachers wife. She also was an alcoholic. What seemed to be a simple story of a girl and her dog becomes a much deeper tale about loss and companionship. But the movie doesnt moralize or dwell too long in serious emotional terrain. Rather like a wise parent it dishes out just about as much as a youthful audience can handle. Little AnnaSophia is perfectly cast in the role. Her naivete and innocence seem authentic. With the irresistible pooch she befriends some of the towns outcasts and eccentrics. They all come together in a slightly corny -- but still appealing -- way forming a small community of their own. Eva Marie Saint does a fine job as the towns librarian who is far more cultured and well-read than the rest of the denizens and rocker Dave Matthews shows substantial acting talent as a guitar-plucking pet store clerk. But the movies best adult performance belongs to Cicely Tyson as a blind recluse who kicked her own alcohol habit and offers her wise counsel to the troubled Opal. She becomes a kind of surrogate maternal figure. Director Wayne Wang (The Joy Luck Club) mixes the darker themes and the folksy comedy with a light but not dismissive touch. However there is one stupidly slapstick moment involving the towns sheriff (Harland Williams) that should have been edited out. The fictional Florida town had a much happier past when it was the home of a thriving candy factory. Though it worked as a literary device the films emphasis on the leftover candies that ""taste like sadness"" feels a bit forced and undercuts the movies original quirky moments. Still Winn-Dixie is a welcome relief a whimsical family film about longing and belonging told with gentle humanity.

(Twentieth Century Fox/Suzanne Tenner) In this photo provided by Twentieth Century Fox Opal (AnnaSophia Robb) and Winn-Dixie prepare to transform a sad southern town in ""Because of Winn-Dixie."" (Twentieth Century Fox/Suzanne Tenner) Photo /SUZANNE TENNER To sad little girl rangy pooch is pick of the litter 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Because of Winn-Dixie Comedy/Drama. Starring AnnaSophia Robb Jeff Daniels Cicely Tyson Eva Marie Saint and Dave Matthews Directed by Wayne Wang. (PG 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) From the opening credits ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is about as subtle as a half-eaten bowl of Alpo left in the sun for a few days. The star of the show is introduced in a dog-wreaks-havoc-in-a-grocery-store bit straight out of ""The Brady Bunch"" playbook -- and the scene is repeated later in a trailer home and a church. But like the foul-smelling disobedient title character ""Winn-Dixie"" has a way of growing on you. And as the mongrel racks up about 250000 in property damage and potential lawsuit payouts even the most curmudgeonly dog- haters will probably be shedding a few tears. Based on the Kate DiCamillo novel and directed by San Franciscan Wayne Wang ""Winn-Dixie"" is about a dog named after a grocery chain its 10-year-old owner India Opal (AnnaSophia Robb) and life lessons in a small Florida town. As Opal confronts her preacher father (Jeff Daniels) about her missing mother Winn-Dixie helps her meet the towns well-cast collection of oddball characters including the recluse Gloria (Cicely Tyson) and a town librarian (Eva Marie Saint) who once used a Tolstoy novel to fend off a bear. Wang deserves credit for making a film about a preachers daughter in the most notorious red state and avoiding conservative religious undercurrents on one side and ""Footloose""-style conformity-bashing on the other. Theres talk of God in ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" but more talk of tolerance and you get the feeling that even the most spiritual characters would appreciate that controversial episode of ""Postcards From Buster."" The adult actors all make the extra effort to flesh out characters that dont get a lot of screen time and Daniels is particularly good. But the real surprise is musician Dave Matthews in his second movie role as a guitar- playing drifter who suddenly shows up behind the counter of the local pet store. Matthews holds his own with his experienced co-stars and his half- talking/half-singing explanation of his criminal past is the movies best scene. Wang has no luck with the rest of the cast. And since its karma suicide to savage a childs performance he must take the blame for the shortcomings of Robb. While shes more than sufficiently cute too many of her overly precocious lines are delivered as if theyre being read off cue cards -- especially in the voice-over narration. While the lead actress isnt exactly Tatum ONeal the lead canine is no Lassie either. For the first third of the movie its unclear what the dogs attraction is other than to move the plot forward. By the time Winn-Dixie bites a cop members of the audience may sympathize with the various factions who want the dog sent to the pound. But the mutt has a couple of surprises and so does this movie. There are a few small messes in ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" but its easy enough to look the other way. -- Advisory This movie contains some adult themes including alcoholism and child abandonment.

It has old-fashioned and heartwarming written all over it in heavy black Magic Marker.Adapted from Kate DiCamillos best-selling childrens novel this is the story of a girl a dog a single father and a circle of colorful supporting Southern characters. Opal Buloni (AnnaSophia Robb) is a very lonely 10-year-old since she and her father (Jeff Daniels) a preacher have moved to Naomi Fla. a town so small (or odd) that church services are held in a convenience store. So when Opal sees a scruffy dog loose in a Winn-Dixie supermarket one day knocking down bumbling adults and scattering fruit everywhere in movie-cliche fashion she claims the animal names him for the place where they met and takes him home to the trailer park.Once Opal has Winn-Dixie at her side she makes friends easily. They include the librarian (Eva Marie Saint) who tells a story about a bear stealing a copy of ""War and Peace""; Gloria Dump (Cicely Tyson) known as the Witch but really just a nice blind woman who lives alone; and Otis (Dave Matthews as in the Dave Matthews Band) a gentle young man with a guitar who gives Opal a job at Gertrudes Pet Store. Opal feels so empowered that she begins pressing her emotionally shut-down father to tell her more about her mother who ran away seven years ago.The dog that plays Winn-Dixie is cute enough so it seems believable that normally sullen churchgoers might be won over when he disrupts services during the hymn ""Just as I Am."" Opal explains ""He just dont know the words is all. But he sure is moved by the spirit.""Ms. Robb 11 is charming and ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is a harmless pleasant comic drama but elements that may have seemed delightfully eccentric on the page take on unfortunate new tones when translated to film. Naomi is the home for instance of the Litmus Lozenge Company now defunct which made candy in which sorrow was an actual ingredient. A taste leads Opal to observe ""how the sweet and the sad were all mixed up together."" In this movie so are the magic realism and the corn.""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity grown-up discussions about alcohol and the brief illusion of a dog eating a live mouse.

"Winn-Dixie Best in Show washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Winn-Dixie Best in Show Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 18 2005 OPAL (AnnaSophia Robb) wants someone to love. She just rolled into sleepy old Naomi Fla. with her preacher father (Jeff Daniels) and doesnt know a soul. Its not the life to make a lonely girl jump for joy. She lives in a trailer park with dad. She hasnt seen her mother since she was 3. Dad has to preach in makeshift Sunday gatherings at the local convenience store. And the other kids in town arent particularly welcoming including two buzz-headed brothers (Nick Price and Luke Benward) who taunt her all the time. In Wayne Wangs family-friendly charmer ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" Opals loneliness is turned around when she sees a fuzzball of a dog running amok in the local Winn-Dixie shopping store causing a catastrophe of spilled food and upended clerks. Realizing instantly that she has found her special companion she assures the manager she owns the wet-nosed pooch a Picardy shepherd and takes it home. If youre of a certain age or you rent from the classics shelves youve seen those charming old Disney fuzzers of yore with children falling in love with critters of every shape and size. Wangs movie follows that tradition (the storys based on the popular Kate DiCamillo book of the same name) but transforms it into a homespun celebration of eccentricity. Everyones got their own funny foibles and independent spirit. Dad has to promise his grumpy dog-hating landlord (B.J. Hopper) that hell look for someone to adopt Winn-Dixie. But no one has counted on Winn-Dixies ability to win everybody over even if he cant seem to avoid pulling down clotheslines and running into trouble. He almost literally drags Opal into new relationships. Thanks to him she meets Otis (singer Dave Matthews) a laconic but sweet-natured clerk at the local pet store who likes to play his guitar for the animals; genial librarian Miss Franny (Eva Marie Saint); and an eccentric lady (Cicely Tyson) who lives alone and has a glorious tree in her yard practically gift-wrapped with hanging bottles to scare ghosts away. Even those buzz-haired brothers change their tune. Wang who made ""Chan Is Missing"" ""Eat a Bowl of Tea"" and ""The Joy Luck Club"" has a sure touch when it comes to building worlds full of innocent charmers. But his real coup is in the casting. Matthews is a likable presence a subtly magical drifter who strums catchy tunes and knows how to talk back to a rude parrot. And most importantly Wang has found the perfect young leading lady. Robb (who will play Violet Beauregarde opposite Johnny Depp in the upcoming ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") is a puckery scamp who suggests a 10-year-old Keira Knightley. Shes also remarkably assured; there isnt a false note in her performance. And not only does she take full charge of the movie she manages to out-charm the Picardy. BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE (PG 100 minutes) -- Contains some mature themes such as alcoholism and mild obscenity. Area theaters.

Uneven though it is ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" based on Kate Di Camillos novel is tough to dislike. Yarn about a lonely girl a homeless dog and their healing effect on a disjointed Florida community features a gifted eclectic adult cast that helps overshadow its 10-year-old leads inexperience. Generally pleasing where it could have been sickly sweet pic will undoubtedly be marketed by Fox for its Feb. 18 opening as a contempo family classic a movie to which kids can take their grandparents. While theatrical bonanza seems a long shot film should enjoy a thriving ancillary life in DVD. Given ""Winn-Dixies"" appeal to the under-13 and over-60 sets helmer Wayne Wang seems an odd choice. Though Wang has previous experience with book-to-screen adaptations (""The Joy Luck Club"") his interests have never veered toward this sort of tyke-driven sentimentality. Wang has stated the characters in his movies share a common sense of longing -- a tenuous thread at best but one that does permeate this film. Left by her mother when she was a toddler for reasons unknown to her Opal (AnnaSophia Robb) aches for a fulfilling home life but her emotionally distant preacher dad (Jeff Daniels) is oblivious to her needs. When Opal discovers an abandoned mutt whom she names Winn-Dixie (after the local supermarket) the new friends embark on a summer of adventure as they discover others who share a similar need to connect. Meandering through their small Southern community Opal and Winn-Dixie begin to dismantle misconceptions They befriend Miss Franny (Eva Marie Saint) a librarian who regales them with stories of her childhood; Gloria Dump (Cicely Tyson) an eccentric recluse mistakenly thought to be a witch; and Otis (singer Dave Matthews) an oddball loner who manages the local pet shop and serenades the animals with his guitar. Back at home Opals dad advised by their landlord the dog must go sets about finding it a new owner. But hes also pleased to see his daughter so happy and as his crusty exterior starts to crack he begins to unlock his cache of painful private memories. Wang and scribe Joan Singleton cut back and forth to interweave the stories leading to a celebration that unites the characters for the first time. ""Winn Dixie"" is never quite as poignant as it means to be except when its not trying so hard a flaw mostly traceable to Robbs lack of depth. In the obligatory ""dont take my dog away"" scene (Animal Control arrives to scoop up Winn-Dixie) the lovely wide-eyed blonde doesnt genuinely convey the terror a girl would feel at watching such an event. Its good to see vets Tyson and Saint on the bigscreen again. Singer Matthews imbues Otis with a natural unaffected charm. Kudos to the production team including lenser Karl Walter Lindenlaub who bathes the locations in a warm Southern light; production designer Donald Graham Burt whose sets feel musty and real; and costume designer Hope Hanafin whose outfits elucidate and embellish characters. Music by Rachel Portman provides narrative force and nuance and thankfully avoids treacle. At 105 minutes pic feels a bit weighty for younger audiences.
