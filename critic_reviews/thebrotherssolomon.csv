Comments The Brothers Solomon Will Arnett and Will Forte star as toothily obnoxious brothers who resolve to make a baby with some unfortunate woman so their comatose father (Lee Majors) will be able to hold a grandchild in his arms before he expires. The story makes no sense and the two lead characters are repulsive but I must confess I laughed immoderately at this clever piece of junk written by Forte and directed by Bob Odenkirk the funny half of HBOs Mr. Show With Bob and David. In one scene Forte uses baby dolls to prepare Arnett for the rigors of diaper changing with a stroke of positive reinforcement when Arnett opens up the ""dirty"" diaper its filled with snack food. What--not funny? Well all right. With Kristen Wiig and Chi McBride. R 93 min. By J.R.

By Claudia Puig USA TODAY This weekend also sees the arrival of Ron Howards ode to the Apollo space program and the latest big-screen offering from the Saturday Night Live gang. In the Shadow of the Moon   1/2 (out of four) CLIP See a preview of In the Shadow of the Moon ASTRONAUTS RECALL Surviving Apollo crewmembers speak out One small documentary for a filmmaker and one giant leap in inspiration for audiences. Science and humanity are fused lyrically in this astonishing film which puts the Apollo space flights in historical and sociological context and features spectacular footage from 1969s Apollo 11 mission that captures the thrills and tension of mans first steps on the moon. But the most stirring moments are the recollections of 10 Apollo astronauts. Mike Collins less of a household name than his Apollo 11 mates Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong manned the spaceship while they walked on the moon. His comments are among the most poignant. He speaks of a sense of exaltation during the historic mission and says he faced life with greater equanimity after his return ""Maybe some of our terrestrial squabbles dont seem as important after going to the moon."" Alan Bean had a similar reaction. ""Since then Ive not complained about the weather or traffic jams."" The one glaring omission is Armstrong. We see him in footage hear his historic quote and someone notes that hes reclusive but the filmmakers should have added a note explaining his absence. One of the more moving sequences comes when astronaut Dave Scott talks about returning from the lunar landscape and marveling at the Earths abundant beauty ""It truly is an oasis and we dont take very good care of it."" (Rating PG for mild language brief violent images and incidental smoking. Running time One hour 40 minutes. Opens today in New York and Los Angeles.) -- The Brothers Solomon  CLIP Get a sneak peek at The Brothers Solomon Theres nothing very wise about The Brothers Solomon. Its a moderately funny premise in search of some real laughs. Two unnaturally close brothers played by Will Arnett and Saturday Night Lives Will Forte decide to have a child to satisfy the greatest desire of their comatose father (Lee Majors). Told by a doctor that people can rally when they have a specific event to live for these earnest loving lads jump through a series of occasionally humorous hoops to attempt to father a child. Theres a short but funny scene featuring The Offices Jenna Fischer and a flashback to their childhood on the North Pole thats silly but humorous. However several running gags grow less funny over time. SNL buddy Kristen Wiig so hilarious in Knocked Up is not given much to do here. Her job is to be the comic foil and its a thankless one. Ditto for Chi McBride who mostly serves to underscore the Solomon boys foolishness. Love interest Malin Ackerman is boringly one-note. She doesnt do much more than roll her eyes which is pretty much our reaction to many of the films segments. Though there are moments of inspired silliness they are insufficient to keep this from seeming like an overly long TV skit. As a segment on SNL this could have been quite funny and it might have had a future as a recurring bit. But stretched out over nearly 90 minutes the fun dissipates. Even the inevitable ""outlandish"" outtakes that roll during the credits are devoid of humor. (Rated R for language and sexual content. Running time One hour 31 minutes. Opens today nationwide.)

The Brothers Solomon Hair-raisingly unfunny | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Brothers Solomon Hair-raisingly unfunnyThis hair-raisingly unfunny movie makes Dumb and Dumber feel like George Bernard Shaw in retrospect.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Sept. 7 2007 (out of 4)Starring Will Arnett Will Forte Chi McBride Lee Majors. Written by Will Forte. Directed by Bob Odenkirk. 91 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued BelowThe chipper idiocy demonstrated by the brothers Solomon - John (Will Arnett) and Dean (Will Forte) - is attributed to the fact that they were home-schooled at the North and South Pole.This presumably accounts for their vast but sunny ineptitude when it comes to even the most basic of social functions.But it also raises questions as to which far-flung school the makers of this hair-raisingly unfunny movie - which makes Dumb and Dumber feel like George Bernard Shaw in retrospect - learned how to make comedy. Im guessing an ashram somewhere in Ukraine.Directed by Bob Odenkirk - the former co-star of Mr. Show who perpetrated last years equally hellacious Lets Go to Prison - The Brothers Solomon trolls the remnants left by Dumb and Dumber Knocked Up The 40 Year-Old Virgin and other recent comedies of white-guy queasiness to recount how these two cohabitating morons go about securing a grandchild in order to revive their enviably comatose father (played by largely supine Lee Majors).The solution involves artificial insemination and the bad news - for us anyway - is that this will inevitably involve a lot of attention paid to the Solomons sadly underutilized little johnsons. Neither Odenkirks limp direction nor SNL alumnus Will Fortes script - not nearly clever enough to get away with its questionable gags about matters sexual and racial - provides much by way of actual plot or comedy. So its largely left to the boys knack for blank moonpie facial expressions to carry the day. But oh the weight. No matter how often Odenkirk cuts to nostril-storming close-ups of Arnetts and Fortes smooth and untroubled mugs - which he does with what comes to be almost orthodontic determination - nothing can conceal the fact that the brothers arent the only ones with nothing going on between the ears other than the distant sound of sled dogs barking.

All rights reserved. ... more Photo Merrick Morton Review Humor of Brothers Solomon falls on barren ground 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Brothers Solomon Comedy. Will Arnett Will Forte Chi McBride and Kristen Wiig. Directed by Bob Odenkirk. (R. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its hard to hate a movie that tries so valiantly to resurrect the career of Lee Majors. But even that noble task ultimately fails in ""The Brothers Solomon"" with the former ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" star spending 95 percent of his screen time in a coma. The letdown is typical of the comedy which had a lot of promise but ultimately isnt very funny. Even if you dont like the film its easy to see how it got made. The script written by co-star and ""Saturday Night Live"" regular Will Forte - hes the guy who has played Bush in recent years - sounds pretty good on paper. Forte and Will Arnett are Dean and John brothers who were raised by their single father (Majors still looking bionic) in the Arctic Circle. They summered in the Antarctic got homeschooled doctorates and went to the prom with two elderly Eskimo women who lived 100 miles away. Dean and John move to a big city their dad falls ill the socially inept brothers decide they need to find a woman to impregnate and hilarity ensues. Except it doesnt. Both brothers can be extremely grating and none of the other characters in the movie are particularly likable either. As comedians Forte and Arnett both are better in smaller doses and cant pull off the annoying-but-still-likable guy that Will Ferrell has made a gajillion dollars playing for the past decade. The women in the movie including ""SNL"" player Kristen Wiig and future ""Watchmen"" co-star Malin Akerman dont have a single funny scene. Worse yet the events in the film are routinely depressing (dad in a coma failed date upon failed date the surrogate mother wants to keep the baby ...) the humor is often very foul and theres nobody to root for. During the moments - and they are plentiful - when the jokes fail the movie becomes especially difficult to watch. Forte and Arnett do way too much mugging for the camera as if both of their parts were written for Jim Carrey and he bailed at the last minute. Is there anything good about this film? Forte the sole screenwriter has a nice eye for detail and the jokes that do hit are ones you havent heard before. A scene where the brothers go to an adoption center is pretty hilarious as is the reason - told in flashback - that John and Dean ended up on the North Pole in the first place. But theres a good chance those two scenes will end up on YouTube someday. At best ""The Brothers Solomon"" is a rental where youll at least have the safety of a fast-forward button. If you really want to see Majors that badly check out old episodes of ""The Fall Guy."" Season 1 just came out on DVD and hes fully conscious in almost every episode. -- Advisory This film contains sexual content gross-out humor profanity and several versions of the song ""St. Elmos Fire (Man in Motion)"" which has aged considerably worse than Lee Majors.

At area theaters (131). R Language. Will Arnett and Will Forte may be talented comedians but you wont know it from Bob Odenkirks dumbed-down knockoff of ""Dumb amp; Dumber."" The two Wills play John and Dean roommate brothers whose home-schooled isolated arctic upbringing has left them incapable of scoring with women and carrying out their dying fathers last wish - to see a grandchild before he dies. After numerous botched computer dates they advertise on Craigslist for a surrogate mom and - for 12000 - hook a gamer named Janine (""Saturday Night Lives"" Kristen Wiig). Her 6-foot-5 janitor boyfriend (Chi McBride) isnt as keen on the deal as she is and physical harm threatens the Solomons through the third trimester. The upbeat brothers are full of sweetness and love but the script is made of taffy and if you can chew and laugh at the same time youre welcome to it. - Jack Mathews FIERCE PEOPLE 2 stars Drama of teenage boy living his jungle fantasy on a rich mans estate. At Regal Union Square and City Cinemas (151). R Language violence. Some novels defy movie adaptation. That is the moral of this pretentious class-conflict curio directed by Griffin Dunne and written by the books author Dirk Wittenborn. What might have read as a dense allegory comparing the rituals of the super-rich with the tribal customs of the violent Ishkanani tribe in the Amazon becomes a tedious over-ripe soap opera on screen. It stars Diane Lane as a drying-out New York masseuse who moves with her 15-year-old son (Anton Yelchin) onto the vast New Jersey estate of an admiring castrated tycoon (Donald Sutherland) whose feet are putty in her hands. While the tycoons family seems to welcome them deeper psychological and anthropological dynamics are at work. The last act promises some very dark and primitive acts - not that you should care. - Jack Mathews I WANT SOMEONE TO EAT CHEESE WITH 2 1/2 stars Comedy about a lonely actor pining for a job and a romance. At IFC Center (120). Not rated Language. Jeff Garlin Larry Davids overweight agent in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" makes his feature writing and directing debut with this extremely slight but very genial comedy about an overweight Second City comedian (Garlin natch) desperate to land the lead role in a remake of ""Marty"" and bring some romance into his life. Garlin like Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine in ""Marty"" is good company even when his out-of-control eating and self-loathing threaten to overwhelm him. Not much happens to Garlins James except possibly everything. He has a one-night stand with a gamy ice cream parlor clerk (Sarah Silverman) and meets a cute teacher (Bonnie Hunt) with the reputation of being a ""chubby chaser."" The ""Marty"" role goes to a skinny young pop star (Aaron Carter) but by the end there are glimmers of hope James will overcome his craving for convenience-store pastries and find that soul mate.- Jack Mathews IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON 3 stars Documentary about the astronauts behind the Apollo missions to the moon. At the Sunshine and Lincoln Square Imax (140). PG mild language brief violent images. We dont want to trample on anyones dreams but chances are pretty good that youre never going to walk on the moon. Thats okay though - director David Sington has assembled an astonishing collection of men who have and want nothing more than to share the experience with us all. Singtons style is straightforward blending firsthand accounts from astronauts like Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins with previously unseen footage from their missions between 1968 and 1972. And oh what stories these heroes have to tell - and what incredible sights they brought back with them. When one describes ""that jewel of Earth"" they witnessed from space we see what they did - and understand just a little the transcendent awe they say they felt. - Elizabeth Weitzman THE INNER LIFE OF MARTIN FROST 1 1/2 stars Romantic fantasy about a writer who falls for an enigmatic stranger. At the IFC Center (133). NR nudity sexuality mature themes. ""Inner life"" is right Paul Austers suffocating romance makes you feel as if youre helplessly stuck inside the head of the most pretentious person you know. In a stilted performance that hints at either boredom or embarrassment David Thewlis plays Martin Frost an aggressively anti-social writer who is either a genius or a self-deluded egomaniac. Claire (a melodramatic Irene Jacob) must think its the former since she mysteriously shows up at his vacation house one day with the intention of dedicating her very existence to his fulfillment. If thats her choice so be it. As for us we found little reason why anyone would spend an hour and a half with this guy let alone a lifetime. - Elizabeth Weitzman THE BUBBLE 3 stars An Israeli soldiers life changes when he dates a Palestinian man. At the Lincoln Plaza Angelika and Clearview Chelsea (157). NR nudity sexuality drugs violence. In Hebrew and Arabic with subtitles. Israeli director Eytan Fox specializes in blending the mundane with the extraordinary - an everyday dichotomy for the characters in his sensitive drama about life in Tel Aviv. During the week Noam (Ohad Knoller) works in a record store and parties with his roommates. On weekends he has to patrol a check point where he meets a Palestinian named Ashraf (Yousef Sweid). The two fall in love but in the Middle East it seems nothing is easy. Between politics and homophobia only drastic measures can keep them together. Fox stumbles a little at the end which is unnecessarily exaggerated. He should have trusted his own talent - its the attention to minor details that makes his work so memorable. - Elizabeth Weitzman CRUISING 2 1/2 stars Re-release of a 1980 thriller about an undercover cop trying to trap a serial killer in Greenwich Village. (142) R violence language sexuality. At Regal E-walk. In advance of its first-ever DVD release on Sept. 18 William Friedkins controversial 1980 thriller is getting a weeks theatrical re-release at the Regal E-walk. Thats the way to see it if you must because its gamy images inside the leather and Samp;M gay bars along the Greenwich Village waterfront are both busy and dark. Al Pacino stars as a young cop asked to go undercover to find and trap a serial killer whose victims are drawn out of those gay bars and punished for the killers guilty conscience. As he develops sources and friends in that milieu the cop begins to like the smell of leather himself stops making love to his girlfriend (Karen Allen) and develops an obsession with the man hes stalking (Richard Cox). Creepy in 1980 ""Cruising"" is almost macabre now knowing that most of the young men involved in rough unprotected sex then began dying of AIDS shortly afterwards. - Jack Mathews Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Brothers Solomon proves wise by borrowing from funny films - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review Brothers Solomon proves wise by borrowing from funny films Will Arnett (above) and Will Forte play celibate brothers raised in the Arctic who learn that their dad is ailing and decide to help by making him a grandfather. (Merrick Morton/Revolution Studios) By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent  |  September 7 2007 OK lets see if weve got the movie comedy timeline straight Not quite a decade ago the Farrelly brothers really break out. Over the last couple of years audiences finally find a new anything-goes brand in Judd Apatow director of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up."" (Heck even the Farrellys had grown restless with the same old same old and moved on to ""Fever Pitch."") So now the next logical development is to knock off Apatow . . . pod-shuffling his humor with the Farrellys ?Riding the recent wave in somewhat unlikely style sketch comedian/director Bob Odenkirk (""Mr. Show"" ""Lets Go to Prison"") and writer Will Forte (""Saturday Night Live"") essentially imagine its the ""Dumb and Dumber"" guys having the sex and baby issues. Will Arnett (""Arrested Development"") and Forte are John and Dean Solomon siblings and urban roomies whose home-schooled upbringing in the Arctic wastes somehow failed to educate them in the ways of women (""puppet-based sex education"" lessons notwithstanding). The boys were raised to have an indefatigable can-do attitude so they mostly just shrug off their forced celibacy with ""well get em next time"" optimism. Theyre Steve Carell minus the inhibitions and after-hours melancholy. But when they learn that dad Lee Majors is comatose and close to death they promptly fixate on having a baby as the one bit of miracle news that might keep the old man hanging on.The movie gets some good moments out of the various false starts that eventually lead the two to Janine (Kristen Wiig) a levelheaded but desperately broke woman kinda-sorta willing to rent them a womb despite the comically foul-mouthed protests of her estranged boyfriend (Chi McBride). And the brothers of course are just as blithely clueless about babies as they are about relationships setting up a few new variations on those requisite junior high health class exercises in caring for a doll without mangling it. Theres one joke in particular about putting a positive spin on scary-dirty diapers that gets stretched like an undersize onesie - yet Arnett and Forte get away with it hilariously.""Brothers Solomon"" easily tops what Odenkirk Arnett and McBride delivered with the stale ""Prison"" but this new goof might have been funnier still if the premise werent so derivative so just been there done that. Its also odd if fitting that a story all about ineptitude with girls actually handles them pretty tentatively itself. From the straightforward material Wiigs given here youd hardly know she was an ""SNL"" castmate of Fortes. And Malin Akerman (""The Comeback"") plays it mostly cool but then inexplicably warmer at points as the smokin chick next door who wants none of John. Ah women - cant get with em cant make a movie on the subject without em. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

After watching Katherine Heigl have all the fun in ""Knocked Up"" Kristen Wiig gives pregnancy a shot in ""The Brothers Solomon"" a forced split-the-baby comedy that proves unwise from its very conception. When titular sibs Will Arnett and Will Forte decide the only way to wake their father from an arbitrary coma is to give him the grandchild he always wanted they recruit Wiig in a lame-brained artificial-insemination scheme. If ""Hot Rod"" and ""The Ex"" couldnt attract an aud this full-blown comedy miscarriage stands no chance. Arnett and Forte play thirtysomething bachelors John and Dean Solomon two bone-headed brothers who are constantly deferring to one anothers ""better judgment."" Raised in the arctic by a single father (Lee Majors) the two socially awkward sibs are ill-equipped for modern dating their acts of intended chivalry grossly misinterpreted by the women they pursue. On a typical first date John proposes and Dean kisses his girlfriends father on the lips. When presented with a challenge the Solomon boys are capable of talking one another into the worst possible ideas. Its an intermittently amusing dynamic that eliminates any potential for conflict as the duo agree on even the most ludicrous solutions -- namely a plot to deliver a baby to make their father proud. The challenge of course comes in convincing perfect strangers to go along with their schemes. A check for 12000 is all it takes to persuade the opportunistic Janine (Wiig) to serve as their surrogate although the would-be mother located via Craigslist complicates things by bringing her antagonistic ex-boyfriend (Chi McBride) into the mix. While the two brothers debate who will do the honors of impregnating her John sets his sights on Tara the hottie across the hallway (rising starlet Malin Akerman who possesses model-beautiful looks but not much range) who exists solely to set up yet another joke that doesnt work. In director Bob Odenkirks eyes there would seem to be little distinction between a serious drama putting a character in a coma and giving Majors the same treatment for comedic purposes although most auds would vehemently disagree. Nothing so much as resembling genuine emotion occurs in ""The Brothers Solomon"" (Arnett and Forte specialize in fake tears and plastic grins) placing this comedy in a far different class from this summers earlier childbirth comedy ""Knocked Up."" The screenwriting credit goes to ""Saturday Night Lives"" Forte who repeats that shows frequent sin of crafting sketches that overstay their welcome. Auds must sit patiently by while run-on routines baby-step toward their obvious punchlines then fall flat as in a scene in which the brothers hire an aerial billboard to deliver a preposterously long message only to run out of room at the very end. Rare is the joke that catches us off-guard although there is one fresh gag in which the brothers practice changing diapers stuffed with the unlikeliest ingredients. Though neither actor is quite ready to play lead Arnett has mastered the ""most insensitive man in the world"" routine while Forte excels at a unique cross between stunted man-child and Igor-like half-wit. Here they are Wacky and Wackier in desperate need of a straight man to accentuate their brand of comedy. Despite its flaws pic cuts together as if it were the film Odenkirk set out to make. Cheeky music alternates between composer John Swiharts near-constant chorus of la-la-las and multiple variations on the ""St. Elmos Fire"" theme ""Man in Motion.""

These latest offspring a pair of socially quarantined home-schooled freres (SNLs Will Forte who wrote the script and Arnett doing a sweeter Gob Bluth) are not without their charms The sheer animal idiocy beaming from their faces in the opening credits of The Brothers Solomon creates the films only moment of uncalculated comic joy. Alas their quest -- giving their dying father the grandchild he always wanted -- feels like a cheapo soft-R retread of the dimwits progress from Dumb and Dumber with director Bob Odenkirk dropping Fortes jokes like anvils.
