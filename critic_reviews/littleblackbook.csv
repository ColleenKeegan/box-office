When TV junior Stacy (Murphy) discovers that her absent boyfriend Derek (Ron Livingston) keeps a picture of an ex on his Palm Pilot she interviews his significant exes under a pseudonym pretending its research for the chat show on which she works. The idea is to gain a greater understanding of Derek but Stacy learns a lot more than she bargains for about men relationships and working ethics in the television game. With Holly Hunter as an ambitious colleague and Kathy Bates as a self-important show host this flirts with sharp satire about broadcasting but too often diverts to failed farce as Stacy fumbles around her boyfriends apartment and life. This inhabits a strange middle ground between cynical comedy and sappy chick flick and while its preference for realism over romance may be laudable its unlikely to satisfy fans of either genre.

Just a glimpse of ex-lovers questioning paternity strippers on parade and betrayed friends entangled in fisticuffs is enough to give any discerning person pause about the state of American culture. So watching ""Little Black Book"" whose plot involves the unseemly elements of a trashy television talk show and not being able to turn it off each time it crosses the line of decency is slightly disturbing. Even more disturbing however is that the romantic comedy fails on most levels including its attempt to sufficiently poke fun of bad sleazy reality television. Brittany Murphy left and Holly Hunter do some snooping in ""Little Black Book."" (Zade Rosenthal -- Columbia Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  Black Book Showtimes and Details  Watch the Trailer  Summer Movie Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert Its not well scripted enough or well acted enough to do much of anything save make anyone watching really hate Brittany Murphy for being so annoying and so incredibly unlikely as a cute twenty-something Diane Sawyer wannabe. Its not even fully acted since Murphys character Stacy Holt basically narrates half of the movie. And when shes not stringing together cliches about life and love in her narration or trying to act like a girlfriend who is investigating past relationships of her boyfriend Derek (Ron Livingston) she steps her annoyance level up a notch by singing multiple renditions of Carly Simon songs. As an associate producer for the ""Kippie Kann Show"" hosted by Kippie Kann (Kathy Bates) Stacy discovers that Derek dated a former show guest. When Derek refuses to talk about his bulimic supermodel ex Stacy wonders why. Her co-worker Barb (Holly Hunter) encourages Stacy to delve into Dereks past by interviewing his previous girlfriends under the false pretense that they would be positively featured as successful career women on the talk show. While Derek is out of town on business Stacy searches the Palm Pilot -- the modern ""little black book"" -- he left behind to begin her quest. Stacys research apparently teaches her something about the Mr. Right she seeks but the point of the bigger picture is unclear. Just like a television talk show that follows a formula and dumbs itself down considerably the film resorts to the kind of humor that gets a reaction only because a sign tells viewers to laugh or make noise. Not much in the film would warrant even canned laughter especially when there are scenes like the one in which Stacy visits one of Dereks old girlfriends a gynecologist. Stacy thinks the woman is a podiatrist so she makes an appointment to check out her warts. Uncomfortable bathroom humor ensues as Stacy realizes her error and all of a sudden she is undergoing a thorough gynecological exam. Youd be hard-pressed to find anyone who really thinks watching a woman put her legs in stirrups while a doctor uses a metal device to do a checkup is funny. Unless of course they are the strippers prostitutes cheating spouses or countless others who allow themselves to be demeaned and promote ignorance on national television day in and day out. Without a lot of comedy or much romance ""Little Black Book"" is yet another episode you can afford to miss. LITTLE BLACK BOOK (PG-13 105 minutes) -- Contains sexual content and language and a fairly graphic scene involving a gynecological exam. Area theaters.

"Little Black Book Way Too Much Face Time washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Little Black Book Way Too Much Face Time Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 6 2004 In ""Little Black Book"" its hard to tell which is busier Brittany Murphys face or Melissa Carters plot. In the former the eyes are always rolling the nostrils flaring the lips puffing or shrinking smirking smiling frowning. Murphy works so hard to -- oof -- act you want to slip her a spare Prozac from the stash you brought to get you through the movie. Meanwhile in the story concocted by Carter Murphys character Stacy is using her status as an associate producer of a reality TV show as a cover to investigate her boyfriends old girlfriends while the reality show itself is veering wildly out of control heading toward either meltdown or cannibalism and Kathy Bates as star Kippie Kann seems to be threatening to explode on camera like someone in a David Cronenberg movie. But what you feel in ""Little Black Book"" more than anything is the conflict between the halves of the story the mooky sappy sentimental one about a young woman trying to find twue love and the black scabrous one about reality TV feeding on human misery for commercial gain. Of the two the second is at least interesting for a little while. The director Nick Hurran must have worked in TV for a long time as the best thing in the picture is his evocation of the competitive animosity among a young ambitious staff to provide the cynical crew of execs with scoops smashes astonishments and higher ratings. Think Sally Jessy Raphael or Ricki Lake ""The Kippie Kann Show"" features the routine betrayal and debasement of lower-caste fools who never figure it out until its too late and the dirty laundry basket of their sordid lives has been dumped on the floor for the edification of a national audience. At least no straight guys ever murder gay guys. Yet the film never really pauses to suggest this is er disgusting; in fact it rather enjoys the professional sadism that underlies the whole thing and watches with approval as senior producer Barb (excellent Holly Hunter) mentors Stacy into wrecking lives for fun and profit. Meanwhile Stacy in off-hours has found boyfriend Dereks Little Black Book which of course is now a Little Black Palm Pilot and is looking up his ex-girlfriends getting to know them (while pretending to be a TV producer) to try to figure out why he was more committed to them than he seems to be to her. One it turns out is a glam Euro-model another an egotistical doctor but the third a chef (Julianne Nicholson) is a woman that Stacy admires. You might wonder why this guy Derek did so well in the woman department as all seem several leagues above conventionally handsome emotionally uncompelling Ron Livingston who plays him. As you expect both plots converge in an orgy of recrimination bathos and unbelievability on daytime TV. If you cant see the big twist coming you should swear never to see another movie. If youre moved by Murphys boo-hooing you should swear to see a shrink and get a life. If you think its worth it to sit there for 97 minutes for three or possibly four laughs then you are beyond help. Little Black Book (97 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual innuendo and hockey.

(All guys have one of those boxes packed away right? Next to another box marked ""Impersonal Corporate Stuff""?). In Nick Hurrans romantic comedy ""Little Black Book"" Stacy (Brittany Murphy) who spends much of the movie proving that shes not exactly playing with a full deck does not heed this warning and dives right into her boyfriend Dereks secret box -- and boy does she regret it. And so do we. Despite the always-crisp presence of Holly Hunter (so elaborately tressed here that you wonder if shes seeking work as a shampoo spokeswoman) and some snappy supporting performances ""Little Black Book"" is a dud mostly serving to remind us of the other better movies that it wants to be when it grows up. Like ""My Best Friends Wedding"" its centered on an adorable heroine who engages in a nefarious scheme to try to get her man (Ron Livingston a chemistry-free match with Murphy). Like ""Broadcast News"" it features Hunter as a rat-a-tat television producer (here for a daytime talk show whose hostess played by Kathy Bates is a sort of senior Ricki Lake). Movie review Showtimes 1/2 ""Little Black Book"" with Brittany Murphy Holly Hunter Ron Livingston Kathy Bates Julianne Nicholson Stephen Tobolowsky. Directed by Nick Hurran from a screenplay by Melissa Carter and Elisa Bell. 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content/humor and language. Several theaters. And like ""Working Girl"" its the story of a baby-voiced young woman from Jersey who dreams of reaching the stars accompanied by Carly Simon anthems. Just in case you dont get the ""Working Girl"" connection (""Let the River Run"" did the job for me but Hurran and the screenwriters arent into subtlety) its pounded home with a thousand hammers -- such as a massive ""Working Girl"" poster that Stacy displays at her desk. (She calls it ""vintage."") Murphy whos done good work in ""Clueless"" and ""8 Mile"" seems to be aiming for a screwball Melanie Griffith-ish performance here but it misfires; alternating between googly-eyed dopiness and an oddly focused earnestness like shes trying very hard to remember something. (Maybe the phone number of the agent who put her in this movie?) By its endless third act as Stacy becomes a quavery emotional mess ""Little Black Book"" seems to self-destruct with only the Carly Simon tunes remaining. Clouds in my coffee indeed.

Starring Brittany Murphy Holly Hunter Ron Livingston Kathy Bates. Directed by Nick Hurran. Written by Melissa Carter and Elisa Bell. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There was a time when Brittany Murphy conserved her best assets. She would withhold her puppy-dog expressions and winning exuberance until the moment of maximum possible effect. But in the past few years as her films have gotten progressively worse Murphy has compensated by abusing her charms. Her eyes face and rail-thin body are always on high beam radiating a manic energy. Lets hope ""Little Black Book"" an awkward and aggressively unfunny film will end an unfortunate period for Murphy a true talent undermined by efforts to package her as the new Meg Ryan. Murphy seems to have made ""Little Black Book"" without a net. Director Nick Hurran plops the actress into ridiculous situations and lets her ebullience go unchecked. A scene of the tiny Murphy being pulled down the street by a large dog is so cheap it almost seems abusive. In another disconcerting scene Murphy lies on the floor and sings as if shes auditioning for ""American Idol"" complete with elongated notes. Shes not playing a singer but an aspiring TV journalist so the moment exists for vanitys sake to show off the actress pipes. Murphy has the disadvantage of being paired with fellow sprite Holly Hunter who has about 5 pounds and 20 years of experience on the young actress. Consider an atrocious sequence in which Murphys character Stacy and her co- worker Barb played by Hunter take elaborate measures to learn about Stacys boyfriends (Ron Livingston) former flames. The women celebrate their deceptive destructive acts by dancing to the arrhythmic Carly Simon song ""Let the River Run."" Murphy looks lost but Hunter commits to the ridiculous moment as if impromptu interpretive dance were just part of her characters eccentricity. She courts self-parody by playing an intense woman working in TV production a la ""Broadcast News"" but comes out intact hinting that Barb might be a bit unhinged. It might be billed as a romantic comedy but ""Black Book"" is really an office comedy on the level of a bad sitcom. Stacy and Barb work for a ""Jerry Springer""-style talk show whose host is played by Kathy Bates (in her ""Primary Colors"" assertive mode). An agonizingly lame running joke plays on the alliteration of Bates characters name Kippie Kam. But you can see what the filmmakers were going for since alliteration jokes are usually such surefire laugh-getters. During brainstorming sessions for the show Stacy Barb and co-workers dream of having slutty grandmothers appear as guests. How very outrageous and how very 1995. It makes you wonder how long this script written by Melissa Carter and Elisa Bell sat around before the movie finally got made. A more modern twist is the vessel through which Stacy snoops into the boyfriends past a Palm handheld. We know its a Palm and not a BlackBerry because the name is repeated a hundred times in a bit of product placement the Palm folks might regret when they see the picture. The device mistakenly left at home by the traveling hockey-scout boyfriend holds keys to his previous relationships like phone numbers and photos of old girlfriends. Stacy tracks down the girlfriends and grills them under false pretenses. Her behavior might be appalling if the boyfriend character were better drawn. Livingston is barely onscreen and when he is hes jokey and slightly removed just as he was as Berger on ""Sex and the City."" With so little to go on its easy to think of the guy as Berger and therefore unlikable. This approach offers a psychological balm for Murphy fans. Her character seems less creepy and her career choices by extension less depressing. -- Advisory This film contains profanity and sexual references.

Talk show producer Brittany Murphy uses her job to interview boyfriend Ron Livingstons exes in Little Black Book. Columbia Pictures Too bad this movie didnt. Theres plenty of muck to stumble through however in this silly farce starring Murphy as an ambitious TV producer. Her personal philosophy is shaped by the songs of Carly Simon and Simon fans will recognize many of their favorite hits on the soundtrack. The movies worst moments are when Murphy bursts into song (always a Simon tune of course) and when she jumps up and down in a show of annoying exuberance. ABOUT THE MOVIE Little Black Book   (out of four) Stars Stars Brittany Murphy Holly Hunter Kathy Bates Ron Livingston Director Nick Hurran Distributor Revolution Studios Rating PG-13 for sexual content/humor language Opens Friday nationwide But there are some funny lines and situations and Murphy makes the most of them a substantial improvement over her last attempt at comedy the dreadful Uptown Girl. But Little Black Book cant resist big cliches. Murphy and Hunter engage in the standard-issue musical montage. Hunter is far too talented to waste her time with such mediocre material as is co-star Kathy Bates who plays Kippie Kann an overbearing talk-show host. Murphy is associate producer for Kippies show and that comes in handy after she decides to delve into the black book (or Little Palm Pilot) of her pleasant but not terribly forthcoming boyfriend (Ron Livingston). She uses her job position to interview his former girlfriends. She discovers -- oops -- some things she wishes she hadnt. The movies shocking revelation Snooping can come back to bite you. Fortunately theres a bit more to it thanks to a little twist ending thats mildly entertaining. All in all this Little Black Book is textbook chick flick.

But heres what Ive learned about them from Little Black Book Theyre apparently needy developmentally delayed pollywogs with mental and emotional deficiencies that would seem to rule out employment anywhere except a very tolerant taco shack. But ""Little""s heroine Stacy (Brittany Murphy) has a dandy little gig as an associate producer for the Springer-like ""Kippie Kann Show"" (Kathy Bates plays the titular host). Not that you ever see her working. Oh no. That wouldnt leave much time for dancing around in her underwear concocting giggly stratagems revolving around Derek her studly dud of a boyfriend (Ron Livingston). Sure Ive just described every lazily conceived chick flick ever released. But ""Little Black Book"" is so much more. Were supposed to think so because Stacy talks incessantly about how much she loves ""Working Girl"" and its bard Carly Simon. She caterwauls ""Nobody Does It Better"" in the ladies room to get her head together. Shes part of a grand film tradition were made to understand - the latest in a long line of whimsical workplace warriors one bravely facing a new challenge making sure her man really really wuuuvs her. To that end she taps her work resources (and her beaus PDA) to track down darling Dereks exes with whom he may or may not maintain secret ties. Stacy had a father who split you see. Shes terrified of abandonment. Shes being egged on by her office pal Barb (Holly Hunter) whom we know to be eccentric because she shoves other peoples vibrating phones down her pants for a quick thrill. (Dontcha just love when your friends do craaazy things like that?) Given all of that Tess McGill surely wouldve indulged in similarly dopey antics. If she hadnt been so busy yknow working. ""Little"" isnt a comedy per se. It practically throws out its back with wackiness but underneath it nurses a misbegotten morality play. Stacy is essentially put on trial on TV in a Network-ish wig-out thats screechingly off-key. Theres a clumsy attempt to equate reality TV (exemplified rather nostalgically by talk-show brawls) with Stacys prying but the big climax isnt climactic just hysterical and incoherent. Murphy with her bug-eyed love-me mugging is simply too slight and gawky to play the Everygirl. Me? Ill take an Everywoman thanks complete with shoulder pads and leonine 80s mane. Because if this realm of dippy neurotic entitlement is the working girls new Jerusalem God help us.

Cut-rate pic registers as the least of Hollywoods recent spate of empowerment-themed chick flicks. This schizophrenic relationship pic-cum-showbiz satire has neither fresh ideas nor an entertaining way of presenting the recycled ones. Even its Carly Simon-obsessed protag wouldnt be so vain as to think that ""Little Black Book"" will be a hit. A cut-rate hybrid of ""Broadcast News"" and ""Working Girl"" pic registers as the least of Hollywoods recent spate of empowerment-themed chick flicks. This schizophrenic relationship pic-cum-showbiz satire has neither fresh ideas nor an entertaining way of presenting the recycled ones. Ever since she was a little girl Stacy Holt (Brittany Murphy) has dreamed of making a name for herself in the world of serious television journalism just like her idol Diane Sawyer. In the meantime Stacy must endure an associate producers gig on a bottom-feeding daytime talkshow. Host Kippie Kann (Kathy Bates) is on her way out and the typical topic is something on the order of ""Grandmas a hooker so handle it."" Stacys admiration for Sawyer is rivaled only by her fondness for the music of Carly Simon. These two paths converged in ""Working Girl"" the 1988 pic directed by Sawyers husband Mike Nichols for which Simon composed original songs. A poster of the film prominently adorns Stacys office cubicle. As ""Little Black Book"" opens Stacy is in a relationship with Derek (Ron Livingston) a recruiter for the New Jersey Devils hockey team and a seemingly decent guy about whom she knows little. When Derek heads out of town on business Stacy cant resist snooping through his Palm Pilot (mankinds modern-day equivalent of the pics eponymous object) which Derek conveniently has left behind. She discovers pictures and phone numbers of a slew of glamorous ex-girlfriends and it appears Derek is still in regular contact with several of them. Advised by her sassy conniving colleague Barb (Holly Hunter) to ""look under the hood before you purchase the car"" Stacy decides to research Derek by interviewing three of his former flames -- a supermodel (Josie Maran) a celebrity gynecologist (Rashida Jones) and an up-and-coming chef (Julianne Nicholson) -- under the pretense that theyre being considered as guests for Kippies show. Just watching ""Little Black Book"" wind its way through this setup is exhausting -- pic has been maddeningly overplotted by scripters Melissa Carter and Elisa Bell. Storyline concerning average-looking Derek as a sort of latter-day Casanova and Stacys revenge scheme is repeatedly dropped to focus on her efforts to advance herself in the workplace. And what a workplace it is Like ""Broadcast News"" ""Little Black Book"" wants to suggest the seat-of-your-pants carnival-like atmosphere of a live TV program but every note it strikes is false (even though pics director Nick Hurran is himself a TV vet). When the movie attempts to show us how crazy TV is -- as when Bates in what must rank as one of the most shameful moments ever suffered by an Oscar winner gets knocked over a coffee table by an overexcited midget -- it feels like the filmmakers havent watched TV since ""Donahue."" And when the pic builds to its rabble-rousing climax in which were supposed to be morally outraged by the extent to which Kippies staff will go to get the story Hunters presence serves only to underline how much more effectively this was portrayed by James L. Brooks two decades ago. There is only one moment of pure unadulterated joy in ""Little Black Book"" Murphy and Hunter spontaneously breaking into song to ""Let the River Run"" Simons rousing Oscar-winning anthem from the ""Working Girl"" soundtrack. The rest of the time the capable Murphy bats her big droopy eyes into a downright furor trying unsuccessfully to unite the films disparate threads. While his character reps the pics chief antagonist Livingston disappears for most of the movie popping up again in time for the finale. Only Hunters part has any real meat on its bones; starting out as a comical sidekick she deepens the role into something more complex. Tech package is uninspired with pics design elements doing little to disguise the fact that though set in New York and New Jersey pic was in fact shot on location in and around Los Angeles.
