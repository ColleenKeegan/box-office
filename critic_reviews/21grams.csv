"The Missing Opies Western opus. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Missing Opies Western opus. The Missing Opies Western opus. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 26 2003 630 PM Childs Play Kids in peril in 21 Grams and The Missing. By David Edelstein A few years ago after a spate of movies in which children died so that their parents could evolve as human beings (or else turn into bloodthirsty avengers) I decided it was time to take a stand. If youre going to kill children in a movie I thundered youd better have something profound to say about the human condition because it doesnt take insight or artistry to shake up an audience with dead kids. It just takes a certain kind of ruthlessness. Well it seems more thundering is in order because dead children are splattered all over our screens this holiday season. Ill give a pass to Jim Sheridans In America which is a scrupulous examination of a familys grief and in which the little boy in question expires before the film begins. But 21 Grams and The Missing use the deaths of children to add spurious moral weight to scenarios that are respectively trite and barbaric. Going to Penns state Advertisement Having butchered grown-ups and dogs in his debut feature Amores Perros the Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu now turns his attention to little girls whose senseless deaths (along with that of their father) form the centerpiece of 21 Grams (Focus Features). A grueling character study with a pretzeled syntax its supposed to make you ponder the question of predestination. Are our fates ordained? You might think so from the first 15 minutes which--like the auto accident that begins Amores Perros--offer a glimpse of three disparate people thrown together under bloody agonized circumstances. They are Sean Penn as some sort of mathematician with a fatally diseased ticker Benicio Del Toro as a born-again ex-con and Naomi Watts as the ex- and future-drug-addict mom of two run-over kids. From the opening we know that Penn will be sleeping with a bedraggled Watts and that he and Del Toro will have some sort of face-off that leaves them both covered in blood. But how will their fates become linked? The movie leaps backward then forward then sideways then does a back-flip then executes a handstand followed by a half-twist double-gainer. The Russian-judge film critics have been impressed but I found myself hopelessly confused Penn goes under the knife twice Del Toro is in prison twice and Watts goes for long swims before and after her children die. Is the strategy to make you work so hard to determine where you are in the timeline that you overlook what a dreary and conventional little soap opera this is? Inarritu keeps returning to the dad and his two little girls as they hurry down the sidewalk toward their fate circling closer and closer to the horrifying moment--an art-house sickos striptease. The director has been acclaimed for the films ""startling"" intimacy which looks to me like sticking his camera in the faces of his great actors and commanding them to suffer. They do with all their hearts; but the only performance that caught me off guard was by Melissa Leo as the wife and mother who rides to the scene of the accident to view her husbands hit-and-run handiwork and who argues furiously that to turn himself in would be to injure his own family (a wrong but recognizably human position). Watts was so good in David Lynchs Mulholland Drive (2001) that you never caught her acting even when the performance changed gears and she pulled the rug out from under you; consequently she was overlooked for major awards. This time she wont be but the performance--brave as it is--has a fraction of the wit and imagination of the one that made her a star. Del Toro uses his bearish physique and echo-chamber voice to create a man with so many layers--so many inner checks and balances--that his tragic disorientation is entirely credible. But you dont really like or understand him. Penn has to behave like an idiot He follows the grieving Watts around and sweetly woos her all the while sitting on a ticking time-bomb of a secret. As usual with Penn I dont completely buy the character but I completely buy that he has brilliantly internalized something. He goes to some weird psychological places our Sean. Dr. Blanchett medicine woman Advertisement 21 Grams is worthy of contempt; The Missing (Columbia Pictures) is fathoms beneath it. Directed by Ron Howard its a schlock melodrama dolled up in arty frontier vestments. Salvatore Totino is the cinematographer and his wintry deep-focus vistas are some are the starkest Ive ever seen but for all its gravitas the movie is as cheaply plotted as any Grade C 40s Western serial. No thats unfair to those serials which didnt resort to shots of a dying baby--and then its corpse--to get you drooling for the bad guys blood. Cate Blanchett plays a depressed frontier doctor who brings the same relish to her carnal relations with ranch-hand Aaron Eckhart that she does to pulling the lone diseased tooth from an old Indian woman. Evan Rachel Wood plays her headstrong older daughter who wants to do the 1885 equivalent of shopping on Melrose Avenue go to the county fair to hear her voice coming out of one of those newfangled gramophone thingies like they have in Cleveland. On her way some very nasty Indians kidnap her to sell to Mexicans and leave Eckhart roasting over an open fire. (Scalped on camera in Nurse Betty [2000] Eckhart now qualifies as modern cinemas unluckiest paleface.) Fortunately Blanchett turns out to be half Apache (which explains those Asian princess eyes and cheekbones) and her dad  (Tommy Lee Jones) just happens to have wandered into her life--after an absence of decades--the day before. Although she loathes him she enlists his aid in a Searchers-style quest for the not-yet-deflowered virgin. She also lets her 10-year-old girl come along because well youre never too young to be exposed to sadistic homicidal white-slavers. Ron Howard works very hard to prove that he has left Opie behind but I think he should have listened to Sheriff Andy and steered clear of guns. The battle scenes are muscular bloody and totally incoherent. The rest of The Missing is shot like a high-toned monster movie and features a horrifying witch doctor (aka ""brujo"") who looks like Osama Bin Laden splashed with acid. This being a big studio production the film is careful to balance the evil-alien-psycho-demon Indians with decent-enough-to-smoke-a-pipe-with Indians. The only thing even remotely interesting in The Missing is Jones performance which is a perfect blend of integrity insolence and insanity. What is he doing? The character has had himself a lot of women but never stuck around to raise the kids--now hes trying to make amends. A whorish actor would have really played up the grief over all those lost years of bonding with his kids and given us a remorseful tortured soul. But Jones must have decided that asshole he has been and an asshole he will be. He knocks out all the low notes in his voice and sounds like Bill Clinton at his most dodgy and gazes at his daughter with the sad eyes of a man who just cant be bothered to emote. Jones doesnt rise above the material but he doesnt sink with it either. Given all these butchered children I envy the man his indifference. Correction Dec. 1 2003Thanks to those readers whove corrected me In The Missing Tommy Lee Jones is not an Apache he merely lives with and like the Apaches. He is a Dances With Wolves kind of Apache. This is a peculiar thread in the film since his daughter (Cate Blanchett) copes with his presence as a reminder of a hidden shame and since Jones reasons for embracing the Apache ""lifestyle"" remain as veiled as the rest of his character. I still think a bit of Apache blood would be a great explanation for Blanchetts otherworldly beauty. Return to the corrected sentence.

"21 Grams Way Too Heavy washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids 21 Grams Way Too Heavy Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 28 2003 EVIDENTLY ALEJANDRO Gonzalez IA+-arritu maker of ""Amores Perros"" wants lightning to strike twice. The 2000 ""Amores Perros"" set in Mexico was a remarkable drama of connected fates and time-fractured story lines all brought together by a car accident. ""21 Grams"" his latest is set in the United States. A far less remarkable drama of connected fates and time-fractured story lines its also centered around an accident. Swamped in denatured colors (the official look of spiritual desperation) ""21 Grams"" doesnt lack for dramatic import. Naomi Watts Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn deliver high-impact performances that take you right through the movie. But the cumulative effect feels over the top this time. ""21 Grams"" which refers to the apparent weight loss that everyone experiences immediately after dying seems to take on too much weight. Its so laden with foreboding you want to get out from under it and gasp for air. If not for its show-offy back-and-forthing of time the movie would be a banal pointlessly depressing exercise. You feel a subversive need to shake these characters by their shoulders and yell ""I command you to stop having such miserable lives Find a Marx Brothers movie immediately"" Watts plays Cristina a recovering drug addict now married to an architect. Shes the mother of two young children. Penn is Paul Rivers a math teacher dying of heart disease whose wife Mary (Charlotte Gainsbourg) desperately wants a child. Del Toro is Jack an ex-convict who is trying his best to tread the religious straight and narrow. But for a former hard drinker with a wife (Melissa Leo) who misses his bad old ways living through Jesus is not an easy thing. When Paul finally gets the heart transplant he needs his rejuvenation makes him want to find the donor. This leads him to Cristina who has returned to her cocaine habit after a personal catastrophe. Imagine the worst you can and youve got the plot. To tell more is to give away the movies grand -- or perhaps not so grand -- design. Also figuring in there is Jack whose bighearted desire to set his life straight meets with debilitating crisis after crisis. Theres even more torment ahead for everyone. And guilt. And redemption. Its pretty much a movie to commit suicide by. I dont mean to make fun of movies that take on such powerful issues. Most of the time Im a sucker for them. But this time around those issues have an overbearing grandiosity. They are great billboards of gravitas with nothing but wooden scaffolding behind them. And these three characters dont feel authentic but rather brought together simply because of the collective conceits of IA+-arritu and scriptwriter Guillermo Arriaga (who also scripted ""Amores Perros""). This movie smacks too obviously of omniscient manipulation. The hand of God -- or the mystical force that causes these events -- should be more imperceptible and therefore more powerful. 21 GRAMS (R 126 minutes) -- Contains drug use violence obscenity sexual scenes and emotionally distressing material.

"21 Grams The Chaotic Order Of the Universe washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On 21 Grams The Chaotic Order Of the Universe Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday November 26 2003 Under its seemingly chic despair its celebration of squalor and pain its violence its willfully skewed narrative scheme ""21 Grams"" turns out to be a powerful relic from a bygone age Its really a ""miracle of faith"" movie as straight-ahead religious as ""Song of Bernadette."" It argues that yes God has a plan clever and meaningful and that coded in all human actions are messages from above. Like most works of evangelical intensity it works toward revelation a moment of clarity when mere humans can at last spy the grandeur the intricacy the genius of Gods plan. All this in a movie with Sean Penn? Hard to believe I know but thats what makes the thing so utterly engrossing -- even if you are as I was lost for the first half-hour. The director Alejandro Gonzalez IA+-arritu (he broke through on ""Amores Perros"" in 2001) avoids chronological order as if it were a plague. His narrative model is instead the mosaic He picks moments from the stories of his three protagonists by devious plan at different parts of their lives in different states of grace. The literal-minded will have trouble figuring out how say Naomi Watts can be a super-perky proficient suburban mom in one scene and a wasted blowzy drugged-up near-zombie in the next; or how Penn can be the very image of academic propriety in one sequence complete to tweeds and irony; in the next a man in intensive care with tubes and pipes and drips and monitors keyholed into every spare inch of flesh; and in still another a disreputable upchucking gunman sitting by an empty swimming pool with a Smith amp; Wesson in one hand and a look of self-loathing crunching up his face. But by far the most interesting character is the prime mover who unites Wattss Christina and Penns Paul Jack Jordan played by Benicio Del Toro is an ex-con whos been born again and given himself over to the Lord in a storefront church where he works as an assistant to a stern mentor of a minister who instructs him forcefully ""Jesus knows where every hair on your head is."" That statement may seem absurd to conventional minds but the argument of the movie turns out to be Jesus knows where every hair on your head is. Jacks problem is that he is well Jack. He has given himself to Christ but he cannot control the ready instinct to violence to sloppiness to indulgence to jailhouse tattoos as emblems of the dangerous-outsider culture that made him a criminal in the first place. It is he who authors the movies central event by which all the characters index themselves. One night driving home in a hurry after having lost his day job -- this is the inciting event but by the films narrative strategy it is not revealed until the halfway point -- he strikes and kills three pedestrians a man and his two daughters in a suburb then flees. Christina is the mother and wife of those who died; Paul terminally ill becomes the recipient of the heart from her husbands chest. One can certainly see why such a trio of powerhouse performers was attracted to this project. For actors the movie is pure candy a succession of gigantic actorly moments to be painted in the brightest of primary colors grief (Christina gets the news) remorse (Jack realizes what he has done) anguish (Paul attempts to understand why he has been spared a sure death from heart failure at the expense of three innocent lives) as well as such other fun things as drug addiction (Christina turns junkie in the aftermath) vengeance (Paul gets that gun and goes hunting to settle the score and establish justice) and bitterness (having given his life to Jesus Jack cannot understand why Jesus punished him by putting him behind the wheel of a truck that struck three innocent people). So the movie is right on that thin membrane between pathos and bathos. It has so many Big Emotional Moments so many tears are shed so many screams are screamed that its almost but not quite funny. Two things redeem the awful lugubriousness of the project First is the brilliance even the fearlessness of the argument and second is the raw honesty of the production. In some sense ""21 Grams"" -- the title incidentally refers to the weight that a body eerily loses at the instant of death that could be construed as the weight of the soul -- is a pure theological argument playing two theories of grace off each other. Jacks quest is literal biblical a rack of discipline and punishment (he regularly abuses his children out of a disciplinarians hunger at one point striking his son while bellowing ""No fighting in this house""). Pauls is more modern being driven not by formal engagement with religion as structure and community but more as a philosophical quest for a meaning to life specifically his own. He has to find out why the price was paid to ensure his survival and insists to himself at any rate that there is a reason behind it. (He is a mathematician a professional quester for secret patterns.) Meanwhile he has fallen out of sympathy with his own wife Mary (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who has some desperate need to bear his child. Paul -- his anger is puzzling -- does not want to procreate possibly because he has not yet found his meaning or if there is any meaning at all. If theres not whats the point of adding another victim to the chaos? As these two views work themselves out it becomes clear that the director prefers Pauls more instinctive quest to Jacks dogmatic insistence but I was struck by the fairness of the inquiry. Movies about born-agains are almost always front-loaded with contempt. Its so easy to make fun of them with their earnestness their literalism their obsession with Scripture their utter rigidity but Gonzalez IA+-arritu never does. The movie is too relentlessly honest for that. Gonzalez IA+-arritu who directs from a script by his colleague Guillermo Arriaga (who also wrote ""Amores Perros"") looks at these folks unflinchingly with a brilliant eye for detail as he puts together the pattern that becomes their lives and their destiny. We flash forward and backward in time -- you must be patient -- as we basically come to understand the before the during and the after of the intersection of these three lives and what it comes to. The movie isnt pretty. Rodrigo Prietos photography grainy and bled of color conjures up the scabby sourness of a certain anti-idealized version of reality. And parts of the movie are hard to take. I have no need to watch a mother receive news that her family has been capriciously wiped out but the film gave me no choice. ""21 Grams"" begins with an image of birds in an urban landscape suddenly breaking into helter-skelter flight. Thats Gonzalez IA+-arritus metaphor for chaos for the possibility that life is random atoms splattered this way and that by other random atoms. That too is the narrative strategy a confusing jumble of seemingly random scenes beyond the capacity of human organization. When the accident happens the director doesnt picture it directly. Rather he watches as a stricken witness a maintenance man drops his leaf-blower and runs to help the tragedy offscreen. The leaf-blower falls into the leaves and sends them swirling; its another image of cruel randomness. But by movies end the birds have returned to their roosts. Thats the miracle it depicts -- order has been restored. And the movie itself is a miracle tough smart relentless provocative and above all serious. 21 Grams (125 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for emotional intensity sex and violence.

In essence thats what the films about life death and the sometimes-quiet sometimes-terrible rhythms thereof. Watching it is a wrenching experience; the usual layers of distance between actors and audience are stripped away and we not only watch their anguish but become part of it. Paul (Sean Penn) is a gravely ill professor awaiting a heart transplant; early on we see him in his bathroom carefully removing his respirator and smoking a forbidden cigarette. Cristina (Naomi Watts) is a recovering addict who adores her husband and young daughters; Jack (Benicio Del Toro) an ex-con trying to re-establish himself with his family and faith. These people live in the same anonymous city but have no connection moving in different worlds -- until a tragic accident brings them together. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""21 Grams"" with Sean Penn Naomi Watts Benicio Del Toro Charlotte Gainsbourg Melissa Leo Clea DuVall. Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. 125 minutes. Rated R for language sexuality some violence and drug use. Several theaters. Like ""Amores Perros"" the previous collaboration of director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga ""21 Grams"" tells three separate stories; more so than the previous movie it twists and whips the stories together creating a seemingly random timeline thats challenging to follow. The story starts in the middle wanders back to the beginning and eventually makes its way to an end. Its disorienting to watch and some will question whether the convoluted storytelling adds to or takes away from the drama. Like some of the characters the audience is without an anchor; we spend much of the movie sorting out just whats going on -- weve got a soulful puzzle to process just as Inarritus three tragic heroes do. Shot with a hand-held camera by Rodrigo Prieto (cinematographer for ""Amores Perros"") the characters are literally shown in shades of gray; all have dark hollow smudges under their eyes. And under this harsh bleached-out spotlight the actors deliver beautiful work. Penn in particular has a quiet nobility to him; he looks much older than he did in ""Mystic River"" and his thin face has a gravitas to it his eyes pained and yet gentle. The title of ""21 Grams"" refers to the weight the body loses at the time of death. Its a lyrical image -- the weight of the soul? The emotional weight shifted to those we leave behind? In the end as snowflakes fall softly on a shabby motel pool Inarritu manages to leave us hopeful; hes shown us his characters souls in all their raw beauty.

Starring Sean Penn Naomi Watts Benicio Del Toro. Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Written by Guillermo Arriaga. (R. 125 minutes.) Much of ""21 Grams"" the provocative drama from the makers of ""Amores Perros"" seems to take place at dusk. Not at the vaunted ""magic hour"" mind you but just afterward when the sun is doomed but doesnt know it yet. Few glimmers of hope pierce the hypnotic gloom of this picture which takes its title from the amount of weight a body supposedly loses at the instant of death -- the weight of a soul. Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga are most concerned though with the heavy burden of trying to save a soul while its still around. Redemption a guarantee in most American films is more like a guideline here. Inarritu and Arriagas first English-language film doesnt approach the brilliance of ""Amores Perros"" but it succeeds on a more modest scale. Handheld camerawork creates an uneasy intimacy; a flash-forward flashback narrative foretells grief retreats to normalcy then wallops the viewer with violence. To get an idea of how grave things are consider that Sean Penn his prematurely lined face by now an emblem of cinematic anguish is the films lightest figure -- and his character Paul is dying. Penns college professor wheezing and sneaking cigarettes as he awaits a new heart is the least troubled in a trio of characters linked by a criminal act and beset by spiritual weakness. Naomi Watts plays Cristina a homemaker and recovering addict who falls for Penns healthier incarnation and Benicio Del Toro an ex-con eager to subsume his past in fundamentalist religion. (To say more about the characters tie would give too much away -- the movies dots are rather easy to connect.) Each character is barely skirting a fatal or at least lethal flaw. Rocked by a horrific event the homemaker quickly reverts to drugs and alcohol. The ex-con goes overboard on proselytizing as he once did on bad behavior. The professor has not just a bum ticker but also the emotional opacity to stay with a wife he no longer wants (a wan Charlotte Gainsbourg) because shes taking care of him. Penn and Watts two actors attuned to griefs proximity to sexual desire show terrific chemistry but their characters slightly twisted motives make it hard to root for them as a couple. The pairing of troubled souls is fascinating to watch but in the way a Mike Tyson fight can still fascinate. Penn handily traverses the films jerking narrative structure gasping for life in one scene charming Watts character the next. I prefer the flirty Penn simply as a change of pace. Having seen him embody so many somber characters over the past several years its nice to see him grin again. Watts is riveting but shes much better in scenes of extreme emotion than in those requiring subtlety. For instance Watts quiet breakdown when her character hears awful news is upstaged by Clea DuValls heartrending work in the same scene as Cristinas sister struggling to hold back tears. Del Toro excels at playing a man uncomfortable in his own skin. Its as if the world is an 8-foot-tall door frame and this guy is 9 feet 2. The actors searching wary eyes give his character too much conflict to be either a good criminal or a good Christian. Pervading the picture is the idea that you can stave off personal demons only to the extent you can control fate -- a concept that runs counter to our ""Dr. Phil"" 12-step society of reinvention. The payoff in ""21 Grams"" comes not from watching characters achieve or overcome but from the recognition of their struggle not to give up the fight. -- Advisory This film contains violence raw language nudity strong sexuality.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Sean Penn plays a college professor in need of a heart transplant in 21 Grams. By Jim Sheldon Focus Features 21 Grams unstintingly explores and exposes excruciating pain raw grief ruinous vengeance and life-affirming resilience creating human portraits that are uncommonly exhilarating in their honesty. This is cinematic art in its highest form. (Related video Watch the trailer for 21 Grams) Like Mystic River its portrayal of grim experiences can be hard to sit through. But also like Mystic River its performances are so riveting -- and so far superior to most of what we generally see in movies -- they make the movie well worth the discomfort. More about the movie 21 Grams     stars out of four Stars Sean Penn Naomi Watts Benicio Del Toro Melissa Leo Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Distributor Focus Features Rating R for language sexuality some violence and drug use Opens Nov. 21 in New York and Los Angeles The two movies share the same star Sean Penn whose extraordinary performance in both affirms his status as one of the best actors of his generation. Naomi Watts fulfills the promise she showed in Mulholland Drive and gives the most heart-wrenching performance of any actress so far this year. Filling out the films starring troika is Benicio Del Toro who hasnt been this good since his Oscar-winning turn in Traffic. Its only the second film -- and the first in English -- for Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu whose Amores Perros (2000) also was a triumph. Presented in a fractured nonlinear style like Amores Perros all the parts of the narrative puzzle dont come together until the end. But each piece of the dark tale satisfies as much as the whole. An accident and its reverberations throw together three strangers (Penn Watts and Del Toro). What springs from this fateful collision covers a continuum of emotion from redemptive love to hateful revenge. Penn plays a college professor in need of a heart transplant. His wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is set on getting pregnant and having his child. Watts is a suburban wife and mother of two young daughters who overcame a troubled past. Del Toro is an ex-con recently released from prison where he found God. He is doing his best to hold down a steady job and provide for his wife and two young children. The mysterious title is not a drug reference. Rather it refers to the weight that the human body immediately loses at the moment of death. We are told that 21 grams is equivalent to the weight of a hummingbird or five nickels. It also could be the weight of the human soul. 21 Grams creates such a palpably dark atmosphere that one sits through the movie almost cowering in dread for what may come next. Yet one emerges extraordinarily moved by the films harsh beauty.

In the meantime Independent Los Angeles the inaugural film series at CalArts multi-use REDCAT theater space inside the Disney Concert Hall represents an important attempt at reclamation one that aspires to redefine independent cinema -- which is to say cinema that is independent not just financially but ideologically -- in the era of Tarantino Sundance and studio-owned specialty divisions. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Curated by CalArts film school dean Steve Anker and critic and festival programmer Berenice Reynaud the extraordinary four-day exhibition comprises nearly 50 short and feature-length films spanning the spectrum from animation to live-action documentary to fiction and narrative to experimental. But what is perhaps most notable about the series is how little its films have in common beyond the fact that theyre seldom screened and that most of their makers are L.A.-based. Its hard to think of the last time such an eclectic and rare bunch of films were grouped together under one roof in this city suggesting that REDCATs future programming will be well worth keeping an eye on.Just as the ""independent"" in the series title refers as much (or more) to the artistic vision of the works on display as it does to their budgets so does the ""Los Angeles"" imply films that filter the city through a unique personal expressiveness films like Billy Woodberrys Bless Their Little Hearts (1984) one of the most quietly perceptive heart-wrenching films ever made about the struggles of the working class. Set to a wailing blues soundtrack that amplifies the anger disappointment and humiliation of its protagonist -- a once-proud African-American man (Nate Hardman) drifting between a series of dead-end day-labor jobs -- the film is a devastating frieze of scenes from lives lived at or near the poverty line among naked light bulbs unadorned plaster walls and secondhand housedresses. It is a movie about people most movies are never about who live in neighborhoods most movies never bother to show. And though it has become virtually unknown in the two decades since its making it remains an authentic masterpiece of American independent cinema.Two decades on the other hand may not be nearly enough to fully sort out Damon Packards way underground Reflections of Evil in which an obese mamas boy (Packard) given to mass consumption of sugar products and frightening Tourettes-like outbursts wanders the citys streets and terrorizes its denizens. Its an audacious very funny shock-satire that suggests William Lustig by way of John Waters and it may well repel as many viewers as it fascinates. But nothing about Reflections of Evil is nearly as disquieting as any one moment from Grover Babcock and Blue Hadaeghs documentary A Certain Kind of Death about the processing of human corpses through the various L.A. County agencies responsible for their transportation attempted identification and ultimate disposal. Unsparing and unironic in its attention to the smallest grisliest details the film is fascinating for its macabre trappings but even more so for its immersion into an office atmosphere where such trappings go almost unnoticed -- a place where death is the business and where a box of cremated remains is no more aberrant than a box of copy paper.

Sep. 13 600pm Of course not all the filmmakers take Los Angeles as their subject; some like experimental filmmaker Sharon Lockhart cast as far afield as the Brazilian opera house where Werner Herzog shot scenes for Fitzcarraldo while others like the late abstract animator Jules Engel just happen to have called the place home at one time or another. Dating from the early 1960s Engels marvelous abstract shorts largely employ shapes and lines in intensely choreographed fractal-like arrangements that when combined with various original soundtracks -- a jig a pastorale -- make it seem as though we are seeing the images form in our subconscious. Then just when you think youve got him figured out Engel throws out a curve ball like Silence a computer-animated piece that shows us edges and outlines of forms that threaten to appear but never quite do. If only the same could be said about 21 Grams the much-anticipated second film directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and scripted by Guillermo Arriaga -- the duo responsible for the dazzling 2000 triptych Amores Perros. That film was flashy and fast the storylines often cartoonishly over the top but somehow it was all of a piece as its distinct melodramas gradually revealed themselves to be interconnected. The movie left an undeniable impact and when I thought about revisiting it before seeing 21 Grams I found I didnt need to -- its sights and sounds were more vivid in my mind three years after the fact than those of most movies Id seen since. In particular I found myself wondering whatever became of that bedraggled dog lover and reformed hit man El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria) last seen trudging off across a desolate muddied landscape in the films final shot. Not long into 21 Grams I continued to wonder the same thing. For where Amores Perros was a feast of energy wit and imagination 21 Grams is like a starvation diet -- a movie that wallows so profoundly in its own misery that watching it is like atoning for some sin you didnt commit.How much suffering is enough suffering? As far as Inarritu and Arriaga are concerned there appears to be no reasonable limit. While the people of Amores Perros suffered they also carried on with their lives. For the characters of 21 Grams suffering is all there is; theyre martyrs in training. In the minds of Inarritu and Arriaga its hardly enough that Cristina (Naomi Watts) should lose her husband (Danny Huston) and two young daughters in a gruesome hit-and-run -- best to make her a cocaine addict too so she can be withdrawn and morose even in the scenes before the accident. And why make the receipt of a long-awaited heart transplant anything other than a temporary respite for the dying Paul (Sean Penn) when it makes for a more purifying bit of cinema -- more vomit more agony more weight-fluctuating method-acting -- if his ravaged body also comes to reject heart number two? Which is to say nothing of the brooding driver (Benicio Del Toro) of the murderous truck whose guilt over his unconfessed crime only deepens the shame already festering inside him over his failings as a husband and father.As in Amores Perros the order of events has been jumbled up but the device here feels like just that a pandering manipulative device. Rather than the sense that were watching a series of distinct self-sustaining narratives that just happen to intersect we feel like were watching a single story thats been diced up in the hopes of disguising how hopelessly convoluted it is. So we may not realize right away that Pauls new heart is the one formerly belonging to Cristinas dead husband. Or that Cristina will eventually enlist Paul to track down her familys killer. But by the time Del Toro angrily exclaims ""This is hell right here"" while pointing animatedly at his own head we have a pretty good idea of what hes feeling.21 Grams is being pushed hard by its studio Focus Features as a top awards contender and it may be that the publicity wizards are on to something. This could be the years perfect picture for those disposed to confusing artifice with art. Certainly thats the trap Inarritu and Arriaga have fallen into. Perhaps feeling the need -- as filmmakers following up great success often do -- to make something that much more serious and contemplative than their prior picture they seem to have decided that the more they pile on the still solemn affectations the more well be compelled to think deeply about the movies big theme death. (The films title is a reference to the urban legend that a human body loses 21 grams -- the weight of the soul -- at the exact moment of death.) Yet once you peel away all the nonlinear editing bleached-out cinematography and vehicular manslaughter thats been retained however superficially from their earlier collaboration youre left with a movie so self-flagellatingly ascetic that suddenly Ordinary People starts to look like a movie you can go to for a raucous chuckle.INDEPENDENT LOS ANGELES | At the Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater (REDCAT) Thurs.-Sun.

"21 Grams | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 21-grams ) 21 Grams (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli 21 Grams is a stunning kaleidoscope of a motion picture - a mosaic of images that gradually resolves itself into a powerful tale of tragedy and redemption. Not only is this one of the years most compelling motion pictures but in terms of structure its also one of the most intriguing and unique. Not since Memento has a movie so successfully employed a non-linear chronology. The jigsaw puzzle approach used by director Alejandro GonzA!lez IA+-A!rritu keeps us far more intrigued than a conventional vision of identical material would. Its difficult to provide any kind of plot summary that doesnt give away crucial details so Ill stick to the bare facts. 21 Grams centers around three main characters whose fates intersect at a crucial moment. Paul (Sean Penn) is a math professor with a bad heart. His marriage to Mary (Charlotte Gainsbourg) seems as doomed as he is but she refuses to leave him in his terminal state. She wants to have his child via artificial insemination but without a heart transplant he will not live long enough to see his offspring. Jack (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-con who has reformed his life through devotion to Jesus. But there are times especially in his home life when glimpses of his past personality shine through. Christine (Naomi Watts) is a happily married woman with a loving husband and two delightful daughters. She is content with her daily routine until events send her life spinning out of control impelling her back into the drug-induced haze from which her marriage rescued her. Had 21 Grams been presented in a linear manner it would have been an engaging occasionally harrowing motion picture. The themes would have been the same and the acting which is of the highest caliber wouldnt have been any different. Yet it would have been a fundamentally different motion picture. By piecing events together in this unconventional manner IA+-A!rritu forces us to pay scrupulous attention from the very beginning. We are hypersensitized to everything that occurs and it allows us to absorb much more than we might under ""normal"" circumstances. Plus we are intellectually engaged from the beginning. In that we are called upon to piece together a puzzle one could argue that 21 Grams is almost an interactive motion picture. At first the movie is confusing. Its as if the filmmakers assembled about 50 scenes all two to four minutes in length and randomly edited them together. 21 Grams moves backwards and forwards in time and jumps from character to character with dizzying frequency. But out of what initially seems to be a maddeningly random approach a pattern emerges. It becomes clear that InA!rritu is paving a narrative path in a spiral that curves ever closer to a series of key moments. Past future and present are all converging. It takes a little while but a picture begins to emerge from the fog. Then its just a matter of putting the pieces in the right places. Another strength of IA+-A!rritus approach is that it results in a deeper empathy with the characters. By seeing them in a wide variety of circumstances during a compressed time frame we come to relate to them far more quickly than we would had this story been told in a chronological fashion. We know bits and pieces of where they have been and where they are headed and this can make it feel a little like playing an amnesiac God. For Sean Penn this represents an amazing one-two punch alongside Mystic River. Penn might not only have given the best male performance of the year but the second-best as well and its difficult to determine whether hes better here or in Clint Eastwoods movie. Hes more subdued in 21 Grams since hes playing a dying man with a guilt-ridden conscience but the same kinds of moral issues confront Paul as those that confront Penns Mystic River character. Its interesting to see the different ways in which the situations are resolved. Naomi Watts has seen her star ascend quickly in the past few years (ever since she appeared in Mulholland Drive) and with every new performance it has increased in magnitude. In terms of serious acting this is easily her most impressive effort. Like Penns and Del Toros alter-egos her character is forced to undergo several radical transformations. And it most definitely is not a glamorous role. There are scenes where shes strung out on drugs and looks like she hasnt bathed in weeks. Benicio Del Toro is no less impressive than either of his co-stars although his part is arguably the least showy of the three main roles. Jack is a sincere man who undergoes a crisis of faith. The key to Del Toros portrayal is sincerity. Jack doesnt come across as a religious hypocrite. Hes someone who genuinely believes what he preaches and feels intense guilt whenever he strays from the path. 21 Grams invites us to understand the religious mindset not to dismiss it. Visually the film is dark and grainy with a desaturated palette of colors. The music is slow and moody. All of this is appropriate to InA!rritus overall stylistic intent. Although the tone is brooding and somber 21 Grams offers a nugget of hope through one of its themes - that of redemption which is clearly something the director believes in. In some ways this is similar to IA+-A!rritus recent outing Amores Perros which also reveled in the darkness of human nature and used a non-linear narrative. However despite its multiple tragedies 21 Grams is fundamentally more optimistic because the characters are sympathetic. Theyre certainly not all saints but we feel for them. Few films released in 2003 can boast having as many strengths as 21 Grams. It is in a word amazing. Its one of those motion pictures that haunts your thoughts and wont let go. Like Memento it virtually demands a second viewing to understand and appreciate the storys complexity and to recognize the artistry inherent in all of the transitions. I give this film my highest recommendation. 21 Grams (United States 2003) Director Alejandro GonzA!lez IA+-A!rritu Cast Sean Penn Benicio Del Toro Naomi Watts Charlotte Gainsbourg Danny Huston Clea DuVall Marc Musso Screenplay Guillermo Arriago Cinematography Rodrigo Prieto Music Gustavo Santaolalla U.S. Distributor Focus Features Ranked 3 in Berardinellis Top 10 of 2003 Run Time 205 U.S. Release Date 2003-11-21 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Violence Profanity Nudity Sexual Situations) Genre DRAMA Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Cider House Rules The (1999) Maria Full of Grace (2004) Lilya 4-Ever (2003) worse movies of this genre Hole in My Heart A (2005) Neon Demon The (2016) Showgirls (1995) Three...better movies of Sean Penn Dead Man Walking (1996) Mystic River (2003) Milk (2008) worse movies of Sean Penn All the Kings Men (2006) All the Kings Men (2006) I Am Sam (2001) Three...better movies of Benicio Del Toro Sin City (2005) Usual Suspects The (1969) Things We Lost in the Fire (2007) worse movies of Benicio Del Toro Che (2009) Wolfman The (2010) Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) Three...better movies of Naomi Watts Funny Games (2008) King Kong (2005) Funny Games (spoilers) (2008) worse movies of Naomi Watts Ring 2 The (2005) Diana (2013) Demolition (2016) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1621,200,21grams17,21grams,reelviews

The texture of the image is grainy and ""real"" yet theres a tantalizing stark lyricism to the enigmatic opening shot of 21 Grams. Immediately we recognize Sean Penn and his cool aura of sullen experience. Yet who exactly are these two lovers with their luminous ominous vibe? ""21 Grams"" is a movie in which even the quietest moments are tantalizingly alive with hidden meaning. Theyre disconnected slivers of reality and the movie beckons the audience to put them back together. Directing his first English-language feature the spellbinding Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Amores Perros"") glides back and forth between past and present slicing time as if it were a ribbon. Heres Penn in a hospital arms laced with tubes and heres Naomi Watts the woman who was asleep beside him speaking at a recovery meeting and then moments later (but really earlier) in the middle of a drug binge. Heres Benicio Del Toro as a youth counselor with tattoos up to his neck giving testament to Gods power moments before he lashes out with what might be the devils wrath at the thug hes advising. Heres a nice husband (Danny Huston) and his two young daughters cell-phoning his wife from a mall diner and here are Del Toro Watts and a blood-soaked Penn enacting some violent deliverance in a dank hotel room. And heres Penn once again now being handed a jar that contains...his heart. ""21 Grams"" is like a mirror thats been smashed into 1000 shards and reassembled by Inarritu piece by glittery piece. That he does it with the solemnly hypnotic skill of a born showman makes the movie the latest example of what might be called an Art Ride. Here as in ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Memento"" events are fractured and overlapped so that even the most random catastrophe - like say a hit-and-run accident that leaves a trio of innocents dead in the road - acquires the dark aura of inevitability. A hush of impending cataclysm hovers over ""21 Grams"" which wants to be a parable of love death birth loss vengeance and (you guessed it) salvation. The title refers to nothing less than the weight of the soul. Its a startlingly crafted movie with several extraordinary performances and as long as were putting it together in our heads trying to puzzle out what these disparate characters have to do with one another were held in the grip of Inarritus somber passion. As a woman coping with impossible tragedy Watts digs to primal levels of bereavement and rage; she acts with a wounding force. Del Toro hushed implosive and totemic in his anger does his boldest work yet as an ex-con who has embraced Jesus with such a guilty fervor that even his attempts to be a good man are laced with burning sociopathology. Penn considering the extreme circumstances (which I wont reveal) that surround his character grounds the movie with his hipster hostility. Yet for all its lurches toward greatness ""21 Grams"" is paradoxically a movie that loses power the more you perceive whats actually going on in it. Laid end to end the story is to put it mildly overwrought fusing several cataclysms too many. Its a testament to Inarritus skill that he keeps you absorbed as intensely as he does. Its a measure of his pretensions that you leave ""21 Grams"" at once overwhelmed and exhausted eager to see him apply his wizardry to a tale that didnt depend on being obscured by it.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.
