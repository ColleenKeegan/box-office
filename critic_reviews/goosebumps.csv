It all begins in textbook 80s-adventure fashion with a single-parent family - mum Gale (Amy Ryan) and teenage son Zach (Dylan Minnette) - pitching up in a sleepy small town only to discover that their neighbour is a creepy weirdo who keeps his daughter on a short leash. Its not long before said weirdo is revealed to be retired writer Stine (Jack Black) whose spine-chilling creations have a habit of jumping off the page and wreaking havoc in the real world. For the first hour Goosebumps throws in so many sparky one-liners and pell-mell action set pieces that its shortcomings - creaky plot Blacks out-there accent a pair of slightly dull leads - are easy to overlook. It all spins out of control in a final blowout of naff special effects and random shouting but theres just enough leftover goodwill to carry it through.

As a child of the 90s I remember fondly reading the books and watching the really quite scary for kids TV show after school so as you can imagine I was bursting at the seams with anticipation with the news of a new movie. With bonus points being added that it had Jack Black in it. Although not a patch on the shows or books the movie was entertaining and a nice family movie for a Sunday afternoon. I liked the idea of the books coming to life but I think they could have chosen a few other titles to escape like the Egg Monsters from Mars or the killer Snowman from the classic beware the snowman. But apart from that the movie did its job and did it well.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore9 days agoTiago AlmeidaTastemakerFeaturedStarring Jack Black this is the perfect movie for those with young children or with a Peter Pan syndrome (like me).It is based on a book series with the same name by R. L. Styne and its all about letting our fantasies fly wild. Monsters left and right - from their version of the Abominable Snowman to Werewolfs - and even having time for a bit of teenager romance.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 18 2015Julie RTastemakerFeaturedI saw the gala premiere of this film with my son as part of the BFI London Film Festival.  Having enjoyed episodes of Goosebumps previously shown on TV we had high hopes for this film and we were not disappointed.  The film is not based on one particular book but contains a lot of characters from the books the main baddy being Slappy the dummy.

Its very much a 1993 book--shes upset at her best friend whos away at camp and ignoring her letters--and it doesnt age as well as other beloved childrens books might with a dragging story very little action and goofy cliffhangers. (At the end of one chapter Hannah thinks theres a hooded demon on her bed. At the start of the next she sees its just a coat.)Related Story Horror for Kids So compared to The Ghost Next Door the Goosebumps film adaptation starring Jack Black as the author R.L. Stine seems impressive. Its got a slick adventurous feel good scares clever all-ages humor and the right balance of sincerity and self-deprecation. But in another crucial way the earlier book feels like a much more modern work despite being 22 years older.The book inspired the films character of Hannah Stine the authors teenage daughter who teams up with her new neighbor Zach when the monsters in her fathers books come to life. But book-Hannah achieved a surprising amount of depth and agency in the storys 124 pages aimed at those with a fourth-grade reading level no less. Meanwhile the film reduces her to a thinly written uncomplicated girl destined to serve only as a love interest to the main hero. In doing so it betrays the ethos of gender equality built into the book series from the very start and one element that made the Goosebumps series such a mega-selling phenomenon.  ""The secret of Goosebumps ... was it was the first book series to appeal equally to boys and girls"" Stine told The Washington Post in 2012 on the 20th anniversary of the series which has sold over 350 million copies. ""In fact these books were originally done for a girl audience. And then the fan mail started coming in and it was half from boys."" Anyone who read just a handful of Goosebumps books in elementary school would find this bit of trivia unsurprising. Stines books regularly featured both boys and girls as likable protagonists fighting killer cameras werewolves or ventriloquist dummies.The Goosebumps film likely intended to do the same--and rightly so considering its audience on opening weekend was split evenly between males and females--but it fumbles most significantly with how it portrays its young heroine. The first big twist reveals that Hannah (Odeya Rush) is one of her fathers creations--a book character come to life. Stine tells Zach he wrote Hannah to be a good normal teenage girl someone to love and to act as his companion. Zach who has a growing crush on Hannah is devastated but agrees to hide her true identity. But it turns out that Hannah already knows ""A girl can only have so many 16th birthdays"" she tells Zach near the end with surreal matter-of-factness before shes swept back into a book along with the other monsters. Then comes the second twist Stine surprises Zach by writing Hannahs character to life again and destroying the book she came from to guarantee she will never return to its pages. This is the happy ending; the fact that Zach will grow older and Hannah wont doesnt seem to be an issue.The film dwells more on Zachs sense of loss and existential frustration when he learns about Hannah. Meanwhile Hannah seems unrealistically at peace with it all--even though shes kept trapped in her house homeschooled by her paranoid dad and forced to relocate countless times. Shes brave funny accessible magical and beautiful in the way only idealized girls can be. And she doesnt have a say in her return to her book--Zach only realizes her fate once its too late. The film doesnt try hard to make the case that Hannahs as ""real"" as anyone else despite being from a book though it easily could have. Thats Goosebumpss implicit premise when it comes to the monsters after all.Compare this to The Ghost Next Door The twist is that Hannah Fairchild herself is the ghost and the revelation has more of an impact since shes the protagonist not the pretty sidekick and love interest. When she learns she died in a fire along with her whole family and was left stuck on earth without realizing it the book makes an effort to carve out her disorientation and sense of grief. Now Hannah understood why sometimes time seemed to stand still and sometimes it floated by so quickly. Ghosts come and go she thought sadly. And It was all beginning to make sense to Hannah. The dreamlike summer days. The loneliness. The feeling that something wasnt right. Even earlier in the book Hannahs self-aware and determined--she agonizes over whether shes doing the right thing by spying on her neighbor she worries that hell think shes crazy before concluding that maybe she is crazy. The film instead transfers all this emotional and psychological turmoil to Zach and Stine. And while movie-Hannahs fate is controlled in the most literal sense by the men and boys in her life book-Hannah picks her own destiny. When her neighbor is trapped in a burning house near the end of the book she rushes into the flames to save him in an act of sacrifice that sets her free.The film gives short shrift to its other female characters too. The wonderful Amy Ryan (The Office The Wire) plays Zachs mom but spends little time on screen influencing the plot. Jillian Bell (22 Jump Street Workaholics) is hilarious as usual as Zachs aunt but her character is painted as man-crazy and desperate--and she later ends up with Stine. Zachs dorky friend Champ has a crush on a popular girl who appears once to make fun of him and then a second time for Champ to rescue her--and to reward him with a kiss.Of the 10 highest-grossing films in 2015 two are kid-friendly and feature female leads Inside Out and Cinderella. Goosebumps feels caught between the two. Its source material is a lot like Inside Out--deeply interested in the thoughts and emotions of girls. But the film itself is a lot more like the traditional and unabashedly heteronormative Cinderella--all the main characters end up in some kind of romantic relationship which detracts from the already flat depictions of its women and girls. So when the climax of Goosebumps ends with Stine Zach and Champ standing around the closed book that swallowed up Hannah it almost doesnt matter that she returns a couple scenes later. By that point the film has already shown it doesnt think shes real anyway.

Twitter Email previousGermany Clarifies Were Responsible for the HolocaustnextMore Students Are Eating Locally Sourced Food Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters How Chelsea Beat Ivanka at Being a Candidate Daughter Michelle Cottle The comparatively less flashy less spirited former First Kid managed to show her moms softer side at the DNC on Thursday. Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future. Continue Reading AP/The Atlantic What ISIS Really Wants Graeme Wood The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Heres what that means for its strategy--and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic States appeal. ""We have not defeated the idea"" he said. ""We do not even understand the idea."" In the past year President Obama has referred to the Islamic State variously as ""not Islamic"" and as al-Qaedas ""jayvee team"" statements that reflected confusion about the group and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

Stines monsters come to life in an entertaining thriller Add to ... Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 16 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 16 2015 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Rob Letterman Written by Darren Lemke Scott Alexander Larry Karaszewski Starring Jack Black Dylan Minnette Odeya Rush Classification PG Country USA Language English I suppose you could consider the Goosebumps movie as a piece of metafiction. It speculates what might happen if every monster ever invented by the American childrens author R.L. Stine in his popular Goosebumps series came to life at the same time. Crack open the book covers and the abominable snowman a giant preying mantis a posse of murderous ceramic gnomes and many many zombies are all let loose. Literally. Well perhaps not literally but at least physically thanks to the animators at Sony. In truth the concept - and the story woven by screenwriters Scott Alexander Larry Karaszewski and Darren Lemke to justify it - is more interesting than the rather predictable attack-of-the-killer-monsters that follows but with its strong premise an interesting third-act twist and the inimitable Jack Black in the role of Stine Goosebumps has some satisfying entertainment on offer.The story begins when our pleasant teenage hero Zach (Dylan Minnette) arrives in Madison Del. from New York accompanied by his recently widowed mother who is taking up a new job as vice-principal at the local high school. He soon meets the girl next door Hannah (Odeya Rush) who seems nice and takes him on a little stroll around an abandoned amusement park in the woods but her suspiciously secretive father catches them talking and warns Zach off the property.When Zach hears an ensuing father-daughter shouting match terminated by Hannahs screams he calls the cops who arrive at the house to find the noise only came from the movie that a very annoyed and apparently solitary Mr. Stine was watching. Convinced that he really did meet Hannah and that she is hidden in the house somewhere Zach and his new pal the nerdy Champ (Ryan Lee) break in setting in motion the events that will lead to opening up Mr. Stines locked manuscripts.One-on-one the monsters are engaging - one of the early sequences features an amusing brawl in the kitchen with the garden gnomes - but things become much less clever once Slappy the eerily independent ventriloquists dummy shows up and corrals all the other monsters into a lynch mob in a bid to get vengeance on their creator for keeping them locked up. Mr. Stine Hannah the boys and the monsters all eventually converge at the school dance where there are many scenes of stampeding crowds making it through doors just in time to slam them in the faces of various pursuing monsters.Still director Rob Letterman and the screenwriters have another trick or two up their sleeves plus a few romantic subplots including the not entirely predictable hook-up between Zach and Hannah while Blacks reliable presence as the increasingly less grumpy Mr. Stine anchors the film. This is horror intended for the prepubescent set; it gently mocks the traditions of the genre - giant preying mantis rips roof off high school - while never getting too frightening.

Credit Columbia By Peter Travers October 16 2015 More News Fall Movie Preview 2015 From James Bond to Star Wars 40 Best YA Novels 100 Years 100 Maverick Movies All Stories >> Jack Black fires up this crazy-scary-funny film version of R.L. Stines bestselling kid-lit horror tales. Stine wrote more than a hundred of these spooky buggers. Too much to cram into one movie? Youd think. But director Rob Letterman working from a script by Darren Lemke stuffs about 25 monsters into the frenzied fray. More News Fall Movie Preview 2015 From James Bond to Star Wars 40 Best YA Novels 100 Years 100 Maverick Movies All Stories >> Related Behind Jack Blacks Dark Comeback Why the star of grim TV satire The Brink and indie cringe-comedy The D Train left feel-good laughs behind Its a neat trick done by having Stine (Black) live like a hermit in the burbs of Madison Delaware when hes actually living above a metaphorical volcano. Ill explain. Though Stine has  a daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush) he keeps her in his private pumpkin shell. Theres a reason. If anyone opens one of Stines Goosebumps books monsters will pop off the pages and raise unholy hell. Like thats not going to happen. The action starts when a New York teen Zach (the appealing Dylan Minnette) moves in next door with his widowed mom (Amy Ryan) and starts nosing around.  Zach has an instant attraction to Hannah and soon theres no fence Stine can build that will keep the two apart. Its the secret Stine is hiding that creates the only impediment to true love. What secret? Ill never tell. Suffice it to say that Zach and his BFF Champ (Ryan Lee) quickly sneak into Stines library and crack open a book. And pow its the  Abominable Snowman of Pasadena. Nonstop mayhem follows in a stampede of comic terrors ready made for Halloween. Sure its exhausting. But Goosebumps knowing its audience lets it rip.

Stines immensely popularA GoosebumpsA books (my son isnt old enough for them yet so Im biding my time) but as far as I can tell their appeal comes from a genuinely impressive balancing act. How does one walk this line between kid-friendly trifle and genuinely creepy schlock-fest satisfying young readers burgeoning taste for the macabre while keeping things harmless and fun? Whats more Stines books arent elaborate tomes like the Harry Potter series (which admittedly have their own absorbing appeal). He seems to do it all with such a light disposable touch. The movie version ofA GoosebumpsA replicates that balancing act. Its a cheerful nasty delight. The setup is a familiar one; youve seen it in just about every other tween-friendly movie or book or TV show. Zach (Dylan Minnette) and his recently widowed mom (Amy Ryan) are relocating to Madison Delaware -- the middle of nowhere as far as hes concerned -- so she can be vice-principal of the local high school. Zach runs afoul of their menacing mysterious neighbor (Jack Black) after he befriends the mans beautiful sassy daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush). Concerned that Hannah might be in danger Zach sneaks into their house one night with his newfound nerdy school pal Champ (perpetually cry-faced Ryan Lee). After walking through a basement littered with bear traps and cobwebs they come upon a wall of manuscripts for Goosebumps stories each one locked. When they accidentally unlock one of the books the Abominable Snowman of Pasadena steps out of its pages and into their world cutting a wide swath of destruction through their own rinky-dink town. It turns out Hannahs dad is the elusive R.L. Stine himself and that the creatures he dreamed up in his stories became real somewhere along the way. Theyre kept under lock and key in the books ... or at least they were. Another volume opens and out steps the eerie Slappy ""a ventriloquists dummy with a Napoleonic complex"" who then proceeds to unleash the creatures from all the other stories. Soon Madison Delaware is overrun by graveyard ghouls indestructible lawn gnomes a giant praying mantis Annihilator 3000 robots mutant plants and more and the unhinged mayhem spins further out of control. Fans of the Goosebumps series will probably enjoy picking out their favorites from the mad bunch -- the film is generous with its monster quotient. What makes the movie though is its wit and speed and the attention given to even the most basic character exchanges. Zach and his mom have easygoing snarky interactions but we also see the boy retire to his room every night to watch videos of his dead father; that in turn lends the banter with Mom real emotional context. (The film doesnt dwell on such details but their deployment never feels careless.) Meanwhile Black perfectly conveys the storys over-the-top hysterics while keeping things appropriately tongue-in-cheek and he knows his way around a gag verbal and otherwise. The best jokes here are the fastest ones and they often come as our heroes run from or fight some ghastly werewolf or alien or zombie or whatever. (""Why couldnt you have written about rainbows and unicorns?"" ""Because that doesnt sell 400 million copies"" ""Domestic?"" ""No Worldwide Still very impressive Shut up"") The conceit behind Goosebumps -- books/games/movies open up and the beasts inside them wreak havoc on our world -- isnt exactly new and it could easily become tiresome or cloying. But the movie never pauses long enough to let us get bored or annoyed. It has the feel of a story being spun before our very eyes -- fast funny and yes even frightening.

"Goosebumps | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; goosebumps ) Goosebumps (United States 2015) October 16 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli At a guess Id say that Goosebumps will satisfy its core audience - fans of R.L. Stines popular childrens books - and bore pretty much everyone else. The film which captures the feel if not the full charm of the written stories comes across as an autopilot low-scare monster movie targeted at 7 and 8-year olds. It doesnt work as either genuine horror or comedy; its a kids movie that recognizes it isnt sufficiently sophisticated to appeal to older viewers and doesnt make the attempt. Its few ""adult"" jokes are more obligatory than organic designed to throw a bone to parents having trouble staying awake. Theres a ""meta"" element at work here in that a fictionalized R.L. Stine (Jack Black) is one of the main characters. When the monsters from his books come to life in a Jumanji-esque fashion its up to him to write a new story to suck them all back into the world of imagination. Its not an especially inventive tale but it gives the visual effects crew an opportunity to go hog-wild. Goosebumps aficionados will spot many of their favorites the Abominable Snowman of Pasadena a werewolf a giant insect a mummy aliens with freeze guns zombies and (of course) Slappy the Ventriloquists (dont say it) Dummy. Oh and no garden gnomes were harmed during the making of this movie. Goosebumps is structured like one of Stines books. The protagonist is a teenage boy Zach (Dylan Minnette) who following his fathers death has recently moved with his mom (Amy Ryan) to a new house in Delaware. He collects two new friends the annoying weird Champ (Ryan Lee) and the cute spunky girl next-door Hannah (Odeya Rush). Unfortunately Hannah is kept under lock-and-key by her reclusive overprotective father who turns out to be author Stine. After the getting-to-know-you first act the creatures come out to play. Of course theres a twist but the movie is less concerned about plot than providing the opportunity for a Monster Mash. The actors playing Zach and Hannah are appealing. Dyan Minnette is a TV veteran having appeared in dozens of TV shows with a couple of feature films to boot. Odeya Rush doesnt have as many credits on her filmography but she has been in several movies including The Giver. Headliner Jack Black gives an amusingly warped interpretation of Stine (while also providing the vocal work for Slappy). I sometimes find Black grating but thats not the case here. In fact compared to Ryan Lees nails-on-blackboard irritating Champ hes agreeable. Stines original Goosebumps books were written during the 1990s. At the height of their popularity they spawned a TV series that ran for four seasons and a movie was planned as early as 1998 (with Tim Burton initially attached to direct). It has taken that project 17 years to reach the screen and one has the sense it may have arrived a generation too late. True a lot of young boys and girls read Goosebumps today but even kids are used to more sophisticated horror than what director Rob Letterman brings to the project. Id love to get into the mind of a 7-year old and see this through his/her eyes. Im sure the experience would be more positive. However for an older viewer this is generic and uninspired technically impressive (the special effects are nice although not cutting edge) but narratively lazy. The high point it arguably a cameo by the real R.L. Stine (playing ""Mr. Black"" in an in-joke that no one under 12 will get) but his appearance is an isolated moment of cleverness in a production that could use a little more imagination.

Stines books come to life (nearly all of them) in Rob Lettermans film in which the creations of Stine (Jack Black) are released and must be captured. With Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush.Still from ""Goosebumps"" starring Jack Black(Photo Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 stars out of 5The interaction between actors is what sells the movie.Eventually there are too many characters to keep up with but the core ones remain strong.File under happy surprises ""Goosebumps"" Rob Lettermans film based on the R.L. Stine books (pretty much all of them) is silly goofy a little scary a little poignant and a lot of fun.Stine has a good time with the genre writing about a host of supernatural and evil creatures and beings. Kids gobble up the books of course because Stine gets what so many childrens authors (and movie directors) dont Children like being scared.This is not a call to pop a batch of popcorn and plop down on the couch for a family viewing of ""The Exorcist."" The future therapy bills arent worth it. But kids dont like to be coddled or treated to overly ""safe"" fare and Stine delivers on that front.So does ""Goosebumps."" The film goes too wide and gets a little soft at the end but not fatally so. Its the rare horror film -- well sort of horror -- that you and your children can enjoy together.It begins with Zach (Dylan Minnette) moving unhappily with his widowed mother Gale (Amy Ryan) to tiny Madison Del. so that she can begin work as the assistant principal. Zach isnt the most outgoing of kids anyway; with his mom trying and failing to be cool the only friend he can scare up is Champ (Ryan Lee) a dweeby boy whose companionship sinks Zach further down the fit-in scale.But at home he finds another friend right next door Hannah (Odeya Rush) who likes to sneak out and roam around when shes not being home-schooled and kept inside by her creepy father.Thats Mr. Shivers (Jack Black) a nasty man who warns Zach to keep away from him his daughter their house and everything else. But when Zach hears a scream coming from the house he and Champ sneak in and find a bookshelf filled with bound copies of the ""Goosebumps"" series. They open one and ... well lets just say literature rarely comes to life quite so literally as it does here.AZCENTRALList of movies opening in fall 2015That development isnt really a spoiler as the entire movie hinges on it Mr. Shivers is in fact R.L. Stine himself and he keeps the books bound because if theyre opened the monsters inside escape and wreak havoc.Its a funny meta plot but when the evil ventriloquists dummy Slappy (voiced by Black) is released the story grows by leaps and bounds -- too fast and too much all of a sudden. Angry at being kept locked in a book Slappy wants revenge so he opens all the books releasing every abominable snowman evil garden gnome giant flying insect and whatever else you -- or more accurately Stine -- can think of.Its an intriguing premise taken about 10 steps too far. There are too many villains to keep track of; only Slappy really registers. Mostly its a special-effects circus as Stine tries to figure out how to get the genie back in the bottle as it were.But what makes it enjoyable is the cast and the actors interactions. Rush has a good time making Hannah a tomboy who longs for a more normal life while Minnette is fine as the good-natured shy Zach.AZCENTRALPhoenix Arizona Movie Theaters Showtimes ReviewsThe talented Ryan is mostly wasted (though not as badly here as in ""Bridge of Spies"") but Lee is terrific. Blessed with the ""gift of fear"" as he puts it hes never more than a shriek or scream away. He acts how every real kid would behave in a supernatural situation -- not preternaturally brave but scared to death.Eventually though it becomes Blacks movie. And as in (the superior) ""School of Rock"" ""Goosebumps"" gives him a good forum for his brand of manic insanity. You might act crazy too if a giant Ferris wheel was barreling down on you.Dont be misled -- ""Goosebumps"" isnt art and isnt trying to be. Its a fun movie that will make a nice entry into the Halloween canon every year when youre looking for something to watch with the kids.

Credit Columbia Pictures With hundreds of millions of copies floating around in the world the ""Goosebumps"" series abounds with fodder for a big-screen adaptation so its a wonder that all of those books havent spontaneously generated a movie by now (in addition to the 1990s TV show). Maybe the makers of the new feature film based on the books by R. L. Stine were thinking along the same lines because ""Goosebumps"" the movie takes quite literally the notion of the power of fiction to come alive. (Not to mention the power of novelists to be cranky loners.)Mr. Stine is an actual character in Rob Lettermans bells-and-whistles movie portrayed by Jack Black as the curmudgeonly neighbor of a new family in a small Maryland town. In the simple story Stines home library houses the zany titles that have been devoured by readers 8 and over from ""The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena"" to ""Night of the Living Dummy"" -- but with one crucial difference. Each volume can release an actual snowman or gnome horde or evil dummy like a genie let out of a bottle or taken all together like Pandoras box.A teenager Zack (Dylan Minnette) is the one unlucky enough to discover Stines secret after befriending the writers daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush). The two have a sweet flirtation but the bulk of this movie is a jam-packed pop-up book in the form of computer-generated imagery. Zack and his dorky sidekick Champ (Ryan Lee) inadvertently unleash Slappy the Dummy who in turn sets loose his fellow fictive hordes and ""Goosebumps"" becomes your standard kids cavalcade.Mr. Letterman and the writer Darren Lemke address the tough choices of adapting the classic Scholastic grade-school series by selecting ""all of the above."" The Snowman the Werewolf the Lawn Gnomes and other Stine stalwarts turn up to torment Zack and company who are joined by the persnickety author. As far as fidelity to the genial frights of the books Slappys relentlessness is slightly menacing as is the slobbering Werewolf but the action all feels more squealy than scary for children leavened by a steady flow of gentle sarcasm.The most genuinely creepy aspect of the story might be Stines temper introduced through his fiercely protective treatment of Hannah. All those monsters had to come from somewhere after all and when Mr. Black recites a back story about inventing them to shield himself from bullies a dark place opens up for a moment before being lost in the colorful C.G.I. avalanche. But any heart-baring emotion in the film is mostly roped off in stilted scenes in Mr. Lemkes screenplay. (Sample line ""Ive been running away my whole life."") Advertisement Continue reading the main story The movie has to keep reminding itself that there are other people in the set-like town. That includes everyone in Zachs high school which is hosting a dance and soon faces its own assault. Zachs mom is an assistant principal (Amy Ryan variably interested in being in this movie) and she has a goofily uncool sister (Jillian Bell) who falls for Stine here a single father. There are a couple of dopey cops but mostly the crew is running from one monster or another wreaking havoc.In a past life the ""Goosebumps"" adaptation was attached to Tim Burton and while that has long since ceased to be a fate you wish on a screenplay without reservations a certain lunacy and excess are missing from much of Mr. Lettermans realization. Not that there arent at least a couple of swell set pieces that go beyond frenzy Zack and Hannahs enchanting ride on a Ferris wheel in a forest before the onslaught has begun and the kids slippery face-off with the Snowman in the center of an ice rink straight out of some sweat-stained nightmare.But more often than not Mr. Letterman uses his movie as a toy chest of characters more than as a medium the muggy Mr. Black included. Ms. Rush has an easy warmth though its hard for anyone to stand out and a plot twist renders her character somewhat problematic as a strong heroine. Still ""Goosebumps"" would seem to yield the serial pleasures a voracious Stineophile might desire.

One alien on a single spaceship is a horror story but a thousand aliens in a colony is almost necessarily an action pic. So while any single monster from R. L. Stines series of young adult horror novels may have been enough to make kids leave the hall light on the release of all those monsters at once is much more spectacle than scare. (Hey a giant praying mantis Hey a werewolf Hey a malevolent talking dummy Etc.) Maybe its for the best; maybe a truly scary story would have alienated the target demographic or their parents. But weirdly the heart-stopping moments are replaced with the heart-throbbing variety as a newly arrived teen (Dylan Minnette) falls for a girl (Odeya Rush) whos like something out of a storybook. Rob Letterman (Monsters vs. Aliens) directs and Jack Black goofs his way through as the famous author. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Stine in ""Goosebumps"" adapted from the childrens book series. (HOPPER STONE)By Molly Eichel Inquirer Staff WriterPosted October 17 2015Goosebumps is a movie oddly targeted at two very different demographics. The first target is kids hence the PG rating. The second is millennials in the 25-35 age range who grew up with the source material the series of books written by R.L. Stine. The books had titles like The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena and Go Eat Worms and featured affable lead characters who experienced just enough scares to satisfy the elementary-school set.To satisfy both concerns Darren Lemkes script goes meta Instead of bringing one of the stories to the page (that has been done before namely on TV) Goosebumps makes Stine a character played by Jack Black who is tasked with fighting off the monsters he has created. Its a clever take on encompassing the entire Goosebumps brand within one movie rather than attempting to stretch one of Stines relatively short stories into a full-length movie.As someone who grew up with the Goosebumps novels as a constant on my childhood bedside table ( Night of the Living Dummy was clearly the best) I can say Goosebumps should work well with both demographics.Zach ( Scandals Dylan Minnette) moves to a new town and meets Hannah (Odeya Rush The Giver) the mysterious girl next door whose ultrastrict dad - that would be Stine - wont let her see Zach despite their raging teenage hormones. Hes doing this partly because hidden away in the Stine manse is all of the monsters Stine has ever thought up imprisoned inside padlocked books.Chaos ensues when Zach and his buddy Champ ( Trophy Wifes Ryan Lee) break into the house to save Hannah. Slappy (also voiced by Black) the evil ventriloquists prop from Night of the Living Dummy breaks out freeing the other monsters from their literary tombs.Black is in full-on camp mode which can be terribly annoying (think more Nacho Libre less Bernie) but hes also acting in the milieu of a kids movie and hes endearing as Stine-as-shut-in reveling in the metaness of his part. But its Lee as Champ playing the perfect awkward-best-friend foil to the everyman hero Zach who is the true standout.Will Goosebumps work for those who arent in the PG demographic or have no nostalgic longing for childrens books of their youths? It probably will not be the first thing on their must-see lists. But Goosebumps fulfills its purpose and thats what matters.meichelphillynews.com215-854-5909mollyeichel Goosebumps  (Out of four stars) Directed by Rob Letterman.

Stine Jack Black brings Goosebumps to hilarious hair-raising life With Jack Black in tow ""Goosebumps"" cleverly trumps its source material.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune October 16 2015 -- 818am Columbia Pictures Jack Black Odeya Rush and Dylan Minnette in ""Goosebumps."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint A tongue-in-cheek love note to spook stories of yesteryear ""Goosebumps"" is a kid-friendly crowd pleaser adults can love too. It reworks R.L. Stines scary novelettes into a wildly clever fusion of yuks and yikes. Reading Stine time after time to my kids I thought his stories were rudimentary formulaic time-fillers. Really a vampire poodle? Reinventing the tales on-screen makes all the difference. Digging into Stines 100-odd yarns with an anarchic sense of fun adding a charming cast and building an entire domain of monsters and mummies and skeletons with its own cultures and rules all make ""Goosebumps"" a demented frolic. We begin in suburban purgatory as teenage Zach (the winning Dylan Minnette) and his high school assistant principal mother (ever-hilarious Amy Ryan) settle in after moving from New York City. Looking at pleasantly dull Madison Del. Zach considers his life over. The only new classmate who wants to be his friend is a dweeb clumsily named Champ (Ryan Lee from J.J. Abrams fine ""Super 8""). Luckily just across the neighbors fence lives the rather great Hannah (Odeya Rush) a home schooler with girlfriend potential. Unluckily her father is there poking his angry face between the fences slats like Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining."" It gets worse. Hannah inexplicably disappears after a loud argument with her dad Zach peeping at their quarrel from his bedroom in classic ""Rear Window"" style. Maybe its not his life thats over. Thats just the setup for a continually clever framework of surprises beginning with the identity of that nasty man next door. He is no one other than bestselling author R.L. Stine played with peevish gusto by Jack Black. He is an antisocial curmudgeon whose library of old sealed manuscripts is about to unleash a battalion of monstrosities wreaking havoc on the city. Lets give away no surprises but just say that ""Goosebumps"" is a delightful exception to the view that the source material always tops the film version. Goosebumps 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG for scary and intense creature action and images and for some rude humor. The story becomes a never-ending battle against nasty garden gnomes carnivorous Venus flytraps and horrid aliens with freeze rays. They trample across the towns ultra-amateur police squad and head toward the unsuspecting kids holding that evenings high school prom bludgeoning every human they encounter with comic enthusiasm. The ringleader of the assault is none other than Slappy the ventriloquists puppet from ""Night of the Living Dummy."" That is Blacks vocal secondary lead role making each one sound like a twisted echo of the other. Slappy is aiming for revenge against his creator sarcastically calling Stine ""Daddy"" and warning ""Dont call me dummy"" Written with tongue-in-cheek genius by Mike White who also scripted Blacks sublime sugar rush ""School of Rock"" there are countless forms of family conflict among the various characters here each slice uproarious. The film takes high-level inspiration from a grab bag of bookstore detritus reworking Stines boogeymen just as he revised them from antique campfire stories. Every battle follows a unique plan as Stine and his three young helpers strategize how to beat their supernatural foes. When a giant yeti chases you into the ice rink you jump on the Zamboni and race away right? Wait its not fast. Even physical comedy packed with inventive computer animation and sharp editing needs some time out. ""Goosebumps"" zigzags into unexpectedly sharp pop-culture humor with fine gags about Stines writers vanity and his feud with book-selling rival Stephen King. While dreadful things happen to many characters no one seems to be badly hurt with the possible exception of Stines ego. I think he can bear it. If Stine were not one of the worlds most popular childrens authors this wild delight would push him there. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Goosebumps review More slapstick than scary - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Goosebumps review More slapstick than scary Dylan Minnette; Jack Black; Odeya Rush; Ryan Lee Hopper Stone SMPSP / Sony Pictures Odeya Rush from left Jack Black Ryan Lee and Dylan Minnette star in ""Goosebumps"" based on the novels of R.L. Stine. Odeya Rush from left Jack Black Ryan Lee and Dylan Minnette star in ""Goosebumps"" based on the novels of R.L. Stine. (Hopper Stone SMPSP / Sony Pictures) Katie Walsh Tribune Newspapers ""Goosebumps"" is spooky good. Silly spooky monster mash-up ""Goosebumps"" doesnt have to be as good as it is. Slyly smarter and more entertaining than it appears adults might have just as much fun as the kids who will undoubtedly gobble up this Halloween treat. A sort of PG version of ""Cabin in the Woods"" this adaptation of R.L. Stines series of young adult horror novels is bolstered by a stellar comedic cast headed up by the inimitable Jack Black in the role of the author.With so many ""Goosebumps"" books to choose from story writers Larry Karaszewski and Scott Alexander (with screenplay by Darren Lemke) chose to reverse engineer all of the titles into one film with author Stine as a main character. The result is a clever meta take on monster tales and what purpose they can serve for the writer. New kid in town Zach (Dylan Minnette) befriends his beguiling next door neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush) despite the disapproval of her intimidating dad (Black). When he suspects Hannahs in danger and the bumbling local police cant help Zach breaks into her house with his delightfully goofy friend Champ (the excellent Ryan Lee). Inside the creepy mansion Zach and Champ discover a stash of ""Goosebumps"" manuscripts that when unlocked release the monsters from the pages and into the world. Turns out Hannahs dad is one Mr. R.L. Stine who took his own personal demons and put them on the page before they eventually became real.And so begins the wild goose chase through the tiny town of Madison Del. as Zach Hannah Champ and R.L. Stine attempt to stuff the rampaging monsters back into the books. This is complicated by the leadership of revenge-happy villainous ventriloquist dummy Slappy who doesnt appreciate being locked up on the bookshelf. The script is funny and sharp and filled with references that most older horror fans will appreciate from ""Teen Wolf"" to ""The Shining"" but the film errs more on the side of slapstick than scary. A murderers row of comic talent backs up Black who in his scenery chewing best sets the tone and the standard for the rest. ""Workaholics"" star Jillian Bell is a hilarious stand-out as Zachs kooky aunt and comics such as Ken Marino and ""Veep"" player Timothy Simons pepper the supporting roles.The effects are sometimes cheesy especially the ones that are overly computer-generated while the sweetly low-tech practical effects for the mummies zombies and scary clown are a hoot. Some of the resolutions are a bit too neat and facile but ""Goosebumps"" is chockablock with humor heart and whole lot of fun thanks mostly to the committed cast who are game for anything. ""Goosebumps"" is a fun nostalgic popcorn flick that reminds us that monsters can still be childs play. Goosebumps (Trailer) Trailer for Goosebumps. Oct. 15 2015. (ScreenPlay) Trailer for Goosebumps.

Stine knows why kids like to be scared Goosebumps novels adapted for the theatre Goosebumps tops The Martian at box office while Crimson Peak falls flat Goosebumps the live-action movie is both fun and funny. For readers of Goosebumps R.L. Stines bestselling series of childrens horror stories it could even rate as a kids classic. For the rest of us it is an interesting and sometimes crazy way to bring Stines world to the screen. After 20 years of failing to figure out how to capitalize on any one of Stines books Hollywood finally decided to make the author an actual character (played by Jack Black) give him a teenage daughter (Odeya Rush) introduce a teenage boy-next-door (Dylan Minnette) and bring to life dozens of Stines books at the same time. The ruse in director Rob Lettermans film -- with Letterman working from a screenplay and story credited to Darren Lemke Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski -- is that the monsters from Stines imagination are actually locked inside the original manuscripts he created. When the boy-next-door accidentally opens one of the books and the monster starts to manifest itself things begin to go nutzoid in a small American town in Maryland. As Stine himself has pointed out his onscreen self is completely fictional and shares nothing with the real author. No matter Goosebumps is not a biopic. Instead it is a fantasy a horror movie and a comic adventure. Blacks exuberant performance as the movie Stine is absolutely hilarious. So are many of the special effects-driven monster scenes. That is not to say that Goosebumps the movie is really a kids classic. Not on the level of The Goonies or Gremlins or Back to the Future or other teen adventures. There are some prolonged action scenes that are repetitive and overblown especially those set at the high school. So the wild energy in Goosebumps seems to flag at crucial crossroads in the plotting. On the up side the teen acting corps in support of Blacks performance as Stine is a winning group. I especially admire how Minnette gives the boy-next-door some real depth while Ryan Lee is good comic relief as his best friend Champ. This Goosebumps ride may be bumpy but it works and it is worthwhile.

Close Join the conversation... On Facebook On Twitter With Britton Peele Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh There was a lot that could have gone wrong in adapting Goosebumps to the big screen.A Goosebumps movie needs to appeal to the nostalgia of 90s kids (a powerful force let me tell you) yet pull in younger viewers who may never have read a Goosebumps book. It needs to be scary but not horrifying enough to scar kids for life. It needs to be fun and self-aware without being too cheesy. And it needs to cram in as many classic Goosebumps monsters as possible from more than 60 books not including various spin-offs without losing focus on the smaller ensemble of characters that really matters.Somehow Goosebumps pulls it off. Viewer beware youre in for a scare. It begins simply and familiarly enough. After moving to a new small town with his mom likable teenager Zach (Dylan Minnette) just happens to bump into his cute neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush). But because theyre teens and love can never be simple Hannahs father (Jack Black playing a caricature of real-life Goosebumps author R.L. Stine) warns him to stay away lest bad things happen.So of course he doesnt stay away and bad things do in fact happen. Ryan Lee Dylan Minnette Odeya Rush and Jack Black in ""Goosebumps."" Hopper Stone/TNS Thinking Hannah is in trouble Zach enlists the help of the dorky but lovable Champ (Ryan Lee). The two boys sneak into Hannahs house in an attempt to rescue her but instead find shelves full of locked Goosebumps manuscripts. One of these books gets well ""accidentally"" unlocked setting loose a classic series monster The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena.Hijinks ensue more books are unlocked and the audience is soon on a roller-coaster ride full of ghouls ghosts and gnomes. However none of the monsters feel quite as dangerous as Slappy the ventriloquist doll from Night of the Living Dummy who serves as a sort of villainous mastermind.Slappy like many of the creatures that haunt Goosebumps kept a lot of children up at night after reading the best-selling books. The movie version is the same and while it wont frighten most older viewers especially those who have since graduated to more traditional horror movies Goosebumps might give the youngest children in its audience nightmares. It is however the sort of kid-friendly horror that will have most kids begging for more even as they hide under the covers. Dont worry. There are laughs and lights at the end of the tunnels.Goosebumps also knows exactly when to take a traditional horror trope and tone it down making it scary but not too scary. A typical horror movie would have its characters find blood dripping from the ceiling only to look up and see a monster or mangled corpse waiting for them. How do you make that kid-friendly? Turn the blood into candy from a broken vending machine.The CG-heavy action is reminiscent of another film that resonates with children of the 90s Jumanji. Like that movie the seemingly quiet town in which the movie is set gets torn to shreds by increasingly ridiculous circumstances with the end goal for our heroes being ""suck all these monsters back into the thing they came from."" There it was a board game. Here its books. The self-referential nature of Goosebumps story is what makes this movie more than a simple monster movie. This isnt a story about werewolves and zombies. Its a story about stories. GOOSEBUMPS (B)Directed by Rob Letterman. PG (scary and intense creature action and images and some rude humor). 103 mins. In wide release. Goes Well With...

Stine (Jack Black) right in ""Goosebumps."" (Hopper Stone SMPSP/Sony Pictures Entertainment) By Stephanie Merry October 15 2015 Follow stephmerry Whats creepier than a clown? A sinister ventriloquists dummy with an evil mind of its own for one thing. In the family-friendly ""Goosebumps"" you get both -- along with a giant angry praying mantis an army of malevolent garden gnomes zombies a levitating poodle a werewolf and an abominable snowman. Thats a recipe for nonstop CGI action but not much else. Based on the series of childrens horror stories by R.L. Stine  the big-screen adaptation of ""Goosebumps"" has been a long time coming. Since 1998 a series of writers and directors have tried to make this movie and screenwriter Darren Lemke (""Jack the Giant Slayer"") and director Rob Letterman (""Gullivers Travels"") finally made it happen. Stine is an outrageously prolific writer and his 300-plus published titles -- including ""It Came From Beneath the Sink"" and ""Say Cheese and Die"" -- tend to be short and formulaic A kid usually a recent transplant is confronted by some spooky strangeness and has to use his or her ingenuity to secure a happily-ever-after (or at least a bizarre-twist) ending. In the movie the new guy is sarcastic teen Zach (Dylan Minnette) who has just moved to Madison Del. from New York after the death of his father. The spooky strangeness starts in the house next door home to the lovely funny Hannah (Odeya Rush) and her weirdo dad (Jack Black) who greets his new neighbor by saying ""You see that fence? Stay on your side of it"" Nice guy. Dad happens to be none other than R.L. Stine himself -- or at least a Jack Black-ified version of the writer whose terrifying creations are so vivid that theyve come to life although they remain imprisoned inside locked manuscripts. Until now. When Zach and his new friend Champ (Ryan Lee) the dorky toothy epitome of adolescence sneak into the writers house they unlock one of the books and out pops the Abominable Snowman looking like an albino villain from ""Planet of the Apes."" The kids manage to suck the yeti back into his literary cage but while theyre busy other monsters get out and start a mutiny freeing all of the creatures. Suddenly the small town is inundated by potentially deadly supernatural beasts. This being a ""Goosebumps"" adaptation no one is ever truly in danger of dying. The movie is little more than a parade of chase scenes. The praying mantis hunts Stine and the kids until they find refuge in a supermarket where the werewolf terrorizes them until they escape to a cemetery where the zombies appear. Its occasionally funny and sometimes suspenseful but it isnt particularly imaginative. Then again neither are Stines popular novellas. ""Goosebumps"" is capably acted by its trio of teens and Black as always supplies some laughs with his acrobatic eyebrows. But the laughs give us only small respites from the endless action which looks so obviously computer-generated. The production values are better suited for a television movie and the music by Danny Elfman is distractingly intrusive. When Zach and his mother (Amy Ryan) first move to the suburbs and she remarks on how delightfully silent their new home is it seems like an odd time to have the score cluttering the very stillness shes remarking on. But so it goes with a movie that puts a lot more thought into the chase than on the people running. PG. At area theaters. Contains fantasy action scary images and some crude humor. 103 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Share Tweet ""Those arent kids books"" a character insists early into Goosebumps after his new companion shrugs off the YA source material of the film itself. ""Those are the books that keep you up at night."" Anyone who cut their teeth on R.L. Stines hit series--a long run of paperback novellas released at a monthly clip for the better part of the 90s--can surely recall at least a few endless evenings spent under the covers flipping pages by flashlight. But it wasnt really raw terror that kept fans awake past their bedtime; the average Goosebumps book wasnt so much frightening as powerfully addictive. They boasted tantalizing titles like Monster Blood and The Haunted Mask colorful covers that teased the mild horrors within and short plainly written chapters each punctuated by a cliffhanger. A whole generation of early readers--this writer included--lost sleep binging on regular installments. We couldnt wait to get to the end and then to crack the spine of the next one.Though it revives at least a dozen of Stines most popular beasts and fiends the new Goosebumps movie rarely recalls the old preteen page-turners for which its named; millennials seeking a nostalgia trip would be better off scouring their parents basement for Stay Out Of The Basement or at least cueing up an episode of the four-season Fox television series. This here is Goosebumps for todays kids meaning that the comparably quaint campfire tales Stine produced in bulk have been given a modern makeover--which is say theyve been replaced by the kind of noisy frenetic amusement-park ride that now passes for all-ages entertainment. The model is Night At The Museum not Night Of The Living Dummy.The film certainly begins like a Goosebumps book with teenage reader/viewer surrogate Zach (Dylan Minnette) moving with his widowed mother (Amy Ryan) to Madison Delaware a peacefully picturesque community just begging to be set ablaze by alien invaders or swallowed whole by a gelatinous blob. The girl next door Hannah (Odeya Rush) has a creepy father (Jack Black) who steals suspicious glances out of his venetian blinds and warns Zach to keep a safe distance from his daughter. Whats the cranky recluse hiding? Just as Goosebumps is hitting its Scholastic stride things take a turn for Jumanji territory Turns out Zachs mysterious neighbor is none other than... beloved literary genius R.L. Stine guardian of a Pandoras library of original manuscripts. Once unlocked his books unleash scores of monsters on the sleepy town.Goosebumps in other words takes place in a world where the Goosebumps series exists. Its a cute idea that the movie mostly employs as an excuse to turn Stines greatest hits--a lumbering yeti a mischievously invisible boy an army of lawn gnomes wreaking havoc in a kitchen (a la the gremlins of Gremlins)--into a string of CGI attractions going ""boo"" and then going away. Its all very carnival funhouse as director Rob Letterman (Gullivers Travels) rushes from one slapstick PG-rated chase scene to the next pausing occasionally for a laugh line by comic-relief ringers like Ken Marino and Timothy Simons.The films stabs at meta humor are more entertaining with Stine written as an eccentric wordsmith who hates being compared to Stephen King routinely forgets the plots of the books hes churned out and eventually explains that every story contains three parts ""the beginning the middle and the twist."" (Only these offhand gags remind a viewer that the authors of the films story Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski wrote not just Agent Cody Banks and That Darn Cat but also Ed Wood.) Meanwhile Jack Black plays Stine as well a Jack Black character throwing temper tantrums with a Tenacious D accent. He also does a halfway decent Cryptkeeper imitation to voice malevolent marionette Slappy who the film conceives of as Stines raging id pulling the strings on the whole monster mash.Again none of this bears much resemblance to the authors line of kid-centric potboilers which seem like models of classic suspense compared to the blockbuster hijinks on display here. Squint hard enough and it is possible to see the phantom impression of an Amblin entertainment especially given the Spielbergian dead-daddy backstory Zachs provided. But drawing that parallel only underlines how sanitized how danger-free family films have gotten in the two decades since Stines bestselling heyday. (Its the type of movie that insists on showing us that the high-school bully definitely survived his run-in with a giant praying mantis lest anyone assume that even a single soul perished in the supernatural rampage.) As effects-heavy time-wasters go Goosebumps is mostly harmless even sporadically amusing. But it isnt likely to keep anyone up at night out of fear or excitement.

In movies its really sort of the opposite. Its actually sometimes easier seeing a film to see where it went wrong. Why did the studio insist on doing this as a PG-13? Whose bright idea was it to cast Adam Sandler? Often figuring out where it first went seriously right though is a harder task. With ""Goosebumps"" though I think the first success was getting an original story by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Theyre the offbeat screenwriting team that over the years has given us everything from ""Ed Wood"" to ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"" and while some of those projects went awry - I was not the big fan of ""Big Eyes"" I wanted to be - the trouble was never in their concepts. And their concept for ""Goosebumps"" is a smart one. How do you make a movie about an entire library full of YA horror books? By writing a story about an entire library full of YA horror books coming to life - and their real-life author R.L. Stine trying desperately to round his characters up and get them safely back between covers before they destroy everything.As story gimmicks go that ones scary good. Alexander and Karaszewski just did the story though; after them it became a screenplay by Darren Lemke directed by Rob Letterman and frankly a few problems popped up mostly with tone. Yes this is a horror comedy. No no actor should ever be playing it as if they knew it were a comedy. That advice is lost on a number of the supporting actors and especially on star Jack Black. Black (who was also in Lettermans awful ""Gullivers Travels"") plays this fictionalized version of Stine (who himself gets a quick cameo at the end) and he spends most of the movie snacking noisily on the scenery. Of course this is Black through and through - an old-style entertainer who craves your affection or at least attention. But someone needed to get him to rail in the manic eyebrows and the prissy diction. The more seriously he took this the funnier it would be. But the two young leads - Dylan Minnette who is our hero and Odeya Rush who looks a little like a baby Mila Kunis and is our heroine - are appealing without being cutesy or smart-alecky. And the pace is great with the last hour being an all-out monster attack as all of Stines creatures - a werewolf zombies a mummy murderous garden trolls and a particularly sarcastic ventriloquists dummy - go on the rampage. A word to parents though. Despite the PG rating this is not a movie for the very small. Although theres no gore theres plenty of peril and even if Black is having a giggle these fiends are playing it straight - especially those undead creatures who crawl out of the graveyard at night. If you take a little one expect them to have some unpleasant dreams. And dont blame me if you join them. Ratings note The film contains scary monsters and a few shocks. Goosebumps (PG) Sony (103 min.) Directed by Rob Letterman. With Jack Black. Now playing in New Jersey/York.    Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com.

"Goosebumps a monster movie page turner review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGoosebumps a monster movie page turner review R.L. Stines beloved scary-funny Goosebumps books get their own movie and its a case of a bit too much of a good thing.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Oct. 15 2015GoosebumpsStarring Jack Black Amy Ryan Odeya Rush Dylan Minnette Ryan Lee and Jillian Bell. Directed by Rob Letterman. 103 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGTalk about having an overactive imagination.The onslaught of monsters ghouls and oddball baddies from two dozen of R.L. Stines massive crop of beloved kids books leap from page to movie screen for the first time freed by curiosity and a lot of CGI wizardry.Article Continued BelowGoosebumps the movie prompts more laughs than shrieks in this horror-with-training-wheels flick that reaches out to kid fans and those who long ago put Toy-Terror Batteries Included and A Shocker on Shock Street back on the shelf.Left to right Odeya Rush Ryan Lee Dylan Minnette and Jack Black star in Columbia Pictures Goosebumps. L-r Odeya Rush Ryan Lee Dylan Minnette and Jack Black star in Columbia Pictures ""Goosebumps."" Uploaded by Linda Barnard  (Hopper Stone)  With an opening aping a typical Stine story teen Zach Cooper (Dylan Minnette) isnt happy about moving from New York to a small town with his mom (Amy Ryan deserving better) when she takes a job as high school vice-principal. But things seem to be looking up when he meets Hannah (Odeya Rush) the confident and cute girl next door.But whats with Hannahs grouchy reclusive dad? It turns out the grumpus (Jack Black with arch mock-seriousness) is author R.L. Stine. And he has a few secrets to keep.Zach wont be put off when Stine rudely shoos him away from Hannah especially when he witnesses some weird goings-on one night that compel him and new chicken-hearted pal Champ (a very funny Ryan Lee) to sneak into the Stine house to snoop. The discovery of a roomful of Goosebumps manuscripts the covers strangely locked tempts Champ and before you can say ""big chill"" the massive star of The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena grows from the page and sets off on a rampage.More books flip open freeing the titular monsters Stine has invented and kept locked away. Slappy the Dummy the creepiest character of the bunch (and Stines alter ego voiced by Black) acts as power-mad ringleader.Director Rob Letterman (Monsters vs. Aliens Gullivers Travels) clearly had a Gremlins poster on his bedroom (or dorm room) wall. Grinning garden gnomes move from kitchen mayhem to terrorizing the town joined by a vampire poodle ghouls the Bog Monster and a massive praying mantis while Stine and his teen sidekicks team up to corral the ever-expanding pack of freed creatures to stuff them back between the covers.Jillian Bells brief scenes as Zachs Bedazzling-obsessed singleton aunt are fun. So is Darren Lemkes solid script which leans heavily on groaners and bad jokes to balance scares. The kids are good but Blacks hammy style coupled with frantic pacing and overstuffed monster mash-up makes a fun ride start to feel exhausting making The End a welcome Goosebumps page.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Sony Pictures Lively Goosebumps movie entertains then loses its way 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Childrens literature author R.L. Stine has to be thrilled by his treatment in the new ""Goosebumps"" movie. Even Spielbergs biopic about Lincoln may have fallen short of the detailed research that went into this tribute to Stine and his books about ghouls werewolves and a ventriloquist dummy. But the good intentions and faithfulness to the spirit of the author come at the expense of some important filmmaking things such as pacing and character development. Although its a fitting big-screen adaptation of a much-read childrens series the pleasures diminish if you havent read ""The Blob That Ate Everyone"" ""Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes"" and ""The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena."" ""Goosebumps"" gets off to a solid start with a lively Danny Elfman score and a buoyant script. Amy Ryan and Dylan Minnette are introduced as vice principal and mother Gale Cooper and high schooler Zach starting at a new school in a small Delaware town. You can often tell the quality of a movie about teens by how the parents are written and the banter between Ryan and Minnette is pleasant light on angst and fun. Jack Black is all paranoid bluster as Stine the author living in seclusion next door with his homeschooled daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush). Hes an angry crank with a secret -- his ""Goosebumps"" books when opened come to life. This is where the movie makes its first major misstep. Zachs ineptitude after an escalating series of misunderstandings is directly responsible for the creatures from the books escaping from their literary cages. From the beginning its clear that in the best-case scenario the protagonist will be back to square one responsible for about 40 million (give or take) in property damage to the town. Rather than focus on one of Stines stories in the resulting disaster ""Goosebumps"" the movie tries to weave in all of them. Its a fun ride for the kids in the audience -- especially the ones who read the books -- but it comes at the expense of human interaction. As the evil clowns dudes with jack-o-lantern heads giant killer bugs smaller killer bugs and aliens with freeze rays multiply they overwhelm everything else you were enjoying in the first half of the movie. Happily the filmmakers build a reservoir of goodwill in the first hour. An inept policeman and his overzealous trainee (Timothy Simon and Amanda Lund) display excellent comic timing in a couple of scenes. An abandoned amusement park provides a charming backdrop for the first moments between Ryan and Hannah. And while Blacks kinetic personality seems a bit caged as Stine he gets to cut loose as the voice of ventriloquist dummy Slappy. A lot of the characters have good chemistry in this movie and that includes Jack Black with himself. One note for parents Although the films content falls squarely within the PG rating it provides about 20 percent more visual terror than youre probably expecting. Plus the presence of a scary clown should automatically trigger a special MPAA rating. (PG-C?) Take your 5-year-old knowing that he may be visiting your bed every night between now and Halloween.

"Review Goosebumps YA horrors are a screaming good time on screen - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Goosebumps kids horrors are a screaming good time on screen Review Goosebumps kids horrors are a screaming good time on screen Hopper Stone / Columbia Pictures Jack Black from left Odeya Rush and Dylan Minnette in ""Goosebumps."" Jack Black from left Odeya Rush and Dylan Minnette in ""Goosebumps."" (Hopper Stone / Columbia Pictures) Glenn WhippContact Reporter Prolific kids lit author R.L. Stine cranked out 62 titles in his original ""Goosebumps"" series selling some 400 million copies worldwide to young readers eager to delve into his kooky creepy horror before graduating to become regular viewers of ""The Walking Dead"" or ""American Horror Story.""The books have never gone away and now comes a movie version of ""Goosebumps"" a playful horror-adventure romp that succeeds in translating Stines tried-and-true formula -- ""twists and turns and frights ... and a little personal growth for our hero"" as this knowing adaptation explains -- to the screen. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;The films appearance coming a good generation after the series peaked in popularity might mystify its original group of readers -- Stine ended the series in 1997 -- who will probably find its gentle ""Jumanji""-like fantasy elements to be a bit tame or if theyre less forgiving lame. But in a time when the gap between now and nostalgia has been reduced from decades to decimal fractions older teens if theyre not careful might find much to enjoy here while sitting next to the movies targeted demo of tweens and their parents. ""Goosebumps"" begins with high school hunk Zach (Dylan Minnette) moving to a small Delaware town with his mother (Amy Ryan) shortly after the death of his father. (It wouldnt be a kids movie without a tragic loss-of-a-parent back story.) There isnt much doing around these parts which makes the discovery of sweet smart girl-next-door Hannah (Odeya Rush) feel huge. One problem Hannahs eccentric protective father (Jack Black) makes it very clear that Zach must stay far away (like Maryland far away) from his lovely daughter. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story The movie written by Darren Lemke with the top-flight team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski receiving a story credit takes a little time in establishing these characters laying the foundation for an emotional connection between its young characters that will pay off later. Before laying on the goose bumps theres even a lovely scene between Zach and Hannah at what has to be the most exquisite abandoned amusement park in the world the two teens sharing a magic hour moment atop a Ferris wheel in a forest.But die-hard ""Goosebumps"" fans shouldnt fear. The PG-rated scares come soon enough when its revealed that Hannahs father is none other than famous author R.L. Stine and that he has good reason for warning kids to get off his lawn. It turns out that Stines imagination is so potent that his books creatures will spring to life if any of his original manuscripts are opened. Thats why he keeps them all safely under lock and key ... for a while at least. These days studios are increasingly looking to turn popular young adult books into movies. Do fans rush to theaters or stay at home and tightly clutch their books? Take a look at 25 examples. By Tracy Brown Noelene Clark Christy Khoshaba and Jevon Phillips. Once Pandoras books are opened director Rob Letterman (""Monsters vs. Aliens"") keeps the tone pitched nicely between humor and light horror and hes helped by a well-chosen ensemble of supporting players that includes gifted comic actors Jillian Bell (""22 Jump Street"") and Timothy Simons (""Veep""). Young actor Ryan Lee a standout in ""Super 8"" and ABCs ""Trophy Wife"" steals nearly every scene playing Zachs self-appointed best friend a grade A scaredy-cat and priceless walk-through-a-graveyard wingman. The movie has plenty of the expected fun with its parade of B-movie VFX-created creatures -- a werewolf giant praying mantis and an army of angry garden gnomes among them -- but it also possesses a sly self-awareness with its inspired idea of making Stine himself a character in the movie. ""Goosebumps"" gets some great mileage from the meta conceit poking fun at Stines amazing productivity and popularity even when compared with the author that the movie refers to with a hilarious snide familiarity as ""Steve King."" I have no idea as to the extent of the actual Stines peculiarities but just going from his weird wonderful work every scene in the movie feels authentic compared with the version I carry of him in my head.Blacks comic timing makes all the send-ups sing. Few actors can play broad winking comedy and still bring home small subtle character beats the way he can. To put it another way Its not easy to sell a delicate scene of regret when there are ghouls bog monsters bug-eyed aliens toy robots and a homicidal ventriloquists dummy (superbly voiced by Black as something of Stines alter ego) bearing down on you.It doesnt work as the fictionalized Stine says in the film if it isnt a real ""Goosebumps"" story.

Photo Columbia Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Goosebumps Running time 103 minutes. Rated PG (mild scares rude humor). What everyone remembers about ""Gremlins"" is one of the wee beasties unfortunate encounter with the microwave. What everyone will remember about ""Goosebumps"" is . . . nothing. Except that it was kinda like ""Gremlins."" ""Gremlins"" wasnt even the best fantasy-horror-comedy released on June 8 1984 and yet it looks like a classic next to ""Goosebumps"" a special-effects extravaganza that skips over basics like coming up with an interesting origination myth for the creepy creatures who bring havoc to a sleepy suburb. Theyre the creations of fantasy author R.L. Stine (amusingly played by Jack Black in fussy-man mode). How did they get unleashed on the world? Well one day they just decided to come alive and escape from his books. To destroy them hell have to write another book in which theyre captured. The end. The Abominable Snowman scares three local kids played by Dylan Minnette Odeya Rush and Ryan Lee in ""Goosebumps.""Photo Columbia Pictures In the meantime a werewolf zombies etc. lumber around being easily outfoxed by Stine and three teens. There is a lot of sizzle in the animated effects but all that is pretty much irrelevant if you dont care about the characters in peril and I didnt. Dylan Minnette as the hunky new boy in town is so amazingly dull that he is actually a totally convincing teen while Ryan Lee as the school nerd is woefully unfunny. Only 18-year-old Odeya Rush as Hannah Stines daughter shows a little star power. Black makes the film more or less watchable by emphasizing the oddness of his character (""I rub myself with cilantro every morning"") and at least a few of the monsters are entertaining Slappy the ventriloquists dummy is mildly scary and not as wooden as Minnette. ""Goosebumps"" breathlessly throws in every random monster it can think of then runs them offstage before they have much effect. The zombies come and go in about 30 seconds and the werewolf runs off when the nerd bites him. If this movie had really wanted to scare us it should have reserved its villain slots for some truly unsettling characters like the cast of ""The View.""

Stine -- For a While Tuesday October 13 2015 at 730 a.m. By Alan Scherstuhl EXPAND A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Heres a scary story for you. Somewhere in Hollywood a cabal of producers are forever zombie-ing up the corpses of long-dead licensed properties ever hopeful that you will continue to throw your money at familiar trademarked characters even as they eat your brains. Sometimes when a silver moon shines just so upon the re-animators the results of such rites become about more than just rights -- the holders and beneficiaries thereof. Sometimes these Franken-movies -- assembled from the dead meat of the pop past and given life by reckless jolts of nostalgia -- lumber forth without being abominable. And in those rarest of cases something plumps up inside these stitched-together entertainments something we might call a soul.That should be good news right? Sure for now -- but that also guarantees theyll try again in the future.Film Details Goosebumps RatingPG GenreAction/Adventure Running Time103 min. More Info Trailer That brings us to Goosebumps Rob Lettermans bumptious comic celebration of the impossibly popular Nineties kiddo fright novels written by R.L. Stine also the mastermind behind the puppet TV show Eureekas Castle a host of film novelizations and find-your-fate adventure books and the long-gone Scholastic magazine Bananas. The filmmakers to their great credit spend more than half the running time bending their studio tentpole release to the spirit of Stine rather than cramming Goosebumps into their template. Even when going for scares Stines work has always been smart about its silly dumbness. Its sly self-aware jovial -- an adjective he appended to his name on the covers of books such as 101 School Cafeteria Jokes. The mans an industry with numbers on his side and by that I dont mean just the tens of millions sold. I once paged through those 101 lunch jokes at a thrift store and seriously a couple will make you laugh.So like a jovial E.L. James Stines somehow got a movie based on his bestsellers that often actually feels like his bestsellers. This Goosebumps at its best is the kind of savvy horror-adventure goof that twenty years from now will be ripe for its own rebooting. Like the books or like some childproofed version of the movies Joe Dante used to make the movie crams much of the creepshow history of the Fifties through the Eighties into an Acme-brand woodchipper and then blasts it all into your face.But before the mayhem -- which involves a hovering death poodle a car-spearing praying mantis and the best onscreen iteration yet of murderous garden gnomes -- Goosebumps is patient and witty in its setup even risking the odd moment of beauty. Dylan Minnette plays a high school hunk whose name kids will remember but you wont. Like so many protagonists in horror-flavored entertainment hes struggling through after the loss of a family member in this case his father. His mother (Amy Ryan) needing a change herself moves him to small-town Delaware where he is immediately smitten with teen neighbor Hannah (the compelling Odeya Rush) who peers creepily out from a darkened window. But shes quick and bright ribbing him for his Beadazzled ballcap.""This is a gift from my aunt"" explains an abashed Hunk Boy. She smiles and each word of her response seems to pearl up from her mouth before her mind can parse it surprising and amusing her ""Its actually a gift for me and everyone who gets to see you in it.""Letterman (Monsters vs. Aliens Gullivers Travels) allows most of his actors moments in which to find their pearls. (The supporting cast includes Timothy Simons Ken Marino and Jillian Bell.) Especially in its superior first hour Goosebumps has a loose comic rhythm at odds with what we see in effects-heavy would-be blockbuster junk like Pan. Jack Black quickly turns up as Hannahs mysterious father warning Hunk Boy never to come near his home or daughter but for once he resists going over the top at first playing the heavy and then -- in a meta twist that delighted me -- an amusingly vain artist.Im being vague here because Goosebumps boasts twists Im glad I had no idea about going in. Sadly though the revelation of the biggest and riskiest is the movies peak building to some uproarious mocking of Stine himself and too much of the movie that follows is given over to the usual CGI fantasy mishegoss running from Monster A running from Monster B hatching a plan thats just crazy enough to work if only the heroes can buy enough time. Only one of these set pieces has any teeth an extended kitchen attack from those gnomes that in its trapped-floor climax one-ups Gremlins its obvious inspiration all without edging out of a PG rating. (One nice touch The evil ventriloquists-dummy is an actual puppet not pixels.)Kids in the theater around me found more to relish than I did in the climactic tumult. But they seemed as absorbed and amused as I was by the opening reels the tingle of romance the mystery of Hannahs father and the vision of an abandoned amusement park in the woods near Hunk Boys home just the place for him to cozy up to Hannah on a viny Ferris wheel whose spokes and gondolas reach out just over the tree line. The hundreds of bulbs lining it still work of course and it glows in the high branches like the tree-cities of Endor. Both those kids and I understood that by movies end this fantastic contraption would be sent crashing through the forest but what a pleasant surprise that at first we and the characters got to linger there smitten and unhurried.Goosebumps Directed by Rob Letterman Sony Pictures Opens October 16 Directed by Rob Letterman.

Stine in new Goosebumps clip R.L. Stine talks Goosebumps movie and meeting Stephen King for the first time From afar Goosebumps could be misunderstood as a cynical nostalgia play. Every major corporation with a cache of beloved 90s intellectual property is currently finding a way to microwave and serve up anything that will harken back to the good old days of the (first?) Clinton administration without feeling the need to update or spin. In that regard the new film starring Jack Black Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush could have been the cinematic equivalent of a Buzzfeed-style ""Remember this thing?"" listicle but thanks to a quirky sense of humor some nicely off-kilter performances and genuine sweetness it is very much not that at all. The movie does however have to do some expository gymnastics to get to the good stuff. Zach (Minnette) is new in town and the only interesting thing about the place is his next-door neighbor and her eccentric overprotective father (Black) who happens to be the author of the Goosebumps books R.L. Stine. In the films version of reality the books exist as we know them but their writer has the ability to conjure his terrifying creations into the real world and trap them back inside the pages if ever they were to escape. (They do.) Its not the most natural of conceits but it does get things moving. The action is structured around a series of encounters with the books iconic monstrosities like the werewolf of Fever Swamp the giant praying mantis and Slappy the evil ventriloquists dummy (voiced by Black). The creatures are rendered in cheap-looking computer effects which may have been intentional in order to gently tamp down the realism and scare factor for the films younger targeted audience. To its credit the Goosebumps film doesnt forget that Stines books were supposed to frighten kids. Black turns in solid work here to balance out the equation using his signature exaggerated facial expressions and pronunciation to underline that everything on the screen--even the scares--is supposed to be fun. Helping him are the continuously hilarious and always underrated Jillian Bell and Veeps Timothy Simons who can both make even the dullest lines laugh-worthy. Nothing about Goosebumps is revolutionary--at a certain point you may realize that its as if Nickelodeon produced Cabin in the Woods--but its a never-boring trip to a world where stories and imagination are powerful tools that just might inspire kids to do the scariest thing of all pick up a book.

Stine in a silly rollicking adventure that doesnt take itself too seriously Childrens horror author R.L. Stine has sold 400 million books -- a fact dutifully recounted in ""Goosebumps"" the new comedy-adventure named after Stines 200-odd novella franchise. A few of the prolific writers standbys make the leap from page to screen the amiable sarcasm the dad-joke puns the mild frights and the cornball monsters. (Making a cameo is the villain of ""Goosebumps No. 28 The Cuckoo Clock of Doom."") But because most readers age out of the book series by the time they receive their elementary school diplomas director Rob Letterman (""Gullivers Travels"" ""Monsters vs. Aliens"") and writer Darren Lemke take inspiration not from the paperbacks themselves but from how readers who have since outgrown them remember Stein and his library staples. The authors reclusiveness becomes part of the storyline and the variable quality of his scares is fondly mocked Homicidal lawn gnomes and the Abominable Snowman of Pasadena anchor two set pieces. Also Read Jack Black Boy George Cover The Doors Classic Hello I Love You for Conan OBrien (Video) The rest is pure Hollywood gloss Hunky Zack (Dylan Minnette) moves to a new town where he the astoundingly beautiful girl next door (Odeya Rush) his dorky pal (Ryan Lee) and world-famous writer (and monster hunter) R.L. Stine (Jack Black) end up amid car chases explosions a hail of knives and a Ferris wheel rolling down a mountain. Its rather far from the largely psychological books but its hard to imagine that ""Goosebumps"" purists would mind because the movie mostly works. Goofily self-aware and wholesomely boisterous its a childrens picture whose sense of spooky fun readily diverts from its quibble-worthy messaging. Also Read Jack Black and James Marsden Answer Intimate Questions on WWHL (Video) Convinced that his persnickety new neighbor Mr. Shivers has harmed his teenage daughter Hannah Zack sneaks into the house next door to save her. There Zack and his friend Champ discover a shelf full of leather-bound Goosebumps manuscripts with locks on them. They open one out of curiosity -- who binds Goosebumps books in leather? -- and out pops the colossal Abominable Snowman annoyed that his head grazes the living-room ceiling. Exiting another tome is an embittered talking dummy (voiced by Black) whos determined to make Stine pay for keeping him locked in a hardback by releasing all the monsters in the Goosebumps series. Its a dopey premise and the backstory for Stines magical powers of creation is superfluous at best but it gives an excuse for the quartet to careen from one imaginatively plotted scrape to the next. The slightly irreverent take on the book series means that the grab-bag assortment of fiends is allowed to be wonderfully silly none more than the knife-throwing garden gnomes whose every cock of an evil eyebrow is accompanied by a creepy crunch of ceramic grinding against ceramic. Also Read Nacho Libres Jack Black Jared Hess Reunite for Buffalo Films-Produced Micronations Black is the casts only big name reprising his familiar but welcome role as a fussy dweeb this time with a (probably intentionally) wavering mid-Atlantic accent. Amy Ryan as Zacks mom is utterly wasted and Jillian Bell as his cat-lady aunt deserves better. A quick appearance by the real Stine is more groan-worthy than Stan Lees cameos in the Marvel movies. The script has as many plot holes as it does monsters and the resolution of a secret about Stines daughter feels like the wrong one in a movie that wants to recognize real tragedy in the world. Perhaps disappointingly to some the movie makes the barest gestures at being scary. But it offers something arguably better goosebumps of delight. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

TWITTER Jack Black plays R.L. Stine in this lively take on the hit YA horror-lite books. Keeping the creepy/kooky mix entertainingly intact Goosebumps translates R.L. Stines frighteningly successful young adult horror fiction series to the big screen with lively teen Ghostbusters-type results. Just like those 400 million books sold worldwide the movie version energetically directed by Rob Letterman has a tongue-in-cheek tone that undercuts the bone-rattling with a dose of funny bone-tickling. With a huggable cast headed by Jack Black and Dylan Minnette the romp marking Sonys second Halloween-keyed release this season following in the monster footsteps of Hotel Transylvania 2 should create a similar frisson (after getting a first look at the London Film Festival) among nostalgic Stine fans and first-timers. Read more  London Film Fest Full Lineup Includes Black Mass Bryan Cranstons Trumbo Not exactly thrilled about having to relocate from New York to small town Madison Delaware when his widowed mom (Amy Ryan) accepts a job as a high school vice principal teenager Zach Cooper (Minnette) perks up upon meeting perky next door neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush). That is until he discovers that her reclusive dad (Black) turns out to be none other than Stine himself and he promises to make Zachs life very unpleasant if he doesnt keep away from his daughter. Cutting to the chase Papa Stines warning proves prophetic when Zach finds out the hard way that the creatures in his books have a habit of coming to life if the original manuscripts containing them are unlocked. Cue the floodgates. When faced with which of Stines other-worldly characters to release from their leather-bound confines the filmmakers adopted a ""the more the merrier"" philosophy cramming in dozens of them led by Stines evil alter ego Slappy the Dummy. Although that choice means missing out on any sort of more inspired one-on-one interactions director Letterman (Monsters Vs. Aliens) choreographs the ensuing creature chaos with panache while still allowing the ample humor in Darren Lemkes script (from a story credited to Scott Alexander amp; Larry Karaszewski) to rise above the cacophony. While Black doesnt physically resemble the actual Robert Lawrence Stine he nevertheless creates an effectively droll character combining a pair of heavy-rimmed black glasses Orson Wells-type literate tones and a spiteful vanity that makes Stephen King the bane of his existence. Possessing a relatable likability Minnette and the fresh-faced Rush make sturdy foils for Black; while the preternaturally funny Jillian Bell mines some laugh-out-loud gems as Zachs wacky Aunt Lorraine.

Stines kid-lit franchise hits the big screen in a monster mishmash. Young audiences are in for an early lesson in disappointing cinematic literary adaptations with ""Goosebumps."" This first big-screen spin on R.L. Stines popular kid-lit series -- which already inspired four seasons of TV -- turns an endearing collection of silly spooky stories into a busy noisy soulless eyesore. Perfectly timed to capitalize on Halloween-happy family auds the lackluster horror-comedy will likely squander its breakout potential once word of mouth gets out. Instead of adapting any one or a select few of Stines 100-plus ""Goosebumps"" tales the filmmakers opt for a greatest-hits mishmash that prioritizes the spectacle of a parade of monsters over any attempt at atmosphere or mystery. The result is like gorging on trick-or-treat candy -- it may sound like a fun idea but youll pay for it later. Clean-cut teen protagonist Zach (Dylan Minnette) moves with his widowed mom (a grossly underused Amy Ryan) from New York to sleepy suburban Madison Del. Hoping for a fresh start in the wake of his fathers untimely death Zach finds an immediate distraction in the enigmatic girl next door Hannah (Odeya Rush) whose overprotective father (Jack Black) warns Zach in no uncertain terms to stay away. Thats especially hard to do when -- in a ""Rear Window"" homage -- Zach spies a father-daughter argument and Hannah disappears. Soon enough a meta twist reveals that Hannahs father is actually author R.L. Stine. He lives in seclusion to protect his original ""Goosebumps"" manuscripts which have the power to manifest the monsters described within when opened. Zach and his geeky pal Champ (Ryan Lee) discover that supernatural development firsthand when they accidentally unleash the ""Abominable Snowman of Pasadena"" while snooping around Stines house. During the ensuing chaos another creature comes to life maniacal ventriloquists dummy Slappy (voiced by Black) who proceeds to spread Stines manuscripts all over town and conjures everything from a wolfman to man-eating plants trigger-happy aliens with freeze rays and a vampire poodle. Director Rob Letterman (who previously collaborated with Black on ""Gullivers Travels"") stages a few reasonably well-crafted monster-specific setpieces including a snowman showdown in an ice rink and a gang of demonic garden gnomes invading a kitchen but for the most part ""Goosebumps"" rapidly devolves into a frantic roller-coaster ride with random creatures popping up at every turn. A list provided in the films production notes tallies 25 different spooks in all (and many of those like the aliens and gnomes appear in packs). The ADD overload combined with an understandably kid-friendly approach to horror (no ones ever in real danger and the monsters are never too scary) results in a disposable product intended to appeal to everyone but likely to resonate with no one. Performances are all over the map. Blacks hammy Orson Welles-inspired turn fails to add much humanity to the role of a haunted author. Best known for supporting work in film and TV Minnette adequately steps up to leading-man status though his character is far too bland to invite real rooting interest. Talented comedians Timothy Simons and Ken Marino are wasted in throwaway roles while Jillian Bell works overtime to steal her scenes as Zachs perpetually single Bedazzler-crazy aunt but thats petty theft at best. From a tech perspective ""Goosebumps"" is up to the current standards of broad family entertainment -- though its mix of CGI and practical effects to bring the monsters to life falls far too heavily on the cartoony CG side of the equation. Aside from Slappy a legit dummy puppeted by Avery Lee Jones the key baddies are predominantly visual effects. There was a time when Tim Burton -- who surely wouldve put a more distinctive stamp on things -- flirted with the project which likely explains why Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (""Ed Wood"" ""Big Eyes"") have story credit.

Okay ya says November 8 2015 at 826 am this is so not accurate I am 16 years old and I went to see this movie and I was completely entertained the entire time. it was funny and suspenseful and the parents and kids around me agreed. Its a childrens movie. do you expect it do be some sort of dramatic representation of our inner thoughts? no. it was just good cheesy suspenseful fun. Reply fu says November 1 2015 at 209 pm If thought it was good Reply Brady Nelson says October 23 2015 at 841 am My wife and I took our kids to this show and they each brought a friend. All 4 of them loved it. All of the critiques from this critic about the movie being to crazy loud and all over the map is what our kids liked most about it. My wife and I knew this show wasnt for us going in and judging by the critics photo and my assumed age for him it wasnt catered to him either. Lighten up. It was a great show for kids and families to go see together if you leave your salty ornery opinions at home. Reply CoJo says October 7 2015 at 1223 am Can people pleeeeeeease stop using ADHD as a generic criticism? Its demeaning. Its like calling something autistic. Reply John Joseph Donald Rivet says October 5 2015 at 1127 am I dont get why people are complaining for its Goosebumps. Were you honestly expecting something amazing? Sheesh. Reply reinaprincesa says October 5 2015 at 1057 am A Goosebumps movie where Jack Black plays R.L. Stine went off the rails from the series? A Shocker on Shock Street I work with kids and I have to explain what Goosebumps is and the kids who know something still say ""wait what was that dummys name again?"" I think the kids will be fine - unless you mean those bigger 20-30 something year-old kids in which case the disappointment may be strong. Reply John Joseph Donald Rivet says October 7 2015 at 1145 am Nobody is going to be disappointment because its exactly how the books were cheesy but fun. Reply Terry Tucker says October 14 2015 at 1115 am Agreed JJD I think the structure the screenwriters created sounds rich and inventive and I cant wait to see their work - not to mention Jack Blacks  - this weekend with a passel of nieces and nephews in tow. I.predict much bigger box office than the studio does. See All 8 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Jason Bourne Targets 60M+; Bad Moms Gets Sassy With 26.5M...
