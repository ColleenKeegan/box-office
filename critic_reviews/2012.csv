Yes 2012 is infantile. Yes it treats the deaths of six billion people as little more than a tragic footnote. Yes its about as interested in subtlety narrative invention or character development as the Corkscrew at Alton Towers.But what a ride. There are moments - sights sounds special effects - that have never been seen or imagined before sequences of staggering complexity immaculate detail and breathtaking scale. In summary it may seem like just another disaster movie but this one is bigger louder crazier and more wildly exhilarating than anything previously attempted even by  Roland Independence Day Emmerichs own smash n grab standards.The plot is little more than a framing device the MacGuffin something to do with sunspots plate tectonics and the Mayan calendar. The closest we have to a hero is John Cusacks shambolic failed author Jackson Curtis whose attempts to save his estranged family from a fiery death somehow involve Russian plutocrats Himalayan plane crashes and Woody Harrelson in a fez. But nobody goes to a movie like this for the storyline. This is disaster porn and unashamedly so pavements crack buildings topple crowds flee planes plummet and world leaders scramble to save their own skins as the planet goes to hell in a handcart.  Posterity will not be kind to 2012 - and it definitely wont work on DVD - but catch it on the biggest noisiest screen available and approach it on its own terms and itll knock your socks off.Read the directors guide the perfect disaster movie here By Tom Huddleston Posted Tuesday November 10 2009 Details Release details Rated 12A Release date Friday November 13 2009 Duration 158 mins Cast and crew Director Roland Emmerich Cast Woody HarrelsonJohn CusackAmanda PeetChiwetel Ejiofor Users say (54) 3 out of 5 stars Average User Rating3.3 / 5Rating Breakdown5 star244 star53 star42 star41 star17LiveReviews|541 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew ReviewsRefresh2 minutes agoJane G.TastemakerFeaturedI really love disaster movies Lots of action and adventure Kind of old now but I recently saw it again and loved it all over again.?Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 20 2013maheen khanFeatured2012 is an exellent movie i have ever seenHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 20 2013maheen khanFeatured2012 is an exellent movie i have ever seenHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 14 2013Andy SFeaturedAwful.

I was probably expecting too much though as I was looking forward to watching it and missed it when it was in the cinema. Weak and unbelievable story line with poorly developed characters but excellent special effects. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it better in the cinema?

Yawn.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 28 2009AngryFeaturedHORRIBLE CRAP CRAPPPPPPPHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 28 2009AngryFeaturedHORRIBLE CRAP CRAPPPPPPPHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 25 2009ColsterFeaturedLets jump on the last Ark to reality. The special effects are amazing on a big screen and that is the only positive. With the promise of seeing how the world copes with armageddon we actually get to see how a bunch of Americans cope. (Not sure why they get a ship to themselves when the whole of Africa or Australasia isnt fit enough to save). Those who have talked about suspending your disbelief and how original this film is need to step outside of the asylum every once in a while. The plot could not have been more predictable. Hands up if you thought Gordon would make it to the end of the film - no me neither and the mrs locking lips with another guy seconds after he got squished was unbelievable. The little ladys looking after the kids while us men save the world came straight out of the 1800s. Have we not grown out of the 5 minute speeches saying goodbye to your wife and building bridges with your kids when thousands of lives rest on your shoulders. And what has Roland Emmerich got against flying? As in Godzilla he chooses to use aircraft to dodge around and under things instead of going over them. I can only assume that a quality cast must have signed very solid contracts before reading the script. This looks great but I left the cinema feeling dirty.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 23 2009laurenFeaturedthe best bit is near the beginning when LA becomes a seething ocean of concrete falling buildings and crazy flying trains- awesome I couldnt stop laughing the chaos made me so happy. After that though? Its all a bit ho hum- mostly because the plot is so bad. One of the major dilemmas seems to be whether the people are going to be told the world is coming to an end.... well aside from causing even more chaos and mass panic by doing that.... I think the people might have already noticed... what with places like hawaii turning into a giant volcano and LA falling into the ocean... Something I found fascinating about this film was how few countries actually constituted the world basically if youre involved in the G8 you count..... dude. Dont even get me started on the get the guys up here and the guys better see this while the women sit uselessly reapplying their lipgloss. This film was mildly insulting and very rah rah America. Beyond that the first scenes of mega chaos just made me so happy Im giving it three stars just for that.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 22 2009KateFeaturedThe first half of this movie filled me with glee with all the crazy destruction - then I started to notice the completely rubbish plot and characters you dont care about. Aerial stunts by trains and african fauna are fabulous in many ways and and Woody Harrelsons turn as a beardy-weirdy still make this well worth a look though.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 21 2009KateFeaturedI like Kanes comment that you never know what is going to happen next I think it was pretty much the same story as The Day After Tomorrow except with heat rather than cold. I really had an enjoyable time watching it although the story is crap and the end lame and not one believable moment. The world ends and and nearly everyone dies but that isnt sad at all in this film. Its a real feel-good all American type family film. Death and destruction being a 12A? Its fun but pure fantasy and full of jokes. . Dont know what effects Roland Emmerich will come up with next hes done it all in this one.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 21 2009LawrenceFeaturedThe movie started slow nothing different form other disaster movies but it took a different turn when the supermaket split in half. I love the scene when the volcano errupted. Good special effects. it felt like I was there.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 21 2009ashleeFeaturedthe closing line of the movie is im not scared anymore daddy. no more pull-ups enough said.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 20 2009HerbdebopFeaturedStarts out impressively with great effects and tension but descends into a real turkey dinner with trimmings of scientific claptrap gallons of schmalz and hammy acting.

The CGI was like a cut scene from a Playstation game except the Tsunami scenes The acting was pants John and Woody can do alot better than this. The Day The Earth Stood Still wasnt much worse than this and that was worst movie of last year.

People actually walked out of final bit of film where I watched it. It was as much to keep from throwing up with every (american) cliche in the book including dialogue I thought meant a straight to DVD release. APS200m? What price a decent script?Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 14 2009flixFeaturedThe sun goes berserk and starts to heat up the earths mantle with mega bad results for the planet and all life - its planet warming time not global warming here. The wealthy and politicos prepare to save themselves whilst the rest of mankind is kept in ignorance. The city footage of skyscrapers collapsing together are awesome and theres enough character development to hold a modicum of human interest between the epic scenes of global damage. Great escapist fun and the movie house cheered when the fat iconic Russian billionaire took a no returns swan dive.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 14 2009anderlouFeaturedIf youre expecting a huge Hollywood disaster movie full of great special f/x thats what youll get. If youre expecting a quality drama with well-rounded characters and intelligent script youll be very disappointed. I knew what to expect and I loved it Daft but I was glued to my seat. And it borrowed my favourite ever movie line (from Jaws) and I thought the ending was rather neat if you think about where man came from in the first place.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/87927/2012.html,200,20120,2012,timeout

The unfortunate masses -- innocent as their four-legged fellow creatures but traditionally more expendable in disaster epics like this one -- die in ways it takes Armageddon-movie master Roland Emmerich and a mighty army of CG artists to devise. For starters Los Angeles cracks and falls into the sea Las Vegas crumbles Yellowstone National Park becomes a volcanic hellpit India is devoured by a tsunami and the Catholic faithful in Rome are buried under the rubble of their own magnificent church buildings. Cool Oh and also? A cruise ship on the high seas upends with a ? harrumphing glug-glug sinking to join its colleagues the Poseidon and the Titanic. God forgive me but I enjoyed the nerve-racking silliness of this newest loudest exercise in destruction. (And God help us all now more than ever I think cities could crumble and oceans could rise.) Emmerich is of course an old hand at bangs a manipulator who thinks whimpers are for sissies Aliens tore up the place in Independence Day an irradiated lizard stomped through Godzilla global warming ruined everyones plans in The Day After Tomorrow and you dont want to know all the troubles the prehistoric hero known as DLeh done seen in 10000 BC. This time as the story opens in 2009 the earths core is heating up and acting all wonky alarming an earnest U.S. government geologist (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He rushes to inform the White House chief of staff (Oliver Platt) who rushes to inform the President (Danny Glover) who eventually confides the news? to his tremulous daughter (Thandie Newton). Cut to three years later and a California Everyman named Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) picks up his cute son and daughter (Liam James and Morgan Lily) at the home of his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and her new guy (Tom McCarthy). Jackson takes the kids camping at Yellowstone where he meets a useful mountaintop crazyman (Woody Harrelson) who predicts the end of days. The good news Thanks to the crazyman when the end of days begins to make itself known the Curtis family (plus the ex-wifes new guy) are able to stay one step ahead of the abyss. This postnuclear clan has a terrific ability to drive on roads that cave in behind them and fly (in half-borrowed half-skyjacked airplanes) between toppling buildings bridges mountains and fireballs. Enthusiasts of websites involving the Mayans apocalyptic predictions are welcome to join enthusiasts of websites involving planetary instability to discuss the facts behind this chaotic fiction; biblical scholars are welcome to chime in on the meteorological conditions that coincided with the launch of Noahs Ark. Me Im more charmed by the now-classical way in which Emmerich uses scenes with human interest -- you know the introduction of a handful of characters we care about -- to offset the sense-battering showpiece action sequences. (Those are usually the ""feelings"" scenes in which we laugh with nervous relief at the familiarity of human puniness.) Just ask Steven Spielberg Theres nothing like imminent destruction on a world scale to make a father want to heal a broken family. Cusack with his one-of-the-guys face and his nice way with child actors does creditable work as an Average American Dad trying to put things right. Of course Emmerich (and his co-writer Harald Kloser who also ? co-scripted 10000 BC) is never one for subtlety. Average Dads homegrown virtues are ?contrasted with the thick-lipped fat-bellied crudity and obscene wealth of a Russian oligarch (Zlatko Buric) looking out for his own two young sons. Meanwhile as Commander-in-Chief (in the idealized mode of 24s President David Palmer) Danny Glover is a good father to the country and his own daughter; however we know his chief of staff is a cold SOB because hes distant from his aged mother. As for Ejiofors geologist he gets to tell his dad he loves him before the end draws nigh. Which in this rock-solid disaster-pic ? formula makes him the perfect character to deliver the climactic speech that unites mankind. Well its either him or the dog.

So sayeth the tag line for the latest from Roland Emmerich master of destruction. And you know what? We were Back with the first trailer in 2008 it was clear that 2012 was gunning for the title of most-massive-most-deaths-most-destruction-in-a-movie ever earthquakes fiery pits tidal waves that threaten the entire Eastern Seaboard and generally speaking the mother lode of apocalypse porn. And? The film so does not disappoint. Even if you take some parts from earlier end-of-days pics like (the awesome) Knowing or Mr. Emmerichs previous offerings The Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day you still wont be prepared for the sight of California sliding into the Pacific or a tidal wave-battleships included-washing over the White House. Every single audience member knows whats coming (and not because of any ancient Mayan prophecy) and so it all becomes a question of the when and the how and the how big can we go. The movie takes it sweet ole time setting up a backstory before the world goes boom. Theres John Cusack oddly ageless as a divorced dad who writes not-so-popular books like Farewell Atlantis (more on this later) and tries to impress his kids who live with his ex-wife Amanda Peet and her new husband (Tom McCarthy). Then theres the great Chiwetel Ejiofor (master geologist) and Thandie Newton (presidential daughter and museum expert); a semi-dastardly Oliver Platt (always so good); and Danny Glover who plays our president and always seems to be on the verge (either while about to be engulfed by an ash cloud or washed away by a tsunami) of saying ""Im too old for this shit."" Woody Harrelson looks to be having the time of his life playing a crazy (yet oddly accurate) coot who eats pickles and George Segal is a jazz man on a cruise ship who may or may not connect with his estranged son in Tokyo. And you know what? It doesnt matter We all know this movie is just killing time before killing everybody. Luckily the actors appear to be in on the joke (how else to explain Mr. Ejiofors dead-serious delivery about the merits of Farewell Atlantis which apparently will become one of the few tomes to make it into a brave new world). Theres a halfhearted attempt to send a message about humanity and always-respect-your-Mayans and etc. but mostly the audience howled with laughter at every solemn exchange. But happily 2012 is reminiscent of yesteryear 80s shlock-tastic blockbusters--total popcorn entertainment with ridiculous dialogue and impossible situations and special effects that will boggle the brain for a good two-plus hours. What does it mean that such blissful escapism comes at the hands of the apocalypse? (Cant pay your rent? It wont help when the sidewalk ends pal) When the credits finally rolled the crowd sat for a minute dazed. ""Holy crap"" the man said behind me. Indeed.

By Anthony Lane Penelope Cruz is seen entirely in flashback in Pedro Almodovars new movie.   Credit Illustration by Akiko Kato How many tales are told in the course of ""Broken Embraces"" the new film from Pedro Almodovar? People keep interrupting themselves or changing direction in order to embark upon a story. People that is like the screenwriter Harry Caine (Lluis Homar) and his assistant Diego (Tamar Novas) who cannot pass a row of posters marked with a red cross and the words ""Dona Sangre"" meaning ""Give Blood"" without starting to dream up a whole new plot about vampires working in a blood bank. Though that plot never comes to fruition we do watch Harry and Diego as they talk up its erotic potential--simultaneously aroused and amused like so many souls before them in the work of Almodovar. Harry too is a fiction of his own devising. ""I was always tempted by the thought of being someone else"" he admits in an opening voice-over. He used to be a film director named Mateo Blanco and now he is a screenwriter but clearly something more drastic than downsizing has occurred; it will take us the rest of the movie to discover what that was. He has also lost his sight although I confess to a glimmer of doubt. Given his talent for invention and the mileage that he gets from his disability in the first scene--a young woman who has helped him cross the road is invited back to his apartment there to be swiftly seduced--you cant help wondering for a while if there is more to his blindness than meets the eye. That is purest Almodovar his images remain as crisp as apples with the lines of walls and furniture not to mention bodies and the clothes that enfold them offered with such proud and bracing clarity that its difficult to realize--not until the movies aftermath perhaps--just how ambiguous the emotional life that surrounds them really is. His world is as hard to the touch as it is elusive to the understanding; there are motives that lurk and scurry behind those walls which we will never trap. Take Lena (Penelope Cruz) whom we see entirely in flashback though she fills the movie to the brim. In the nineteen-nineties she was first the secretary and then the mistress of Ernesto Martel (Jose Luis Gomez) a wealthy Madrid industrialist whose death is announced at the start. In life he was both devoutly pampering (we see Lena drape herself in gold with a necklace like a boxing champions belt) and rabidly jealous not an unusual combination. Lena weary of her gilded cage tried an acting career (was she too impelled by ""the thought of being someone else""?) and ended up in the office--then in the movie and soon in the arms--of Mateo Blanco. Martel needed no Iago to ignite his suspicions preferring to employ his gay son Ernesto Jr. (Ruben Ochandiano) to dog the secret lovers with a video camera and a lip-reader to decipher the results. To summarize each strand of ""Broken Embraces"" would take all night and you would still have to skip the numberless rhymes and references that entangle the film. Ernesto Jr. for example turns up in later life calling himself Ray X a mirror of the X-rays of Lenas bones when she takes a tumble downstairs. Meanwhile the color red emboldens Almodovar as it did Michael Powell and here its dazzle leaps from shoes to shirts to blood to a teardrop on the side of a tomato and even to a painted crucifix on the wall of Harrys home. Powells ""Peeping Tom"" receives a bow as Lena grabs a tripod and jabs it like a sword and homage is also paid to Rossellini Louis Malle and others--forerunners in that wry and mobile intensity sought by Almodovar. (As for the heros name think of Michael Caine playing Harry Palmer in ""The Ipcress File."") Nobody can quibble therefore with the patterning of intelligence in the film; to what however do these visual sums add up? If anything their complexity means that as a study of amour fou ""Broken Embraces"" is on the chilly side. There is plenty of sex on show--or better still not on show as two figures swathed in bedsheets roil and wrestle like a pair of randy ghosts--but none of it struck me as particularly fou and since Harrys rampancy was established at the beginning his love for Lena could be just another crush. Also Lluis Homars charm in the principal role is of the blockish unremarkable variety. Think back to the parts that Antonio Banderas in his taurine youth played for Almodovar and you feel tempted to ask whether over the years the director has consciously or otherwise drained some of the potency from his masculine leads the better to yield the spotlight to his ravishing muses. Cruz is certainly more worshipped than ever by his camera and you have to laugh when fresh from intercourse with mussed hair she stares at the bathroom mirror as bare as a baby and declares ""I look awful."" If you say so dear. Yet the film like Harry is so fixated on the perfection of her posing--on the iconography of the actress rather than on the layering of her character--that our sympathies strongly engaged at first blush somehow cool as the story proceeds. The multiple narratives thicken but you can feel the blood of the movie starting to thin and what may have been intended as a pulsing reanimation of ""Vertigo""--Harrys concluding task is to remold his desires into a finished work of art and Alberto Iglesiass music is in deep and breathless pursuit of Bernard Herrmann--seems a touch too long too airless and too content with its own contrivances to stir the heart. Almodovar is like his heroine armed with a tripod. He is a Tom who peeps and gazes but finally fails to strike home. The best thing about time is the nick of it. Such is the binding rule of melodrama which decrees that all escapes shall be narrow no more than the breadth of a hair to save oneself and others at ones leisure with room to spare would be an insult to the satisfaction of the moment. The rule was most famously observed by D. W. Griffith in 1920 when in ""Way Down East"" he had Richard Barthelmess pluck a supine Lillian Gish from a chunk of ice floe just before it reached the lip of a waterfall. The rhythm of the scene has never really been improved upon--Griffith even found space for some dreamy drifting closeups of Gish in her dead faint--and there are filmmakers working today who strive mightily to match him. Their leader is Roland Emmerich the director of ""Independence Day"" ""Godzilla"" and now ""2012"" and a firm believer in the closest possible shave. Thus in the new film Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) drives a limo containing his children his ex-wife and her boyfriend through the Los Angeles streets which are crazing and cracking behind him. And so to the airport where the boyfriend (Tom McCarthy) who is both a plastic surgeon (hiss) and a novice pilot (hurrah) jumps into a plane accelerates along the runway--which is also caving in--with all the gang on board and takes off by a whisker. Later he repeats the process as the co-pilot of a hulking Russian aircraft which just clears a devastated Las Vegas and then just lands safely in the snows of China--or at least allows Jackson to drive a Bentley out of the cargo hold before the plane tips into a crevasse. Just. By this stage as you might expect the law of diminishing returns is in full force. When Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum squeaked through a rapidly closing door in the side of a spaceship in ""Independence Day"" at least we got Smith yelling ""Elvis has left the building"" to signal his triumph and add some comic pep whereas the mood in ""2012"" veers between head-shaking doom and eye-moistening hopefulness with nothing in between. You want to grab the entire cast and say Come on guys its not the end of the world. Just because ""the biggest solar eruptions in human history"" have led to ""a new kind of nuclear particle"" at our planets core meaning that ""the Earths crust is destabilizing"" so what? Emmerichs people dont face apocalypse by getting drunk or having sex; they merely set about planning ""the most important schedule in the history of mankind"" which happens to be the most boring phrase in the history of American cinema. ""2012"" is so long and its special effects are at once so outrageous and so thunderously predictable that by the time I lurched from the theatre I felt that three years had actually passed and that the apocalypse was due any second. Emmerichs main achievement is to take a bunch of excellent actors including Danny Glover Thandie Newton Chiwetel Ejiofor and Woody Harrelson and to prevent all of them--with the exception of Oliver Platt and a pair of giraffes--from giving a decent performance. As for the statement issued by the governor of California in response to the catastrophe just block your ears. Obviously the producers couldnt hire the genuine article so instead they looked around and found the worlds worst Schwarzenegger impersonator thus adding to the general sense of gruesome make-believe. The President of the United States informs his fellow-leaders that ""the world as we know it will soon come to an end"" but its not the world we know. And there are still two and a half hours to go. Thats not soon enough.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

"Apocalypse wow Look dont listen - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-HousesApocalypse wow Look dont listenNovember 13 2009|KENNETH TURAN | FILM CRITIC As far as the new disaster film ""2012"" is concerned the world will end with both a bang and a whimper the bang of undeniably impressive special effects and the whimper of inept writing and characterization. You pays your money you takes your chances.In fact its hard to say what leaves the more lasting impression how realistically director Roland Emmerich has destroyed Los Angeles (its the third try after ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" practice apparently making perfect) or how difficult a time the actors have bringing any life to the script by Emmerich and Harald Kloser.Nothing not even a season of Shakespeare at Stratford-upon-Avon will give you more respect for how difficult it is to be an actor than watching top talent like John Cusack Chiwetel Ejiofor Amanda Peet and Oliver Platt struggling to treat the films ungodly language and situations with perfect seriousness.The deeper truth of course is that it doesnt really matter and everyone with a hand in ""2012"" knows as much. Audiences with a hankering for the apocalypse shrug off the ridiculous and sit tight for the special effects. In this case they are worth the wait.Overseen by visual effects supervisors Volker Engle and Marc Weigert ""2012s"" pyrotechnics are the best money a lot of money can buy. Just to give you a taste of how elaborate it all got more than 1000 people at 15 effects companies worked on this using 500000 tons of steel to construct platforms that realistically shook and building a blue screen that was more than 600 feet long and 40 feet high.Though this equal-opportunity endeavor ends up destroying a hefty chunk of the world -- St. Peters Basilica in Vatican City the Christ the Redeemer in Rio and the Washington Monument in D.C. -- it is its first shot at Armageddon the leveling of Los Angeles that makes the biggest impression. It is absolutely terrifying earthquakes 10.5s according to the press notes that do Our Town in in a big way. Streets buckle freeways collapse houses and office towers disintegrate before our eyes houses on the coast slide into the Pacific. This city has been taken down before but never like this.While a putative Maya prophecy that the world would end on Dec. 21 2012 plays a major part in ""2012s"" publicity the film itself is too busy destroying things to pay that forecast much mind.Instead were breathlessly informed that huge solar flares are creating nefarious rogue neutrinos that are heating the Earths core like a hot tub in the Hollywood Hills. This comes to the attention first of a charismatic scientist (Ejiofor) followed by the White House chief of staff (Platt) the president himself (Danny Glover) even the fetching first daughter (Thandie Newton).Unlike science fiction of an earlier generation the government immediately recognizes the crisis and the drama of ""2012"" such as it is revolves around how a remnant of the Earths population will be saved and who will be among the chosen. (If you guessed a bloated Russian plutocrat played by Zlatko Buric could buy his way in go to the head of the class).The main audience surrogate turns out to be idealistic science fiction writer Jackson Curtis (Cusack). His marriage to wife Kate (Peet) may be kaput his kids may be bonding with Kates new boyfriend Gordon (Tom McCarthy) but Jackson still finds time to take his son and daughter from L.A. to Yellowstone. There he meets over-the-top idiot savant Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson) who knows all and tells all about impending doom.As that pesky core heats up and destabilizes the Earths crust like nobodys business we see all kinds of destruction from oceans of fire to towering tsunamis not to mention plot contrivances that beggar description.Given that the film lasts a drawn-out 2 hours and 38 minutes judicious cuts would have been in order but any film that thinks ""youve got to see this"" is the height of sophisticated dialogue is not in the mood to be judicious. Not in the mood at all.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--2012MPAA rating PG-13 for intense disaster sequences and some languageRunning time 2 hours 38 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESA secular city turns its eye on the VaticanApril 22 2005MORE STORIES ABOUTHousesSpecial EffectsVatican CityCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-2012-13-2009nov13,0,6140773.story",200,20125,2012,latimes

Rick Groen From Thursdays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Nov. 12 2009 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English 2012 Directed by Roland Emmerich Written by Harald Kloser and Roland Emmerich Starring John Cusack Chiwetel Ejiofor Amanda Peet Classification 14A  Things fall down things blow up - you dont need to be Nigella to cook up a disaster flick. The recipe for disaster unlike for Bundt cake or success is awfully easy Ships sink planes plummet volcanoes erupt the Earth quakes waves go tidal towers get infernal. Better yet the bigger the calamity the simpler the mix. Check out the evidence here Want to heat up the Earths core then bring its crust to a roiling boil and the whole planet to a bitter end? No problem. Just take one Mayan prophecy sprinkle in a bunch of wonky neutrinos and voila - goodbye world. And hello Roland Emmerich a man who loves nothing better than to put the kaboom into doom. Yes its 2012 and do you know where your children are? Jackson does. Hes the divorced writer with two kids and a pretty ex-wife and a whole lot of underappreciated literary talent. Writers of disaster flicks do enjoy sticking themselves into their plots. Anyway at the outset Jackson doesnt realize our planetary home is fast approaching its demolition. By contrast Adrian the science wonk has known for a few years now. Hes even told Americas first black president who - aint it the way with first black presidents - has inherited quite the global mess. However the prez has made an executive decision to inform other sage world leaders yet not the panic-prone people themselves. In the interim said leaders have devised an escape plan but more about that latter. First with a reputation to uphold (forged on Independence Day) for blowing up monumental stuff Emmerich has business to take care of. He starts out daintily enough content to wipe California off the map. Happily Jackson along with those two kids and that pretty ex-wife and her tag-along boyfriend is driving the one car capable of racing a microsecond ahead of the cracking fault line all the while dodging fallen bridges and toppling buildings. So enchanted is the director with this visual feat we soon get to see an instant replay albeit with a small aircraft subbing for the now-discarded car. Repeat again with a clumsy RV in lieu of that small plane. And once more but this time with a way bigger airplane built to cross oceans and thus dodge way bigger things that fall down like mountains and even bigger things that swell up like tsunamis. Occasionally what with the world ending someone takes a quiet moment to make a goodbye phone call to someone else whereupon the score stops pounding the oceans cease their roar and a single tear flows. After watching three such identical calls I would have thought even the greediest god of repetition would have counted himself appeased. Then came the fourth. By now after a Roman detour to pad his statistics ( poof goes the Sistine Chapels iconic ceiling) Emmerich and his same old same old have taken us and a very busy cast deep into disasters second hour and then on to China. There cleverly hidden in the Himalayas is the aforementioned escape plan an ark. Actually seven arks similar to Noahs in their devotion to species continuation - giraffes and elephants and brainiacs two by two - but definitely higher-tech and with seat prices that reflect an inflation of biblical proportions. For those in the know a berth to Beyond costs a cool EUR1-billion a person (no mention if that includes a fuel surtax). So naturally even as the flood waters rise and the worlds clock ticks down and the darned ark cant get its motor running cause some darned obstacle is stopping the hydraulic door from sealing the darned air-tight hatch an ethical debate ensues. Is it fair that mainly the rich should survive? Or since they are rich has nature already selected them as fit for survival? Then again as one would-be Plato speculates ""Maybe we should have had a lottery?"" Speaking of random selection the performers include John Cusack Chiwetel Ejiofor Danny Glover Amanda Peet Oliver Platt Thandie Newton and Woody Harrelson. In the name of good apocalyptic fun Ill leave you to guess who plays who. Hint Bewigged and even wiggier than usual Woody does not play the first black American president. Second hint Save for the lucky ark-ivists the entire worlds population dies but not so youd notice or care. As always in Emmerichs rollicking Armageddons the cannon speaks with an expensive bang while the fodder gets afforded nary a whimper. Of course thats just part of disasters simple recipe Blow us up then blow us off.

Comments (4) click to enlarge 2012 Video Rated PG-13  2009 In accordance with the Mayan doomsday calendar ""mutated"" neutrinos emanating from the sun trigger spectacular CGI disasters on earth that culminate in a global flood. Semiprepared for such contingencies world governments scramble to complete a construction project on the upper slopes of the Himalayas gargantuan cruise ships that will carry an elite remnant of humanity through the forthcoming mega-tsunami. But none of that amounts to a hill of beans compared to the travails of John Cusack whos hustling hard to get his family onto one of the arks win back his estranged wife and regain the respect of his snippy tweener son. As you might expect with director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) the movie isnt a patch on the trailer. PG-13 158 min.

Yes 2012 is infantile. Yes it treats the deaths of six billion people as little more than a tragic footnote. Yes its about as interested in subtlety narrative invention or character development as the Corkscrew at Alton Towers.But what a ride. There are moments - sights sounds special effects - that have never been seen or imagined before sequences of staggering complexity immaculate detail and breathtaking scale. In summary it may seem like just another disaster movie but this one is bigger louder crazier and more wildly exhilarating than anything previously attempted even by  Roland Independence Day Emmerichs own smash n grab standards.The plot is little more than a framing device the MacGuffin something to do with sunspots plate tectonics and the Mayan calendar. The closest we have to a hero is John Cusacks shambolic failed author Jackson Curtis whose attempts to save his estranged family from a fiery death somehow involve Russian plutocrats Himalayan plane crashes and Woody Harrelson in a fez. But nobody goes to a movie like this for the storyline. This is disaster porn and unashamedly so pavements crack buildings topple crowds flee planes plummet and world leaders scramble to save their own skins as the planet goes to hell in a handcart.  Posterity will not be kind to 2012 - and it definitely wont work on DVD - but catch it on the biggest noisiest screen available and approach it on its own terms and itll knock your socks off.Read the directors guide the perfect disaster movie here By Tom Huddleston Posted Tuesday November 10 2009 Details Release details Rated 12A Release date Friday November 13 2009 Duration 158 mins Cast and crew Director Roland Emmerich Cast Woody HarrelsonJohn CusackAmanda PeetChiwetel Ejiofor Users say (54) 3 out of 5 stars Average User Rating3.3 / 5Rating Breakdown5 star244 star53 star42 star41 star17LiveReviews|541 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew ReviewsRefresh2 minutes agoJane G.TastemakerFeaturedI really love disaster movies Lots of action and adventure Kind of old now but I recently saw it again and loved it all over again.?Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 20 2013maheen khanFeatured2012 is an exellent movie i have ever seenHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 20 2013maheen khanFeatured2012 is an exellent movie i have ever seenHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 14 2013Andy SFeaturedAwful.

The special effects are amazing on a big screen and that is the only positive. With the promise of seeing how the world copes with armageddon we actually get to see how a bunch of Americans cope. (Not sure why they get a ship to themselves when the whole of Africa or Australasia isnt fit enough to save). Those who have talked about suspending your disbelief and how original this film is need to step outside of the asylum every once in a while. The plot could not have been more predictable. Hands up if you thought Gordon would make it to the end of the film - no me neither and the mrs locking lips with another guy seconds after he got squished was unbelievable. The little ladys looking after the kids while us men save the world came straight out of the 1800s. Have we not grown out of the 5 minute speeches saying goodbye to your wife and building bridges with your kids when thousands of lives rest on your shoulders. And what has Roland Emmerich got against flying? As in Godzilla he chooses to use aircraft to dodge around and under things instead of going over them. I can only assume that a quality cast must have signed very solid contracts before reading the script. This looks great but I left the cinema feeling dirty.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 23 2009laurenFeaturedthe best bit is near the beginning when LA becomes a seething ocean of concrete falling buildings and crazy flying trains- awesome I couldnt stop laughing the chaos made me so happy. After that though? Its all a bit ho hum- mostly because the plot is so bad. One of the major dilemmas seems to be whether the people are going to be told the world is coming to an end.... well aside from causing even more chaos and mass panic by doing that.... I think the people might have already noticed... what with places like hawaii turning into a giant volcano and LA falling into the ocean... Something I found fascinating about this film was how few countries actually constituted the world basically if youre involved in the G8 you count..... dude. Dont even get me started on the get the guys up here and the guys better see this while the women sit uselessly reapplying their lipgloss. This film was mildly insulting and very rah rah America. Beyond that the first scenes of mega chaos just made me so happy Im giving it three stars just for that.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 22 2009KateFeaturedThe first half of this movie filled me with glee with all the crazy destruction - then I started to notice the completely rubbish plot and characters you dont care about. Aerial stunts by trains and african fauna are fabulous in many ways and and Woody Harrelsons turn as a beardy-weirdy still make this well worth a look though.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 21 2009KateFeaturedI like Kanes comment that you never know what is going to happen next I think it was pretty much the same story as The Day After Tomorrow except with heat rather than cold. I really had an enjoyable time watching it although the story is crap and the end lame and not one believable moment. The world ends and and nearly everyone dies but that isnt sad at all in this film. Its a real feel-good all American type family film. Death and destruction being a 12A? Its fun but pure fantasy and full of jokes. . Dont know what effects Roland Emmerich will come up with next hes done it all in this one.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 21 2009LawrenceFeaturedThe movie started slow nothing different form other disaster movies but it took a different turn when the supermaket split in half. I love the scene when the volcano errupted. Good special effects. it felt like I was there.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 21 2009ashleeFeaturedthe closing line of the movie is im not scared anymore daddy. no more pull-ups enough said.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 20 2009HerbdebopFeaturedStarts out impressively with great effects and tension but descends into a real turkey dinner with trimmings of scientific claptrap gallons of schmalz and hammy acting.

The wealthy and politicos prepare to save themselves whilst the rest of mankind is kept in ignorance. The city footage of skyscrapers collapsing together are awesome and theres enough character development to hold a modicum of human interest between the epic scenes of global damage. Great escapist fun and the movie house cheered when the fat iconic Russian billionaire took a no returns swan dive.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 14 2009anderlouFeaturedIf youre expecting a huge Hollywood disaster movie full of great special f/x thats what youll get. If youre expecting a quality drama with well-rounded characters and intelligent script youll be very disappointed. I knew what to expect and I loved it Daft but I was glued to my seat.

Barnum of the apocalypse Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day""). Starring John Cusack Amanda Peet Thandie Newton Woody Harrelson Danny Glover Chiwetel Ejiofor Oliver Platt Chin Han Beatrice Rosen Jimi Mistry Director Roland Emmerich Running time 238 Release Opened Nov 13 2009  Editorial Review Its a perfect disasterBy Dan KoisFriday Nov. 13 2009If a film critic awards four stars to a movie directed by Roland Emmerich -- Hollywoods reigning king of catastrophe the critically scorned director of ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"" -- will the world come to an end? Thats a question the ancient Mayans never asked but its the one facing me after the enormously satisfying astonishingly accomplished reprehensible-yet-irresistible ""2012"" the crowning achievement in Emmerichs long profitable career as a destroyer of worlds.Starting with the long-held misapprehension that the Mayan calendar picks 2012 as the date of humanitys doom Emmerich fleshes out that bit of pseudo-history with some pseudo-science -- some nonsense about solar flares and neutrinos heating the Earths core -- and throws hundreds of millions of dollars and an expertly chosen cast at it. The result is a movie that takes the manifold guilty pleasures of such past Emmerich extravaganzas as ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" -- not to mention the Emmerich-inspired ""Armageddon"" and ""Deep Impact"" -- and amplifies and expands them until they fill up 2 1/2 overstuffed hours.""2012"" takes the disaster movie -- once content simply to threaten the Earth with a comet or blow up the White House -- to its natural conclusion the literal end of the world.And boy for aficionados of cinematic catastrophe ""2012"" does it right. As a spectacle-delivery device it has no peer. Other movies have explosions; ""2012"" has an atom-bomb-size detonation that wipes Yellowstone off the map. Other movies have earthquakes; ""2012"" sends California sinking in flames into the sea. Other movies kill thousands; ""2012"" kills zillions without breaking a sweat.If all this makes you feel sort of queasy -- if you cant imagine why anyone would want to watch entire continents destroyed -- ""2012"" is not the movie for you. For ""2012"" needless to say lacks all reasonable perspective. Its the kind of movie that expects that audiences shortly after watching the entire population of India subsumed by a tidal wave will urge on a fluffy white dog as she crosses a chasm and leaps into her owners arms. Its the kind of movie that has a father conduct a heart-to-heart with his son shortly before belly-landing a jumbo jet on a glacier. It preys on an audiences willingness to cheer for heroes even as we consign faceless masses to the narrative dustbin. It recognizes the thrill of the vicarious experience and the appeal of the clean slate. Behind on your mortgage? Overdue library books? Dont sweat it.So what makes ""2012"" a four-star movie? In an era in which Hollywood seems unable to execute even the most uncomplicated formulas the ones that used to come easily ""2012"" is pardon the expression a revelation. It gets everything right. The actors are right John Cusack as a sardonic failed novelist Amanda Peet as his wife Tom McCarthy as her nice-guy new husband Chiwetel Ejiofor as a conscience-stricken scientist Oliver Platt as a snappish White House official WoodyHarrelson as a radio-host crackpot. The storytelling is right You will never be bored for there will always be questions to answer. Who will survive? How will Cusack get his family to China where salvation awaits the rich the connected and the just plain lucky? What will Emmerich blow up next? And the dialogue is right a rich blend of wisecrack and cheese with a few moist-eyed goodbyes sprinkled here and there for good measure.Most important the special effects are so right. In fact they are incredible. Emmerich is a virtuoso of panoramic cataclysm and each of his dozens of wide shots is as densely packed with hellish detail as a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Power lines snapping in an earthquake sparks flashing like distant fireworks; Honolulu on fire; mournful giraffes in slings airlifted by helicopters through the snowy Himalayas.Is ""2012"" art? Absolutely not. It reminds us that cinema exists not only to make art but also to expertly create sensation like no other medium. When done well that can be just as valuable and just as astonishing. But is ""2012"" a sublime example of the kind of huge-budget entertainment that Hollywood does best -- indeed the only kind of moviemaking at which Hollywood continues to excel? Yes. It is certainly the best movie of its kind ever made. It should (but surely will not) be the last movie of its kind ever made. After ""2012"" would-be Emmerichs will have a hard time impressing audiences with their asteroids and their space invaders. This is the way the world ends with a bang.Kois is a freelance reviewer.At area theaters. Contains intense disaster sequences and adult language.

Photo I dont know about you but Id gladly pay 12 to watch Los Angeles gloriously sliding into the Pacific like so much rubble in Roland Emmerichs exhilaratingly nutty mother-of-all-disaster movies ""2012."" Emmerich who did a job on New York City in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" thankfully spares us further apocalyptic scenes here. But this showman shows no such mercy toward Las Vegas and Vatican City (watch for a great sight gag in the Sistine Chapel) both swallowed up by an ""inbalance"" in the Earths crust that among other things relocates the South Pole to Wisconsin. It must have been hard to top his demolition of the White House in ""Independence Day"" but Emmerich rises to the occasion. Im not sure I will ever forget the sight of a tsunami-borne aircraft carrier bearing down on both the structure and an astonished President Danny Glover tending to victims on the White House front lawn while his hissable chief adviser (Oliver Platt) has taken control of the nation. As you might suspect the ""2012"" dialogue is pure Velveeta delivered by the likes of the great John Cusack as Jackson a failed sci-fi-novelist-turned-cliffhanger-prone limo driver/divorced dad. His vacation with the kids in Yellowstone National Park results in an encounter with a government scientist Adrian (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who is coincidentally one of fewer than 400 readers of Jacksons epic ""Farewell Atlantis."" Also conveniently on hand is a conspiracy theorist (Woody Harrelson way over the top even by his own standards) who alerts Jackson not only to the impending ""rapture"" but to the governments planned evacuation effort for ""genetic specimens"" of the super-wealthy. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" made a stab at plausibility by invoking global warming but you dont have to be a geology major (as I was briefly) to understand that the mumbo jumbo offered here is but a pretext for lots of eye-popping earthquakes fireballs (Yellowstone memorably turns into an active volcano) and tidal waves (that engulf among other things a massive cruise ship where George Segal performs). Did I mention this is great fun? Only a movie critic without a sense of humor would question whether you could really drive a limo straight through a collapsing skyscraper. Or how a plastic surgeon with minimal flying experience (Tom McCarthy better known as the director of ""The Visitor"") could co-pilot a massive Russian cargo jet on a trip to China. Or whether the Dalai Lama really owns a pickup truck. That plastic surgeon is the boyfriend of Jacksons ex-wife (Amanda Peet) who figures in one of the films two romantic subplots. When he isnt monitoring the apocalypse government scientist Adrian flirts with the presidents daughter (Thandie Newton) who has been tasked with saving the worlds ""culture"" a process that inadvertently triggers the Princess Diana-like death of the head of the Louvre. The films 158 minutes are crammed with such laugh-provoking digressions and dialogue as well as more movie references than youd find in half a dozen Quentin Tarantino features. ""Titanic"" ""Earthquake"" ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" ""The Hurricane"" -- theyre all here and more complete with Adam Lambert musically channeling Maureen McGovern (""The Poseidon Adventure"") as he warbles over the closing credits. About the only thing thats missing from ""2012"" (except sanity) is 3-D IMAX and Sensurround. For those I would gladly pay 20 a ticket. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Jon King to take Lou Dobbs slot Read Next Jon King to take Lou Dobbs slot Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 71343 How Hillary blew her big moment 38013 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 20134 Judge blasts Nick Denton for lying about Gawker stock value Now On Is cheating to blame in Mary J.

All of it happens in ""2012.""<<1234>>Should the world bite the dust come 2012 lets hope it goes out in the crazy grandiose fashion director Roland Emmerich imagines.The apocalypse would be a bit of a bummer but in Emmerichs vision youll be too busy to care about anything profound or remotely logical. Billions would die and slabs of SoCal would cleave off into the Pacific while quakes tsunamis and volcanic eruptions would send humanity scurrying about as if caught in a video game. As choreographed by the director of ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" Earths death knell would actually come off as a whole lot more chipper than all those Debbie Downer doomsday prophecies.This special-effects extravaganza spends little time with moral introspection. When it does try to dig deeper by raising class and immigrant issues it turns unintentionally hilarious. The laughs could have resulted in a catastrophe of colossal proportions were this a serious-minded film but ""2012"" is so goofy that laughing with it and at it is part of its charm.As for the films raison detre -- the Mayan calendar prediction that a cataclysmic event will occur in 2012 -- only lip service is paid to it; a mere setup for the buckle-your-seats chaos that ensues. ""2012"" excels as a big-budget behemoth designed solely to thrill and entertain and boy does it ever accomplish that -- with style and brass.Advertisement Even with its amazing CGI-effect set pieces -- a twin-engine plane struggling to outrace projectile lava in Yellowstone Park and a car dodging toppling skyscrapers and buckling freeways in the Los Angeles area -- ""2012"" takes it cues from the old-school disaster film textbook.Emmerich and co-screenwriter Harald Kloser stitch together the choicest elements from late 70s and early 80s disaster movies -- ""Earthquake"" ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (not the terrible remake) and ""Tidal Wave."" They even tip their hat to more contemporary fare such as ""Armageddon"" and ""Titanic."" The best disaster films and ""2012"" is in that league succeed not just because of amazing special effects goofy dialogue and perilous situations. Cast members although mere pawns for the action play a major role and must leave larger-than-life impressions. Who could forget the tragic/hilarious sight of dear Shelley Winters taking that fateful plunge and showing us a flash of her knickers in ""The Poseidon Adventure""? ""2012"" finds its Winters in Woody Harrelson. (He keeps his knickers mostly on.) Too bad Emmerich dispatches his crackpot character pickle-chomping conspiracy theorist Charlie Frost early. Fortunately were left rooting for a team of appealing actors including John Cusack as luckless novelist and family man Jackson Curtis who turns into a kind of unlikely prophet; Chiwetel Ejiofor as government scientist Adrian Helmsley who alerts world leaders about the Earths crust getting cooked; and Oliver Platt as shrewd politician Carl Anheuser who shows his true colors later on. Danny Glover as the befuddled president and Thandie Newton as his do-gooder daughter are all but wasted. Ejiofor gives us the most complex performance eking out genuine emotion despite the rampant silliness around him.Still ""2012"" doesnt belong to the cast but to Emmerich. The director has had his share of dogs especially the lame ""10000 B.C."" and the stultifying ""Godzilla.""Here he asks for no forgiveness and goes all commando on ending the world setting the anarchy in polar opposites such as Vegas and Tibet. Sound idiotic? Preposterous? You bet. But ""2012"" delivers the disaster-movie goods better than any other popcorn movie weve seen since the 80s.

This oafish epic about the End of Days--as predicted by the Mayan calendar--operates in a dead zone roughly equidistant between parody and idiocy. You do get the connection between tongue and cheek but much of the humor still goes thud. A few action sequences rise to the challenge of the subject but many of the digital effects look murky and the cumulative effect is numbness. The only character with genuine if grotesque energy is Charlie Frost a crackpot prophet conspiracy theorist and pirate radio broadcaster played by Woody Harrelson; he provides a few jolts of Rapture schlock before the movie turns into destructo drek. For better or (mainly) worse Mr. Emmerich is up to his old tricks. In ""Independence Day"" he tested our mettle with marauding aliens. In ""The Day After Tomorrow"" he unleashed global warming that precipitated global freezing. This time his cosmic weapon of choice is a beam of mutant neutrinos that emanates from the sun and by heating the earths core destabilizes tectonic plates defeats coherence (though the huge disjointed production might have been conceived as a study in chaos theory) and degrades dialogue. (""An unprecedented international venture is under way"" the American president tells his daughter during an intimate conversation couched in the near-English favored by Emmerich films.) ENLARGE A scene from 2012 Columbia Pictures The international venture involves building what Charlie suspects to be a fleet of space ships that will save the rich and powerful before our planet goes the way of Krypton; to get a seat the wild-eyed geezer says ""youd have to be Bill Gates or Rupert Murdoch or some Russian billionaire."" (Of the three only a particularly obnoxious Russian billionaire has a confirmed reservation.) Since the White House has kept a lid of secrecy on the existence of the ships--which arent really what Charlie suspects--it falls to the presidents chief science advisor Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to uncover the truth. Once he does however Adrian like his boss seems blithely indifferent to the ventures ethical aspects which arent debated until the movies climax. (The president finally wonders aloud if seats on the ships should have been offered in a lottery. That sounds like a plan except for leaving six or seven billion passengers wait-listed.) ENLARGE John Cusack catches a plane in 2012. Columbia Pictures The script is so scatterbrained that no one ever seems to understand anything in real time; its as if all reactions are on 30-minute delay. (The running time is 158 minutes.) Whats more ""2012"" has no discernible attitude toward the end of civilization apart from the belief that theres a movie in it. The cast includes John Cusack as Jackson Curtis a sci-fi novelist turned limo driver; Amanda Peet as Jacksons ex-wife Kate; Danny Glover as the president; Thandie Newton as his daughter; and Oliver Platt as the presidents steely chief of staff. Among the points of interest either damaged disturbed or destroyed are Las Vegas the Vatican the Himalayas the South Pole (relocated to Wisconsin) the Washington Monument much of Wyoming and all of California. For once Manhattan meets its fate offstage. Pirate Radio ""Pirate Radio"" follows the form--when it chooses to follow any form--of a cat-and-mouse game between the British government circa 1966 and a crew of raffish DJs beaming round-the-clock rock n roll from a decrepit tanker anchored in the North Sea just outside Albions territorial waters. Whitehall in the person of a puritanical government minister played by Kenneth Branagh views the ship and its transmissions as ""a sewer."" The ships captain and station owner a spacey dandy played by Bill Nighy sees his vessel as an island of anarchy in a sea of conformity. (At the time BBC radio barely acknowledged rocks existence.) Richard Curtiss comedy is anchored only in exuberance but thats more than you can say for most movies these days; it keeps you beaming with pleasure. ENLARGE Tom Sturridge looks on as Rhys Ifans handles the mic in Pirate Radio. Focus Features Mr. Curtis first made his mark in feature films as the writer of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill."" Until now his only experience as a big-screen filmmaker was as the writer-director of ""Love Actually"" a mixed bag of romantic notions in which Hugh Grant played a British prime minister and Mr. Nighy was an aging drug-addled rock star. ""Pirate Radio"" (which was originally called ""The Boat That Rocked"") is another mixed bag if truth be told. The writing can get fairly ragged in between the many felicities. The direction recalls but seldom approaches the elegant anarchy of Richard Lesters Beatles films. Some comic bits work beautifully--Im partial to a silent buddy-bonding scene involving cookies and a glass of coffee--while others work haltingly or not at all. Yet the movies flaws matter little when theyre measured against its marvelous music terrific performances and vivid sense of place at a special time--not just a rust bucket in the North Sea but Great Britain two decades after the devastation of World War II in the throes of a pop-cultural revolution. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a DJ called The Count; his work is as always an amalgam of the mysteriously laconic and the enjoyably histrionic. Other members of the fine cast are Rhys Ifans Nick Frost Tom Sturridge Rhys Darby Talulah Riley and January Jones as well as Emma Thompson in a cheery cameo. And a looseness of form doesnt exclude a profusion of events or a panoply of borrowings from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" through ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Titanic"" to the civilian flotilla of rescue vessels at Dunkirk. ""Pirate Radio"" takes freely and gives generously. Fantastic Mr. Fox Life is full of surprises. The best one Ive had in a good while is ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" Wes Andersons stop-action animated version of the classic childrens novel by Roald Dahl. Who could have guessed--certainly not me--that animation and Mr. Anderson most recently the director of ""The Darjeeling Limited"" would be an inspired and mutually inspiring match? Instead of the vapid motion-capture process of ""A Christmas Carol"" he and his collaborators give us a captivating entertainment for the holiday season and well beyond. ENLARGE Mr. Fox voiced by George Clooney aims to live up to his adjective in Fantastic Mr. Fox. Fox Searchlight Pictures The script which the director wrote with Noah Baumbach takes elaborate liberties with its source material. Now the bane of three farmers existence is a bushy-tailed newspaper columnist voiced by George Clooney. (His wife voiced by Meryl Streep had been urging him to stop stealing birds and find a new line of work.) If that sounds precious or improbable--a wild animal hasnt written a newspaper column since the days of Jimmy Breslin--the film is all of that and more the more being foxily funny. The visual style is a radical departure from the original Quentin Blake illustrations but a hugely endearing one thats rendered in exotic colors stuffed with more details than a Richard Scarry page and popping with zestful inventions. So whos the films audience? The voice cast alone should be a draw for adults--not just Mr. Clooney who gives a commanding (no kidding) comic performance but Ms. Streep Bill Murray Michael Gambon Willem Dafoe Jason Schwartzman Owen Wilson; theyre all delightful in their respective ways. And the look of the film should enchant kids who may be too young to savor the sophisticated script. All I can say for certain is that I didnt expect to be the audience for this lovely oddity but I was. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Still Crazy ( 1998) Bill Nighy has made a specialty of playing drugged-out rockers; its a dubious niche that he occupies with rare distinction. In this comedy directed by Brian Gibson he is Ray the former lead singer of Strange Fruit a 1970s band trying to pull itself together for a 20th-anniversary concert. Poor ravaged Ray coming up on his 50th birthday has an icy epiphany on a frozen canal in Holland and the pain of the moment may leave you gasping rather than laughing. The movie a bittersweet song of yearning and unlikely reconciliation was written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. ENLARGE Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) John Cusacks disconsolate hit man Martin Q. Blank decides to kill two birds with one stone. On the same weekend hes supposed to assassinate someone in his home town of Grosse Pointe an affluent suburb of Detroit he searches for meaning in his life by attending his 10th high-school reunion. Its a premise that could quickly turn ugly (or simply go flat as it does toward the end). Mainly though the director George Armitage working from a dense script by Tom Jankiewicz D.V. DeVincentis Steve Pink and Mr. Cusack sustains an impressive level of crazed logic and whirligig energy. ENLARGE The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004) This quixotic comedy like ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" was directed by Wes Anderson and written by him and Noah Baumbach. And this movie like their new one uses stop-action though only briefly to populate a magical ocean with fanciful fish. Bill Murray plays the Cousteau-like hero an oceanographer-documentarian whos at once funny screwy childish gallant and rueful or downright depressed. When I reviewed ""The Life Aquatic"" I worried that Mr. Anderson by insisting overmuch on cleverness ""could be walking a plank of his own construction."" If any of that was true he has tossed the plank and in ""Mr. Fox"" gained a solid new footing. -- Joe Morgenstern Find television listings at LocateTV.

Theyre two of the few survivors in a tale of epic world destruction caused by shifting of the earths plates. (Joe Lederer) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday November 12 2009 523 PM Title 2012 Apparently no one told Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"") that theres a recession going on. Theres not a hint of restraint in his latest budget-buster ""2012"" which reportedly cost 260 million. All that money can buy some jaw-dropping special effects but not it seems a script worth a dime.I could fairly describe the ""2012"" plot as follows The highest-paid members of an indifferent cast survive the massive floods and giant fireballs that cause our planets destruction. Nothing else matters frankly. But if you need more here are the details As an ecological cataclysm spreads across the globe divorced dad Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) races to save his kids (Liam James Morgan Lily) his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and her husband (Tom McCarthy). For most people doom is nigh. But a few lucky folks were prepared for disaster thanks to the warnings of a government scientist (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and some ancient Mayans. As a result the President (Danny Glover) and an aide (Oliver Platt) have arranged for special arks to rescue the best brightest and wealthiest citizens of the world. Once Jackson hears about them hes determined to get his family on board no matter what it takes.You read that story line in what two minutes? Somehow Emmerich stretches it out to nearly three hours. Its not enough to watch California fall into the ocean. We also see countless other places drown crash burn and suffer every sort of destruction imaginable. The effects it must be said are awesome. And theyd better be since theyre the sole reason for the movies existence. Granted Cusack is enjoyable even when hes on autopilot and Woody Harrelson has fun in his brief scenes as a prophetic madman. But everyone else sinks under the weight of inadvertently hilarious dialogue and not one of the half-dozen threads makes actual sense. For Emmerich its all about the spectacle. He makes good on his end of the deal as long as you dont expect anything more than a giant tub of popcorn and a mindless night out.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

ABOUT THE MOVIE2012  (out of four) Stars John Cusack Chiwetel Ejiofor Amanda Peet Oliver Platt Danny Glover Woody HarrelsonDirector Roland EmmerichDistributor Sony PicturesRating PG-13 for intense disaster sequences and some languageRunning time 2 hours 40 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY ""Were all gonna die"" In 2012 the mother of all disaster movies this be-all end-all of cliches - best when shrieked at the top of ones lungs - must be uttered to make the experience complete. And on that were not disappointed. TRAILER See if 2012 has your number MORE Its the thrill of destruction Nor is the epic nature of the cataclysm left wanting as the mayhem is dialed up to massive proportions in this end-of-days extravaganza. The movie is an undeniable visual spectacle but just as unequivocally a cheesy ridiculous story. Computer-generated scenes of the world falling apart are both impressive and ludicrous. We see such iconic images as the Washington Monument toppling Rio de Janeiros Christ the Redeemer statue taking a dive and St. Peters Basilica crumbling. The Himalayas take a hit from a jet and Los Angeles freeways collapse faster than you can say gridlock. The global obliteration is associated with the end and restarting of the Maya calendar and widespread solar flares. While a few characters throw around jargon the science is murky. But science is hardly the point. At the heart of the story is Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) a failed novelist father of two and ex-husband of Kate (Amanda Peet). He must band together with them and his wifes new beau (Tom McCarthy) for a harrowing plane ride from Los Angeles to Yellowstone where he consults Charlie (Woody Harrelson) a conspiracy crackpot. Charlie has a map of where the government has hidden ""spaceships"" for such an eventuality. Meanwhile scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) warns U.S. President Wilson (Danny Glover) that its the end of the world. At best 2012 is preposterous fun with boggling special effects. Unintentional humor is a highlight often spoken by characters who are not just paper-thin theyre emaciated. Director Roland Emmerich (The Day After Tomorrow) is said to have spent 260 million on this array of catastrophic images. But the story is beside the point and the protracted ending is anti-climactic. Only Cusack and Ejiofor convey intelligence and humanity. But if youre looking for earthquakes that outpace the Richter scale tsunamis that swallow land masses and smoke that obliterates national parks this is that movie. Its a global demolition derby. And at more than 21/2 hours the annihilation nearly unfolds in real time. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

We probably are nearing the end of the movie world when its easy to predict that the biggest turd in the bowl will rise to the top of the box office. Equally depressing is the pass some critics are giving to this 158 minute (you heard me) slog through every end-of-days cliche in the Hollywood playbook. The fresh angle is the Mayan calendar that allegedly predicts that we will all bite the bullet on Dec. 21st 2012. The Mayans should sue.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> See Peter Travers review 2012 on ""At the Movies with Peter Travers"" Where to start apportioning blame? How about director Roland Emmerich who threatened the world with aliens in Independence Day global warming in The Day After Tomorrow and now solar fire from the earths core in 2012. Maybe bad movies will lead to global annihilation next time. We deserve it. The human side of the plot concerns Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) a struggling sci-fi novelist and divorced dad whose wife (Amanda Peet) left him because -- yes daytime drama fans -- he loves his work more than her. The only thing that fascinated me about Cusacks character -- who moonlights as a chauffeur -- is the skinny black tie he wears constantly even while surviving natural disasters in California Vegas Yellowstone D.C. the Vatican India Tibet and a big space thingie meant to be a New Age Noahs Ark. Did I mention that Danny Glover plays the President and that he makes dire speeches without prodding from his evil chief of staff (Oliver Platt) who wants only to save only the elite while billions perish? Get more news and reviews from Peter Travers on the Travers Take Look I cant mention any more because it reminds me of how bored I was during the movie. In the interest of fairness I will say that the FX is killer as Cusack and kids make their zigzag escape in a car as Santa Monica crumbles underneath them and that Woody Harrelson has a high old time of it as a crazed radio DJ whose eyes pop from the conspiracy theories exploding inside his head. But thats it. The rest is the absence of silence. Just the noise and cheeseball pyrotechnics that Hollywood regularly substitutes for intelligence and wit. Welcome to 2009.

Media San Francisco Chronicle 2012 Sci-fi action. Starring John Cusack Amanda Peet Chiwetel Ejiofor and Danny Glover. Directed by Roland Emmerich. (PG-13. 158 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its hard to do justice to this ridiculous wonderful movie. To describe ""2012"" is to make it sound like every other end-of-the-world disaster epic youve ever seen. And it is. Its a Roland Emmerich film very like his others - ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" - about an epic global catastrophe that begins ... But wait. You already know how it begins In a small room a scientist looks at a computer screen and mutters ... ""My God"" Sure youve seen this before and yet you havent not quite like this. People talk about ""formula"" almost always as a pejorative but formulas get to be formulas because they work and theres something to be said for a formula picture done almost to perfection. In ""2012"" Emmerich gives you everything you expect but gives it to you bigger. Imagine a car racing through a neighborhood in Pasadena as the street and the houses behind it crumble into the center of the Earth. Imagine a plane taking off on a disintegrating runway - and having to fly around falling buildings and an unmoored elevated train. Imagine massive tidal waves sweeping through coastal cities and wiping out (you guessed it) major landmarks. Now imagine everything twice as grand as youre picturing it.

The action film will be released November 13 2009. Photo Courtesy Of Columbia Tristar 2012 is formula action movie turned up to 10 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Sure youll laugh at ""2012"" - I laughed at it; laughing at it is part of the experience - but youll do it from the edge of your seat. This time the core of the Earth is overheating. A government scientist (Chiwetel Ejiofor) working in concert with a colleague in India calculates that soon the Earths crust will destabilize. Entire continents will disappear and other landmasses will migrate thousands of miles in the course of a day. This means the guaranteed death of billions and billions of people (and animals) and the end of the world as we know it. Not surprisingly the government led by the president (Danny Glover) decides to sit on this information and so for a good long stretch the audience has the fun of knowing more than the characters. John Cusack plays Jackson a sci-fi writer who takes his kids to Yellowstone only to find that his favorite lake has dried up. Meanwhile California is getting hit by a series of bizarre localized earthquakes. In one spectacular early scene a crevice opens up right down the center of a supermarket aisle. Like Kentucky Fried Chicken Emmerich does one thing but he does it right. He inserts moments of welcome black comedy as when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (played by a look-alike) somehow still in office announces that the worst is over - only to be interrupted by the worst quake yet. And Emmerich makes sure that the special effects are nothing less than jaw-dropping. The scene of Cusack driving with his family as the world caves in behind him has to go down as one of the best CGI sequences ever filmed. Along the way Emmerich who co-wrote the script with Harald Kloser (""The Day After Tomorrow"") tries to create a panorama of American life from the hard-nosed government bureaucrat (Oliver Platt) to the whacked out conspiracy-theory-loving radio host (Woody Harrelson). In one case he goes too far The tiny subplot about an old musician (George Segal in a vague echo of Judd Hirsch in ""Independence Day"") belonged on the cutting-room floor. But for a 158-minute movie theres very little fat. And although it is true that ""2012"" is at its best in the first half that first half is incredibly satisfying and the second half doesnt flag. Emmerichs characters may be rough sketches but he casts them well and having people you care about at the center of a disaster makes the special effects that much more effective. You dont want to see Cusack and Amanda Peet fall into the Earths core after all. At the same time ""2012"" is a light film with very little introspection and an upbeat tone thats undiminished by the implied slaughter of about 7 billion people. This is ludicrous and yet its interesting in that it may signal a shift within the culture at large. For seven years following 9/11 we had a series of films depicting civic chaos and destruction and these films were invariably downbeat or at least cautionary. (Even ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was about the threat of global warming.) In those years within the context of a brainless action movie you simply could not show an American landmark getting annihilated. People wouldnt stand for it. Only an audience that feels invulnerable can enjoy watching on screen the wholesale destruction of its civilization and not take it as a threat. A cloud has lifted. Its safe to be happy and brainless again. ""2012"" may be Hollywoods first post-post-9/11 movie. -- Advisory This film contains extreme action sequences.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Crowd-pleasing global annihilation is the goal of ""2012"" and darned if they dont accomplish it. A big loud blow-you-out-of-your-seat blockbuster of the kind usually released in midsummer it features all the stock cataclysms and characters of bygone doomsday epics. Once again we meet those familiar figures the idealistic scientist the pigheaded politician the sympathetic and steadfast family man and the obligatory cute females who exist to be imperiled and add love interest. This time however theyre a bit more interesting than the usual disaster people doing the usual disaster things. ""2012"" is a have-it-both-ways hip/square doomsday movie. It serves up slaphappy sight gags in the midst of pulse-racing action crises handling the threat of human extinction with just the right combination of facetiousness and sincerity. While films like ""Armageddon"" offer the cop-out finale of disaster averted its clear from the get-go that ""2012"" follows the clearance sale motto ""Everything Must Go."" Our guide through the end of days is Chiwetel Ejiofor a rock-steady geologist who connects the dots between several unsettling geophysical anomalies. It seems that the sun has unleashed a swarm of killer neutrinos that cooked our planets core like a microwaved potato. One thing leads to another and soon tectonic plates will be breaking like dishes after a Greek wedding. Weekend dad John Cusack takes his little kids camping in Yellowstone where he encounters Woody Harrelson a gonzo radio personality specializing in crackpot theories. A seize-the-day and seize-the-beer kind of guy Harrelson contends that Earth is doomed just as the Mayans foresaw and the worlds governments are involved in historys biggest coverup. Before he can prove his theory the Earths crust starts to buckle. The only adult survivors of Los Angeles are a plastic surgeon a failed writer and a divorcee which seems like a pretty accurate population sample. 2012  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense disaster sequences and language. Films of this sort are plotted shish kebab style disaster change of scenery new disaster. But on the level of spectacle ""2012"" is top-notch. The demolition of L.A. is imagined with diabolical delight with visual zingers equal to ""Twisters"" beloved flying cow. Skyscrapers come down their shattered windows shimmering like glitter. Tibetans find a good reason to take up surfing. As he did in ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" director Roland Emmerich memorably destroys the White House. The capital and ineffectual president Danny Glover are wiped out by the USS John F. Kennedy boogie-boarding in on a killer tidal wave. As a subscriber to the theory that science fiction films reflect societys worries I read this as a longing for a national purpose and national heroes for a more innocent version of America. Of course maybe its just a cool special effect. Each twist or turn leads to yet another chase or confrontation and the film has great fun with stock disaster scenarios. Frantically trying to out-speed an earthquake Cusack finds himself stuck behind North Americas slowest driver. Its obligatory for a global disaster movie to trash the Eiffel Tower and they make a throwaway joke of it here. Theres even a subplot shout-out to ""The Poseidon Adventure."" If youre willing to let go of outmoded values like ""plausibility"" and ""narrative"" youll find plenty to love in ""2012.""

But in laymans terms the Earths molten core overheats and expands causing the planets crust to crack and shrink. The result Off-the-charts seismic shock waves and tsunamis that raise the sea level to the peak of Mount Everest.As there is no way to stop this cataclysm which was predicted in 2009 by astrophysicist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and unsuccessful sci-fi novelist Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) the plot is about preparing for The End. Will anyone exist after the geothermal Judgment Day? And if they do will it be the survival of the fleetest - or the richest?Jackson estranged from wife Kate (Amanda Peet) just happens to take his kids to Yellowstone National Park for a camping trip when he sees a familiar lake has dried up and the geothermal activity is more active.There he encounters crackpot shock jock Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson) who alerts his listeners to the End of Days. Charlie claims to have intelligence that the super-rich have booked passage on a high-tech Ark that is humanitys only hope. At Yellowstone Jackson coincidentally encounters Helmsley one of the three people to read his sci-fi fable about maintaining human cooperation and democracy during a global cataclysm.Back in Washington the president (Danny Glover) joins other world leaders in preparing for the end of the old world and the beginning of the new. In a movie like this plot is just an excuse to jump from one scenic place to the next watching as they fall into sea and chasm. (What this movie has to do with a Mayan prophecy of the Earths destruction is anybodys guess.)The hope is that the heroes can avoid the toppling buildings buckling roads and molten rivers which for the most part they do. As Jackson drives the kids ex-wife and her new beau (Tom McCarthy) through a crumbling Los Angeles I found myself reaching for a phantom video-game controller to help Our Heroes and Heroine defy certain death.In this disasterthon that runs a draggy 21/2 hours Emmerich whose movies specialize in the computer-generated destruction of the worlds most beloved landmarks levels the Rockies the Andes and the Himalayas. Devastation strikes sinners and saints. Los Angeles and Las Vegas are Sodom and Gomorrah the first cities to tumble in the shock waves. Next to go are the holy sites St. Peters in Rome and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio.To call 2012 an orgy of disaster is an understatement. It is a saturnalia of disaster reaching from Earth to Pluto and back a compendium of every disaster movie put together. Given Emmerichs formula of Titanic plus Earthquake plus The Poseidon Adventure theres a whole lotta shaking and quaking goin on.There are some grace notes in his film like the world leaders who choose to remain with their people rather than covertly use the equivalent of a golden escape hatch. Give Emmerich credit for casting his pictures across the age spectrum so that people of all ages are emotionally invested. But essentially 2012 is a wild ride that says never mind that eight billion people die so long as eight movie stars - and a dog - live.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

""2012"" Movie Review -- Remember ""Independence Day"" that alien invasion movie with great special effects that made a ton of money? You dont remember it half as well as its director Roland Emmerich. Because he turned it into a blueprint for ""2012."" 2012 (PG-13) Columbia (158 min.) Directed by Roland Emmerich. With John Cusack Amanda Peet Chiwetel Ejiofor. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO STARS Ratings note The film contains approximately 6 billion acts of violence. That first movie had a geeky scientist hero (Jeff Goldblum) a dad with family issues (Will Smith) a heroic president (Bill Pullman) a lone wingnut (Randy Quaid) a crabby Jewish father (Judd Hirsch) a cute dog in jeopardy and lots of international monuments blowing up. This new movie has a geeky scientist hero (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a dad with family issues (John Cusack) a heroic president (Danny Glover) a lone wingnut (Woody Harrelson) a crabby Jewish father (George Segal) a cute dog in jeopardy and lots of international monuments blowing up. Well there is one difference. The first movie wasnt boring. This one however which clocks in at well over 21/2 disaster-prone hours is pretty stultifying. Actors say silly lines with deadly seriousness. Exposition is wielded like a sledgehammer. All you can do is grit your teeth and wait for the next wave of destruction. Columbia Pictures/SonyLily Morgan and John Cusack try to outrun disaster in ""2012."" There is one of course every half-hour or so -- the movie hasnt been so much written as plotted on a graph -- complete with national landmarks and religious icons torn to bits. No Muslim symbols though; as Emmerich has honestly and gracelessly admitted he dislikes all religions but gave Islam a pass for fear of a fatwa on his head. Judging by the audiences reaction at a recent screening he should probably still watch his back just on general principle. The destruction admittedly is all state-of-the-art -- half a century and many technical generations removed from the original ""When Worlds Collide."" But its all the same. Twice the hero drives a car just one yard ahead of ever-widening fissures; twice he flies in a plane that just barely dodges the looming obstacles ahead. By the midway point ""2012"" isnt just plagiarizing other movies its plagiarizing itself. The plot has something to do with a planetary alignment (predicted by the Mayans of course) which has somehow caused a rapid increase in solar flares. This in turn has caused neutrinos to mutate into a new kind of particle and bombard the Earth where acting as microwaves theyve . . . Yeah that was where I stopped listening too. It all sounds about as plausible as that lecture about Solarnite in ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" Unfortunately as the films chief science guy Ejiofor bears the brunt of it giving long impassioned speeches in which more often than not he has to admit that hes actually been wrong and things are much worse than he thought. Ill say. Ejiofors a decent actor but his calling card on screen -- in ""Talk to Me"" in ""Dirty Pretty Things"" -- has always been pained sincerity. A movie that features a tidal wave hitting Washington D.C. is no place for it. What you need is an actor whos in on the joke -- even if its a private one hes sharing with the audience. Cusack is an actor like that; unfortunately hes stuck here playing the dad who -- as in ""Independence Day"" -- needs to have the entire world literally coming to an end to realize hes been kind of selfish. Glad to have helped you out with that life lesson fella. Makes all the cataclysmic conflagrations worth it. Cusack is pleasant of course but the part doesnt give him much room to show his sense of humor. And while Amanda Peet is certainly pretty to look at as his wife her role only requires that she open her eyes wide and occasionally scream ""Wait"" If the two dont embarrass themselves its only because theyre so forgettable. As is ""2012."" The effects are stupendous the people are attractive and there are a couple of nail-biting scenes. But its all stuff weve seen before (and done better) mashed into one movie. Toward the end I even recognized a scene from ""The Poseidon Adventure."" Worse I realized Id rather be watching ""The Poseidon Adventure.""

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + I like to imagine that the director Roland Emmerich had a key transformative experience at the age of 7 when a relative visiting from Bavaria accidentally trampled his scale model of the Reichstag. Suddenly a light bulb went on over our young Teutons head as he realized People will pay for this.In what exact sense he may have meant that remains ambiguous but Emmerich now stands as our premier Hollywood Disastermeister nuking and zapping historical landmarks in ""Independence Day ""The Day After Tomorrow ""Godzilla and other works of taste and forbearance. He has long since surpassed the previous title-holder producer Irwin Allen (""The Poseidon Adventure ""The Towering Inferno) to become the Cecil B. DeMille of his generation purveying jaw-dropping sensation yoked to cheap sentiment and appallingly (or is that appealingly?) flimsy characterizations.Allen after all only turned an ocean liner upside down. In ""2012 Emmerich flips our entire planet on its head. The result is a state-of-the-art multiplex three-ring circus whose special effects stagger the senses and play like a video game whose human drama aims for the cosmic and lands waist-deep in the Big Silly. Call it ""Apocalypse Really Soon or better yet ""Airport 2012.Whats the rumpus? Not the end-times foretold by the Mayan calendar but those darn solar neutrinos streaming from the sun and heating up the Earths core to a point where the crust has broken free and the continental plates start doing a merry dance. A few teacups get chipped California slides into the sea and Yellowstone Park blows straight up into the sky. And thats just the opening act.Emmerich and his co-writer Harald Kloser get the ""science of the movie out of the way fairly quickly starting their tale in 2009 as US government geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) journeys to India to get a first-hand peek at the planetary core from the bottom of a copper mine. It may look like a giant Jacuzzi to you but youre not a scientist in a Hollywood movie.Helmsley races back to Washington to warn President Wilson (kindly Danny Glover) and cabinet secretary Carl Anheuser (meanypants Oliver Platt) while ""2012 races to introduce us to the rest of the movies overcrowded passenger list. A disaster movie needs an Everyman so we have John Cusack as Jackson Curtis a divorced dad and author of failed sci-fi novels that everyone in the film seems to have read.Camping with his kids (Liam James and Morgan Lily) in Yellowstone brings Jackson in contact with both the geologists team and a conspiracy theorist (Woody Harrelson mining his tabloid crackpot persona for all its worth) who explains everything and has a map for it. This cues the main action of ""2012 Jackson his estranged wife Kate (Amanda Peet) her plastic-surgeon boyfriend (actor-director Tom McCarthy who must be wondering what on earth he stepped in) and the kids skedaddling from one literal hot spot to another as the ground caves in just behind them. Much of the movie takes place in the air (the boyfriends an amateur pilot) as our plucky survivors barrel between tilting buildings and beneath collapsing freeways. The carnage in ""2012 is distant and PG-13; Emmerich keeps us back from individual human suffering because thats just not box-office. Civilization here is a high-end ant farm and its death is the occasion for wonder pity and popcorn. We do zoom in on a few individual tragedies most of which befall the ethnic and the old. The sinful too the pop moralism of ""2012 isnt far from that of the ""Left Behind series or any classic Hollywood western.Glimpsed in the chaos of ""2012 are some welcome hambones Harrelson as mentioned; the wattle-shaking Platt; George Segal as a cruise-ship entertainer who really should have called home earlier (one of the films many inadvertent laughs); Zlatko Buric as a corrupt Russian industrialist whose voice seems to emanate from a vodka-soaked crypt beneath the Kremlin; Beatrice Rosen as the industrialists goodhearted bimbo mistress not quite as smart as her lapdog; the dog itself who gets a hilarious scene toward the end and who in fact may be the Shelley Winters of this particular enterprise.Its the end of the world and he feels fine. Page 46Did I mention the airborne giraffes? Or the Tibetan Buddhists who join our heroes mostly to provide new age spiritual validation and a climactic thumbs-up? Or Thandie Newton as the Presidents daughter making goo-goo eyes at Ejiofor and struggling with the potted dialogue which at times seems to have been poorly translated from the German? When Jackson and Kate stop in the middle of a cataclysmic deluge to discuss why their marriage failed the melodramatic double-vision of ""2012 turns actively ridiculous. Forget the Mayans - Humphrey Bogart had it right The problems of two people really dont amount to a hill of beans in this movies crazy world.Anyway admit it were here to see the Sistine Chapel come crashing down on thousands of screaming digital extras or the Washington Monument totter and fall or Caesars Palace tip into a fiery pit of magma (repent ye weekend gamblers). The attraction of disaster movies - which by definition have to get bigger and bigger if were still to feel them - is that they allow us to imagine our own extinction from the cheap seats jolting us with spectacle reframing our perspective sending us home safe and sound.In the wake of 9/11 (whose iconography this movie toys with in the form of collapsing skyscrapers and ash-covered faces) the need for entertainment apocalypse seems weirdly keener. ""2012 is only a movie and reassuringly so Its one huge overlong cornball Armageddon - a work of shlock and awe. In one scene Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is seen on TV declaring that ""Da vurst iss ofah but he couldnt be more wrong.

In the new thriller 2012 those lunar or just lunatic prophesies come true. ""Its kind of galling"" says a previously skeptical White House pooh-bah (Oliver Platt) ""when you realize that the nutbags with the cardboard signs were right all along."" The nutbag with the 250 million budget is director and co-writer Roland Emmerich who for all his deficiencies as a teller of stories and wrangler of actors can never be accused of thinking small. In Independence Day he had Martians attack Earth; in The Day After Tomorrow global warming triggers an instant ice age. He is both the king of disaster porn and a sentimental elitist his movies kill off billions of humans so that one family can get back together. Emmerich tinkers with Darwins law so that its the survival of the top-billed. (See flying saucers in film.) Chugging laboriously on several parallel tracks the movie starts with noted scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) trying to get news of the bleak 2012 scenario to higher-ups including President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover the first African-American actor to play a U.S. Commander in Chief since Barack Obama assumed the post). Several billionaires are asked to contribute their fortunes to some mysterious endeavor that will save the world or possibly just themselves. Meanwhile on a peak in Yelllowstone Park a crazy radio prophet (Woody Harrelson) is warning of an imminent Armageddon. And failed novelist Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is reunited with his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and two kids while they barely avoid the catastrophes befalling virtually everyone else on the planet. Youll quickly glean that Jacksons job is to be an ordinary guy who evolves into an end-of-days Messiah. (Can it be a coincidence that both the actor and his character have the initials J.C.?) 2012 -- and by the way how is the title to be pronounced? Two thousand twelve (like A Space Odyssey)? Twenty-twelve? Two-zero-one-two? -- is a dead-serious hoot. In some scenes when folks are spouting dewy end-of-days sentiments as if theyre contending for the Couldnt Be More Noble prize youll need to stitch your lips together to keep from laughing out loud. The movie dawdles when straining to make the cardboard characters become flesh and blood. Why bother? Thats not what were here for; we want to see what the end of the world looks like in case were not around for the real thing. (See TIMEs photo-essay ""The Fascinating World of J.J. Abrams."") So when a California governor in the Schwarzenegger mold goes on TV to proclaim ""The worst is over"" wed be disappointed if the whole state didnt immediately collapse in a crazy quilt of fault lines. In a disaster movie of the 2012 stripe lines of complacent dialogue are like song cues in a musical heralds of gigantic production numbers. The only difference is that instead of dancing chorines 2012 offers orgies of destruction some of which blithely recall 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. If you can tamp down the ""How dare they?"" impulse youll find the movies only scintillating scenes the Curtis familys escape in a van through L.A. streets that cave in two seconds after Jackson careers over them and a ride in a small plane that somehow flies between two downtown skyscrapers at the moment they collapse toward each other. Each boast effects work that is technically sophisticated dramatically cheesy and kinetically irresistible. (These two thrillathon sequences can be found on Aint It Cool News.) For all the logorrhea of the dialogue scenes the movie can be brutally brisk when it wants to. Note how it dispenses with the complete works of Dan Brown in a few blunt strokes the Mona Lisa is stolen from the Louvre Vatican City is destroyed Washingtons masonry crumbles. The closing credits announce that the movie was inspired in part by the book Footprints of the Gods a pseudoscience tome that cites Charles Hapgoods 1958 theory of Earth Crust Displacement. (If you care go to Wikipedia.) But the true inspirers of 2012 are the disaster movies -- nearly all the disaster movies -- that preceded it. Theres the giant wall of water from The Poseidon Adventure the apocalyptic ark from Evan Almighty the panoramas of devastation and dad-and-son bonding from Spielbergs War of the Worlds and the notion of prominent people getting a ticket out of the disaster from both Dr. Strangelove and the 1951 film When Worlds Collide. That early sci-fi movie provides many of 2012s plot tropes including the rioting of those meant to be left behind the death of the richest meanest man on earth and the ultimate salvation of cute kids and a pet pooch. No I didnt spill too much of the plot beans. Any sentient viewer will be able to predict every lumpy twist of this ludicrous fitfully enjoyable movie. As for the original Mayan prediction I have my suspicions that its bogus but Im reluctant to blow off the whole idea. Get back to me on Dec. 22 2012.

This may be the ultimate achievement of his career. Its certainly hard to top. Hes destroyed every corner of the planet as though the map has folded in on itself--Mount Everest is taken down by a flood. The cause is Mayan-predicted scientist-extrapolated nonsense that translates to the sun is melting the earths crust. Thats bad. Global leaders have had short warning and theyve used it to build secret arks to house themselves great works of art assorted zoo creatures and whatever plebeians can afford the 1 billion Euro fare. (Nice dis on the dollar.) Emmerich and co-writer Harald Kloser are passingly interested in the philosophy of merit art and human worth (Da Vinci is on board; the Chinese ark builders arent.)--but hes focused on wrecking the world and its wicked fun. The actors are tools and they know it but John Cusack Amanda Peet Thandie Newton Danny Glover Chiwetel Ejiofor and Oliver Platt are good enough sports--and talents--that they at least try to hold their own against the lava balls. Their escapes are wholly ridiculous excuses for applause particularly the first-car-then-plane near-miss tear out of Los Angeles as the Pacific Coast crumbles away. I wont justify the cornball dialogue or get into the thorny debate over whether a good dumb movie disqualifies itself by striving to be dumb. Any critic who decries Emmerich for slaughtering people for kicks has a point. (And it may be even worse that he first tries to make us like them.) But this blockbuster set a goal and slamdunked it squeezing in so much entertainment that by the credits Id forgotten about Woody Harrelsons turn as a pickle-chomping AM radio meteorological messiah. And then I remembered. And then I smiled. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Having exhausted the commercial potential of crystals and angels--so 80s and 90s respectively--the New Age industry has spent much of this decade sounding the siren about the year 2012. A date of great significance on the Mayan Long Count Calendar for those who choose to look at it a certain way 2012 will either bring about the end of the world or usher in a new era of human consciousness greater understanding between nations talking ponies ice-cream fountains random acts of kindness and spontaneous bursts of music from the Windham Hill catalog. Guess which one director Roland Emmerich chose to portray in 2012? Since Independence Day Emmerich has made a career of taking down familiar landmarks. He stuck grabby images of that destruction into the trailers for his movies Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow hoping audiences would show up to see what was in between. Sure there were a couple of asides into pseudo-history in the form of The Patriot and 10000 BC but these now look like breath-catching exercises. Emmerich is here to destroy the world. In 2012 the disaster is caused by some combination of Mayan prophecy sun flares neutrinos and the Earths fragile crust. Or something. The movie isnt terribly concerned about causes. It also isnt particularly concerned about effects. Opening in 2009 it follows brilliant scientist Chiwetel Ejiofor as he uncovers the horrible truth about the earths impending doom then relays it to president Danny Glover. Glover is thus saddled with a horrible problem How to preserve the human species even though life as we know it is about to end. The film on the other hand takes on no such burden letting the plan to offer refuge from the apocalypse to the chosen and the wealthy pass without a lot of hand-wringing. Instead it shifts the focus to struggling author John Cusack as he becomes aware of the coming disaster and desperately attempts to save his family. Because whats a few billion corpses when a photogenic lead is at stake? Like a blockbuster updating of a Twilight Zone episode only with explosions instead of all that sticky moral questioning 2012 is ultimately only about finding new ways to topple monoliths. Only they dont feel that new. Independence Day began a game of landmark-destroying one-upmanship. Here Emmerich takes the competition global but the soundtracks organ-rattling low-end makes a deeper impact than the films visuals. He already took out the White House 13 years ago so the second time around doesnt feel so shocking particularly in the middle of a movie already overstuffed with go-nowhere subplots lurching toward a final act lifted from a movie that cant be named without spoiling the plots one surprise. (Okay its Titanic. But as the floodwaters start to rise it wouldnt take the prophetic skills of the ancient Mayans to figure that out.)

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Nov. 12 2009(out of 4)Starring John Cusack Amanda Peet Chiwetel Ejiofor and Oliver Platt. Directed by Roland Emmerich. 158 minutes. Midnight tonight at AMC Yonge-Dundas Courtney Park opening wide Friday. 14ANobody expects Shakespeare from an end-of-days spectacle but the dark-and-stormy-night howlers delivered by 2012s scenery-chewing cast means theres more disasters than just the natural variety exploding onscreen.Perhaps writer-director Roland Emmerich was hoping for a so-bad-its-good cult status with his latest disaster flick. Over-the-top dialogue has always been a satisfying part of these popcorn munchers but the clunky script and kitchen-sink approach to Emmerichs global apocalypse tale landing in select theatres Thursday at midnight and opening wide Friday makes the movie fail on a bunch of fronts.At a derriere-numbing 2 1/2 hours-plus the lightning-paced demolition scenes are sandwiched between long and boring stretches that will leave audiences tapping their toes and wishing that something would just erupt for heavens sake.Article Continued BelowThe movies scale is so gargantuan even compared to Emmerichs previous offerings Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow that the resulting tanking of 2012 is absolutely spectacular. This one even outdoes his turkey trot Godzilla.Rumoured to cost some 260 million (U.S.) - figure most of it went for CGI - 2012 liberally lifts from the Irwin Allen playbook especially The Poseidon Adventure right down to the cruise ship turned turtle by a gigantic tsunami. Titanic and When Worlds Collide are similarly strip-mined. Theres a lot of time spent setting up the story which makes some sloppy turns and leaves several threads hanging. The gist is the legend that the Maya calendar runs out Dec.21 2012 signalling the end of the world. In India a revelation by a geologist that solar eclipses are heating the Earths core to the point that the crust will shift dramatically gets world leaders attention. The forecast for 2012 some two years hence is massive earthquakes followed by huge tsunamis.Egghead geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) gets the White House involved after staring at his laptop and whispering ""My God."" So you know its serious.Helmsley knows the end is coming and it wont be pretty. He needs to convince the president (a wooden Danny Glover) and his power-mad chief of staff Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) that theyd better get the world ready to face the music. Instead the world leaders decide to keep things on the down-low and spend the two years mankind has left building a flotilla of gigantic arks in a hidden location to save those deemed worthy by dint of genetics or chequebook weight.That means sad-sack failed writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) has to get off the couch and save the world.Split from his wife Kate (Amanda Peet) Jackson is feeling his currency as a parent slide ever since Kate has found a new love a plastic surgeon who wears scrubs all the time even to bring in the morning paper.Theres an astonishing amount of crossover in 2012 as amusing coincidences keep piling up. There may be more than 6 billion people on the planet but the two-dozen cast members all either work together on projects around the world are having an affair or are related.With all this going on - and more - it takes Emmerich a frustrating amount of time to get to the digital eye candy. The destruction of California kicks it off with an airborne escape that will set thrill-ride designers hearts a-flutter.Emmerich then flattens Rio mashes Rome bombards Yellowstone and wipes out the White House in an orgy of CGI trickery. You want religious symbolism? How about splitting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel right down the middle of creation? But it all soon grows wearying. In between the global smackdowns fire raining from the skies and people falling out of buildings the story drags on. Watching Cusack dodge death a dozen times makes the exercise pointless and predictable.Theres not much hope offered and by the two-hour mark you cant be blamed for wishing either the movie - or the world - would hurry up and end.Only Woody Harrelson as a wild-eyed survivalist running a pirate radio station out of his trailer makes an impression and his screen time is far too short. Theres a none-too-subtle message when a character seeking escape from the destruction flips the bird out a closing door. It could also be Emmerich giving the finger to critics who will doubtless judge 2012 harshly.Disaster movies work when we climb aboard for the ride armed with a message about the resilient human spirit. But the worldview here as seen by Emmerich is just bleak.""What did you think we were going to do? Hold hands and sing `Kumbaya?"" Platts character scoffs.Only if you keep it short.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsSquadGoals Will Smith Margot Robbie on Suicide Squad red carpet in TorontoToronto mayor John Tory showed up to thank the stars for shooting the summer tent-pole movie in the city.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"2012 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 2012 ) 2012 (United States/Canada 2009) November 11 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli If as is believed in certain fringe circles the world will come to an end in 2012 at least there will be no more movies like this one made. Perhaps the strangest thing about 2012 is that the bad parts of the film are among the most enjoyable because theyre so over-the-top ridiculous that its impossible not to break out laughing. Its the mediocre sections that bring the production down and there are far too many of them. Despite having only enough content to adequately fill a 60-minute slot 2012 turns into an epic slog of more than 2 1/2 hours. It seems a lot longer. Load up on strong coffee beforehand. Not only will that be needed to keep you awake but it will provide a bathroom break excuse to escape the theater once or twice. Of course once free of the auditorium you may find the lure of the exit door too sweet to pass up. The idea that the apocalypse is set for December 21 2012 isnt a new one. Doomsayers always looking for the next possible date for the planets destruction have latched onto this one because it represents the end of the Mayan calendar. Im sure Nostradamus predicted it as well because the poor guy gets credit for predicting everything. Count me among the skeptics and not just because theres no credible scientific evidence to support a 2012 lights-out but because the true believers preach it with a religious fervor thats a little scary. I wont lose any sleep over it and feel confident that the world will be pretty much the same when I wake up on December 22 2012 as it will be the day before. I wont be postponing shopping for Christmas presents in the hope that the end of the world will save me the agony. I cant say whether the so-called ""science"" represented in Roland Emmerichs 2012 is the most embarrassing misrepresentation of geology physics and astronomy ever offered in a big-budget movie but it has to be close. This shouldnt be surprising however since Emmerich is far less interested in staying true to the laws of the physical world than he is in destroying things. With 2012 he aims not only to top his own previous excesses (which include Independence Day Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow) but to out-explode Michael Bay and steal the disaster crown from Irwin Allen. Pretty much every kind of imaginable catastrophe can be found in this film. Earthquakes? Check. Volcanos? Check. Collapsing skyscrapers? Check. Uncontrolled fires? Check. Raining ash? Check. Plane crashes? Check. Capsized ocean liners? Check. Tsunamis? Check. John Cusack as an action hero? Check - say anything but not that Of course the average movie-goer conned out of 10 to see this movie will not care about characters which is a good thing because there arent any. And he or she wont care about a storyline which is also a good thing. No - the driving motivation for anyone to see 2012 is mayhem. Things blowing up. A shitstorm of special effects. So does that aspect of the movie at least live up to expectations? Sadly no. Yes there are some impressive scenes of havoc but theyre not as spectacular as one expects. And theres a disappointing lack of recognizable icons biting the dust. The city whose destruction is chronicled in the most detail is Los Angeles which is arguably one of the most structurally generic cities in the United States. No Empire State Building. No Sears Tower. No Space Needle. Washington D.C. Las Vegas Buenos Ares and the Vatican get token screen time but those are almost afterthoughts. I assume Emmerich decided not to go after New York this time because hes already traveled that route and it may seem less-than-entertaining after the real-life horrors of 9/11. Another problem with the disaster sequences is that they last too long are too repetitive and are mixed with some of the most preposterous action scenes ever devised for a motion picture. Not only are we treated to the astonishing sight of a limousine being chased by the cracking and buckling of streets during the earthquake that destroys Pasadena but thats only the appetizer for when our heroes flee the pyroclastic flow created by the Yellowstone super-volcano (by RV foot and plane). This reduces the concept of outrunning a fireball to the level of a nursery school feat. Some degree of silliness is expected in a big-budget disaster movie but what happens in 2012 is so over-the-top that its impossible for a thinking person to dismiss the absurdity of the situation. 2012 follows the traditional disaster film formula first act setup (in which various dire pronouncements are made about the future of the human race) second act payoff (in which 75% of the special effects budget is exhausted) and final act resolution (in which the heroes do heroic things that save the human race or at least part of it). Theres a large roster of characters which truncates the screen time of them all and destroys any chance of someone emerging as more than a foreground decoration for the special effects. Theres no suspense because one doesnt care whether the characters live or die. Their fates are a matter of indifference which makes all the ""excitement"" near the end rather ho-hum. The first significant person were introduced to is Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a scientific advisor to the President (Danny Glover). He is the bearer of bad news during a recent trip to India he uncovered evidence that the world is on the fast track to destruction. Its 2009 when he makes this discovery; three years later his prediction is reaching fruition. Hes one of the leaders of an international team assembled to investigate the problem and develop a solution by which the human race will not end. His immediate superior is Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) who is prepared to take emotion out of the equation when it comes to who lives and dies - something Adrian the President and the First Daughter (Thandie Newton) cant do. As the destabilization of the planet accelerates plans have to be adjusted. Meanwhile Los Angeles-based fiction writer Jackson Curtis (Cusack) is on vacation in Yosemite with his two kids when news of a massive earthquake in the city causes him to head home but not before he has a heart-to-heart with an Art Bell-type radio show host Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson). Charlie informs Jackson that the world is about to end. He gives him the whole spiel about the Mayans and December 21. (Although curiously the events in this film seem to take place during the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2012 not during the last fortnight of the year.) Jackson and his kids arrive at the house shared by his ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and her plastic surgeon boyfriend Gordon (Tom McCarthy) just as the final dissolution of Los Angeles is beginning. So everyone hops in Jacksons limo and they get the hell out of Dodge. Their destination is Yellowstone where Charlie claims to have ""maps"" of the ""space ships"" being designed by the government to save humanity. There are other characters too - an Indian geophysicist a pair of old coots on a cruise ship and some people in Tibet - but they have even less to do than the main group. The cast is more formidable than one might expect from a glorified B-movie. Clearly the actors knowing the identity of the director and having read the script could not have been under the misapprehension they were embarking upon the second coming of Citizen Kane. Yet Emmerich managed to nab the usually reliable John Cusack Oliver Platt and Danny Glover the ethereal Thandie Newton the increasingly prominent Woody Harrelson and quirky character actor Chiwetel Ejiofor. One can assume that looking at the cast list for 2012 may provide insight into whose portfolio was damaged in the 2008 stock market dive. Apparently the start of production for 2012 was impacted by the writers strike. In ordinary circumstances that might provide a partial explanation for the poor quality of the screenplay but the reality is that movies of this sort are generally not blessed with top-notch writing. Scripts are nothing more than skeletons. The flesh and muscle are the visual effects and when these are found wanting as is sometimes the case during 2012 the production resembles a picked-over carcass. When it comes to disaster movies Im an easy mark - I liked dumb fare like Twister Volcano and The Day After Tomorrow. But I cant give 2012 a pass.

I quite enjoyed the experience at least the first five or six hours of it. ""2012"" is not simply the last disaster movie you ever need to see. Its the last movie you ever need to see.Objectively considered it is pretty dire both in its narrative speculations (owing to the Mayan calendar foretelling a dicey near-future for us all) and in its merry defiance of every reasonable standard of storytelling quality. But film like film criticism concerns more than mere objective truths. ""2012"" which samples everything from ""Earthquake"" to ""The Perfect Storm"" to ""The Towering Inferno"" to the Bible will appeal to the baser instincts in anyone who lapped up Emmerichs schlocktastic ""10000 B.C."" Which makes one of us at least.So the people were supposed to care about John Cusack plays a struggling writer and part-time limo driver whose ex-wife (Amanda Peet) is dating a plastic surgeon (Tom McCarthy) who has a pilots license. This comes in handy indeed once these uneasily blended family units get together and skedaddle out of L.A. just as L.A. is doing its big deathbed scene.Meantime the president (Danny Glover) and his daughter (Thandie Newton) and the presidents oily adviser (Oliver Platt who comes pre-oiled) are being briefed by the only man on the planet who knows whats going on with the sun and the neutrinos and the Earths core and the heating and flooding problems and the shaking and the waves and the drowning everywhere. The scientist is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor who periodically throws the movie out of whack simply because hes such a good actor.Behind the wheel of his limo Cusacks character outruns an earthquake clear across Hollywood which makes for a pretty good sight gag. (The special effects are on the B-minus/B-plus level of impressive which makes them more fun somehow.) The surgeon in a small plane carrying the sympathetic ones who will never die outruns a quake of his own at the Vegas airport. Up in Yellowstone National Park Woody Harrelson plays a tetched radio host who knows whats coming and who has no interest in outrunning anything. In an Emmerich film this makes him both more and less than human.No one cares more about our planet than Emmerich who wrote the ""2012"" script with Harald Kloser. He cares because he has so many ways to get rid of it to level its landmarks ix-nay its inhabitants and erase entire continents even. As a moralist he is true-blue Hell slaughter digitized extras by the thousands as the Earths core heats up and the flood waters rise and the earthquake fissures fish but hell devote several minutes of screen time to  a dislikable little dogs fate in the face of the biggest tsunami ever just as its about to cream Mount Everest. The script is so brazen about its cliche-deployment you half-expect O.J. Simpsons character from ""The Towering Inferno"" to show up and save a kitten. Then again by this point in what the old folks call the ""story"" the canine rescue is no big whoop; weve already seen it all twice. ""2012"" goes on so much longer than it should even its third-act endlessness becomes sort of entrancing. You can keep your Michael Bay with his Transformers. For visual noise by the ton Emmerich is my kind of hack the pluperfect blend of leaden self-seriousness and accidental-on-purpose self-satirist. mjphillipstribune.com Related""2012"" photos 10 underrated depictions of the apocalypse Video Michael Phillips reviews ""2012""MPAA rating PG-13 (for intense disaster sequences and some language)Cast John Cusack (Jackson Curtis); Chiwetel Ejiofor (Adrian Helmsley); Amanda Peet (Kate Curtis); Oliver Platt (Carl Anheuser); Thandie Newton (Laura Wilson); Tom McCarthy (Gordon Silberman); George Segal (Tony Delgatto); Danny Glover (President Wilson); Woody Harrelson (Charlie Frost)Credits Directed by Roland Emmerich; written by Harald Kloser and Emmerich; produced by Kloser Mark Gordon and Larry Franco.

Love to see the conversion of imaginary work into an act This all will happen in 2012................................... Prepare to pass through the disaster Posted by Rehan | November 23 2009 at 1009 AM Witty review. I like your sense of humor. Let me start off by telling you that I am not a big fan of disaster movies and if I wasnt reviewing 2012 myself I probably wouldnt have seen it. That being said let me also tell you that if you ARE a fan of disaster movies you are going to LOVE this one. The special effects and disaster scenes are unbelievably amazing. 2012 is over-the-top and fun...and who says thats always a bad thing? Posted by Kate | November 21 2009 at 0932 AM I wasnt planning on seeing this movie thanks to its mixed mediocre reviews on Movie Review Intelligence (http//moviereviewintelligence.com/index.aspx?BID=27amp;RID=705amp;CID=0) but I dont think I can resist the lure of a big blockbuster with great effects that all my friends seem to have loved. Great review LOVED your opening about ""Aquarius"". Posted by Kristal | November 17 2009 at 0321 PM I actally liked the movie Great special effects Posted by Ramona | November 17 2009 at 0157 AM Just got home from seeing the movie.....I love John Cusack and acpocalyptic movies so I was sold before I got there. It was a real vat-of-popcorn edge of your seat thriller from start to finish I loved it People can say what they will about it being overdone. Hey it was a wild roller-coaster ride that never let up with just enough human interest to keep it moving. For 2.5 hrs I forgot all my problems and was immersed in the end of the world with my favorite actor John Cusack. Well worth the money. I likes your review very much too Posted by TJF | November 16 2009 at 1026 PM if You seen Deep Impact and Day after Tomorrow guess what youve seen 2012. Special effects good but lets be honest you will not out fly a volcano ash cloud. For those that dont believe me watch National Geography on this matter. Also Hollywood should had stay more to the Mayans and Nostradamus 2012 prediction. The most believe aspect was that the world leaders sold seats to be on the Arks too the rich of course. Again hollywood will make their money back and some but the movie goers I feel was cheated again. 2 and half star. Posted by REGGIE TOWNSEND | November 16 2009 at 1010 AM The movie is of course fiction. If anyone wants to explore the various 2012 prophecies and relevant science they should check out all the History Channel programs on this subject and visit the 2012 section at thecityedition.com which contains a fairly comprehensive compilation of articles and websites. Posted by YRM | November 13 2009 at 0836 PM I cracked up reading the paper today (yes I still read actual printed media on occasion call me old school). I immediately felt compelled to tell you I loved your review. Wasnt planning on seeing ""2012"" but now I feel that I must as it sounds like a great time. Posted by Mary Farmer | November 13 2009 at 0650 PM I just laughed out loud 3 times reading your 2012 review on the El train home. A brilliant bit of writing. Thank you Posted by Hal Weitzman | November 13 2009 at 0521 PM Your review of 2012 is the most fun review I have ever read (and Ive read thousands). Thank you for brightening my day. Posted by Barbara | November 13 2009 at 0246 PM Singularly fine writing I dont know when Ive experienced a greater appreciation for fine schlock. Bravo Posted by Petronillus | November 13 2009 at 1040 AM Haha excellent review Mr. Phillips. Well done Posted by Jordan W. | November 12 2009 at 0911 PM If this movie is worth 3 stars then I hope the 2012 prophecy comes true. Posted by Wacker Chia Pet | November 12 2009 at 0740 PM great review Posted by yomann | November 12 2009 at 0520 PM If Cusack continues to get leading roles the end of the world cant get here soon enough. Posted by Idieman | November 12 2009 at 0428 PM This is a fantastic review. Great writing Posted by kyle | November 12 2009 at 0339 PM And nobody yet has picked up that this is the movie When Worlds Collide? Posted by MarkRG | November 12 2009 at 0307 PM Did you put the 3 stars on the wrong movie? or did you not read what you wrote? Posted by DW | November 12 2009 at 0130 PM I dont understand and am shocked you liked this movie. Isnt this like transformers without robots? You know there will be a silly stupid story with lots of plot holes bad dialogue and the same cast of characters in every disaster movie. Yet it will be overshadowed but tons of explosions noises special effects and CGI and you give it three stars? Not to mention that there is something weird about thinking its cool and entertaining watching billions of fictional people die. Fans of this movie watch the news. Youll get your real-life fix quick. I might add that on rotten tomatoes.com only you and Ebert have given this a good review. Posted by Hm | November 12 2009 at 0115 PM No he gave it three stars because its so entertaining and _only_ three because its so bad. Nice to have a critic whos willing to settle for Entertainment as opposed to Art when called for. Posted by Calidore | November 12 2009 at 1257 PM Im usually the first one in line for a disaster picture (I own ""Towering Inferno"" ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (original) and ""Earthquake"") because I love adventure stories. But this one kinda frightens me. Maybe its because a tiny part of me wonders whether it will come true; whereas I most likely will never be caught in a burning skyscraper or upside-down cruise ship. Its the same reason I wont watch ""The Day After"" (1984) I guess they hit a little too close to him. Posted by Kelly | November 12 2009 at 1215 PM Thanks for that review because you just saved me 3.50 (senior rate in Farmington) and their popcorn is pretty lousy. Posted by Terry | November 12 2009 at 1157 AM well how long is it? Editors note Cast box has it at 238. Posted by Jon | November 12 2009 at 1152 AM ""with the sun and the neutrinos and the Earths core and the heating and flooding problems and the shaking and the waves and the drowning everywhere"" - very Prof. Frink.

The sun is at it again in 2012 although we are not going down so quickly this time. There are times when 2012 feels as if it is not going to end until 2012 - or at least until director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day Godzilla The Day After Tomorrow) who has an insatiable appetite for destruction and blowing up historical monuments has come up with yet another new way of obliterating the White House. (Ive got it Lets have the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier plow into it Trust me guys thisll work). 2012 is a movie designed to make Irwin Allen seem like a girly-man - a movie designed to make every other disaster picture ever made seem as if it had been shot on cardboard sets on a budget of 10. This is Earthquake The Poseidon Adventure Volcano and all those Airport movies rolled into one insane eye-popping spectacle and the film certainly delivers everything it promises. You have never seen special effects like these. You have also never seen so many movie characters running around shouting ""Thats impossible ""My . . . God ""What is happening?"" and ""Are you absolutely sure about this?"" - which is probably exactly what people would be saying if the Earths core began melting the ground started caving in placid lakes suddenly sprouted giant volcanoes and Bill OReilly went Democrat. And to their credit Emmerich and co-writer Harald Kloser (no doubt the cinemas first film-composer-turned-screenwriter) have made some 2012 protagonists much more engaging than the characters who normally populate this kind of fare. There is Jackson (John Cusack) a failed writer and failed husband trying to maintain a bond with ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and their two young children. Tom McCarthy the accomplished director of The Station Agent and The Visitor does more than most actors would with the role of Kates new boyfriendwho happens to have taken a few flying lessons in his spare time (never has a hobby become handier). The boomy-voiced Zlatko Buric is terrific as a Russian billionaire who like many of the worlds wealthiest people knew about the impending apocalypse and has made expensive preparations to survive. And Chiwetel Ejiofor as the government scientist who first warns the President (Danny Glover) about whats about to go down brings an air of dignity and class the movie really does not deserve. But enough about all this boring acting nonsense. 2012 aint Shakespeare and Emmerich is only interested in people in terms of how they look falling from buildings or being squashed by toppling statues. There are seven or eight big setpieces but none beats the destruction of Los Angeles by a 10.5 earthquake with Jackson barrelling down the streets in a limo with his family the city raining down on their heads. The sequence is stunning - you cant wait for the DVD so you can break it down frame-by-frame - and there are several other scenes almost as good in which characters stare in horrified awe at a giant wall of lava a tidal wave or Oliver Platts overacting as the presidents chief of staff one of those characters who like many newspaper editors are always inexplicably angry and short-tempered for no apparent reason. 2012 which runs almost three hours would have been better (and a lot shorter) if Emmerich hadnt come up with a creaky third act in which he figures out a way to ensure that mankind wont be completely wiped out. The last 40 minutes test your patience - and intelligence - in a way the rest of this big dumb crazy movie never does The film starts taking itself too seriously. I liked 2012 better when people were running around shouting ""The Mayans saw this coming which come to think of it also happened in Knowing. Who says there are no original ideas left in Hollywood? 2012 opens in South Florida on Friday Nov. 13.

Co-writer Harald Kloser (no doubt the cinemas first composer-turned-screenwriter)....well Im not sure HOW many there have been but heres an easy one to mention to show Kloser is NOT the first - Joseph Stefano who wrote the screenplay for the iconic Hitchcock film ""Psycho."" He indeed began his career as a composer of pop music in the 1940s writing songs for Las Vegas showman Donn Arden. Ah the ease with which the internet allows the unearthing of obscure facts Posted by Robbie Rosenberg | November 11 2009 at 0126 PM I meant a film composer who became a screenwriter not just someone who wrote music and also wrote screenplays. Im sure there have been many of those. Robert Rodriguez for example scores most of his own movies. Posted by Rene Rodriguez | November 11 2009 at 0150 PM Lets hope the real thing happens in 2012. I had enough of this place. Posted by Richard | November 11 2009 at 0612 PM Danny Glover a self proclaimed communist as President of the US. WOW another reason why I wont go see this movie its very similar to what is happening now. Posted by El Chicharron | November 11 2009 at 1034 PM OK giving it a pass. Another of Emmerichs badly paced efforts. Did he skip class theday the storytelling teacher explained about building up to a big finish? Seems that way given how he goes all out in the middle then peters out at the end. Posted by S. Wolf | November 12 2009 at 1008 AM There is hype and truth about 2012 even some doom and gloom.

Posted by Jess | November 12 2009 at 0633 PM I thought the movie 2012 was total eye candy...I was entertained even though the main stars unrealistcally survived by bolting out of California on a thin string when it was crumbling into the Pacific. I dont believe the 2012 hype of the end of the world. Not not saying that there isnt any truth to the predictions just not all the prediction. What I believe is the bible prophecy and according to the bible not even the Son himself knows when the end will come. Just my opinion...I loved the movie anyhow had me on the edge of my chair....P.S modern day Noah Ark was something...WoW Posted by Kisses | November 14 2009 at 1141 PM great post. thank for share. I really need something like this. and dont forget to pay a visit here Posted by rangers | November 28 2009 at 0718 AM I gotta say first of all anybody hating on the acting or the obviously unrelenting predictability of the plot in this movie should really just stop being such snobs about movies like this. Sure we all know that in reality their aint no way that anybody is gonna go speeding through Los angeles in a damn limo fly a plane to vegas hop on another plane drive a car out of the back of a moving cargo plane narrowly escaping imminent disaster in all of these situations and somehow manage to be one of the few survivors to make it on to the ship? Of course its ridiculous but Im sorry I was under the impression that thats why we watch movies. Thats why we watch Television. Reality sucks. We want to emmerse ourselves in worlds where you can drive through a collapsing building in a limo and escape death and these things are possible. Get lives mother fuckers and stop hating for real. Ill tell you right now that movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time the acting was more than sufficient for the movie and the ending was adequate. Unless your some critical jerk off with nothing better to do than criticize other people to make yourselves feel better I would definitley reccomend this movie. Posted by Random | December 16 2009 at 0433 PM ""Unless your some critical jerk off with nothing better to do than criticize other people to make yourselves feel bette...."" yes that is precisly the reason I dindt like 2012. It totally made my day. I wanted to make myself feel better. Having a different opinion than yours had nothing to do with it whatsoever;. Posted by Rene Rodriguez | December 17 2009 at 1203 AM It is very small minded of you to knock The Princess and the Frog due to the fact it is traditional 2D animation. Not everything looks good in CGI nor is translated as such and vice versa. It features beautiful animation a fun all ages tale and a movie overall that Walt Disney himself may be proud of. If it doesnt do well it is because sadly people like you who cant see past Pixar or people who are too busy using ""your"" for ""youre"" as they type something hateful to someones video on YouTube. Posted by Matthew Grayson | December 24 2009 at 1103 AM When I saw the trailer I was very excited to watch it. But I was disappointed. True the film was very eyecandy. It had really state of the art special effects but I think theres something missing. Great review. I think it summarize everything about 2012.

Cast John Cusack Amanda Peet Chiwetel Ejiofor. Rating Rated PG-13 for intense disaster sequences and some language. RELATED Spotlight John Cusack Movies about the apocalypse Best special effects movies In Roland Emmerichs world the fleet can flee disaster You will too after seeing ""2012"" director Roland Emmerichs monstrously over-the-top end-of-the-world epic. Nothing is enough for Emmerich. The movie is too long the special effects too brazen the coincidences too jaw-dropping the story too ridiculous. After 158 minutes of watching continents flood cities sink and an aircraft carrier destroy the White House - by landing on top of it () - you wont want popcorn. Youll want an aspirin. It all ties in with end-of-the-world prophecies and predictions - end of the Mayan calendar Nostradamus solar activity cranking up to the boiling point all that. Turns out at least in this telling that the worlds leaders have known about looming disaster for a while but they havent told anyone about it yet so as not to incur panic. Just as well probably because theyre wrong about everything they forecast. Meanwhile theyre working out an exit plan for bigwigs for when the bell finally tolls. Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is unaware of all this of course. Hes a struggling writer whose wife Kate (Amanda Peet) has left him and taken their two children with her. Shes now living with her boyfriend Gordon (Tom McCarthy) who what do you know has been taking pilot lessons. Wonder if thatll come in handy? (Note Were operating on the theory that spoilers are impossible for a movie whose premise is the end of the world.) Noble government scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) figures out that the end is being accelerated. Less-noble government honcho Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt who by the end of the film ought to have a mustache to twirl) is more of a pragmatist. Its a shame we cant save more people but the species must survive. That about sums up his feelings. U.S. President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) sides more with Helmsley but really does that even matter? As shaky as the science is the storytelling is worse. The special effects are stunning however particularly the destruction of cities. (For whatever reason tidal waves and tsunamis look less real.) Curtis takes his kids camping and runs into a conspiracy nut (Woody Harrelson born to it) who warns him whats about to happen. It takes only a few fissures to convince Curtis hes right so just in time he gets his wife her boyfriend and the kids out of town just as a massive earthquake hits - by outdriving it. Later and more than once Gordon will fly their way out of trouble zooming just ahead of massive destruction. After a chunk of California falls into the ocean and the rest of the world is similarly crumbling exploding or flooding President Wilson decides it might be a good time to let the nation know something bad is happening. Good idea. The special effects slow down long enough for a debate over the unfairness of who lives and dies. Heavy handed? Uh yeah. This is the kind of movie where when Rome gets it and the cracks and fissures first appear on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel they split the hands of God and Adam. Of course they do. If it sounds absurd thats because it is. But the effects are so unapologetically outlandish it almost rises to the level of guilty pleasure. Almost. ""We were warned"" the tagline for ""2012"" goes.

From Independence Day (1996) to The Day After Tomorrow (2004) taking down famous landmarks has become Emmerichs cinematic signature but ever since summer audiences cheered the White House being blown to bits by space aliens in the former demolished historic sites arent what they used to be.2012 is alien-free but there are tidal waves galore as well as earthquakes volcanic eruptions and blinding dust clouds all due to a sudden radical heating of the Earths core. A planetary realignment and an overstimulated sun are the villains in a scenario that a real-life seventh-century Mayan prophet is said to have predicted. So take note humans Life on Earth will end on December 12 2012. Plan your Christmas shopping accordingly.""Its kind of galling when you realize the nutbags with the cardboard signs had it right all along"" declares Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) chief of staff to the president (Danny Glover) as he watches news reports of panicked plebeians running from a shaking ground and thundering sky. Anheuser has been planning for the final day since 2009 when Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a mid-level government scientist thrusts a red-alert report into his hands at a fancy Washington party. Helmsleys dire warnings lead the worlds superpowers to band together and secretly build six giant ""arks"" designed to save the rich the powerful and the mostly white from Armageddon. Launch site ChinaAs if made by the gods to suffer for its movie-making sins Los Angeles is the first city to split apart and slide (literally) into the sea. In a ridiculous but bravura sequence Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) a failed sci-fi novelist/limo driver begins his long convoluted journey to China and those precious arks by dodging crumbling L.A. freeways and falling skyscrapers while his two kids ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and her new husband (Tom McCarthy) scream in the limousines backseat. The two-hour-and-40-minute 2012 is overstuffed with special-effects set-pieces but the Curtis familys mad dash out of town is the closest the movie gets to actually being fun if only because its easier to relate to a man navigating bad traffic than one trying to outrun a newly formed volcano.""How did they do that?"" is the question Hollywood always wants moviegoers to ask but in watching 2012 I couldnt help but wonder if todays audiences especially the very young ask that question as often as those of the past. When the ill-fated cruise ship of The Poseidon Adventure (1972)--a film Emmerich and co-writer Harald Kloser reference here more than once--was capsized by a tidal wave my 10-year-old self may have understood that flesh-and-blood stuntmen not actors were hanging off those upside-down cocktail tables but I still feared for them and by extension for the films characters. Todays CGI effects are undoubtedly more impressive but also more soul-numbing. Millions of people die in this movie--among them a few weve come to know--but not one of those deaths is affecting or memorable even in an overly sentimental B-movie way. Where is Shelley Winters when we need her?As with Emmerichs other films whats likely to linger in the public memory is a singular scene of iconic destruction that has been the centerpiece of the 2012 ad campaign The aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy after being swept up by a gigantic tidal wave flips over and comes crashing down--brief pause for irony--onto the White House. Goodbye Rose Garden. One wonders Is the disaster king suddenly getting political? Probably not. So for the widest audience possible we suggest that Columbia Pictures release an alternate take with the democracy-crushing aircraft carrier this time being the USS Ronald Reagan.

The notion of playing God is implicit in the job of a film director and rarely has the sense of a wrathful vengeful deity at the helm albeit a pagan one been so comprehensively felt as in ""2012."" For demolition maestro Roland Emmerich ""Independence Day"" ""Godzilla"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" were mere appetizers for the lip-smacking smorgasbord of global annihilation laid out here. This simultaneously spectacular and risible concoction looks likely to trigger a worldwide B.O. tsunami for Sony. Hooking their doomsday scenario on an interpretation of a Mayan calendar that points to an earthly catastrophe in 2012 -- specifically on 12-21-12 (what movie will pin its release to that date?) -- Emmerich and writing-producing partner Harald Kloser begin by dumping Los Angeles into the sea and follow with the destruction of Las Vegas Yellowstone National Park Washington D.C. the Vatican India Tibet and a giant cruise ship. Anyone who stops to think about it between grabs of popcorn might pick up the hint that Emmerich is taking particularly gleeful aim at the United States (which other director has destroyed the White House in his films not once but now twice?) and Catholicism (he goes out of his way to detail the collapse of St. Peters and Rios Christ the Redeemer statue) while no other religion gets taken to task. But then that would be taking this eye-popping display of movie pyrotechnics far too seriously. Or not. Coming up with halfway decent characters with which to populate disaster films has always proved an almost insurmountable problem but Kloser and Emmerich have brought a measure of wit to the enterprise. Pics Everyman is Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) a rumpled author whose most recent unsuccessful novel happens to have been called ""Farewell Atlantis"" and who never paid enough attention to sexy ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and their two young kids (Liam James and Morgan Lily). Hes now forced to look on as Kate shacks up with Gordon (Tom McCarthy) while he scrapes by as a limo driver for L.A.-based Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov (the very engaging Zlatko Buric). As SoCal hopes for the best amid an alarming upswing in tremors and cracked streets government scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) alerts U.S. President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover almost too predictably grave) that increased solar fires (happily for a change not man-made global warming) are about to turn the Earth inside out in a way not experienced since the day the dinosaurs died. While Wilsons chief of staff Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) readies the evacuation of the elite and the president deliberates about how to preside over the planets final chapter Curtis leads his kids on a series of escapes and near-misses worthy of Indiana Jones -- in a limo RV private plane (flown by nonpilot Gordon) giant Russian cargo jet and ultimately the biggest vehicle ever built. The action is preposterous by any standard but thats designed as part of the fun; eye-popping indeed are the sights of the streets of Santa Monica rippling like so many ocean waves molten meteors spewing out of Yellowstone the sea claiming a ship the size of a football field and a six-engine jet crash landing on a Himalayan glacier. Unfortunately its not easy scripting the final act of a movie about the end of the world when you dont really want the final image to be a charred rock. Let it be said that ""2012"" plummets from reasonably distracting spectacle to sheerest silliness when in the pointlessly protracted final reels it tries to maintain interest in the (confusingly staged) jeopardy of a handful of characters when much of the worlds population has already been wiped out or is about to be. Never has Ricks observation in ""Casablanca"" been more true that the problems of a few little people dont amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. On any level other than as sheer visual sensation ""2012"" is a joke for the simple reason that it has no point of view; the film offers no philosophical metaphysical intellectual and certainly no religious perspective on the cataclysm just the physical frenzy of it all. But to ask this would be taking the picture far too seriously. Or not. In Cusack and Ejiofor ""2012"" has two actors who convey above-the-norm intelligence for characters in this sort of fare although even they cant keep up the pretense as the film degenerates. Most casting choices are agreeably offbeat down through the ranks with Woody Harrelson supercharging his scenes as a wackjob radio sage who issues on-the-air reports from the front lines of destruction. Except for some patchy work when St. Peters crumbles the visual effects are pretty sensational delivering the cutting-edge CGI goods auds want and expect. It will be hard to watch ""Earthquake"" ever again after this one. 2012ProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures presentation of a Centropolis production.
