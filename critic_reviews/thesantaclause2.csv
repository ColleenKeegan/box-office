Yet film exudes a sense of exhaustion on their behalf as if those many scribes could barely pull this sure-fire sleigh across the screen. Arriving just in time for the renewed debate over the apportioning of screenwriting credits by the WGA ""The Santa Clause 2"" sports a whopping seven credited writers just two fewer than the number of Santas reindeer. Yet film exudes a sense of exhaustion on their behalf as if those many scribes could barely pull this sure-fire sleigh across the screen. But that wont matter much to pics target audience of tiny tots with their eyes all aglow; as the seasons first holiday-themed pic ""Santa Clause"" seems sure to gross north of the 1994 originals 100 million-plus domestic haul playing well through Christmas and the new year. But if ever more proof were needed that sequels arent equals. . . ""The Santa Clause"" (1994) was a runaway smash that launched the bigscreen career of Tim Allen. A full-on charmer pic told story of Allens character -- a divorced and somewhat irresponsible dad -- who ""became"" Santa Claus after inadvertently knocking the former one from his roof. A sequel was planned but because of the vagaries of the studio development process it is only just now arriving. And like so many other belated follow-ups (""Men in Black II"" most recently) that extra time has allowed for an inordinate number of writers and execs to take a hack at the material systematically pulverizing most of the originals simple delights. ""The Santa Clause 2"" is a movie conscious at every waking moment of trying to out-do its predecessor. Perhaps its not surprising then that theres enough material here for two or three (or four) movie sequels and that the disparate ideas never form a smooth assemblage. At the North Pole (an enormous if slightly gaudy set designed by Tony Burrough) its just 28 days until Christmas and smack in the thick of Santas busiest season. All is well until Santas head elf (David Krumholtz) informs Santa of a heretofore unknown stipulation in Santas employment contract the so-called ""Mrs."" Clause which states that Santa must take a bride by no later than Christmas Eve or Christmas will be canceled and Santa will be out of a job. Indeed the ""de-Santafication"" process which sees Santas appearance returning closer and closer to that of Scott Calvin (Allens civilian alter-ego) has already begun. But as nothing in ""The Santa Clause 2"" is nearly so simple the writers have concocted a second pressing dilemma for Santa/Scott Scotts teenage son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) has popped up on the dreaded ""naughty"" (as opposed to ""nice"") list after vandalizing his schools gymnasium. But wait theres more a subplot about Santa creating a toy clone of himself (also played by Allen) to keep things running at the Pole while hes taking care of the first two dilemmas. In this subplot Toy Santa becomes crazed and dictatorial trading in his Santa suit for a soldiers uniform and declaring that all children will receive only coal in their stockings this year. Reprising his role Allen is the burst of comic jet fuel that keeps this rickety enterprise watchable even if youre more than 4 years old. Allen projects a warm fatherly charisma but he can also be a manic comic force and his Toy Santa is arguably more menacing than the contract-killer Allen played earlier this year in ""Who Is Cletis Tout?"" But Allen is too good for this wanting material. Theres an almost-charming romance at the heart of ""The Santa Clause 2"" between Scott and Charlies school principal (Elizabeth Mitchell). And theres a borderline-cloying but ultimately quite touching scene in which Scott uses his Santa powers to provide the principal and all of her faculty with treasured mementos from their once-upon-a-time childhoods. But like all of pics pleasures these are fleeting ones as director Michael Lembecks pic is too restless to spend much time in any one place. Pic is festooned with cute mugging kids; lots of jazzy redos of beloved Christmas tunes on the soundtrack; and enough tug-at-your-heartstrings moments to make an entire theater feel warm on a blustery winter afternoon. Beyond which creature-effects maestros Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. (they have operated the ""Alien"" puppets in several films of that series) have out-done themselves designing the weight-fluctuating Santa his plastic clone and an assortment of new characters (including a life-size Easter Bunny). That may be enough no matter that so little of it resonates with any real feeling -- something that even a 4-year-old might pick up on.

The 90 minutes could be better spent doing holiday shopping. Its mystifying why Disney decided to release a sequel to The Santa Clause a whopping eight years after the original hit. Kids who liked it then are now teenagers and probably have cooler movies on their must-see lists. A new generation of children may not be familiar with the original story. That leaves parents who no doubt remember the first movie starring Tim Allen as a pleasant enough diversion. They will be disappointed that this follow-up is unquestionably a subordinate Clause -- making little sense standing on its own. Youll remember that Allen became the jolly old elf in the last movie and he has remained the white-bearded Santa presiding over a battalion of elves in his North Pole workshop. But Santas alter ego Scott Calvin is plagued by problems with his adolescent son Charlie (Eric Lloyd who also played the role of Allens son in the first film). Charlie has shown up on the dreaded ""naughty"" list. (Doesnt Santa himself make up that list? And if so shouldnt he recuse himself when it comes to judging his own children?) To make matters worse one of his sharpest helpers discovers a ""Mrs. Clause"" that requires him to get married by Christmas to remain Santa. Why did no one see this important fine print until now? Allen heads home to take care of business and find a missus. Left in charge is a temp Santa (also played by Allen) whose maniacal obsession with rules borders on fascism. This is the most ridiculous plot point of all The substitute Santa is a cruel despot who mobilizes his own SS-like army of toy soldiers. A Hitlerian dictator as Santa even a replacement one seems far too twisted for mass family consumption. The movie is saved from utter tedium by a chase scene involving the anti-Santa on the famous sleigh driven by Dasher Dancer et al. attempting to escape the real Santa whos riding a reindeer-in-training -- something a bit new in a movie that piles up tired ideas like presents under a Christmas tree. The trainee deer inexplicably named Chet is a cute computer-generated galloper that young ones should find appealing. For adults theres one scene in which Allen goes on the date from hell that might draw a laugh or two. Through the rest of the festivities you might want to claw your way out of the theater.

Starring Tim Allen Elizabeth Mitchell and Judge Reinhold. Written by Don Rhymer Cinco Paul Ken Daurio Ed Decter John J. Strauss Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick. Directed by Michael Lembeck. (G 97 minutes. At Bay Area Theaters.) Beneath all the padding and special effects there is something special in ""Santa Clause 2."" No not just Tim Allen as Santa Claus. Theres a nice little holiday movie in there somewhere too. As it stands this is way more movie than we actually need. There are plots subplots and sidetracks. Its a love story a father-son bonding tale and -- believe it or not -- a slam-bang knockout finish featuring body-slamming Santas. Come for the cute little elves; stick around for the high-speed sleigh crash. Allen is basically reversing his role from the 1994 hit ""The Santa Clause."" In that one he was an average guy transformed into the real Santa Claus. In the sequel hes settled into being Santa -- with a perfectly coifed Kenny Rogers look -- but has to turn himself back into the man he once was to save the day. Allen may not be on anyones Oscar short list -- so far his signature parts have been Santa and Buzz Lightyear -- but he still has a nice way with a punch line. Looking at the list of those who are ""naughty"" Santas elves direct him to a name on the list ""Charlie."" ""Sheen?"" Allen deadpans. ""I thought he straightened out."" No actually it is Charlie Calvin Santas teenage son left behind when dad packed up unexpectedly and took a job in manufacturing and distribution at the North Pole. Santa it turns out is another of those divorced absentee dads so busy with the job and a frantic travel schedule that he cant spend time with his kids. Charlie is staging a vague spray-painting protest against . . . something at the high school. Apparently has to do with there not being enough done to celebrate Christmas. Santa/dad has to rush back set Charlie straight and restore general Christmas cheer. Oh and while hes at it Santa must get married before Christmas just 28 days away or give up the job. Also theres a ticking watch measuring his magic powers while hes away and when it clicks down to zero something terrible will happen. Which .2 is not to mention the out-of-control cyborg-Santa that Allen and the elves have created to run the North Pole while he is gone. This caustic Claus (Allen again in another plastic mask) seems to have wandered in from a whole different movie. He turns into a paramilitary control freak shouting at the adorable elves knocking them flat in a football game and then creating an army of giant toy soldiers to enforce his orders. Where did that come from? Allens character runs energetically from one plot device to another. He bonds with Charlie romances the high school principal (Elizabeth Mitchell) hands out presents creates snow deals with a flatulent reindeer and comes back just in time to have a thrilling aerial battle with the pseudo Santa on a runaway sleigh. The whole thing has the look of a production that had nearly as many writers (seven) as Santa has reindeer. Certainly theres nothing wrong with keeping things moving. Kids probably will find it rip-roaring holiday fun and it is rated G to boot. But it is all over the place. When the Tooth Fairy airlifts Charlie in so he can rappel down a rope and help take out the anti-Santa you wonder if the youngsters will ever get their childhood mythology straight again. The Tooth Fairy fights crime? And wait until they see the closing scene when Santa winks at his new bride and warns her to rest up. When he gets back from Christmas he says with a jolly leer theres going to be ""a three-month honeymoon."" What did Santa mean by that? .

The Santa Clause 2 Movie Review (2002) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-santa-clause-2-2002,200,thesantaclause210,thesantaclause2,rogerebert
"CNN.com - Review Santa Clause 2 pleasant confection - Oct. 31 2002 CNN Europe CNN Asia Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese On CNN TV Transcripts Headline News CNN International About CNN.com Preferences Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Review Santa Clause 2 pleasant confection Nothing special but delivers the goods By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Tim Allen is Santa in ""The Santa Clause 2."" Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.COM  Movie reviews (CNN) -- Movie sequels may be like comfort food to movie studios but -- more often than not -- theyre iffy projects at best. A comedy sequel is even iffier but in ""Santa Clause 2"" Tim Allen delivers an utterly charming comedic confection. Once again Allens character Scott Calvin is the big man in the red suit living up at the North Pole. The films opening is a bit shaky but once Allen takes the front-and-center position in the story things begin to gel. Calvin it seems has trouble on two fronts. His son Charlie (Eric Lloyd also returning from the first film) is at loose ends trying to deal with the fact that his father is Santa Claus. He acts out at school is busted by his high school principal Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell) and ends up on Santas ""naughty"" list. But even closer to home -- at the North Pole -- is the fact that Calvins Santa contract has another clause. Its the ""Mrs."" Clause. It seems that unless Santa is married by midnight on Christmas Eve he will lose all his magical powers. Things going wrong Santa now has to be in two places at the same time. He needs to go home to help his son and find a wife. He also has to prepare for Christmas at the North Pole. To the rescue comes one of his elves who has invented a duplicating machine. They proceed to make a plastic Santa that will take his place at the North Pole while Calvin goes back to his former life. In ""The Santa Clause 2"" Allen woos a high school principal played by Elizabeth Mitchell. Of course everything and anything that can go wrong goes wrong. The plastic Santa turns into an evil dictator who wants to ruin Christmas and his son proves to be a tougher project than expected. Also the wife thing is a wee bit problematic too. Thank goodness theres a good-looking high school principal involved in the plot. John Pasquin directed the original ""Clause"" but this time out its TV comedy veteran Michael Lembeck (""Mad About You"" and ""Everyone Loves Raymond"") in charge making his feature film directing debut. He hasnt reinvented the wheel here. Mostly he just stays out of the way and lets the jokes flow aided by Allens impeccable timing. Holiday diversion Allen no matter how far you stretch your imagination is not a great actor. But he is a great comic and is wonderful at being Tim Allen. Hes perfectly suited and suited up for this role. The scenery props and costumes are all way over the top. But the film has no pretensions other then being exactly what it is a sweet slickly manufactured tale for the whole family a holiday diversion cut to fit everyone from 6 to 60. Will Charlie get on the ""nice"" list? Will Santa find a wife? Will the evil Santa succeed? Will Christmas be saved? Well what do you think? Well dramatic surprise isnt ""The Santa Clause 2s"" strong suit but the rest of the costume fits quite comfortably. ""The Santa Clause 2"" opens nationwide on Friday.

Now Santa needs to find a wife. While the usual polyester holiday cheer ensues a scene of Allen on a blind date with Molly Shannon is spiked eggnog for the boomer soul.

"Santa Clause 2 The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; santa-clause-2-the ) Santa Clause 2 The (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Santa Clause 2 is a worthy successor to the original 1994 film a that is to say anyone under age 10 will be enchanted; anyone over age 10 will have trouble stifling their boredom. The movie has a laudable quality or two but overestimating the audiences intelligence is not one of them. Even the so-called ""clever"" moments of satire (such as the opening segment in which Santas workshop must avoid detection from a nearby plane) are too juvenile to be considered suitable for adults. The movie begins with Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) the newest Santa Claus preparing for his annual rounds. This year he has two problems a his teenage son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) is on the ""naughty"" list and his head elf Bernard (David Krumholtz) has informed him that in order to keep the waistline and the beard he has to find a Mrs. Claus. Thats right its the ""Missus Clause."" (Ho Ho Ho) And he only has four weeks. Once Christmas Eve arrives if he isnt hitched neither will the sleigh be and greedy materialistic children everywhere will be left weeping and gnashing their teeth. So leaving the North Pole in the care of a facsimile of himself Santa Scott heads south and sparks fly the moment he meets Charlies attractive-but-repressed principal Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell). Wonder with whom Santa is going to choose to spend all those cold lonely North Pole nights? As a sappy family-oriented romantic comedy The Santa Clause 2 isnt too bad but figuring that kids might not be too interested in Santa smooching the filmmakers felt the need to introduce two frighteningly bad subplots. The first involves the plastic-and-rubber Santa stand-in who turns out to have dictatorial tendencies. The second is a painfully trite bit of character building that wallows in Scotts angst at being an absentee father. Charlie is misbehaving at school; it must be Scotts fault because hes away ""on business"" all the time. Tim Allen who has largely been out of the spotlight since the conclusion of his TV series ""Home Improvement"" plays Scott as an infinitely more likable guy than in the first film. Elizabeth Mitchell has no problem with the simplistic role of the Scrooge who learns to listen to the ghosts of Christmas past. Eric Lloyd as the result of 8 years of natural aging looks nothing like he did in the original The Santa Clause. Also back for return engagements are Wendy Crewson as Scotts ex and Judge Reinhold as her new husband. The director is Michael Lembeck a TV veteran who is making his feature debut. He clearly wasnt given much of a budget to work with. The special effects are bad enough to be embarrassing. When compared to the imaginative majesty of Whoville in Ron Howards How the Grinch Stole Christmas Santas North Pole looks nothing short of cheesy. Whatever money Disney invested in this project must have gone to pay Allen and the small army of writers employed to develop the so-called screenplay. The Santa Clause 2 is entirely inoffensive so it makes for perfect family fare a but only if the children are young enough to be indiscriminating about what theyre seeing. Most parents are used to making sacrifices for their children. Electing to accompany them to a showing of The Santa Clause 2 is just another of the joys of being a mother or father.
