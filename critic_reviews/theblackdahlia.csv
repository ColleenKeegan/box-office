But it had a solid precedent in LA Confidential (also from an Ellroy novel) and its key motifs - doppelgangers monomania grotesque violence - seem a good fit for director Brian De Palma. Unfortunately another of De Palmas pet fascinations runs away with the show like many of the characters hes unhealthily enamored of the flickers.In January 1947 the mutilated body of Hollywood wannabe Betty Short was found severed at the waist in an empty LA lot. Around this real-life case is spun a fictional web involving boxing rivals turned LAPD partners Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) - each increasingly obsessed with the case each comforted by Lees girlfriend Kay (Scarlett Johansson) - and the powerful Linscott clan including femme fatale Madeleine (Hilary Swank) and pill-popping mater Ramona (an eye-rolling film-stealing Fiona Shaw).Ellroys prose crawls into characters secret hearts and under the readers skin but its foetid horrors become kitschy here the script too streamlined and the lead performances too shallow to dredge the storys depths. Its a story in part about the cruel tension between the glamour myth and its ugly construction but De Palma indulges the former the burning cars in the opening riot scene are that bit too well-placed and while there are impressive coups de cinema - the long crane shot that discovers the corpse an awkward social encounter shot in the first person another staircase shoot-out homage (this time to Vertigo) - its hard to see how they serve the story. Only the introduction of screen-test footage of Short (Mia Kirshner) in conversation with a boorish off-screen producer played by De Palma himself exposes the needy self-delusion the film otherwise coddles.

"Black Dahlia The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; black-dahlia-the ) Black Dahlia The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli If all that mattered in movie-making was that the end result was pretty to look at I would be giving Brian De Palmas The Black Dahlia a rave review. Theres no denying the films visual virtues the cinematography the set design the costumes the hairstyles and the makeup. The screenplay however is another matter. For about 90 minutes it moves at a brisk pace flowing along a familiar noir stream that survives a few minor rapids but as the end approaches it goes into a freefall over a waterfall and lands with a crash. The resolution is so convoluted that it requires not just one but two expository scenes and even after those were still not sure how everything fits together. While its true that many noir thrillers emphasize style over substance few are as fundamentally unsatisfying and confusing as The Black Dahlia. The Black Dahlia is based on the fictional novel by James Ellroy not the real-life unsolved mystery. Ellroy used that cold case as a launching pad for his novel and the movie does the same thing. In actuality the murder of Elizabeth Short (the actual ""Black Dahlia"" case) is only a subplot in the film. This is the story of two fictional detectives assigned to the crime. Its the need to tie everything into a neat package at the end that exposes the most egregious flaws. L.A.P.D. detectives Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are the departments stars because of their unparalleled record in bringing fugitives to justice. At the time of the infamous ""Black Dahlia"" murder where the dismembered body of aspiring actress Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner) is discovered in an open field Bucky and Lee are working another case tracking a child rapist. However Lee becomes obsessed with the Short killing and aggressively pursues a seven-day transfer for himself and Bucky to the taskforce. Bucky agrees only reluctantly however believing its more important to get their original quarry off the streets. Investigating Shorts past leads Bucky to femme fatale Madeline Linscott (Hilary Swank) with whom he begins a relationship. Meanwhile sparks are flying between Bucky and Lees girlfriend Kay (Scarlett Johansson) but neither acts on them out of respect for Lee. The acting in The Black Dahlia is not a strong point. Everyone from Scarlett Johansson to Hilary Swank to Josh Hartnett looks great in late 1940s garb but the performances are uneven. There are times when Hartnett and Johansson appear stiff and Swank goes over-the-top on at least one occasion. She is outdone in the overacting category only by Fiona Shaw (playing her mother) who delivers enough ham to feed a multitude. The most consistent performer is Aaron Eckhart. Mia Kirshner is also effective but because of the nature of her role she appears only in film clips of Shorts Hollywood auditions (the first time we ""meet"" the character shes a corpse). Brian De Palma has spent the better part of his career working in the noir arena (he was once considered a Hitchcock imitator) so it isnt surprising that he was attracted to the project. Indeed the noir trappings are executed effectively although the movie isnt as atmospheric as one might anticipate. There are some nice individual sequences including a thrilling foot chase that involves stairs and a vertiginous fall (shades of Hitchcock). However it is surprising that De Palma didnt demand that the plot be streamlined to the point where two talky anticlimactic scenes are not required to complete the story. The sloppiness of the ending doesnt only damage The Black Dahlia it sinks the project. Movie-goers have a right to expect more from a denouement than what De Palma delivers. This is far from one of the directors better efforts and should be avoided by all those who are not sworn De Palma boosters.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Inconsequential Confused Plot Erratic Acting Wilt Black Dahlia Thriller Hartnett Is Strong Johansson Lost In Translation to 40s Hottie; Fine Lennon on His Activism By Joe Morgenstern Updated Sept. 15 2006 1201 a.m. ET Brian De Palmas ""The Black Dahlia"" based on the James Ellroy novel stars Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart as cops investigating a fictional version of the gruesome murder that mesmerized California in the 1940s -- a case that in reality remains unsolved. During their investigation the L.A.P.D. partners Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard grow obsessed for different reasons with the victim Elizabeth Short. Its easy to see why. In a film within the film a tawdry black-and-white screen test that becomes a piece of evidence Betty Short (Mia Kirshner) is the heroine of her own wrenching drama -- a pretty poignantly earnest girl whose dreams of stardom came to nothing but death. If only the film outside that little film were as strong or as clearly focused. The production certainly looks sumptuous and certifies Mr. Hartnett as a mainstream movie star. But the script is frequently impenetrable the pacing is ponderous and the film noir style cant conceal a crucial piece of misconceived casting. At first the story seems to carry echoes of ""Jules and Jim."" (In a movie by Mr. De Palma whose work includes ""Dressed to Kill"" ""Carrie"" and ""Scarface"" lots of things echo other movies.) Both of the partners who are also rivals as avocational boxers cherish the company of Blanchards girlfriend a radiant blonde named Kay. ""Always shed be there"" Bleichert recalls in a voice-over narration ""never between us always in the middle."" ENLARGE In a movie of the period Kay might have been played by Lauren Bacall Rita Hayworth or the co-star of ""The Blue Dahlia"" Veronica Lake. (The name the newspapers gave the case was a play on the title of that film.) In ""The Black Dahlia"" shes played by Scarlett Johansson a young actress with a great gift for contemporary roles -- her performance in ""Lost In Translation"" was close to perfection -- but a terribly shaky sense of how real people or real movie stars comported themselves six decades ago. Whenever shes on screen the fabric of theatrical illusion threatens to unravel and its a fabric woven by two masters of the motion picture arts -- the production designer Dante Ferretti and the cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond. Movie lovers will appreciate the classic Technicolor palate of a New Years Eve party (though thats hardly in the tradition of film noir) or the swooping soaring camera movements -- think ""Touch of Evil"" -- in the scene when Elizabeth Shorts body is discovered in the grass by the side of a road. When Josh Hartnett is on screen theres no danger of mistaking him for Humphrey Bogart or Alan Ladd; he too is a product of his time. But in a movie marred by broad acting strokes -- Aaron Eckharts Blanchard all but foams at the mouth -- Mr. Hartnett takes the camera to use an old-fashioned phrase with an authority that ranges from minimalist to just-enoughist and a voice through which Bucky Bleichert his flawed knight of honor speaks volumes in deftly modulated syllables. Two other performances light up the screen -- or more accurately in this noir emulation furnish it with burnished bedazzlement. Hilary Swanks Madeleine Linscott has lots of money a sleek roadster a whiskey voice a taste for depravity (think ""Chinatown"") an eerie resemblance to the dead Betty Short (think ""Vertigo"") and an ability to command our rapt attention. Fiona Shaw gets much less screen time as Ramona Linscott Madeleines batty boozy mother (think Gloria Swanson in puffed sleeves) but what she does with it is a chilling wonder. If pungent atmosphere could fill the gaps ""The Black Dahlia"" would be the movie that Brian De Palma may have wanted it to be. But crime stories -- even intricate stories like this one -- are expected to achieve more than a modicum of clarity. In ""L.A. Confidential"" a brilliant period piece adapted by Brian Helgeland from another James Ellroy novel the intricacy was formidable yet the clarity was -- eventually -- complete. In ""The Black Dahlia"" which was adapted by Josh Friedman narrative strands tangle and wither minor characters clutter the plot Blanchards behavior becomes a frustrating bafflement and the baroque denouement leaves us begging for less. Like Bleichert wandering through a surreal barely fathomable landscape were interested in watching things go by. Still it would be nice to know whats going on. The U.S. vs. John Lennon Almost an hour goes by before ""The U.S. vs. John Lennon"" focuses on the Nixon administrations efforts to do something about the Beatle who during the Vietnam War exhorted young people to ""give peace a chance."" (After putting him under close FBI surveillance the government tried and failed to deport him.) Until then this loosely organized but still fascinating documentary by David Leaf and John Scheinfeld uses clips and mostly liberal or left-wing talking heads -- vs. only the stone-faced G. Gordon Liddy -- to chronicle Lennons growth as an artist and his emergence with Yoko Ono as an activist who by his own admission was selling peace like soap and also selling it like hotcakes. ENLARGE John Lennon and Yoko Ono at a 1972 protest in New York City The production had Yoko Onos blessing so Lennons foibles are played down in favor of his fierce determination to speak out and sing out against the war. (One might infer from that first hour that the Beatles provided accompaniment for the peace movement as a whole.) But his determination was unflagging even when his naivete led him into a hapless alliance with hard-left radicals pushing their own revolutionary agenda. The films most dramatic moment deals with the nature of protest in popular culture. Rather than a clash between Lennon and the government its a confrontation previously seen in the 1988 documentary ""Imagine John Lennon"" between Lennon and the late Gloria Emerson of the New York Times. Emerson is shrill and haughty to the point of patrician self-parody; todays audiences wont know that she did fearless distinguished reporting from Vietnam. Perhaps because she had seen wars horrors up close she finds the upbeat quality of ""Give peace a chance"" impossibly simplistic and tells Lennon hes making himself ridiculous. He is unrepentant about having written such a happy-go-lucky anthem and with good reason. In the most downbeat of times upbeat sells.    DVD TIP The full force of Brian De Palmas technique is on display in ""The Untouchables"" (1987) a gorgeously theatrical evocation of gangland Chicago in the 1930s heyday of Al Capone. David Mamet wrote the script which sets Capone (Robert De Niro) against the untouchable -- i.e. uncorruptable -- quartet of Special Agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner); a young sharpshooter (Andy Garcia); a veteran cop (Sean Connery) and a middle-age accountant (Charles Martin Smith). The cinematographer was Stephen H. Burum and the music was by Ennio Morricone.

By Jeff Shannon      Special to The Seattle Times Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Black Dahlia"" with Josh Hartnett Aaron Eckhart Scarlett Johansson Hilary Swank and Mia Kirshner. Directed by Brian De Palma from a screenplay by Josh Friedman based on the novel by James Ellroy. 121 minutes. Rated R for strong violence some grisly images sexual content and language. Several theaters. Its natural to have high expectations for ""The Black Dahlia"" which radiates prestige and boasts the kind of dazzling set pieces that are director Brian De Palmas specialty. James Ellroys source novel is considered one of his finest and 1997s Oscar-winning ""L.A. Confidential"" was also adapted from one of Ellroys crime-fiction classics. Failing to meet those expectations doesnt make De Palmas film bad but it lacks the visceral punch of ""L.A. Confidential"" posing as a lurid approximation of vintage film noir that ultimately falls prey to De Palmas operatic overtures. Known as The Black Dahlia for her taste in black fashion 22-year-old aspiring actress Elizabeth Short found fame only in death as the victim in Los Angeles most notorious unsolved murder case. Her bisected body was found on Jan. 15 1947 its organs removed blood drained mouth slit from ear to ear in a hideous grin. Her killer was never found and Ellroys novel builds its speculative plot around two L.A. cops whose lives unravel in the course of their investigation. Former boxers Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett simmering nicely) were known as ""Fire amp; Ice"" as rivals in the ring. Now theyre newly partnered detectives sharing a platonic passion for Kay Lake (Scarlett Johannson) the former girlfriend of a killer Lee sent to jail. Jacked on Benzedrine and obsessed with Shorts murder Lee goes into a psychological tailspin (relegating Eckharts fine performance to the sidelines) while Bucky enters the treacherous orbit of Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank) a bisexual socialite with a freak-show family including a mother driven batty by intimate knowledge of L.A. corruption. (Played deliberately over-the-top by Fiona Shaw shes a case of over-indulged comic relief.) As adapted by Josh Friedman (who wrote Spielbergs ""War of the Worlds"") ""The Black Dahlia"" boasts a few clever inventions. By showing ""Betty"" Short in screen-test flashbacks (played with sad vulnerability by Mia Kirshner with De Palma voicing her off-screen director) she becomes the movies tragic heart and soul immortalized for all the wrong reasons. De Palma strengthens her presence by maintaining discreet distance from her murder. Less effective as a mystery clue though visually intriguing is the decision to translate Ellroys literary reference to Victor Hugos ""The Man Who Laughs"" into a cinematic one although why characters like Kay Bucky and Lee would attend a screening of Paul Lenis 1928 silent version of ""The Man Who Laughs"" is anyones guess. Its a convenient connection thats awkwardly employed like Buckys visit to a lesbian nightclub where a tuxedoed k.d. lang croons like a transplanted anachronism. Even more awkward are the crucial performances of Johansson and Swank actresses of proven skill who seem reduced here to hollow play-acting dolled up in Oscar-worthy costumes and lit by the great cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond for maximum vamp appeal. Despite these and other weaknesses ""The Black Dahlia"" remains curiously fascinating. When you consider that much of the film was shot in Bulgaria its evocation of late-40s Los Angeles is consistently impressive with a Mark Isham score that sets the proper mood.

Starring Josh Hartnett Aaron Eckhart Hilary Swank and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Brian De Palma. (R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The world of ""The Black Dahlia"" is beyond bleak beyond film noir. Based on the novel by James Ellroy it takes place during the postwar era which gave birth to noir but shows crimes more gruesome and corruption more endemic than the noirs ever depicted. Director Brian De Palma invests careful attention in creating this world building lush tableaux that impart an aura of glamour and doom. But with the exception of Aaron Eckhart De Palmas actors cant live up to the period or the atmosphere. Josh Hartnett Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank -- talented people whove done good work in the past -- ultimately come off like lightweights like kids playing dress up. This impression takes a while to settle in. It doesnt happen immediately and it certainly doesnt happen as soon as we see them. On the contrary all three look great. Yet in each case a sense of baseline believability gradually erodes through performances that are neither lived in nor filled in. And all at once the mask is off and ""The Black Dahlia"" begins to look like a bunch of children just found their way into their grandparents clothes closet. Were they too young? At the time of filming Hartnett was 27 Johansson 21 and Swank 31 but then Robert Mitchum was 29 and Kirk Douglas was 30 during the making of ""Out of the Past"" and Jane Greer was 22. Lauren Bacall was 21 when she made ""The Big Sleep."" In fact the actors are about the right age for the characters theyre playing. Maybe 27 means something different in 2006 than it did 60 years ago. Maybe the experience of a world war puts miles on people giving them a weariness a perspective and an understanding of their place in the grand scheme. In any case what is certain is the result When Swank slinks around like a femme fatale its funny. When Hartnett stares off pensively as if the world is on his shoulders there is nothing on his shoulders. And when he picks up Johansson and throws her down on the dinner table both of them too overcome by lust to go upstairs to the bedroom all we can think of is the waste of a perfectly nice meal. They look clumsy and silly and theyre making a mess. Later when you stop laughing take time to marvel at what they cant accomplish and what Mitchum and Greer could with just a close-mouthed kiss on the beach. It would be tempting to blame De Palma for this and say that the films hyperstylized atmosphere infected the performances in some negative way except that Eckhart strikes exactly the right note. As the hotshot cop Blanchard a former boxer turned police detective hes driven obsessive effusive and unknowable. He leaves no doubt that the poison he encounters in his police work is in his bloodstream and that maybe it was there from the beginning. Hartnett as Dwight another boxer turned cop is paired with Blanchard and they become inseparable buddies with Dwight the third wheel on dates and dinners with Blanchard and his girlfriend (Johansson). Gradually it becomes silently understood by the characters and subtly communicated to the audience that Blanchard may be the flashier cop but that Dwight is the better man. Already working on another case the two are soon pulled into the Black Dahlia investigation. It blows everything else off the headlines A young woman a would-be actress who worked in lesbian porno films is found dismembered and disemboweled. The case brings a lot of eccentrics out of the woodwork including Swank as Madeleine an heiress who likes to dress like the Dahlia and slink around lesbian bars even though she seems to like men. Swanks not much of a slinker but she tries. Mia Kirshner who plays the Dahlia is seen only in audition and stag footage but she makes a real impression of the Dahlia as a sad lonely dreamer a pathetic figure. Josh Friedmans screenplay could have been streamlined more around the Dahlia story. Dwight and Blanchard pursue one case too many and a minor plot element involving a murderer who preys on children and the elderly could have been cut in the interest of clarity. Then again if all the actors were as good as Eckhart the movie would not feel long. De Palmas visual intelligence is palpable. In depicting the murder victims body he shows very little -- a few seconds of the victims face a close-up of the victims hands -- and the effect is horrifying rather than disgusting. In one scene he films down a Los Angeles side street and we see a man and woman talking to each other on the steps. Its just a snapshot of people of life in a dangerous seductive place suggesting stories well never know. The only place De Palma fumbles -- or could this be intentional? -- is in the scene in which a mystery man commits a murder. We dont see the face but the identity of the killer is unmistakable even from behind Just look at the ears. -- Advisory This film contains gruesome images blood violence nudity and simulated sex acts.

Two cops (Aaron Eckhart right and Josh Hartnett) are called to investigate the homicide of an ambitious actress in The Black Dahlia. Photo Universal Pictures The Black Dahlia 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Ive long defended Brian De Palma even after it became fashionable to flog him. True his films often have been overheated overdirected and overly imitative -- mostly of Hitchcock -- but at least hes been willing to swing for the fences. In The Black Dahlia De Palma swings for a grand slam but falls short. He turns James Ellroys what-if novel about a wannabe starlets 1947 slaying into an epic of old-L.A. corruption that pretends to make Chinatown look like a drop in the bucket. It doesnt. Yet Im still drawn to this sort of thing having worn out my copy of Kenneth Angers Hollywood Babylon with its shocking tales of ""Heroin Heroines"" and ""Dangerous Curves."" Who knows what evil lurks in the heart of Hollywood? We all do. The decay under the tinsel gives the company town its twisted anything-goes allure. But though Dahlias true-life basis is ripe for picking De Palma is too fixated by Ellroys fictionalized book. He hurriedly skips past names and events that a reader would have ample time to absorb making coherence a casualty in his dizzying vortex of villainy. Vainly navigating a labyrynth isnt my idea of entertainment so I settled for savoring the films deeply noirish tableau and wildly wicked characters. Dahlia seethes with atmosphere and Hollywoods underbelly is always worth an ogle. As in Ellroys L.A. Confidential cops are our companions. Josh Hartnett plays Bucky a principled detective whos partnered with Lee (Aaron Eckhart) an opportunist. The two are tight and that bond extends to Lees wife Kay (Scarlett Johansson) as if theyre a family. Lees hands are dirty -- we just dont know how much. But the grime beneath his nails starts to show when he seems too personally involved in the slaying of Elizabeth Short a nobody who became a somebody by suffering Hollywoods grisliest murder. Ill spare you the details here; De Palma does not. Leery of Lee while tracking Shorts killer Bucky hits places both seedy and ritzy often at the same time. Take the palatial home of a crooked tycoon (John Kavanagh) and his clan including Hilary Swank as his thrill-seeking daughter. Their dinner table scene of appalling manners is so weirdly funny it belongs in another movie. But largely this Dahlia is black indeed with butchery insanity and heinous evil. Even good-guy Bucky succumbs performing sex acts with violent over-the-top passion that reeks of overcompensation by an aging director. (Or perhaps De Palmas just aping 70s peer David Cronenbergs A History of Violence.) The only restraint comes from composer Mark Isham whose soft lush music seems better suited to a glossy Douglas Sirk melodrama. Narrating offscreen with proper world-weariness Hartnett carries the picture well enough. Pursuing doggedly and suffering soulfully he is its much-needed conscience. And the denoument is satisfying even if the road there is bumpy. Yet its all just theory and hooey not a real true-crime expose. Beyond an exercise in supposition what use is this? Its like another idle interpretation of the Zapruder film. Shorts murder remains unsolved though many once rushed to take credit for it. And since everyone loves a mystery its been a favorite of writers and filmmakers with 1981s True Confessions another case. Heck it even has fans. Forget seeing stars homes. Los Angeles now has a ""Black Dahlia Crime Bus Tour."" I suspect its got a different vibe than the Sound of Music bus tour I once took in Austria but for fans of a certain type its probably one of their favorite things. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off Banana Republic Final Cut Sale Up to 75% off + free shipping...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post It takes precisely the right kind of actor to pull off a neo-noir. When re-creating the cynicism paranoia and sexy fatalism of classic film noir a modern director has to choose his leading men carefully. The hard-bitten hero - or anti-hero - needs to look older than his years wearied by pessimism. He must snarl artful hard-boiled lines about thrown fights and double-crossing dames without sounding as if hes in a high school production of ""The Maltese Falcon."" And when he finally gets the girl he should look like he doesnt care about getting the girl right up until the moment he cares very much. Noir cops shouldnt go doe-eyed for Scarlett Johansson in the first scene no matter how swell she looks in a cashmere sweater set. All of this to warn that Brian De Palmas ""The Black Dahlia"" never rises past the poseur stage to become noir of its own for the perfectly forgivable fact that Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart are not Bogie and Mitchum. Or even Brody and Affleck given that last weeks neo-noir ""Hollywoodland"" is a much better movie. De Palma is trying to re-create the Russell Crowe-Guy Pearce-Kim Basinger magic of 1997s ""L.A. Confidential"" using another James Ellroy crime novel. Rival cops chase morality and fame in the semi-corrupt Los Angeles police force of the late 1940s. Their efforts are encouraged and hindered by a blond femme fatale whose own path toward morality took a detour on Sunset Boulevard. With such a fine example as Curtis Hansons ""L.A. Confidential"" as their mark (nine Oscar nominations two wins) its hard to tell when Hartnett and Eckhart are playing Ellroys characters and when they are reduced to lesser imitations of Crowe and Pearce. Johansson is far more lost a virtual teenager in a plot made for grown-ups. She will not make anyone forget the smoking-hot sad-as-rain Basinger and her Academy Award anytime soon. Hartnett is neither intense nor cynical enough to sort out a twisted plot that intentionally recalls noir classics from ""Chinatown"" to ""The Blue Dahlia."" For many of his crucial scenes Hartnett appears on the verge of tears. Bogie may have sported an ulcer-ready grimace for much of his career but he never looked like he was crying when he played private-eye. Eckharts smiling deviousness might have worked in his role as an increasingly compromised golden-boy detective. But the movie sidetracks him into an obsession with gruesome murder photos of the Dahlia and then makes him disappear during crucial stretches. About that plot? Pour some hot joe black as night and get ready to sling some hash. A beautiful wannabe actress turns up butchered - literally. She was the Black Dahlia turned into an icon by the tabloids the police department and L.A.s glam-lesbian nightclub scene. Hilary Swank playing the pouty dangerous rich girl Madeleine Linscott starts dressing as the Dahlia for kicks. While Eckharts cop becomes obsessed with the Dahlia Hartnett grows enamored of Swanks look-alike; of course the two plots shall meet. Hartnett also has a pistol in his holster for Johansson completing the love triangle from ""L.A. Confidential."" A half-dozen other murders and complications are nearly incomprehensible in Josh Friedmans script. The climactic scene plays like a farce just after De Palma has reverted to gory form by showing us more of the taxidermy business than a layman needs to know. Its laughable - and not the kind of bitter laughter that can make noir bite so deep. De Palma composes some nifty shots including a Hartnett- point-of-view cam during his meeting with the bizarro Linscott family. The zoot suits and fedoras look great but without a script or hard-eyed private detective in sight its merely a production designers exercise. Since the leading men are so important to successful noir who could do it well? Id love to see Philip Seymour Hoffman as a cynical gumshoe. Kevin Costner has the right demeanor of quiet cynicism. Denzel Washington tried it on in ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" and it worked. Daniel Day Lewis? Joaquin Phoenix? Terrence Howard? Bring them on. A good neo-noir is just a casting call away.

Comments The Black Dahlia Director Brian De Palma will probably take the rap for this tepid noir but the real culprits are Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson red-hot lovers in life but (as ever) gorgeous stiffs on-screen. Adapted from the novel by James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential) the movie uses the notorious unsolved 1947 murder of a drifting young woman as the historical backdrop for a love triangle involving a hotheaded police detective (Aaron Eckhart) his sex-kitten girlfriend (Johansson) and his circumspect partner on the job (Hartnett). Hilary Swank is sorely miscast as a decadent rich girl but Mia Kirshner gives a haunting performance as murder victim Elizabeth Short whose black-and-white screen tests (quite fictional) deliver the emotional darkness so lacking in the rest of the movie. Fans of the directors cinematic homages will be pleased by a Touch of Evil crane shot that masterfully foreshadows a subsequent plot twist. R 121 min. By J.R.

"Miscasting does in De Palmas The Black Dahlia - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Miscasting does in De Palmas The Black Dahlia By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 15 2006 Since `` The Black Dahlia"" more or less tells the story of an actress a heinously murdered one at that it makes sense that the first thing you notice about this so-so adaptation of James Ellroys novel is the shoddy acting.Fixating on the performances seems inevitable since its a Brian De Palma picture. The director bears the unique distinction of being responsible for some of the most sublime performances in the movies (Sissy Spacek in ``Carrie"" say or John Travolta in ``Blow Out"") and some of the worst (see ``Bonfire of the Vanities"" -- or dont). But ``The Black Dahlia"" is woefully short on the sublime.Ellroys 1987 novel spun the notorious butchering of Elizabeth Short a 22-year-old aspiring starlet from Medford into a strange noir melodrama. Like the book the film is set in post-World War II Los Angeles and tells the tale through the lazy eyes of Dwight ``Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) a lanky cop and ex-GI who is promoted from beat work to the sexier warrants division.There along with his psychologically volatile partner Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) Dwight descends as too many real-life men have into an obsession with the case of the dismembered young woman. Mia Kirshner plays Betty dolorously in flashbacks and screen tests that provide the film with its only true emotional substance. You can see why writers and detectives would have a hard time shaking those big sad eyes.Hartnett seems ideal for this line of work. He has a slow-to-wake innocence that suits a character whose detective skills always appear to be two or three scenes behind ours. The characters smarts are slightly below average and Hartnett doesnt have the gravity to raise him up. Hes almost too innocent.One of the films many outre developments involves Dwights relationship with Lee and his girlfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson). They welcome him into their lives forming a sort of triangle that grows less equilateral every time Kay leans in to talk to Dwight during Lees inexplicable absences.The cops search for Bettys murderer leads him to her uncomfortable stint in girl-on-girl porn and to a fabulously seedy lesbian bar where k.d. lang is singing Cole Porter and Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank) a kinky acquaintance of the deceased has just made a furtive exit.Madeleine is odd. Her wealthy family is nuts. Dwight comes to pick Madeleine up for a date and winds up sitting down for a meal with her Scottish father (John Kavanagh) deranged mother (Fiona Shaw) and cute crass little sister (Rachel Miner). Its dinner theater in every possible way. Yet the movie is never quite as good or weird as that sequence. In fact what comes next is ultimately a drag. De Palma does a passable job of restaging highlights from his earlier better movies. One climactic murder sequence in ``Black Dahlia"" set on an indoor balustrade conjures the carriage-descending-a-staircase moment from ``The Untouchables"" and crosses it with the slasher stuff from ``Raising Cain."" Theres also a lovely daylight sequence of cars and characters pulling shadily in and out of a wide frame done mostly in a single take. And the editing with its wipes and melting fades is playful. But my does ``The Black Dahlia"" feel empty.Ellroys book was composed rather creepily in a fit of filial obsession. His mother was killed some years after Betty Short and by the authors admission her murder fueled his writing about Shorts. So in a sense the novel was the product of personal compulsion and psychological purging. De Palma would seem ideal for material of such dark provenance. His best and most inspired work -- ``Sisters"" ``Dressed to Kill"" ``Blow Out"" ``Body Double"" -- is about the inexhaustible narrative possibilities of obsession. But ``Black Dahlia"" is too structurally and thematically sloppy to either capture obsession or inspire it.This adaptation by Josh Friedman doesnt try to make any sense of Los Angeles social history the way Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson did with their strategic paring down of Ellroys ``L.A. Confidential."" De Palmas movie is content being vague and trashy which is fine. But not everybody in the cast seems prepared for such lurid business and you pity De Palma. He seems unaware that hes not working with the dynamic stars of his prime. This movie has no Travolta or for Petes sake Kevin Costner to bestow respectively a palpable sense of sex or strain of morality.MORE HOLLYWOOD CRIME To view a photo gallery of classic thrillers set in Hollywood visit www.boston.com/films. For instance he doesnt seem to know how to use Johansson. (Few male directors do.) Shes playing a homemaker with a sad past and barely seems to be registering the present. She Hartnett and Eckhart who barrels through the part with his chin make merry in one early dinner sequence thats embarrassingly corny. Swank though gives off a slummy classical-Hollywood hauteur thats fun insofar as it feels like shes playing dress-up.``The Black Dahlia"" calls to mind 1976s all-teen gangster spoof ``Bugsy Malone"" minus the vitality and sporty musical airs. The sight in De Palmas movie of these kids -- theres no other word -- pretending to be grown-ups suggests a crisis in Tinsel Town ``The Black Dahlia"" feels too much like a put-on to be completely seductive. Its less a smutty murder mystery than a film-noir costume party.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

(90 min.)Less a documentary than a love fest for Al Franken this scattershot movie shot over two years follows the zigzag trail of political satirist Al Franken as he feuds with Bill OReilly campaigns against George W.

The choice of Brian De Palma to direct ""The Black Dahlia"" which would seem like perfect casting turns out to be all too imperfect. Based on the James Ellroy novel about the notoriously unsolved L.A. murder of aspiring actress Betty Short it mainlines De Palmas career-long obsession with sex and violence. But perhaps hes been down this road too many times. Too often in ""The Black Dahlia"" - which stars Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett as two cops and Scarlett Johansson as the woman who comes between them - we seem to staring at noirish waxworks. There are some virtuoso moments (the discovery of the mutilated corpse is extremely well done and blessedly ungraphic) but overall the result is much less than prime De Palma. Grade B - P.R.

"The Black Dahlia reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Black Dahlia reviewed. The Black Dahlia reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 14 2006 533 PM Murder Most Foul Brian De Palmas dreadful Black Dahlia. By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens Spoiler Special about  The Black Dahlia  by clicking the arrow on the player below Aaron Eckhart and Scarlett Johansson in The Black Dahlia Theres more moral weight in one paragraph of James Ellroys somber 1987 novel The Black Dahlia than in all 121 minutes of Brian De Palmas florid sprawling self-satisfied film version. Where Ellroy exposed with an often brutal candor the misogynist rage behind his protagonists (and his own) obsession with the beautiful bisected murder victim of the title De Palma exploits that same misogyny without a trace of introspection. When the movie does exhibit a flash of spirit its because some of Ellroys dialogue has survived the glitzifying machine. When it sags--and theres a long enough sag about three-quarters of the way through that you could go refinance your home and still make it back for the closing credits--its because story-wise De Palma has taken matters into his own hands. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. But theres a reason De Palma remains in the rank of important filmmakers after a nearly 15-year run of bad movies (the first Mission Impossible in 1996 was one notable exception). Even when engineering a howler like this he does it in such high style with such a confident swagger that the movie is half over before you realize how little is there. And De Palma has a way of surrounding himself with the best The production design by Dante Ferretti and cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond give The Black Dahlia (Universal) a feeling of texture and solidity that belies its inherent flimsiness. Advertisement In the screenplay co-authored by Ellroy and Josh Friedman the novels countless overlapping threads have been condensed to a still-confusing three or four plotlines. Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are cops and former boxers who become partners after a bout in the ring orchestrated by the LAPD. Bucky falls hard for Lees live-in girlfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson) but the crush remains chaste and the three become fast friends. On the trail of a child molester Bucky and Lee are sidetracked by the sensational murder of an aspiring actress named Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner) whos been found chopped in two in a vacant lot. (The famously gruesome tabloid photos of the real-life victim are reproduced with a creepy exactitude.) As Lee spirals further down into an obsession with the woman the press dubs the Black Dahlia Bucky embarks on a dangerous flirtation with Kay and an even scarier affair with a bisexual heiress named Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank). One important plot point hangs on Madeleines ostensibly eerie resemblance to the dead girl but Swanks strong hawklike features have nothing to do with Kirshners gamine face. The movie asks us once too often to take things like this for granted and loses our trust along the way. Eckharts Lee descends so quickly into a slavering preoccupation with the Dahlia murder (complete with that universal murder-mystery cliche the hidden shrine to the victim) that we stop even paying attention to the nuances of Eckharts hard-charging performance. But it almost doesnt make sense to analyze the performances in The Black Dahlia since every actor seems cast in a movie of his or her own invention. Josh Hartnett is his usual blank boyish self more a Hardy boy than a hardened cop. Hilary Swank gives a Jennifer Jason Leigh-style performance full of hysterical bravado. Her voice is a note-perfect mock-up of Faye Dunaways in Chinatown and her bearing is that of the classic noir vamp but all that technique nearly smothers the overmatched Hartnett (in addition to killing the audiences libido). Scarlett Johanssons problem is the exact reverse. She doesnt really bother to act at all but her rounded confectionery beauty is perfectly suited to Jenny Beavans luscious 1940s costumes; in angora shes like a sex toy manufactured by Gund. De Palmas last film Femme Fatale was frank fun trash; The Black Dahliaspretensions to be something more are what trip it up and make it at times embarrassing to watch. And if The Black Dahliasambitions are to be anything but pure camp someone forgot to copy Fiona Shaw on that e-mail. She plays Madeleines permanently drunk mother Ramona as a late Bette Davis by way of Margaret Dumont. Shes uproariously funny in her one big scene but was she intended to be? ""How sick are you?"" Kay asks Bucky at one point in the film questioning his and his partners growing involvement with the dead Dahlia. Unfortunately for the audience De Palma has no interest in answering her question either for Bucky or for himself. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Stories De Palma wilts and Affleck is eh. Plus scruffy crusader Al Franken. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis (Photo Rolf Konow/Courtesy of Universal Pictures) A critic often has to play the role of coroner dissecting a work to find out why it died (or never lived) but Im frankly stumped by the Brian De Palma thriller The Black Dahlia; I cant tell you how it ended up such a stiff. It has a potent source James Ellroys feverishly overplotted fantasia on Hollywoods most notorious unsolved murder the 1947 killing of Elizabeth Shorta pretty not too bright young woman who arrived in L.A. with dreams of stardom got around (and around) and wound up a different sort of legend. Photos of her bisected corpse are horrible in ways that transcend the grisly particulars. Drained of blood and denuded of innards her body had been turned into a sculpture of violation with a smile slashed from ear to ear that made her look as if she were enjoying the spectacle of her own dismemberment. The sadism was mythic. Ellroys spin on the Dahlia case is intensely personal; you fully understand it only when you read his nonfiction book My Dark Places a memoir of his obsessive investigation of the unsolved murder of his motheran alcoholic with a secret life who died when he was 10. In The Black Dahlia the killing of Elizabeth Short warps everything in the world of Ellroys alter ego a prizefighter turned cop named Bucky Bleichert (played in the film by Josh Hartnett). Obviously arrested at some prepubescent stage (like uh 10?) Bleichert is happiest as a third wheel in the company of his partner and sometime boxing opponent a hothead named Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and Blanchards girl Kay (Scarlett Johansson). The Black Dahlia is one of those light-angel/dark-angel tugs-of-war The caring part of Bleichert gravitates toward the damaged Kay but the nasty part makes a beeline for Madeleine (Hilary Swank) a rich girl whos a ringer for the Dahlia and who prowls the night for lovers in Dahlia regalia. In this magazines Fall Preview issue I wrote that in prospect The Black Dahlia is a disturbingly perfect marriage of filmmaker and subjectand thank God for that in prospect. I guess I was primed for something that De Palma already gave us in Obsession Dressed to Kill and Body Double a Vertigo-esque melodrama full of sinuous tracking shots and multiple planes of reality a blood wedding of Hitchcock and the voluptuous Italian splattermaster Dario Argento. But either the director didnt want to revisit that phase of his career (his last film Femme Fatale came close to burlesquing it) or he couldnt hack a clear path through Josh Friedmans overly faithful screenplay. Im not sure anyone could Friedman cant get from plot point A to B without leaving the audience behind; Ive read the novel twice and even with the movies wont-shut-up narrator I didnt know what was going on. The Black Dahlia is an essay in incoherence. The confusion wouldnt matter if there were any feeling onscreen but the blood and innards seem missing from the movie too. Its a stilted thingoverstylized and inexpressive like high-school kids playing dress-up or bad Kabuki. The great Vilmos Zsigmonds sepia palette makes you wish you could adjust the tint knob and what registers most powerfully in the low-angle shot of cops staring down at the Dahlias corpse are their snazzy hats. Out of perverse chivalry the director who has spent his career batting off (largely unfair) charges of eroticizing violence against women points his camera at one of historys most hideously fascinating crime scenes from a football field away. Nothing here tracks. Madeleine is supposed to be the Dahlias double but Swank doesnt at all resemble the waifish Elizabeth Short of Mia Kirshner (seen in flashbacks). And since this is another hopeless attempt by Swank to embody sultry femininity everything she touches turns to camp. Hartnett isnt in the same picture anyway; hes like a kid waking up in the middle of a movie with no idea whats going on. Johansson was bred for long white gowns and cigarette holders but her putative Madame Tussauds counterpart could have given this performance. In context the solidly second-rate Aaron Eckhart looms large. And dwarfing all is Fiona Shaw as Swanks dipsomaniacal mothera loopy gargoyle. There is one sequence for the De Palma highlight reel a circular staircase killing with just the right mixture of spatial-temporal dislocation and a touch of freakish geometrythe elongated silhouette of a stiletto-wielding assassin. That its not of a piece with anything else is irrelevant; its the only part of The Black Dahlia with a pulse. Unlike certain national political figures Ben Affleck has always had the decency to look embarrassed at being unqualified for his job but its sad that he doesnt even have the histrionic resources to be convincing as a washed-up fifties B-movie actor. Hollywoodland is the other true-Hollywood-mystery movie in theaters an exploration of the suicide (or was it murder?) of fifties TV Superman George Reeves. Reeves had an easy but peppy presence that was very likable and Afflecks moroseness doesnt do him justice. The back-and-forth cutting between past and present would be clunky even if it werent so arbitrary and it doesnt help that Adrien Brodyas the films other protagonist a burnt-out gumshoeis more actorish than the supposed actor. So is Diane Lane as Reevess married lover but she does know how to bounce off the handsome blob without being enveloped by it. 1 2 Next Share this story...

The pic finds Brian De Palma in fine visual fettle as he pulls off at least three eye-popping set pieces while trying to keep plotlines under control. Given the difficulty even ""L.A. Confidential"" had in attracting a sizable audience anything more than a moderate B.O. turnout looks doubtful. A literally ripping good yarn is undercut by some lackluster performances and late-inning overripe melodrama in ""The Black Dahlia."" Based on James Ellroys estimable fictional account of what was for 47 years Los Angeles most notorious unsolved murder this lushly rendered noir finds director Brian De Palma in fine visual fettle as he pulls off at least three characteristically eye-popping set pieces while trying with mixed success to keep some pretty cockeyed plotlines under control. Given the difficulty even the significantly superior Ellroy adaptation ""L.A. Confidential"" had in attracting a sizable audience anything more than a moderate B.O. turnout looks doubtful. Like the novel script by Josh Friedman (""War of the Worlds"") uses the horrific 1947 killing of 22-year-old would-be actress Elizabeth ""Betty"" Short as a way to delve into the specifically Southern California brand of crime sleaze corruption hypocrisy cover-up disillusionment and dream-crushing that has been a staple of resonant pulp fiction for decades. In this respect ""The Black Dahlia"" covers familiar ground both thematically and in its seductively tawdry atmosphere highlighted by the usual downtown-area locations deco apartments constant cigarette smoke beautiful cars men in natty suits and hats and women in gorgeous glamour gowns with the gap between the rich and powerful and those they would keep down never far from the center of things. Add the evocatively bluesy-jazz score and you might almost hear yourself muttering ""Chinatown."" But ""Chinatown"" it aint not in any department. On its own level however new pic generates a reasonable degree of intrigue initially in the ambiguous relationship among tough L.A. homicide detectives Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) younger partner Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) -- former boxers nicknamed ""Fire"" and ""Ice""- and their voluptuous blond platonic ladyfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson). What gives with this threesome isnt revealed until later but Eckhart in particular takes the opportunity of the opening half-hour set-up to carve a strong impression as a volatile aggressive cop ready for just about anything on a police force that craves his kind of guy. In the first big set piece the camera arches high and low and around and about in covering Lee and Buckys stakeout of and shootout with some lowlifes in a lousy neighborhood. As their real target slips away the mutilated body of a young woman is discovered in a field across the street; shes been cut in half disemboweled and drained of blood her head bludgeoned and her mouth extended by three-inch cuts on each side into a sick grin details the police are intent on withholding from the public. Hotshots Fire and Ice take on the case but their few interviews with those who knew Betty Short yield little other than her grandiose dreams of movie stardom and her good-times attitude toward men especially those in uniform. Bucky becomes fixated on a long screen test he discovers in which Betty (Mia Kirshner) was prodded and interrogated by a director (voiced by De Palma himself). Strangely the combination of Bettys killing and the imminent release of a criminal he long ago put away makes the more experienced Lee flip out; with this the most watchable and compelling character in the picture thus far frequently disappears from view for murky reasons forcing the lower-voltage Bucky and Kay to the fore. This changes for the better when Buckys investigation into a lesbian angle in Bettys life leads him to high-society dark lady Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank) who turns up during a wonderful for-gals-only supper club production number of ""Love for Sale"" crooned by none other than k.d. lang. The suggestive sparring between the working-class cop and the classy woman with a pronounced physical resemblance to the murder victim may not be of the highest order but its enough to get them where they need to go between the sheets and into a hot romance involving untold layers of deception. Madeleine proves the lowly Buckys passport to the rarefied realm of the citys drippingly wealthy starting with her family Theres naughty younger sister Martha (Rachel Miner) batty mother (Fiona Shaw) and strange Scottish father (John Kavanagh). A dinner scene with this quintet is so bizarre you can only laugh with Shaws perf so over the top albeit intentionally that it amounts to a curious spectacle unto itself. The convergence in a marbled lobby with massive surrounding stairs of Bucky the unhinged Lee and his now ex-con adversary provides the elements for De Palmas most virtuoso scene one in which shocking and upsetting violence forever alters the trajectories of several lives and the picture. Hereafter revelations about who was up to what become essential leading to a big and near-ludicrous explanatory scene in which far too much information needs to be swallowed in one gulp to be remotely digestible. Once the table has been cleared its hard to buy whats proposed here as a satisfactory resolution to an persistently baffling case. Eckharts very good and so is Swank as a temptress with many games to play. But Hartnett is too blank and expressionless to carry the picture; he narrates and is almost constantly on view but offers little nuance or depth. His Bucky is the eternal hard-bitten cop who learns lifes bitter lessons on the job. Its not the actors fault that so many great macho stars have made their names playing such parts but its impossible to watch ""The Black Dahlia"" and not idly think of how indelibly Bogart Mitchum Sterling Hayden Jack Nicholson Russell Crowe and numerous others have handled such roles. Although she looks properly in period Johansson also is weak evoking little of the requisite vulnerability in a damaged woman who keeps the reasons for her hurt and her real emotional impulses deeply submerged. Seen mostly in the vintage black-and-white screen test and brief flashbacks Kirshner nicely catches the unformed dreaminess of a young fabulist who became famous only in death while supporting cast of lesser-known thesps playing cops and baddies registers well. Its great to see cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond working at full command on a big picture again after several years on more marginal projects. His scope framing and constant camera moves possess a bracing confidence. Much of the film was shot in Bulgaria but youd never know it as Dante Ferrettis unerring production design and Jenny Beavans costumes combine with sufficient Los Angeles exterior work to provide authentic atmosphere. Mark Ishams moody old-fashioned score is one of his best pumping up the dread and suspense and often providing emotional substance where the actors cant manage it.
