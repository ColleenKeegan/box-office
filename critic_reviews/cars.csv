But take it out for a spin for 2 hours and it runs out of gas. 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Cars Animation. Featuring the voices of Owen Wilson Paul Newman and Bonnie Hunt. Directed by John Lasseter. Co-directed by Joe Ranft. (G. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Cars are people in the new Pixar animation ""Cars."" They talk. They have feelings ambitions senses affections and passions. There are old ones and young ones pretty ones and homely ones humble ones and wealthy ones. In the stands during an auto race the spectators are also cars. The movie depicts a world without humans one in which automobiles have interiors but for no discernible reason except maybe as some evolutionary holdover. No one rides inside. For a 10-minute short this car world would be a cute conceit. But ""Cars"" is a 116-minute movie of epic length by animation standards and an odd thing happens after watching all these talking cars for so long. Curiously and unexpectedly the movie brings on a suffocating feeling of constraint. Its a consequence of seeing characters with such terribly limited mobility Sure they can go fast or go slow but they have no arms or legs. They cant touch anybody. (In fact when two cars touch its usually a disastrous thing.) You know the Richard Dreyfuss movie in which hes completely paralyzed and all he can do is stay in bed and talk? Think of that and now imagine wheels under the bed. Thats about the experience of ""Cars."" Yes its a creative idea and yes Pixar realizes this car world to the full extent. But not all ideas are good even if realized. The faces of the cars for one thing are far less expressive than the animated human faces we see in the brief short (""One Man Band"") that precedes the feature. In the short the animation captures subtleties of reaction and emotion but the car faces dont lend themselves to nuance. It was also probably inevitable that the car-people parallel beaten into the ground gradually stops being rewarding and starts to feel misplaced. Here we have for example a young hotshot hot rod Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) who wants to win a great race. Great. In a 10-minute short there would be nothing to think about. But in a 116-minute movie questions seep into the mind Why does he want to win? To have groupies? To eat in nice restaurants? To go on great vacations? The poor thing is an armless legless cumbersome creature inhabiting a lonely landscape in which no real connection is possible. Antonioni should have made this movie. Or Tod Browning. But wait I can hear some of you saying. Arent we taking this a bit too seriously? Its an animation Its a kids movie And thats true it is. But the way to take a movie is on its own terms and the terms of ""Cars"" are that of a drama. Young Lightning on his way out to the West Coast for the big race accidentally ends up stuck in a small town near the mountains. There he meets the humble small-town folk falls in love with a girl (Bonnie Hunt) and gets life lessons from an old race car. Paul Newman plays the old race car and hes not Robin Williams. He gives a completely straight performance without a shred of humor. Its exactly what the script demands. In a way ""Cars"" can be regarded as an experiment to find out if a dramatic Pixar animation (albeit with a few comic interludes) can work artistically. That remains to be seen but I think the relative failure of this movie can be measured in the answer to this question Who would you rather look at in a scene about a young mans education Owen Wilson and Paul Newman or a computer drawing of a red and blue car? ""Cars"" might get us into car world as a gimmick but it doesnt get us into car world as a state of mind. Thus the animation rather than seeming like an expression of the movies deeper truth becomes an impediment to it. That said for all its length its pleasing to the eye and despite unnecessary story loops the movie redeems itself near the finish. However condense all its delights and ""Cars"" is still no equal to ""One Man Band."" That four-minute short gives ""Cars"" a tough act to follow.

Directed by John Lasseter from a screenplay by Lasseter Dan Fogelman Joe Ranft Kiel Murray Phil Lorin and Jorgen Klubien. 117 minutes. Rated G. Several theaters. A tangle of race cars swirls around a vast track moving so fast theyre just a flash of color and dust. We watch the race and then were shown the stands -- they too are full of cars thousands of them each a dot of quivering color like an enormous rack of Mamp;Ms. This is the world of ""Cars"" the newest feature from Pixar Animation Studios and its a delight. In the clattering ever-changing world of movie franchises its nice to know that the Pixar mark of quality remains constant. The gang of wizards behind ""Finding Nemo"" ""The Incredibles"" ""Toy Story"" and the rest understands how to craft stories that appeal to all ages and how to bring them to life with perfectly rendered animation. While ""Cars"" falls just a bit short of the companys most sublime efforts -- its laid-back storytelling befitting its nostalgic theme perhaps is a tad too leisurely in a few places -- the film is a sweet funny tale of friendship and loyalty which I enjoyed even more on a second viewing. The 7-year-old with me loved it. Down our row a much smaller child leaned toward the screen with a rapt expression as if wanting to enter its world. At its heart the tale of ""Cars"" is familiar A central character discovers that hes lonely and in the course of a journey learns about the importance of friendship. Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is a snappy rookie race car determined to make it big. On his way to California for a big race some wrong turns land him in Radiator Springs a quiet town off Route 66 that got left behind when the interstate came through. There he meets a motley assortment of locals among them Doc (Paul Newman) an elegant 1951 Hudson Hornet with a secret; Sally (Bonnie Hunt) a pretty and pert-voiced Porsche; Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) a dimwitted tow truck with a gift for friendship; Fillmore (George Carlin) a flower-decaled VW bus with a taste for organic fuel; and Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) a tire-store owner obsessed with Ferraris. After soaking up the quiet appealing pace of their lives Lightning becomes part of it; as in so many Disney films he finds a family. Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter small-town life may well be lost on this movies young audience (there were signs of restlessness in the theater during the ballad ""Our Town"" sung by James Taylor) ""Cars"" finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove. Each car looks unique (though all have eyes on their windshield rather than the expected headlights) with precise character details Docs silver grille looks like a dapper mustache; Mater when he sleeps drools oil. All the colors look slightly faded in the Southwestern sun and some of the scenes (such as a gorgeous drive through a tree-lined canyon) have the idyllic beauty of a vacation postcard. And the film is full of trademark Pixar touches of humor (my favorite a hilarious cameo from National Public Radios ""Car Talk"" guys). Tiny flies buzz around the street lights in Radiator Springs; look closely and youll see that they have little wheels too. ""I fell in love"" confides Sally to Lightning explaining why she relocated to the small town. ""Oh"" he purrs ultra-knowingly. ""A Corvette?"" ""Cars"" gives us a richly detailed imaginative world which turns out charmingly to look a lot like our own.

"Cars reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Cars reviewed. Cars reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 9 2006 457 PM Sunday Drive The pleasure of Pixars Cars. By Michael Agger The stars of Cars The new Pixar movie is called Cars (Disney). Its hard to think of a title that would more instantly light up the hearts of men and boys except perhaps Nachos. The movies hero is Lightning McQueen a race car (voiced by Owen Wilson) who is poised to become the first rookie to win the Piston Cup. Hes also cocky and vain and doesnt have any real friends. A highway mishap leaves Lightning stranded in a one-horse Western town where the local carfolk led by a crusty doctor (Paul Newman) teach him valuable lessons about trust and sharing. Lacking a 7-year-old in my life I often hesitate to go to Pixar movies since they contain such direct blasts of emotion. More than anything else they celebrate friendship or rather the time when friendship mattered most. Cars does this splendidly; it will make a zillion dollars. The opening montage was something of a shock a race around an oval track with pounding rock music and revving engines. I worried that the director John Lasseter had overdosed on NASCAR and some kids near me started freaking out. Soon the movie settled down and everyone began to laugh. This was when Larry the Cable Guy showed up. He gives voice to Mater a rusty tow truck with buck teeth and a warped mind. Before you shout ""stereotype"" realize that the image of the South in this movie is positive. The Southern-inflected world of car racing is presented as one ruled by chivalry and honor where people decry cheating and respect the achievements of their elders. (The venerable star of the racing circuit is a stoic gentlemanly car known as The King voiced by Richard Petty.) Plus what sense of humor would deny Larry the Cable Guy? His drawl is a lovely instrument overflowing with character. He delivers the movies sweetest line ""I knew I made the right decision ... choosing you as my best friend."" Advertisement The heartfelt sentiments of youth are just one part of the Pixar formula The other is a virtuoso visual intelligence. Liberated from physical restraints and grounded in meticulous storyboarding the scenes of Cars are never static. And while the movie may have one joke its a very good one Imagine every type of humanity represented by some sort of car. A 1960 VW bus is a genial hippie who sells organic oil. The fans in the infield during the races are giant RVs with elaborate roof attachments for drinking beer. Lightnings love interest is Sally Carrera a Porsche 911 who left the fast life in California and ""just kept driving"" until she wound up in the backwater of Radiator Springs. Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) is also the conscience of the movie. Accompanied by a James Taylor song she tells us how the town was once a bustling place with its beautiful location on ""the mother road"" Route 66. But then the interstate came the traffic stopped their friends moved away and the town died all because people wanted to save a few minutes of travel time. A nice story but just try driving a classic like Route 1 for a few miles and see how quickly you hightail it back to I-95. Lasseter and his team would naturally have affection for the local and unique. Its a mirror of the way Pixar works with each animator perfecting his own small patch of brilliance. The scene where Mater and Lightning go tractor-tipping (the automotive analog for cow-tipping) is one of the most heartwarming on-screen bondings since Elliott and E.T. went for a bike ride. There is also a lively ""date"" of sorts when Lightning and Sally go on a motorly frolic through the Southwestern landscape. And whoever was in charge of the neon lighting should get a promotion. Like its predecessors Cars builds some terrific momentum piling on the visual gags arch references and throwaway jokes. I dont know if a 7-year-old would laugh at the detail-perfect depiction of a Japanese newscaster as cute mini-car but I thought it was great. Indeed the two-hour running time will send more than a few kids to the pits. Whos this movie for again? No matter Its impossible to find more joy in the dark at the moment.

Talking trains adorable. Talking horses wiseasses. But talking cars? Cars a revved-up family contraption about a cocky red race car and the rustbucket town of misfits who teach him lessons in life is as bumptious spangly and cheerful a thing as Pixar has released in 20 years of computer animation. It certainly earns overdue respect for garrulous sports coupes everywhere. That its not as incredible as The Incredibles or as genre-tweaked as A Bugs Life or as hilarious and true as the ToyStory films points not so much to the movies deficits as its place amid some of the keenest character-driven films of the past half-century. (Arrive on time for a clever new short. And stick through the credits for a tribute.) So the plot is formulaic the characters are stock -- and were not talking NASCAR. Were talking Doc Hollywood on a Hot Wheels track City slicker in the fast lane gets sidelined in a bumpkin town only to find true happiness and (maybe) hubba-hubba love. The one new twist in the tale is its setting in a universe populated by cars and trucks much as Foxs Robots offered a world of cyborgs. Its a slick concept inventively animated with VW ""bugs"" buzzing around a fluorescent light and mooing tractors tipped by nighttime pranksters. The town is sleepy Radiator Springs a ghost burg off Route 66 where zippy Lightning McQueen (dude-egotist Owen Wilson) finds himself accidentally on his way to the Big Race. In the midst of his convoluted arrival Lightning destroys the villages main thoroughfare for which crime he must stay in Radiator Springs to repair it. He meets the locals Doc the cranky Hudson (gargly and wise Paul Newman an old racer himself) Sally the sexy Porsche (Bonnie Hunt) Luigi the 59 Fiat (Tony Shalhoub) and so on. The cast is crammed with huge names in tiny parts -- listen for cameos from Mario Andretti and Dale Earnhardt Jr. -- but the real scene-stealer is a dilapidated tow truck named Mater (""like tuh-mater cept without the tuh"") voiced with note-perfect backwater affability by Larry the Cable Guy. Though bookend race scenes vibrate with the whoop and buzz of high-test-tosterone Cars (directed by Pixar veteran John Lasseter) plays more like a trip down memory lane misty for the olden days of motor travel. Nostalgia tints everything from the films majestic desert vistas to its perky vehicular anthropomorphism windshields blink cars hop with joy Lightning sticks out his tongue. And the filmmakers clearly had a party animating their dream rides; if you squint youll find saliva where they drooled. But after watching this and An Inconvenient Truth Al Gores documentary on global warming in the same week I confess to feeling a touch woozy. Are cars cute or are they the Antichrist? In The Omen the Antichrist is cute so maybe cars can be good and evil simultaneously like Famke Janssen in X-Men The Last Stand. (What did she drive? I mean aside from her husband crazy.) Youll have to excuse me; like an old alternator Ive lost my bearings. Fortunately the same cant be said of Cars. It thunders ahead with breezy abandon scoring big grins on its way. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Sperry Mens Baitfish Leather Flip Flops for 35 + free shipping Bass Pro Shops Beat the Heat Sale Deals from 2 + free...

Whod have imagined a mere two months after he ran out of gas in his first live-action movie wed be humming the praises of Larry the Cable Guy? His Mater is the Walter Brennan of computer-generated fare. He doesnt stutter but rust and all hes one of those down-home naifs that tickles. For more than a decade Pixar has been ingeniously giving life to feature-length characters like Mater who inhabit surprising worlds. Pixar movies cant easily be converted into live-action fare. Theyre that inventive. ""Cars"" is a little pedestrian by Pixar standards. Its as if ""Doc Hollywood"" had been rendered in binary code for the car-seat crowd A cocky protagonist winds up doing time in a pokey burg where he learns a thing or two about love values community and his place in it. Its not that the company has run out of gas. Far from it. But clocking in at nearly two hours ""Cars"" idles at times. And its not until its final laps that the movie gains the emotional traction weve come to expect from the ""Toy Story"" and ""Nemo"" crews. Thank goodness then for Mater short for Tow Mater. He lives in Radiator Springs the town where NASCAR rookie Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) gets his moral tune-up. Other carbureted citizens include lowrider Ramone (Cheech Marin) and wife Flo (Jenifer Lewis); Luigi (Tony Shalhoub); and his wee partner in the tire biz Guido. Theres Doc Hudson who hides his glorious past well. Car-racing Paul Newman gives voice to the muscular Hudson Hornet a Detroit dinosaur that helped launch NASCAR in the 1950s. Sally Carrera a sky-blue Porsche (Bonnie Hunt) exited Los Angeles fast lane and became the narcoleptic towns No.1 booster. Bypassed when Interstate 40 made Route 66 the road less traveled Radiator Springs has fewer visitors than a dusty museum exhibit. The same cant be said of the Southern race track jammed with spectators for the the Piston Cup Championship. There Lightnings bravado puts him in a comfortable lead. His arrogance hands him a photo finish and a three-way tie with ""The King"" (Richard Petty) and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) to be settled in a rematch in California. In ""Cars"" speed is cool. Its also a culprit. And a plume of nostalgia wafts over this toon. You can find an aching for the open road of Roger Miller Monte Hellman as well as ""Thelma and Louise."" (Though our fuel-guzzlers and our wide-open spaces are both endangered.) Theres also joy in the guttural revving of engines that makes NASCAR loud and proud. Directed by Pixar whiz and guiding honcho John Lasseter (""Toy Story"") ""Cars"" wrestles with the American need for speed as well as our yearning for a more thoughtfully paced era. If you dont get this theres a James Taylor-sung ballad ""Our Town"" written by Randy Newman. If this sounds like heady fare for a kids flick it is and isnt. All the best animation units ply storycrafts version of vertical integration where parental ruminations are tucked into the center of colorful candy. (When the King tells Lightning hes ""got more talent in one lug nut"" than all the other competitors you know who the pun is meant for.) G-rated ""Cars"" shifts into eat-my-dust gear when Mater takes Lightning on an adventure in a nearby field where they engage in a classic rural prank. Like an earlier gag in which a posse of nitro-burning hotties straight out of ""The Fast and the Furious"" toy with Lightnings Mack truck this is pure Pixar pleasure.

"Classic Cars finds the soul in the machines - USATODAY.com SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Movies Cars  Event tickets   Jobs Real estate  Shop   Online degrees ABOUT THE MOVIECarsVoices Owen Wilson Paul Newman Bonnie Hunt Larry the Cable GuyDirectors John Lasseter and Joe RanftDistributor Walt Disney Rating GRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesOpens today nationwide Classic Cars finds the soul in the machines Posted 6/8/2006 901 PM ET E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Cars lionizes the lure of the open road and the appeal of a simpler time in a way that is both technically impressive and touching. The wizards at Pixar (Toy Story The Incredibles) never seem to take a wrong turn and Cars is yet another example. Director John Lasseter and company have a unique way of not only bringing inanimate objects to life but also making us love them. These gas-fueled metallic characters dont merely have personalities--they have emotional depth. We forget these are rusty old Hudsons or flashy Porsches. Their mechanized aspects are secondary. Whether its a talking cowboy with a pull cord or a 1959 Chevy Impala we see ourselves in these objects. The animation is stunningly rendered. But the story is always the critical element in Pixar movies and Cars story is heartfelt with a clear and unabashed moral. Its not quite as winning as either Toy Story movie both of which are still the gold standard in the Pixar catalogue but its definitely as entertaining as Finding Nemo. Owen Wilson voices Lightning McQueen (an homage to car-loving actor Steve McQueen). Lightning is a cocky race car rookie. Through a series of unexpected events while en route to the Piston Cup championship he takes a detour off the fast track and ends up in Radiator Springs a town the world seems to have forgotten just off Route 66. The town is filled with endearing eccentrics the curmudgeonly Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) who has a secret past the sassy Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) and a rusty tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy). Theres a VW van that runs on organic fuel (George Carlin) and tangles with an ultra-patriotic jeep (Paul Dooley). The plot offers an uplifting message about the importance of family and community over fame. Though it features a captivating car race winning the trophy is not the ultimate goal. It reflects on the value of hard work and friendship laced with plenty of humor. When Lightning goes AWOL speculation abounds as to his whereabouts. ""Lightning McQueen must be found"" thunders a Hummer doing a dead-on Schwarzenegger. Cars is stoked by the imagination of two key people Lasseter and co-director (and multifaceted voice talent) Joe Ranft who died last August. They are a pair who know how to turn a simple story into something iconic. Cars is a classic American tale firing on all cylinders and fueled by organic emotion and a lively sense of adventure.

"Cars | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cars ) Cars (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Thus far Pixar has given features and voices to bugs toys monsters and fish so why not cars? Although Cars is arguably the weakest animated feature to emerge from the virtual drawing board at this successful company its also the best animated film to come along since Disney distributed The Incredibles. The flaws in Cars relate to how younger viewers will see the film - its a little too long and a little too slow. While adults may not mind sitting through ""filler"" children with their notoriously short attention spans may become restless. Cars brings two well-worn clichA(c)s to the animated realm. The first is the uneasy buddy relationship between an older gent and a young hotshot. The second is the story of how a pastoral setting seeps into the blood of a city boy. Cars is character-driven which means that it has fewer action scenes than most recent animated films. Aside from car races theres very little here to base a video game upon. The action/adventure limitations allow the character arcs to breathe and provide room for a love story but there are times when the pace is sluggish. Cars transpires in a world of automobiles where there are no humans or animals. Even the flies are tiny cars with wings. Owen Wilson provides the voice of Lightning McQueen a rookie NASCAR-inspired race car striving to win The Piston Cup. When he ends the season tied with his two chief competitors Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) and The King (Richard Petty) its off to a winner-takes-all tie-breaker in California. Along the way however Lightning wanders off the interstate and gets stranded along Route 66 in the tiny Carburetor County town of Radiator Springs. Arrested for traffic violations Lightning is sentenced to repair the road before being allowed to continue west. At first he resents this but soon friendships form with tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) who takes him ""tractor tipping;"" with Sally (Bonnie Hunt) the motel owner who takes him on long scenic drives; and with Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) a retired race car champion who teaches the youngster a few lessons while surprisingly learning a thing or two. Will Lightning finish the road in time to make it to the big race? Will he abandon his true love and Radiator Springs for the spotlight of fame and fortune? Admittedly you probably know the answers but its still fun watching them play out. The story may be soft for a Pixar film but the animation in Cars exceeds anything we have previously seen and thats quite a statement considering how far computer-generated visuals have come in the last ten years. Pixar sets the bar higher; now it will be up to Fox and Dreamworks to see if they can match or top this level. (Considering how much recent animation has been about product at the expense of art one wonders if theyll try.) The single most stunning sequences come during Lightning and Sallys ""Sunday drive"" as they head out into the desert canyons and up into the mountains. The landscapes are as gorgeous as anything ever before depicted on film animated or otherwise. Other of Cars parts are impressive; this one is breathtaking. As usual the voices are expertly chosen. Owen Wilson has the requisite mix of brashness and likeability to play Lightning the self-absorbed car who discovers theres more to life than winning races. Paul Newmans Doc Hudson sounds wise and world-weary. Bonnie Hunt abandoning her usual sardonic style is bright and chipper. Larry the Cable Guy is perfect as the friendless dim bulb Mater. Cheech Marin Tony Shalhoub and George Carlin also contribute. The only questionable choices are the cameos - both Jay Leno and Bob Costas appear miscast the former as a late-night talk show host and the latter as a sportscaster. Meanwhile racing fans will appreciate contributions from Richard Petty Darrell Waltrip Mario Andretti and Michael Schumacher. The humor as is typical of Pixar is comprised of jokes aimed at all age ranges. Some of the comedy will go over the heads of younger viewers but there are plenty of gags for the junior members of the audience. Overall if the film is not as funny as its predecessors thats probably part and parcel of why it doesnt seem as enchanting. Emotionally despite the character arc Cars doesnt resonate in the same way The Incredibles or Toy Story did. The film represents solid family entertainment and this will be reflected in a huge box office windfall but while Cars may cross the finish line ahead of any of 2006s other animated films its several laps behind its Pixar siblings.

"Young and Fuelish washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Young and Fuelish Grilles Grilles Grilles Some of the colorful characters from the animated ""Cars"" enjoy some off-road time. (Copyright Disney/Pixar) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 9 2006 The new animated fable ""Cars"" is the story of a young fellow with what might be called auto-erratic tendencies. He pays too much attention to himself and must have his frame straightened his oil changed his wipers refurbished. Okay so? Hes a car. The movie is set in a world so auto-normative that even the mountain ranges look like tail fins the mesas have the lines of 40s fenders and the hummocks are hood ornaments. Human beings? Never heard of em. Its the latest concoction from the geniuses at Pixar probably the most inventive of the computer-generated imagery shops (""Toy Story"" I and II and ""A Bugs Life"" were theirs) and the films great fun if well under the level of the first ""Toy Story."" The story actually has resonances to the kind of old boxing tales they used to tell in the 30s. A champ whos really a chump gets an important lesson in humility compassion and respect when waylaid in a small town; he comes back the better for his ordeal and this time the chump becomes a champ. Our hero one Lightning McQueen is some kind of sleek red sportster on a NASCAR-like circuit (why he has the body of a Ferrari but a Texas accent is never explained nor does anyone bother to point out that all the other guys on the track are big square Detroit grinders). There may be an echo of upstart Jeff Gordon in the story situation; Gordon came from nowhere in NASCAR dominated with his talent but off-put with his arrogance for a number of years. At any rate Lightning (the voice behind the bumper is Owen Wilsons) thinks quite highly of himself particularly when he ties for the Piston Cup the movies version of the Nextel Cup. A runoff between Lightning and his two opponents is set in California a week hence even if Lightnings crew has abandoned him because of his selfish hog-the-spotlight ways. Off he sets in the belly of his one remaining friend a big Peterbilt rig geared for auto transport. Possibly the best few minutes of the film are director John Lasseters evocation of the American landscape or rather carscape as the big red truck wends its way across the United States of Carmerica. The Pixar people have an extreme talent for conjuring imagery that is soaring in its majesty but also resonant -- its a stylization but acute enough to carry emotional meaning. And boy can these guys do a sky If youve got a sentimental weakness for the hues that play across the cloud tufts as the big orb sinks behind the mountains this is the movie for you. But brash impetuous Lightning pushes his buddy too hard and in a weird accident is spilled off the road. He comes to rest in a town passed by the superhighway called ""Radiator Springs."" Pursued by a cop (in what Id guess is a 48 Buick) he manages to tear up the main drag is arrested is sentenced to community service and spends a week towing an asphalter -- a great belching smoking chunk of 30s industrio-mechanical ingenuity -- down the fractured drag a mighty comedown for something that streamlined red and cute. But while hes there he interacts with townspeople falls in love learns a little something and gets beaten in a car race by a salad dressing manufacturer. Actually his nemesis isnt Paul Newman but Newmans tonsils bringing melancholy wisdom edged with regret to the role. Newman plays Doc Hudson the towns elder a fellow with a mysterious past who has forgotten more about most things than other people even know. Hes the one with the life lessons for Lightning and the most interesting personal history. (If you know your racing history the name Hudson Hornet may ring a bell as it recalls long-past golden days when the low-slung high-powered speedster gave the big boys of Detroit all they could handle.) Newmans is far and away the best vocal performance; itll have Newman fans recalling his older wiser Fast Eddie Felsen from ""The Color of Money"" Martin Scorseses sequel to ""The Hustler."" Wilson is really too wispy to be there and Bonnie Hunt as a romantically inclined Porsche Carrera barely registers. Larry the Cable Guy is strong as a down-home tow truck. I think its the voices and the lack of human figures and movement that leave ""Cars"" less empathetic an experience than ""Toy Story"" with its star turns by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. On the other hand Radiator Springs as a movie illusion is itself a fascinating confabulation. The Pixar folks have a gift for giving their car-characters emotional appeal by virtue of extremely expressive eyes set in the windshield. At the same time the things remain automotive Their skin glistens in the light differently by sun than by neon their tires bite the earth they sway on their shocks they fishtail or scoot like the real thing. All of this takes place in a charmingly evoked town that once embraced the care and feeding of Automobilicus americanus but then lost out when the interstate took the traffic around rather than through. The town is mythically sited on the Mother Road that famous band of coast-to-coast concrete ribbon that inspired the great Nat King Cole. In fact ""Cars"" proves you can still get some kicks on Route 66. Cars (116 minutes at area theaters) is rated G.

The making of any movie can be laborious of course but heres a statistic that will send shivers down your spine In the new Pixar comedy ""Cars"" the average time to render a single frame of film was 17 hours. Kind of makes you feel like a slacker no?Now that Ive divulged my reluctance allow me to also divulge that ""Cars"" although obviously the product of highly gifted and hard-working animators is something of a misfire.Why should this be after an unbroken string of critical and commercial successes for Pixar that includes the ""Toy Story"" movies ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Incredibles""? Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? For one thing there is simply too much story none of it terribly interesting or fresh. The only novelty here is that ""Cars"" is populated entirely by cars - bright shiny racers rusty tow trucks sporty Porsches and imposing antiques like a 1951 Hudson Hornet. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is a red race-car rookie who is primed to win the upcoming Piston Cup Championship in California. On the way his life takes an unexpected detour in the backwater town of Radiator Springs off Route 66. There he befriends goofy Mater the tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy) and the sky-blue Porsche Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt). Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) that vintage Hornet is the towns Man With a Past - a crotchety Yoda.As one might expect director John Lasseter and his codirector the late Joe Ranft have done a fine job of bringing to life these driving machines. But as chock-full of personality as they are their incessant chatter is wearying and they lack the anthropomorphic complexities of the fish and bugs and toys and superheroes of the earlier Pixar films. They remain steadfastly one-dimensional.The filmmakers resolutely realistic approach may be partly to blame for this. As Jay Ward the movies characters-department manager was quoted as saying ""John didnt want the cars to seem claylike or mushy.... They shouldnt appear light or overly bouncy to the point where the audience might see them as rubber toys.""But by relying too much on snappy dialogue and by adhering to the philosophy that ""steel should feel like steel and glass should feel like glass"" the filmmakers have bridled their imaginations and created a movie about toys that are too blubbery and not rubbery enough.

Visually each of their movies from ""Toy Story"" to ""Finding Nemo"" has redefined state-of-the-art CGI and ""Cars"" is as eye-popping as anything Pixar has done. But ""Cars"" inspires more admiration than elation. It dazzles even as it disappoints. This time around John Lasseter and his co director the late Joe Ranft seem more interested in dispensing Life Lessons than showing us a roaring good time.Lasseters biggest risk is making a movie in which no human or animal forms intrude. All the main characters are cars and frankly it takes a while to see the souls hidden under the metallic hoods. Our antihero is the rookie racing-car sensation Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) a go-it-alone look-out-for-number-one showboat with an agent in Hollywood (who else but Jeremy Piven) and dreams of big-bucks corporate sponsorship. En route to Los Angeles for a winner-take-all showdown Lightning gets waylaid in the dusty town of Radiator Springs where the local judge a crusty old Hudson Hornet (Paul Newman) sentences him to repave a ruined road. Stuck in the town that time forgot--though the screenwriters have clearly not forgotten ""Doc Hollywood""-- the selfish racing car must put on the brakes smell the roses and discover that there is more to life than winning.In spite of the narrative deja vu there are delightful compensations the rusty tow truck Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) who becomes Lightnings most loyal friend; the perky Porsche Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) a former fast-lane L.A. lawyer whos resettled in Radiator Springs and captures Lightnings hitherto unlocatable heart and George Carlins conspiracy-minded 60s relic (a flower-painted VW bus of course) who sells organic fuel. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week ""Cars"" is nothing if not heartfelt. In this nostalgic paean to small towns the villain is the high-tech interstate that put a wedge between us and nature. The irony is that this elegy for the antique comes from the computerized company that has relegated hand-drawn animation to the dustbin. If anyone knows that the old ways are not always the best its the folks who have boldly taken animation into the 21st century.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Despite another impressive technical achievement its the least visually interesting of the computer-animation boutiques movies and drifts slowly through its semi-arid midsection. Pic should still possess plenty of G-rated horsepower commercially. With ""Cars"" Pixars enviable streak of creative triumphs comes to a skidding stop. Despite representing another impressive technical achievement its the least visually interesting of the computer-animation boutiques movies and -- in an ironic twist for a story about auto racing -- drifts slowly through its semi-arid midsection. Periodic bursts of cleverness brighten the festivities but theyre too few and far between and the trademark humor that appeals to adults and kids often misfires. Pic should still possess plenty of G-rated horsepower commercially but falls short of being the coming-out party Disney doubtless hoped for to showcase its Pixar acquisition. John Lasseter Pixars leading creative force is a self-proclaimed car enthusiast and this marks his first directing effort since 1999s ""Toy Story 2"" -- preceded by ""A Bugs Life"" and the original Buzz-Woody team-up. (Joe Ranft his co-director died last year after completing work on the film.) Yet passion for the project notwithstanding Lasseter discovers there are only so many car puns he and five other credited writers can exhaust. And while adults might chuckle over pop-culture references to say funny-car ""Jay Limo"" both they and many kids will grow antsy after an introductory racing sequence. That race introduces Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) a brash racecar with a lone-wolf attitude. Lightning eschews hiring a crew chief and his competition against the surly Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) and veteran legend the King (racer Richard Petty) sets up a showdown in California a week hence. As a sign of his go-it-alone mentality Lightning balks at trying to drum up enough friends to fill the 20 tickets allotted him. Heading cross-country Lightning inadvertently winds up marooned in the moribund Route 66 town of Radiator Springs where his daredevil antics run afoul of the local judge Doc Hudson (Paul Newman). As punishment Lightning is forced to repave the towns decrepit road -- a task he pursues with reluctance given his goal of reaching California to win the Piston Cup. Bypassed by Interstate 40 Radiator Springs features the usual assortment of colorful characters in an all-car cast that includes an attractive Porsche Sally (Bonnie Hunt); the slightly addled tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy); and a half-baked van that runs on ""organic fuels"" appropriately voiced by George Carlin. The question is how long it will take for Lightning to revive the town while simultaneously learning the meaning of friendship. Alas ""too long"" is the answer and barring the boisterous antics of blue-collar comic Larry theres not much to make the time speed by. Granted there are amusing sight gags involving the local bugs (in keeping with the automotive theme Volkswagens with wings) and ""tractor tipping"" but like Lightning himself the action simply keeps running out of gas. Even Randy Newmans score isnt particularly distinguished or too frequently gets drowned out by the sound of roaring tires. Nor will the racing sequences galvanize those who arent NASCAR fans despite an astounding display of computer-generated wizardry and detail -- from the car-filled stadiums down to the little grooves on the track. Still nothing here approaches the undersea wonder of ""Finding Nemo"" the childlike inspiration behind ""Monsters Inc."" or the excitement and sly wit of ""The Incredibles"" -- a high standard admittedly but the expectation bar against which all Pixar ventures inevitably will be judged. Where ""Cars"" works best frankly might be in oiling the synergistic wheels of the Disney-Pixar marriage -- offering the enticing prospect of theme park tie-ins battery-powered toys and other assorted merchandising. Ultimately however those benefits are only maximized if the movie delivers and while the inventive closing-credit animation should send patrons out smiling that breezy detour arrives at the end of a dusty near-two-hour ride. Pixars run of hits has been nothing short of amazing rivaling Disneys early animated classics. Yet after assembling its version of the magnificent six the company has settled for at best a so-so seventh.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 3 Add review 0 Love It Save it Time Out says Details Users say (3) 4 out of 5 stars Time Out says Pixars computer-animated features rarely disappoint in terms of concept storyline characterisation or image rendering. Thats predominantly the case with this rollicking nod to the motor car and more pertinently the once lively US roadside towns that upped and died along with the advent of the bypass. Car-nut John Lasseter veered off through some of these ghost towns while travelling on Route 66 and was clearly inspired into getting the sentiment across on celluloid. Hes mostly succeeded. Mostly because while the film as a whole is great fun well written and superbly animated it takes far too long to get into gear. The first restless 20 minutes or so is spent in the vicinity of a loud racing oval where the films lead Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is seen trying to win the chance to enter the famed Piston Cup. Lightning gets his wish but en route to the circuit he accidentally rolls out of his trailer and finds himself in hick town Radiator Springs where he meets a quirky bunch of locals and the film finally finds its legs. Characterisation is as strong as ever but pole position goes to rusty tow-truck Mater the scene where he takes Lighting into the paddock to scare a herd of snoozing tractors is priceless. There are many other brilliant scenes some just as funn but there are just as many occasions where you feel the films struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still its a Pixar film right? And theyre always worth a gander no matter what anyone says.
