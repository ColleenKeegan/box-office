Even if hes in feeling in the pink physically he has to be spending a little time thinking about what comes next. If anything.Based on ""Hereafter"" which looks at just that question Eastwood seems to be saying its the here and now that really matters and we better all make the most of it. ""Hereafter"" is about death -- or more accurately living with an understanding of deaths inevitability. Of course this is not a topic that most mainstream American movies are willing to take on so its no wonder its being marketed as a sort of supernatural thriller. No when it comes to heaven most movies are more comfortable with either a comedic or benign concept of an afterlife. Friendly angels abound in films --  think of 1941s ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" which was remade in 1978 with Warren Beatty as ""Heaven Can Wait"" and again in 1991 with Chris Rock as ""Down to Earth."" These angels cheerfully show a newly dead person the ropes to eternal life or more often help them figure out a way to return to the living. As for heaven itself it used to be depicted mostly as a paradise where angels wear halos and pluckon harps amidst fluffy cotton candy clouds. For the most egregious example of the latter theres the racially offensive scene from 1934s ""Wonder Bar"" where Al Jolson in blackface cavorts about in a heaven where pork chops grow on trees and chorus girls also in blackface frolic holding giant slices of watermelon. By the late 20th century heaven had morphed into a sterile over-lit white space. And now thanks to special effects its become a brightly colored ever-changing screensaver. In 1998s ""What Dreams May Come"" Robin Williams died and found himself walking in neon flowering fields; and in last years ""The Lovely Bones"" the murdered adolescent girl was seen in an ever-evolving margharita-bright paradse. Even Steven Spielberg the ultimate sentimentalist couldnt resist heavenly visions. When he showed the Great Beyond in 1989s ""Always"" (itself a remake of 1943s ""A Guy Named Joe"") his glimpse of heaven offered a misty forest and Audrey Hepburn -- it was her final film -as the most chic angel ever dressed in a slouchy white cotton sweater and slim pants. Except heaven isnt what interests Eastwood in ""Hereafter"" nor is Hell -- which has had its own frequent depictions on film. What hes tackling here is how hard it is to wrap our heads around the finality of death. Based on a screenplay by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"" and ""Frost/Nixon"") ""Hereafter"" begins with a rush literally. Marie (Cecile de France whose fabulous haircut deserves billing of its own) a French television journalist is caught in a deadly tsunami while on vacation in the tropics. (The special effects are excellent.) She nearly dies -- she sees blinding white light and shadowy figures -- and finds herself still shaken by the experience long after she returns to Paris and tries to resume her job. The movies two other main characters are Marcus (Frankie McLaren) who lives in London and George (Matt Damon) whos in San Francisco. Marcus is a young boy whose twin brother dies leaving him bereft. George is an apparently authentic psychic in San Francisco who has given up his practice. ""Its not a gift its a burden"" he tells his brother. He could no longer deal with the extreme emotional pain of the desperate people who sought him out in hopes of reaching a dead loved one. Eastwood switches among these three establishing their characters with firm strokes and making us care what happens to them. And like any film Eastwood directs it is photographed and edited with smooth efficiency (shots last exactly as long as they need to no more) focuses absorbingly on its characters and is about the human capacity both for hurt and to connect with each other. Unfortunately when the plot eventually brings all three together Eastwood does it rather clumsily making the films resolution a little hasty and unsatisfying. Then again as I mulled it over afterward Im not sure what a better ending would have been. While ""Hereafter"" may not be Eastwood working at the very top of his game (that would be ""Mystic River"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"") its still a pleasure to watch. It draws you in it respects the viewers intelligence and it doesnt pander. And that compared to most of whats out in multiplexes today is close enough to heaven to warrant the price of a ticket.

As for accomplishment... a definite hmm. Certainly the movie peaks early as a CGI-assisted tsunami hits the Thai coastline where French TV presenter Cecile de France has a brush with mortality so close she glimpses the other side. Shes not alone as her ongoing fortunes complement those of a disgruntled San Francisco psychic Matt Damon whose gift has become a burden and a London schoolboy (George McLaren) coping with the loss of a sibling. Although winningly free of religiosity or new age mumbo-jumbo Peter Morgans script plays fast and loose in weaving everything together contriving a frankly ridiculous finale wilfully unsuited to the dramatic and metaphysical weight thrust upon it. Meanwhile Clint takes every scene at the same pace and ladles on his own mushy score. The result may not plumb Shyamalanian awfulness but if you did get to the afterlife youd hope they werent playing this movie.

It is true that the plot line is a tad slow at times. And the ending is somewhat peculiar. But there are moments in this movie that simply took my breath away. Yes the tsunami scene in the beginning is fantastic as we all knew it would be. But later on towards the end of the movie there are a couple of scenes that are utterly beautiful. (The french cafe scene especially) If you look at this movie for the beauty of the film making you will NOT be disappointed.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 16 2011FilmFanFeaturedI went to this movie with an open mind and actually quite enjoyed it.

Incredibly moving and cant believe very little hype probably due to big film releases like the Kings Speech. Totally disagree with a few negative comments regarding the young twins. I felt they were very real actors -not your Hollywood type coping with the huge trauma of their Mother. Also the cooking scenes were relative to the storyline and felt the characters were really building up to a possible romance with the sudden realisation that the truth can really hurt.

Terrible script unbelievable characters. The toe curling cookery class scenes with Bryce Dallas Howard are particularly awful and prompted me to leave.

OK not the character but Clint Eastwood the clenched-jawed actor/director/icon who portrayed the indelible inspector in the 1970s. And it should make a lot of peoples day -- not just those in the AARP demographic -- that Eastwood continues to do such demanding work particularly as a director. He can be counted among a handful of world- cinema greats forging ahead artistically even as they march into the upper reaches agewise Frances Agnes Varda 82 and Alain Renais 88; and Portugals Manoel de Oliveira who claims some sort of prize for still making films at the ripe age of 101. Since de Oliveira turned 82 he has helmed a film a year. Today ""Hereafter"" Eastwoods 31st feature as a director opens. Matt Damon stars as a reluctant psychic. Belgian actress Cecile de France portrays a journalist who has a near-death experience. And Frankie and George McLaren are London twins whose shared lives are severed when an accident befalls them. Written by Peter Morgan the film is a deeply compassionate decidedly secular and somewhat plodding meditation on what matters now and what lies beyond this life. ""Hereafter"" explores the yearning for connection the ache of lonesomeness the pinchy stuff of this frail existence. Doubt and hope in things unconfirmed is rich territory ceded far too often to religious conversations. Yet the film never gains the emotional traction that often comes from Eastwood who has a gift with the muscular the masculine the melodramatic. ""Gran Torino"" anyone? Damon has an understated kindly aura as George a professional seer whos hung up his shingle and gone to work as a grunt in a factory in San Francisco. When he grasps another persons hand he is connected with their loved ones whove died -- and they usually have something to say. Its too much information a burden not a gift -- though his brother Billy (Jay Mohr) would like to market Georges otherworldly talent. Against Georges wishes Billy arrives with a ""client"" Richard Kind making a telling cameo as a widower both skeptical and hopeful. ""Hereafter"" opens on a beachfront hotel in Indonesia where Marie Lelay (de France) and lover Didier (Thierry Neuvic) are vacationing. The impending disaster is based on the 2004 tsunami in which more than 200000 people lost their lives. The massive wave that plows over the shore and races down a modest town road where Marie is buying gifts to take home is an atypical use of computer-generated special effects by Eastwood. Hes been known to keep budgets modest and drama human-scale. Slightly cheesy-looking the scenes nonetheless make a persuasive point about Maries and others rag-doll trajectories in the implacable churn of water and debris. Normally fearless Marie returns to Paris with a lack of focus. Dreamily vague images send her in dogged pursuit of a different story than Didier and later her publisher sign on for. Across the channel resourceful and reliant-on-each- other twins Jason and Marcus (the McLarens) make a life for themselves and their addict mum until one of them experiences unfathomable loss. Screenwriter Morgan -- ""The Queen"" ""Frost/Nixon"" -- has deftly handled multiple points of view in the past. But as these characters head toward each other in the final act the resolution feels forced even saccharine. There are early signs that ""Hereafter"" will rely on some less-than-nuanced moments to make quick points about intimacy loss and possibility. In an aria of grief a black woman arrives at Georges door pleading to connect with ""my baby. MY BABY"" And Bryce Dallas Howard portrays recently jilted singleton Melanie who bursts into the movie and an Italian cooking class that lonesome George is taking. While the movies leads give empathetic performances Melanies romantic and culinary dance with George proves mostly utilitarian Look how painful it can be for both parties to date and have psychic sensitivities. Its a hurried too-obvious lesson in a film that wants to deliver more elusive ones.

Youd be right - but only for very brief moments in a two-hour film that at times seems like its gone on for at least four hours. For the most part Hereafter flatlines.Director Eastwood does his usual fabulous job investing the film with mood and detail galore and drawing affecting performances from Matt Damon who stars as a San Francisco-based psychic who can commune with the dead by holding their loved ones hands Cecile De France as a French journalist who has an afterlife experience during a horrific stunningly filmed tsunami and Frankie and George McLaren who trade off as a pair of young London twins with a deeper-than-usual connection.The tsunami is a good reason to at least rent the movie when it comes out on DVD Eastwood puts the viewer in the water with De Frances character as shes tossed and tumbled down a chute of roiling water debris vehicles and bodies. A scene just before the tsunami strikes as De France and other characters hear the water but still cant see it chills to the bone Standing in an outdoor market the doomed can see palm trees in the distance snapping and disappearing but dont yet know whats causing it.The clunker here is the script by Peter Morgan which for a drama boasts a stunning lack of that commodity in addition to anything resembling a narrative arc. The story hops around between San Francisco London and Paris with such rapidity that just as we begin to care about a character oh sorry gotta go check in on someone else.The script is so thudding and dull that at the screening I attended the audience howled with relief anytime a teensy bit of humor worked its way in. Bryce Dallas Howard wasted in a throwaway role that serves only to emphasize Damons characters loneliness (which we already got thanks) gets a huge laugh when her character in a cooking class notes ""The woman next to me brought her own knife. Shes very intimidating."" Yeah. Thats how desperate we are for a laugh. Or any emotion for that matter.Damon as psychic George Lonegan winningly conveys his characters deep sadness and sense of alienation (although hearing ""Its not a gift its a curse"" once was enough) but his Eeyore-type slump and self-degradation get pretty old around the 90-minute mark.Thankfully thats about the same time Lonegan makes an actual move - OMG Somethings happening - and heads to London where fraught encounters with the Frenchwoman and the London kids will occur. The last 30 minutes of the film hint at what it might have been if someone had whipped that script into shape; the idea of exploring experiences of the afterlife was a great one and Eastwood certainly has the vision to pull it off.But even the most talented doctor cant revive the really most sincerely dead. And Hereafter while not exactly DOA never makes it out of the emergency room.Director Clint Eastwood. Starring Matt Damon Cecile De France Frankie McLaren George McLaren Jay Mohr and Bryce Dallas Howard. Run time 126 minutes.

"Dont touch Matt Damon in the Hereafter. Slate Sign In Sign Up Dont touch Matt Damon in the Hereafter. Dont touch Matt Damon in the Hereafter. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 21 2010 602 PM Death Be Not Subtle Clint Eastwoods Hereafter. By Dana Stevens Matt Damon in Hereafter Theres something admirable about filmmakers who are willing to risk ridiculousness in an attempt to imagine unfilmable realms of experience life after death the subconscious infancy drug trips dreams. Even when the experiment fails-- What Dreams May Come The Lovely Bones--the attempt to deliver the beyond has a weird nobility to it. And on the rare occasions that such films do succeed--think of Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey Andrei Tarkovskys Solaris or Michael Tolkins haunting underrated The Rapture--the results can be transcendent. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Clint Eastwoods Hereafter(Warner Bros.) for me fell into the former category. Its vision of the afterlife--indistinct figures milling around in front of a white light--could have come straight from one of those basic-cable documentaries in which people recount their near-death experiences in between cheesy ""re-enactments."" And Eastwoods habitual preference for expounding ideas over developing characters often gives the movie the dull urgency of a tract (though it advances no religious doctrine and indeed mentions none with the exception of atheism). Still I found myself cutting Hereafter break after break thinking ""OK that scene didnt work but lets see where he goes next."" And this wasnt because Im a particular fan of Eastwood--in my view hes one of our most overrated living filmmakers--but because this movies earnest dullness was part of its charm. Im totally down with the idea of a slow-moving somber meditation on grief loneliness and death directed by an 80-year-old movie star. If only the movie had offered me more in exchange for my patience. Advertisement Hereafters plot (the film was scripted by Peter Morgan the British screenwriter and playwright who wrote Frost/Nixon and The Queen) proceeds according to the logic of what Ive come to think of as ""the Babel structure"" though this kind of sprawling international narrative no doubt preceded Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus Babel  (2006). Three separate story threads--one set in San Francisco one in Paris and one in London--develop similar themes before finally in Eastwoods case a good two-thirds of the way through the movie they begin to intertwine. The movies opening sequence is its best because it so matter-of-factly upends our expectations of what an Eastwood film should be. A well-known French anchorwoman Marie Lelay (Cecile de France) vacationing in a tropical location with her lover is out shopping for souvenirs when the beachside village is suddenly hit by a tsunami. With no warning--and blessedly no hokily suspenseful music--were plunged into a disaster movie and the victims-eye view as Marie is hurled along by a wall of water is truly terrifying. She nearly drowns is pulled from the water by rescuers and just as theyve given up on their resuscitation attempt she coughs up water and returns to life. But what Marie saw during those few moments between death and life--see above in re vague figures milling in a white light--renders her incapable of returning to her life as the successful host of a show called Window on the Event. The only event she wants a window onto is what happened to her in that tsunami. Meanwhile in scenic San Francisco--every city in this movie is identified by establishing shots of its most postcard-worthy monuments--a forklift driver and retired psychic George Lonegan (Matt Damon) is being pressured by his brother (Jay Mohr) to get back into the mind-reading business. Since childhood George has had a gift for communicating with the dead When he touches a persons hands he gets a clear image of the loved one that person is mourning and the ability to transmit messages on their behalf. In fact hes incapable of not channeling the dead which has turned George into a lonely hermit afraid of so much as brushing up against another human being. In an attempt to rejoin the world George takes a cooking class (taught disconcertingly by Steven R. Schirripa The Sopranos Bobby Bacala) and begins a flirtation with an enticing young classmate (Bryce Dallas Howard). And concurrently in London--see how long it takes to even set up the plot of this movie?--a preteen boy Marcus (played alternately by twins George and Frankie McLaren) longs for his dead twin brother. When his drug-addicted mother checks into rehab Marcus goes so far as to steal money from his foster parents to pay psychics to contact his twin. Hes scammed by an series of entertainingly inept shysters then discovers George Lonegans now-defunct page on the Internet ... And at long last more than an hour into this stuff the three stories begin to weave together--but the braid they form is maddeningly loose. The feeling of the last act is one of dispersal and fragmentation the plots energy slackening just when it should build. Marie wanders off to Switzerland to consult with a controversial researcher into after-death experiences (Marthe Keller). Marcus narrowly escapes a subway bombing perhaps guided from beyond the grave by his all-seeing twin brother. And George flees San Francisco to pursue his (never adequately explained) obsession with Charles Dickens. Eventually the paths of the three principals converge at a London book fair. I wont give away what happens when they do--except to say that the encounter between George and the grieving little boy is unexpectedly lovely and the one between George and the anchor lady unexpectedly lame. William Maxwell a novelist and former fiction editor for The New Yorker once said something simple but heartbreaking about death ""People die and then theyre gone. Ill never get used to it."" The characters in Hereafter are stuck at that border--the moment when someone dies and someone else refuses to get used to it or to give up on trying to understand where their loved one has gone. Though I found Hereafter meandering and occasionally sentimental I couldnt help but admire Clint Eastwoods ambition in taking on--headfirst--the greatest fact of human existence.Like Slate on Facebook.

By Peter Rainer Film Critic October 22 2010 Save for later Saved Actors Bryce Dallas Howard (l.) and Matt Damon are shown in a scene from director Clint Eastwoods film Hereafter. Ken Regan/Warner Bros./Reuters          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Clint Eastwood long a critics darling is perhaps the most internationally lionized living movie director. His new film ""Hereafter"" is also his most ""European."" Its trying very hard to be moody and intuitive and ruminative - all those things that American movies arent supposed to be.But the moodiness often registers as glumness the intuitions are engineered and the ruminations are on par with the metaphysical hoo-ha of say ""The Razors Edge"" a book/movie/remake of which I am not overly fond.The big surprise here is not only that Eastwood directed ""Hereafter"" but that Peter Morgan heretofore known for such wit-laced historical dramas as ""The Queen"" and ""Frost/Nixon"" did the screenplay. There are a lot of muscle pulls in this stretching exercise. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? It begins with its best sequence - a massive tsunami that devastates an Indonesian beach town and provides French TV journalist Marie Lelay (Cecile de France) vacationing with her boyfriend Didier (Thierry Neuvic) with a near-death experience in which she glimpses denizens of the great (and fuzzy) beyond. Shaken she takes a leave of absence from her job to write a book - ostensibly on former French president Francois Mitterand but as it turns out on the hereafter and the ""conspiracy of silence"" surrounding it. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Eastwood and Morgan have added two additional stories all of which converge not very convincingly in a grand summa at the end.The first is about George (Matt Damon) a reluctant medium who believes he is far more cursed than blessed by his gift for communicating with the dead. All he has to do is touch a person and - whammo -a connection is created.Despite the entreaties of his mercenary brother (Jay Mohr) George whose idea of entertainment is listening to audiobooks of Charles Dickens novels as he drops off to sleep is no longer accepting clients no matter how bereaved. He has become a factory worker who looking to find a social life enrolls in an Italian cooking class where his flirtatious cooking partner Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard) makes the mistake of pressing him to prove his powers.The second additional story which in some ways is the best is about Marcus a young English boy whose twin brother Jason is killed leading him to seek out Jasons spirit in an earthly world teeming with charlatans and indifference. (The boys are played by George and Frankie McClaren.) Little Marcus in foster care after being removed from his drug-addicted mother is palpably lonely. He wears his brothers hat and expertly sifts through the many Internet psychic fakers before deciding that George is the real deal.The three stories coverge at a London book fair where closure even happiness await all. Who said publishing is dead? (Or in this case undead.)I realize its bad manners to be flip about a movie that emblazons its heart on its sleeve. But ""Hereafter"" soggy with portentous uplift invites that response. Eastwood who also wrote the simple score inexplicably lays in (uncredited) wayward snatches from Rachmaninoff - specifically the second piano concerto that did such yeoman work in ""Brief Encounter."" He gives us glimpses of the next world that look like digitized outtakes from the alien embarkation in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Throughout the movie the sentiments that come back from the dead are invariably upstanding as if Hallmark had cornered the market on pensees from the netherworld.George a rather dull fellow may be racked by his gift but theres precious little psychological examination of what such abilities would do to a person. (I have a feeling it would involve more than cooking classes and Charles Dickens audiobooks.)The filmmakers have constructed a universe that is beyond skepticism or rational retort.This is their right but it makes for a rather tenuous movie experience. Its not that great movies cant be constructed around such themes. Dreyer and Bergman and Mizoguchi for starters didnt do a half-bad job of mucking around in the great beyond. (Neither did Shakespeare.) But the pained people with whom we are encouraged to identify in ""Hereafter"" are viewed solely through a misty spiritualized lens that often seems uncomfortably and unadmittingly close to quackery.Eastwood and Morgan are not con artists but their awe here is so unblinking that their film comes across as a transcendent con job.

One couldnt ask for a more epic subject than the afterlife and this jumbo drama weaves together three different stories from as many continents but it lacks the toughness of Eastwoods best work. The movie does begin with an astounding special effects sequence a British TV reporter (Cecile de France) visiting a South Asian beachfront community is engulfed by a devastating tsunami. The second story line set in San Francisco is held aloft by Matt Damons moody performance as a reluctant psychic. The third about a British orphan searching for the spirit of his dead twin succumbs to sentimentality and screenwriter Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon) labors mightily to land all three protagonists in the same frame by the end.

"Hereafter | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hereafter ) Hereafter (United States 2010) October 21 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its safe to say that as a director Clint Eastwood shows no fear. Only a few years beyond telling the story of Iwo Jima from the Japanese point-of-view Eastwood ventures down another little traveled cinematic avenue by making what is essentially a ""French movie"" (at least in terms of narrative approach and pacing) using American money and featuring a mostly English-speaking cast. And although the movie is imperfect and unlikely to achieve anything close to mainstream acceptance its refusal to court box office success exhibits a nobility of purpose. Additionally it arrives without a hint of the sanctimoniousness that accompanied the release of Eastwoods preachy parable of racial unity Invictus. With Hereafter Eastwood like a master at a loom spins three stories of lives impacted by Death weaving the strands ever closer until they touch. Seams occasionally show in the way the narrative embraces coincidence. It seems contrived - it is contrived - but its done with enough elegance and careful planning not to be too off-putting. If theres a flaw in the way Eastwood and writer Peter Morgan structure the film its that two of the three stories are markedly less interesting than the third which is revealed to be the ""primary"" one (or at least the one that captures the most screen time). Since many viewers will be more intrigued by one of the leading characters than the others this creates an inherent imbalance. Were interested in what happens to Matt Damons George and every time Hereafter pauses his story to return to one of the other two we become a little annoyed. George Lonegan (Damon) is a San Francisco-based factory worker who gave up a lucrative career as a psychic because he couldnt stand living a life that was all about contacting the dead. His brother Billy (Jay Mohr) who wants to see the gravy train rolling again considers Georges ability to be a ""gift."" But the man who believes himself capable of conversing with the departed views it as a ""curse"" - one that has robbed him of the ability to experience a normal existence. This is evident when a budding relationship with his cooking class partner Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard) goes awry once she learns of his ability and pleads for a reading. Marie Lelay (CA(c)cile De France) is a survivor of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami but she experiences death before crossing back over to life. The images she sees while hovering between the two states becomes the driving force in her existence. Given a sabbatical from her work as a television journalist she begins to investigate the experiences of others who have touched the hereafter and becomes a devout believer that the ""here and now"" is not all there is. When she expresses her desire to write a book about this she finds doors unexpectedly closed. One would-be publisher admits that anything she writes would be expressly for a ""niche market."" In the U.K. twins Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) are struggling to hold their family together. Social Services wants to remove them from the custody of their drug addicted mother. Tragedy strikes unexpectedly. While picking up a drug prescription for his mother Jason is run down in the street. His death leaves Marcus as little more than a walking ghost in need of closure. Hoping to make contact with Jason beyond the grave he begins seeking out psychics but it doesnt take long for him to determine theyre all frauds. Although Hereafter is a spiritual movie it is not a religious one. In fact religion is barely mentioned with an infrequent instance being a token appearance by a priest presiding over Jasons funeral (played by Colin Firth in a cameo). Like Hirokazu Kore-edas 1998 After Life questions about God are left out of the mix. The underlying premise is simply that life may continue beyond death. Hereafter does not function as publicity for any particular religious sect or denominations beliefs. The film frequently ventures into existential territory which should not be surprising for something that deals with material of this nature. It asks questions that most of us regardless of our religious beliefs have pondered. A phrase from Hamlets ""to be or not to be"" soliloquy - ""the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns"" - suffuses nearly every frame. Its fascinating to observe how each of the three primary characters copes with an intimacy with death. George is tormented by it. His relationship with Melanie which begins with great promise detours down a trajectory George is all-too-familiar with and we feel for him when he recognizes the cul-de-sac in which he has become trapped. Marie becomes obsessed by her near-death vision and frustrated when no one takes this life-transforming event seriously. Marcus whose entire life has been turned upside down cannot anchor himself. Hereafter is not the best focused of motion pictures but it features wonderful nuanced performances by the leads (one would be hard-pressed to associate this Matt Damon with the one who played the angry action-hero Jason Bourne) and touches on some fascinating issues. Its failure to plumb the depths of any of them is a fault as is the scattershot structure (evident especially in the films first half) but the movie is rarely not engaging. The special effects work although limited is exemplary. The tsunami sequence is noteworthy adding a ""you-are-there"" element to recreations of familiar home video footage. As far as the little details are concerned its nice to find an American-made movie where characters living in France are allowed to speak French. (Although this accounts for perhaps less than 20% of all dialogue.) In a way its amazing to consider that Eastwood the ""mans man"" best known as The Man with No Name or Dirty Harry is responsible for such a tender motion picture. However as his cinematic choices over the years have testified he has grown both in the kinds of material he is willing to bring to the screen and the skill with which he presents it. Hereafter is a fascinating absorbing motion picture but will work only for those willing to surrender to the story as it unspools at its own deliberate rate.

Starring Matt Damon Bryce Dallas Howard Jay Mohr Richard Kind Cecile De France Lyndsey Marshal Mylene Jampanoi Steve Schirripa Marthe Keller Niamh Cusack Director Clint Eastwood Running time 209 Release Opened Oct 22 2010  Editorial Review Across the Styx but never out on a limbBy Michael OSullivanFriday October 22 2010For much of its two-hour-plus length ""Hereafter"" plays like a smart and stylish thriller. Smart because of the way it pulls back but only a little bit from a full-on embrace of its central premise the existence of an afterlife for the human soul. Stylish because of its cool and bloodless demeanor. The world it depicts - our world the world of the here and now - is bathed in a deathlike pallor of icy blues and grays whether set in San Francisco London or Paris. Its a thriller because of the pervasive tone of dread and sadness. For its three main characters the world is a deeply haunted place indeed. At the center of the mostly mesmerizing but finally flawed film is George Lonegan (Matt Damon). In the script by two-time Oscar nominee Peter Morgan (""The Queen"" and ""Frost/Nixon"") which has been directed with admirable restraint by Clint Eastwood George is a former professional psychic who has shut down his lucrative Bay Area practice to work as a menial laborer. It seems that his ability to talk to the dead through readings is less the gift one might think than a curse. All George has to do is to touch someones hand and hes plugged into a parallel universe - a universe of actual ghosts and the ghosts of repressed trauma. These days despite his best efforts hes forever running away from skeletons both the kind in the ground and the kind in someone elses closet. Needless to say this makes it kind of hard for George to maintain relationships. The first time he takes a womans hand as he does on an abortive first date with a flirtatious cutie from cooking class (Bryce Dallas Howard) he immediately knows everything about her. And I mean everything. So much for leaving something to the imagination. But Eastwoods film isnt just about Georges romantic problems. Woven into that narrative are two even more compelling story lines. While on a vacation French TV anchor Marie LeLay (Cecile de France) almost drowns during what were led to believe is the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. This is the scene that opens the film and its a doozy of harrowingly real special-effects. Brought back from the brink of death Marie soon quits her job to research and write a book on near-death experiences. (The name of the manuscript ""Hereafter"" lends the film its title.) Meanwhile in London a taciturn schoolboy named Marcus (Frankie McLaren) is traumatized when his identical twin Jason (George McLaren) is accidentally killed. Marcus spends the rest of the movie trying to contact his dead brother or to track down somebody who can. At one point Jason seems to reach from beyond the grave to save Marcus from one of the London subway bombings of 2005 by knocking Marcuss hat off his head. Its these dramatic close calls - first the tsunami then the bombing - that lend the film an air of mounting suspense. Eastwood and Morgan handle them with as little cheesiness as possible under the circumstances. The tone is not one of skepticism so much as deadpan acceptance of things we may not understand. As the film proceeds however something terrible (or perhaps something wonderful) seems to be brewing something even more dramatic than whats come before. Something that somehow involves not only George and his ability to connect with the other side but also Marie and Marcus. It takes the film nearly two hours to get there but finally near the end of the movie all three characters wind up in London for what weve been led to believe will be a collision - or at least a fusion - of artfully woven plotlines. That fusion never takes place. Not at least in the way that Eastwood and Morgan have been hinting at in ""Hereafters"" deliciously creepy otherworldly build-up. George and Marcus do meet. So do George and Marie. The film is filled with such great little one-on-one scenes. And the best of them are between the living not between the living and the dead. But the big payoff fizzles. By pulling its punches by refusing to make outlandish claims about a world beyond this one ""Hereafter"" avoids the pitfalls of other supernatural thrillers. But its unable to avoid the even soggier conventions of the movie romance.

Starring Matt Damon and Cecile De France. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (PG-13. 129 minutes. In English and in French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) That Clint Eastwood has become a great filmmaker is something few would contest yet the nature of his greatness is as surprising as its little understood. You can talk about the pristine technique - the new film ""Hereafter"" provides lots of examples. But whats much more fascinating and enriching is Eastwoods Olympian vision the sympathetic and all-encompassing understanding of the pain and grandeur of life on earth. This vision is consistent in Eastwoods late work no matter who is doing the screenwriting and it boggles the mind to realize that this is coming from a guy who until he was about 60 was best known as an action hero. Make no mistake Eastwoods directorial output from ""Mystic River"" on constitutes the 21st centurys first cinematic marvel and ""Hereafter"" is among the best things he has ever done. Like Alejandro Inarritus ""Babel"" and Wayne Kramers ""Crossing Over"" ""Hereafter"" is an attempt to convey the bigness of life though a story involving disparate characters in different parts of the world. All three movies are responses to the interconnectedness of the world but ""Hereafter"" is by far the most successful partly because it has the best screenplay - by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") - and partly because it has a director who understands the difference between important and self-important. Importance is earned shot by shot scene by scene. Self-importance is assumed and is largely a matter of adopting an attitude and keeping a straight face. Eastwood takes us into the story from the opening shots. From a hotel we see a beach resort filmed with the kind of color saturation we might see in an old postcard. The effect is reassuring but misleading. A vacationing French journalist (Cecile De France) goes into the village to buy presents. And suddenly theres a rumbling the sight of a rising wave and within seconds buildings are washed away and cars trucks and people are all caught in a rushing flood. There have been tidal waves in movies before but what makes this one so effective (aside from being perfectly realized on the technical end) is that Eastwood stays with De France. He doesnt show us an overview so that we might get our bearings. Rather we experience the catastrophe from one persons terrified and completely subjective vantage point. Its as close as youll ever be to a tidal wave without getting wet. ""Hereafter"" features three central characters that have been touched by death. The newswoman drowns and is revived. A construction worker (Matt Damon) in San Francisco is cursed with an ability to talk to the dead. (If he touches someone he finds himself in communication with that persons dead relatives - so much for his love life.) And a little boy in London develops an all-consuming desire to talk to a recently deceased loved one. These stories play out separately then gradually move toward one another. Notice how every shot communicates something precise whether its plot detail or a thought or emotion. As an actor Eastwood is used to breaking up a script into a succession of specific actions and he does the same as a director. Such meticulousness serves his actors well and allows Eastwood to take his time within scenes and let them expand and feel lived in. He never wastes his audiences time because he is always feeding it new information. Eastwoods practical unwillingness to neglect any actor ends up giving ""Hereafter"" a humane essence Everybody is important not just Damon as the tortured psychic or De France as a breezy extrovert deepened by trauma. Thus the little boys mother (Lyndsey Marshal) is more than a desperate alcoholic and Bryce Dallas Howard gets to create a rich character as Melanie the psychics partner in a San Francisco cooking class - a young woman masking pain under a superficial facade that has become her personality. The ironic result of all this meticulous care is that we dont see Eastwoods hand but rather have the illusion that this gallery of humanity is telling the story for him. Its the most self-effacing way to do great work and its an approach that couldnt be more suited to this material. The films notion that people share a common destiny that theyre participating in some overarching order that theyre being watched over by a benevolent all-seeing understanding doesnt need to be spelled out. It has its analogue and expression in Eastwoods technique. He just tells the story and we get it. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune October 22 2010 -- 1014am Video (0223)  ""Hereafter"" finds 80-year-old director Clint Eastwood in a meditative mood. Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint There are reminders of mortality throughout ""Hereafter"" Clint Eastwoods gentle thoughtful film about the fragility of life and the promise of a life beyond. There are the cut flowers that are in sight whenever George a reluctant psychic feels the stirrings of romance; the blooms are beautiful but they wont last. There are the references to Charles Dickens who wrote novels overflowing with life but is remembered best for a ghost story. Theres the cap that young Marcus wears to console himself after his identical twins death. There are advertising posters featuring French TV journalist Marie whose image vanishes when a fresher face arrives on the scene. The story Eastwood tells here is about transience and how we deal with it by finding hope in the present world or faith in an afterlife. For a film that opens with a thrillingly realized tsunami ripping part a tropical resort and that makes key plot points of accidental death and mass murder ""Hereafter"" is remarkably serene. The tidal wave that nearly drowns vacationing Marie gives her a near-death vision of another world as she hovers in still water eye-to-eye with a childs comforting stuffed bear. The experience is half gift half curse. Marie returns to her glamorous high-pressure job in Paris but shes been irrevocably changed. She drifts away from that lucrative life and her social circle to research what it was that she glimpsed. The material comforts of her life are threatened but she cant stop moving toward that white light she has seen. George a genuine psychic views his ability to contact the dead as an affliction. It began in a childhood disease and has infected every one of his relationships. By touching peoples hands he can see their lost loved ones and learn secrets better left undisturbed. His brother wants George to exploit his skill. George working as a San Francisco forklift driver just wants peace solitude and anonymity. Ken Regan Warner Bros. Pictures Bryce Dallas Howard and Matt Damon star in ""Hereafter."" Marcus a London schoolboy unable to work through his grief after his twin dies visits charlatans whose hokum even he can easily see through. Fate brings the three characters together in a way that offers each one satisfaction. By bringing questions of eternal life into a realistic contemporary world ""Hereafter"" may raise issues of credibility for some viewers. The script -- by ""The Queens"" Peter Morgan -- makes a pass at answering these objections by introducing a rigorously scientific researcher who endorses the concept. Thats really not needed. The film works best as a meditation on the way humans embrace or reject the finality of death. In one scene a publishing house buzzes with excitement over Maries proposed biography of the late French President Francois Mitterrand. Later these stuffy French rationalists are appalled when she wants to change the project to a book about the reality of an afterlife. The editors are happy to write about the dead but the game-changing idea that the dead are still with us is too radical and frightening for them. The film is nicely acted with Cecile de France as the inquisitive Marie Matt Damon troubled and solemn as George and George and Frankie McLaren playing the shy Marcus and his outspoken twin Jason. The real star of the show however is Eastwood who takes on a subject that could provoke incredulous laughter and handles it with intelligence and restraint. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

De France plays a French journalist who dies is revived and finds all is changed.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 22 2010When Clint Eastwoods Hereafter ended the other night at its prerelease screening with the camera pulling up and away from a beamy Matt Damon and CA(c)cile de France there were bursts of applause. But there were also gripes among the crowd that the film was ""draggy"" slow. And who knows what the more-than-a-few folks exiting intermittently throughout had thought? Well not hard to guess.Which is to say that Hereafter an uncharacteristically sweet loping and meditative film from the 80-year-old busier-than-ever director isnt going to please everyone. With its wispy strands of guitar music its Shyamalanesque visions of the afterlife (blurry figures bathed in white light) and a performance from Damon thats muted to say the least the film is startling - mostly for the fact that this quiet cogitation on death comes from Eastwood.Its as if the cussin blue-collar retiree of Gran Torino accidentally found himself at a Kieslowski retrospective and was moved to the core by the late Polish auteurs reflections on fate and finality interconnecting lives the mystery of it all. Heck de Frances character a French TV journalist named Marie even has posters of herself plastered around Paris - just like IrA""ne Jacobs fashion model did (in Geneva) in Kieslowskis Red.Of course Hereafter wasnt written by Eastwood. The screenplay is the work of Peter Morgan diverging from his typical fare - politically and biographically based projects like The Queen and Frost/Nixon. Maybe hes the one boning up on Kieslowski.But no matter.Opening on some unnamed Indonesian beach resort where Marie and her TV producer lover (Thierry Neuvic) have been resort-ing Hereafter begins with a Spielberg-scale disaster a tsunami freakishly rising from the tranquil waves and flooding the streets taking out cars and shops and hundreds of thousands of people. Marie is one of them trying valiantly to save a young girl and drowning in the effort in the watery tumult.She dies. We see that. And then thanks to two bystanders shes revived. She returns to Paris and to work on the news show but nothing is the same. Her experience has changed her. De France recently seen in the French gangster bio Mesrine plays this profoundly shaken soul with a beautiful reticence.Marie represents one thread of Hereafters story. Twin brothers boys named Marcus and Jason (the terrific Frankie and George McLaren) are another. They live in London with their drug-addict mom and a death throws this already traumatized family into grief and loss.And in San Francisco George Lonegan (Damon) has struggles of his own He is truly psychic; if he touches someone he can see into their soul and see the lovers or the kin they have lost. ""Its not a gift"" George tells his brother (Jay Mohr) eager to capitalize on his siblings unique skills. ""Its a curse. I feel like a freak.""Hereafter loops back and forth from Paris to London to San Francisco from Marie to Marcus to George and we know somehow that the paths of these strangers will cross.Along the way Derek Jacobi makes an appearance (as himself). The genius that was Charles Dickens is celebrated. Marthe Keller as a doctor dealing with the paranormal or the supernatural or just the endgame of life makes a kind of silly cameo. And George takes a cooking class where he meets a bubbly transplant from Pittsburgh (Bryce Dallas Howard) engaging in a bit of culinary foreplay with the promise of pastas to come.If Hereafter is about death - and it certainly is (""What do you think happens when we die?"" wonders de France) - it is also about life and the connections people make. In that way Eastwood and Morgans movie with its epic natural disasters (and a terrifying man-made one) is optimistic. Hokey even. But its beautiful too.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + A t 80 Clint Eastwood has reached the age where he can make any movie he wants. Not coincidentally he has also reached the age where hes probably thinking a lot about death. And so we have ""Hereafter a multi-character melodrama about the supernatural thats affecting both in spite of and because of its flaws. Either ""The Sixth Sense for grown-ups or ""Crash for the credulous Eastwoods latest is serenely even masterfully eccentric -- the sort of movie that begins with a tsunami and ends with a kiss.Of the three intertwined narratives the most compelling features Matt Damon as George Lonegan a reluctant psychic with the gift of communing with the dead. Able to hear the deceased relatives of anyone he touches George skulks about San Francisco an exile amid the masses. Hes effectively a phantom himself and in a daringly internalized performance Damon moves with the caution of a man who can bump into other peoples tragedies at any moment. The heros shifty brother (Jay Mohr) wants him to go back to making money off his ""talent but George would rather work a faceless factory job and spend evenings listening to audio books of his beloved safely dead Charles Dickens.Some of us liked this story back in 1983 when it was called ""The Dead Zone and Eastwood accords his hero the same mournful empathy David Cronenberg extended to Christopher Walken in that movie. The director and screenwriter Peter Morgan (""The Queen) are after bigger game though. ""Hereafter is a drama about the mystical connections between not only the living and the dead but the living and the living.Two other story lines gradually converge with Georges. In the first an impossibly glamorous French TV reporter named Marie (Cecile de France) survives the apocalyptic 2004 tidal wave in Indonesia -- rather she drowns and returns to life obsessed by her glimpse of a blurry brightly lit afterworld. In the other Marcus (Frankie McLaren) an impoverished London boy traumatized by the death of his twin brother (George McLaren) tries to contact him by any means Googleable. This leads Marcus to a parade of charlatans and crazies whom the movie treats with briskly welcome humor. They may be nuts the filmmakers imply but were not.Morgan has been studying the playbook of Mexican screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga (""Babel ""21 Grams) and ""Hereafter zigzags between its plotlines with a solemnity that at times verges on self-parody. Yet even if Eastwood gives us a tsunami thats muscular and fake-looking even if his vision of the afterlife is banal -- even if some of the filmmaking and performances are surprisingly slipshod -- the directors profound interest in human beings under stress sustains him. This is a movie about people dealing with the Unknown A few seekers rushing toward it one man wishing he could run away the great mass of us simply pretending it doesnt exist.Its one of the latter who becomes the most heartbreaking figure in ""Hereafter Bryce Dallas Howard as Melanie a bright pretty anxious woman paired with George in an adult-ed cooking class (led by Steven Schirripa -- Bobby Bacala on ""The Sopranos). Shes desperate for a man and it shows but shes also drawn to the bruised tenderness of this man. The classroom scene where the two feed each other appetizers blindfolded exchanging personal details with the smoked peppers is a miniature masterpiece of emotional intimacy and Howard with her spooky eyes and long waterfall of dark red hair gives it a shot of truly weird eroticism in the bargain.You feel this womans fear and eagerness much more clearly than say the chic metaphysical serenity of de Frances Marie. And when it comes time for George to speak to the dead in Melanies past -- she charmingly pushily insists on it -- neither she nor we are prepared for what she learns. Coming at around the midpoint of ""Hereafter the scene is the films dramatic high-water mark which presents a problem to say the least.Still theres more at stake here than in Eastwoods last movie the doughty historical diorama ""Invictus and even more than in ""Gran Torino his farewell to acting and his own hard-boiled Dirty Harry persona. Uneven as it is ""Hereafter is a reminder of this directors most unacknowledged gifts a knack for guiding actresses (some actresses anyway) to peaks of emotional intensity and an understanding of the ways in which movies can approach mystery better more wordlessly than almost any other medium. To paraphrase Melanie tasting yet another amuse-bouche ""Hereafter is ""kind of nutty kind of sweet. Unexpectedly its all Eastwood as well.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Hereafter Eastwood racks up another first Boredom BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Oct 21 2010 (...) Ken Regan Matt Damon in ""Hereafter."" Hereafter"" has an opening scene to die for as a tsunami slams through a tropical port. Then for the next two hours several people who are haunted by death suck the life out of the theater. Chief among the mourners is Clint Eastwood who ladles a golden varnish atop his first boring film.Days after French TV journalist Marie LeLay (Cecilie De France) crawls from the wreckage of a resort town she has visions of the shiny-white afterlife she glimpsed when she almost drowned. Her producer-boyfriend advises her to take some time off and relax but she ends up researching and writing a book about the conspiracy to keep the afterlife a secret. Its not a secret to San Francisco factory worker George Lonergan (Matt Damon) who suffered a brain injury as a child and developed a capacity to communicate with the dead. Although he briefly worked as a psychic the demands of needy grieving people were more than he could bear and he quit giving readings.Hoping George will make an exception is a British schoolboy named Marcus (played by Frankie and George McLaren) whose twin brother was killed in a car accident. While his cartoonishly boozy mom goes through rehab Marcus steals money from his foster parents to consult a series of psychics all of whom are frauds. But when he finds a promotional website created by Georges scheming brother (Jay Mohr) Marcus is determined to meet the true seer. The fact that Marie George and Marcus all end up at a London book fair is the kind of coincidence that the script by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") peddles as proof of divine providence. Another is a mass tragedy at the midpoint of the film thats reduced to background noise behind the inspirational drivel.On those occasions when George is coaxed to contact the dead they tell him that in the New Age afterlife ""You can be all things all at once."" But whether the hereafter includes animals or extraterrestrials God only knows.In Eastwoods Holy Trinity metaphor ""Million Dollar Baby"" heaven is a place with really good pie. Now it seems that the 80-year-old director has had a vision of a talking head who told him that heaven is a place where nothing ever happens. Feeling lucky?

Hereafter Good Director Clint Eastwood. Cast Matt Damon Cecile De France Frankie and George McClaren. Rating PG-13 for thematic elements including disaster and accident images and brief strong language. Eastwood on Eastwood His 6 favorite films Cecile de France basks in glow of Eastwoods approval Eastwood excavates past in Hereafter Spotlight Matt Damon | Clint Eastwood Clint Eastwoods film begins with a stunningly realistic depiction of a tsunami wiping out an Indonesian tourist town a scene so immense youd think it might wash away all that comes after it. Yet it does not; the movie - patient contemplative thoughtful - is a powerful examination of loss and grief anchored by a quietly excellent performance by Matt Damon. It isnt a film fixated on death so much as what comes after and how that affects the living the type of subject typically treated in films as a theoretical conceit but one that Eastwood pursues with his trademark straightforward style. Marie LeLay (Cecile De France) is a successful French television journalist on vacation in Indonesia when the tsunami strikes its awesome power sweeping away everything in its path including Marie. Knocked unconscious she has visions while underwater of people in a gauzy white realm. Was she dead for a moment? She doesnt know but she does know that she is changed and wants to know how and why. This now is more important to her than the billboards her face adorns. Her boyfriend and producer (Thierry Neuvic) tries to be understanding but also has ratings to think of. Meanwhile young identical twins Marcus and Jason (played by George and Frankie McLaren) go about the task of raising themselves in London with little help from their mother an addict who often isnt around. But the boys love her trying to keep social services off the trail. Then one day Jason 12 minutes older and the focus of his younger brothers love and admiration is struck by a car and killed. Although Marcus is taken in by well-meaning foster parents he feels adrift and works his way through a series of charlatan psychics in a desperate attempt to reach his brother again. Across the ocean in San Francisco George Lonegan (Damon) is the genuine item a man who can communicate with the dead but has given up doing readings despite the urging of his money-hungry brother (Jay Mohr) to continue. Its not a gift George more than once says of his ability. Its a curse one that keeps him focused on death not the normal life he would like to lead. He works in a factory where hes happy. A night cooking class leads to a burgeoning relationship with another student (Bryce Dallas Howard); their scenes together are among the best in the film because Eastwood lets them play out slowly realistically and ultimately painfully. Eastwood bounces among the characters and stories. Maries is the least compelling though thats no fault of De France whos very good as Marie losing her grip as the ground shifts around her. What falls comparatively short is the path that screenwriter Peter Morgan (""Frost/Nixon"" ""The Queen"") chooses for her having her pursue writing a book about her experiences. Marcus plight is more compelling and the McLarens are terrific and quite moving in their depiction of him. Marcus is lost confused heartbroken aching for nothing more than one last chance to talk with his brother. Best of all is Damon who never resorts to melodrama when he reluctantly contacts the dead. Instead hes as matter-of-fact as a meter reader explaining what hes doing and carrying out his services with as little emotion as a translator which is basically the service hes providing. Damons portrayal is perfectly understated yet powerful. Its also sneaky; you dont realize how invested youve become in it until the final act when the characters stories merge in what seems like too much of a rushed coincidence. Despite that the best parts of ""Hereafter"" will stay with you thanks to Eastwoods assurance and confidence in telling the kind of story that could have been too easily relegated to the New Age cutout bin.

"Hereafter not a Clint Eastwood masterwork - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Hereafter not a Clint Eastwood masterworkHereafter 2 starsOctober 20 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic""Hereafter"" is a solemnly reassuring film made by major talents working intriguingly outside their comfort zones. Many love it and consider it yet another late masterwork from director Clint Eastwood. I think that sort of praise does a disservice to Eastwoods best pictures ""Unforgiven"" ""The Bridges of Madison County"" ""A Perfect World"" and ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" chief among them. The dramas problems begin to accumulate the second were hit with a massive computer-generated tsunami better suited to ""2012."" Somewhere in Indonesia accompanied on a trip by a plainly undeserving lover a French journalist played by the superb Belgian actress Cecile de France gets creamed by an enormous wall of water. The scene cries out for an entirely subjective depiction disorienting and scary; instead were handed an impersonally impressive digital-effects survey straight out of ""The Day After Tomorrow."" Returning shellshocked to her Paris TV job Marie is forever changed by her glimpse of what may lie beyond earthly matters. Meantime in London ... a young twin (played by both George and Frankie McLaren) is growing up in a harsh situation with a drug-addict mother and a blessedly sane and protective brother. The brothers sudden death sends the surviving twin into an odyssey that brings him to ... Narrative track No. 3 in which Matt Damon plays a troubled San Francisco psychic whose gifts have become a burden and whose innate decency is a fine fit for Damons easygoing authority. ""Hereafter"" takes the matters of sudden death and grievous loss seriously as it should. The writer Peter Morgan has said in various interviews that he went at this script intuitively without any sort of outline -- and without the historical-record background material attending his best-known works including ""Frost/Nixon"" and ""The Queen."" As the three story strands intertwine more and more tightly a viewer neednt have been exasperated by ""Babel"" or ""Crash"" to become a tiny bit antsy with ""Hereafter."" With his trademark blend of stoicism and savvy manipulation complemented by many of his usual collaborators including cinematographer Tom Stern director Eastwood refuses to pump up the melodrama. The man knows what he wants and while he has tackled all sorts of projects in recent years he is not afraid to restate his visual musical and tonal preferences. (Hes an auteur in other words.) The Eastwood-composed musical score sounds like the simple plaintive sparingly orchestrated music from any number of other Eastwood films whether the composer on those was Clint or his son Kyle. Visually ""Hereafter"" plunges Damon particularly into such starkly delineated (and frankly hammy) chambers of half-shadow half-light that Sterns cinematography verges on self-parody. Little of this would matter if the audience wasnt allowed to get so far out ahead of the characters destinies. Morgan and Eastwood are scrupulous in keeping their notions of the afterlife as general and inoffensive as possible. They have no religious or spiritual worldview to sell. As I say Many admire this film to no end. I found its use of recent tragic events including the London underground bombing to be more than a little cheap. Sometimes a major screenwriters missteps become exacerbated by a major directors dogged determined house style. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for mature thematic elements including disturbing disaster and accident images and for brief strong language) Cast Matt Damon (George); Cecile de France (Marie); George McLaren and Frankie McLaren (Marcus/Jason); Jay Mohr (Billy); Bryce Dallas Howard (Melanie); Derek Jacobi (as himself); Marthe Keller (Dr. Rousseau) Credits Directed by Clint Eastwood; written by Peter Morgan; produced by Eastwood Kathleen Kennedy and Robert Lorenz.

Hereafter (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Hereafter (PG-13) Drama about people obsessed with life after death drags. Cile De France and Thierry Neuvic in Hereafter. (Warner Bros. Pictures) Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald10/20/2010 Editor rating 2 Clint Eastwoods Hereafter is something of a departure for the plainspoken no-nonsense filmmaker In this movie for the first time Eastwood edges into themes of the mystical and the supernatural albeit with his trademark mix of melancholy and rue. Alternating between three storylines in different parts of the world -- involving an American psychic a French TV news reporter and a pair of British twin schoolboys -- the movie initially offers no connection between its disparate characters until fate and circumstance start to reveal a common theme. All the protagonists in Hereafter are preoccupied with the same question -- is there life after death? -- some coerced by tragedy others by a near-fatal experience or the death of a loved one. George (Matt Damon) who can speak to the dead considers his gift a curse and has turned away from a profitable business as a seer-for-hire instead shunning human contact and spending his lonely days working as a dockworker. Marie (de France) who almost drowns during a tsunami at the start of the film (a startling hair-raising sequence that outdoes anything disaster-king Roland Emmerich has ever come up with) cannot stop thinking about the shadowy shapes and corridor of light she witnessed during her few moments on the other side of the living. Brothers Marcus and Jason (the McLarens) are indefatigable in their efforts to keep their junkie mom looking respectable to child welfare agents until tragedy strikes. Hereafter which was written by Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon The Queen) and directed in Eastwoods usual steady (read slow) pace is absorbing in its first half as the film lays out the particulars of its characters lives and makes us wonder where the stories are heading. But eventually you realize the movie isnt comprised of much more than premise greeting-card wisdom and coincidences and its two hours start to grow long. The beautiful de France who proved handy with a chainsaw in the blood-soaked High Tension is graceful and compelling as the hard-nosed reporter whose view of the world has been irrevocably changed and the McLaren brothers make their own-screen bond heartbreakingly believable and desperate; only Damon as the weary clairvoyant fails to register anything more than mopeyness. But Hereafter doesnt really know what to do with its characters once theyve been established other than find a contrived roundabout way for their lives to intersect and many knowing smiles and nods are exchanged. Hereafter starts out feeling formidable in scope and theme but ends up awfully small and precious. What could have drawn the usually pragmatic Eastwood to such ephemeral twaddle?

Ken Regan/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Ken Regan/Warner Bros. Pictures Hereafter Director Clint Eastwood Genre Drama/Thriller Running Time 126 minutes Rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements including disturbing disaster and accident images and for brief strong language With Matt Damon Bryce Dallas Howard Cecile De France Derek Jacobi Watch Clips I Think You Experienced Death I Cant Help You Can I Ask You A Question? Filmmaker Clint Eastwood has been delivering a lot of change-ups in the past decade. He went from directing the somber murder mystery Mystic River to making the womens-boxing film Million Dollar Baby. Then he did a matched set of World War II pictures a kidnapping drama a film about racism in Detroit and another about Nelson Mandela and South African rugby. And as different and unconventional as all of those pictures are none of them sets you up for his latest film Hereafter an unforced mostly quiet meditation on what may be waiting for us on the other side of death. The first seven minutes of Hereafter mind you are designed to knock your ears back in ways no previous Eastwood film has. And they do. A huge tidal wave -- the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 -- slams into a resort where a French journalist (Belgian actress Cecile de France ) is shopping in a street market. The town is reduced to splinters and the journalist drowns. Gone. Lifeless. And then long after the rescuers trying to revive her have given up she coughs sees soft-focus visions of blurry figures backed by bright light and miraculously comes back to life. I wish I could say the same thing happens to the movie shes in. But after that startling disaster-flick opening Hereafter gets hit by a slow-motion tidal wave of afterlife hokum and you can feel it slipping away bit by bit despite Eastwoods best efforts to keep it on life support. His biggest ally in the struggle is Matt Damon playing an extremely unwilling psychic who keeps being approached by strangers who want him to do readings -- to put them in touch with loved ones whove died. Damons character is supposed to be the real deal. When he holds hands with someone even for just a second he can see whoever theyre grieving for. Understandably he wears gloves when he can but sometimes even knowing it will skew a relationship theres just no avoiding holding hands -- say with a gal (Bryce Dallas Howard) hes attracted to in cooking class. There are two other plot threads that will be woven together with Damons -- a bit clumsily -- and the folks in the other two have no such reluctance about exploring the other side of mortality. That French journalist who briefly drowned? She sacrifices her career to write a book about a conspiracy to hide the afterlife. The surviving half of an adorable pair of adolescent identical twins? He spends the better part of a year trying to make contact with his dead brother. (The boys are played affectingly and alternatingly by Frankie and George McLaren.) Frankie and George McLaren play Marcus and Jason twins separated -- for a time -- by Jasons death. Jay Maidment/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Jay Maidment/Warner Bros. Pictures And screenwriter Peter Morgan who wrote hard-nosed scripts for Frost/Nixon The Queen and The Last King of Scotland? He trips down a rabbit hole into sentimentality of a type hes not trafficked in before. Not that Eastwoods filmmaking isnt as graceful and unhurried as ever. Hes made this meditation on mortality stately and elegant -- sort of a Babel for the supernatural set. Theres beautifully shot globe-trotting from Asia to California to Europe and performances that are mostly nuanced and low-key. We hear from an atheist convinced by years of working in a hospice that theres something on the other side of death. And late in the film a character addresses the question thats likely to be on skeptical viewers minds by visiting a raft of phony spiritualists mediums and charlatans. Its as if everyone involved in the film figured they could keep Hereafter from turning ghost-story hokey by making it grounded beautiful and matter-of-fact. And it sort of works. There are no inadvertent giggles here; it just doesnt add up to enough after.

"Hereafter review Eastwood seeks meaning but finds only cliches |       NJ.com comments Hereafter review Eastwood seeks meaning but finds only cliches Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 15 2010 at 816 AM View/Post Comments Ken ReganBryce Dallas Howard and Matt Damon in Clint Eastwoods ""Hereafter."" What comes after? Thats been the question mankind has been asking itself since it first realized life itself was finite. Once my life stops do I end too? Or does the real me -- everything that made up ""me"" -- somehow go on? And thats the question that drives Clint Eastwoods surprising new film ""Hereafter."" It is also on another level the question he seemed to ask himself about his own career once he had created two separate equally iconic characters in Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name. Okay -- what happens now? Lately Eastwoods answered himself with the sort of films hes made -- movies that put him as a director in almost complete opposition to the sort of persona hed created as a star. As an actor Eastwood played hard-core heroes and ruthless vigilantes his heroes only attempts at humor erupting in smirking chauvinism and casual slurs. As a filmmaker he made war films that pushed peace. He made revenge films that decried vengeance. And he made dramas in which the toughest hero around was a woman. Movie Review HEREAFTER (PG-13) Warner Bros. (129 min.) Directed by Clint Eastwood. With Matt Damon Cecile de France. In English and French with English subtitles. Now playing in New York. Ratings note The film contains violence disturbing images and drug and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whittys review TWO AND A HALF STARS What came after Clint Eastwood realized he had become ""Clint Eastwood""? Something entirely different. And ""Hereafter"" is the biggest change yet. Previously Eastwood let his stories unfold simply; this movie like many art-house films interweaves three separate tales. Before his protagonists wanted something very basic. Here its far more intangible. One character is a woman whose near-death experience has left her wondering about the afterlife. Another is a grieving boy trying desperately to communicate with ""the other side."" And the third is a psychic who can talk to the dead - and is tortured by it. You dont get much further from cops-and-robbers and cheroot-smoking cowboys than this. Yet while you have to praise Eastwood for reaching so far a lot of this material remains tantalizingly beyond his grasp. As the traumatized French woman Cecile de France never engages us emotionally; the mourning child remains frustratingly remote. The directors usual firm hand with storytelling and performance wavers. Coming off best here is Matt Damon whom Eastwood had just directed in ""Invictus"" and who brings genuine anguish to his portrayal of an unwilling psychic. Yet his character still feels a little familiar and the directors visuals of ""the other side"" -- mostly pale blurry people looming close to the camera -- is similarly stale. Ken Regan Matt Damon left plays a reluctant psychic who can talk to the dead and Jay Mohr plays his friend in Clint Eastwoods ""Hereafter."" ""Hereafter"" is a handsome production. It kicks off with a tsunami which is truly horrifyingly breathtaking (and a tribute to an 80-year-old filmmaker still effortlessly mastering new tricks like CGI). There are a couple of good shocks later on and a small nice turn by Bryce Dallas Howard (in an awful wig) as a woman Damon briefly connects with. But this is still -- for a director whose work has been hit or miss lately and sometimes overpraised by critics with man-crushes -- a nagging disappointment. Its meant to make us ask ""All right what comes after?"" But it leaves real Eastwood fans only wondering ""Okay -- what comes next?""

Summit Entertainment By Joe Morgenstern Updated Oct. 15 2010 1201 a.m. ET Only in Hollywood is someone seriously old at 55 but this is the underlying thesis of ""Red"" and it works like a well-worn charm. Watch a clip from the film ""Red"" starring Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman John Malkovich and Mary-Louise Parker. Bruce Willis still buff and smirking at that august age plays Frank Moses a retiree quietly collecting Social Security until his life is suddenly threatened by a small army of intruders with enormous guns. Since Frank used to be a black-ops ace in the CIA he dispatches the would-be assassins forthwith. Then the born-again action hero rounds up the even older members of his old team to help him survive. In a stroke of creative casting the team includes Morgan Freeman John Malkovich and Helen Mirren ""Were gettin the band back together"" Mr. Freemans Joe says with quiet pleasure. Frank also enlists the help of an active CIA functionary played by Ernest Borgnine who at the age of 93 has achieved authentic oldness although he doesnt act like it. If logic applied Mr. Borgnines Henry a documents custodian would have long ago been retired from the job that he performs with the cheerful air of a cashier in a country store. But logic doesnt apply to a single tumultuous moment of ""Red"" which was directed with huge exuberance by Robert Schwentke and freely and frivolously adapted by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber from a superserious and ultraviolent graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hammer. (The title is an acronym for ""retired extremely dangerous."") Mary-Louise Parkers Sarah Ross a Social Security clerk isnt interested in logic either. In the enjoyably silly plot Frank whisks Sarah out of her Kansas City office and presses her into involuntary service as the teams junior member but she soon comes to think that he isnt old at all and she takes to the wild thrills of his cross-country mission like a salmon takes to white water. Ms. Parker is a graceful comedienne and its no news that Mr. Willis is a past master of delicate--yes delicate--self-irony so their characters generate welcome fizz in the course of a fraught relationship. (""Your eyes are so beautiful"" Frank tells Sarah early on as he covers her mouth with silver duct tape to keep her from screaming.) This cheerful bauble of an entertainment starts to lose momentum only when two-thirds of the way through or thereabouts the bad guys remove Sarah from the romantic equation for much too long. Thats not the movies only flaw. In what has been a consistently funny caper Sarahs removal coincides with a turn toward political melodrama in a setting that for anyone old enough to remember has chilling overtones of RFK and the Ambassador Hotel. Given that the movie was presumably intended for audiences old enough to remember things (even though it carries oddly enough a PG-13 rating) one wonders how such a script choice could have been made. Yet ""Red"" recovers from the chill with the steadfast help of its stars. (Among the nonstar turns that enliven the show Richard Dreyfuss plays a particularly brash bad guy with a mistaken belief in the protective power of badness. Brian Cox is Ivan a Russian diplomat with a romantic past and an encyclopedic knowledge of present-day codes at CIA headquarters.) Every now and then the senior participants in the proceedings offer nuggets of wisdom. ""Heres the thing"" Frank tells a remorseless adversary ""with age comes a certain perspective."" That may even be true but whats obvious here is that age in conjunction with talent can sharpen performance. The best part of ""Red"" is the spectacle of terrific actors being terrific in novel ways. Its great fun to see Mr. Williss swings between minimalist comedy and maximalist action or Mr. Freemans combination of suavity and warmth. While Mr. Malkovich has played nut jobs in the past Marvin Boggs the martial crackpot he portrays so gleefully here has an especially firm purchase on insanity. (When a bazooka-slinging woman dares to call Marvin ""old man"" the actors rage would do King Lear proud.) Ms. Mirren by contrast is almost demure in her approach to destructiveness. She plays Victoria Winslow once the sharpest of sharpshooters though more recently given to rustic puttering in a beautiful home. For a case study of how to put an inimitable twist on an ordinary line watch Ms. Mirrens Victoria tell Sarah about her true trade. ""I kill people dear"" she says with exquisite concision then adds a fleeting smile and a barely perceptible shrug. Its the little things that count. ENLARGE Bryce Dallas Howard and Matt Damon in Clint Eastwoods Hereafter. Warner Bros. Pictures Hereafter Matt Damon is George a spiritualist in spite of himself in ""Hereafter"" and one of three people in the film who have haunting connections with the afterlife. Unfortunately Clint Eastwoods slow-paced drama has slack connections with the here and now. Watch a clip from the film ""Hereafter"" starring Matt Damon. This supernatural thriller which was written by Peter Morgan begins impressively when a tropical resort is ravaged by a tsunami. In the chaos that ensues Marie a TV personality on vacation from France--shes played by Cecile de France in subtitled French--has a near-death experience that qualifies her as another member of the haunted trio. The third member is the youngest and most improbably affecting--a sweetly bleak-faced English schoolboy Marcus (Frankie McLaren) who has recently lost his twin brother. One problem that soon surfaces is the movies certitude. No Turn-of-the-Screw-y ambiguities no mind games about whether the three might share some all-too-human delusion. Either you buy their Vaseline-lensed visions of the hereafter or you watch in stony silence as I did wondering why theres no one to care about. Mr. Damon brings calm intelligence to his role and he has an agreeable encounter with Bryce Dallas Howard in a cooking class--the students take turns wearing masks and spoon-feeding one another in blind tastings. But even that scene wears out its welcome; it isnt as intimate as it promises to be and its pace in keeping with the movie as a whole is insistently slow. The cast includes Marthe Keller as a celebrated student of death and not dying and Derek Jacobi as himself giving a reading at a London book fair. Even he seems a bit morose. Conviction Watch a clip from the film ""Conviction"" starring Hillary Swank. This affecting fiction film was based on a true story. The key fact is that its precipitating event the conviction of an innocent man on charges of murder came in the early 1980s before the use of DNA evidence in the criminal justice system. ""Conviction"" which was directed by Tony Goldwyn from a script by Pamela Gray provides a showcase for two exceptional actors. Sam Rockwell is Kenny Waters a volatile resident of a small Massachusetts town who received a life sentence on the strength of false testimony. Hilary Swank is his sister Betty Anne Waters. A high school dropout and single mother who never doubted her brothers innocence Betty Anne put herself through college and law school so she could exonerate him and finally succeeded in her efforts. (The film pays tribute to The Innocence Project which was founded in 1992 by Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld and which helped Betty Anne to prevail.) The narrative is of necessity often predictable with extensive factual ground to cover. Ms. Swank in particular must work her way through familiar scenes of heroic striving although the script invites us to consider whether Betty Anne moves from heroism into zealotry at the expense of her children. But the quality of the acting is consistently high (Ari Graynor is luminous in the small role of Kennys daughter) and Mr. Rockwells crackling energy goes a long way toward compensating for the films predominantly earnest tone. His blue-collar bad boy--Kenny often got himself into minor trouble around town--has a wild streak and a short fuse but he always made people laugh. Some of the movies most stirring scenes take place during Betty Annes prison visits when the laughter has stopped and her innocent brother contemplates his shattered life. Carlos One of the high points of last months Telluride Film Festival was as I wrote at the time spending 51/2 hours in a darkened theater--with one short break around the four-hour mark--to watch Olivier Assayass shocking and edifying epic which stars the Venezuelan actor Edgar Ramirez in a phenomenal performance as the international terrorist of the 70s and 80s. Now that ""Carlos"" has begun a series of theatrical engagements around the country--the release schedule can be found at ifcfilms.com--I urge you to see it in a theater too. And see it all in one sitting as I did even though the theatrical version will also be shown in two installments and will be available via video on demand. Why turn a movie into a marathon? Because time may be fleeting but its mysteriously elastic as well. Once youve committed to an experience as intense as this one hours become much less than the sum total of their minutes. In my own encounter with ""Carlos"" giving up the required chunk of my life allowed me to enter the life of the film as if all other cares and clocks had ceased to exist.

Can a void be overstuffed? Clint Eastwoods ""Hereafter"" brings to gether recent historical events in cluding a European terrorist attack plus Charles Dickens and the after life without having anything to say about any of these topics. The movie drags yet it feels like its missing an hour. It features three characters on three continents who barely interact with one another. And after 130 minutes it stops without concluding. Matt Damon plays a reluctant San Francisco psychic who would rather work as a forklift operator than peer into the secrets of people whose departed loved ones inhabit their souls. In Asia and in France a famed TV newswoman and catastrophe survivor (Cecile De France) gradually accepts that she has died and come back while in London a boy (who is played by twins George and Frankie McLaren) becomes obsessed with what happens after death. Gradually bridging all of these gaps a la ""Babel"" Eastwood creates a compelling and suspenseful atmosphere of latent sorrows -- at least on a first viewing when you cant figure out whats going on. But few will want to see the film twice. Eastwoods style is all meatloaf and mashed potatoes -- in a piece that begs for eye candy confected by a David Fincher or a Zack Snyder. Eastwood is the kind of guy who tells us were in San Francisco with a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge Paris with the Arc de Triomphe and London with Big Ben. He plays up a line -- ""Its not a gift its a curse"" -- that no director could bring back from the dead. ""Hereafter"" contains perhaps the most spectacular scene Eastwood has ever shot -- and yet its still a little inert. The passage between this world and the next is portrayed with no more imagination than youd expect on an episode of ""Fringe."" Damon calm of mien and measured of movements spends the movie looking as if hes just emerged from a therapeutic chanting session. Though he has grown as an actor anguish is not in his reach. You might as well ask Woody Allen to play the president. Screenwriter Peter Morgan the cinemas court reporter of the political class (""Frost/Nixon"" ""The Queen"") is like Eastwood exploring uncharted territory. Why be so timid about it? It seems likely from this film and ""Gran Torino"" that Eastwood is a secularist quite possibly an atheist and he and Morgan tantalize us with the notion that theyre leading up to a God-free take on an afterlife. There is no follow-up though except for a clinical scene explaining that there is a lot of consistency in the experiences reported by survivors of near-death experiences. The script wastes a couple of scenes demonstrating that Damons character is vaguely working-class (for no apparent reason except maybe to provide contrast with the glamorous broadcaster) but doesnt explain why he can afford to live in Nob Hill. Class never gets to play a part in the story anyway. Nor does his fondness (which is brought up about five times) for Charles Dickens except as a rickety mechanism to get him to London to visit the authors house and cross paths with the other principal characters. The answer to the plots main question -- what will finally unite the afterlife trio? -- turns out to be ""coincidence."" When an 80-year-old director turns his attention to death you hope for some insight or gravitas or even whimsy or anger. ""Hereafter"" has none of that. Instead it offers sensitivity and a demure shrug. What would ""Gran Torino"" s Walt Kowalski say to such a limp and passive film? ""Get off my screen.""

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 15 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Clint Eastwoods tough-guy star persona has translated into his work as a filmmaker in several important ways the economic individuality of his style (untainted by the homogenizing effects of focus groups) and in most of his recent films an unflinching way of looking at the cold finality of death - the murder of a daughter in Mystic River a young athletes death in the boxing ring in Million Dollar Baby and the sudden hard turn at the end of Gran Torino. video Clint Eastwood premieres Hereafter When it was announced that the now 80-year-old director was making a film called Hereafter about death and the afterlife it naturally pricked interest. The results may surprise or more likely bewilder Eastwoods fans. The best part of Hereafter comes first as the film opens with a startling special-effects sequence. A French news anchor (Cecile de France) is on vacation with her producer/lover in Hawaii. She goes to a market to buy presents and astonishingly is immersed by a tsunami. We share her shock as the camera at eye level watches a wall of water engulf the village and sends her to her death followed by a vision of the afterlife (white silhouettes of people) and then unexpectedly revival. But now her old life the political concerns and conventional news stories have become meaningless and she is obsessed with afterlife experiences. A scientist (Marthe Keller) assures her that the evidence is ""irrefutable"" and Marie begins to use her journalistic clout to break the story Death is not the end. Her dubious book publisher decides this is the kind of thing more likely to sell in gullible America than in France. Meanwhile in San Francisco a Dickens-loving man named George (Matt Damon) is struggling with a psychic gift that he considers a curse. As a by-product of a childhood illness and subsequent brain surgery he can touch peoples hands and receive messages from the dead. While his hustler brother (Jay Mohr) wants him to make a fortune from his ability George prefers to avoid people and stick to his lowly factory job. A brief abortive relationship with a neurotic young woman he meets at a cooking class (Bryce Dallas Howard) underscores his dilemma. Can you imagine how hard it is to get laid when every time you touch someone you see dead people? In London a boy named Marcus (twins George and Frankie McLaren) is devastated when his twin brother is struck and killed by a car. When his addict mother is put in rehab Marcus is sent to a foster home where he spends his time obsessing about finding ways to communicate with his dead brother. A subsequent post-9/11 terrorist scare feels like a case of excessive piling on. Cant anyone in this movie die in an ordinary way? Blame scriptwriter Peter Morgan ( The Queen Frost/Nixon) wandering out of his comfort zone into an area already strip-mined by the Mexican team of director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga ( Amores Perros 21 Grams and Babel) and supernatural-themed television series like Lost. The viewer waits at first expectantly and later with increasing irritation as the disparate story strands are forced together in the ""are you kidding?"" finale. That said Hereafter is unpredictable enough to be consistently watchable. The cinematography is crystal clear and the methodical pacing compels you to feel the weight of the individual episodes. Theres an extended scene devoted to blind tastings in the Italian cooking class. The parade of phony psychics Marcus visits are amusingly theatrical and at a London Book Fair we are treated along with George to hearing Derek Jacobi read Dickens. Ultimately were left with the impression that Eastwood is far less worried about the hereafter than he is interested in the here-and-now.

"Movie review Hereafter - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review HereafterClint Eastwood explores death and the beyond through three stories with solid performances by Matt Damon and CA(c)cile de France.October 15 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Matt Damon stars in ""Hereafter."" (Ken Regan / Warner Bros. )Death is the barrier we cant get around an eternal void burdening those among the living who yearn for those who are gone. What would it mean if we could communicate with the other side or even just be sure it existed? That is the theme of the haunting ""Hereafter"" the latest work from Clint Eastwood which presents a trio of stories having to do with what might be on that far side and how it relates to the world we know. Over the years Eastwood has very much become a director we expect to deliver the unexpected and hes done that here. Hollywood once upon a time made films exploring these kinds of issues but in todays climate only a filmmaker like Eastwood determined to never do the same thing twice would have the nerve and the clout to take it on. Though its subject matter is unusual the compelling thing about ""Hereafter"" is the way it places spiritual themes squarely in the kind of Hollywood context that attracts stars like Matt Damon and top Belgian actress CA(c)cile de France. Whats surprising and satisfying about this film are its determination to deal with unconventional material in a classical way. ""Hereafter"" was also a departure for screenwriter Peter Morgan best known for fact-based stories like ""Frost/Nixon"" and ""The Queen."" He apparently wrote the script after the death of a friend and because it was so out of the ordinary for him put it away for years. Morgans script turns out to be a fine match for Eastwoods fluid unassuming directing style. His direct unadorned approach pares everything down to its essence the better to express the core of the narrative in the most direct and effective way possible. This is quiet but potent filmmaking that believes nothing is more important than the story it has to tell. Actually it is three stories that are told and ""Hereafter"" begins by providing a wonderful sense of uncertainty giving us the gift of not knowing where these tales are going and whether or not they will have things in common besides dealing with death and the beyond. Like the similarly affecting ""Never Let Me Go"" ""Hereafter"" is best approached with as little specific information as possible. The first story introduces us to a French couple unmarried lovers and professional colleagues vacationing in Indonesia. Marie (De France who appeared in ""Mesrine"") is a journalist who leaves her napping companion to get some last-minute shopping done. This small excursion takes a nightmarish turn when in a formidable piece of special effects work a orchestrated by visual effects supervisor Michael Owens effects house Scanline and editors Joel Cox and Gary Roach a Marie gets caught in a monstrous tsunami. Eastwoods team makes this wall of water and Maries near-death experience in it so convincing that it cant help but be deeply disturbing to watch giving us more of a sense of what being trapped in a tsunami would actually be like than we may want. So its easy to believe that once Marie returns to Paris she finds herself disturbed by what happened and her glimpse of the beyond. Next up is Matt Damons George a blue-collar guy who operates a forklift in San Francisco and yearns for a normal life. For it turns out that George rather like the Bibles Jonah is a man fleeing from his calling. In a world of fakes and frauds he is the genuine article a psychic who is very much for real and gets authentic messages from the other side. But having the kind of gift that leads frantic people to invade your life day and night can be a terrible burden especially when George meets a cute young woman ( Bryce Dallas Howard) he thinks of getting serious about. As he himself says ""A life thats all about death is no life at all."" The films third story is set in London and involves a set of identical twin schoolboys (George and Frankie McLaren) who run interference for their substance-abusing mother. Something happens in this family that demonstrates how the desperate need to communicate with the departed can take over the lives of those still living. ""Hereafter"" cuts back and forth among these three stories in an increasingly gripping way. Especially involving as always is Damon convincing as an everyman torn by the kinds of conflicts few people have to deal with. Can peace be made between the here and the hereafter? Its a question that cant be answered but few directors have the ability to explore the possibilities as gracefully as this singular filmmaker approaching in his 80th year. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview A Band Called Death documentary whips up...June 27 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesDeathEntertainmentJoel CoxCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-hereafter-20101015,0,3194144.story",200,hereafter26,hereafter,latimes

Pictures Matt Damon plays one of three main characters who are the focus of the Clint Eastwood-directed Hereafter. ABOUT THE MOVIEHereafter   1/2 out of four Stars Matt Damon Cecile de France George McLaren Frankie McLaren Bryce Dallas Howard Jay MohrDirector Clint EastwoodDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13 for mature thematic elements including disturbing disaster and accident images and for brief strong languageRunning time 2 hours 6 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY A tsunami looms both realistically and as a metaphor for the overwhelming surge of emotion rising from below the surface in the haunting Hereafter. A meditation on mortality the movie deftly interweaves the stories of three people in different countries who have in common their exploration of death and the mysteries surrounding it. This is no tale of paranormal activity. It offers no clear-cut answers on life after death. Rather it calmly examines death grief and melancholy packing an unexpectedly profound emotional gut-punch. Blending the mystical with the multinational Peter Morgan (The Queen Frost/Nixon) has crafted an intimate thought-provoking dialogue-driven story directed masterfully by Clint Eastwood. TRAILER See a clip from Hereafter EASTWOOD An interview that will make your day FALL MOVIE CALENDAR Search by title month There are a few glitches in this ambitious globe-spanning narrative mostly having to do with too much time and detail spent on less-than-integral relationships. But the main performances are subtly compelling. Matt Damon plays George a lonely San Francisco man who tries mightily to deny his rare ability to hear dead people. Hes somehow a conduit for the thoughts and feelings of the deceased an ability he regards as a curse. A good-natured man seeking to forge a normal life he makes a tentative romantic connection with Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard) but he cant escape his otherworldly ""gift."" Damon is superbly understated in the role. Marie (Cecile de France) narrowly survives a tsunami while on vacation in Indonesia with her married boyfriend Didier (Thierry Neuvic). After losing consciousness and sputtering back to life Marie is consumed with her near-death experience. Upon returning to her native Paris she abandons her work as a journalist so she can find answers to what she endured. De Frances nuanced portrayal conveys both strength and vulnerability. London schoolboy Marcus (Frankie McLaren) is stricken with grief after the unexpected death of his twin brother Jason (George McLaren). Desperate to connect and learn whether theres an afterlife Marcus delves into a world of psychics and charlatans. Both young actors give deeply moving and surprisingly mature performances. An early scene of the roiling tsunami is awe-inspiring for its computer-generated special-effects muscle. The rest of the film is much more contemplative. Eastwood never rushes a story even amid exhilarating action scenes. For some the unfolding of the intertwined tales may be too languid. But the narratives complexity has a quiet force that requires an unhurried pace. Our compassion for each of the key characters is enhanced by the measured storytelling. The idea has been repeatedly put forth that Hereafter represents the 80-year-old Eastwoods contemplation of his own mortality. Perhaps. But you dont have to be an octogenarian to be fascinated with what comes after life as we know it. Hereafter is a pensive saga that transcends death and lyrically examines our darkest fears and our most deeply held beliefs.

Hereafter Clint sees dead people | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesHereafter Clint sees dead people Clint Eastwood is in a Euro mood asking questions about the afterlife by way of three stories that may or may not connect.Matt Damon stars in Hereafter.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 14 2010 Hereafter (out of 4) Starring Matt Damon Cecile de France George and Frankie McLaren Jay Mohr and Bryce Dallas Howard. Directed by Clint Eastwood. 123 minutes. At Yonge-Dundas 24 Courtney Park. 14A Clint Eastwoods new movie begins with such a wallop -- a literal tsunami -- that its easy to assume the entire film will be equally overwhelming. So much for first impressions. Hereafter finds the 80-year-old American master in a contemplative mood fully in charge of his medium while exploring Old World styles and New Age paths hes previously avoided. Hes asking questions about the afterlife by way of three stories that may or may not ultimately connect. Eastwood has been around too long to take anything at face value but hes also wise enough to know that he doesnt know everything. First you have to get through that gasp-inducing opener which could beat any summer blockbuster going. Eastwood isnt known for big CGI effects but his computer boffins do him proud with a spectacular and terrifying recreation of the 2004 Thailand tsunami. It strikes just as TV reporter Marie LeLay (Cecile de France) a feisty star in her native France is wrapping up a seaside holiday with her boyfriend (Thierry Neuvic). If you wondered how it looked and felt on that terrible December day six years ago wonder no more. The water that pounds through the brightly coloured resort town seems so real it almost pours off the screen. It carries Marie with it leaving her for dead -- or is she? Later scenes in Paris and mysterious visions will help answer that question. A sudden shift in location and momentum takes us to San Francisco. There we find construction worker George Lonegan (Matt Damon ever reliable) who is struggling with a supernatural gift he calls a curse he can communicate with dead people. His brother Billy (Jay Mohr) wants to cash in by acting as business manager for psychic readings conducted by his sensitive sibling. George resists the idea but unemployment looms and theres a long line of people eager to pay him to talk to their departed loved ones. George seeks normality by enrolling in a cooking class. There he meets and befriends classmate Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard) who cant understand why George seems so burdened by life. The scene shifts again as Eastwood wings us to the London home of young twin brothers Marcus and Jason (George and Frankie McLaren). These sad-eyed lads live in constant fear of being taken away by social workers. They have to cover for their neglectful mother who is addicted to alcohol and drugs. An even greater threat will soon confront them all. The impatient -- and even those who arent --will start to wonder what Eastwood is up to. Whats with the cooking class and other diversions that seem to lead nowhere? What do all these people have to do with each other? He throws in another real-life incident -- the 2007 London subway bombing -- but this time the reference to tragedy feels almost like an afterthought. Like the European (or Latin) auteurs he pay homage to here Eastwood is in absolutely no hurry to pull his dangling story threads together. His sense of humor and that of screenwriter Peter Morgan (The Queen) comes through in a visit by Damon to the London home of Charles Dickens with particular reference to The Mystery of Edwin Drood the unfinished novel that Dickens was writing at the time of his death. Like that novel Hereafter seems a bit like a work in progress rather than a fully completed thought. You have to love how Eastwood neither suffers nor panders to fools. He assembled his cast not for its marquee value -- although Damon has a real following -- but because he liked the actors. He accents the drama with a minimalistic score with much acoustic guitar once again acting as his own composer. Hereafter makes no grand statement about life after death. Its just Eastwood pondering the subject as any thoughtful person might and inviting us to think along with him. Its hard to pass up so sincere an offer.

Joe Neumaier Thursday October 14 2010 400 AM Title Hereafter A psychic a tsunami survivor and a young boy are haunted by death. With Matt Damon Cecile de France Bryce Dallas Howard. Director Clint Eastwood. (207). PG-13 Language. At area theaters.The only thing more disconcerting than seeing an action-disaster sequence open a Clint Eastwood drama is watching the 80-year-old auteur channel M. Night Shyamalan. The straight-shooting filmmaking style that Eastwoods always had remains his greatest asset so reconciling that with the mumbo-jumbo in ""Hereafter"" is like discovering your no-BS uncle moonlights as a carnival barker.It doesnt help that Eastwoods laconic style is as torpid as it was in such misfires as ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" and ""Changeling."" A meditation on our obsession with death might be interesting if the film had more depth. Instead the lethargic ""Hereafter"" puts its faith in paranormal visions and spiritual coincidences and the result is an airport novel dressed up as a movie.George Lonegan (Matt Damon) used to do psychic readings for those wanting to chat with departed loved ones but after burning out on it he now drives a forklift in a San Francisco factory where he hides out from his ""gift"" (sorry thats ""curse"" as he says to his brother played by Jay Mohr). Georges paranormal abilities he explains to a potential love interest (Bryce Dallas Howard engagingly twitchy) go back to when he was a child had a fever and caught a fleeting glimpse into a world beyond this one.Meanwhile a French journalist (Cecile de France) -- who dies in a catastrophic tsunami but is revived by rescuers -- cant stop thinking of the mysterious figures and light she saw before she was pulled back to life. And in England a troubled young boy wants to communicate with his twin who was struck and killed by a car.All three are eventually united in a shambling overly detailed screenplay by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") that is itself haunted by memories of far better films and even by the upcoming ""Biutiful"" in which Javier Bardem plays a character similar to George. In fact Eastwood one of the most American of directors is possessed by a European sensibility here thats distracting as are Georges jarring cliched tunnel-views of an afterlife.Given those images its assumed the movie believes in the Psychic Friends Network its set up. Even if it doesnt Damon is miscast since as an actor hes always had a handle on down-to-earth guys. Damon does make Georges distracted 50-yard-stare intriguing; otherwise the surliness hes working from runs counter to the movies standard-issue hopefulness. Hes like the kid from ""The Sixth Sense"" all grown up and annoyed with seeing dead people. Or maybe thats just the audience.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Share Tweet When Amores Perros came out in 2000 it looked like an uncharacteristically arty variation on the spate of Pulp Fiction knock-offs that inundated video store shelves with gritty achronological interconnected narratives throughout the 90s. Seen today Amores Perros looks less like a continuation of the Tarantino boom than the beginning of a new subgenre that includes writer Guillermo Arriaga and director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus follow-ups 29 Grams and Babel as well as the Oscar-winning Crash. These films share a weakness for gimmicky structures but also a portentous tone and a sometimes unbearable eagerness to comment on the interconnectedness of humanity and the randomness and cruelty of fate. Late to the party director Clint Eastwood and Oscar-nominated screenwriter Peter Morgan try their hand at the interconnectedness-of-humanity subgenre with Hereafter an ambitious globetrotting drama about mortality fate and the thin line separating the dead from the living. Matt Damon stars as an unassuming young man blessed and cursed with the ability to communicate with the dead. Damons brother (Jay Mohr) wants to exploit his gift for commercial gain but Damon is ambivalent at best about his special talent. Halfway around the world meanwhile a glamorous French television personality (Cecile De France) experiences a profound spiritual awakening following a near-death experience and a spooky little English boy attempts to communicate with his dead twin brother. Morgans screenplays for Frost/Nixon and The Queen were clever to the point of being glib but the hotshot screenwriters facility for witty dialogue abandons him here. Hereafter isnt just unfunny; its positively humorless. In sharp contrast to the hyperbolic melodrama of Crash Hereafter is hushed and understated to an almost perverse degree; its so sleepy it borders on narcoleptic. Eastwood develops so little momentum that when the films three discreet strands intersect climactically it feels more arbitrary than revelatory. Just because a film takes place entirely in the long shadow of death doesnt mean it has to be this relentlessly dour.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr OUT OF BODY Matt Damon sees dead people in Hereafter (Ken Regan) B- Hereafter Starring Matt Damon; Director Clint Eastwood; Release Date Wide 10/22/2010; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted October 21 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT The great philosopher Woody Allen once said ""I do not believe in an afterlife although I am bringing a change of underwear."" For his foresight in travel planning Allen deserves a discount from George (Matt Damon) a reluctant psychic in the cloudy and tremulous life-after-death drama Hereafter. Much to his own dismay George is the real thing He can connect with residents of the beyond simply by touching the hands of those who come to him pining for messages from loved ones no longer on this earth. And Damon -- reunited with director Clint Eastwood following their work on Invictus -- makes a sincere low-key medium conveying information like a reporter rather than a precious mystic. Anyway George hates the gig. ""Its not a gift. Its a curse"" he says. This is why desperate to be ""normal"" the tormented fellow takes a blue-collar factory job in San Francisco. As written with uncharacteristic credulity by The Queens Peter Morgan and directed with an uncharacteristic lack of a center -- not to mention an uncharacteristic attempt to visualize the spirit world -- by Eastwood Hereafter positions George as one of a triangle of players destined to meet in the end. More than meet really The fates of these three are tied with an all-too-neat ribbon Babel-style. Life beyond death also obsesses Marie (Belgian-born Euro star Cecile de France whose whipped curls are bound for an afterlife as a beauty-salon reference photo). Shes a Paris-based French journalist who at the movies outset nearly drowns in an Indonesian tsunami and glimpses the hereafter under water. (Eastwood and company stage an elaborate extended terrifying tsunami sequence with countless dead just so the lady can live) Meanwhile over in London Marcus a shy and quiet solemn-faced boy craves guidance from his stronger chattier protective identical-twin brother Jason who is alas dead -- hit by a car. (George and Frankie McLaren play both twins.) Hereafter is embroidered with various small specific stand-alone scenes that zoom in on one or another member of this melancholy trio George is soothed by listening to audio recordings of Charles Dickens novels. Marie loses her competitive edge at work. Marcus with the eyes of an Edward Gorey waif makes a series of lugubrious visits to unhelpful charlatans before he Googles his way to George. But these episodes -- especially a brief relationship between George and a flirty young woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) -- dont so much accrue to a deeper understanding as pile up like a stack of sketches. (Or a travel diary The logistics for the production must have been epic with further stops in the French Alps and Hawaii which stands in for Indonesia.) And the signature Eastwoodian music that the director lays over the proceedings -- piano tinkle guitar pluck and an echo of Rachmaninoff out of Noel Cowards Brief Encounter -- cant hold the assemblage together. George Marie and Marcus have mortality on their minds. But Hereafter doesnt make a convincing case that they needed to meet in the here-and-now.

Hoberman Saint Clints Hereafter Meets Timothy Careys Greatest Sinner Wednesday October 13 2010 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman EXPAND Is Americas last cowboy icon prospecting for more Oscar gold? Taking for his map an original screenplay by British docu-dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen Frost/Nixon) Eastwood rides a sleepy burro deep into Inarritu territory. Multiple story lines cross international borders to mix personal tragedy with post-9/11 existential terror Hereafter is a mawkish mondo mistico obvious schematic and sometimes subtitled. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - As a movie Hereafter peaks five minutes in as a frugally staged tsunami arrives on a bright blue morning to trash some paradisiacal Pacific island beach. What follows is a lugubrious tale of wonderment An attractive French telejournalist (Cecile de France) parses her near-death experience in Hawaii while a painfully cute 12-year-old British schoolboy (George McLaren) with a substance-abusing mum suffers a terrible loss and a depressed Dickens-loving psychic named George (Matt Damon always game) wrestles with his occult power to read minds and channel the dead.""Its not a gift its a curse"" cries bashful George around the time he fails to predict his layoff from the anonymous job hes taken in a Bay Area factory. That his mercenary big brother keeps insisting that Georges ESP is more like a meal ticket is a hilarious inadvertent comment on the folks hoping that grief and loss will sell tickets to a supernatural heartwarmer like Hereafter. Among them executive producer Steven Spielberg who according to the press notes read Morgans script and exclaimed ""I know exactly who should direct this--its Clint."" (The good news furnished by the notes is that Eastwoods follow-up project is more congenial--namely a biopic of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover.)Hereafter is not just a stretch for Eastwood its a contortion. The irrationality of the premise is exceeded only by the strategic irrationalities of the plot. Clumsily self-inoculating against the charge of spiritual baloney-ism the movie introduces a formerly atheist scientist (Marthe Keller) amassing anecdotal proof of life after death. ""The evidence is irrefutable"" she assures the telejournalist while hinting darkly that an ill-defined religious conspiracy is preventing the happy news from reaching the rest of the planet. Meanwhile the telejournalists snooty French publisher (a product of the Enlightenment presumably) wants nothing to do with the potentially bestselling memoir shes written about her personal glimpse of eternity. He imperiously tells her to send the manuscript to America (and I know exactly who should direct . . .).Eastwood may have gone over to the dim side but when it comes to the bottom line no amount of bogus hocus-pocus is going to entirely cloud his mind. Hereafter ascetically eschews the expensive f/x that made The Lovely Bones so appalling. Heaven is presented as a bit of murky shadow play Georges visions are momentary montage zaps angels are signified by a simple if portentous pan upward into the sky. Hereafter may be New Age bushwa but its also old-fashioned movie-making. Indeed despite the plots dependence on someone Googling ""what happens when you die"" Eastwood revels in anachronism by staging the dramatic climax at the London Book Fair.Action bathed in soothing solemnly banal music (composed by the director) Hereafter dawdles along for 129 minutes stopping frequently to smell the roses and wonder where do all the lonely people come from? Midway through George enrolls in an Italian cooking course where hes partnered with the classs prettiest member (Bryce Dallas Howard). He may not get lucky but we do. Howards desperate flirtation with the camera provides a welcome distraction. Her giggling eye-batting bracingly terrible performance breathes life into an otherwise moribund film.""A bad actor is rich unique idiosyncratic revealing of himself"" Jack Smith once wrote. Timothy Agoglia Carey (1929-1994) subject of a 10-day retrospective at Anthology Film Archives was surely all of those things but he was not exactly a bad actor--this Brooklyn-born apparently self-taught Method man was more like a way of life.A scary presence onscreen Carey was an imposing palooka prone to upstaging fellow cast members by artfully flinging his body around the set. He had a shambling sleepy-eyed stance and the grinning volatility of a barroom brawler playing tough guys lunatics and chortling combinations of the two--although his career role was as a whimpering coward. As a performer Carey was unafraid to make a spectacle of himself. His earliest claim to fame was as a member of Lee Marvins motorcycle gang in The Wild One (1953) spontaneously opening a beer bottle and surprising Marlon Brando the grand master of on-camera improvisation with a shower of suds.However pissed Brando did employ Carey again in his sole directorial effort One-Eyed Jacks (1961)--or maybe it was Stanley Kubrick the projects original director. Kubrick had used Carey twice before to tremendous effect--as the racetrack hit man in The Killing (1956) enthusiastically primed to assassinate a horse and even more memorably as one of the condemned soldiers in Paths of Glory (1957). Unfairly sentenced to death Carey steals the movie with his smirky drawl inappropriate giggles cud-chewing line reading and sobbing cri de coeur ""I dont wanna die"" This embodiment of pure hysterical fear made Carey an underground hero and seven years later inspired Esquire to run his picture opposite John Waynes as a paradigm of the so-called New Sentimentality ""A minor character actor who manages to excite us in a personal way is a real celebrity.""Careys subsequent movie career was spotty but choice--a sadistic Union sergeant in Phil Karlsens A Time for Killing (1967) a version of himself in Bob Rafaelsons Monkees musical Head (1968) and a fastidious Marx-quoting mobster in John Cassavetess The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976). Anthology is showing these as well as Careys two most alarming vehicles the indie cheapster Bayou (1957) re-released five years later as Poor White Trash with an added rape scene (starring guess-who) and The Worlds Greatest Sinner (1962) a movie that Carey wrote directed and produced over a three-year period--while appearing in nearly every shot.The high point of Poor White Trash is Careys Cajun love dance knees knocking and mouth agape. This agonized mambo is reprised in The Worlds Greatest Sinner in which Careys bored insurance salesman becomes first a leather-lunged immortality-promising street preacher then a frantic rock-n-roller who bills himself as God and finally dignified with a paste-on goatee and campaigning against death the presidential candidate of the Eternal Man Party. Blasphemy aside his sins include sex with female followers from 14 to 83 gratuitously smacking his little daughter and stabbing a sacramental wafer to see if it bleeds.Fabulously scored by then unknown 20-year-old Frank Zappa The Worlds Greatest Sinner is far from incompetent filmmaking--its as idiotic crafty and unpredictable as Careys performance. Placing his satire at the intersection of politics celebrity and the media Sinner is thematically the missing link between A Face in the Crowd and Wild in the Streets. Its also a skid-row psychodrama to double-bill with Ed Woods plea for transvestite acceptance Glen or Glenda or Spencer Williamss stark morality play The Blood of Jesus. Perhaps someday someone will do Clint Eastwood a favor and show Sinner with Hereafter.1 Dont answer it Matt Its GodKen Regan Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

Clint Eastwood moves into risky new territory with old-fashioned grace and sturdy classical filmmaking in ""Hereafter."" An uneven but absorbing triptych of stories concerning the bonds between the living and the dead the 80-year-old filmmakers latest feature is a beguiling blend of the audacious and the familiar; it dances right on the edge of the ridiculous and at times even crosses over but is armored against risibility by its deep pockets of emotion sly humor and matter-of-fact approach to the fantastical. Oct. 22 release may divide even Eastwood partisans but the intriguing supernatural angle should help generate positive B.O. readings. The screenplay by Peter Morgan (taking a break from dramatizing the lives of British celebrities) quickly establishes three parallel narratives the first of which kicks off in disaster-movie mode French TV journalist Marie LeLay (Cecile de France) is vacationing in the tropics with b.f. Didier (Thierry Neuvic) when the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami hits. Borne along by the rapidly moving tides rendered with inexpert visual effects but a vivid sense of peril Marie hits her head blacks out and has an otherworldly vision -- all blinding white light and ghostly silhouettes -- before regaining consciousness. Meanwhile in San Francisco construction worker George Lonegan (Matt Damon) tries to repress his apparently genuine psychic gift fending off requests from acquaintances and strangers hoping to communicate with their lost loved ones. Finally in London young twin brothers Marcus and Jason (played interchangeably by George and Frankie McLaren) try to ward off social services by covering up for their alcoholic mother yielding unexpectedly tragic consequences. Eastwood allows each of these stories to develop in unhurried fashion always keeping the specter of death hovering in the background. Marie returns to Paris but has trouble readjusting to her job after her traumatic experience while one of the boys Marcus becomes eerily obsessed with psychic phenomena. And George in an unusually charming development joins an Italian cooking class (taught by Steven R. Schirripa boisterously channeling Emeril Lagasse) where hes paired with a beautiful stranger Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard). The question that propels ""Hereafter"" is how these three yarns will eventually converge (the answer creakily) and on the face of it this fractured globe-trotting tale of fate and mortality bears a strong resemblance to the work of scribe Guillermo Arriaga specifically ""Babel."" But while the film trades in too many coincidences -- suffice it to say the tsunami is not the only real-world disaster invoked -- the mitigating charm of Eastwoods approach is how subdued unportentous and laid-back it is. He seems in no hurry to establish the missing links trusting us to engage with the characters before we know exactly how they fit together. As though aware of the raised eyebrows that may greet his borderline-schlocky choice of material Eastwood pauses midway through to register a healthy measure of skepticism; a montage shows one character consulting a series of psychics every one of them a charlatan. Even still were meant to take it on faith that Damons George is the real deal (his gifts are even given a biological explanation) and the film presents his frequent glimpses of the netherworld -- similar to Maries near-death visions -- in an unquestioning manner that viewers will have to either accept or reject. As unabashedly suffused with emotion as any of Eastwoods films ""Hereafter"" is finally less interested in addressing lifes great mysteries than in offering viewers the soothing balm of catharsis; the portal to the beyond as conceived here serves merely as a practical gateway into inner peace romantic renewal and most consolingly the reassurance that our loved ones never leave us. This sentiment is conveyed when George reluctantly performs a reading for Melanie all the more powerful for its apparent disconnection from the rest of the story. The fact that much of the film is set in Europe lends it a unique look and texture in the helmers oeuvre; Tom Sterns camera at times pulls back to take in the varied landscapes but bathes many of the interiors in his customary inky blacks the intense chiaroscuro serving to up the hushed spiritual quality of the films most intimate moments. As usual Eastwoods score is a tad overinsistent if melodically spare its few notes reiterated on various instruments (including piano guitar and harmonica) and supplemented here by snippets of Rachmaninoff. Damon and de France (toplining her first major studio picture) are sympathetic enough as characters who are more or less at the mercy of the cosmos while the brothers McLaren eventually cast off their Dickensian-moppet shackles particularly in the final reel. But its Howard whose relatively brief presence really lingers her performance starting off goofy and ingratiating before taking on an almost otherworldly intensity.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Other Side of Clint Hereafter speaking through dead people says a lot about Eastwood the director. By David Edelstein Published Oct 8 2010 ShareThis (Photo Ken Regan/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Clint Eastwoods supernatural drama Hereafter starts big and ends small its hold gradually slackening its thread dissolving. To be honest it never had much of a thread. The film introduces three main characters in three different countries cutting among them more or less at random laying the groundwork for what we hope will be a killer last act in which they all come together and what? Cross over to the other side? Welcome the dead in a Close Encounters mother ship? No its not that kind of movie. Hereafter occupies some muzzy twilight zone too woo-woo sentimental to be real too limp to make for even a halfway decent ghost story. The picture has one indisputably boffo scene and it comes at the start A tsunami smashes into a Southeast Asian beach resort sweeping through the town and carrying off (among many others) a French TV reporter Marie (Cecile de France) who gets conked on the head and appears to die. Its an amazing piece of filmmaking and not just because of the special effects. Eastwoods camera remains at street level watching the wave as it rushes closer and closer getting picked up and carried along with Marie. The sequence is such a tour de force that its heartbreaking when Mariewhos not dead but not not-deadhas a vision of the afterlife that looks like the old TV promos for Lost with actors (in this case all streaky and whited-out) at various distances staring into the camera. It gets so tacky so fast. In San Francisco meanwhile Matt Damons George abandons a lucrative career as a John Edwardstyle medium because he cant handle the pressure that comes with being a conduit to the hereafter. Although he sounds like a typically bogus cold readerIm seeing a woman with dark hair Is that right?hes supposed to be the real McCoy a man who can grasp someones hand and see those blurry Lost promos. The final protagonist is Marcus (played by both George and Frankie McLaren) a working-class London boy whose twin brother Jason (also played by George and Frankiea curious casting gimmick that pays off) gets chased by bullies into the street and run over by a car. Snatched away from his junkie mom and placed in foster care the bereft Marcus who always let Jason make the decisions Googles in anguish for someone to help him talk to his brother preferably on a daily basis. A couple of clicks and theres George. Peter Morgan (The Queen Frost/Nixon) said he wrote Hereafter after losing a close friend and longingas we all do at some pointto make contact with the other side. That of course is how unscrupulous charlatans earn seven-figure incomes. But while Morgan is careful to show us some phoniescold readers asking questions that are bound to elicit hitshes firmly in the camp that says Hey its possible. Given that early in the film the existence of an afterlife is firmly established and Georges powers are proved authentic theres little left for the movie to do but bring him and Marcus and Marie (now also plagued by Lost promos) together. And thats exactly what happensin about an hour. As usual with Eastwood the performances are all over the map. Damon is so self-effacing you can almost see Eastwoods visage superimposed over his the mole supernaturally shifted from the right side to the left. A long section of the film centers on George and an effusive young woman he meets in an Italian cooking class which is meant to show how his links to the dead inevitably sabotage his connection with the living. But watching Bryce Dallas Howard madly overactshe looks like she wants to ravish him over his cutting boardwhile Damon stares at her in a semi-stupor you wonder if the scene is meant to be played as farce. The final scene in which George is suddenly able to see the future as well as the dead is just plain bewildering. My impression is that Eastwoodwhile revered by many as a premier auteur with a strong personal visionpicks scripts he likes and shoots them pretty much as they are; and when a script is like Morgans badly in need of a polish and minus a satisfying windup hell shoot it anyway and figure the lapses will be viewed as powerful artistic choices attributable to his laid-back jazz-inflected style. That seems to be the case with Hereafter which closed the New York Film Festival and has already been hailed as a masterly summing-up of his long careeralthough what Morgans first-draft stab at a crossing-over weepie has to do with the rest of Eastwoods oeuvre is a mystery as unfathomable as what happens after death. 1 2 Next Share this story...

A tsunami gathers force in its path toward an Asian beach resort swatting a large ship as if it were a toy boat. Then it crashes on shore and pours through the town. Special-effects experts know that water is among the hardest computer-generated elements to render accurately but this tsunamis power is utterly plausible. At Hereafters world-premiere screening on Sunday at the Toronto Film Festival the 1500 spectators in the Elgin Theatre gasped as one -- one frightened enthralled child at the ultimate Saturday matinee. What they saw was a scene whose editing builds the tsunami horror with urgency and clarity. It inundates viewers in the larger disaster while assuring that they keep track of the two characters they already know Marie (Cecile de France) a popular anchorwoman on French TV whos shopping in the resort village when the wave breaks and is swept away in the churning tide and her boss and lover (Thierry Neuvic) back at their hotel. Marie is pulled underwater but surfaces and seems to have survived when --Whack -- she is knocked out. As she loses consciousness she has a near blinding glimpse of shadowy figures in a tableau of radiance. She is thrown ashore where two men desperately try to revive her without success. A minute later she spits out water. If she were dead then shes back with the living now. (See TIMEs Fall Entertainment Preview 2010.) Eastwood movies dont usually boast moments like this a CGI action scene so brilliantly managed that Michael Bay could only dream of having it on his resume. Was the tsunami sequence mostly the work of second-unit directors and effects wizards? Or did Steven Spielberg one of Hereafters executive producers lend his legendary gift for painting grand canvases of disaster that also show an acute attention to human detail? Even if the scene were all Eastwoods doing it launches the movie with a wondrous blend of art technique and entertainment. And it has almost nothing in common with the pensive sprawling supernatural narrative that follows. At a slim graceful 80 and at the end of the most acclaimed decade of his long and lauded career (with Academy Awards as director and producer of Million Dollar Baby plus five more Oscar nominations for Baby Mystic River and Letters from Iwo Jima) Eastwood has nothing to prove. Yet in Toronto he sounded a little defensive about his films laconic style. As he told Andrea Baillie of the Canadian Press ""In this MTV generation that we live in I think its something that I still like to embrace that we actually unfold the stories and get to know the people and get to know a little more detail about them rather than play to the common denominator or the lack of attention span that sometimes people feel goes on now."" Hereafter is a daunting test for the video-game crowd -- and for more patient viewers a film of mixed rewards and challenges. (See TIMEs photo-essay on Clint Eastwood turning 80.) The script is by Peter Morgan best known for dissecting British royalty (The Queen The Other Boleyn Girl and on TV Henry VII) American Presidents (Frost/Nixon) and African tyrants (The Last King of Scotland). No one in Hereafter has a title; the three main figures are ordinary people with unusual abilities and startling visions. Marie after her tsunami trauma has difficulty concentrating on her anchor duties; taking a leave from the show she feels compelled to write a book about near death experiences. In San Francisco George (Matt Damon) a psychic with an apparently genuine knack for connecting people with dead relatives is cropped by his gift and leaves town fleeing his entrepreneur brother (Jay Mohr) and a potential girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard). In London 11-year-old twins Jason and Marcus (George and Frankie McLaren) give moral support to their wayward mother (Niamh Cusack). When Jason is flattened and killed by an onrushing truck Marcus is left alone with nothing but his dead twins ashes and cap to comfort him and perhaps speak to him. (See the 100 best movies of all time.) Eastwood the director is as he acknowledges a man with a slow hand. He lets the story play out at a measured pace. Rather than fiddling with scripts he shoots them pretty much as written (which is why screenwriters love him). If theres inherent drama in the work it will emerge; if not scenes can lie there like a row of carp at San Franciscos Sun Fast Seafood Co. Hereafter has a few of these longueurs the disintegration of Maries affair with her producer; Georges budding romance (Howard who can be a winning actress undercuts her character here with giggling and nervous tics); Marcus travails in a foster home after his mother gives him up. A half-hour cut from the films middle portion would enhance the mystery and the mood. But even in this section the movie has its privileged moments. Marcus adventure in the Charing Cross underground station is one to savor a crowded platform an elusive cap lives abruptly ended and another one saved. Like the tsunami scene it boasts deft editing and a killer climax. Damon more comfortable here than as the South African rugby star in Eastwoods Invictus gives a marvelously understated reading of George a man whose gift is a curse whose unquiet mind is tormented by the deaths and afterlives of strangers. De France so impressive in the role of the crime lords girlfriend in Mesrine Killer Instinct has to be both tough and vulnerable as Marie and she adroitly balances her characters conflicts afflictions and dreams. The fates of Marie and George and of Marcus too are destined to converge. This involves as much coincidence as supernatural manipulation; but the payoff could leave viewers in tears. Or not. The movie will divide some Eastwood fans conquer others. The naysayers will be grateful that from this healthy workaholic actor-director there is always the promise of a good movie -- if not here then hereafter. But if you go with his new pictures slow flow and stick around for its rapturous resolution youll see this as a summing up a final testament of so many Clint characters from The Man with No Name to Dirty Harry from Million Dollar Babys Frankie Dunn to Gran Torinos Walt Kowalski for all of whom facing down death was a natural part of life. For Eastwood and viewers in synch with his mature melancholy worldview the hereafter is now. See the top 10 movie re-releases. See the top 10 movie duels.

Daily Edition Login to download Hereafter Film Review 1018 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS ""Hereafter"" Courtesy of Warner Brothers Another strong and unexpected drama from Clint Eastwood. TWITTER TORONTO -- Clint Eastwood continues his search for challenging stories that delve into extreme reaches of the human condition in ""Hereafter"" a globetrotting inquiry into the nature of the afterlife. The film also marks an unexpected turn in the screenwriting of Peter Morgan away from his survey of political personalities in such films as ""The Queen"" and ""Frost/Nixon"" and into metaphysical speculation. The film never is less than intriguing right from its tour de force opening sequence and often full of insights into why people long for answers sometimes with great urgency. By now Eastwood has established a reputation for the unexpected so his admirers -- ""fans"" no longer seems the right word -- plus anyone curious about the subject matter certainly will line up when Warner Bros. releases the film domestically Oct. 22. The film should do very well in Europe next year as well. One would expect such subjects as mortality and the afterlife would mean a contemplative even moody piece. But Morgan has planted a sense of immediacy within these international stories about three people searching for answers. Strange as it sounds the film reminds a little of old Claude Lelouch movies -- and not just because Marthe Keller looking wonderful shows up in one sequence -- because Morgans story plays with fate and destiny as peoples paths eventually cross after incidents in different parts of the world send them on a collision course. A tsunami tears through a tropical beach town causing a French television news anchor (Cecile de France) to have a near-death experience. An otherwise normal American (Matt Damon) desperately wants to flee his ""curse"" a psychic ability to communicate with the dead. Two twin boys in London are inseparable until they are separated by death leaving the shyer more dependent brother (Frankie McLaren) desperate to reach beyond the grave for assurance. Each story has its own subplots and captivating characters. The French woman something of a celebrity is in a relationship with her married producer (Thierry Neuvic). The experience has so shaken her that he suggests she take time off to write a political book. She does but her writing veers off course as she investigates scientists who research the afterlife and the stigma attached to their work. The psychic aches to get out of the ""reading"" business but his brother (Jay Mohr) knows a gold mine when he sees it and a fledgling relationship with a bright pretty woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) falls apart because of his unwanted ability. The twins mother (Lyndsey Marshal) is a junkie. Following the death of the ""older"" brother (George McLaren) social workers and even the mother finally agree that his brother must go into foster care while she rehabs. It couldnt happen at a worse time for the lad. All three stories have a sense of urgency these are people tormented by the inexplicable. Eastwood establishes their stress but never hurries the film. Many absorbing moments dot the movie that luxuriate in situations and details such as a cooking class where the psychic meets a potential lover or a London Underground sequence where an enigmatic event rescues the brother. Eastwoods actors underplay what has potential for hokey melodrama. Indeed the film nimbly maneuvers through territory few American films enter. Perhaps for good reason Remember the debacle of ""What Dreams May Come?"" Even with all this the ending is a letdown. Its too facile too ... well Lelouch as a matter of fact. One wants a film dealing with the ultimate metaphysical issue to end on a more profound note than the finish Morgan comes up with. However it certainly will give audiences something to debate on the way home. As with ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" Eastwood has made a movie that shakes up the whole notion of what studio movies can be. A final note Eastwoods lilting musical score is among his best. Venue Toronto International Film Festival (Warner Bros.)
