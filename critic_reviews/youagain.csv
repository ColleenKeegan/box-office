On one level its a cosy unashamedly bourgeois all-American wedding movie. On another its a fever-pitch psychodrama about guilt self-loathing and emotional terrorism crammed with loopy cameos and frenzied slapstick. This must be one of the weirdest films ever to bear the Disney brand.Kristen Bell plays Marni a geek-turned-goddess who is horrified to learn that her beloved big brother is about to marry the uber-bitch Joanna (Odette Yustman) who made her high-school life a living hell. So far so ordinary - until the arrival of said psychos aunt Ramona (Sigourney Weaver) who happens to have a similar history with Marnis seemingly ordinary suburban Mom Gail (Jamie Lee Curtis).The presence of these two acting powerhouses plus the surely-not-coincidental similarity between our heroines name and that of Hitchcocks most disturbed heroine should give audiences a fair idea of what to expect. Yes this is shrill crass mainstream Hollywood product but it has a tendency towards lurid kitsch freakout which makes it not just relentlessly entertaining but borderline subversive.

Weve met before. The pratfalls the unlikely coincidences the matrimonial hijinks the forced jollity of an Olive Garden commercial are all strikingly familiar in this prefab comedy. Kristen Bell makes exasperated squirrel-faces as Marni an ugly duckling who discovers to her horror that her brother is about to marry her high-school tormentor. Marnis efforts to drive them apart run through a gamut of tired sitcom gags but while the rest of this vehicle is on cruise control Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver have plenty of fun in the backseat as Marnis mother and the bride-to-bes aunt a pair whose own adolescent rivalry bubbles to the surface during the wedding preparations. The veteran actresses easy rapport and sheer exuberance are the only real fresh spots in a story youll recognize from a mile away.

Share Tweet If theres one thing to be gleaned from the Betty White renaissance of the last year--besides confirmation that everyone enjoys salty old ladies--its that if you work hard and long enough at something you do better than anyone else youll earn not just respect but love. White has been in the business a long time and seen as many ups and downs as any veteran out there. And its not as if the ups were handed to her. Other performers would have made some of her Golden Girls lines to choose one example ring like tin. Shes great at what she does and you can hear the instincts of a pro seizing on just the right delivery in You Again when speaking of muscle relaxants for her back pain she says ""One of those babies and shell be able to taste sunlight."" Funny on paper it isnt but White makes it work. Still even the best performers can only do so much to elevate mediocre material. In the long run good or bad the material always wins. So while White Kristen Bell Jamie Lee Curtis Sigourney Weaver Victor Garber Kristin Chenoweth and other reliable actors do their best with You Again they cant do much beyond shining some bright spots on a dull surface. Bell stars as a former teen nerd turned successful PR agent who returns home for her brothers wedding only to find hes marrying the cheerleading bully (Odette Yustman) who tormented her in high school. Yustman claims she doesnt remember Bell but Bell suspects shes hiding her old self behind her good-girl act. Meanwhile Bells mother (Curtis) discovers that Yustmans aunt is her high-school best-friend-turned-enemy (Weaver) now a successful hotelier with the money and airs to match her profession. Broad hijinks ensue all of them pretty dull and not particularly funny. (One involves Bell ending up covered in mud and ant bites.) Theyre seldom actively unpleasant however apart from some nasty subtext about how women who choose careers end up without family and vice versa. Mostly it feels like a between-gigs gig the sort of thing talented actors take to keep working. And while its disappointing that Weaver and Curtis cant find better material and that a talented versatile actress like Bell seems stuck in the purgatory of assembly-line rom-coms maybe everyone here is thinking long-term. Keep working and the highs will balance the lows and with time theyre sure to love you.

Take your daughters and mothers with you to see the Touchstone family comedy about school bullies second chances grudges and growing up. The guys in your life however may be just as befuddled by school-girl politics as the men in the film. Director Andy Fickman who loves to work with longtime friend Kristen Bell casts Bell as the greasy-haired accident-prone forever-in-braces dweeb Marni who is a favorite target of a mean-girl clique in high school. Joanna is the cruel cheerleading leader of Marnis tormentors. Although Marni outgrows the acne ditches the glasses lets her bangs grow out and becomes a successful businesswoman the thought of her nemesis nastiness still makes Marni shudder. Early in the film Marni falls apart when she learns her sweet older brother is engaged to lovely Joanna (Odette Yustman) introduced to Marnis adoring family as an orphaned nurse. Outraged Marni makes it her mission to reveal the real Joanna. Comedy veterans Jamie Lee Curtis and Victor Garber play Marnis parents and Betty White gets some quick laughs as Grandma Bunny. Sigourney Weaver shows up as Joannas rich aunt Ramona who was best friends with Marnis mother in high school until they had a blowup. The wedding weekend throws the women together to make nice or tear each other to bits. Kristin Chenoweth swings through the proceedings as Georgia an extravagant wedding planner. The gosh-darn-cute brother (James Wolk) is a sensitive guy with a best friend who is just right for Marni. The dude with the biggest laughs is Tim (Kyle Bornheimer) Joannas ex. Although not for one minute would you believe Joanna would have been engaged to Tim his lovesick goofiness is part of the fun. Along with the slapstick there are musical numbers and a few surprise cameos. In the end the film leaves you in a dance-happy mood. And perhaps best of all Marni/Bell gets her bangs back. lana.berkowitzchron.com Todays Deals Mini Portable Washer and Spin Dryer for 90 + free shipping Unisex Cushioned Arch Supports for 1 + free shipping Vizio 43"" 4K LED UHD Smart TV 150 Dell GC for 400 + free...

TWITTER Actors shouldnt have to work as hard as they do in ""You Again."" This wedding comedy from Touchstone Pictures has no inherent laughs so an extremely versatile and talented cast struggles mightily to make something funny that simply isnt. Who knew you could rope Kristen Bell Jamie Lee Curtis Sigourney Weaver and Betty White into a movie this lame? Disney has solid TV ads backing the film so You Again might open this weekend but word-of-mouth certainly will kill it. Moe Jellines screenplay in a sense combines two comedy subgenres -- wedding and high school reunion movies -- the theory being that such gatherings bring out the worst in people. Jelline imagines that a bright young PR exec (Bell) flies home for the wedding of her brother (James Wolk star of Foxs tenuous Lone Star series) only to realize the bride was her worst enemy (Odette Yustman) in high school. Doubling down on this dubious premise -- how could her brother who went to the same school not know this? -- Jelline sets up high school ""issues"" between the down-home mother of the groom (Curtis) and the brides pretentious jet-set aunt (Weaver). If youre guessing everyone reverts to form and its high school all over again youve got it. In fact you need to do very little guessing as everything in the script is wholly predictable right down to those cat fights toward the end that pitch this movie to the lowest common denominator. Director Andy Fickman whose most recent film ""Race to Witch Mountain"" showed competency flounders here with strained acting and bad slapstick marring most scenes. You sense Fickman never got a handle on either the tone or approach to this iffy material. In every instance all situations and characterizations are overdone. When a wedding planner drops from a ceiling to perform a theme dance a characters remark that this is too over the top sums up the movie. No one emerges from this with anything youd want to put on a filmography though Betty White does manage to have the movies only amusing line. Then her high school enemy shows up.

Mark Fellman In this publicity image released by Disney Jamie Lee Curtis (left) and Sigourney Weaver are shown in a scene from ""You Again."" (AP Photo/Disney Mark Fellman) One basis for bad comedies is a plot device Ill call the blocked-pipes syndrome when something important goes unspoken until it messily leaks out at the worst possible moment. Examples would be newlywed characters who forget to mention that theyre married. Or gay. Or aliens. In the constipated comedy ""You Again"" a bullied young womans reluctance to confront an old enemy produces some flatulent laughs but by the time the movie lets loose its built up such a toxic aura that its hard to embrace.Its inexact casting for Kristen Bell to play a teenage ugly duckling named Marni Olsen and its lazy writing to have Marni relentlessly ridiculed by cheerleader Joanna (Odette Yustman) for no good reason. Eight years later Marni is an attractive successful public-relations executive; but when she learns that her brother Will (Jimmy Wolk) is going to marry Joanna the old insecurities resurface like zits. Yet back for the wedding in their hometown gracious Joanna claims that she doesnt remember Marni. Worse shes warmly accepted by Marnis mother father and grandmother (Jamie Lee Curtis Victor Garber and Betty White). The prenuptial lovefest is disrupted with the arrival of Joannas closest kin her aunt Ramona (Sigourney Weaver) -- who just happens to have been the high school nemesis of Marnis mother. Timidity must run in the Olsen family because both Marni and her mom let the old wounds fester until the wedding rehearsal when they boil over in slapstick showdowns. After so much passive-aggressive preamble the hair-pulling and plate throwing is almost a relief yet this PG-rated comedy never leverages the full strength of its stars. Weaver is a natural as the imperious Ramona but the rest of the cast is flattened by the script particularly White who is just window-dressing in a movie that could use the rude humor shes displayed elsewhere. Only an unrated directors cut featuring the granny-versus-granny smackdown thats teased in the final scene could make us do ""You Again"" again. Showtimes for You Again Sep 24 2010 (...)

You Again A toast to the drunken wedding guest | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesYou Again A toast to the drunken wedding guestYou Again is burdened by a laugh-free script shot through with a nasty streak.By Greg QuillBooks ColumnistThu. Sept. 23 2010 You Again (out of 4) Starring Kristen Bell Jamie Lee Curtis Sigourney Weaver Odette Yustman Victor Garber. Directed by Andy Fickman. 105 minutes. At major theatres. 14A With a promising setup a bankable cast the new Disney family flick You Again might have been a decent lightweight romantic comedy as its promotional bumph and trailers have lead us to believe. No such luck. A laugh-free script thats underscored by a nasty mean streak -- about revenge and retribution for long-ago high school sins committed by a fetching bully (Odette Yustman) on a hapless geek (Kristen Bell) who has morphed into a beautiful and successful public relations executive -- makes it almost impossible for anyone to get a footing let alone inspire a cackle. Traumatic though high school is for many teenagers it seems the heroine in this mess Marni (Bell) hasnt been able to ditch the painful baggage despite her fresh-faced beauty and rising fortunes in L.A. When she is summoned home for her brothers wedding and learns too late that his bride-to-be is her high-school nemesis the raven-headed vixen cheerleader J.J. (Yustman) she is determined to extract an apology for past crimes only to be thwarted by J.J.s apparent cunning. In Marnis absence J.J. has won the hearts of her parents overplayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Victor Garber and her grandmother rendered humourlessly by a bewildered Betty White. As wedding plans wind up J.J.s position is reinforced by the sudden arrival of her aunt and surrogate mother (Sigourney Weaver) a hotel-chain mogul who it turns out has never overcome high school pain inflicted by her one-time best friend Marnis mother. The script by Moe Jelline piles on psychic sores and insufferable coincidences one after another and in an effort to reach some kind of resolution -- among the platitudinous verbiage that passes for dialogue we get lots of nonsense advice about mistakes humans make and how to fix them. Director Andy Fickman (Race To Witch Mountain) drags his characters through a sideshow of desperate devices including a tedious karaoke event a dish-hurling cat fight a hideously overdone dance instruction routine a full-dress tussle in a pool and two or three surprise cameo appearances. None of its funny. In fact the only performance worth its screen time is what comes off as a bit of improv by Kyle Bornheimer playing J.J.s jilted ex whom Marni has invited to the wedding rehearsal to spite her rival. His drunken musical toast stands out as You Agains one genuinely original bit of business.

Comments You Again Rated PG  105 minutes  2010 Bitchy cheerleaders and swimming pool catfights are just two of the tedious cliches propping up this brittle comedy about the undying hatred between former high school classmates. Kristen Bell (Couples Retreat) stars as the mousey victim of the most popular girl on campus (Odette Yustman); now a glamorous PR executive Bell cant believe her brother is about to marry her old nemesis. Adding to the friction is the brides hypercompetitive aunt (Sigourney Weaver) the long-estranged best friend of Bells mom (Jamie Lee Curtis).

"Movie review You Again - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review You AgainSigourney Weaver and Jamie Lee Curtis bring their talent to situations that exist only in movies such as this. Kristen Bell is pulled into the fray.September 24 2010|By Glenn Whipp Special to the Los Angeles Times To consider the baffling would-be romantic- comedy ""You Again"" its best to use the words of one of the movies male characters who sputters at one point ""I dont pretend to have the slightest clue about the way it works in the girl world. Quite frankly it frightens and confuses me."" That this line was penned by a woman first-time screenwriter Moe Jelline adds a certain level of irony of course. You figure that most women a and men too if theyre older than say 15 a know a thing or two about the girl world. Whats actually impenetrable? The girl world found in crass comedies such as ""You Again"" movies that reduce women to sad clichA(c)s and a uniform level of bad behavior that would appall the cast members of ""Jersey Shore."" The films premise has a kernel of promise High-school nerd Marni ( Kristen Bell) grows up loses the glasses and zits gains a sweet job and competent hairstyle and puts the past behind her. Then she finds out her brother (James Wolk) is marrying Joanna ( Odette Yustman) a.k.a. ""Satans Spawn"" a.k.a. ""the girl who ruined her life in high school."" And in the Small World Department it turns out that Joannas beloved Aunt Ramona ( Sigourney Weaver) enjoyed a high-school rivalry with none other than Marnis mother ( Jamie Lee Curtis) creating a parallel track for two generations of women to play out petty grudges and pratfall their way through the mud and muck to the inevitable group hug. Director Andy Fickman ( ""Race to Witch Mountain"") emphasizes the physical comedy employing an aggressively upbeat score that functions as a wink-wink laugh track. He does try to keep the audience guessing about Joannas nature although that may have more to do with indecision and incompetence than the desire to preserve a sense of mystery. Not surprisingly Weaver and Curtis completely upstage their younger counterparts both women gamely trying to add a bit of dimension and believability to their characters insecurities. Betty White turns up in a small role but of the supporting players its Kyle Bornheimer playing Joannas jilted ex who makes the best impression. His delivery of a rehearsal dinner toast that references Air Supply ranks as one of the most awkward (and funny) movie moments of the year. Maybe this guy could shed some light on the girl world. calendarlatimes.com ?

The film is based on the premise that you can graduate high school but you never leave.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted September 24 2010Theres a word for the kind of female-driven movie that men dont want to see for fear their manhood might shrivel. We wont mention it here. But we will say that You Again is the kind of female-driven drivel that women dont want to see for fear their womanhood might atrophy.Starring the likable Kristen Bell Jamie Lee Curtis Sigourney Weaver and Betty White You Again is an unlikable and excruciatingly unfunny comedy based on the premise that you can graduate high school but you never leave.Once a cafeteria untouchable and now a successful professional in her late 20s Marni (Bell) is stung yet again by Joanna (Odette Yustman) the queen bee who tyrannized her at Ridgefield High. Joanna you see is about to become Marnis sister-in-law.First Joanna pretends not to remember Marni. Then the interloper proceeds to usurp her position with the family dog and grandmother (reliable Betty White). Although PR exec Marni teaches her assistants that public relations is the art of not reacting to provocation privately she is easily provoked. Merely the sight of Joanna makes the confident Marni tremble with insecurity.Maybe its genetic. Because Marnis mother (Curtis) and Joannas aunt (Weaver) turn out to be former high school antagonists who regress to lethal competitiveness when they see each other for the first time in 35 years.The film is an extended series of catfights with Marni and Joanna as the main event and Marnis mother and Joannas aunt as the undercard. While it has a belated third-act plea for conflict resolution it comes too late.Ordinarily I would shrug off the film from Andy Fickman (director of the charming Shes the Man) as a product of Hollywood sexism. However the script comes from female screenwriter Moe Jelline who may be the only person left in America who thinks its funny when female characters fall on their faces for no other reason than to make them less threatening to males in the audience. What men are going to see this movie marketed for women only?Like Bride Wars the contrived You Again purveys conflict in order to spin it into a ""growing experience."" The dominator is humiliated into humility and the doormat stands up for herself by wiping her feet on others. What a waste of talented actresses.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Years later Marni is shocked to discover that Joanna is marrying Marnis brother Will (James Wolk). Everyone loves Joanna including the mother of the groom Gail (Jamie Lee Curtis) who tells Marni that the past is the past. But no sooner does she finish that line than the doorbell rings and in walks Joannas Aunt Mona (Sigourney Weaver) Gails former best frenemy from the same high-school that Marni and Joanna attended.This is another miserable movie about women at war over nonsense.The inexplicable handheld camerawork gives you that ""Saw IV feeling. But lest we think ""You Again is a horror film theres a ubiquitous sickeningly sweet score; its like toilet paper on the shoe of every scene. The entire cast has been encouraged to shout or pop their eyes or kick really high. Were in the presence of former cheerleaders. Accordingly the director Andy Fickmans instruction to his cast appears to have been ""Pretend youre at the Fiesta BowlHighlights of the movies wedding weekend include a dance fight a plate fight and a pool fight. When one set of enemies manages to bury the hatchet its with each woman slumped in front of an open refrigerator. Mascara stains the face. Cheese is sprayed onto an Oreo cookie. (Thats two apt metaphors for this movie.) At some point the word ""culinary is pronounced ""killonary and the opening jags of Hearts ""Barracuda are misapprehended for the purposes of conjuring cattiness.There can be amusement in junk about women who set out to conquer each other over past humiliations often if not quite always regarding a man ""The First Wives Club ""Death Becomes Her ""Drop Dead Gorgeous ""Notes on a Scandal. ""You Again like last years ""Bride Wars is an especially atrocious exception. The movie doesnt hate women as much as it hates comedy. Fickman and the screenwriter Moe Jelline were never going for realism. But what precisely were they going for? Its hard to think of a network that would pick up a half-hour version of this. Only by accident do the filmmakers wind up with farce. Theres really nowhere else for a badly made movie to go.The pratfalls -- jogging into an ant hill crashing off a trampoline getting drenched by the pipes of a bathroom sink -- are mindless. Until the final scene Betty White as grandma has nothing much to do except hand Bell a set of dentures. Kristin Chenoweth meanwhile as the wedding planner descends from the ceiling and tries to steal a few scenes with her naughty-fairy shtick -- she does know she cant win a Tony for this right?At every point the characters have to turn a blind eye to reality or propriety. Gail drops by Monas hotel room and accidentally destroys her dress. Why doesnt Mona whos on an upsetting phone call at the time later ask Gail what happened to her dress and why her bathroom is all wet? This is the sort of movie where instead Mona pulls her convertible alongside Gails car on the street makes snide faces and baits her rival into a drag race.The cast isnt terrible; theyre simply failed by the filmmaking. Kyle Bornheimer who plays Joannas crazy ex is a good unlucky television actor. He appears to be using his handful of scenes here as an audition for a new show. Wolk luckily has one Foxs ""Lone Star which just started this week. Bell possesses smart comic instincts -- her generically pretty face has surprising range. But she needs a director she can trust (it isnt Andy Fickman).Meanwhile Weaver and Curtis project their usual intelligence which adds a tinge of embarrassment to their stabs at professionalism. To her credit Weavers the one actor who arrived on the set with anything resembling a strategy. She plays her part -- a fabulously successful businesswoman with a disastrous personal life -- as a snaky underminer. ""I like your look she hisses to Curtis. ""Its so American. Weavers the one person who manages to emerge from this bomb with only a little soot on her face.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

"You Again (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review You Again (PG) Laughs give way to melodramatic tears. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald9/22/2010 Editor rating 2 Boys who bully other kids may cause bumps and bruises but You Again argues that girls are the meanest of all inflicting psychological scars that take a lifetime to heal. When the hotshot publicist Marni (Kristen Bell) returns home to attend her older brothers wedding shes horrified to discover that his fiance is Joanna (Odette Yustman) the tall beautiful cheerleader who made life hell for her in high school - and conveniently seems to have forgotten the constant torture and humiliation she inflicted on Marni as a teenager. Meanwhile Marnis mom Gail (Jamie Lee Curtis) is like the rest of the family infatuated with her sweet loving soon-to-be daughter-in-law until she meets Joannas sole relative - phenomenally wealthy Aunt Ramona (an amusingly pompous Sigourney Weaver) who embarrassed Gail in spectacular fashion at their high-school prom. Like her niece Ramona seems not to remember the incident and with the wedding only a couple of days away mother and daughter decide to swallow their pride and play nice as if nothing had ever happened. But old grudges die hard - especially those borne in high school. You Again has a clever central premise and it has been cast well by director Andy Fickman Pitting soccer mom Curtis against the jet-setting Weaver leads to an amusing passive-aggressive war in which the combatants are all kisses and hugs on the outside but coiled and ready to strike on the inside. Bell a likable screen presence is good at conveying Marnis absolute horror at the prospect of her former arch enemy having wormed her way into the family and charming everyone (even the dog now prefers Joanna). You Again is at its funniest in the early scenes when everyone is pretending all is well beneath forced smiles and plotting eyes. A dance-off at a rehearsal led by a wedding planner extraordinaire (Kristin Chenoweth) is an amusing bit of physical comedy with the four women trying to out-do each other while the men have no idea of the battle of one-upmanship being waged in front of them. But once the gloves come off and the claws come out - just when the film should erupt into full-blown farce - the script by Moe Jelline takes a melodramatic turn and You Again loses the funny in favor of sentimentality and tears. Fickman directs the movie in the same bland assembly-line style of his previous pictures (The Game Plan Return to Witch Mountain) and although the humor is never fully abandoned watching Curtis and Weaver falling into a swimming pool and splashing water at each other doesnt exactly make for high comedy. The cast also includes Betty White in a small role as Marnis grandmother but her presence feels like an afterthought to capitalize on the actress career resurgence after last summers hit The Proposal. She like the rest of the women often behaves in inscrutable ways contrived to propel the plot forward. This is the sort of story that relies from its outset on the fact that people have decided not to tell the truth that would have saved everyone a lot of grief and distress. ""I dont pretend to have a clue how things work in the girl world laments Mark (Victor Garber) after seeing how his wife and daughter have apparently lost their marbles over ancient rivalries. Here is one case in which father definitely knows best. Cast Kristen Bell Jamie Lee Curtis Sigourney Weaver Odette Yustman Victor Garber James Wolk Kristin Chenoweth Betty White.

You Again Fair Director Andy Fickman. Cast Kristen Bell Jamie Lee Curtis Sigourney Weaver. Rating PG for brief mild language and rude behavior. Qamp;A Kristen Bell | Sigourney Weaver Movies about weddings Its a game effort if not an entirely successful one. Kristen Bell plays Marni the classic zit-faced high-school loser who has grown up to be a successful public-relations executive (and naturally beautiful to boot). After learning of a big promotion she heads home for her brothers wedding - only to find that he is marrying Joanna (Odette Yustman) who spent high school as a beautiful popular cheerleader and as something of a sidelight tormenting Marni. To make matters worse Joanna now claims to have no recollection of the bad old days and has turned into a saintly humanitarian sort. Marni suspects the worst of course an elaborate ruse that has somehow managed to fool her family. Nonsense insists Marnis mother Gail (Jamie Lee Curtis). Until at least the arrival of Joannas fabulously wealthy and successful Aunt Ramona (Sigourney Weaver). It turns out she and Gail were friends-turned-fierce rivals in high school. Small world no? What follows are slapstick-heavy attempts by Marni to make her brother (James Wolk) see the error of his ways and Gail to prove that she is still despite Ramonas money and station at least her equal if not her better bank accounts notwithstanding (though from the looks of their home Gails doing just fine too). There are no great surprises but along the way we do get to enjoy Victor Garber as the slightly off-kilter Mark Marnis father and as close to a voice of reason as the movie offers; Kristin Chenoweth as a loopy celebrity wedding planner; and the ubiquitous Betty White as Grandma Bunny the same sort of character she has made a mint playing in this stage of her career. Some of Marnis efforts are remarkably mean-spirited but Bell is such an ingratiating personality that theyre mostly forgiven (by the audience if not all the characters). Curtis and Weaver have a nice chemistry together; its easy to believe they once might have been friends. There are no surprises here just a by-the-numbers comedy thats better and funnier than it has a right to be thanks to the efforts of the actors in it. If thats damning with faint praise well look on the bright side. Its better than just damning.
