Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Mel Brooks 1968 movie classic The Producers became a Broadway smash. Now comes a new big-screen version that preserves the originals humor and adds the stage shows musical elements. DEBBIE ELLIOTT host ""The Producers"" by Mel Brooks has traveled an unusual road--from movie to musical to movie musical. There have been cast changes script changes and form changes but Bob Mondello says one thing has remained constant Its funny. BOB MONDELLO reporting Very broad very boisterous very 1950s which is odd since the original was set in 1968 ""The Producers"" is as always the tale of con man Max Bialystock and his timid accountant Leo Bloom who schemed to make more money with a Broadway flop than they ever could with a hit starts to seem plausible when they come across the perfect script. (Soundbite of ""The Producers"") Mr. NATHAN LANE (As Max Bialystock) A disaster a guaranteed-to-close-in-one-night beauty Mr. MATTHEW BRODERICK (As Leo Bloom) Lets see it. Mr. NATHAN LANE (As Max Bialystock) Yes. Mr. BRODERICK (As Leo Bloom) ""Springtime for Hitler"" a gay romp with Eva and Adolf at Bertesgarten. Oh my God. MONDELLO Script in hand they go searching for a director who can do justice to this material and find Roger De Bris who expresses in song what they think is the perfect approach. (Soundbite of ""The Producers"") Mr. GARY BEACH (As Roger De Bris singing) I see a line of beautiful girls dressed as storm troopers each one a gem with leather boots and whips on their hips. Its risque dare I say Samp;M... MONDELLO As with everything in ""The Producers"" this number goes over the top pretty quickly. Gary Beach like the leads Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick created the part on Broadway where the trick is projecting to the back row. Susan Stroman who directed them there hasnt urged anyone to tone things down just because theyre now in 40-foot close-ups. A first-time filmmaker she takes her cues from those big Technicolor musicals Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly made back in the 1950s everything bright and show-bizzy just like the songs Mel Brooks wrote to expand his movie for Broadway. Everything gets expanded here again so where on stage Nathan Lane led a dozen of his little old lady benefactors in a tap dance with their walkers now hes leading maybe a hundred. And the vintage jokes are equally broad as in this exchange between the leads and Ulla their sexy Swedish receptionist played on screen by Uma Thurman. (Soundbite of ""The Producers"") Mr. LANE (As Bialystock) What time can you be here in the morning? Ms. UMA THURMAN (As Ulla) Vell Ulla wake up every morning 5 AM. From 5 to 7 Ulla like to exercise. From 7 to 8 Ulla like to take long shower. From 8 to 9 Ulla like to have big Swedish breakfast many different (unintelligible). From 9 to 11 Ulla like to practice her singing and her dancing and at 11 Ulla like to have sex. Vat time should I get here? Mr. LANE (As Bialystock) and Mr. BRODERICK (As Bloom) (In unison) 11. MONDELLO Saw that coming did you? Well thats sort of the point. This may be the only musical comedy in which the jokes take at least as much brass to deliver as the songs which is not to suggest that the musical numbers arent fun only that the music doesnt trump the laughs the way it often does on stage. Happily the central joke is as tasteless and as funny as ever. Im Bob Mondello. (Soundbite of ""The Producers"") Mr. BEACH (As De Bris singing) Its ""Springtime for Hitler"" and Germany...

Time has softened such notoriety leaving us a comedy classic - graced by irreplaceable turns from shyster Zero Mostel Gene Wilders meek accountant and nutty playwright Kenneth Mars - latterly cannily redrafted by Brooks into a wildly successful Broadway musical thanks to a retuned plot and added production numbers.Now we get the film of the show of the film except its not really much of a movie more like a recording of the stage version. Theatre director Susan Stroman clearly has little idea how to shape comedy and music for the screen so she just plonks the camera down and lets the show roll on allowing the Broadway cast of flamboyant impresario Nathan Lane and ambitious bean-counter Matthew Broderick to play it to the back of the gallery. On celluloid this proves brashly overstated yet somehow lifeless while the energetic efforts of Will Ferrells Nazi-loving writer and a howlingly miscast Uma Thurman as sexy Swedish secretary Ulla also struggle to raise the spirits. True the brightly artificial production values recall the widescreen extravaganzas of the 50s but dismayingly little thought has been given to reinventing the material for todays cinema stylings. Of course the gags are indestructible to a degree and Springtime For Hitler remains a kitsch show-stopper but this is extraneous for anyone whos seen the original film or show presumably leaving everyone else to wonder what all the fuss has been about.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Producers"" with Nathan Lane Matthew Broderick Uma Thurman Will Ferrell Gary Beach Roger Bart Eileen Essel. Directed by Susan Stroman from a screenplay by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan. 132 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual humor and references. Several theaters. If ever a movie should open under the banner of Only If You Like This Sort of Thing its ""The Producers"" an unabashedly old-fashioned musical filled with song dance and shtick so shticky you could hang wallpaper with it. Theres nothing remotely up-to-date or innovative about this glitzy film version of the Broadway musical written by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan and directed by Susan Stroman. But in its slap-happy way it creates giddy giggly fun -- not quite as much fun as watching the stage show but an enjoyable evening at the movies. This version of ""The Producers"" has a tangled pedigree -- its a movie made from a stage musical made from a movie. Brooks 1968 comedy starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder was cheerfully tasteless (and very funny) Broadway satire Max Bialystock a low-rent Broadway producer and accountant Leo Bloom team up to make money by mounting the worst show of all time. (Creative accounting apparently means that flops can make more money than hits.) ""Springtime for Hitler"" written by a Nazi lunatic and staged with goose-stepping chorus girls looks to be that flop -- except it isnt. In 2001 Brooks teamed up with choreographer Stroman to transform ""The Producers"" into a hit stage musical starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. Now its back on the screen with songs in tow and much of the Broadway cast with a few movie stars along for the ride Will Ferrell plays nutcase playwright Franz Liebkind; Uma Thurman is Ulla the Swedish bombshell receptionist. And considering Stromans obvious inexperience with film it works far better than it has a right to. Much of this material is so funny that all you have to do is point a camera in the vague direction of it -- which all too often is exactly what Stroman does. The musical numbers are predictably but amusingly blown out the vast lines of little old ladies with walkers in ""Along Came Bialy"" (which rhymes handily with ""Whos your daddy?""); the rows of miserable accountants tapping a percussive beat on their adding machines in ""I Wanna Be a Producer."" Everything in this movie is bigger than it needs to be to comic effect -- particularly the lead performances. Lane his face glowing hammily pink bellows his way through the role of Bialystock with surprising touches of subtlety. (Just brief touches mind you.) Broderick pale and nebbishy lends his trademark trembling voice to Bloom a milquetoast who blooms (sorry) at the idea of becoming a somebody He wants to be a producer in the lyrics of his song "" cause its everything Im not."" Ferrell who can be thoroughly annoying in large doses is very effective in his Lederhosen; spitting out his songs with an ever-wandering German accent and obvious glee. Thurman a knockout in her clingy costumes likewise seems to be enjoying sending up her sexpot persona. Among the supporting players Roger Bart (the scary pharmacist George in ""Desperate Housewives"") stands out. As Carmen Ghia common-law assistant to director Roger De Bris (Gary Beach) he does a sprightly leap into the air as he hurries to answer a door -- then fleetingly holds a hand to his lower back. (Sprightliness apparently is a tricky business.) Thats the kind of humor youll get with ""The Producers"" over-the-top and loaded with broader-than-Broadway stereotypes. (Watch closely for some random throwaway gags I was amused to see on the doorbells to the building where the wealthy little old ladies live the name of ""E. Wharton."") And as a film intended to capture the magic of its stage stars it falls a bit short Lane and Brodericks performances dont leap off the screen as say Barbra Streisand does in ""Funny Girl."" If musicals arent your cup of tea stay away -- ""The Producers"" is strictly for those who are dazzled by a row of tap-dancing convicts or tickled to recognize trademark Fred-and-Ginger steps in a romantic dance for two. Stromans film seems unlikely to help the movie-musical genre rise from the dead ""Chicago"" remains alone in that regard. But for sheer silly entertainment there are far worse options than spending two hours with this crowd. And if you dont like one gag wait for the next one -- it wont be long in coming.

Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killing - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sentence Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killingJuly 10 2009|By Sarah Lundy and Amy L. Edwards Sentinel Staff WritersA judge sentenced a 22-year-old Orange County man to life in prison without parole Thursday in a 2006 fatal shooting during a drug deal gone wrong.Deangelo Conner was convicted last month of first-degree murder armed robbery and two counts of robbery with a firearm.Florida law required Circuit Judge Bob Wattles to sentence Conner to life in prison for the murder conviction.Conner had turned down a 25-year plea offer and took his chances at trial.His first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors were heard discussing the case before it was allowed.Authorities say Conner shot Ricardo Rivera 41 once in the chest July 6 2006.Conner and two others initially set up the meeting as a drug buy but they never intended to pay for anything the prosecution said; the three planned to grab the drugs and run.At one point Conner pulled out a gun and fired at Rivera. Conner told investigators that Rivera was charging toward him and he was merely protecting himself.The jury didnt buy it.Several of Ricardo Riveras relatives attended the sentencing including his children and brother Robert Rivera who read statements from several people.In a statement Ricardo Riveras ex-wife wrote that the hardest thing she has had to do was tell her children they no longer had a father.The woman wrote that her familys hurt will never go away.

I like that its broad -- everything about it from its acting to its humor to its accents all of it as broad as the Great White Way from which it sprang. I like that its tasteless -- way beyond offensively tasteless sending up Swedes and horny old ladies and accountants and Village People and swastika-wearing Nazis in lederhosen. I like that a guy playing Hitler sings Heil Myself. I like that its stagey and old-fashioned. I like that the dance sequences are actually danced not sliced-and-diced into a bajillion little edits to cover up the fact that no ones really hoofing all that well. I like that it isnt Chicago. I like that Richard Gere doesnt tap. I like that Matthew Broderick wears a top hat in a Busby Berkelian bit with buxom beauties. I like that Nathan Lane wears his hair in a greasy homage to Zero Mostels comb-over from the 1968 original -- always my favorite Mel Brooks movie. I like that Broderick pays tribute to Gene Wilder but stops short of outright aping him. I like that he and Lane at different times seem to have lost their marbles. All of them. I like that the whole film is insane that the cast seems to have inhaled helium and suffered some hereditary metabolism disorder that makes them run around at double speed mugging for close-ups. I like that no one in their right mind should have made this movie. I like that its overacted; I like that no restraint is evident anywhere; I even like that its flawed. I like the plot. I like Lanes Max Bialystock and Brodericks Leo Bloom failed producer and mousy accountant who decide to fleece old women in their quest to mount the worst Broadway show of all time. I like the spangly Aryan musical they produce Springtime for Hitler and its nutcracked Nazi playwright Franz Liebkind. I like Will Ferrell who plays him (replacing Brad Oscar beloved in the stage play) with his distinctive demented half-grown dottiness but comes across -- Im not sure why -- as sweet. I like Gary Beach and Roger Bart as Springtimes cross-dressing director and his grand-jete-ing partner and I like how joyously out they are (though I squirm at the stereotypes in their entourage of houseboys). I like the insouciant vintage melodies of Mel Brooks songs and I like how everyone belts em out. I like seeing Lane and Broderick doing their shtick. I like that theyve been preserved on celluloid by Susan Stroman the woman who brought the Broadway show to life though her handling of the camera looks blockish and awkward in spots. Im not sure I like Uma Thurman who replaced Cady Huffman as Ulla the Swedish sexcretary but I dont much mind her either and her scenes with Broderick have a certain slinky flare. I like the credits. I like that I sat straight through and caught a few surprises at the end. I like that I laughed nonstop or close to it pausing only to wince or groan at trademark Brooksian vulgarities. I like that no one seems to care at all what idiots they look like. I like that after all these years Mel Brooks is still Mel Brooks not some etiquette-conscious tipsy-toed politically corrected stand-in. Thats what I like most about The Producers Its a kitschy celebration of all things Mel. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Bass Pro Shops Clearance Sale Deals from 1 + free shipping w/...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The first incarnation of ""The Producers"" Mel Brooks contrarian comedy that made mad sport of Jews Nazis and gays (for starters) hit the screen in 1968. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder starred as a has-been theater producer and his accountant partner who realize a flop has better earning potential than a hit. The second incarnation of Brooks comedy teased the same themes. Only it did it with more song more dance and on the very stage it was spoofing Broadway. A not-so-funny thing has happened to ""The Producers"" on its way back to the screen Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick - the two guys who wowed em on Broadway and reprise their roles as Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom - have been upstaged by nearly everyone else in this movie musical. (The lone exception Uma Thurman as their very tall very blond secretary Ulla.) While this is great news for holiday hams Will Ferrell Gary Beach and Roger Bart (who play a Nazi playwright a flamboyant director and his even more over-the-top assistant respectively) it doesnt bode well for the film. After all Max and Leo arent just producing what they hope will be a tremendous flop. They should be carrying this picture. Presumably no ones banking on this movie to dive. Lane and Broderick have no one to blame but themselves - and maybe director Susan Stroman. The trio cling hard to the tricks that made their ""The Producers"" such a success on stage. There are no rafters in film. Broderick who has done some fine-tuned work onscreen should know this. Yet in the movies overlong beginning his pent-up accountant is a portrait of stagy tics. Brodericks dial seems stuck. Lanes Max is nearly as garish. A desperate showman hes supposed to play it big. But Lanes performance has been crafted for the visually deaf. ""The Producers"" does offer laugh-out-loud pleasures. The first comes when accountant Bloom returns to his office. Max may have tempted Leo with the possibility of living his dream but its Leos snarky boss (Jon Lovitz) who shoves him over the edge and into a tune. Max discovers their opening-night disaster when he reads Franz Liebkinds musical. Will Ferrell sings He dances Darned if he doesnt charm as the Nazi fool who has penned ""Springtime for Hitler."" Then Max lands their director the woefully untalented occasionally cross-dressing Roger De Bris (Beach) and his assistant Carmen Ghia (Bart). Evidently it takes the Village People to make a De Bris production. Over time ""The Producers"" finds an amusing goofball rhythm. Its no ugly-duckling- to-swan transformation. But it is a much-needed shift from an awkwardly filmed play into something akin to one of Busby Berkeleys old-time spectaculars. It may not be great but it is a movie.

"The Producers Kitsch as Kitsch Can washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies The Producers Kitsch as Kitsch Can Nathan Lane Uma Thurman and Matthew Broderick in the movie of the musical of the movie about putting on a musical ""The Producers."" (Universal Pictures Via Reuters) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday December 24 2005 The question re ""The Producers"" would not be ""Is it any good?"" but ""How good is it?"" Its got to be good How could it not be good? Or even great. Its ""The Producers"" after all. The original from 1968 may be the funniest movie ever made. It combined brilliance of many different kinds -- of premise of performance (Zero Mostel Gene Wilder) of audacity (""Springtime for Hitler"") of sentimentality (for old Broadway which New Yorker Mel Brooks clearly loved) of satire of outrageousness. It entered film history at the cult level and launched Brooks on one of the most inspiring careers in comedy. Then years later along came ""The Producers"" to Broadway now musicalized where in 2001 it set a record by winning 12 Tonys including best musical best book (Brooks and Thomas Meehan) best actor (Nathan Lane) best featured actor and actress (Gary Beach and Cady Huffman) and best choreographer and director (Susan Stroman). So how good is the movie of the musical of the movie? The answer is Its pretty good. Its too long to be great and its too square to be great and its too loud to be great and it finds homosexual effeminacy too funny to ever be called great but I cant imagine anyone coming out sadder than they went in other than the few remaining Nazis who will remember after all that the Fhrer was a great dancer and feel that aspect of his personality has been slighted. An ideal world -- that is a world run by me in contravention to all laws of physics and biology -- would mandate an ideal ""Producers"" starring Nathan Lane and Gene Wilder. Alas back here in the real world Stromans film stars her legit boards boys Lane and Matthew Broderick Mostel having gone on to that great delicatessen in the sky and Wilder pretty much retired. Its not that Broderick is bad or even disappointing; hes something far worse -- hes not Gene Wilder. He doesnt have Wilders God-given gift for suggesting a hysteria more intense than a seizure which it resembles and which twists his rhythms into giddy pulse-crazed gibberish sited on the outer reaches of human irrationality. He goes hysterical the way bullets go ballistic -- at hyper speed and damn the consequences -- then returns in a flash crisis solved to sweet-natured blue-eyed docility. Broderick is just Matthew Broderick hardworking decent possibly charisma-challenged. When he goes hysterical its just an actor doing a fair hysteria not a man touched by the deity speaking in tongues. But I know some of you are Zeros people. Zero had the most astonishing comb-over in captivity and that dainty fat-guy fussiness. He seemed to possess a size 54 waist while wearing size 5 shoes and was astonishingly light on his feet like a 600-pound Tinker Bell. His eyes narrowed into psychotic greed with extreme passion and his fat fingers seemed hungry to rip more more more flesh off the carcass. It was great I give you that and its just taste that you favor Zero and I favor Nathan. The case for Lane rests on those really cool aigu-et-grave- accent eyebrows going for him which means that everything he says is deeply insincere. I treasure that in a man. He makes lies sound like lies and the truth sound like even worse lies. Hes a belter too. He seems to be channeling Ethel Merman and when he power-blasts a number you can practically feel the spit-spray through the screen. As those of you not from Mars or Alpha Centauri or Middle Earth already know the premise of ""The Producers"" is brilliant in its simplicity A longtime producer Max Bialystock (Lane) and a naive accountant Leo Bloom (Broderick) realize that its possible to make more money on a flop than on a hit by oversubscribing investments. Thus they work crazily to put on the worst show in Broadway history coming up with a paean to the Third Reich called ""Springtime for Hitler"" complete with a singing Hitler and kitsch moments including a chorus line that mutates into a swastika-formation a la an Obergruppenfuhrer-SS Busby Berkeley or Leni Riefenstahl on animal tranquilizers. Of course they fail completely by succeeding wildly. A hit a hit a palpable hit Stromans film version is extremely enjoyable if somewhat square in its presentation. Brooks remains the producer and therefore one suspects in power to preserve his original. In any event Stroman doesnt try to break new ground on the eternal dilemma of how to blow out a contained stage show for the more penetrative and flexible medium of film Rather than find a new place to stage it she settles for the unexceptional -- a reasonably naturalistic world with heavy stylizations that subtly transforms itself to even more stylized stage space for the musical numbers. Shes encouraged Lane and Broderick to stay stage-big; theres no attempt to dial anything down toward the more intimate brand of naturalism that is the house style of commercial cinema. So they blast away (thus the loudness). I think the camera gets too close sometimes and is too honest. It reveals that Lane is a born hoofer (different from being a great dancer) and that his natural element is the stage; he moves with gusto and relish and seems always as happy as a you-know-what in you-know-what. Broderick is not a born hoofer; he has learned by practice practice practice and somehow the camera senses his tentativeness when he dances as if hes squinching up his eyes in concentration making certain that each step is exactly right and that he is hitting his marks perfectly. ""Thinking is the enemy of perfection"" said Conrad -- who would have made a terrific movie reviewer. None of the numbers struck me as fabulous but all are completely entertaining The famous ""Along Came Bialystock"" puts a chorus line of old ladies with walkers onstage doing spins and whirls to great comic delight. And ""Im So Unhappy"" when Brodericks Leo returns to his accounting firm may touch the heart of anyone whos spent way too much time in the office. ""Springtime for Hitler"" the signature number of the show is more elaborate here than in the original; its still mind-boggling. You can feel Brooks making corrections as he goes along. The least successful character in the long-ago original was Dick Shawns hippy-dippy beatnik-musical Hitler. Now hes been replaced first by Will Ferrell -- who ends up onstage as an expansion of his role as Franz Liebkind the insane author of the book -- and then by Gary Beach playing here as he did onstage the plays gigantically gay director Roger De Bris. Ulla the sexy Swedish receptionist hired by Max has been blown up to give the piece some sexual tension (with Leo) and a genuine star of stature is brought in to play the role Uma Thurman. Uma Matthew. Matthew Uma. Anyhow shes very good but shes a person from film come to theater that is only provisionally a film again and you feel a slight bit of tentativeness in her dancing. The film is 134 minutes long; the last 14 are a killer particularly as Brooks and Stroman shunt through various endings and can never find one that really sums up whats come before. Neither could the original. This ending is just as bad only longer. The Producers at area theaters is rated PG-13 for sexual humor and references.

"Blood from Stones. Slate Sign In Sign Up Blood from Stones. Blood from Stones. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateReel TimeRunning thoughts on movies and their makings.Dec. 16 2005 347 PM Blood From Stones Riches in The Family Stone and  wretchedness in The Producers. By David Edelstein The Family Stone yields a holiday gem The Family Stone (20th Century Fox) directed and written by Thomas Bezucha is a very heavy-handed home-for-the-holidays romantic sitcom with cancer thrown into the mix--which makes it both a would-be crowd-pleaser and a wriggling hunk of Oscar bait. There are cringe-worthy passages and an overly sentimental structure (everyone pairs up so very tidily) but the performances are delightful and the picture comes together. Advertisement The liberal sturdy nurturing Stone parents Kelly (Craig T. Nelson) and Sybil (Diane Keaton) have five children and all things considered theyve turned out handsomely. Everyone signs lovingly in the presence of the deaf son Thad (played by the deaf actor Tyrone Giordano) and the family has nothing but affection for his African-American husband Patrick (Brian J. White). Although forlorn in the absence of her traveling-on-business spouse the very pregnant Susanna (Elizabeth Reaser) has a spunky daughter (Savannah Stehlin) to keep her spirits up. Amy (Rachel McAdams) is a tad sardonic but an attractive presence. Ben is a bit of a rover--but hes played by Luke Wilson so hes sensitive and well Luke Wilson. So wheres the conflict? Its the new girl. Everett (Dermot Mulroney) has arrived with a brittle stuck-up illiberal and overly ambitious fiancee Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker); and despite the familys assurances that they like her very much they dont like her a bit--especially when she wrecks Christmas Eve dinner by suggesting that a gay child (as opposed to a ""normal"" one) might be something that a parent wouldnt wholeheartedly welcome (because you know its such a tough life). Happily an ethereally beautiful alternative to Meredith arrives in the form of Merediths do-gooder sister (Claire Danes never more ravishing). Despite the destabilizing shrew--who is nevertheless endearing in her insecurity--The Family Stone depicts a fundamentally healthy ecosystem. In fact its the most idealized family imaginable. I mean where do I sign up? I dont buy them but theres a part of me that wants to--and thinks a movie like this gives us all something to emulate. The brisk dialogue and the actors who deliver it usher The Family Stone into the realm of real. Sarah Jessica Parker-haters will be awed by the bang-up job she does as the highest of high-strung fiancees that populate these sorts of movies--and her big drunk scene in which her inhibitions explode explodes whatever inhibitions we might have about her. Nelson and Keaton have a gentle and comfortable rapport--unusual for Keaton whos usually the high-strung one in a movie. This is the latest in a long line of stupendous Keaton performances. Her Sybil is an unusual but irresistible combination of warmth and tartness of the determinedly upbeat and the haunted. She is not ""the mother."" Shes a woman with strong maternal feelings who nonetheless has to work at the job--i.e. a real person. At long last--a failure There are no real people in The Producers (Universal)--only actors laboring to dispel whatever magic they once were thought to possess. The director Susan Stroman has brought the Broadway smash to the screen (where it began almost 40 years ago) with cataclysmic results. The stage performances havent been scaled down Everything is pitched to the second balcony. And Mel Brooks material--especially the retro queeny stereotypes--is excruciatingly dated. On stage Nathan Lane gets by on hamminess and good timing but on screen theres no subtext nothing in reserve Hes more one-dimensional than the average cartoon character. Broderick in the footsteps of the peerless Gene Wilder pops his eyes and speaks in a strangled voice thats completely artificial. If this were the only thing Id seen him do Id conclude he was wholly without talent. Uma Thurman sings well and slinks better but the songs are short on melody and the role is a bimbonic disgrace. The only time I laughed was when an actor auditioning for the role of Hitler said ""I was in No No Nietzsche and Lane said ""You were Nietzsche?"" and the actor said ""No no."" Amid the shrillness second-rate vaudeville patter lands on the ear like Shakespeare. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

Somebody should just stop remaking The Producers. The premise was a hoot in 1968 when Mel Brooks had the idea. And the stage musical was a clever spinoff. But did we really need a movie of the play of the original movie? Will Ferrell left Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick star in the movie based on the Broadway musical thats based on the movie. Universal Studios Sure there are movies that are remade three times (King Kong). But the key is putting a new spin on it adapting a classic with state-of-the-art technology or a new perspective. Alas The Producers is just like watching a filmed version of the Broadway production without the immediacy of watching it mounted in a theater. About the movie The Producers   1/2 (out of four) Stars Nathan Lane Matthew Broderick Will Ferrell Uma Thurman Director Susan Stroman Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for sexual humor and references Running time 2 hours 14 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Its not that its a particularly bad movie. It simply doesnt add much to our experiences of seeing the original film or the play. Nathan Lane reprises his stage role of shlocky producer Max Bialystock with just the right over-the-top verve. His enthusiastic efforts verging on apoplectic are quite funny. But Matthew Broderick seems as if he has grown tired of playing the straight man. As Leopold Bloom the nebbishy accountant who dreams of being a Broadway producer Broderick seems to mug his way through the proceedings with the same wide-eyed expression. Bialystock is hemorrhaging money relying on a bevy of little old ladies to pay for his projects. Hes an unlikely Lothario to these randy biddies and their song-and-dance number featuring tap-dancing walkers is a corny hoot. When Bloom comes in to do Bialystocks books he discovers that more money can be made with a theatrical bomb than a hit. He mentions this casually to Bialystock who jumps on the idea and an unlikely partnership is born. Uma Thurman plays the secretary/actress Ulla proving shes a capable singer and dancer. The best moments belong to Will Ferrell playing Hitler-loving Franz Liebkind who has written the worst play Bialystock and Bloom ever read -- with one of the most hilarious titles Brooks ever dreamed up Springtime for Hitler. A lederhosen-wearing dimwit Franz waxes nostalgically about the days of the Third Reich. Ferrell who has a way with accents and bizarre roles makes this freakish fool his own. For Ferrell a talented comic actor who has been overexposed of late the zany turn is refreshing. Hes almost as funny as he was in Zoolander and Anchorman. Even more fun than Lane and Broderick are Gary Beach as the flamingly gay stage director Roger De Bris and Roger Bart as his ""common law"" assistant Carmen Ghia. The movie has some engaging moments. The dance number with Broderick and a roomful of bespectacled accountants that segues into a Busby Berkeley-style extravaganza benefits from being on film. On the flip side the Berkeley-inspired overhead shots are overused as is Central Park as a location. The play may have won a dozen Tonys but dont expect a repeat performance at the Oscars.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Movies Mel Brooks Theater or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- Its impossible to imagine any movie getting as much advance publicity as Mel Brooks ""The Producers."" Anyone who hasnt been living under a rock knows that the original film ""The Producers"" written and directed by Mel Brooks in 1968 moved to Broadway in 2001 as a musical and won a record 12 Tony Awards. You couldnt turn on your TV or read a newspaper without a mention of this phenomenal production.Susan Stroman is making her film debut as a director by returning this movie to the big screen but this time out its based on the Broadway musical she directed with such success.Shot at the new state-of-the-art film facility at the Brooklyn Navy Yard Stroman has stayed so close to her Broadway version she might as well have dragged the proscenium arch along with her across the Brooklyn Bridge.With the exception of a scene in Central Park and a musical number on Fifth Avenue -- along with a close-up here and there -- this production is so stagy it feels like the camera was placed in the middle of the theaters third row and just turned on.This is good or bad depending on how you want to look at it -- a ticket to the Broadway production (which is still running) is around 100 bucks and your average movie ticket is now about 12. What a bargain You could also wait for the DVD which will really be a deal.Im not saying the film isnt funny -- it is -- and if you love Mel Brooks -- and I do (although ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"" not the ""Producers"" are my favorites) -- youll probably enjoy this flick which is pure Brooks from start to finish.The comedy is extremely broad. Every joke is telegraphed so well it would make Western Union proud and every old Borscht Belt drummer is aching to hit a rim shot after every line.Most of the main cast remains in place with Matthew Broderick playing the neurotic accountant Leo Bloom and Nathan Lane back as the desperate Broadway producer (who preys on little old ladies to finance his shows) Max Bialystock. Gary Beach once again dons a sequined gown as the cross-dressing director Roger De Bris and Roger Bart his common-in-law assistant Carmen Ghia prances across the screen right on cue.There are two main additions to the film. Uma Thurman -- a mother of two who has a body most women would kill for -- plays Ulla the bombshell Swedish actress. She lights up the screen when singing ""When Youve Got It Flaunt It."" Will Ferrell is delightful as playwright Franz Liebkind who wrote the musical as an ode to his hero Adolf Hitler.The basic premise for those two or three people out there who dont know is that Bloom -- in an offhand remark -- tells Bialystock that if he produced a play that closed on opening night he could oversell shares to the backers of the production and make millions of dollars when the play tanked. Bialystock talks a reluctant Bloom into being his partner and soon they find the perfect bomb ""Springtime for Hitler.""Sitting in the theater watching this film almost felt like being at one of those late-night screenings of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" where the audience sings along with their favorite songs. I almost found myself belting out a couple of the tunes but thankfully I was able to restrain myself.Broderick and Lane know this material so well they could have phoned it in but to their credit they both give it their all.Brooks and all the other main players in the production decided to make this Broadway musical into a film because they wanted it on film for posterity.They succeeded. Its now on film forever and ever along with their purposely over-the-top performances.Theres just one little problem --- this isnt a movie. Its a Broadway musical captured on film.

Its a classic example of how a movie can be great without strictly speaking being good. But when something is this funny who wants to speak strictly?This same principle applies to the musical movie of ""The Producers"" thats been made from the Broadway show. Susan Stroman who also directed on stage does the honors here which is probably just as well; its been a long time since Brooks has directed a good movie.I had not seen the show that Brooks with his co-writer Thomas Meehan created for Broadway and I was skeptical that the film would be any good at least as a musical. After all despite its record number of Tonys can anybody hum a single song - a single refrain - from the show except for ""Springtime for Hitler""? Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? It turns out that the movie works very well as the kind of grand-scale burlesque that Brooks does so well. The best moments from his movies have often been the musical numbers - think of Peter Boyle and Gene Wilder in ""Young Frankenstein"" doing ""Puttin on the Ritz"" in top hat and tails. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Repeating their parts from Broadway Nathan Lane is in the Mostel role as loudmouth impresario Max Bialystock while Matthew Broderick reprising Wilders strangly-voiced tantrums is the milquetoast accountant Leo Bloom.These two decide they can make more money with a flop than with a hit - hence the musical ""Springtime for Hitler"" the brainchild of one Franz Liebkin played by Will Ferrell in a barking-mad role he was born to play. (This is intended as a compliment.)Lane and Broderick have performed the show so often that at times theyre too polished too slick. Also in the first few scenes they seem to be imitating Mostel and Wilder right down to the mile-wide leers and eye rolls. The leering reaches Olympian proportions when Uma Thurmans curvy Ulla the Swedish secretary waltzes in.But Stroman keeps things lively and Lane in particular comes into his own. He mugs too much for my taste but then again ""The Producers"" isnt exactly subtle. It wouldnt be ""The Producers"" if it were.It is possible of course to take great offense at the very notion of a musical comedy about Hitler. But giving offense - not as a biting satirist but as a slap-happy comic - is Brooks stock in trade. (In ""History of the World Part I"" he staged a musical number about the Inquisition.)For Brooks the Hitler humor in ""The Producers"" is a sign of life Hes saying we survived you didnt.

"Producers The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; producers-the ) Producers The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Producers is a movie based on a play based on a movie about a play. And thats probably the funniest thing about it. In 1968 Mel Brooks made his big-screen directorial and writing debut with The Producers a slapstick farce about how two Broadway producers concoct a scheme to get rich by making the worst play in the history of the Great White Way. Predictably what should be a colossal failure turns out to be a smash hit. Despite a delightfully wicked premise and a couple of delicious lines The Producers is not on par with Brooks other early films. Its not consistently clever or funny and there are long tedious stretches when one obvious joke after another falls flat. Brooks would hit his stride six years later with Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. The Producers shows little of the humor evident in those (and other) movies. Yet perhaps because of the material it became Brooks 1 target to transform into a Broadway musical. The play became a monster hit pilfering a rack of Tonys selling out a year in advance and becoming the darling of critics. A new movie version became inevitable and Brooks got many of the theatrical principals on board including director Susan Stroman and stars Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. The new film is a faithful re-creation of the stage production (which in turn is a showy and amped-up adaptation of the 1968 movie). Sadly that may not be a good thing. The Producers is 128 minutes of diluted mostly-unfunny comedy interrupted by uninspired unmemorable music. Its the kind of thing that can work in front of a live audience but often falls apart on the big screen. It wasnt that long ago that the musical appeared to be making a comeback. Moulin Rouge and Chicago provided energetic examples of how singing and dancing could be as fun in a movie theater as on a stage. But the last 13 months have been ruinous. In December 2004 there was the disastrous The Phantom of the Opera. November 2005 saw Rent undergoing foreclosure. Now comes The Producers. Audiences may be kinder to this movie but it lacks anything resembling charm or wit. Its a bore. It takes the flaws of the 1968 production and exacerbates them by dragging out a story that already seems too long. And the musical numbers rather than enhancing things extend the proceedings without adding any substantial entertainment value. The producers who embark upon the scam are Max Bailystock (Nathan Lane) a veteran of financing bad plays (his previous effort ""Funny Boy"" - a musical version of ""Hamlet"") and his accountant Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick). They choose the worst material they can find - ""Springtime for Hitler"" by neo-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Will Ferrell). After wearing swastikas to appeal to Franz they hire Roger De Bris (Gary Beach) to direct it. He has a reputation of making everything ""gay"" and decides to change the ending to make it more upbeat by letting Germany win the war. Max and Leo also hire a Swedish secretary Ulla (Uma Thurman) who promptly falls in love with Leo. With The Producers Susan Stroman is making her feature debut. Highly respected and much lauded for her Broadway and off-Broadway work she comes to the film with no real experience about what works on the screen and it shows. Her actors emote like theyre trying to reach a live audience. Theres no sense of visual style. The movie sits on the screen and stagnates and the overacting of Lane Broderick Ferrell Beach and Thurman is more often irritating than it is effective. The movie borrows about 90% of its comedy from the 1968 edition and if anything its less funny this time around. Most of The Producers wallows in dated jokes that have lost their capacity to make a movie audience laugh out loud. Occasional chuckles are about the best they can do. Then there are the songs which are easily some of the most forgettable musical numbers from any production in recent years. Leaving the theater the only one I could remember was ""Springtime for Hitler"" and thats because it was in the original movie. Generally speaking I am a fan of movie musicals but this one fails on too many levels to make it worthwhile. Despite the overacting and the zealous attempts of stars Lane and Broderick to channel Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder (who played their parts in the original) there is no energy. The pacing is awful - scenes drag on for too long. When it was first released The Producers garnered criticism for being in bad taste. I suppose the charge is true but bad taste can be fun. Thats not the movies flaw. Instead the central problem with The Producers is that its an exercise in tedium.

Written and directed by Mel Brooks at the dawn of his moviemaking career the film may not have quite scaled the hysterical heights of those two diamond-cut comic gems that would soon follow -- Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein -- but it nevertheless offered 90 minutes of unadulterated comic bliss thanks in no small measure to the graceful pas de deux between Mostels shabby grandiloquence and Wilders wiry mania.The Producers has been resurrected twice since then as a Broadway musical and now as a movie musical based on the Broadway one and in the first instance the results were about as lively as a corpse exhumed from a vat of formaldehyde. In fairness I missed Brooks and director Susan Stromans Tony-lauded 2001 Broadway production with Nathan Lane cast as Bialystock and Matthew Broderick as Bloom so my impressions of the stage version derive from the 2003 touring company that took up extended residence at the Pantages Theater starring the woefully miscast duo of Jason Alexander and Martin Short. But even separating out those subpar leads The Producers onstage -- expanded to two and one-half hours with some 18 songs where there once were just two -- seemed to diffuse and flatten out (or else render unbearably shrill) all that was sharp compact and perfectly pitched about Brooks original conception. What was once subversive and sly had become a writ-large minstrel show with all the comic threat of talent night in a retirement home. (Did we really for example need an entire production number called ""Make It Gay"" -- complete with Village People-costumed chorus line -- where the mere appearance of Springtime for Hitlers cross-dressing director Roger De Bris and his hissing prancing ""secretary"" Carmen Ghia had earlier sufficed just fine?)The musical film version of The Producers is for better or worse a faithful record of the stage production adhering to the same if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it philosophy that informed the recent Rent overseen by a director (Stroman) who shows such little moviemaking aptitude that she makes Chris Columbus look like Vincente Minnelli. In her film-directing debut Stroman seems torn between a full-on indulgence of theatrical artificiality and the desire to achieve a more realistic atmosphere restricting most of the scenes to airless reproductions of the stage shows sets but occasionally (and very awkwardly) allowing a sequence to spill out onto the streets of the real Manhattan -- which only reinforces the pictures neither-here-nor-there tone. And while the preview audience with which I saw The Producers felt compelled to applaud after each musical number I was personally moved to ovation only on those rare occasions when Stroman actually moved her camera. (As in Rent theres only one fluidly musical sequence though perversely this one is relegated to after the end credits.)But on one crucial count Stroman delivers She gives us Broderick and Lane -- living proof that a little casting can go a very long way. In truth Broderick isnt especially good; when he strives for Wilders shrieking vocal inflections and spastic physicality the whole performance feels like a put-on. Lane by contrast manages to tip his hat to Mostel while investing the role with an oily-haired potbellied brio all his own -- even if you dont believe for a second that anyone (even the octogenarian biddies Max ""services"" in exchange for their funding of his plays) would risk mistaking Lane for a straight man. Theres a tinge of exhaustion to both performances the sense that Broderick and Lane (who did two tours of Broadway duty each while Lane also played the role in London) have gone through these motions far too many times to extract any further joy from them. Yet together they still give off a spark -- theyre greater than the sum of their parts.The movie shows signs of life in other respects too. Uma Thurman has it and flaunts it as the jiggling Swedish receptionist/ingenue Ulla while the mere sight of Will Ferrell in lederhosen as Springtime for Hitlers gently psychotic author Franz Liebkind is a singularly pleasurable event. Musically speaking Brooks (who wrote all of the songs) doesnt exactly give George Gershwin a run for his money but theres a breezy simplicity to his jaunty vaudeville melodies that after the one-two punch of Rent and The Phantom of the Opera is like salve on a throbbing wound. Such accomplishments dont quite assuage The Producers to-the-rafters bombast or the unrelenting wink-wink nod-nod self-gratification that plays even worse onscreen than it did onstage but they do help to make the film more of a passable time filler than a celluloid torture chamber and in movie-musical times like these I suppose one shouldnt look a gift horse in the mouth.Besides I wouldnt put it past Brooks that this whole thing might be one big elaborate prank whose punch line is still to come. In the fourth season of Larry Davids Curb Your Enthusiasm Brooks guest-starred as himself inviting the tone-deaf two-left-footed David to join the Broadway company of The Producers precisely (it was eventually revealed) because hed grown weary of the shows enormous popularity and yearned to stage his own Bialystock-worthy act of sabotage. But of course people loved the show anyway. So it may be that as audiences queue up for this latest incarnation of Brooks undying brainchild -- not unlike the patrons who turn back to their seats mid-exit during the opening-night performance of Springtime for Hitler -- the joke is on them. And Brooks is laughing all the way to the bank.THE PRODUCERS | Directed by SUSAN STROMAN | Written by MEL BROOKS and THOMAS MEEHAN based on the 2001 musical and 1968 movie written by BROOKS | Produced by BROOKS and JONATHAN SANGER | Released by Universal Pictures | At the Grove A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Contact Scott Foundas Follow L.A.

So determinedly old-fashioned it makes a strong claim to being the best film musical of 1959 ""The Producers"" comes full circle back to the screen 38 years after the original with much if not all of its mirth intact. Reproducing Mel Brooks still-running Broadway smash so literally you can practically see the proscenium arch new pic is undeniably stagy even clunky and its commercial fate rests on whether auds find the blunt theatrical artifice and playing-to-the-balcony performance style off-putting or endearing. Older viewers should turn this exuberant sometimes hilarious picture into a moderate hit domestically for Universal although Sony/Columbias prospects overseas look shaky. With most of the key cast and creative personnel from the legit production returning for the screen rendition Brooks obviously did not want to mess with success even though just turning the cameras on a winning stage venture doesnt guarantee bigscreen success. Given that ""The Producers"" is all about putting on a show its entirely proper the picture retains its theatrical feel. Still its been a very long time since a stage musical was so minimally reconceived for motion pictures. Its hard to guess how many of those who go to this latest incarnation of ""The Producers"" will be seeing it for the first time. Presumably most people are familiar with the classic premise in which unscrupulous theater producer Max Bialystock enlists uptight accountant Leo Bloom in a scheme to make a pot of money from a play designed to be a one-night flop. A seeming majority of the scenes are devoted to someone usually Max trying to convince somebody else to do something that no one in their right mind would do. In the long opening scene in his messy office across from Sardis the desperate Max attempts to convince ever-cautious Leo to go into business with him. The high-pitched hysteria at which this scene is played by Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick who made the roles their own and then some in the Tony-drenched 2001 Broadway production generates some concerns about where the tone of the movie can possibly go from here as does stage helmer and choreographer Susan Stromans uncertainty about where to place the camera other than front-row center (its worth remembering that Brooks own direction of the 1967 original was pretty rudimentary). Helping get the pic off the soundstage is ""Along Came Bialy"" in which little old ladies with walkers -- Maxs gullible investors -pursue Max across Fifth Avenue into Central Park. And while this number like most of the musical interludes doesnt pack quite the brassy knockout punch it did onstage pic has found its legs by the time Max and Leo set their sights on producing cant-miss disaster ""Springtime for Hitler."" No one including the reasonably cast Will Ferrell here could match the inspired lunacy of Kenneth Mars original turn as the demented fuehrer-loving playwright Franz Liebkind who has trained his pet pigeons to wing salute and gives his producers Nazi armbands to wear. But things switch into high gear when Max and Leo recruit cross-dressing director Roger De Bris (Gary Beach) to mount the production. Rogers aide de camp is played by Roger Bart as the ultimate swish mincing queen pushing the old stereotype so far with his endlessly held hissed ss rolled eyes and slinky manner that hes even more hilarious onscreen than he was onstage stealing every scene hes in even when relegated to the background. ""The Producers"" reaches it peak on the tumultuous opening night with Max and Leo confident the cats in the bag when the glamorous crowd reacts with gaping stupefaction at the shows melodious paean to Adolf and the choreographed conquest of Europe staged in gloriously over-the-top style. Its only when De Bris steps in for the injured Franz as Hitler and sits on the edge of the stage Judy Garland-style that the fleeing audience is won over. With hundreds of performances in New York and London under their belts Lane and Broderick have their characterizations down cold. As the manic Max Lane is big broad and massively entertaining great at belting out his songs and undone only somewhat in what onstage was his triumphant moment the recapitulation number ""Betrayed."" Originally done at an even more breakneck pace the tour de force is performed from Maxs jail cell and for maximum effect should have been presented in one take. Instead Stroman has cut it into bits and pieces trying to lend it extra energy when none is needed. Broderick proves an effectively uptight foil but is alternately overly shrill and frozen-pasty in the early going before loosening up to win the favors of the va-va-voom office secretary played by a game but ultimately miscast Uma Thurman. Snappy tunes which possess the old-time Broadway spirit infused with Catskills-style irreverent humor keep things bouncing along and Mark Friedbergs production design and William Ivey Longs costumes rejoice in their self-conscious theatricality. End credits provide the opportunity for entirely appropriate curtain calls capped by a shot of Brooks himself telling any stragglers ""Get out Its over"" The ProducersProductionA Universal (in U.S.) Columbia (international) release of a Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures presentation of a Brooksfilms production.
