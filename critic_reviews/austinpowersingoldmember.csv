"Austin Powers in Goldmember an ode to indecent joy. Slate Sign In Sign Up Austin Powers in Goldmember an ode to indecent joy. Austin Powers in Goldmember an ode to indecent joy. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 26 2002 1202 PM The Man With the Midas Schlong Austin Powers in Goldmember is an ode to indecent joy; The Kid Stays in the Picture is almost as trippy. By David Edelstein Austin Powers in Goldmember In the zone baby Let us quickly dispel the notion that a great low comedy demands a great narrative--or a narrative at all. Coherence? Consistency? Suspense? Oh behave. Those who complain that Austin Powers inGoldmember (New Line) is less a real movie than a bloated grab bag of infantile jokes dont seem to be in on the only joke that matters. Mike Myers is like a rich 12-year-old who rents out F.A.O. Schwartz upends every toy in under two hours and brings in strippers. He can get away with this privileged romp because he grooves on what he does in a way that none of his contemporaries--the people who put out such swill as Men in Black II and Mr. Deeds--can comprehend. I liked the last Austin Powers movie ( The Spy Who Shagged Me [1999]) but I adore Goldmember. Its rudely free-associational like scatological scat-singing like a hallucination on the themes of 60s and 70s pop culture by someone who longs to have been there and has the next-best thing to a time machine. Its an ode to indecent joy. Advertisement The movie opens badly--almost fatally--with a flurry of big-star cameos that might have seemed like a good idea but have nowhere to go The star appears the star gets a laugh the star exits. The director Jay Roach cant give these showstoppers any momentum and the fun palls quickly Scattershot but thudding it made me want to bolt after 15 minutes. Things begin to perk up with a rollicking number ""Daddy Wasnt There"" written by Matthew Sweet and Myers and performed by ""Ming Tea featuring Austin Powers"" with lots of cute girls (birds) dancing and the camera zooming in and out. Then Austin visits Dr. Evil in prison in a Silence of the Lambs (1991) parody; theres a flashback to young Austin at school razzed by a young (bald) Evil when his feckless dad Sir Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) doesnt show up for graduation; then hes time-traveling back to 1975 to a roller-disco where Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra is warbling ""Hey Goldmember"" in a gold bikini and a new movie goddess is born. Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra a movie goddess is born Im admittedly puzzled about the Dutch supervillain Goldmember (Myers) a bizarre speckled creation with a habit of peeling off flakes of gold skin and announcing ""Dats a keeper."" It has been a couple of decades since Ive been to Holland so I have no idea what Myers is parodying--or if the mere idea of making fun of the Dutch is supposed to be a side-splitter. Maybe Im just nostalgic for ethnic humor--because after awhile I was roaring at every Dutch joke like some kind of Belgian. But by then Goldmember had found its rhythm with Dr. Evil doing a gangsta-rap version of ""Its the Hard Knock Life"" from Annie with Evil and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) tiptoeing past prison-yard spotlights in a bit that could have bubbled up from the collective unconscious of comedy. The writers Myers and Michael McCullers pluck zingers out of the air juggle them and toss them away with a flourish. Theyre in the zone baby. Goldmember is bigger than some of the Bond movies it parodies but its lighter on its feet than Casino Royale (1967) or any of the boorishly unmoored secret-agent comedies of the 60s. Theres a disconcerting mole-adorned mole (Fred Savage) in Dr. Evils organization (""Nice to mole you. Meet you."") and the best subtitles gag Ive ever seen. Fat Bastard is back but the poop jokes dont come as thick and fast this time Its the piss jokes that will slay you. Theres another smutty shadow play--silhouettes doing seemingly ghastly (sexual) things behind a screen--that might be the most gut-busting two or three minutes Ive spent in a theater. Slapstick can be a religious experience I imagine my Yiddish ancestors being reduced to puddles by routines like this and giving thanks to the great vaudevillian in the sky. Winded hacking my belly aching I still have a couple of piddly quibbles. The Britney Spears cameo is too much like the Pepsi commercial and all the product placements (not as wall-to-wall as last time but there are still too many) add a sticky note of commerce. The musical numbers more or less end in the first 45 minutes and theyre sensational enough to warrant one or two more in the second half. And it must be said (not for the first time) that no one except Myers really has a chance to cut loose. The dishy Knowles is just a straight man; Caine doesnt have enough material to live up to his great snaggletoothed Cockney aplomb; and Myers plays most of the other characters. Id like to see him whip up some crazy shtick for the few farceur impressionists in his league--for the likes of Dana Carvey Martin Short Chris Kattan Lisa Kudrow Jan Hooks and Andrea Martin. But if Myers is the whole show here hes a shagadelic one. You leave thinking you smoked something fantastic and wishing it werent so many years between hits. Robert Evans (left) buddies up with Roman Polanski The Kid Stays in the Picture (USA Films) a documentary based on the memoir by former studio head and super-producer Robert Evans is another sort of pipe dream this one forged in the 20th century by Jews running a studio hanging by the pool with movie stars and shtupping heartstopping (mostly shiksa) actresses. The film directed by Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein is a breezy hoot and its gorgeous to look at with photos of Evans (who takes great photos) and assorted beautiful people drifting like 3-D cutouts over the swanky Hollywood backdrops. Evans delivers the narration which is heavily distilled from the book--too heavily I think. Many of the juicy details about sundry stars and directors are gone (perhaps Graydon Carter a co-producer didnt want to alienate any Vanity Fair cover subjects); whats left skips buoyantly along the surface. Evidently the richest material had no corresponding audiovisuals. No thats not entirely true. In the films coup Evans recounts how in 1970 when Paramounts board of directors was on the verge of pulling the plug (the studio was in last place financially among the majors) he and Mike Nichols quickly made a movie--a presentation hosted by Evans on the subject of Paramounts rosy prospects. And then we see it an amazing piece of showmanship in which the young studio head finds just the right blend of modesty and braggadocio. The sudden present tense is startling We are there. In the book and documentary Evans emerges as an agreeable (by Hollywood standards) nutcase who managed to succeed by generating publicity--which is the same way he plummeted after a cocaine bust and such scandalous failures as the 1984 monstrosity The Cotton Club (about which he writes cogently). At arms length he is certainly an endearing character. The book-on-tape (read by Evans) of The Kid Stays in the Picture became a cult item and renewed the producers celebrity; the movie unfortunately illustrates things that are best left to the haze of memory such as the acting career of Evans most beloved ex Ali MacGraw. Evans is delightful on the subject of Charles Bludhorn the Gulf amp; Western executive who lifted him from the ranks of wannabes on the strength of a Peter Bart profile in the New York Times; and hes suitably appreciative of Jack Nicholson who used his power to avert Evans financial and emotional ruin. But its unclear what we are to make of his paeans to Henry Kissinger who did Evans a turn by showing up for the Godfather premiere on the eve of a crucial Vietnam War summit. Evans regards this as an act of friendship and not feckless star-fucking Should Kissinger ever go on trial for war crimes guess wholl be producing movies for the defense? David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Its a Gas Man washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Its a Gas Man Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 26 2002 ""Austin Powers in Goldmember "" is puerile pitiful grotesque offensive immature repulsive and of course extremely funny. Possibly it helps to be 12 and pretty much unsocialized. Perhaps it helps to believe passionately that jokes involving orifices and their work-product are hilarious. Perhaps it helps if you like Mike Myers so much you dont really care if hes gotten larger and larger like a runaway zeppelin while his co-stars get smaller and smaller. Look quick and youll note Robert Wagner behind his Hathaway-man eye patch as No. 2 but mostly he just stands there looking bored. Michael Caine is also in the film in the role of Powerss father Nigel but I can recollect nothing of his performance. The plot is the usual meltdown of story situations from the James Bond oeuvre blown out to imbecile proportions and completely disconnected from any cause-effect theory of reality. I suppose the antecedent is ""Goldfinger"" the excellent Bond film from 1964 in which the superb German actor Gert Frobe played a gold-obsessed sociopath whose plan was to nuke the gold reserve at Fort Knox so as to increase the value of his own holdings. His best line came when Sean Connerys Bond splayed on a table and about to be eviscerated by a laser asked Goldfinger if he expected him to talk ""No Mr. Bond I expect you to die."" Theres no line as smart or memorable as that in ""Goldmember"" but then Bond didnt crack nearly as many flatulence jokes. This variant replaces the bomb with an asteroid which Dr. Evil (Myers) the Dutch psychopath Goldmember (Myers - and boys and girls can you figure out why they call him ""Goldmember""?) and the Scottish bully Fat Bastard (Myers) draw into collision with Earth to disastrous consequences. Why do they want to do this? I must have missed that part. Anyhow they are opposed in this effort by swingin 60s Brit secret agent Austin (Myers) in Carnaby Street colors with bad teeth froufrou shirts and Edwardian jackets in shades of paisley and plaid unseen this side of a bad LSD experience. The only key part that Myers doesnt play is Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) the pint-size clone of Evil. But hes probably working on a way to do that next time. That would be a shame. Troyer alone among the regulars gets a real showcase. He has developed into a skillful film performer at least within the narrow confines of the Austin Powers series. He plays extremely well off Myers in whatever role Myers happens to be occupying at the time; I loved to watch the flow of bafflement and illumination on that tiny face of his. Hes the one actor who can stand against the Myers juggernaut and walk away unscathed. Even token beauty Beyonce Knowles of Destinys Child registers dimly as Foxxy Cleopatra a 70s-style jive-talking FBI agent who gets into the picture via time travel probably the seriess weakest stroke. But the level of inventiveness remains high. Another reliable source of comedy is the appearance of various uptown movie celebs who are obviously delighted to be included in the fun. Youd be surprised how high-powered some of these folks are. Id tell you who they are but Id be killed shortly thereafter so best leave it at that. Of course what really drives the film is Myers. The brazenness of his ego is dwarfed only by the size of his talent and in this one he really lets rip. The core of it is the true narcissists shamelessness He has no repression holding him back and you cant embarrass him. Thus all his characters with the exception of Fat B. (rather diminished in this film) have a sublimely unique way of moving slightly effeminate a projection of softness and decadence. Its not that theyre gay its just that theyre in that zone of sexual androgyny whose most salient aspect is a lack of connection to either sex. Their swishiness expresses nothing except the idea that swishiness is funny; it is original unto itself. (Martin Short another fabulous Canadian talent who graduated from ""Saturday Night Live"" has the same powerful vibration.) This is only amplified when as he frequently does in a variety of guises Myers is moved to dance. Hes a very bad dancer yet his utter lack of fear and shame is the fuel that drives the charming power of his rottenness. The world has entirely too many excellent dancers; it needs more bad ones.

The Spy Who Shagged Me from 1999 was on the spotty (and potty) side and the second sequel takes an even more haphazard approach. Goldmember has an excess of raunchy jokes and as many locales and shifting time frames as Mike Myers has disguises. Oh behave people -- or at least put your script through a few more drafts. Yet the series has been able to produce a most crowd-pleasing opening scene -- one the movie fails to match until a spattering of brilliantly constructed gags in its middle hour. Only a cad would divulge (though some already have) which household-name director and which A-list superstars have been recruited to make pre-credits cameo appearances in a mock screen production of Austinpussy. After that the plot gets convoluted. Dr. Evil begins the real movie by literally going Hollywood (industry jokes abound) then ends with him taking a plunge in a submarine. In between theres a flashback to Austins school days when he and the doc were already at odds. Austin time-travels to 1975 and a sexed-up New York club called Studio 69. There he hooks up again with a 70s action queen named Foxxy Cleopatra -- a striking presence thanks to Beyonce Knowles outlandish but dynamite makeup and costuming. (She is however less of a series force than Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham.) Lead Mike Myers obviously has the Austin/Evil yin-yang down pat though Verne Troyers still priceless Mini Me gets more laughs than either. Myers also reprises Spys weakest link the Fat Bastard character and gets nothing out of the newly introduced Goldmember a Dutchman whose name describes his claim to fame. Series regulars Robert Wagner (eye-patched Number Two) Michael York (Basil Exposition) Mindy Sterling (Frau Farbissina) and Seth Green (a balding Scott Evil) are given little. Michael Caine promisingly cast as Austins father carries the same randy gene but walks through his part. Yet Myers is among comedy royalty when getting laughs by strategically standing beside a peeing fountain statue or behind a shadowy screen. Several scenes are in the most classic of comic traditions but theres always a feeling weve seen something like them before -- in previous Powers outings no less. The Powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many no question. But this time theres some mold on the gold.

Starring Mike Myers Michael Caine and Beyonce Knowles. Directed by Jay Roach. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 96 minutes.) ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" arrived in theaters this summer with all the ""event movie"" excitement associated with an action blockbuster. The energy flows not just from the audience but also from the picture itself with its deluge of A-list celebrities in cameo appearances and its strategy that piles on jokes and pushes them until theyre no longer funny . . . and then pushes some more until theyre funnier than ever. The novelty of the series may be lost. Austin himself is not as comic a character as he once was -- maybe thats inevitable. But familiarity brings other pleasures not the least of which is the sense of a shared experience. With ""Goldmember"" the Austin Powers series enters that coveted land once inhabited by Peter Sellers ""Pink Panther"" movies. Audiences bring an affection for the characters and a happy anticipation of a certain kind of joke. And ""Goldmember"" delivers. True much of what it delivers is gross and idiotic. There are more poo-poo and penis jokes here than you can shake a stick at. But series creator Mike Myers who plays Austin combines his toilet-humor sensibility with a highly developed comic inventiveness. In one scene Austin and Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer) are behind a screen casting a shadow that suggests all kinds of lewd and bizarre things that arent really happening. The new movie pits Austin against a new villain Goldmember (also played by Myers) whose fixation with gold brought about a gruesome smelting accident involving his genitalia. The story is complicated but disposable serving only as an excuse to bring on all the characters audiences want to see. Anyone who takes so many chances is bound to fail some of the time. Not all the jokes in ""Goldmember"" hit the mark. Still there are enough laughs that entire lines of dialogue are missed and that says something. . This film contains sexual situations lewd humor.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

The first installment Austin Powers International Man of Mystery -- an oddly sui generis spoof on the James Bond series and probably funniest the third time you saw it -- was only a moderate theatrical success before going on to find mass popularity in its video and cable afterlife. The second film Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me was a consolidation of the first a greatest-hits package and grossed more in its first three days than the previous film did in its entire theatrical run. With returns like that a third installment was inevitable. Austin Powers in Goldmember finds the swinging snaggle-toothed secret agent battling a nefarious scheme that includes a kidnapping a Star Warslike tractor beam and traveling back in time to 1975. Why 1975 is not exactly clear other than that it lays down a runway for flashy new costumes and some jokes about roller-disco plus an opportunity to provide its ""syupah"" hero with a blaxploitation-derived sidekick Foxxy Cleopatra (Destinys Child diva and hair-care spokesperson Beyonce Knowles doing a spirited if unimpressive imitation of Pam Grier). But to demand logic or narrative cohesion of Myers his co-writer Michael McCullers or director Jay Roach is to be something of a stick-in-the-mud. The basic premise of the Austin Powers cycle -- 60s swinger in uptight nowadays -- has proved to be a remarkably elastic one giving the filmmakers an extremely broad field from which to pick their satirical targets. At times feeling like a college revue or last months Mad magazine the movie includes references to Spider-Man and The Osbournes a handful of cameos by Really Big Celebrities and jokes along the way about Britpop trucker movies subtitling Hollywood talent agencies Viagra rap videos those frickin Dutch and the way asparagus makes your pee smell funny. In other words ""When in doubt tell a toilet joke."" The laugh always comes first and Myers puppy-dog tenacity to that cast-iron tenet of low comedy disarming and even somewhat charming in the first film now has an air of careerist desperation about it. Probably the series biggest liability (after lazy plotting) is that none of the secondary villains can top the original Dr. Evil (Myers again) a sharper wittier creation than Austin Powers himself. Far from adding anything substantial to the mix new character Goldmember (and again) along with the previously introduced Fat Bastard (and yet again) ends up playing to the series overall weaknesses. The real added value here comes from Michael Caines appearance as Austins father Nigel. Appearing in essentially three scenes he brings an offhanded easygoing charm to his part a take on his own 60s spy character Harry Palmer. Unfortunately Caine is also saddled with the task of delivering the films ridiculous final plot twist whereby the true nature of the relationship between Austin and Dr. Evil is revealed. Resistance however is futile in the face of the sound commerce these films have become. Like a group of deranged comedy scientists Myers and Co. know just how long they can flail about for stray laughs before delivering a sure-fire set piece (many of these simply extensions of jokes from the previous films) that jolts the audience awake. Austin Powers in Goldmember could (generously) be thought of as an extended parody of the Roger Mooreera Bond films which filled their quotas of girls gadgets and action but for the sake of which no one was exactly rocking the boat. Formula must be followed after all -- and like one of his power-mad nemeses Austin Powers will certainly be back.

However it is a mildly amusing mess even though the premise -- and the shagadelic 60s and 70s -- are getting a wee bit long in the tooth. Mike Myers and company have once again mined the deepest trenches of the penis joke genre and even die-hard fans must be feeling the wear and tear of finding humor down there. But there are just enough new gags and new characters -- such as the huge-haired detective Foxxy Cleopatra (a sendup of blaxploitation films from the 70s) played by Beyonce Knowles of the singing group Destinys Child -- to keep things percolating during the films hyper-paced 94-minute running time. Many of the usual suspects are back. Leading the pack of returning characters is Mini-Me once again beautifully played by Verne Troyer. Robert Wagner as Number Two Seth Green as Scott Evil Michael York as Basil Exposition and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina all reprise their roles. Wagner however is completely underutilized and could have sat this one out. RESOURCES EW.COM All about Austin Powers in Goldmember EW.COM Goldmember photo gallery EW.COM Review Myers cameos make Goldmember groovy This time around the plot (such as it is) centers around Daddy issues. Thats right Daddy issues. Austin gets no respect from his daddy the flamboyant secret agent Nigel Powers played to perfection by Michael Caine and Dr. Evil pampers his cloned son (and smaller self) Mini-Me while his real son Scott is more or less ignored. The whole ""whos your daddy"" issue comes to a surprising conclusion in the films finale. Business as usual Along the way to that conclusion its business as usual in the wacky world of Austin Powers. There are plenty of inside jokes referring to the two previous ""Powers"" films numerous spoofs of other films such as ""Singin In The Rain"" and tons of bad dental work. Of course the casting of Caine as a superspy brings along lots of nostalgic baggage of its own -- recalling his ""Harry Palmer"" spy movies as well as his classic 60s film ""Alfie."" Plus the sight of Caine with the Austin familys bad teeth is worth the price of admission -- almost. Once again directed by Jay Roach and co-written by Myers and Michael McCullers this third installment is beginning to feel a little repetitive (as if the second one wasnt?). Myers reprises his multiple roles in ""Goldmember"" and takes on yet another persona. As always Myers takes on numerous roles Powers Dr. Evil Fat Bastard and the newest addition to his repertoire the title character Goldmember. Featuring a golden complexion wispy hair and a padded crotch that defies gravity Goldmember is a double-jointed Dutchman whose lust for gold is matched only by his gross ability to put his legs behind his head -- thereby displaying the aforementioned crotch in all its glory. So there you go penis jokes flatulence excrement and urination continue to rule in the land of ""Austin Powers."" Where else would you find a weapon designed to destroy the world being called ""Preparation H?"" Its amusing but you may find that youre over it. Still will there be an ""Austin Powers IV""? Probably. ""Austin Powers In Goldmember"" opens nationwide on Friday July 26 and is rated PG-13 with a running time of 94 minutes.

"Austin Powers in Goldmember | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; austin-powers-in-goldmember ) Austin Powers in Goldmember (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli When Mike Myers and Jay Roach introduced the world to Austin Powers International Man of Mystery in 1997 their intention was to make a one-off spoof of James Bond movies and 60s culture. The movie did okay at the box office then exploded in popularity once it hit home video. The result was 1999s Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me which achieved blockbuster status. Thus was born another franchise with deeper roots in money and popularity than in creativity. Would the movie-going world be any worse off without Austin Powers in Goldmember? Absolutely not but New Line Cinema wanted their piece of the 2002 summer box office and this was their only legitimate shot at it. (Its hard to take issue with them though since they risked a lot of money on Peter Jacksons initially unproven The Lord of the Rings trilogy.) In all fairness to the film it is superior to the disappointing second movie in the series. The comedy is about as low-brow as it can get (at least without treading into R-rated territory). There are characters named ""Fook Mi"" and ""Fook Yu"" a mole the size of a fingernail and the obligatory sexual innuendo. Gross-out humor abounds from the flatulence of Fat Bastard to the truly disgusting behavior of the newest villain Goldmember (who peels off bits of dried skin and eats them). And the movie isnt hard-up for penis jokes which comprise about 1/3 of the films laugh-inducing material. Subtle witticisms and incisive satire are not common - those elements would be above the heads of the target teen audience. Not that the avalanche of crude humor is all bad. When it works it can be hilarious (as is the case on several occasions). But when it fails it comes across as badly conceived and juvenile. (The ""looser"" you are the more likely you are to appreciate Goldmember - not that Im advocating imbibing beforehand.) For Goldmember the versatile Mike Myers adds a fourth character. In addition to playing Austin his nemesis Dr. Evil and the unbelievably obese Scotsman Fat Bastard (whos only in a few scenes) Myers essays Goldmember a twisted associate of Dr. Evil who lost his genitals in a smelting accident. Goldmember who looks like a Star Trek reject wants to destroy the world using a tractor beam (codenamed ""Preparation H"") aimed at a solid gold asteroid. For some reason he has also kidnapped Austins dad Nigel. As the International Man of Mysterys father Michael Caine has an opportunity to put his mimicry skills to the test (Nigel evidences many of the same mannerisms as Austin). Caine who was Harry Palmer in the 60s series of spy movies based on Len Deightons novels gets a chance to try out the lighter side of the kind of character he once played seriously. BeyoncA(c) Knowles is Blaxsploitation-inspired Foxxy Cleopatra Austins latest love interest. While the ""Destinys Child"" performer shows better comic timing than Heather Graham she displays minimal screen presence and fades into the background whenever possible. Fred Savage all grown up is Number Three a man with an obvious facial disfigurement. And the ""regulars"" - Basil Exposition (Michael York) Number Two (Robert Wagner) Scott Evil (Seth Green) Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) and Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer) - are all back. As was true of the previous Austin Powers films this one uses the saturation approach to comedy - throw so many jokes at the audience that even if only a fraction of them stick the final product will be deemed funny. When Goldmember is delivering its best material its a highly entertaining experience. The first ten minutes represent the movies pinnacle - a cameo-rich sequence that starts out as a parody of a spoof before turning into a surreal musical production number. Later there are naughty subtitles and a vulgar-but-clever bit featuring some unusual ""shadow puppetry"". Theres also a gratuitous trip back to the 70s that features new lyrics to some K.C. and the Sunshine Band tunes and a brief lip-synching appearance by Nathan Lane. In between all of this however we are treated to a lot of grotesque comedy thats more likely to turn stomachs than provoke laughter re-treads of jokes from the other Austin Powers outings and new stuff that lacks inspiration or dilutes its source material. (The ""Fook Mi/Fook Yu"" routine echoes Abbott and Costellos ""Whos on First?"" and the Mole-on-the-Face-Avoidance recalls a skit from ""The Germans"" episode of ""Fawlty Towers"".) One of the blessings of Goldmember is that its only 90 minutes long but after three Austin Powers installments thats 4 1/2 hours spent in the company of this goofy band of characters. Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating. Its a tribute to the popularity of the International Man of Mystery that hes still going strong even if comedic aptitude of his adventures is losing steam. (Austin Powers is no Inspector Closeau but he could end up becoming as long-running a character as the Blake Edwards/Peter Sellers creation.) If Mike Myers and Jay Roach want to get out of the rut they have fallen into theyre going to have to do a little innovation next time Austin Powers reaches the screens.

Well maybe for a million - okay for 10000 simoleons. Anything less isnt enough to divulge the huge celebrities in one of the most delirious state-of-entertainment digests since Terrance and Phillip sang ""Uncle Fka"" in ""South Park Bigger Longer amp; Uncut."" Instead Ill just suggest that the caliber of guests eager to be seen under the same glitter ball with Austin Powers is a credit to the in-crowd popularity of the groovy International Man of Mystery in his third caper. And more specifically its recognition of Jay Roachs shagadelic creativity in directing the further adventures of Mike Myers velveteen-covered comic creation with such tossed-off zest Theres more moviemaking comedy verve (and nerve) in the first 15 minutes of ""Goldmember"" - and intermittently throughout this extravagant uneven retro-happy celebration of the movies as international setters of indelible style - than there is in all of ""Scooby-Doo"" ""Mr. Deeds"" and ""Men in Black II"" combined. Theyre back baby way back in this biggest-yet installment almost all the usual swingers Austin and his nemesis Dr. Evil; the docs rebellious son Scott (Seth Green) and malleable pocket-size clone Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer); the various employees of Evils enterprises including Number Two with his eye patch (Robert Wagner) and Frau Farbissina with her spit curls (Mindy Sterling); that guy who explains stuff like someone always does on spy TV shows Basil Exposition (Michael York); and even the hideous hairy mountain of Scottish flesh and fetidness known as Fat Bastard. Myers plays Austin Evil and Fat again and adds another hard-to-miss personage to his repertoire the nefarious freckled Dutch roller-skating playboy and criminal mastermind Johann van der Smut known as Goldmember who regularly interrupts his nasty pursuits (e.g. a plan for world domination dubbed ""Preparation H"" ) to taste falling flakes of his own sun-roasted skin. For all the rococo outrageousness of the old cast for all the culty comfy campy pleasure in watching familiar cartoon characters reiterate familiar behavior (pinkie to mouth all over again) something just this side of shagaphobia results from too much exposure to too much Austin too much Evil and certainly too much Fat Bastard. Immediately following the glorious curtain-raiser when the usual rhythms of Dr. Evils conference room set in the energy drops precipitously like blood sugar once a Snickers high has worn off. And you may find yourself thinking ""Here comes that costumed midget again."" Or musing ""What ever happened to that Elizabeth Hurley?"" But not for long not once the movies mojo gets working. Whats golden about ""Goldmember"" and jolly clever too is how Roach Myers and Myers cowriter former ""SNL"" hand Michael McCullers quickly and gracefully transfer the weight of mayhem off Austins Carnaby Street-clad shoulders and on to a whole new set of characters. The toothy spy himself indeed is almost always seen in conflict or collaboration with other exotically unfamiliar players. And none is more right as rain under the circumstances than Michael Caine cast as the gods always ordained as Austins Ur-swinging spy dad Nigel. Its enough of a cheeky treat that Caine has joined the orgy His own 1960s movie spy work (in spectacles baby) as Harry Palmer in such movies as ""The Ipcress File"" inspired the Britophiliac style of Mike Myers oeuvre in the first place - a cockney ello that pops out of the corners where James Bond and Peter Sellers couldnt reach. Its even more sublime-y to send Austin and Nigel back for various mysterious reasons to 1975 the era of roller discos and blaxploitation queen Pam Grier if only so that Austin can reunite with his old partner and shag honey Foxxy Cleopatra. Beyonce Knowles comely third of the best-selling girl group Destinys Child is far softer in her feature-film acting debut as Foxxy than the original Afro chicks but Knowles sweetness plays nicely against the badass swagger of her talk and the fabulousness of her wardrobe and dos. (All props to costume designer Deena Appel for the threads.) ""Goldmember"" leaves a few skid marks. But considering the expectations heaped on ""APIII"" to top its predecessors the movie is remarkably spry and inspired even when roasting an old parody chestnut such as the meeting of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling (""Ive been expecting you"" Dr. Evil says in his maximum-security cell to the visiting Mr. Powers). And considering the desire to keep the big warm laughs coming theres something quiet and fine about the prequel subplot set back in the day when Austin and Dr. Evil were children Nigel was a younger dad too and the choice between becoming a force for good or evil took shape in the schoolyard. Mike Myers and Austin Powers may stick to their old Beatle boots but theyve both come a long way luvvy. For proof just look at all the A-list celebrities-I-wont-mention happy to crash the party.

Its been three years rather than two between Austin Powers films this time and Mike Myers and his buddies obviously spent the extra time expanding their repertoire of toilet jokes as the picture is clogged to overflowing with them. Allowing for this excess its strictly more of the same from the groovidelic shagmeister in ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" a picture that even more than the previous two feels like a bunch of gags tossed together. The laughs are here to be sure although even some of the best of them are retreads and the Swinging 60s recycling act is now feeling a bit past its zeitgeist prime. Still New Line will continue to mine this shaft of gold to rich rewards theatrically and in ancillary markets; while B.O. may not reach the astounding 310 million internationally snagged by 1999s ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" haul will certainly be much closer to that than to the modest 72 million earned worldwide by the first installment. In fact ""Goldmember"" spends very little time either in the 60s or in Blighty as it hops through time and around the globe following the blighted trail of Dr. Evil as he invites further showdowns with the International Man of Mystery. In full Pirandellian mode (and with New Line pleading with the press not to divulge the identities of the very big names making ""guest appearances"") this one begins with a jokily spectacular pre-credits action sequence toplining the biggest male movie star in the world in ""Austinpussy"" opposite a certain svelte Oscar-winning actress playing Dixienormous a two-time Oscar winning actor as Dr. Evil and a brash and diminutive actor-director as Mini Me all directed by the most famous filmmaker since Alfred Hitchcock who like Hitch has now been knighted. The in-jokes continue with the name New Line having been inscribed atop the Paramount gate a new Hollywood talent agency gaining supremacy over CAA ICM and all the rest by charging only 9% and finally Dr. Evil having established his lair behind the Hollywood sign. Its hardly depriving the picture of suspense to reveal as some mildly amusing flashbacks show that Austin Powers and Dr. Evils rivalry dates back to their school days at the Intelligence Academy and that Austin suffers from feelings of lifelong neglect by his father the illustrious super-agent Nigel Powers (Michael Caine). As devised by Myers and co-scripter Michael McCullers pics structure could not be more haphazard. Audience is reminded a couple of times that Dr. Evil once again intends to destroy the world this time in league with Myers new title character. Certainly not as memorable a creation as his three others for the series -- Austin Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard all reprised here -- Goldmember is a middle-aged yellow-haired Dutchman with weird Euro pronunciation who likes to eat the patches of skin that continually flake off his body and whose incinerated private parts have been replaced with a glowing golden rod. In practice theres not that much funny about him other than that he makes for a butt of highly arcane anti-Dutch jibes from the other characters. But he comes and goes quickly as Austin is outfitted for a trip to 1975 by Basil (Michael York) with a pimpmobile and Mack threads in order to make a grand entrance at Gothams Studio 69. In a genuinely clever sequence involving the most esteemed Broadway musical comedy star of his generation Austin makes the acquaintance of Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles) a singing supersleuth sistah who accompanies Austin on most of his subsequent adventures as he tries to resolve his relationship with his legendary dad while trying to work in tandem to thwart Dr. Evil and Goldmember. What counts of course are the comic set pieces which are just as erratic as they always have been in this series. Ranking toward the top is a prison musical number shot like a rap video in which a bunch of tough inmates led by Dr. Evil and Mini Me deliver a unique version of ""Its a Hard Knock Life"" from ""Annie."" Also delivering the yocks are a scene in which Austin having knocked an electric plug out of his socket must hide behind a peeing cherub fountain statue and somehow provide for the water effect himself in order not to be detected and a behind-the-screen scene at a doctors office that is hilarious despite being a total ripoff of the convulsive tent sequence in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me."" Fat Bastard caught with almost nothing on at a sumo contest in Tokyo is as gross as ever but an engagingly unlikely creation all the same and pic has fun with such other conceits as deliberately obscured subtitles -- the better to make them dirty -- and a submarine designed entirely in the image of Dr. Evil. But while much of the humor expectedly trades on ""member""ship double entendres rather more of it seems as though it were written in middle school bathrooms; its for a film like ""Goldmember"" that the PG-13 rating was invented. Myers is Myers-times-four this time doing shtick -- often opposite himself in the same frame -- thats usually fun even if its not terribly funny. The fetchingly beauteous Knowles in her major film debut after several years of success in the group Destinys Child displays promising screen presence despite having nothing much special to do. Given an unbecoming mouthful of Powers family teeth Caine as Dad was an inspired casting idea that likewise hasnt been anywhere near fully exploited. Remainder of the gang -- Seth Green as Dr. Evils punky petulant son Verne Troyer as the ever-frisky Mini Me Mindy Sterling as the evil ones enthusiastic assistant and Robert Wagner as his Number Two -- delivers as expected.
