Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Megan Garber Sep 28 2015 Culture When earlier this year Joan Didion posed for an ad for the French fashion house Celine ""the fashion Internet"" The New York Times gushed ""quivered in a way it hasnt at least since Kim Kardashian stripped nude for Paper magazine."" Some of the quivering certainly was due to the fact that Didion who long ago ascended to ""icon"" status has served as a role model for eager young writers. But the rest of it came from something more basic the sight at once refreshing and revolutionary of an older face--a face filled with soft wrinkles--in the pages of Vogue. I thought about that ad when I watched The Intern this weekend. On the one hand the film suffers from all the stuff recent Nancy Meyers films have suffered from (Rich People Problems White People Problems a general veneer of bland entitlement and perky malaise); on the other hand though it is in the universe of recent Nancy Meyers Films probably the best. Thats largely because of subtle compelling performances from Anne Hathaway and particularly Robert De Niro but its also because of the particular kind of rom-com The Intern is one that takes an expansive approach to the ""rom"" blessedly precluding the possibility of a sexual relationship between a 70-year-old man and a 30-something woman. (Thank you for that Nancy Meyers.)Related Story Lily Tomlin Is Not Your Typical Grandma But The Interns primary storyline also eschews the tired cliches of the rom-com by making the obligatory Thing That Divides the Couple in Question not circumstantial but generational. Ben (De Niro) is older; Jules (Hathaway) is younger; this is the key plot-driver of the film. The premise of The Intern--unquestioned and insisted-upon--is that Ben has something to offer Jules advice that is bolstered by wisdom. Caring that is nurtured by life experience.Call it the swami-com The Intern is at core the story of the relationship--softly nurturing mutually satisfying--that develops between a mentor and a mentee. And while there are many many complaints to be made about it as a piece of film and a piece of culture (see above and also pretty much every review thats been published about it thus far) the most redeeming thing is this The film respects insistently the wisdom of experience. It values what so many other cultural products implicitly and less so do not. It makes an assumption that is both traditional and subversive that the older person here has something to offer the younger person. Not just because of who he is but because of how old he is.This should not be such a strange premise for a film. It should be actually an extremely boring premise. And yet Its hard to think of other recent pieces of culture that adopt a similar attitude toward age. And its hard as well to think of portrayals of mentorship that take place outside the confines of the family. Sure theres Whiplash. Theres 30 Rock which makes repeated gags of the rules governing Jacks mentorship of Liz. Theres Gibbs in NCIS and Dr. Bailey in Greys Anatomy and Diane in The Good Wife and all the reality TV shows--Project Runway The Voice Top Chef--that endow their experts with some combination of barking authority/gentle guidance/guruhood.In general though those portrayals of mentorship when theyre to be found are presented primarily from the perspective of the mentee with audiences meant to identify with the struggles of the advised-to rather than of those who dispense the advice. And theyre up against all the other many many recent shows and movies from New Girl to The League to Youre the Worst to Drinking Buddies that carry on in the tradition of Friends and Girlfriends and How I Met Your Mother portrayals that celebrate the power of the friend group not just as a unit of social organization but as a unit of wisdom. Parents bosses mentors in general--theyre largely absent from these universes. Advice is exchanged horizontally.Theres a ""Magical Old Man"" quality to Ben who swoops into Juless life fixes her problems and dries her tears with his handkerchief.That general posture--the celebration of the peer-to-peer network--probably has something to do with the cultures longstanding fetishization of youth and the rise of Facebook and the rise of the Grups and the fact that some of the worlds most powerful companies are run by wunderkinder in hoodies and the hope that 60 is the new 40 and the reality that partly because of the webs flattening effect ""youth culture"" is increasingly simply culture. While it may not be the case as A.O. Scott argued last year that we are collectively witnessing the death throes of adulthood in that culture what may be truer is that age itself--the raw data of experience--has lost its place as a determining factor of cultural authority. We have found a way culturally to replicate the cruelty of the ice floe. The Intern bless its treacly heart rejects all that. It celebrates age as a value unto itself. (""Intern"" here is of course ironic as its the intern who ends up teaching the boss etc. etc.) Jules runs a successful business (an e-commerce startup). Shes capable and hard-working but she may be too young her investors think to run her business now that its a bona-fide company. And Ben for his part is looking for something to do after his retirement and the death of his wife. (""Dont get me wrong Im not unhappy"" Ben confides in a voiceover. ""I just know theres a hole in my life and I need to fill it."") Long story short(er) Things work out well for both of them.They both help each other get what they want and maybe even what they need.This is not the stuff to be sure of deep philosophy. The glib Benjamin Buttoning--Ben and Jules meet in the middle emotionally--is not subtle. There is as my colleague David pointed out a ""Magical Old Man"" quality to Ben who swoops into Juless life fixes her problems and dries her tears with his omnipresent handkerchief. (And theres the fact that hes a man with all the freight that brings.) The younguns here also come in for a drubbing Jules rides a bike through the companys converted-loft office space ridiculously and there are a lot of predictable jokes at the expense of both digital technology and the say-anything proclivities of the young. (""Im 24"" Juless assistant Becky tells Ben quickly adding ""I know its the job--it ages you. Which wont be great in your case."")And yet. You know who comes out looking great in all this? Ben. This is his film through and through. And theres something powerful in that in the simple fact that The Intern is so sympathetic to its older character--so resolutely on the side of a person who might in other contexts be dismissed or ignored or as is so often the case invisible. The Intern is in some sense the cinematic version of that Celine ad with Didion It celebrates age for the wisdom it brings along with it. Bens resistance to the complacencies that are so often ascribed to the elderly could double as a rallying cry for older people as a group. People who may be retired but who are not yet tired. People who will not go with the floe. ""I read somewhere that musicians dont retire"" Ben tells The Interns audience. ""They stop when theres no more music in them."" He pauses. ""Well I still have music.""

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Sep 25 2015 Culture In The Intern the businesswoman Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) and by extension the writer and director Nancy Meyers has a question Where did all the ""real men"" go? Jules mourns not for the bossy sexist fools of the Mad Men era but for grown-ups men who could rock a pocket square who had a handkerchief at the ready who had a good head on their shoulders and ambitions for existence. Into this vacuum walks Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) her new senior intern a magical old man blessed with the wisdom of his generation but none of the baggage ready to bring balance to her life.Related Story In Defense of the Chick Flick Its easy to scoff but The Intern is clearly a Nancy Meyers movie. Her previous films (Somethings Gotta Give Its Complicated) saw heroines bemoan the romantic appeal and destructive foolishness of alpha dogs played by Jack Nicholson and Alec Baldwin. The Intern tweaks this formula by making its central relationship platonic Its main character Ben is free of foibles and is a helpful fountain of paternalistic advice. Thanks largely to performances by De Niro and Hathaway The Intern is a gentle enjoyable fantasy--and certainly Meyerss best film in more than a decade.As befits a modern generation-gap comedy The Intern is set at a start-up a successful shopping website Jules founded called About the Fit thats colonized a converted factory in Red Hook Brooklyn. (As she has many other locales Meyers fetishizes the boroughs architecture giving it an almost artificial sheen.) Ben is a retired widower with plenty of time on his hands and a seemingly bottomless reserve of can-do spirit who applies to a senior internship program. Once hes assigned to Jules his inexhaustible patience with her mild Type-A personality makes them an unbeatable team as she weathers the bumps of expanding her company and balancing work and her personal life.The Interns stakes are appreciably low--theres a major set-piece revolving around an inappropriate email that Jules accidentally sends--but the challenges of running a company make for a good narrative spine to build around. Meyers often struggles to make her central premises remotely relatable--Its Complicated was about the expensive remodel of a Santa Barbara kitchen--but Ben is such a do-gooder that youre instantly rooting for him to win Juless favor. Once she accepts him as a person with valuable insight to contribute her life is suddenly besieged by a million tiny crises for him to solve.The Intern is a gentle enjoyable fantasy--and certainly Meyerss best film in more than a decade.Meyers has some fun with traditional fish-out-of-water humor Ben struggles to set up a Facebook account astonishes his fellow twenty-something interns by carrying a briefcase and dispenses chivalrous dating advice that basically amounts to ""maybe go easy on the texting."" But the pivotal piece of generational commentary comes when Jules gets drunk at a bar with her interns and starts bemoaning the arrested development of her generations men doofuses who have no concept of their career goals or even how to dress beyond business casual supposedly outstripped by her generation of women raised in the ""Take Your Daughter to Work Day"" era.Chief among these offenders is Juless househusband Matt (Anders Holm) for whom the film has a hilarious lack of respect compared to Ben. Jules is late to meetings and a bit of a micromanager but as start-up CEOs go shes pretty angelic Her major conflict is finding time to be at home with Matt and their precocious moppet Paige (JoJo Kushner). Ben is there to gently nudge Jules away from the idea that she should scale back her lifes work out of some societal ideal of womanhood. But as is often the case Meyers has her characters articulate each side of the debate a little too obviously then fashions an ending that tries to have it both ways.The Intern works however mostly because of the strength of its leads. De Niro hasnt played anyone this mild-mannered in years but hes cute and reserved in the right ways giving his trademark squinty nod-grins anytime theyre needed. Ben spends much of the first hour in a slightly melancholy mood hovering on the outside of Juless life just waiting to be given a purpose again but De Niro makes him sympathetic. Hathaway too takes Jules right up to the edge of being annoying over and over again then pulls back each time with just the right amount of self-awareness. The various chuckleheads who constitute the supporting cast (including Adam DeVine Zack Pearlman and Nat Wolff) function as easy but weak punchlines for how feckless their generation of men have become. But The Intern has a solution Two hours of concentrated Baby-Boomer wisdom and a drawer full of pocket squares it posits are all it takes to right even the most wayward path to adulthood.

Its set in the overlap of two generations of Brooklyn businesspeople. Jules (Anne Hathaway) has built an Internet start-up from zero to booming in eighteen months but the pace of her passionately hands-on management style is straining her marriage to Matt (Anders Holm) a stay-at-home dad.

Jules under pressure from investors to yield control of the company increasingly relies on the wise discreet and admiring volunteer who becomes a key presence in her business and her household alike.

Photo Francois Duhamel/ Warner Bros. Like a demographics whitepaper come to life Nancy Meyerss The Intern throws two of contemporary Americas biggest social forces against one another rapidly retiring boomers in the form of 70-year-old intern Robert De Niro and tech-savvy millennials in the form of his harried early-30s boss Anne Hathaway and her start-up filled with younguns. It opens with De Niro as Brooklyn widower Ben Whittaker explaining his situation in awkwardly simple voice-over Hes retired hes lonely hes been trying to fill his days with a myriad of activities and he feels its time for a change. ""I just know theres a hole in my life and I need to fill it."" Theres a reason hes being so painfully direct This is a Nancy Meyers film. But theres another reason too Were watching Bens application video for a senior intern program at a hot new fashion e-commerce site called About the Fit. Ben is plain methodical and simple. Jules Ostin (Hathaway) is quirky frantic and overworked. She started About the Fit in her Brooklyn kitchen and now has a couple hundred employees. Her day is stacked with meetings and she rides around the office on a bike to keep up. Shes not even sure that shes ever heard of this senior internship program because when Ben shows up for his first day of work Jules has absolutely zero idea what to do with him. (""Im not good with old people"" she protests.) But it turns out that these crazy kids with their untucked shirts and their Instagram accounts and their catchphrases (""Gray is the new green"" ""Sitting is the new smoking"") can learn a thing or two from this hardworking seemingly outdated mans man. Hes respectful he dresses in a tie he makes sure not to leave the office until the boss leaves and he basically does everything better than everybody else. Meanwhile they teach him about Facebook and fist-bumps. At her best Meyers captures the innate charm of her performers and creates milieus in which we like to spend time. (The two concepts are related We hear a lot about how nice the houses and kitchens in her films are but thats because she often fills them with characters we like.) At her worst her characterizations and plotting seem designed to prove a point rather than to tell a story. The Intern straddles both her weaknesses and her strengths. We spend much of the first half of the film watching Ben predictably prove himself the superior of the kids around him; hes chivalrous hes better organized hes observant and sympathetic and he knows Brooklyn way better than they do. But it mostly works because Meyers uses De Niro well. The actors later career is sick with anonymous paycheck gigs but here his natural reserve -- which in his greatest films reads as neurosis melancholy or submerged violence -- comes off as discretion and patience. We like the guy and that counts for a lot. For most of its running time The Intern gets off on De Niros amiability and Hathaways sweet energy She makes being busy and tired and ambitious and frantic seem kind of fun. The rub however is that shes got a family at home -- a stay-at-home-dad husband and an adorable young daughter -- and theyre feeling neglected. Meanwhile Juless investors are demanding that she hire a CEO which will reduce her workload but also put her under someone elses leadership. And so the film gradually becomes less about her relationship with Ben and more about her search for a new business partner and her uncertainty about whether she should even hire one and about how shes not spending enough time at home and about whether thats a condescending thing to say to a woman in the first place and about whether anyone would be so worried about her workload if she were a man and about ... well about a lot of things many of them in-artfully expressed. So The Intern degenerates into a series of monologues about ambition and relationships and having it all. As the speeches pile up our goodwill dissipates and so does the films magic.

"Review The bearable niceness of The Intern | The Big Story Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Review The bearable niceness of The Intern By LINDSEY BAHR Sep. 22 2015 513 PM EDT The world of Nancy Meyers sure is beautiful.But her studied production design and dreamy interiors have become such a focal point that theyve almost eclipsed her storytelling. It marginalizes what she does and how she has from ""The Parent Trap"" to ""Its Complicated"" created her own lovely and implausible cottage industry of movies that are for the most part exceedingly pleasant to watch.She tells stories about divorce affairs and later life loves using wit and humor that is somehow blue and sassy but also innocent. Meyers is one of the more retro writer-directors working today.""The Intern"" her first film in six years is a curious case melding together those modern retro sensibilities in a way that even further distances her work from reality. This is not a love story though. Its a workplace tale about a smiley unflappable 70-year-old retiree Ben (Robert De Niro) who goes to intern for the 30-something CEO of an online retail startup.With only the most polite issues peppering the plot its less a study of generational conflict and more of a series of loosely connected events about a guardian angel sent out of retirement to tell Anne Hathaway that she really can have it all.Bens adjustment to working with all these kids might be the hook but Jules Ostin (Hathaway) is the centerpiece and heart of the movie. In the past year and a half she has built an insanely successful clothing business from the ground up and is now juggling a kid her relationship with her stay-at-home husband and a board of directors who want to replace her with a more seasoned CEO.She has her quirks. but Jules is neither the prototypical cutesy clumsy comedy heroine nor the passionless executive who just needs to loosen up. In fact Jules isnt a type at all. Hathaway plays her as serious wise playful and insecure. Every time you think she might descend into caricature Hathaway pulls back and grounds Jules.Her unusually developed character has the somewhat adverse effect of exaggerating Bens one-note but charming simplicity. Ben spent his entire career at a factory that made phonebooks. He was married now hes widowed retired and bored of it. De Niro plays him as so nice and so cuddly that hes almost alien. He is the grandpa from ""Up"" without the edge here to tell millennial men to stop dressing like little boys to carry handkerchiefs because ladies cry to stay at work until the boss leaves and to talk to not text romantic prospects.Beyond a flirtation with the office masseuse (Rene Russo) Ben has nowhere to grow. Hes set in his perfectly PC retro-modern ways just there to help everyone -- especially Jules.Its an odd relationship with few actual revelations. Thats because theres no big conflict. Jules says she doesnt really like old people and at one point worries that Ben knows too much about her but those all dissolve without much ceremony.There are of course some other issues that Jules and Ben must deal with but even those are minor. Nothing is ever that wrong in the Meyers-verse. It might not be a life you recognize from reality but is the one that we fantasize about thanks to magazines and movies like this.It can be cloying at times but the disconnected timelessness of it all is all the more reason for Meyers to keep doing her own thing as long as she can. She doesnt speak to whats trendy in filmmaking. Aside from the technology ""The Intern"" could have just as easily existed in 1990.Still in keeping everything so polite ""The Intern"" while being a pleasant and watchable movie is also entirely ephemeral. Maybe thats why like Meyers other films ""The Intern"" will likely be so re-watchable too.""The Intern"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""some suggestive content and brief strong language.""

"Meyerss Lemons Robert De Niro Saves The Intern << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Meyerss Lemons Robert De Niro Saves The Intern Warner Bros. Movies September 25 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Its probable that in my unbridled disdain for the films of Nancy Meyers -- including What Women Want Somethings Gotta Give and Its Complicated -- I might have overlooked something. Meyers is a very good director of men Mel Gibson Jack Nicholson and Alec Baldwin respectively in those films. Baldwin has probably never been better in a movie than he is there. Charming his way past Meryl Streep as her slimy ex-husband hes like a caveman going as Cary Grant for Halloween. Meyerss skill in this department is important for two reasons. First the mans part in these movies -- romantic comedies nominal and otherwise -- began mattering less and less in the 2000s. You can put Matthew McConaughey opposite Jennifer Lopez or Gerard Butler with Hilary Swank Katherine Heigl or Jennifer Aniston. You never feel as if the male lead has a stake in the outcome. Hes just there. That of course leads to the second thing which also happens to be the reason for the unbridled disdain Men take over what are supposed to be womens movies. And I dont mean that Nicholson upstages Diane Keaton in Somethings Gotta Give (hes really good; shes better). I mean that Meyers always seems to think men are the solution to womens problems. She gives them prime placement because for the women in these movies theyre prime. Her new movie The Intern is another one of these but its also one of her most tolerable movies. She has altered the formula for one thing. Its a love story between the owner (Anne Hathaway) of a Brooklyn-based online shopping site and the 70-year-old widowed retiree (Robert De Niro) she has reluctantly let into her life -- but its a platonic one. And emotionally youre with him. Jules Ostin the woman Hathaway plays with zero static cling has a business problem (her investors think the company needs a CEO) thats giving her a marriage problem (shes there but not present) which gives her a Nancy Meyers problem (its all her fault). To the rescue comes De Niros Ben Whittaker. Ben used to be an executive in the phone book industry and comes to work in handsomely tailored suits. To the twentysomething kids -- played by Adam DeVine Zack Pearlman Peter Vack and Christina Scherer -- bopping around the office hes like a stegosaurus or someone from Sterling Cooper. Eww the phone book. But his gravitas turns their pity into respect. By the end of two scenes he practically owns the companys converted factory loft with sheer confidence. He asks out the receptive office masseuse (Rene Russo) but most of his energy goes into soothing Jules. First he cleans up a mess of clothes that had been driving her crazy. Then he tells her alcoholic driver to take a hike. He does child care for her cavity-inducing daughter and gradually begins streamlining the way things are done around the office boosting efficiency and Juless confidence. You built this company all by yourself he basically tells her. Why let some stranger take control? Theres not much here story-wise. But when Meyers wants to write an involving scene with characters thinking and feeling the way humans think and feel you want to applaud. There are four of these here and they all involve Ben. In the best one Meyers concocts a minor reveal about his former executive work life that moved me. Everything De Niro does here is perfect -- even when in the movies dumbest scene he commandeers a home break-in with the younger employees for Jules-related reasons that are so Nancy Meyers. In this later stage of his career hes been asked to lean on that ""Who farted?"" face that he makes. (To watch him is to assume those Fockers movies practically constitute a Dutch oven.) Meyers is the first director in years to send some perfume his way. The creases and lines on his face practically dance. De Niro has rarely been an actor you keep a camera on for a quiet comedic reaction shot but she never cuts away from him and he never disappoints rolling and darting his eyes turning his mouth down and up. These typically are called frowns and smiles but with De Niro youre in stranger expressive territory. The weather on his face can be impervious to meteorology. But Meyers gets a lot out of that sourpuss. He was almost as wonderful in that 2009 remake of Italys Everybodys Fine but the movie itself was cheap and gimmicky and thought that holiday sweaters would be funny on him. Whats funny about him here is also whats touching about the part the pride he takes in this job. Theres a sight gag for instance in which the camera holds a close-up of the two alarm clocks Ben sets every night as they ring then pulls out to show him turn them off fully dressed. Meyers appears to adore De Niro the way she does Gibson Nicholson and Baldwin. He makes less appalling her preoccupation with whats wrong with women at work. With a lot of the movies shes written (Private Benjamin Baby Boom) or writes and directs shes thinking about the cost of having a career. The problem with Meyers is that you can usually see the price tags. It would have been nice to hear the women at Juless company talk about their lives. Celia Weston plays another intern but like every woman here who isnt Jules the character turns out to be a dingbat. This time the stress seems to stem from Juless relative youth. Maybe shes gotten too much too soon. Jules could be Hathaways magazine assistant from The Devil Wears Prada but with no overbearing mentor to call. Even Juless scientist mother (the judgmentally indifferent Mary Kay Place) calls with insults disguised as professional advice. Meanwhile Linda Lavin is on hand as someone Ben once dated to be aggressive and bitter toward him. Shes funny -- and this type of nice-then-nasty woman exists. But under these circumstances the ways Meyers drops the house on her feels cruel. Perhaps sensing that she has stacked the deck against another successful female Meyers spends a lot of time having women point out how there are no more real men either. Its a complaint that Meyers puts a lot of old-fashioned weight behind the way her former compatriot in gender codes Nora Ephron used to. Meyers has picked up on the shifting gender norms and her reaction isnt completely alarmist. Theyve aroused her curiosity more than her condescension. Ben is a man -- the only man. But during an important business trip to San Francisco he and Jules sit on a bed in her hotel room in robes with tea as she has a meltdown about her future. What if she gets a divorce from her stay-at-home husband (Anders Holm)? What if she never remarries? What if she dies alone? Ben sensibly sensitively but sternly removes her head from the oven. She falls asleep. He cries watching Singin in the Rain. A different movie would have him as Harry to her Sally. Meyers is all too happy to take them in a different direction to Girls. This column originally identified the movie to which De Niros character cries as An American in Paris; it was Singin in the Rain. We regret the error.

"The Intern with Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway directed by Nancy Meyers reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Gender Politics of The Intern Arent Nearly As Bad As the Trailers Suggest The Gender Politics of The Intern Arent Nearly As Bad As the Trailers Suggest Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 25 2015 909 AM The Intern The gender politics of this Nancy Meyers comedy arent nearly as bad as the trailers suggest. By L.V. Anderson Left to right Christina Scherer as Becky Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker and Anne Hathaway as Jules Ostin in The Intern. Photo courtesy Francois Duhamel/Warner Bros I admit that the marketing of The Intern made me want to wrap several cashmere sweaters around my head and hide away in a multimillion-dollar brownstone until the movie disappeared from theaters. The two trailers convinced me that this Nancy Meyers movie about a wealthy 70-year-old retiree who in the least plausible premise of the year takes a job as an intern for a thirtysomething female startup founder would be the cinematic equivalent of a garbage truck hurtling into a tanker of high-fructose corn syrup. The previews showed ""Mr. Congeniality"" Ben (Robert De Niro) hitting it off with his new co-workers while ice queen Jules (Anne Hathaway) ignores underlings and bristles at criticism. The films tagline--""Experience never gets old""--created the impression that the plot would have Ben swooping in to rescue Jules from her own incompetence and ignorance by providing the kind of business expertise that only old white men in suits possess. Reader ignore the tone-deaf marketing campaign. The Intern is far more charming and far savvier about gender politics than the trailers led me to believe. That doesnt mean its a great film by any means nor does it honestly grapple with the questions about work-life balance that its characters are always having heart-to-hearts about. But nobody does visually pleasing occasionally funny escapist entertainment about goodhearted rich people trying their best to do the right thing better than Nancy Meyers. Advertisement The Intern doesnt have a plot so much as plots--its screenplay also by Meyers is a series of vignettes that would feel right at home on an ABC Family dramedy. We first meet Ben Whittaker a retired executive whos filled his days learning yoga gardening and Mandarin since his wife died but misses the structure provided by work. When he sees a flier outside a Park Slope grocery store advertising a senior internship program at an online apparel store called About the Fit he asks his 9-year-old grandson how to use a USB connector records a video resume and sends it in. A mild-mannered chivalrous go-getter with business experience Ben naturally gets the job (along with a handful of other senior citizens who are shown once and then disappear). About the Fit we learn has grown to 200 employees since it was founded by Jules Ostin 18 months ago; were told the company is experiencing growing pains but it sure doesnt look that way. The office space a light-filled former factory is furnished with rows of attractive well-dressed young people diligently examining fashion photos writing code and answering customer service calls. When something good happens--like the company getting an unprecedented 2500 likes on an Instagram post--someone rings a bell and everyone applauds. Theres a sexy massage therapist named Fiona (Rene Russo) on staff to make sure no one gets too stressed-out. Jules often rides her bicycle from one end of the loft to the other to save time but no one yells snorts Adderall or neglects his personal hygiene even though they constantly talk about how sleep-deprived they are. About the Fit is an art directors wet dream of a tech startup. Jules whos assigned to supervise Ben is initially wary and considers having him transferred to another department but she soon comes to view him as indispensable. Bens cool head and old-school approach to life come in handy in a series of very low-stakes conflicts. Co-worker Jason (Workaholics Adam DeVine) accidentally slept with the roommate of the girl he likes; Ben persuades him to apologize to her in person instead of via text and email. Ben notices Jules driver acting reckless defuses the situation and becomes her new chauffeur. Jules accidentally sends an email about how awful her mom is to her mom instead of her husband; Ben and his new work friends embark on a (genuinely funny) caper to delete the email from Jules moms computer before she sees it. Scenes in which Ben teaches the youngsters how to use a handkerchief where to get a good briefcase and why to tuck in their shirts risk romanticizing the era in which men were men--and indeed Jules goes off on a brief drunken rant about how her generation of men act like immature boys--but its hard to take the movies nostalgia too seriously. After all the immature boys who work at About the Fit are total mensches even though they wear T-shirts and play video games. The Interns central conflict which simmers on the back burner for most of the movie doesnt really have much to do with Ben Its Jules dilemma. According to her colleague Cameron (an underutilized Andrew Rannells whose character is never fully explained) the venture capitalists who backed About the Fit want Jules to consider bringing in an outside CEO to help the company grow and prevent Jules and everyone else from flaming out. Jules who lives and breathes About the Fit--taking customer service calls fine-tuning the sites homepage visiting the warehouse to make sure the clothes are folded beautifully before theyre shipped--doesnt love the idea but promises to meet with a few candidates. She wants to do right not only by her investors and her employees but also by her family whom we meet halfway through the movie. Jules husband Matt (Workaholics Anders Holm--who knew Nancy Meyers was such a Workaholics fan?) gave up his high-powered job to take care of their daughter and Jules hopes that taking on a new CEO at work--even if that means relinquishing control of the company she built--will make it easier for her to spend time with her family. Ben who grows closer and closer to Jules and her family throughout the film plays a supporting role as Jules tries to figure out if she can keep running her company and have the home life she wants. And Bens old-fashioned philosophy does not extend to Jules family life He emphatically supports Jules right to Have It All. His role isnt really that of a business mentor at all--sure he knows how to read marketing reports but hes helpful to Jules primarily as a sounding board and as a ""you go girl"" cheerleader. If your personal fantasy has always been to see Robert De Niro say things like ""I hate to be the feminist here but you should be able to have a huge career and be who you are"" Ive got good news. Theres something about De Niros character--maybe the fact that he always says the right thing embodies all the best traits of his generation and yet holds all the correct beliefs about women in the workplace--that feels a little half-baked. Consider Ben a variation on the Magical Negro. Like most of Meyers movies The Intern is too blindingly Caucasian to feature a black character who helps the white protagonist figure her life out. Instead Ben is a Magical Senior who exists fundamentally to help Jules learn whats important in life. De Niro doesnt seem to quite know what to do with Bens utter lack of negative qualities--you get the impression that Ben is withholding something that theres something whirring behind his kind eyes but that might just be what happens when you ask a highly intelligent actor to play a two-dimensional role. Hathaway on the other hand is pretty much perfect as Jules. The actress of course gets a lot of flak for seeming too thirsty--for appearing to care too much about acting. But thats exactly whats needed for a character like Jules who is highly driven polished and perfectionistic. Theres a scene late in the film in which Jules invites Ben into her hotel room to talk about whats weighing on her and an anxiety Id developed based on a shot of a lingering hug in the trailer returned. But the scene turned into a showcase of Jules emotional vulnerability which Hathaway plays just right Shes hurting so much that it doesnt even occur to her (the way it does to Ben) that the situation might read as sexual. No one could accuse Meyers of realism--The Intern like her other movies is a modern-day fairy tale set inside a Pottery Barn catalog--but shes smarter about sex and about gender than most comedy filmmakers. This deliberately uncomfortable moment highlights the fact that audiences--and people in general--still dont quite know what to make of platonic friendships between men and women especially older men and younger women. Neither apparently does The Interns marketing team. SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

The comedy stars Robert De Niro as a retiree with too much time on his hands. So he signs up for an internet companys ""senior intern"" program which puts older people to work at the same slave wages (or non-wages) as recent college grads. To her credit filmmaker Nancy Meyers only makes the minimum amount of jokes about old people not knowing how to handle tech. Also to the movies credit the film co-stars Anne Hathaway as the companys founder a very bright woman with a stay-at-home husband and the calmly held belief (which is also Meyers) that theres absolutely nothing wrong with that.Good for both of them. But eventually it becomes clear that De Niro isnt playing a character. Hes playing a symbol an old-fashioned fellow whos there to teach all the wimpy millennial guys what a real man is supposed to be providing lessons in dating deportment and haberdashery. Also becoming a stand-in dad for Hathaways character giving her straight-talk advice on her marriage providing common-sense guidance on her business warning her when she drinks too much and getting her out of at least one embarrassing personal scrape. You see Meyers real point is that while women like Hathaways character have taken on new responsibility and maturity the men their age have regressed into perpetual boyhoodie high-fiving dudes and playing Minecraft. Bring back old-fashioned gentlemen Meyers cries. I agree. Except the film doesnt really portray Hathaways character as that much more mature than the bros around her - shes flighty disorganized given to public tears. And De Niros character never becomes a real character - he remains a two-dimensional role model a cardboard cutout without sharp edges or dark shadows. (Oh and interestingly even purportedly progressive Meyers accepts the usual Hollywood ageism - while De Niro 72 shrinks in comic horror from fellow septuagenarian Linda Lavin hes allowed to have blissfully sexy and uncomplicated dates with Rene Russo 61.) This is perhaps investing a Meyers comedy with too much weight; traditionally her pictures are made to give aging stars (and audiences) a bit of romance and a few laughs with lots of scenes in places where every kitchen has a Viking stove and every neighborhood is white and upper-class. But the romance here is limited and the laughs are few. (A supposedly ""hysterical"" comedy scene in the middle falls flat.) Hathaway tries very hard; shes always had incredibly easy access to her emotions and she has a tearful scene with De Niro thats remarkably real and in the moment. And De Niro is clearly enjoying playing an uncomplicated good guy for a change the nonjudgmental father figure always there to lend a hand or a handout. But while he doesnt lecture people - too much - you get the feeling that Meyers is even if the words arent clear. If millennial men are the problem (and its arguable that theyre any less mature than a lot of the millennial women surrounding them) then whats her solution? Play some Sinatra? Sport a pocket square? Listen to Dad? ""The Intern"" may look as nice and sweet as a slice of cake. But in the end it leaves a slightly bad taste in your mouth. Ratings note The film contains some strong language alcohol abuse and sexual situations. The Intern (PG-13) Warner Bros. (121 min.) Directed by Nancy Meyers. With Robert De Niro Anne Hathaway.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 25 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 25 2015 102AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Nancy Meyers Written by Nancy Meyers Starring Robert De Niro Anne Hathaway Country USA Language English Perhaps The Intern is not the right occasion to condemn Robert De Niros late career choices yet again. Presumably the veteran dramatic actor has a few true friends who can whisper the word ""legacy"" in his ear in more kindly tones than the critics ever do. His response to that judgment is surely evident in his decision to play the part of a 70-year-old retiree who takes an internship with an online fashion retailer because he is bored stiff. Some people just have to keep working. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega star in Star Wars The Force Awakens which comes out Dec. 18. Fall Film Preview Whats on offer this fall on the big screen Festival co-founder Robert De Niro was joined by fellow actors Harvey Keitel Nick Sandow and Theo Rossi at the Vanity Fair party kicking off the Tribeca Film Festival. (April 15) AP Video Video Video Robert De Niro and friends kick off Tribeca Film Festival No better to judge The Intern for its own ambitions as a social comedy about generational anxieties in the workplace. As such its only mildly entertaining never funny enough nor smart enough to summarize the cultural moment in the manner of a Working Girl or The Social Network. Written and directed by Nancy Meyers its formulaic script uneven dialogue and sentimentality place it right alongside her last effort Its Complicated as a movie that doesnt do justice to an invigorating premise.Widower Ben Whittaker - thats a gentle button-downed De Niro - finds retirement so empty he applies for a job with an online fashion business founded by the workaholic Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway.) Shes an overtaxed and demanding boss with her hand in every aspect of an explosively successful company but she did not sign on to this hip idea of hiring seniors as interns and is highly skeptical when Ben is assigned to assist her.And so Meyers leads us down a wide and clearly signposted road with more-or-less amusing jokes about the generational differences enlivening the story of Juless inevitable change of heart about Ben. Formerly an executive with a phone-book company that just happened to operate out of the same Brooklyn warehouse Ben is a class act wise tactful and hard-working. Pretty soon hes acting as Juless secretary chauffeur business adviser butler babysitter and even marriage counsellor.There are some smart things in Meyerss script Ben begins a romance with the office massage therapist (Rene Russo) thereby removing any yuck factor from his growing friendship with his much younger female boss. And there are many dumb things That romance is ignited by two scenes featuring tired sexual gags.Some of the witticisms about seniors computer literacy or millennials office manners are clever enough but the larger comedy never gathers much speed. Indeed the movie almost winds up in a ditch when Ben and some young colleagues go off on a caper breaking into a house to retrieve a wayward e-mail and abandoning the films key relationship at the curb.The real weakness in the relationship is that neither Ben nor Jules is characterized deeply enough to give the actors the material they need. De Niro is a good comedian if not a great one but Ben is portrayed as so unfailingly sunny and helpful that the gentlemanly act begins to tire before the film is half-over.Meanwhile the supposedly abrasive Jules warms to Bens charms after only one minor roadblock. If Meyers isnt going to give Hathaways character any room to play screwball - the comic energy that has fuelled workplace movies since Hollywoods golden age and that Hathaway herself provided back when she was playing the intern in The Devil Wears Prada - at least the actress should be offered more space to try out her best obnoxious.In later scenes Meyer includes her most interesting reflections about professionally successful women and both Hathaway and De Niro do some nice work here deftly handling the increasing (but perfectly chaste) intimacy between their characters. On the other hand despite Anders Holms best efforts as Juless husband Matt the dialogue in that couples final scenes is cringe-inducing.The Intern might have a few things to say about work but mainly its the kind of comedy you can rent some Saturday night secure in the knowledge that if you fall asleep in the third act a more alert friend can summarize its conclusions in a matter of seconds.

A 70-year-old retired widower (Robert De Niro) signs on as an intern for a fast-rising online fashion retail site run by a hard-driving young entrepreneur (Anne Hathaway). Eventually they become besties and she incorporates his wisdom into her personal and business life.But Meyers -- the auteur behind ""Somethings Gotta Give"" and ""Its Complicated"" among many others -- manages to deal with some major issues while doling out comfortable comedic scenes and heartwarming assurances.First off she squarely faces the potential abyss of retirement thats currently confronting tens of millions of Americans the possible sense of empty uselessness the loss of purpose and function.Next she deals with the work/domestic life balance that modern women have to juggle the struggle not to lean too far in one direction or another how to be successful mom and wife and businesswoman.Then just to stir the pot a bit more Meyers offers much commentary on the pitfalls of a post-feminist world in which masculinity has devolved into bro-ness video games and constant casual wear as men try to figure out just how theyre supposed to act. She goes a bit too far here -- men are supposed to carry handkerchiefs so they can lend them to the weeping women they will inevitably encounter -- but its still a valid issue.Which makes for quite a bit going on beneath what on the surface appears to be a light-hearted feel-good piece of piffle.De Niro plays Ben Whittaker a retired business executive whos done the traveling and visited the grandkids a few times too many and is now thoroughly bored in his Brooklyn home. One day he hears about a firm that wants to take on seniors as interns. He applies hes accepted.Hes immediately taken aback by the open-floor casual-appearing but still buzzing culture of the online fashion firm whose founder and CEO Jules Ostin (Hathaway) rides a bicycle from one end of the office to the other to get to appointments on time. Ben finds himself assigned directly to Jules who as youd expect initially avoids him.But he doggedly hangs in there becoming friends with some of the young hipsters toiling away. And when it turns out Jules needs a driver one day Ben gets behind the wheel. Eventually despite some hiccups they bond and Ben ends up meeting Jules stay-at-home-dad husband Matt (Anders Holm) and daughter Paige (JoJo Kushner).Ben being the wise man figure here ends up advising Jules on her big business dilemma Should she hire a CEO to run the company so she can spend more time with her family. And he ends up advising her on more intimate issues as well.This being a Nancy Meyers film Ben also needs some hint of romance so here comes Rene Russo as the companys full-time masseuse. Suddenly work as a senior intern looks a whole lot better.Along the way there are escapades and punch lines teary moments and goofy turns. It is indeed a formulaic comedy. But in between the comic and sentimental bits there are some actual thoughts and real-life situations enough to certainly give pause before the easy laughs take over. ""The Intern"" may be predictable but its far from empty.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongThe InternGRADE BRated PG-13 for some suggestive content and brief strong languageRunning time 121 minutesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1Fk7J3S MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/09/25/review-intern-formulaic-comedy-lot-mind/72775016/,200,theintern10,theintern,detroitnews

Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway in ""The Intern."" Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway in ""The Intern."" (Francois Duhamel / Warner Bros.) Mark OlsenContact Reporter With her cashmere-soft touch eye for design ear for dialogue and heartfelt explorations of the ever-shifting dynamics between men and women writer-director-producer Nancy Meyers makes movies that are both commercial and idiosyncratically personal. Her new film ""The Intern"" is every inch a Nancy Meyers film for better and for worse.As one of the most successful female filmmakers in Hollywood Meyers makes movies as aggressively and unmistakably hers as more obvious counterparts such as Michael Mann. Meyers straddles a line between the fizzy fantasies of classical Hollywood and the emotional realities of modern life. This becomes the motivating tension in her movies as their stories exist between the lives her characters envision and the ones they actually live. Hence the aspirational kitchens.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; In ""The Intern"" Anne Hathaway is Jules Ostin founder of an online clothing retailer that has become successful quickly something of a mix of Nasty Gal and Net-A-Porter. She rides a bicycle around the sprawling industrial-chic open-plan office in Brooklyns Red Hook and amid its growing workforce desperately trying to stay on top of things.

Though Jules is at first reluctant to engage with him soon enough he becomes an indispensable aide-de-camp confidant and friend. Jules faces new challenges both at home with her husband Matt (Anders Holm) and at the office because her investors are pressuring her to bring in an experienced CEO. Anne Hathaway Nancy Meyers say The Intern evolved from Baby Boom Rebecca Keegan Nancy Meyers wrote and directed ""The Intern"" a comedy opening Sept. 25 in which Anne Hathaway plays Jules the young founder of a thriving Internet startup who hires a 70-year-old intern played by Robert De Niro. Meyers who also wrote and directed the movies ""Its Complicated"" and ""Somethings... Nancy Meyers wrote and directed ""The Intern"" a comedy opening Sept. 25 in which Anne Hathaway plays Jules the young founder of a thriving Internet startup who hires a 70-year-old intern played by Robert De Niro. Meyers who also wrote and directed the movies ""Its Complicated"" and ""Somethings... (Rebecca Keegan) Meyers earlier films ""Somethings Gotta Give"" with Diane Keaton and ""Its Complicated"" with Meryl Streep found Meyers dealing with issues of female characters more or less her own age and dealing with issues of aging and post-kids post-divorce life. Her new film pulses with a more purposefully current sort of energy. For example the music in a quick scene-setting montage in ""Its Complicated"" featured a boomer chestnut by Crosby Stills and Nash while a similar moment in ""The Intern"" uses a recent hit by Kendrick Lamar.The smartest idea in the movie is that that the relationship between Jules and Ben never goes anywhere near being romantic. The second-smartest idea is that De Niros character used to work for a company that printed phone books the very notion of which bewilders his young colleagues at a tech-era start-up giving the film the feeling of one generation checking in with another. Unfortunately Meyers adds one more layer to that idea which pushes it too far into movie-land coincidence and cliche. The film isnt concerned with the real spatial geography of Brooklyn or the distinctive characteristics of its many neighborhoods. Hathaways character lives in a cloistered world where a car service car whisks her to and from a multi-story brownstone every day. How De Niros character gets to and from the office whether by walking bus or subway is never shown.The 1987 film ""Baby Boom"" co-written by Meyers with then-husband Charles Shyer was explicitly concerned with the notion of ""having it all"" whether a woman could have a family and a career. In ""The Intern"" the focus is on the contemporary iteration of life-work balance -- whether the relentless competitive demands of the digital-age work environment can leave room for anything else.De Niro brings a fresh relaxed lightness to his performance tinged with the gruff charm of Spencer Tracy. Many of the best moments in the film involve placing Ben in relief to the younger male employees who become his de facto charges as they learn the wonders of a briefcase the power of tucking in a shirt or the importance of taking responsibility for their sloppy cluelessness.Meyers cheats a bit in making Ben already evolved as a self-described feminist in his thinking regarding women in power in the workplace and as breadwinners at home. Jules bemoans the way in which men now dress and act like boys -- and Meyers seems to be pointing a finger at post-Apatow depictions of men in the movies -- by holding up Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford as pinnacles of manliness but without full reflection as to the conflict those same ideals can create. (Ford for example is on his third marriage to a woman more than 20 his junior.)At one point De Niro gets emotional watching Gene Kelly sing ""You Were Meant for Me"" to Debbie Reynolds in ""Singin in the Rain"" a nod to both the classical Hollywood that Meyers looks to update and more straightforward notions of romance.As Ben becomes increasingly involved in supporting Jules in her decisions the film inadvertently pushes against a line where paternal becomes patronizing. In examining Jules difficulties in being an ever-chipper unstoppable overachiever -- including a late-night crying jag with puffy eyes and splotchy skin -- the movie seems to be addressing ""the Hathahaters"" those who turned against Hathaway for somehow being too together all the time.A comedic midmovie sequence involving a mini-heist by Ben and his boys feels like it belongs in some other movie and causes the film to temporarily lose focus. Overall the film feels scattered an assortment of scenes and ideas that mostly represent a notebook full of thoughts from Nancy Meyers.Thankfully that still makes for a better funnier and more considered movie than much of what passes for nonfranchise studio filmmaking even as it shows a world almost exclusively white straight and upmarket. With ""The Intern"" Meyers has made another bright contemporary American comedy with a lot on its mind -- and works hard to make it look effortless.mark.olsenlatimes.comTwitter IndieFocus------------The InternRunning time 2 hours 1 minuteRating PG-13 for some suggestive content and brief strong languagePlaying In wide release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Entertainment Movies Robert De Niro Anne Hathaway Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-the-intern-review-20150925-story.html#navtype=outfit,200,theintern11,theintern,latimes
"Intern The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; intern-the ) Intern The (United States 2015) September 24 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli If The Intern had confined itself to the unlikely relationship that develops between thirtysomething entrepreneur Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) and seventy-year old retiree Ben Whittaker (Robert DeNiro) it might have worked. Unfortunately writer/director Nancy Meyers has bogged down the narrative with questionable scenes tangents and subplots that take the focus off the April/October friendship and drag the running time out to an unacceptably long two hours. Retirement means different things to different people. For some its an opportunity to unwind and relax after a lifetime of work. Many people enjoy living a life of leisure where demands on their time are few and far between. For others its a roadway to boredom. They may not have loved their jobs but now they have far too many hours to fill and the monotony of not doing anything meaningful becomes oppressive.  Ben is a card-carrying member of the latter category. A retired widower he finds himself marking time until the end - existing rather than living. An opportunity to do something arrives in the form of an advertisement for ""Senior Interns."" A growing online fashion site wants to give back to the community by hiring a few over-65s and Ben goes after the position with relish. After being hired he is assigned as the personal assistant to Jules who runs the company. Jules however doesnt relate well to ""old people"" and things start out strained. After a while however Bens disarming parental approach breaks down her barriers and the two become close. The Intern is a romantic comedy without the romance. Meyers goes into overdrive ensuring theres not a whiff of sexual tension between Ben and Jules. Is it artificial?  Perhaps but Meyers is compensating for Hollywoods long tradition of pairing aging leading men with much younger women. Theres a counter-argument to this however. Romantic or quasi-romantic companionship doesnt demand sexual frisson - consider the sublime way in which Lost in Translation handled it. A more mature approach might have acknowledged the possibility of attraction without requiring either party to act on it. As it is Hathaway and DeNiro develop an appealing platonic dynamic. They mesh well together which makes it a shame that the movie takes so many extraneous detours. Some attempts to add depth to the characters dont work. A romance between DeNiro and a masseuse played by Rene Russo is so underdeveloped as to be pointless. On the other hand too much time is spent on Anne Hathaways marital woes - a little exposure to these would have gone a long way. Theres also a bizarre interlude in which Ben and his fellow interns become involved in a heist. This comedic segment feels like an outtake from a Woody Allen movie and although amusing as a stand-alone skit its out-of-place in the larger scheme. Finally theres an instance of foreshadowing that is (thankfully) ignored. Like too many aspects of The Intern its orphaned. Its hard to determine whether the final cut underwent significant tinkering post production or whether the screenplay was never properly vetted before filming began. Meyers is known for witty screenplays that emphasize the female perspective. Her best known films are the Diane Keaton/Jack Nicholson romance Somethings Gotta Give and the Meryl Streep/Steve Martin/Alec Baldwin triangle Its Complicated. Both are lighthearted enjoyable romps - funny enough not to be taken too seriously but with a hint of insight. In between however she was responsible for the messy The Holiday a rambling bloated production that resembles The Intern closely in tone and temperament. Without question DeNiro and Hathaway elevate the material. Theyre Oscar-winning professionals and their acting is on display. They make us care about unevenly written characters. In terms of comedic and dramatic content The Intern is hit-and-miss. Notions about ageism and corporate prejudice against female CEOs are grazed but not explored in a meaningful or compelling way. In the end the only thing that keeps us from walking out is that we like Ben and Jules especially when theyre together. Had The Intern been better focused and a good bit shorter that might have been enough.

Photo Credit AP / Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A senior citizen takes a job at a youthful online fashion company. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE De Niro and Hathaways charms plus a sparkling script make for feel-good fluff. CAST Robert De Niro Anne Hathaway Rene Russo LENGTH 201 ""The Intern"" stars Anne Hathaway as the young CEO of a successful online fashion business and Robert De Niro as a 70-year-old who becomes her unlikely intern. Its a premise that in Hollywood can result in only one of two movies. In the first movie tech-savvy bossypants Jules Ostin (Hathaway) will learn the value of the old ways from De Niros gentlemanly Ben Whittaker. He in turn will learn to engage with a newfangled fast-moving world. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? In the other movie the two fall in love. Thank heavens ""The Intern"" isnt the second movie though given the average age difference between male and female romantic leads it wouldnt be a huge surprise. (See any film by Woody Allen.) The thing is ""The Intern"" isnt the first movie either. A generation-gap comedy in which age turns out to be relatively unimportant -- and in which almost nothing important happens -- ""The Intern"" is a pleasant fluffy mess of a movie that succeeds only thanks to the charm of its two leads and the enduring skills of writer-director Nancy Meyers. Few filmmakers can do contemporary comedy -- whatever the era -- like Meyers whose credits include ""Baby Boom"" and ""Somethings Gotta Give."" Here she approaches modern-day Brooklyn where the film was largely shot and neatly captures its blend of fading oldsters youthful hipsters and newly minted 1-percenters. Jules works in gritty Red Hook but lives in tony Park Slope with her daughter Paige (JoJo Kushner) and stay-at-home husband Matt (Anders Holm). Into her hectic life comes Ben whose observational skills initially unnerve her (whatever hes thinking she suspects hes right) but whose grandfatherly aura and 40-year business acumen become vital to her personal and professional well-being. 232 MoviesThe Intern trailer Thats all fine -- and thats really all there is. Ben falls for the office masseuse (Rene Russo) and makes friends with some young dudes (Adam DeVine Zack Pearlman Jason Orley) while Jules finds some answers that didnt necessarily require an older mans wisdom. Still Meyers light touch and sparkling dialogue plus the lovely chemistry between her two stars make it all enjoyable. Look for Linda Lavin in a small part as Bens lovestruck neighbor. advertisement | advertise on newsday ----- ROMANTIC OR NOT FOUR SCREEN TEAMS ""The Intern"" features the unlikely pairing of Robert De Niro 72 with the much younger Anne Hathaway 33. (Relax theyre not romantically involved.) May-December pairings are nothing unusual in the movies. Just look at these four screen teams. Movies29 big movies in theaters this fall SABRINA (1954) -- Audrey Hepburn often was teamed with much older male co-stars though never more charmingly than in this frothy Billy Wilder comedy that had the 25-year-old gamin falling for a millionaire played by 55-year-old Humphrey Bogart. Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff VERTIGO (1958) -- James Stewart was 50 and Kim Novak was 25 but they generated so much electricity in this Hitchcock thriller that they were reteamed later that year for the bewitching ""Bell Book and Candle."" THE ROMAN SPRING OF MRS. STONE (1961) -- Its not always the man whos older. Here 48-year-old Vivien Leigh found herself falling for a man exactly half her age -- Warren Beatty as an Italian () Lothario. AS GOOD AS IT GETS (1997) -- Helen Hunt 34 and Jack Nicholson 60 sparred as if they were an old married couple in James L. Brooks comedy that earned both stars Oscars. --Daniel Bubbeo Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

VPCRobert De Niro and Anne Hathaway star in The Intern.(Photo Francois Duhamel)Were a long way from the days of Taxi Driver.Writer/director Nancy Meyers latest dramedy The Intern ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) posits a left-field concept -- a senior citizen being hired as an intern for an e-commerce fashion company -- and spirals out of control from there only keeping somewhat on the tracks thanks to the A-list acting talent involved. Robert De Niro entering office space to the tune of All About That Bass is legitimately the most absurd thing hes done on film in forever -- at least since asking about milking a cat in Meet the Parents -- yet it also happens to be the most realistic scene of the relentlessly fluffy Intern.Bored after traveling the world and feeling a hole in his life that morning yoga sessions just wont fill 70-year-old retired widower Ben Whittaker (De Niro) decides to take a flyer on working at About the Fit a hip new startup that for some reason never really explained has decided to have more aging interns than Millennial ones.USA TODAY5 times we loved Anne Hathaway before The InternHe blows in like Manly Poppins vintage briefcase in tow to teach young guys how to be less schlubby and more worthy of their Y chromosome while also being assigned to assist the companys CEO Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). Flighty and ambitious the young overworked mom makes time to ride her bicycle through the office yet tends to not sleep or eat. Her company is growing too fast says her nondescript second-in-command (Andrew Rannells) so they may need to bring in outside help to run the business the right way.Therein lies pretty much the only conflict in the movie as wise old Ben steps up and gets over the hump in her professional and personal lives. The Intern is about as edgy as a pillow fight in the Macys bedding department and the closest this thing gets to an actual villain are judgy stay-at-home moms.A master of the highfalutin rom-com (What Women Want Somethings Gotta Give) Meyers finds the right chemistry between Ben and Jules and her streak of excellent sets continues -- the spacious Brooklyn digs of About the Fit should be the envy of Googlers and Facebookers alike.USA TODAYGuess where Anne Hathaway interned to prep for Prada?But the story isnt even contrived its ridiculous. Ben is a super-intern who does nothing wrong and goes out of his way to be a help -- and is universally beloved by officemates too? Probably not. And Ben is warned that Jules is high maintenance to the max so she should be hell on heels. Shes not really that bad a boss though (other than being a little persnickety when it comes to her drivers). Because whens the last time Jeff Bezos answered the Amazon customer-service line for fun? Its most likely been a while.Hathaway nails Jules multiple quirks and The Intern is best when its just her and De Niro connecting -- theres a welcome energy in their May/December dynamic as she advises him on his social-media skills and he looks out for her hunger pangs. And the iconic actor also does well opposite all the young dudes in the office (from Adam DeVines office suavemeister to Zack Pearlman as Bens clingy colleague) as Ben drops knowledge regularly about the importance of handkerchiefs and a good suit.What will make longtime De Niro fans cringe is him spending an endless 30 seconds excessively blinking his eyes or Bens silent vocabulary of expressions he uses to communicate with Jules including a ""You go girl"" look and a ""You so crazy"" smirk. Even she gets tired of it at one point.For someone of De Niros reputation this Intern gig is a thankless job. 55 CONNECTTWEET 7 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1KxYImX",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/09/24/intern-movie-review/72670276/,200,theintern14,theintern,usatoday

Photo Warner Bros. MOVIE REVIEW The Intern Running time 121 minutes. Rated PG-13 (language). Nancy Meyers is known for her obsession with kitchens -- sun-drenched timelessly chic architectural marvels that provide a safe haven for all the directors characters. ""The Intern"" puts a new spin on this trope Robert De Niro is the kitchen. Devoid of nuance and complexity he plays Ben senior-citizen intern at a millennial startup who is good and solid and true. These are admirable qualities in a person; they are also tedious when not spiced up with human frailty. Anne Hathaway as founder of the company is an equally limited collection of traits Her Jules is also good and true though not so solid because shes young and overburdened and trying to Have It All. Anne HathawayPhoto Warner Bros. At the Brooklyn loft space that houses her clothing business she sails from one meeting to another on an old-fashioned bicycle wearing lots of white (another Meyers staple despite her characters quaffing coffee and red wine) and a vaguely overwhelmed expression. At home she exchanges brief hellos and goodbyes with her precocious daughter (JoJo Kushner) and chafing stay-at-home husband (Anders Holm) before diving back into work. Her companys ""senior intern program"" initiated by Jules adviser (Andrew Rannells whose charm goes largely unused here) is something of which this workaholic boss initially wants no part. But when Ben turns out to be more deft at business -- and life -- than most of her own age group she smartly warms to his presence. Likable as an ode to the benefits of intergenerational friendship ""The Intern"" is on less sure footing when it comes to gender politics. Meyers seems to be channeling some of her own frustrations when Jules storms out of a meeting with a potential CEO ""He called us a chick site and I couldnt hear anything after that"" she rants. Robert De Niro and Anne HathawayPhoto Warner Bros. But though Jules resists her advisers suggestion that she bring on a male corporate manager she gives an impassioned drunken speech about how there are no ""real men"" anymore; considers relinquishing professional control to save her marriage; and ultimately learns to stand on her own two feet via the advice of an older man -- albeit one who says things like ""I hate to be the feminist here but . . ."" The best you can hope for is finding some passing enjoyment in the high jinks that ensue as Ben tries to fit in. Adam DeVine (""Pitch Perfect"") Zack Pearlman and Jason Orley are a Greek chorus of mop-topped hipsters naturally drawn to Ben as Brooklynites are to all things vintage. Nat Wolff (""Paper Towns"") whose role must have been bigger originally appears for a nanosecond to interview Ben -- and the moment when he realizes one ought not ask a 70-year-old applicant ""Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"" is amusing. Anne Hathaway and Robert De NiroPhoto Warner Bros. Rene Russo is luminous as the company masseuse and the object of widower Bens affections though his visible arousal during her chair massage -- which earns him high-fives from his bros -- is one of the films ickier moments. (In real life her next move might be a sexual-harassment claim rather than acceptance of his dinner invitation.) Theres a story going around this week about how De Niro bristled when an interviewer asked him about acting ""on autopilot."" After seeing ""The Intern"" you understand why hed want to dodge that question because the role demands little more of him than impeccable posture and a grandfatherly eye twinkle. It also hamstrings Hathaway whose type-A character is never sullied by an ugly thought or deed. To their credit Meyers films have always been about basically decent people navigating lifes various hurdles. Here though her characters have gone from ""Its Complicated"" to ""Its Pretty Straightforward Actually.""

He doesnt say ""You talkin to me?"" or pull a gun though. This time he practices blinking his eyes while he talks because his character a 70-year-old widower named Ben Whittaker has just become an unpaid intern at an Internet fashion startup run by a beautiful dynamo--Anne Hathaways Jules Ostin--and she hates having conversations with unblinking people.

Updated July 30 2016  702 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Close Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro in ""The Intern"" The Intern gets the job done By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Sep 24 2015 (...) Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro in ""The Intern"" Jules (Anne Hathaway) is an Internet entrepreneur who constantly hops on a bicycle to monitor the activities in her rapidly growing startup. Even so its hard for her to keep up but she insists that shes on top of the situation.Ben (Robert De Niro) is a retiree and widower in search of a new challenge. So when he learns that Jules company is open to hiring interns of a certain age hes happy to apply for a job -- and even happier when he lands one.Jules however isnt exactly welcoming. She looks at him and sees not a man with a wealth of experience but an old guy who doesnt fit into her hip dot-com environment. What can he possibly do for her? Undaunted Ben quickly becomes an indispensable member of the staff -- and with his suit-and-tie style a sharp contrast to his young casually dressed and more than slightly goofy colleagues.An astute observer of human nature Ben also becomes the friend that Jules -- whose position at the company is under question and whose personal life is an escalating mess -- doesnt even realize she needs. Not at first anyway.""The Intern"" is the latest comedy from writer-director Nancy Meyers (""Somethings Gotta Give"" ""Its Complicated""). Although its unlikely to be remembered come Oscar time and ultimately succumbs to sentimentality its mostly charming and fun to watch. And Meyers who has often been criticized for the spectacular lifestyles of her characters has added a bit more grit this time around. Jules and Ben come across as financially comfortable but not fabulously rich.De Niro who in recent films has often seemed to be merely going through the motions delivers a delightful performance as Ben. And he has terrific chemistry with Hathaway who strikes just the right balance between humor and angst. These days its tough to find a comedy that even aspires to sophistication. ""The Intern"" entertainingly fills that slot.What ""The Intern""  Three stars out of four  Run time 201  Rating PG-13  Content Suggestive content language  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Nancy Meyers knows viewers dont see her movies for plot twists Filmmaker discusses ""The Intern"" set design and the possibility of a remake of ""Private Benjamin.""

EntertainmentMovies The Intern does a pleasant job Originally published September 24 2015 at 1218 pm Updated September 24 2015 at 124 pm The boss of a fashion website (Anne Hathaway) comes to realize the worth of the new ""Intern"" (Robert De Niro). (Warner Bros Entertainment/TNS) Movie review of ""The Intern"" Everything unfolds pleasantly in this film about a 70-year-old widower (Robert De Niro) who gets an internship at a startup fashion website. Anne Hathaway plays his boss. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Slight but charming Nancy Meyers ""The Intern"" almost goes terribly wrong in its first minutes but quickly rights itself. We meet Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) a genial 70-year-old Brooklyn widower who weary of retirement has applied for a senior internship program at a startup fashion website. His neighbor (Linda Lavin) of similar age expresses dismay that he would want to work in ""e-commerce ... whatever that is"" and wonders how its possible to sell clothes online. I stifled a sigh ... was this going to be two hours of Isnt It Funny How Old People Dont Know What the Internet Is? Nope Ben though he carries a flip phone and no laptop in his old-school briefcase turns out to be extremely good at his job and quick to learn and Jules (Anne Hathaway) the overworked boss whos half his age rapidly comes to realize his worth. Soon Bens calling his millennial co-workers ""dude"" and helping them dress to impress (""Youre saying you shave every day?"" asks one in wonder) while befriending Jules and her picture-perfect husband (Anders Holm) and daughter (JoJo Kushner). Thats pretty much the extent of it; everything unfolds pleasantly full of the lavish interiors and perpetual niceness that Meyers (""Somethings Gotta Give"" ""Its Complicated"") is known for. (Jules company is the prettiest startup youll ever see.) Theres a blandness to the writing that makes you wish for a little spikiness somewhere -- you wonder if Tina Fey who was originally cast as Jules but eventually dropped out might have sounded a welcome quirky note -- but De Niro brings a sweetness to his underwritten role thats irresistible particularly in a wordless moment where Bens remembering his late wife. Movie Review 1/2   The Intern with Robert De Niro Anne Hathaway Rene Russo Anders Holm Andrew Rannells Adam Devine Celia Weston Nat Wolff Linda Lavin JoJo Kushner. Written and directed by Nancy Meyers. 121 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some suggestive content and brief strong language. Several theaters. ""The Intern"" doesnt have much to do with real life (Jules kid for example is less a child than an adorable prop) and if youve seen the trailer youve pretty much seen the entire movie. But sometimes well-dressed fantasy plus popcorn is just the thing. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

The movie is hugely flawed but impressive chemistry between Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway will keep you watching long past the point where it makes sense to do so. De Niro stars as Ben Whittaker a septuagenarian widower who is bored with retirement. He has tried a dozen different courses and classes to spend his time usefully but nothing quite clicks for him. Ben misses the routine and the discipline of daily work so when he sees a flier advertising jobs for Senior Interns he goes for it. The interns are sought by a start-up fashion business an online clothing company that promises customers a perfect fit and quick delivery. Its the brainchild of Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) a hip young entrepreneur who runs her business out of a super-cool converted warehouse in Brooklyn. As one does. Hiring older interns who would bring a wealth of life and work experience with them to the job is an idea put forward by Jules office manager Cameron (Andrew Rannells); Jules herself is not really that keen on the notion. But the Senior Interns are hired anyway and all the bright young things working for Jules are both confused and amused when Ben Whittaker is suddenly at a desk in their midst. The Intern has plenty of generational visual jokes -- into a thicket of sleek Apple products at the office Ben brings his old-school calculator flip phone and clock carrying them in a briefcase yet -- but as time passes the younger workers come to respect him and his work ethic. Ben can advise on everything from marketing to mens fashion. Watch the trailer for The Intern At first hes just a nuisance to Jules who likes to do everything herself but he eventually makes an ally of her too. Taking on the job of her driver one day Ben meets Jules stay-at-home husband and her little daughter. Seems theres trouble on the home front because Jules is working so hard at all times. She doesnt see her daughter enough and her husband feels a bit neglected. Luckily Ben can advise her on that too. Our feisty workaholic has been told to take on a CEO at her business lest the company grow so fast that it gets away from her; Jules doesnt want to relinquish control but fears shell lose her marriage and her chance at a full life if she doesnt. She wrings her hands. Ben offers wise counsel. What we have here is a stand-up guy from the Mad Men generation patiently explaining a feminist worldview to a contemporary working woman. Its like the Hot Tub Time Machine took you back to 1968. On Bizarro World. As we said earlier only the impressive chemistry between Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway will keep you watching; we havent even mentioned the painfully ageist sex jokes or the silly plot developments that unfold like sitcom padding. On the positive side De Niro is understated here not his usual M.O. in comedy and it works beautifully. Hathaway is likewise attractive carefully winning over a viewer as she creates a flawed but admirable character -- no easy feat with this material.

"The Intern makes life look positively sunny review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Intern makes life look positively sunny review If Martha Stewart ever becomes a film director she will make movies like The Intern the latest confection from Nancy Meyers. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Sept. 24 2015The InternStarring Robert De Niro Anne Hathaway Anders Holm and JoJo Kushner. Directed by Nancy Meyers. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. 121 minutes. PGIf Martha Stewart ever becomes a film director she will make movies like The Intern the latest Nancy Meyers confection.Such a movie is lavishly sculpted like Stewarts twice-baked biscotti to make even the most humdrum event seem worthy of celebration. Article Continued BelowEveryone in Meyers celestial casts are jolly even when theyre not supposed to be and why not? Delicious food and drink abound everyone owns an Apple gadget and lives in a designer abode and epiphanies occur every 10 minutes or so accompanied by a triumphal soundtrack swell. Hes The Intern and shes the boss. Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway star in Nancy Meyers latest film.  (Warner Bros Entertainment)  Even the sun seems happy to dance to Meyers lifestyle symphony cheerfully popping up on cue in her brightly appointed frame. The Intern offers more of the same with Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway being the celebrities du jour and it must be said that gruff De Niro delivers a charming performance opposite the reliably perky Hathaway. Theres a teensy plot twist. Instead of hilariously exploring domestic tangles in the style of Shes Gotta Give and Its Complicated Meyers moves into the workplace although home is still just a pleasant Subaru drive away.A cross between Mary Poppins and The Devil Wears Prada the film is another crowd-pleaser -- albeit one with the knotty subtext that women seeking harmony at home and office need a father figure to light the path.That figure is De Niros Ben a 70-year-old recent widower who has grown tired of doing Tai Chi in the park and taking Mandarin lessons. He longs to be back in the office as he was for 40 years as a telephone book maker.He volunteers as an elder intern at the booming Brooklyn e-commerce clothing firm created by Hathaways Jules a thirty-something workaholic who uses a bicycle to speed between the desks of her dutiful drones.Gentle Ben just wants to help any way he can. Frazzled Jules doesnt want him around -- she finds him ""too observant."" But when her regular chauffeur turns unreliable Ben slides behind the wheel and begins touring her around NYC and also her life. He offers business advice and family counselling too assisting Jules neglected house hubby (Anders Holm) and precocious young daughter (JoJo Kushner). He even brings Jules chicken soup.Before you know it -- and of course you already knew it -- shes fallen for his old-school charms. Which is not to remotely suggest anything sexual or even romantic. The closest these two get to a bed is sitting on one while watching Gene Kelly croon ""You Were Meant For Me"" to Debbie Reynolds in a Netflix screening of Singin in the Rain.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday September 24 2015 Follow AnnHornaday Widower Ben (Robert De Niro) signs on to help the much younger Jules (Anne Hathaway) as an intern at her clothing company. (Francois Duhamel/Warner Bros. Pictures) Robert De Niro attains peak adorable-ness in ""The Intern"" a genial gentle regrettably bland comedy by writer-director Nancy Meyers. For particular audiences Meyers has become a reliable purveyor of stories about funny flawed people of a certain age bringing her signature brand of observant humor and fetishistic production values to such wry over-40 rom-coms as ""Somethings Gotta Give"" and ""Its Complicated."" With ""The Intern"" she changes things up a bit Rather than the perfect copper-plated kitchens and cozy living rooms shes become famous for this movie inhabits the sleek wired-in world of a Brooklyn loft where a newly successful entrepreneur named Jules (Anne Hathaway) runs her e-tail clothing business. Having launched a search for senior citizen interns (then promptly forgotten about it) Jules is urged to take one under her own wing for appearances sake. Enter Ben Whittaker (De Niro) a 70-year-old widower who last worked producing phone books and who arrives promptly every day dressed in suit and tie briefcase in hand pocket square pressed. The clash of analog and digital cultures makes for the most obvious humor in ""The Intern"" which features an early eye-rolling scene of Ben and a neighbor (Linda Lavin) professing mutual ignorance of how those newfangled computer-machine thingies actually work. Once Ben and Jules get to know each other though the story takes on less predictable textures What at first threatens to be a thinly disguised Baby Boomer screed against Millennial laziness and entitlement winds up being a surprisingly affecting meditation on ambition self-doubt gender roles and the enduring search for balance between ""love and work work and love"" as Ben intones during the films opening sequence. Hes quoting Freud of course and traces of Oedipal wish fulfillment can be discerned in Juless relationship with a man who represents a father figure at its most idealized and supportive. Theres no chance of romance between the two (he becomes infatuated with the company masseuse played by the sensational Rene Russo) so what unfolds is something filmgoers dont see every day a genuine friendship between a grown man and younger woman uncontaminated by jejune cliches or icky innuendo. For that alone and for its feminist politics ""The Intern"" deserves congratulations -- but sadly enlightened principles arent enough to make a film fun to watch. Although Hathaway adroitly avoids playing Jules as yet another brittle neurotic career gal shes almost completely devoid of the contradictions that would make the character far more interesting. Meyers clearly didnt want to punish Juless ambition by making her unsympathetic but the result is a character with no edges -- sharp or otherwise -- to speak of. (Her biggest flaws are a weakness for multitasking and not getting enough sleep.) The de-fanging works better with De Niro who made a career of embodying volcanic menace and now exudes a quietly befuddled Teddy bear-ish charm. Watching him interact with his younger co-workers -- at one point explaining what its like to shave every day later taking them on a bizarre junket to dismantle Juless mothers computer -- accounts for most of the laughs in ""The Intern"" which features Andrew Rannells Adam DeVine Zack Pearlman and Jason Orley in appealing supporting roles. As charming as De Niro is one cant help feeling that one more pass through the laptop might have made ""The Intern"" sharper keener maybe more confrontational and spikily funny. (Like most comedies these days this one is at least 20 minutes too long.) Instead Meyers seems content to make a nice movie about nice people doing their best to be nice to each other despite one or two not-nice things that happen along the way. Thats all very nice but not particularly the stuff of potent or rousing entertainment. ""The Intern"" feels a little bit like the tai chi exercises that Ben does in the park throughout the film -- you look for something to react to and laugh at and maybe even shed a tear about but you wind up pushing against a puff of air. PG-13.  At area theaters. Contains some suggestive content and brief strong profanity. 121 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"The Intern review Hathaway De Niro work it - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Intern review Hathaway De Niro work it The Intern Warner Bros. Pictures Robert De Niro as intern Ben Whittaker and Anne Hathaway playing Jules Ostin are easy company in the comedy ""The Intern."" Robert De Niro as intern Ben Whittaker and Anne Hathaway playing Jules Ostin are easy company in the comedy ""The Intern."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune And you thought Friends was white Nicely acted by Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro the artificial sweetener titled ""The Intern"" has its bright spots but is practically blinded by its own privileged perspective of life among the landed gentry of Brooklyn.Its not fair to single out the writer-director Nancy Meyers whose better work includes ""Somethings Gotta Give"" and ""Its Complicated"" for making high-end escapist fantasies about a certain socioeconomic strata. Most Hollywood products work the same way. But this is a particularly frustrating case because Meyers latest has many good lines and good laughs and even entire good scenes. Since his wifes passing retiree Ben Whittaker played by De Niro has lived a pleasantly routinized life alone for three years. Hired as a senior intern at a JackThreads-type online clothing company hes assigned to the bustling startups founder and honcho Jules Ostin played by Hathaway in perpetual ""go"" mode. Jules tools around her companys fabulous gut-rehab warehouse on a bicycle and never remembers to eat.At first Jules has no use for Ben who sports the sole suit and tie amid a sea of unshaven chins and untucked shirts. Scene by scene the boss comes to realize how much wisdom experience advice and class this man has to offer although a good deal of his internship is spent chauffeuring Jules from her mouthwatering Park Slope brownstone to work and back again. These scenes with Jules frantically working her iPhone suggest an alternate title ""Driving Miss Texty."" Surprisingly the biggest broadest comic interlude clicks a secret mission conducted by Ben and his fellow (and much younger) co-workers to retrieve a laptop from Jules parents house. In her best dialogue about the stresses of work/life balance Meyers suggests a measure of ambivalence and complication in its treatment of Jules although on the surface shes just another type-A workaholic out of a rom-com.The rom in ""The Intern"" is fraught for Jules; her marriage to an apparently genial supportive husband (Anders Holm duller than his material even) suffers from issues undetected by their grade-school daughter (JoJo Kushner). For Ben the roms provided by the clothing companys staff masseuse played by Rene Russo. While Jules wrestles with a decision to hire a CEO Ben is there always guiding her way. The Intern (Clip) Clip Hows that Ben? Sept. 23 2015. (ScreenPlay) Clip Hows that Ben? Sept. 23 2015. (ScreenPlay) See more videos Different movies stoke different raging class issues in different people. Preston Sturges created confectionary treats (some of the tastiest ever in cinema) celebrating the joys of high living while remaining witty about the excess. Meyers has wit and a solid sense of craft but mainly she makes movies about high thread counts and comfy pricey throw pillows. Theres not much at stake for Ben; judging from the size and furnishings of his bedroom closet this longtime phone book company executive is living a supremely comfortable retirement. Jules learns to be a less judgy more nurturing leader and friend.Hathaway and De Niro are easy company though there are times when De Niro mugging in close-up seems no better an idea here than it did in ""Little Fockers."" Both actors suggest inner lives for their characters even though the film itself is more of an outie -- a collection of looks and smiles and attractive surfaces. As for composer Theodore Shapiros musical score ... its awful. Pushy insistent it slathers every exchange each new Meyers montage (the one on the plane may be the least necessary montage in montage history) with fake good cheer. Less is more with some composers; with this score I wonder if ""none"" wouldve been the better option. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.

Pictures release. (Courtesy ... more Photo Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures Associated Press A little too tidy but The Intern does a good job 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""The Intern"" is a nice movie about nice people living in a world in which everyone is nice. It leaves audiences with a nice feeling and yet with another feeling sneaking into the background like the slightly bad taste that follows a sweet drink. Its the feeling of having seen something phony. But ""phony"" is too strong a word for this. ""The Intern"" was written and directed by Nancy Meyers and in no way seems to lie or pander. It seems the product of a sincere vision but what a vision. Its hard to know whats the right response -- admiration or perplexity maybe a mix of both -- to see an imaginative world made entirely of smooth surfaces. For sure its some kind of achievement to make really sweet people entertaining for two whole hours. Throughout the movie were told that Jules an Internet clothing entrepreneur is one tough character but at her most unkind moments shes slightly curt -- thats about the worst that can be said for her. For the most part she just seems like Anne Hathaway as we usually find her smiling brightly and occasionally bursting into tears. We find out that Jules started her business a year and a half ago and now employs over 200 people. Its typical of this movie -- even the business environment is fantastic. Most of the action is seen through the eyes of the title character a 70-year-old retired man who gets hired as a ""senior intern"" at Jules company. Ben (Robert De Niro) is a widower but were told that his late wife was amazing and within days of his start at the clothing company the on-staff masseuse is coming on to him. Ben has a charmed life The masseuse is played by Rene Russo. Even if you didnt see the coming-attractions trailer or the advertisement (""Experience never gets old"") youd have a pretty good idea where this movie has to go. The artistry of ""The Intern"" is that Meyers figures out how to make the inevitable interesting or at least interesting enough. We are made to feel almost by instinct without really being told that Ben has things to teach Jules and were also made to care that Jules learns them. The writer-director doesnt give De Niro much to work with but she probably knew that and consequently found an actor who could make up the difference. Bens life as written is little more than a series of cliches but De Niro goes through the movie saying a lot just by the way he looks at people. Its written into the script that Ben is observant and in De Niros gaze we see something we dont usually see -- the pity of the old for the young for all their emotional torments avoidable mistakes and illusion of infinite time. As for Hathaway it would be easy to say that she goes too soft on Jules and tries to make the audience love her but the truth is she can only work with the script that she has. On the few occasions when she gets to show a darker side or open up into the characters pain Hathaway does it. And she doesnt overdo it. Later looking back on ""The Intern"" you may wonder if the relationship between Jules and Ben was just smoke and mirrors. Most of their conversations consist of little but her talking and him listening and their one scene of abandoned rapport -- on an airplane flying first class -- has no dialogue. Its just a montage scene of laughing and carrying on but we have no idea what theyre saying. But so what? Movies are smoke and mirrors. Theyre all about seduction and their job is not to be worthy of belief but to make you want to believe. The success of this film may ride entirely on the alchemy of these particular actors but whatever is carrying it ""The Intern"" gets there. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway each has something to offer the other in ""The Intern."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Comedies usually run 90 minutes because they simply want to amuse and laughing usually runs out of gas after an hour and a half. Dramas generally run on for two hours because they have a heavier workload in aiming to deal with important issues -- and that can take a while. Nancy Meyers light amusement ""The Intern"" actually lasts a little more than two hours. As it tries to sustain conceits beyond lightweight wit and into ageism and important life lessons and weeping and hugging it feels like an eternity. The film resembles a stretched out and only slightly modernized version of the classic workplace comedy ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" This time the 30-ish woman at the center of the story Jules (Anne Hathaway) owns the workplace where its set an e-commerce clothing boutique called ""About the Fit."" The strong but lovable veteran she befriends is Ben (Robert De Niro) a 70-year-old retired executive who joins her companys new ""senior internship program."" Its only days before he works his way up to being her personal chauffeur business adviser and lifestyle mentor. De Niro who has never before smiled nonstop in a film plays this fountain of avuncular wisdom as paternalistic as Lou Grant and almost as gruff but in a nice way. Formally attired among his scruffy-looking new teammates Ben explains that the reason he carries a fresh handkerchief in his jacket every day is ""to lend it"" to a teary woman. He counsels another befuddled guy how to make up with a colleague he romantically offended by sleeping with her bestie and instructs a third that hed make a better impression if he bothered to tuck in his shirt. Old school rules the day in writer/director Meyers senior-centric work (like ""Its Complicated"" and ""Somethings Gotta Give""). But because this is a 21st-century take on TVs 1970s hit Ben calls the granddaughter-aged Jules ""Boss."" Meyers puts the pair into a cheerful story designed to make us feel nice and nothing more. It spoon-feeds us vanilla fiction to the point of overdose. Perfectionist Jules has rocketed to national success in just 18 months a rags to riches Internet success story that Mark Zuckerberg would envy. Shes initially suspicious of the companys new recruit (""too observant"" she grouses). But as he wins the welcome of her little angel daughter and stay-at-home husband Jules turns to him for the kind of advice she never gets from her unseen mother who throughout repeated phone calls never says ""I love you."" Unfortunately none of the challenges Jules faces are deep enough to provide dramatic ammunition. Her home life experiences a minor dilemma; an accomplished potential CEO to carry her start-up forward may have some flaws. None of it builds to a meaningful crisis. Nor beyond two naughty scenes with Rene Russo as the corporate masseuse giving De Niro stimulating rubdowns is it especially amusing. Ben who joined the millennial crowd because he was tired of retirement tedium would feel the same watching this movie. I hope he has a hankie handy; hell be bored to tears. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Comments (1) click to enlarge The Intern Rated PG-13  121 minutes  2015 In this crowd-pleasing rom-com by Nancy Meyers (Somethings Gotta Give) a bored widowed retiree (Robert De Niro) hires on as an intern for an online clothing boutique launched by a harried millennial overachiever (Anne Hathaway). Like no other Hollywood writer-director Meyers has carved out a niche market for herself with sitcom-lite stories for middle-aged and elderly women as evidenced here by the De Niro characters mentoring of the clueless unshaven hipsters populating the companys open-floor-plan office (he teaches them to carry a handkerchief in case a woman needs it to cry into). There are a few good laughs but they struggle to survive amid the syrupy score overlit interiors and smothering sense of middle-class entitlement. Rene Russo turns up as De Niros age-appropriate love interest; they were better together playing Boris and Natasha in The Adventures of Rocky amp; Bullwinkle. By J.R.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet What might have once seemed like heresy now feels like an inevitability Given Robert De Niros late-career embrace of big-studio comedies and dramedies sooner or later he had to find himself in a Nancy Meyers film. Over the course of her successful Hollywood career Meyers has endeavored to hire name actors of a certain age having given late-career hits to Jack Nicholson Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep; hers is a filmography where Steve Martin Alec Baldwin and Mel Gibson count as relatively young bucks. Even with plenty of Focker experience De Niro doesnt seem like a great fit for the copper-pot white-sweater aesthetic favored by movies like Somethings Gotta Give or Its Complicated. But in The Intern (somehow not titled You Know How It Goes) Meyers taps into De Niros sometimes underappreciated talent for conveying warmth. Ben Whittaker the retiree De Niro plays doesnt exist to administer grumbly dressing-downs and grimaces to young people; he responds to an ad for a senior intern program in all earnestness looking for something to occupy his time as a lonely but still energetic widower. Interning at About The Fit a burgeoning ecommerce start-up run by thirtysomething Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) beats the workaday boredom of retirement--a sentiment that presumably applies to actors signing up for a Nancy Meyers comedy too.""Comedy"" may not be the right word. Though Jules is initially disinterested in her companys intern program the movie doesnt place her and Ben at comical odds. She ignores him he begins to learn the ropes at a company with no walls and lots of email and she takes notice of his unflagging loyalty. Soon hes serving as Jules driver and sometime confidante as she receives pressure to hire a more experienced CEO to run the company she founded. Thankfully their closeness never turns into a May-December flirtation. After a sometimes-grueling series of romances Meyers has made a movie about male-female friendship--about two people who come to really like each other. Jules admires Bens old-fashioned work ethic and positive attitude; Ben admires Jules for her toughness and business sense; and Meyers it seems really digs both of them and with far less toxic self-regard than some of her other films. The obligatory scene where she writes dialogue complimenting her own writing comes early and just once when an About The Fit employee mentions that Bens application video--the narration of which Meyers has just used to open the movie--made some people cry.Meyers also limits her usual conspicuous displays of wealth at least as much as she can. Hard-charging Jules and mild-mannered Ben both live in well-appointed two-story homes with beds covered in throw pillows because Meyers cannot conceive of a world where a successful person might not buy dozens of throw pillows. But the ostentatiousness is confined slightly by the movies Brooklyn setting (still watch out Brooklyn; you just became Nancy Meyers territory) and more so by its leads. In the past Hathaway has appeared overly studied in her glossy comedies but here juggling her job husband and young daughter she gives a more relaxed performance even when playing high-strung. (She nearly sells the notion that a thirtysomething woman would wistfully pine for the days of real men like Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford--in other words nearly makes Nancy Meyers tastes sound like her own.) De Niro too slips into his role with ease. He sometimes looks at her like an admiring father might but never tips into condescending lecturing.Their relationship is very sweet but its not very funny. Its also not save for a few dilemmas that pop up in the final stretch particularly dramatic or compelling beyond the smiles of its magnetic leads De Niros small and crinkly and Hathaways wider and flanked by parenthetical dimples. They make good company and for much of its running time The Intern proceeds through a series of extended pleasantries. Ben helps Jules; Jules appreciates Ben; Ben helps some likable goofballs (Adam DeVine Zack Pearlman Jason Orley) at the office and they engage in the movies single instance of comic shenanigans the mildest slightest possible style parody of the Oceans movies as they bumble through the retrieval of a mis-addressed email.The lack of comic goals allows Meyers to write and write; a key emotional scene between De Niro and Hathaway late in the movie rambles on like a first draft and the movie swells to the two-hour mark. This kind of unhurried low-conflict story coming from a mainstream filmmaker might be more invigorating if not for the eventually wearying idealization of the De Niro character and the odd implications that come along with it. Absent an object of romance the usual Nancy Meyers fantasizing creates an employee who lives only for his job comes to treat his co-workers (and no one else) as family and does it all for no money indefinitely. De Niro and Hathaway then reveal themselves as almost dangerously charming. They nearly disguise that Meyers while trying to make a feminist movie about friendship has cheerily advocated for the enslavement of the elderly.

VPCNancy Meyers writes and directs a film about an older man (Robert De Niro) who goes to work as an intern for a much-younger boss (Anne Hathaway). Too Boomer-centric but De Niro and Hathaway sell it.A retired widower decides to head back into the workforce as an intern for a website and finds himself mentoring his new 30-something boss.(Photo Warner Bros.)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 stars out of 5The film falls into the trap of thinking only Boomers have the answersDe Niro and Hathaway have such a nice chemistry it overcomes many of the films problems""The Intern"" is idiotic unrealistic Boomer wish fulfillment that has no business working on any level.I quite enjoyed it.Dont misunderstand What happens in writer and director Nancy Meyers movie is nothing short of absurd and its flawed in about 10 ways. Ben (Robert De Niro) gets hired as a ""senior"" intern at an Internet startup that sells clothes (clothes that fit evidently a concept novel enough you can base a company on it). Ultra-type-A-personality Jules (Anne Hathaway) runs About the Fit .There are plenty of jokes at first about Bens age (hes 70) and how it must surely be a poor fit with the brotastic vibe at the company the eternally busy Jules founded. A widower bored with retirement Ben saw a flier for the job and got his 9-year-old grandson to help him with a video application. Soon not only is he hired but hes assigned to be the personal intern of Jules who acknowledges that she thinks its a bad idea and that shes hard to get along with.Of course one of the things Ben has going for him is that he is in reality De Niro perhaps the greatest actor of his generation. Its like Clark Kent taking off the glasses and becoming Superman. Only Ben is too old to ever take off his glasses so he does the heavy lifting with them on.AZCENTRALList of movies opening in fall 2015Ben is nothing short of a messiah figure perfect in every way. He never takes a false step does all the right things and has plenty of ""life experience"" so that he can help everyone with their problems including the initially reluctant Jules.Especially Jules.Somehow she had the vision and effort to create a ridiculously successful company that reached its five-year goals in nine months but is now being doubted by her investors. So whats wrong? They worry the gravy train will run dry so they want a male CEO to take over the company to ... what? Slow growth? Is that a viable business option? Maybe.But the idea is also that the workaholic Jules can be freed up to concentrate on riding her bike around the office or whatever (it saves time) -- or perhaps spend more time with her husband (Anders Holm) and daughter (JoJo Kushner) who feel her absence in the typical punish-the-mom-for-working ways. (A sad little snippy Greek chorus of stay-at-home moms at Jules daughters school drive the point home in case you missed it.)There are other complications and at one point Ben while talking to Jules says ""I hate to have to be the feminist here but. ..."" Hey why not? Meyers seems reluctant to have anyone else do the job.AZCENTRALThe Intern (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsIts the 25th anniversary of ""Goodfellas"" in which De Niro plays one of his scariest characters the murderous gangster Jimmy Conway. Theres no trace of that in Ben except perhaps when he warns Jules driver about drinking on the job. Its amazing that the same guy plays both roles. But there is a sweet chemistry between Ben and Jules; De Niro and Hathaway dont make it too sugary at least not at first.Unfortunately Meyers makes the same mistake so many Boomers make Thinking the sun shines out of their belly buttons and no one elses. Only Ben can have the answers whether the problem is big or small. He might as well live on top of a mountain that Jules scales every so often seeking sage advice.Thats the kind of thing that keeps ""The Intern"" from being better than it might have been. But thanks to De Niro and Hathaway its better than it should be.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Writer-director Nancy Meyers makes comfort comedies (Its Complicated Somethings Gotta Give) that play like the movie equivalent of mac and cheese and her latest The Intern may sink you into a feel-good coma. Robert De Niro plays twinkly retired New Yorker Ben. Epically failing to adjust to retirement (hes in Starbucks with the newspaper every morning at 715am) he signs up for a seniors intern program. After a borderline-patronizing interview (""Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"") Ben lands a gig with a fashion e-store. His boss is kooky Jules (Hathaway relentlessly wholesome) who cycles around the office a converted Brooklyn factory and is under pressure from her big-money investors to sell out and hire a CEO to run her booming start-up. The world of The Intern is shamelessly fake. This is the fashion industry but forget about any bitching Everyone is psychotically pleasant. Are the straight-out-of-college kids awkward around the old dude with a briefcase? No because hes retro cool like a brick-size vintage cell phone bought on eBay. The movies ideas run out quickly but De Niro is easygoing and The Intern is indulgent good fun. Just dont go in expecting nutrition.

Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Some veteran filmmakers try to capture the younger generation and fail to get it right coming up with characters and faux with-it dialogue that invite lots of ""Oh Mom"" eye-rolling. Thats not the problem with writer-director Nancy Meyerss The Intern in which retiree Robert De Niro finds meaning in life -- and brings lots of twinkly-gruff inspiration to others -- by taking an internship at a Brooklyn-based online clothing company run by ambitious yet dippy businesswoman Anne Hathaway.Its easy enough to live with Meyerss characterization of young professional Brooklynites -- the men in baggy tees topped with plaid shirts that substitute for superhero capes the women in short peppy skirts and flats -- all camped out in a massive Red Hook office space expensively remodeled to look like an old printing press. (Because guess what? It used to be one.) Whats harder to buy is Meyerss characterization of older people -- specifically De Niros Ben who spent some 40 years as a manager of a company that in olden days printed phone books and who has at age 70 somehow amassed enough wealth for a cozy New York retirement in which he never has to think about money at all. In fact the only thing he has to worry about is boredom. From my lips to Gods ears Please let this be me in twenty years.Film Details The Intern RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time121 min. More Info Trailer Wanting more out of life than this highly fictional super-chill retiree experience Ben applies for -- and gets -- a ""senior"" internship at the crazily successful company founded by go-getter Jules (Hathaway). Shes the kind of boss whos glad to do stuff like take a turn at manning the customer service desk and she rides around the cavernous office space adorably on a bicycle. No wonder her employees love to love-hate her.Ben quickly makes himself indispensable doling out sensible advice business-y and otherwise to the younguns. He also wears a suit which they love -- in one of the movies best scenes he gives style tips to a young worker (Peter Vack) whos nervous when he discovers he might be hand-delivering an order to Jay Z. At first Jules is wary of Ben -- hes too ""observant"" she tells her second-in-command (Andrew Rannells) via youths communication medium of choice the text message. (Meyers So with it.) Shes also feeling vulnerable because her investors are pushing her to hire an actual experienced CEO. As if that werent enough her seemingly awesome but also undeniably emasculated stay-at-home-dad husband (Anders Holm) may not be staying at home as much as she thinks.Theres a lot going on in The Intern but all you have to know really is that Ben is rock-solid and Jules is a winsome puddle of insecurity and awesomeness. Its astonishing to watch De Niro -- who has been great in great movies like The Godfather Part II and Taxi Driver and sometimes just as good or even better in imperfect ones like New York New York -- and realize that hes just as capable as any other actor of slouching through a film like a lump of mold making its way down a tree limb. Its as if hes trying to keep all traces of actual personality or verve under wraps. Here and there he squeezes out a few sparks of enthusiasm as when the companys in-house masseuse (the fetching Rene Russo) comes a-calling to give him an almost NSFW massage. (In the real world this would be sexual-harassment fodder big time but never mind.)Hathaways like a deer startled at every noise in the forest.De Niros lifelessness may not really be his fault. Meyers has built a career out of making zeitgeist-straddling movies (Somethings Gotta Give What Women Want) that like Winston Churchill with his martini merely bow in the direction of France instead of adding actual vermouth She serves up the promised main ingredient but the subtler more probing notes are always missing. The Intern makes a show of digging into of-the-moment issues the idea of women in positions of power being resented by their partners their friends everybody; the need for ""older"" people -- who today are younger than ever -- to feel needed and wanted in society. But Meyers cant resist adding lots of godawful mischievous tiptoeing-elf music (courtesy of composer Theodore Shapiro). The spongy subtext of this and every Meyers movie is ""Were being serious but were also being FUN"" No viewer must ever be made to think too much feel too much or be left out. She doesnt so much tell a story as lead a team-building exercise.Hathaway unfortunately fits right into the plan. One minute Jules is the upbeat fireball company owner She can bring home the bacon fry it up in the pan But apparently in the context of her achievements her husband sometimes forgets hes a man -- or her man that is. (Meyers to her credit doesnt blame Jules for his waywardness but hubby is so agreeably bland at home that its almost a relief to learn he actually has a sex drive.) When the truth hits Jules the Fantine tears start spilling. Hathaway can be a lovely screen presence but more directors need to rein in the too-muchness of her. She has the long-legged gait and the glinty saucer eyes of a cartoon deer -- but with all those nerve endings so close to the surface she needs to be soothed into laughing things off not startling at every noise in the forest. At one point Ben having become Juless de facto personal driver drops her at her gorgeous yet aggressively humble Park Slope brownstone long after dark where her husband and cheerful moppet of a daughter await. ""I love this house"" she says gazing at its tasteful period detail its many windows lit from within by lamps that are probably from Target because everyone even the hugely rich and successful shops there. ""It just looks happy to me.""Its happy all right -- for the record probably about 3.8 million worth of happy. But still Jules has her problems just like you and me and in this moment shes so overcome with wonder at her sweet little spot of real estate that its a marvel the waterworks dont start spurting right then and there. She loves her life but its hard. Because whose isnt? The Intern has its finger on the pulse of young and old today. The heartbeat is the thing it fails to detect.The Intern Written and directed by Nancy Meyers Warner Bros. Opens September 25 Written and directed by Nancy Meyers.

But this is a film by Nancy Meyers whose Crate amp; Barrel comedies -- full of lame characters lavish furnishings tastefully drab colors no sharp edges -- like ""Its Complicated"" and ""Somethings Gotta Give"" have made her our foremost chronicler of the privileged class enjoying their privileges. Long on kitchen-design erotica and short on conflict ""The Intern"" is a cozy slanket of a movie one that wraps you up in a suffocating hug and tries to waterboard you with the milk of human kindness. See Video Robert De Niro Is Anne Hathaways Newest Employee in The Intern Trailer (Video) That isnt necessarily a bad thing or rather its exactly the thing that ticket buyers want out of a comedy this fuzzily edge-less Lessons learned feelings shared wisdom imparted and received. ""The Internship"" delivers what it promises no more and no less and faulting it for not being a rougher tougher smarter film about how much we all seem to live our lives through our work today would be like yelling at a spoon for not being a knife. Read More See Robert De Niro Michelle Pfeiffer in First Look of HBOs Bernie Madoff Biopic (Photo) De Niros Ben Whittaker gets the gig as an intern at Hathaways e-shopping empire About the Fit. Hes assigned directly to Hathaways frazzled founder Jules Ostin. Shes initially reluctant but Bens usefulness and old-school stoicism wind up making him at first useful and then indispensable. Thats one of the biggest problems with ""The Intern"" namely that Ben is defined by his being widowed kindly and avuncular and by almost nothing else Hes perfect a Magical Senior who exists only to improve the lives of the needy flawed people around him with almost no thought of his own needs or flaws. Read More Hank Azaria Cast in HBOs Bernie Madoff Movie Wizard of Lies Hathaways Jules is more of a wreck but that shouldnt be confused for depth of character; shes just a problem for De Niro to gracefully gradually solve. Jules has a company and a marriage and a child and no it turns out she can not have it all; thanks to Bens tutelage though she figures out what she can have and what she truly wants. Meyers is a slightly shabby scripter -- theres a comedy scene involving a waylaid e-mail that does nothing even though its rather funny -- and you can see the films every twist and turn so far in advance that the film might as well be shouting each of its plot points from your Waze app. Even so if ""The Intern"" is a little bland and basic at least the people onscreen execute their duties well enough. De Niro plays a real character here not just an assemblage of acting tics and facial expressions; Hathaway also handles every moment and line nicely although if you dislike watching her cry on-screen you have ample reason to shun this film. As for the look of the movie cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt (""The Help"" ""Get on Up"") has created a handsome film even if its one that feels so managed and manicured you feel like the characters are walking through a high-end furniture showrooms display areas. Read More Oliver Sacks Awakenings Author Dead at 82 ""The Intern"" is a reverse-Frankensteins Monster of a movie smooth and scarless and seamless but lacking the voltage or spark of vitality that would make it come alive outside of the moments when De Niro and Hathaway are on-screen opposite each other. Considering the movies fortune-cookie-style ""insights"" that old and young have much to learn from each other its only appropriate that De Niro and Hathaways charms and those alone comprise the saving graces of ""The Intern."" After all its they not Meyers the director or Meyers the screenwriter who ultimately accomplish the task of pleasing the audience.

If youve seen Somethings Gotta Give Its Complicated What Women Want The Parent Trap or The Holiday--theyve collectively earned more than 1 billion worldwide so the odds are good that you have--youll undoubtedly have certain expectations of her latest and they will almost certainly be met. The Intern (not to be confused with the similarly themed 2013 Owen Wilson-Vince Vaughn vehicle The Internship) casts Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker a gruff but lovable 70-year-old retiree left at loose ends after the death of his wife. His days are bookended by morning Starbucks runs and frozen lasagna for one but yoga and Mandarin lessons and tai chi in the park dont adequately fill the lonely hours in between. When he sees an ad for ""senior interns"" at a booming e-commerce start-up in Brooklyn he applies and lands a plum spot as a personal envoy/errand runner/generational sounding board to Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) the stylish thirtyish entrepreneur who runs it all. Shes whimsical--we know this because she wheels around her loftlike office on a white bicycle and sometimes takes customer-service calls just to check in with her client base. But shes also overworked and overwhelmed by the conflicting demands of her family which includes a caustic mother a restless househusband (""they prefer stay-at-home dad now"") and a little daughter she hardly sees. Can Ben bring his gentle geriatric wisdom to bear on both sides and find fresh meaning in his own life at the same time? Can you order that couch from Anthropologie? By the end of two breezy if sometimes belabored hours the first question will be duly answered if not the second. The Intern skims both humor and pathos without ever quite settling on either; even in an apparent crisis the tone remains as plush and soft-cornered as one of Meyers ubiquitous throw pillows (though its also knowing enough to toss off a good joke about them). Hathaways take on the underwritten Jules is refreshingly unshowy but De Niro seems a little lost; his Ben is muted to the point of evanescence and a moment where he talks to himself in the mirror--hes been told that Jules distrusts anyone who doesnt blink--feels like a bizarro-world echo of his iconic Taxi Driver scene. Its like watching a lion whos been defanged and given a tofu bone to gnaw on. Then again asking for sharper edges in a movie that can hardly find a person of color in New York City--let alone a pigeon or a poorly situated apartment--is probably futile. Because its not actually New York were seeing at all. Its Nancys Narnia and as much a fantasy as she wants it to be.

Daily Edition Login to download The Intern Film Review 1100 PM PDT 9/21/2015 by Stephen Farber FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS High marks for Hathaway but the script wont pass muster. TWITTER Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro star in a workplace comedy directed by mainstream female auteur Nancy Meyers. Writer-director Nancy Meyers has scored a number of commercial successes (including Its Complicated and Somethings Gotta Give) by going against the grain and making movies centered on women and aimed at older audiences. These films have not always fared as well with critics as they have with audiences and you can expect the same divided response to her latest feel-good comedy The Intern. Box office should be healthy even though the movie offers more frustrations than rewards to discerning viewers of any age or gender. On the plus side the movie benefits from the casting of Robert De Niro and especially Anne Hathaway. And the premise has possibilities. Hathaway plays Jules Ostin a high-powered executive at a new fashion website and De Niro is Ben a senior intern hired to work for her after he rejects the idea of retirement. Fortunately there is no hint of romance between the two characters; its more of a friendship and professional relationship which turns out to benefit both of them. So far so good and the supporting cast is also appealing even if some of their roles are very thinly written. But theres a vacuum at the center of the film that becomes increasingly problematic Jules is at first reluctant to take on Ben as her intern but she quickly realizes his value so there isnt a lot of conflict to enliven this central relationship. This film bears a resemblance to Baby Boom a 1987 film co-written by Meyers and her former partner Charles Shyer. In that picture Diane Keaton was a high-flying executive whos forced to re-examine her priorities when she inherits a baby. But the movie was a lot funnier and sharper. One of its strengths was that Keaton played a more flawed character than the talented and vibrant Jules. In addition Keatons character had antagonists in a suspicious boss (Sam Wanamaker) and a sneaky co-worker (James Spader -- who else?). In The Intern Hathaways Jules doesnt really have anyone trying to challenge or undermine her and that means drama often is shortchanged. This film proves how political correctness can damage a movie. Baby Boom made the point that a demanding career can hurt the personal lives of women as well as men. But in The Intern Jules has a stay-at-home husband and an adorable daughter in addition to a stimulating career. Its all a little too perfect. There is one surprise twist in the third act that suggests her life may not be as ideal as she thinks. But even this stumbling block is resolved much too quickly and neatly. The whole movie is way too tepid to scintillate. Even the humor is a bit antiseptic. The funniest scene -- in which Ben and three of the other staff members break into the home of Jules mother to delete a message that Jules sent by mistake -- is basically an aside that has little to do with the films central storyline. Given the vacuity of the script it must be admitted that Hathaway achieves something of a triumph. Shes always engaging and keeps the character on a human rather than superhuman scale. De Niro has demonstrated his flair for comedy in such films as Meet the Parents Analyze This and The King of Comedy but this role is too constricted to allow him to break free. Hes been given a romantic interest in Rene Russo (wonderful as always) whos a more age-appropriate mate than Hathaway. She is still a decade younger than De Niro however and undeniably glamorous. Its interesting that the film rejects the idea that Ben might have a romance with a woman his own age. When such a character appears in the person of Linda Lavin she comes across as some kind of gorgon and sends him fleeing in horror. All of Meyers movies are technically polished. In this case the sets are cleverly designed by Kristi Zea while the music by Theodore Shapiro is gratingly schmaltzy. In the end an overdose of blandness sinks this middling star vehicle.

Pictures September 21 2015 | 1100PM PT Nancy Meyers smug workplace fable needs every ounce of Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niros combined star quality. Behind at least one successful woman stands an older wiser man. That at least is the chief takeaway from ""The Intern"" a perky generation-gap fable that sneaks some surprisingly conservative gender politics into its stainless new world of online startups and amply product-placed Macbooks. Starring Robert De Niro as the tirelessly benevolent retiree who becomes fashion entrepreneur Anne Hathaways unlikely guide to work-life equilibrium this is smooth white-linen entertainment unmistakably of a piece with the plush oeuvre of writer-director Nancy Meyers. Yet it takes all the leads considerable combined charm to forestall the aftertaste of the pics smug life lessons and near-comically blinkered worldview. Supplanting the romantic fizz of ""Its Complicated"" and ""Somethings Gotta Give"" with scarf-deep social engagement may cost Meyers latest a little at the box office but this ""Intern"" will still be reasonably well-paid by an under-served date-night crowd. ""Love and work work and love thats all there is"" intones 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker (De Niro) in the films opening voiceover -- vaguely quoting Freud but pinpointing the extended concerns of Meyers screenplay with ruthless accuracy. (An hour later one character will suggest changing the subject in a work-focused conversation. ""Marriage?"" another eagerly suggests. These are the options.) Marital stability and professional achievement are the two objectives by which ""The Intern"" defines its characters and narrative alike at the expense of any deeper personal or cultural interests; when Ben tells a date that he can summarize himself in 10 seconds the script gives us little reason to doubt him. For Hathaways heavily burdened career woman Jules Ostin on the other hand even 10 seconds of self-description is time she can ill afford to spare. The founder and president of About the Fit a Brooklyn-based online couture retailer in the mold of Net-a-Porter shes a Type A micromanager who has trouble leaving even customer service calls in the hands of her eminently capable employees. When her patient deputy (Andrew Rannells) announces that shes to be assigned an assistant via the companys newly-introduced senior intern program she takes it as a personal affront. Enter Ben whose affability and helpfulness are as consistent as the square charcoal business suits he wears every day. After trying out a host of hobbies and adult education courses to stave off the loneliness of spouseless retirement the former telephone-directory manufacturer (a pointedly analog career path) has come back around to the workplace Tai chi classes are all very well but cant verily be classified as either work or love. Hoping for a new lease on life from the fiercely young hip surrounds of About the Fit he arrives with rolled-up sleeves and a can-do attitude -- only to be brusquely ignored by Jules more frazzled than ever following pressure from investors to hire a senior male CEO for the company. By this point it cant have escaped viewers attention that Meyers has fashioned ""The Intern"" as something of a generational backflip on ""The Devil Wears Prada"" with the cannily cast Hathaway having graduated to the role of corporate fashion dragon. (Shes even permitted in a witty touch to toss her jacket at Ben in the blase manner of Meryl Streeps Miranda Priestley.) The difference of course is that Jules hasnt quite Priestleys time-hardened unflappability while De Niro is no hapless naif a la Andie Sachs The balance of authority between them is awkward from the get-go as Jules complains that her well-seasoned intern is ""too observant."" The turning point as in ""Prada"" is when home-work boundaries are crossed. Ben steps in for Jules personal chauffeur (her on-trend preference for cycling cited in introductory scenes is inexplicably forgotten) getting to know her young daughter Paige (JoJo Kushner) and affable stay-at-home husband Matt (deftly played by Anders Holm) in the process. Yet as Jules marriage rather than any workplace dilemmas becomes the focus of the drama ""The Interns"" superficially 21st-century outlook on age and gender takes on a more regressively paternalistic slant. Jules asserts that she can have it all but she requires an awful lot of mentoring from Ben -- whose professional and marital history is at least as he tells it wholly unblemished -- to get to that point. Theres not a lot of inter-generational exchange here as Ben arrives in the narrative with little to learn; beyond helping him set up a Facebook page Jules doesnt get to impart much perspective of her own. Before long Bens even monitoring her drinking with raised eyebrows She may come to call him her ""best friend"" (largely because theres scant evidence of any others) but the subtext is that its hard for a woman in her position to find support among her own. Certainly the films other female characters do little for its feminist credentials Jules fellow kindergarten moms are characterized as spiteful housewives while her mother (heard never seen) is a passive-aggressive needler. The great Celia Weston is egregiously wasted as a dippy elder intern while as the frisky office masseuse -- this is a Nancy Meyers film after all -- who embarks on a staid courtship with Ben fellow ""oldie-but-goodie"" Rene Russo has little to do but twinkle kindly from the sidelines. (Shes over a decade younger than De Niro but ""oldie"" status comes early in this world.) If older women get short shrift then their male counterparts are praised to the skies. Hathaway even gets to deliver a wince-worthy sermon to Jules cardigan-wearing twentysomething male employees -- themselves equally in thrall to Ben -- bemoaning the decline of masculinity and decorum in modern men. Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford (not to mention by implication De Niro himself) by contrast are held up as superior role models of ""cool."" This is pretty retrograde stuff and hardly plausible coming from Jules given her own husbands enlightened decision to give up his career for hers -- not exactly a maneuver from the Jack Nicholson playbook. At least theres a genuine crackle of chemistry between Hathaway and De Niro to sell us on their characters mutual appreciation Both actors can perform this kind of personality-led comedy on cue but also tease out unscripted hints of inner conflict when so inclined. Hathaway does particularly well in a role that frequently draws direct attention to its own unlikeability Both the steelier and more genial sides of the actresss signature class-captain charisma play persuasively into her business persona. Meyers detractors often cite her films narrow focus on a moneyed sliver of society and true to form the story world in ""The Intern"" could hardly be more homogeneous For a film set predominantly in Brooklyn the racial uniformity of the ensemble is regrettably striking. (Ben admits early on that he took Mandarin classes for a stretch; in Meyers vision of the Big Apple its hard to imagine what use he might have for them.) Though the pic is brightly shot by Stephen Goldblatt and scored with chipper deodorant-ad zeal by Theodore Shapiro its Kristi Zeas impeccable production design that again proves the most defining technical element of Meyers filmmaking. From the sharp white corners of About the Fits warehouse-conversion offices to the ivory calico textures of Jules gorgeously refurbished brownstone all ""The Interns"" interiors radiate a most exclusive kind of expense.

(Hey thats way too many quotation marks Will be changing the theme to exclamation points at this... point) This rant did more to inform me about Guy Lodge than it told me about the movie. This should never be the case. Now we are forced to look elsewhere in order to decide whether we want to spend our hard-earned slave wages to see ""The Intern."" I already did and the answer seems to be ""yes."" In case anyone was interested in the point of a review. Reply Absurdia says February 15 2016 at 937 am This was a solid review of a movie that should have been much better. The director Nancy Meyers not only copied music scenes and dialogue from other films she even recycled it from her own. Though Meyers at 65 years old still writes illogical unbelievable films about successful woman that appear to have no reality check from anyone with feet on the ground (""The Interns"" start up founder exceeds her 5 year goals in 18 months? ""Its Complicated"" owner has a bakery cafe the size of a museum then needs to double the size of her home after her grown kids leave?) she has a passive aggressive relationship with her own gender. She wrote Linda Lavins role as DeNiros neighbor as an unnecessarily crude obnoxious woman so Rene Russos decade younger match would have to win DeNiro by contrast. After wasting another welcome talent Mary Kay Place in ""Its Complicated"" she dissess her again by copying the use of her voice as the phone-in mother that she previously played in Nora Ephrons ""Julie and Julia."" And Meyers is so of touch with how to write inclusive plots (absolutely forget diversity) that she had the annoyingly precocious child mock people with bi-polar disorder in an effort to charm the audience. Plot devices appear and disappear in desperate patchwork story attempts Hathaway biking in a skirt and heels in the office not big enough to do so; DeNiro stating only to Hathaway and just once that he worked in the very same office space for 40 years; an entire break in scene with music copied not from an ""Oceans Eleven"" movie as stated in the dialogue but from Rene Russos heist in ""The Thomas Crowne Affair."" This was a great idea that could have been a much better movie with a different director at the helm. Reply Jim H Thorn says January 24 2016 at 315 pm We of the ""early bird"" sixty somethings. We enjoyed movie. We would like more and if a TV series came of it good. Reply Ellie Light says January 4 2016 at 516 am I loved this movie and detested this review. The only criticism I have is the protagonists choice to stay with a cheating spouse. In this sense she becomes an enabler like Hitlary Clinton and Camille Cosby. Reply Jhun Mandaraya says December 17 2015 at 235 am I am watching this movie as I respond to this post. I reached out to the Internet to try to make sense of what I am watching and this review I think comes close to the irritation this film gives me. I am irritated by the smugness (well put reviewer) that this film exudes through the first (at this point) 30 minutes. I dont like that the job and company in question has been romanticized. The movies lighting and agreeable chic set design gives the film a clean fresh look. The problem is that this modern layout with the cattle-call seating and the desks being set up as they are make for a frantic hyper pitched workplace. I know this because I work in tech in the SF Bay Area and these types of layouts are the bane of the scene here. The folks who made this movie have no idea how uncool this work environment is regardless of the lighting and pro set design. The romance is between Hathaway and the job/company itself. The movie is relentless in giving us the sense the the business is all important -- its quite ok that the owner of the fashion company is clueless because the business is running too fast. I wanted to watch this movie because of DeNiro and because I thought the idea was unique and hopeful in a way for a segment of American society that is undervalued. Bravo for this bit of the movie. But its still annoying despite DeNiro and to a lesser extent Hathaway (I agree that this is Devil Wear Prada with Hathaway as a less evil but still driven boss). I dont think Ill make it to the end; not feeling the directors snappy style and the clueless view of the tech scene. Brooklyn for tech? LOL PS -- just got to the heist section of the movie. L-A-M-E. I wasted 1 hour of my life that I will never get back. Good night all. Reply Jenifer says November 16 2015 at 419 pm What a dumb review. Films are not here to promote ""feminist credentials"". They are here for entertainment. Im tired of feminists and their nonsense anyway. So what if they mocked old ladies? Most women cant drive anyway. And yes I am female. Sheesh these reviewers with their libtard agendas These Days. Reply bert benedict says November 8 2015 at 615 am We loved it. Acting was great locations were neat and the story about friendship between those of different generations gives life lessons to all those who see it. Could it have been better? Maybe. The two stars develop a friendship based on love and admiration. The audience where I saw it clapped at the end. Reply Rupa says October 29 2015 at 910 pm Delightful movie thoroughly enjoyed it. DeNiros acting as usual in flawless...nice to see a picture that does not make you say....wait  what? ...very nice indeed Reply susan says October 25 2015 at 610 pm I found this movie to be a pleasure. It was fun and DeNiros comic timing was impeccable as always. As one who rarely finds humor in a movie I surprised myself by laughing from beginning to end.. Also as a ""young"" 66 year old female I did not dig deep into the movie just sat back and enjoyed the ride especially the juxtaposition of two generations.. Reply john says October 12 2015 at 944 am Very irritating movie to sit through. Very bad casting. A Person (kid) had their spouse screwing around and had connections lets make a movie Better to stand in the hot sun for a couple of hours than watch this movie. Reply Jeffrey Eisenmesser says October 5 2015 at 827 am Thank you. I left having confused mixed feelings. Youve analyzed/explained the lingering unpleasant aftertaste nicely. (I am 71.) Reply Caryynot says September 26 2015 at 619 pm Its a fun heartwarming movie. Stop being so heady. Just enjoy it. Real life is complicated enough Hey Elaine I hope you are over 65; if not that get to live to see65 If you have an open heart and an open mind you will be pleasantly surprised  Reply Akash Singh says September 25 2015 at 917 pm Its adorable and charming but thats about it. Reply Juhne Gable says September 22 2015 at 927 am It is great that a film critic especially with VARIETY can point out the ridiculous patriarchal stereotypes Hollywood loves to keep pushing year after year. Perhaps  at some point our films will grow up from the endless WOODY ALLEN Peter Pan mentality and become more mature like European films ? Thank you Reply stanjl50 says September 22 2015 at 836 am Given the obvious hostility of this reviewer to this film it must be a pretty great film to wind up with even a lukewarm positive assessment. It is rather pitiful that the reviewer cant keep even a childs level of self-control over his social opinions in his review of a film that sounds like it is attempting little more than being a piece of entertaining fluff. This reviewer should be fired since he obviously cannot provide any sort of balance in his reviews and doesnt believe in any diversity of opinions. Imagine the bias if there were any sort of political viewpoint in the film. Reply Snakebite Jones says October 12 2015 at 848 pm GMTA I saw The Intern today and enjoyed the movie from start to end. I laughed I cried and still am reflecting on how I was able to relate to the story. The DeNiro character was charming believable open hearted and wise. Hathaway played the part of a driven successful young woman who eventually valued what DeNiro character offered. No wonder the person who wrote this review couldnt relate. Reply john says October 12 2015 at 947 am Look in the mirror talk to yourself. Reply Blair says September 22 2015 at 1043 am Oh please. Reviews are opinion pieces albeit by well-schooled writers and should be taken as such. Give the political-correctness police routine a break -- saying he should be fired how ridiculous BTW I hate Nancy Meyers films too -- should I be led from movie theaters in chains and not allowed to comment on any films for a period of at least a year oh arbiter of others jobs??? Reply macd says September 22 2015 at 714 am Anne Hathaway is no Diane Keaton and DeNiro has been phoning it in for the past 20 years. Ill pass. Reply Elaine Rosen says September 22 2015 at 610 am hilarious 120 min funnier for the 65 plus crowd. Reply nuschler12 says September 22 2015 at 606 pm Elaine Rosen As a 66 y/o woman with a lifetime of experiences you will never get close to what a lousy comment Ive lived on a sailboat I rebuilt myself taught trauma medicine to the military served in Vietnam started up medical clinics on Indian reservations in rural areas and urban ghettoes. Ive been friends with folks who are Navy jet jocks and actually flew in an F-16 know most of the coaches and players in the NBA have four college degrees. Now what have you done Elaine Rosen? I havent had time to get to a movie for a year...but I like both Hathaway and DeNiro. So it is okay with you if I DONT like R rated frat movies or Game of Thrones? Reply Anonymous says September 22 2015 at 551 am Smug life-lessons near comically blinkered world view homogenous story worlds racial uniformity of ensembles (even in settings and locations that are extremely diverse in real life) could pretty much be the answer to Varietys hand-wringing cover issue from earlier this year - whats wrong with Hollywood? Reply Fred Hurt says September 22 2015 at 539 am Hey Guy. Brooklyn is racially diverse for sure but making a movie that focuses on a specific group is far from regrettable. If this was an all black or hispanic cast would you be calling it regrettably homogenous? As far as conservative values millions have them and while it doesnt make them right it doesnt make them wrong either. This review is ""progressively blinkered"". Reply Mr Model says September 22 2015 at 231 am ""Devil"" was filled with great bits of humor. But should have ended twenty minutes earlier when Anne Hathaway walked away. Anne should have tossed her cell phone into the fountain and become free at least that would have been a more emboldened more self-empowering ending. I suspect the author of these movies is never censored by those who work around her. Which is what I am reading in this review. I have no problem with the values being expressed. A nice change from all the wimpy men that seem to be portrayed in most movies these days. But a person with a deft pen and the freedom of censorship as well as being allowed to offer creative suggestions should have been employed to assist this movie author. You know kind of like ""an intern"". Reply nuschler12 says September 22 2015 at 614 pm Mr. Model Thank you Well stated. Id rather watch DeNiro than ANOTHER Seth Rogen movie..wow Reply See All 27 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO Boss Talks True Detective Season 3 Deadwood Movie...
