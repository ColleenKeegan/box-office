But theres often been a playful comic side to his films whatever their serious airs. Take a film like Frantic his 1988 dash around Paris with a frazzled Harrison Ford and a wild Emmanuelle Seigner and you can almost hear the giggles behind the Hitchcockian curtains. And 1992s Bitter Moon couldnt have been more ridiculously teasing in its charting of relationships between men and women. Even 1976s The Tenant a spooky study in racial tension and mental disintegration gave us Polanski wearing lipstick and a dress. Theres little more blackly comic than that.The sniggers from the wings continue with The Ghost an adaptation of Robert Harriss bold and enjoyable novel that balances political reality with trashy fantasy and which was inspired by the former journalists disappointment with Tony Blair. In Harriss hands Blair becomes Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) a slick but empty former prime minister facing trial for war crimes and hiding from the public glare in the United States. The similarities between Blair and Lang are pointed - but the differences are enough that Harris and Polanski get away with placing familiar characters in a tight and tense plot more wild than the dreary reality of high politics. The dreariness is left to the weather.Starting in a wet London we watch as a green writer (Ewan McGregor better than usual but struggling with an Estuary accent) is hired to finish Langs memoirs. The last chap died on the job so theres an ominous mood in the air as he travels to an isolated modern beach house in a windswept Marthas Vineyard and finds an air of deep discord. Langs wife Ruth (Olivia Williams styled with nods to Cherie Blair) is a quietly forceful but sad figure behind the scenes while Langs relationship with his assistant (Kim Cattrall) is causing tension. When Lang flies to Washington to try to rescue his reputation his ghost begins to uncover secrets which contradict the Langs version of their past and put him in increasing danger.Unlike say The Queen which delighted in the ordinariness of what goes on behind powerful doors Harris and Polanski delight in pushing their story beyond the bounds of reality - but never so far that the the film has no relevance. While Brosnans rictus performance is to be grinned at the fabric of the film is grey heavy and steely demanding that we share the ghosts fear and take his peril seriously. As a thriller the film is cold and lean and the photography and design convey a strong sense of isolation and a world gone wrong. There are terrific scenes not least one that involves a sat-nav guiding the action and the films moody opening and closing scenes are as striking as the image Polanski creates of a weather-beaten coastline seen through the glass wall of Langs office.Theres no escaping some laughable plot turns. Can you really unravel the CIA via Google? But the thread of black humour that runs throughout the film compensates for its occasional moments of madness. Its a film just silly enough to be taken deadly seriously.

Am I wrong in thinking that the Cherie character was in fact a CIA agent attached to NWO and that the PA was in fact his partner? Several comments point to this although I was so bored I can;t remember what they were.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 30 2012Bag of Angry PeasFeaturedSimply a piece of ill-considered and poorly-executed almost laughable trash. I purchased Harris book for a quid and felt ripped-off. Within minutes of finishing I had forgotten the plot entirely and sometime later was saddened when I heard it was to be made into a movie. Maybe a screenwriter will be able to turn this into something good I thought. Seeing it this evening on C4 I was further saddened to discover that they hadnt. There are uncanny similarities between the book and the film the first of which is that they both represent (I quote) a cure for insomnia. In the book the narrative is tedious the dialogue limp and the characterisations as real dynamic and exciting as an interesting accountant. Someone above compared the movie to a film students work. Any student producing this is deserved of a D followed by the red-penned footnote Could do better. My advice is not to not watch it but to try and block the existence of both book and film out of your mind forever.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 11 2011Peter KellowFeaturedMost of what has been written is true except I found this film very enjoyable. Love the atmosphere of the desolate modern house all the actors were good and Kim Cattral gorgeous. The plot moves along nicely and is enough to hang the incidental joys of this film on viz the flat grey light the pace the sense of the location. I have not enjoyed any Polanski film since Cul-de-sac probably because he needs a touch of black humour to be Polanski. The music and pace are integrally part of the film much as a Claude Chabrol film. The aesthetic pleasures of this film make it one I can watch over and over again. If like me you find the second by second experience of the script far more important than plot you wont see the ""faults"".

What was perhaps meant to be a slow-burning build-up of tension was just ponderous inept and hard to swallow. Poor script lousy direction no sign of an editor on the crew. Brosnans mid-atlantic accent not a small detail for a British prime minister. Ewans working class scribbler accent all over the place. Scottish would have worked... A couple of flashes of competence in the staging of the final few minutes of the film but really not worth waiting for. Really not.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 15 2010John ShieldsFeaturedThe only conspiracy worth talking about with regard to this conspiracy thriller involves the generally good reviews that the film has received. To start with the positives. Great soundtrack especially a bass rumbling that though a little obvious does a great job of racketing up the tension. In a theatre. The performance of McGregor also has a lot to commend it (compared to the others in the film) - he pulls off the Harrison Ford-like ordinary guy having one hell of day with a few Grant-isms so you know hes a Brit. Without this performance the film would certainly have fallen apart completely. Ok so thats the semi-positives over. Im going to ignore Bronsan who was poor but has such a minor part hes not really worth talking about. Instead Im going to launch myself at three different things 1. Olivia Williams. If you have to play the crying crocodile role and play the liar in the early part of the film when everyone thinks your a victim on the good side then there is one inveterate rule you HAVE to act as if this werent the case. You have to presume that the character is an excellent liar and trick the audience along with the other characters in the film. Taken at face value her acting in the first part of the film was SO bad that it was abundantly clear that she was acting badly on purpose. Bang goes the denouement. Poor storytelling. 2. Despite an undoubted sense of tension at times at others Polanski seems to have taken leave of his senses - protagonist killed off screen by a tragic deus ex machina with his key documentary evidence scattered to the wind on the street in front of the camera?? Come ON This is not the 60s. We live in an age of sophisticated artistic cinematography. Some of this film is worthy of an A-level student. And not a good one. 3. Final (major) gripe - the storyline is just abysmal. The bad-guys are not developed enough for us to care; the CIA plot is too preposterous for the relatively ordinary circumstances of the rest of the film and too complex for the kind of characterisation needed for a proper thriller - if youre going to have storylines like this then hand the clipboard to Emmerich. The film also relies far too heavily on what the makers supposed to be the inherent interest of the Blair-Iraq story - misguided given the lack of a proper part given to Brosnan and misguided given that if the majority of people had any real interest in the goings on of the Blair government British political history over the last decade would have been very different indeed. Its just not that interesting. Overall - poor imbalanced and rather dull.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 13 2010GoggleEyesFeaturedThe final scene of this film elicited a weary puff of laughter at how such an awful film can be so highly praised by so many. Ewan McGregor and Kim Catrill are as wooden as Thunderbirds puppets the story is just ludicrous and as stated above the facts being found out via Google (second search result no less) is about as lazy as one can get in terms of plot development.

However the ending which was left to the final paragraph bordered on brilliance. I went to watch the film particularly keen to see how this aspect was handled and although the rest of the film was thoroughly entertaining the ending was totally botched. I was surprised to learn on reading these reviews that the author collaborated on the scriptwriting which leaves me even more dissapointed. Those that have commented on the ending to the film are right - it was very poor particularly if you had read the book.

The ghost writer is given a London street accent the like of which youll never hear on a London street - its a strangled mangled Essex side emulation of a young Michael Caine that cringes every nerve. The ghost writer has total access to the Langs; whore holed up in the publishers Marthas Vineyard beach pad (actually shot on Sylt Island Germany cos Roman doesnt like the US these days). with a mix of round the clock CIA and UK security protection. Lang has been a good friend to the USA - the plot revolves around why this is the case - with several double blinds along the way the intrigue evolves at a nice pace throughout.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 16 2010DickyFeaturedThe month or two post Oscars always seem to be devoid of decent thrillers yet weaEUR(tm)ve had aEURoeGirl with the Dragon TattooaEUR and this.

In any case the film had all the right elements of a political thriller. It keeps you alert and curious to see what happens next. There are many twists and turns and although the ending came a bit out of the blue the film maintains a dignity and a continuous shock factor throughout.

Cmon people Plot spoilers ahead I know this is mostly to be taken tongue in cheek and Im a big big fan of Hitch... Why are Brits working covertly for the CIA? Is there a new Cold War no-ones told me about? And as Calhoun points out McGregors character finds all he needs to know on Google complete with video. Thats stupid Once he goes to see Tom Wilkinsons character game over - the CIA would be all over him Duh Why would he want to let Ruth Lang know what he knows on a slip of paper there and then? To be a smart-ass? Why? If they were going to rub McGregors character out why do it in public? Daft Why does a number 9 double decker bus keep whizzing back and forth in the London sections? Why is the dead guys stuff left intact in the house? If he knew what he knew theyd be all over that stuff. Silly Its not wry its a sub-standard Tintin adventure complete with quiff.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 05 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Ghost Writer Directed by Roman Polanski Written by Roman Polanski and Robert Harris Starring Ewan McGregor Pierce Brosnan Olivia Williams Classification PG Few will mistake The Ghost Writer for one of Roman Polanskis best films. But even second-tier Polanski is worth a first look and all his trademark themes - murder and menace exile and isolation abundant intrigue coupled to limited understanding - are fully on display here along with that unnervingly cold intelligence. What isnt is his usual pacing and flair for suspense. The result is a political thriller refreshingly long on grown-up dialogue yet lamentably shy on well thrills. This chatty thing does go on. As it does most of the violence occurs quite deliberately off-screen - its perpetrators are insulated from the havoc they wreak. So we dont see the death implied in the opening sequence but only witness the consequence Since the ghost writer of a political memoir has popped off in mid-task a replacement is needed. Cut to a fascinating scene of power-mongering in a London publishing house where the fat-wallet Americans run roughshod over their British equivalents and where a replacement scribe is hired. The new ""Ghost"" (Ewan McGregor) is pleased with the money but daunted by the job - hes got only a month to finish the book. The memoirist is Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) an ex-British Prime Minister bearing an obvious if somewhat contrived resemblance to Tony Blair - his tenure in office was spent cozying up to U.S. foreign policy (the source material is the Robert Harris novel). Now since the international court in The Hague is accusing him of aiding and abetting torture Lang has seen fit to remove himself to an island retreat off the coast of Boston. Yes hes been exiled to America - a plot twist Polanski would surely savour. So the Ghost flies to the island and its palatial bunker charged with upgrading Langs boilerplate prose into something remotely readable. There he interviews the once-great man himself finding him to be an unrepentant true-believer in the gospel of anti-terrorism. More surprising is the palpable domestic tension between Langs cerebral wife Ruth (a superb Olivia Williams) and his domineering chief-of-staff Amelia (a miscast Kim Cattrall whose unidentifiable accent is a bizarre mystery unto itself). Cue the intrigue as the Ghost discovers anomalies in Langs account of his political beginnings at Cambridge and later cycling through the pathetic fallacy of the islands constant rain he even starts to question the circumstances of his predecessors demise. Oh a storm is brewing. Cue the chatter too lots of it. When the dialogue is sharp and caustic - and the frustrated seductive Ruth benefits from the lionesss share of these verbal morsels - the picture gathers momentum. But when the talk is simply expository dredging up familiar bugaboos like the ever-nefarious CIA and a Halliburton-style conglomerate that dresses up greed as ideology the momentum dissipates the scenes grow windy and the movie stalls. And remains stalled until the climax pushes the restart button. But after all that waiting the ending feels rushed and unearned - too little happens then far too much. Like Jack Nicholson in Chinatown or Mia Farrow in Rosemarys Baby McGregor has the role of the blinkered protagonist in way over his head knowing more than he should but much less than he needs. This time though the script lacks the adroitness to bring the audience up to speed creating that suspenseful gap between what the hero doesnt know and what we do. To his credit Polanski doesnt stoop to easy genre cliches like transforming a mere scribbler into a macho firebrand blasting his way out of trouble. But avoiding cliches is one thing; finding effective replacements is quite another. Yes true to his character the Ghost stays thin and spectral. Unfortunately so does The Ghost Writer - it hovers for a while flirting with our interest prodding our fears then disappears without a trace. Nothing lingers not even a tremble.

March 5 2010 Starring Ewan McGregor Pierce Brosnan Kim Cattrall Olivia Williams and Tom Wilkinson. Directed by Roman Polanski. At the Varsity and AMC Yonge-Dundas Square. PGA note passes from hand to hand in a climactic moment of The Ghost Writer Roman Polanskis rewarding new drama. The scene is highly suspenseful yet it also prompts a wry smile.Yes Somebody please tell Martin Scorsese that this is the way you tip the hat to Hitchcock whose films smouldered more than they erupted.Article Continued BelowThe lightning crashes and bug-eyed hysterics of Scorseses recent Shutter Island represent the antithesis of The Ghost Writer a film that is as much a testament to Polanskis mastery of the slow burn as it is homage to Hitchs.Polanski is in total command of his medium something that hasnt been a sure thing since the 1970s The Pianist notwithstanding.Like that note carefully crossing the room he builds a film where revealed truth and rising dread are carefully brought together bit by bit. He surely connected with the storys twin theme of paranoia and politics Polanski finished this film while languishing in a Swiss jail awaiting potential extradition to the U.S. on an outstanding warrant over an unresolved 1977 child sex charge.Hes as much a prisoner of circumstance as is Pierce Brosnans Adam Lang a former British prime minister very much like Tony Blair who has exiled himself to the beach isolation and high security of an unnamed American coastal island (its Marthas Vineyard in Robert Harriss source bestseller; Harris and Polanski collaborated on the screenplay).Lang feels the need to set the record straight by means of an autobiography having sullied his reputation with too much involvement in Middle Eastern politics and too much trust in the U.S. president. But getting the word out is proving to be a dangerous occupation his first ghost writer is found dead - suicide is assumed - and the ghosts replacement nicely underplayed by Ewan McGregor is no sooner on the job when hes mugged on a London street.There are clearly people beyond book-club members who have an interest in Langs account but who are they and why should they care about the noodlings of an ex-pol?As the Ghost (hes never called anything else) assembles facts about Langs life trying to meet the hurry-up deadline of his publisher (James Belushi hilarious) he stumbles upon details that suggest dark secrets.Other complications are right in the open. Lang has two warring women under his roof his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) a dramatic type in dark robes who feels shes imprisoned upon Napoleons Elba; and his personal assistant Amelia (Kim Cattrall) who may possess a hotly beating heart under her icy demeanour.Speaking of icy Lang doesnt add up as a supposed man of the people. He apparently regards shaking someones hand as distasteful as being handed a dead fish. Whats with this guy?As Lang and the Ghost settle in for an uneasy collaboration the outside world intrudes by satellite TV news. A former cabinet colleague (Robert Pugh) alleges Lang sanctioned the treatment of prisoners in a manner the press and peace lobbyists are damning as war crimes.As an increasingly curious and emboldened Ghost strays from the Lang compound he meets people who add to the mystery an old man (Eli Wallach in a perfect cameo) and a university professor (Tom Wilkinson ever reliable) who in different ways let it be known that theres more to the Lang tale than the ex-PM is willing to tell.The creeping apprehension of The Ghost Writer continues as steady as the foghorn that sounds across Langs nearly deserted island. Yet Polanski unlike Scorsese never forgets that occasional humour helps build suspense.Unlike McGregors pen for hire The Ghost Writer is in no hurry to reach its conclusion preferring to revel in the delicious mystery that Harris and Polanski are spinning. This is a movie to savour like a good book. You dont want to miss revealing details that are like that suspenseful note carefully passed from hand to hand.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Ewan McGregor stars as the unnamed Ghost and Pierce Brosnan as Adam Lang the shifty former British prime minister whose autobiography he has signed on to salvage. The politicians first collaborator drowned accidentally before his draft was complete. Or maybe it was suicide. Or murder. As McGregors Ghost begins to probe into the events leading to his predecessors demise he realizes hes also in over his head. McGregor is great at looking anxious and well he might. ""The Ghost Writer"" is a one-stop anthology of Polanskis edgy themes. In just over two hours we get moral corruption violence voyeurism black comedy escalating claustrophobia and dagger-sharp cultural satire. Every aspect of the production from set design to casting to the unhurried deliberate editing hints at sinister secrets. The palette is exquisitely gloomy. Alexandre Desplats music recalls the nervous soundscapes of Bernard Herrmanns Hitchcock scores. Even performers in one-minute roles give their characters a suspicious aura. The publishing tycoon who hires the Ghost is excellently played by Jim Belushi an actor who projects the self-confidence of a rhinoceros and also the intellect. In a world where this man runs a media empire nothing good can happen. Most of the action takes place on wintry rain-swept Marthas Vineyard inside the publishers beach house which resembles a luxurious modern dungeon. The Ghosts assignment is too good to be true a quarter-million dollars for a one-month rewrite of Langs manuscript. The book promises to be a bestseller a boost to the controversial politicians reputation and a step up for the hired writer whose last effort was a popular magicians memoir called ""I Came I Sawed I Conquered."" But trouble begins for the ghostwriter as soon as he leaves the publishers office. Muggers clobber him stealing a document they mistake for Langs book. Outside the oceanfront compound angry protesters wave placards accusing the P.M. of war crimes; inside the atmosphere is tense. Langs arch intelligent wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) has spent years concealing damaging facts about her husband. Is she angry about his ill-disguised affair with his aide Amelia (Kim Cattrall) or something more? Everyone appears to know more than they let on. THE GHOST WRITER  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for language brief nudity/sexuality violence and a drug reference. Theater Uptown. The film is talky but the talk is very good as layer upon layer of intrigue lies and seduction -- sexual and intellectual -- build up. Polanski co-wrote the script with novelist Robert Harris and it is a model of economical construction. The plotting is airtight the mystery unfolds without cheap tricks or gimmicks. There is no tacked-on exposition no convenient coincidences and the back story is revealed by minute degrees. The Ghost is smart but no genius and what people tell him usually is a self-serving story that bears only a passing resemblance to the facts. As Lang Brosnan does the best acting of his career. The details of posture and expression are flawless. When hes introduced to the Ghost he looks directly into the camera at the audience. ""Hello"" he says tilting his head back and looking dismissively down his nose. ""Who are you?"" When they begin their interviews he faces the Ghost slouching on a sofa arms back and legs widespread like a seductive lounge lizard. Though hed clearly rather eat glass than be interrogated by this pipsqueak he slips into manipulative mode out of sheer habit. When hes hit by an indictment from the International Criminal Court for authorizing the kidnap and torture of terror suspects his sputtering rage is fearful to behold. If he returns to England hell be arrested so hes trapped in America under virtual house arrest. (Theres a blackly comic moment when his advisers go through the short list of other nations that dont recognize the court ""Iran North Korea parts of Africa."") Brosnan digs deep into the man creating a physical language that reveals as much as the dialogue how desperate his character is to be loved and respected. As you get to know the man your eye may fall on one of the blown-up bestseller covers that decorate the publishers villa. ""Love Worth Killing For?"" it asks. Be careful about leaping to conclusions though. The man who gave us ""Rosemarys Baby"" and ""Chinatown"" sees the universe as a place where easy answers dont apply and justice is rarely sure. The finale is a payoff to an almost subliminal sight gag Polanski has been working since early in the film. Its explosively funny yet blacker than printers ink. Polanskis sardonic vision always leads us to the tunnel at the end of the light. Colin Covert  612-673-7186 MORE MOVIES ONLINE Keep up with Colin Coverts posts at startribune.com/artcetera.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The Ghost Writer is a minor treat from a major filmmaker an entertainment put together with dark elegant confidence. Its not a work that needs to be reckoned with like 2002s ""The Pianist. If you boycott Roman Polanski on principle as is your right you can sleep untroubled by thoughts of the masterpiece you might be missing. Yet it has to be said Another director would almost certainly have bobbled this devilish mixture of paperback suspense political chicanery and jet-black comedy. In Polanskis hands its an unholy pleasure a diversion that stings.Adapted by the director from Robert Harriss 2007 novel ""The Ghost the movie concerns a hack writer played by Ewan McGregor - tellingly we never learn the characters name; like the heroine in ""Rebecca hes in thrall to people bigger than he - whos hired to ghost-write the memoirs of Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) Britains newly ex-prime minister. The previous ghostwriter died in mysterious circumstances his body washing up far from the ferry he supposedly jumped off.With four weeks to adapt the manuscript and Lang about to be subpoenaed by the Hague our Ghost is initially unwilling but the moneys good and the chance to sit at the power table is irresistible. Hes quickly installed at Langs residence-in-exile a swank high-tech fortress on Marthas Vineyard. (Due to Polanskis ah legal problems German locations convincingly substitute.) The vibe is nearly as gothic as Manderly in ""Rebecca complete with two Mrs. Danvers Langs trim all-knowing aide Amelia (Kim Cattrall in a neat career game-changer) and the ex-PMs tightly wound wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) who seethes at being miles from the action.""The Ghost Writer may be based on another mans novel but it has been expertly tailored to its directors abiding obsessions murder and mayhem just out of sight dark stretches of foreboding water a hero swimming farther out to sea hoping the sharks wont bite. As is usual with Polanski were meant to identify with the main character while groaning at his missteps; suspense here comes as much from the Ghosts pesky human flaws as from the evil forces he begins to uncover. (When in one key scene the writer looks at himself in the mirror and mutters ""bad idea you know hes going to go ahead with it anyway. Take it as you will but Polanski knows were slaves to our worst impulses.)Langs most controversial act as prime minister was allying himself with Americas wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - any resemblance to Tony Blair not coincidental at all - and the links between 10 Downing Street and US interests run invisible and deep. As the Ghost mines his subjects past in interviews and increasingly secretive fact-finding missions ugly truths gleam through the murk. ""The Ghost Writer is about learning to read between the lines of history and of other people and of other peoples manuscripts. That makes the film sound like a political screed when its anything but. Directing with deliciously cool flair Polanski stages the film as an uneven battle of wits between a terrier and a roomful of tigers. McGregor deftly manages to keep us on the heros side despite our misgivings - the Ghost has prospered in life because hes likably spineless - and there are choice turns by Tom Wilkinson James Belushi and dear old Eli Wallach frail but still noodgy at 94.The heart of ""The Ghost Writer though is the couple at its center. This Pierce Brosnan is a new one on me expansive dismissive charmingly cruel he wields power like a professional athlete. Adam Lang is Silvio Berlusconi in the body of Jack Kennedy; anti-war protesters are demanding the ex-prime ministers head on a pike and he shrugs them off like flies. The man was born to lead but in the name of what? One of the movies many grim jokes is that it doesnt really matter.For her part Olivia Williams takes back some screen real estate after a few too many mousy roles (the teacher in ""An Education being the latest) and one of the pleasures of ""The Ghost Writer is watching Ruth Lang reveal infinite sides to herself one claw at a time ignored wife frustrated insider forlorn lover and so on. The movie implies that only dullards like the Ghost have one persona and if they were smart theyd be content with it.The larger enjoyment of the movie is finding ourselves in the hands of a genuine filmmaker. How rare that is today - a director who simply knows where to place the camera for maximum unsettling effect who can coach actors to give their dialogue some topspin who shapes a sequence so that what we dont see is as important more important than what we do. Maybe this is a little like Bernini making a sculpture out of toothpicks but craft is in the making not the materials.That said you notice the toothpicks in the last few scenes of ""The Ghost Writer as the pieces of the puzzle fall tartly but not unexpectedly into place and matters come to an appropriately Polanskian head. The movies a light cruise to the dark side and it may be evidence that the directors brittle alluring pessimism has become so ingrained it doesnt bother him any more. ""The Ghost Writer takes place on the Vineyard and in London but its really set in Chinatown and Chinatown is where its maker has made his home.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

By David Denby Pierce Brosnan and Ewan McGregor in Roman Polanskis new thriller.   Credit Illustration by Andrea Ventura Why did Tony Blair in his ten years as Prime Minister do exactly what the White House wanted on so many occasions? Thats the juicy question buried in the depths of Roman Polanskis ""The Ghost Writer"" an extraordinarily precise and well-made political thriller--the best thing Polanski has done since the seventies when he brought out the incomparable ""Chinatown"" and the very fine ""Tess."" A few blogging goons have kneecapped the movie for not providing enough thrills but thats the wrong critical direction to go in. The director of ""Repulsion"" ""Rosemarys Baby"" and ""Macbeth"" long ago put away his knives. ""The Ghost Writer"" offers not the blood and terror of Polanskis early work but the steady pleasures of high intelligence and unmatchable craftsmanship--bristling hyper-articulate dialogue (the stabs are verbal and they hurt) and a stunning over-all design that has been color-coordinated to the point of aesthetic mania. Working with the British writer Robert Harris whose 2007 novel ""The Ghost"" serves as the basis of the movie Polanski fed the political material--troubling stuff about rendition and C.I.A. collaboration--into the mazy convolutions of a neo-Hitchcock story. He presents the entire movie from the restricted point of view of a likable young man a hard-drinking cash-poor writer (Ewan McGregor) who has been hired to finish the memoirs of Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) a former Prime Minister clearly modelled on Blair. The writer who is known in the credits as ""the Ghost"" (he is never named--the P.M. calls him ""man"") is not the first to work at this job. The previous ghostwriter has been found dead on a beach in Marthas Vineyard near the house of Langs publisher where the P.M. and his entourage have gathered to work on the book. The Ghost is in trouble from the beginning and he knows it but he needs money and self-respect and he forges on. The picture is set mostly in the United States but Polanski of course cant work here so he used the drab German North Sea coast as a double for the Vineyard in winter. The publishers mansion has the islands requisite gray shingles yet its not some gracious Victorian affair. Instead its a giant modernist shoebox with generous interior spaces and floor-to-ceiling windows that look out on dunes and a dark ocean. The interiors are all chic designer cement walls and flat or sharply angled surfaces; theres not a curve anywhere and hardly a cushion. This punitive luxury was created as a set (by Albrecht Konrad) at Babelsberg studio in Berlin and the views through the windows are either projections or digital reconstructions. Looking through those portals you appear to be seeing a movie of some sort a tone poem in gray that refuses to reveal its mysteries. The skies are ashen the rain never stops and the writer when he goes out on a bicycle for some air gets blinded by the wet. For us this mock-American landscape is a fascinating bad dream half familiar half strange. The cinematographer Pawel Edelman turns the constant downpour and gloom into a beautiful slate-colored curtain--or perhaps I should say shroud. Polanski wants an atmosphere of daunting indefiniteness a subdued but enveloping field of lies and secrecy impenetrable to the Ghost who is lost among power players far too clever for him. I dont know when Ive seen menace rendered with such delicate but persistent force. The P.M.s manuscript is also gray--maddeningly bland and opaque a veil of debonair evasion. As the Ghost tries to bring it to life allegations appear in the press that Lang when he was P.M. illegally turned over captured terror suspects to the C.I.A. for rendition and torture; a former minister from Langs cabinet even insists that his old boss should be tried by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Suddenly the house is besieged by antiwar protesters. Playing a powerful man in exile repudiated and hated by his own party and by many of his countrymen Pierce Brosnan gives the strongest performance of his rather lazy career. He doesnt imitate Blair; he offers his own interpretation of a public mans impersonally brisk and hardened charm--the smile is reflexive dazzling and savage. Lang tells stories about his youth with hearty indifference to their phoniness--even in retreat hes a calculating pol playing the angles manipulating his eager amanuensis. And when Lang is criticized or challenged in any way Brosnans charm dissolves into fury; he catches the defensive self-righteousness of power a leaders disbelief that anyone might be seeing through him. Brosnan is matched by the wonderful English actress Olivia Williams as Ruth Langs brilliant wife and longtime political adviser. Ruth has lost her husbands love--and more important his ear--and is taking it hard. Slender and tense with short dark hair Williams pulls her legs up under her chin as she sits in the discomforting house. (Her Ruth is so angular and hard-edged that she actually seems to belong in this place where its impossible to hide.) Williamss gaze could sear the fat off a lamb shank and her line delivery is withering yet Ruth is badly wounded and Williams makes her sympathetic--shes one of the rare actresses who seem more intelligent and beautiful as they get angrier. Polanski observes the character quirks the long-standing relations strained by the worsening disgrace of Langs situation--theres something we see in the frayed connection of husband and wife that could be more significant than hurt feelings. Tom Wilkinson and Eli Wallach (as a very old entirely sane hermit living on the beach) make strong appearances too. The only flaw in the ensemble is Kim Cattrall who as Langs assistant and mistress cant stop smirking (Cattrall lets us know that something dirty is going on). The movie is organically structured--nothing is overstressed but nothing is wasted either. The banal manuscript for instance assumes an almost totemic power as its read handled edited rewritten. It contains secrets finally discovered decoded. Life for the Ghost takes a dangerous turn when he finds evidence that Lang is lying about many things and becomes even more dangerous when Ruth climbs into bed with him. Ewan McGregors career got off track in ""Star Wars"" foolishness but this movie may put him back in good roles where he belongs. Hes such a charming actor--avid bright-eyed yet slightly acid and self-deprecating too. His writer initially no more than a sleepless overworked hack grows tired of being a ghost; he wants to be palpable a man and he asks questions of powerful people that could get him killed. Polanski takes care that the Ghosts story is never rushed mauled or artificially heightened--the usual style of thrillers now (see ""Shutter Island"" and every weeks buddy-buddy cop movie for the latest examples). Polanski respects physical plausibility and the passage of time; he wants our belief in his improbable tale just as Hitchcock did. There may be nothing formally inventive in this kind of classical technique but in the hands of a master its smooth and satisfying and I suggest dear reader that you gaze upon it because its all but gone in todays moviemaking world. Here it works its old magic. You understand at every instant what the Ghost feels and knows and you fear for him. Theres not much violence in the movie but your scalp tightens anyway. ""The Ghost Writer"" plays off the British publics disillusion with Tony Blair and the recurring complaints about Blairs alleged collaboration with the C.I.A. Yet when Lang is cornered by the Ghost the P.M. speaks with impressive conviction. In effect he defends the use of torture; he takes the Cheneyesque hard line ridiculing liberals who want safety and at the same time the luxury of high-mindedness. The answer to the question of why hes so acquiescent to the Americans is worked out in thriller (rather than policy) terms. Its the kind of supposition that may strike viewers here and in Britain as frivolous or just plain wrong but its a fine piece of mischief--suggestive wounding to Blair and as a fiction emotionally gratifying in the way of le Carres conspiracy plots. Brosnans performance is so forceful in the climactic scene with the Ghost that I dont think you could easily say where Polanskis own feelings about rendition lie. But I would guess that hes split in his personal sympathies--hes both the man accused of crimes and the Ghost longing to assert his full humanity. Polanski edited the movie while in jail and then under house arrest in Switzerland; the movies narrative of an exiled man trapped in a house overtook his own disordered life. He concludes ""The Ghost Writer"" with a twin flourish first a virtuoso travelling shot of an explosive note slowly but inexorably passed through many hands at a social occasion until it reaches its destination and then a final shot of Langs manuscript the fluttering pages now forlornly scattered about a London street. As in the famous last sequence of ""Chinatown"" Polanski is close to despair but his rejuvenation as a film director is a sign of hope.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> The Ghost Writer amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Defendor Alice in Wonderland >> The Ghost Writer When Roman Polanski was arrested last September he was in the middle of post-production on his latest this lean political drama about a scribe hired to shape the memoirs of a former British Prime Minister (Pierce Brosnan) about to be indicted for war crimes. No matter Polanski simply re-routed his office to the Swiss chateau where he was under house arrest. That the resulting flick turned out to be fantastic feels like a taunt but its truly just a very good director turning out a very good film as is his usual course of action. (Besides the real jab belongs to California Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza who insisted last month that Polanski return to the States for sentencing.) But lets turn attention to talents who deserve it--and theres a lot of them starting with writer Richard Harris who adapted his novel The Ghost into this moody callow thriller and star Ewan McGregor who follows up The Men Who Stare at Goats with yet another hapless innocent caught in an espionage snare. As the ghost writer or simply ""the ghost"" as he calls himself McGregor follows his agents command (and the quarter-million paycheck) to a remote island where Brosnan wife Olivia Williams and Brosnans assistant and mistress Kim Cattrall are hiding out from the media. Everyone wants a copy of Brosnans rough draft much to McGregors confusion--its as boring as a VCR manual. Even before he starts killing dull paragraphs the atmosphere is fatal; Brosnans last aide and writer recently took a deadly tumble off a ferry boat. But as the hawks circle Brosnans political career McGregor finds himself targeted by people with their own agenda. Within five minutes of signing his contract hes punched in the stomach and robbed. And from there the hits keep coming. Like the Swiss clocks that must have watched over his editing suite Polanskis flick ticks away relentlessly--at 128 minutes the film doesnt make us impatient for a second.

By Peter Rainer Film critic February 19 2010 Save for later Saved Actor Ewan McGregor appears in a scene from the Roman Polanski film The Ghost Writer. Kinowelt GmbH/Handout/REUTERS/          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Roman Polanskis deft political thriller ""The Ghost Writer"" based on the 2007 Robert Harris bestseller ""The Ghost"" is equal parts comedy and black comedy. Gracefully inexorably it goes from silly to scabrous. The film may seem insubstantial while youre watching it but in its own tingly deadpan way it has many of Polanskis trademarks a curdling cruel humor; an outsider hero who is also a patsy; and a pervasive dread.Ewan McGregor plays a character - nameless in both the book and the movie and listed in the credits simply as ""The Ghost"" - who is hired to ghostwrite the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) after his previous collaborator is found mysteriously washed up on the shores of Marthas Vineyard. Lang is encamped in a luxurious isolated house on the island while conducting a stateside lecture tour. This luxury is no match for the drizzly grayness of the location. As Langs tart wife Ruth (a first-rate Olivia Williams) puts it its like being exiled with Napoleon in St. Helena. A bigger storm brews when Langs former foreign minister (Robert Pugh) agitates in public for Lang to be tried in The Hague for colluding in the kidnapping of four Pakistani terrorists who were subsequently delivered to the CIA for torture. (One of the terrorists died.) While all this is going on The Ghost uncovers accidentally evidence left by Ghost No. 1 about Langs iffy past. He fears he will suffer the same fate as his predecessor. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? It would be a mistake to take this uniformly well-acted film seriously as a political ""statement."" Yes it features a nefarious corporation with a name that sounds suspiciously like Halliburton and Lang who is clearly based on Tony Blair is portrayed here as a mindless lackey of the Bush administration. And yet all this registers lightly. I suppose one could object to the issues of rendition and torture being employed in such a cavalier fashion but at its core ""The Ghost Writer"" is about The Ghosts tentative almost accidental skullduggery. He is the archetypal Hitchcock hero an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances. The entire political apparatus that surrounds him is a classic example of a Hitchcockian ""McGuffin"" - a great white shark that proves to be a red herring. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? It took me a while to decipher all the whorls and curvatures in the plot but I chalk that up to my ineptitude and not Polanskis. The film comes together in the end in a way that makes sense of everything that came before. ""The Ghost Writer"" is minor Polanski but its one of the rare thrillers these days that plays up to you instead of down. Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for language brief nudity/sexuality some violence and a drug reference.)

The Ghost Writer Good Director Roman Polanski. Cast Ewan McGregor Pierce Bronson Olivia Williams. Rating PG-13 for language brief nudity and sexuality violence and a drug reference. Note At Harkins Camelview 5. Can we help it? Probably not. Polanski who fled the U.S. in 1978 after pleading guilty to raping a 13-year-old girl is under house arrest in Switzerland while the U.S. moves to extradite him. And although theres nothing in ""The Ghost Writer"" that alludes directly to his case themes of isolation and paranoia permeate the film. Is that intentional on Polanskis part? It hardly matters. Whatever the reason Polanski stresses these elements theyre enormously effective in establishing the mood of what is a terrific thriller. Ewan McGregor plays a ghost writer for hire a position evidently so low on the literary food chain that the character isnt even given a proper name. His hard-driving agent (Jon Bernthal) scores him a lucrative gig taking over ghosting the memoirs of Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) a Tony Blair-like former British prime minister whos under fire for sanctioning human-rights violations involving the torture of accused terrorists. The ghost writers predecessor died under mysterious circumstances either having fallen or jumped off a ferry. The ghost soon finds himself on Marthas Vineyard in a beachfront compound heavily guarded by the sort of private security that seems more menacing than the official version. Thats not surprising given Langs controversial standing. Whats unusual is that the manuscript started by the previous writer is protected practically as strongly as Lang is. The ghost cant remove it from the premises; when the case against Lang heats up the ghost is ordered to leave his hotel and move into the compound with the rest of Langs retinue which includes his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) who was his inspiration to enter politics and his assistant Amelia (Kim Cattrall). The ghost is curious naturally. Why all the secrecy surrounding such a straightforward manuscript? He digs around a bit makes a chance discovery and begins to realize that he has signed on for a lot more than he realized. Polanski builds suspense slowly exquisitely. Its not a matter of shocking the audience although there are surprises but of creating an ever-growing sense of dread. Langs compound is a rainy dark place. The sun almost never shines there; instead gloom casts its shadow everywhere literally and figuratively. McGregor is quite good as the ghost a nice streak of self-loathing a sense of not being quite what he might be running through the performance. Despite this hes genuinely curious an essential trait for any good writer. Brosnan long past his James Bond days has ripened as an actor; hes outstanding. His Lang seems at heart perhaps a decent guy who long ago got in over his head. But it takes a healthy ego to become the leader of a country and Lang while outwardly humble isnt lacking in that department. Williams gives Ruth many layers. The long-suffering wife of a career politician she proves much stronger than we first suspect. Even Cattrall is good steely at first but ultimately in the dark as much as anyone else. (To the great surprise of ""Sex and the City"" fans she keeps her clothes on.) Tom Wilkinson shows up always a welcome presence as a Harvard professor loath to reveal anything about himself or his past - and with good reason. Wilkinson is as good an actor as there is working today; here in a small role he captivates (and disturbs) as a man who knows too much about nearly everything. Themes are explored specifically the publics relationship to terrorism and war and their cost. But in the end this is Polanski flexing his moviemaking muscle an expertly constructed thriller in the manner of Hitchcock where little is shown but much is conveyed. Even the chase scenes leave more to the imagination than most films and are more effective for it. ""The Ghost Writer"" fascinates through the final scene devastating but no more explicit than anything else in the movie. Whatever the audiences feelings about Polanski and his past in the present hes still operating at a level most directors can only aspire to. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

OLIVIA WILLIAMS stars in THE GHOST WRITER Photo Guy Ferrandis Summit Entertainment Review The Ghost Writer a waking nightmare 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Ghost Writer Drama. Starring Ewan McGregor Pierce Brosnan Olivia Williams and Kim Cattrall. Directed by Roman Polanski. (R. 128 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A tone pervades ""The Ghost Writer"" thats so precise and peculiar that it feels like the mark of a philosophy. This tone one of unease and distance tells of a modern world in which few things make sense and yet all things senseless and horrible can be reduced to petty human motives such as ego and greed. This tone also bespeaks a vision in which the most menacing people are sometimes the most ridiculous but their ridiculousness doesnt make them any less dangerous. It might even make them worse. And nothing is as it seems. Modern life is presented as terrifying yet completely absurd - as something to run from and laugh at simultaneously. Or to put it another way ""The Ghost Writer"" is a Roman Polanski movie. Completed when the filmmaker was 76 ""The Ghost Writer"" shows no decline in Polanskis powers no softening of his vision no turning away from the big canvas in favor of delicate miniatures. Indeed ""The Ghost Writer"" is one of Polanskis better films the work of a director in complete control and at the height of his powers. Every moment is invested with meaning. All angles compositions and shots work in the service of a mood and an idea. Once again Polanski is exploring the dangers underneath the smiling surfaces of civil life the way he did a generation ago in ""The Tenant"" (1976) ""Chinatown"" (1974) and ""Rosemarys Baby"" (1968). Back then he seemed like an eccentric but by 2010 standards hes practically a realist. ""The Ghost Writer"" - a fictional riff on recent events in British and American politics - denotes the moment in history when life became as nutty as a Polanski movie. The release comes needless to say at a peculiar time in Polanskis own life. This is the film the director was working on months ago when he was held in a Swiss jail and he continued to work on it while under house arrest at his Swiss chalet. As of this writing Polanski is still held up in court fighting extradition to the United States on a 32-year-old statutory rape conviction. But here lets just keep it to the movie. And what a movie it is Ewan McGregor plays a young glib best-selling author who is hired to ghost the memoirs of a former British prime minister (Pierce Brosnan). The memoirs in fact are almost finished but the previous ghostwriter has died (uh-oh). He washed up on the beach - either an accidental drowning or a suicide. McGregor as a sharp young man just trying to make a fast buck finds himself thrown into a strange insular environment within the PMs Marthas Vineyard compound. The PMs staff his wife (Olivia Williams) and his executive assistant/lover (Kim Cattrall) are all under one roof. So is the first draft of the memoir which for some reason cant be taken out of the building. Plus theres a bunker mentality The former PM is being investigated by the World Court for war crimes allegedly committed at the behest of the U.S. government. Robert Harris who co-wrote the screenplay with Polanski based on Harris novel has created a plot thats a sort of Tony Blair fantasia. The dark-haired outspoken wife is meant to evoke Cherie Blair. The conglomerate Hatherton suggests Halliburton. And Blairs good friend the president - ""why did he get mixed up with that damned fool in the White House"" - is meant to be George W. Bush. Polanski infuses the action with the quality of a waking nightmare. He has the capacity to take a simple shot of a ship coming into harbor and give it a feeling of foreboding. His technique in ""The Ghost Writer"" is a strong argument in favor of using extended shots and precise angles as a means of creating tension as opposed to the more modern tendency to cut fast and keep the camera in constant motion. Even as Polanski follows the ghostwriter and involves us in the characters terrors he deliberately creates a distance as though reminding us that this story is really nothing unique just the world we live in. Alexandre Desplats cheerful musical score which sounds like something for a 1960s romantic comedy is in sync with Polanskis vision. It keeps pulling us back too inviting us to watch from a critical distance. Some will notice the unintentional parallels between Polanskis current situation and that of the prime minister in the film - both subject to legal proceedings both restricted in their travel both holed up in a beautiful place in a country they cant leave. This is no way to watch movies but such thoughts do creep in. Heres another thought This old man who cant leave the house has just made the first important film of 2010. -- Advisory The film contains sexual situations and violence.

(Guy Farrandis) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 26 2010 ""Im your ghost"" announces Ewan McGregors character in ""The Ghost Writer"" in which he plays a steadfastly anonymous young author assigned to pen the memoirs of a retired British prime minister. Indeed there are hauntings aplenty in this sleek masterful thriller that recalls such classics as ""All the Presidents Men"" and the more recent ""Michael Clayton"" in its pared-down paranoid style. Like an expert driver behind the wheel of a purringly expensive automobile director Roman Polanski invites viewers to settle back and simply enjoy a ride whose sinuous curves he navigates with supreme assurance and skill -- banishing at least for the moment thoughts of the skeletons that haunt his own life. This StoryThe Ghost Writer A master of sleek suspenseWatch Ghost Writer trailerFind showtimes The Ghost as McGregors protagonist is called has taken on the memoir project after the first authors mysterious death. The day the Ghost seals the deal hes whisked to an island off Massachusetts where former prime minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) lives in an elegantly appointed concrete bunker with his wife (played with biting asperity by Olivia Williams) and a staff of comely assistants led with velvet-gloved authority by Langs personal aide Amelia (Kim Cattrall). As the Ghost sets to work on the project he realizes that Langs distant reticence a tight deadline and curiously tight security around the project will be the least of his problems. Its difficult to overstate how good ""The Ghost Writer"" is if only because the things it does well are so simple Working with co-writer Robert Harris here adapting his own novel Polanski smoothly threads viewers through a story that on paper might seem ludicrously contrived but that with his exacting execution comes alive with flawless detail convincing performances and an uncanny prescience. (Lang is clearly based on Tony Blair but the film also evokes the spirits of Bill and Hillary Clinton Dick Cheney and such private enterprises as Halliburton and the Carlyle Group.) From the chic austerity of the Langs undisclosed location to the gradually revealed nexus between academia politics and corporate influence ""The Ghost Writer"" offers an unusually astute glimpse of power at its most alluring and corrosive. Unlike ""Shutter Island"" another stop on this seasons archipelago of island-based thrillers ""The Ghost Writer"" leaves viewers with all the right questions.  1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains profanity brief nudity and sexuality violence and a drug reference. 130 minutes. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  A master of sleek suspense Watch Ghost Writer trailer Find showtimes",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/25/AR2010022501840.html,200,theghostwriter11,theghostwriter,washingtonpost

Theres no deep subtext here just a page-turner turned to the screen (Robert Harris adapting his own best seller) with trenchant performances and evidence of a dark - very dark - wit. Loaded with Hitchcockian hugger-mugger this is a genre Polanski clearly revels in.Ewan McGregor is the unnamed hero or sap of the tale a cocky journalist who accepts a fat paycheck to punch up a bland memoir by former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). The first ghost writer had no sooner finished his manuscript than he turned up dead on a wintry Marthas Vineyard beach - not far from where Lang his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) and a team of aides have been camping out in a modern box of a house. (The film was in fact filmed in northern Germany with towns and roadways cars and ferries refitted with Yankee signage.)If the Langs bear more than a passing resemblance to the Blairs - as in Tony Blair and Cherie Booth - thats no coincidence. And the scandal that comes raining down on Lang - that as prime minister he was party to war crimes in Iraq and was a willing dupe of the United States - mimics charges that have been leveled at Blair.But as for the rest - a twisting knot of intrigue involving break-ins stolen documents bodyguards car chases hidden messages the CIA and pulse-pounding Google searches - its all merrily sinister cloak-and-dagger stuff. The plot thickens and McGregors wordsmith holed up in the isolated Lang compound (or in a comically deserted nearby inn) hunts for clues. He bicycles through wicked rain to find witnesses who saw his predecessors body washed up on the shore. He rifles files (paper and electronic). He gets intimate with his subjects wife Ruth.And Williams (the teacher who counsels Carey Mulligan in An Education) is terrific here. Ruth is acerbic aloof calculating vulnerable. With her husband distracted by political calamity a publisher hungry for his tome and the amorous attentions of his personal assistant (Kim Cattrall deploying a clipped convincing British accent) Ruth sets out to seduce the visiting writer. This in fact she does.""The modesty of the morning after"" she deadpans to McGregor the next day as he hurries to throw on some cover in the wake of their bedroom tryst.The Ghost Writer is beautifully framed and shot (by Pawel Edelman). Tom Wilkinson John Bernthal Timothy Hutton Jim Belushi and Eli Wallach have small memorable turns and the music by Alexandre Desplat (Oscar nominated for Fantastic Mr. Fox) is rife with plucky tension.To compare The Ghost Writer to earlier more substantial Polanski fare - Chinatown Rosemarys Baby - is to play a meaningless game. Its like comparing early Dylan to his latter-day recordings. But Polanski who edited the film while under house arrest in Switzerland and fighting extradition to the United States has produced a neat and humorously nasty noir. His film doesnt demand much from the viewer but its smart dialogue nimble syncopations and tricky suspense are - while youre there in the theater in the dark - thoroughly satisfying.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Comments (1) click to enlarge The Ghost Writer Video Rated PG-13  128 minutes  2010 Because this suspense film was directed by Roman Polanski and centers on a character whos fighting extradition for past crimes its bound to get more serious attention than it deserves. A successful ghostwriter (Ewan McGregor) is hired by a New York publisher to spice up the dull memoir of a former British prime minister (Pierce Brosnan); after the writer takes up residence at the politicians U.S. retreat the International Criminal Court orders the PM to stand trial for having handed over terror suspects to the CIA for rendition (i.e. torture). This is a polished palatable intrigue with a knockout performance from Olivia Williams as the PMs hardened wife and a highly persuasive one from Kim Cattrall cast against type as his buttoned-up personal assistant. But the mystery is unraveled a bit too conveniently and the fatalistic Chinatown ending feels more rehearsed than revelatory. Among the able supporting cast are Tom Wilkinson Timothy Hutton Jim Belushi and Eli Wallach. By J.R.

(Handout) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday February 18 2010 458 PM Title The Ghost Writer It may be about a man whos accused of serious wrongdoing and forced to live in exile but dont look for autobiographical insight in Roman Polanskis ""The Ghost Writer."" The story was inspired not by Polanskis own legal troubles but by the notion of behind-the-scenes machinations within the Blair-Bush administrations.Pierce Brosnan plays the Tony Blair stand-in former Prime Minister Adam Lang. The titular author is Ewan McGregors nameless biographer who has just been hired to ghostwrite Langs memoirs. Our immediately endangered hero cant hear the creepy score and doesnt appear suitably concerned about the ominous rain that beats down incessantly on Marthas Vineyard where Lang is living. (The movie was actually shot in Germany a safer haven for Polanski.)But its not long before McGregors Ghost as hes called begins to wonder if somethings amiss. After all hes been hired because his predecessor mysteriously drowned. Plus Lang is accused of encouraging torture and faces arrest if he returns to England. Then theres the fact that Langs imperious assistant (Kim Cattrall) has gotten a little too close to the boss which seems to be angering his wife (Olivia Williams) to a dangerous degree. Despite the packed plot adapted by Polanski and Robert Harris from Harris novel -- the pacing feels oddly slack. And the performances are all over the board Brosnan knows just how to make the most of his slick good looks but the villain overacts to such a degree that viewers will be alerted long before the final twist. Still McGregor turns in his best work in recent memory and Polanskis an expert at building the sort of intense atmosphere that leaves his audience in a state of edgy paranoia. Its a safe bet youll be looking over your shoulder when you leave the theater to head home.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"The Ghost Writer reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Ghost Writer reviewed. The Ghost Writer reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 19 2010 1141 AM The Ghost Writer Roman Polanski has made a great thriller--damn it. By Dana Stevens The Ghost Writer Theres an odd synchronicity between the two big film releases of this week Martin Scorseses Shutter Island and Roman Polanskis The Ghost Writer (Summit Entertainment). Both are directed by men who were titans of the resurgence of American-made film in the early 70s. Both movies are thrillers about young men who become entrapped in webs of paranoia and deceit while stranded on islands off the coast of Massachusetts. And both are films that hark back in precise and deliberate ways to earlier chapters of cinematic and political history the Cold War years in Scorseses case and the post-Nixon era in Polanskis. I wish I could say that the movie made by the man who didnt allegedly sodomize a minor and then spend 30 years evading sentencing was the better of the two. But the fact is Shutter Island is a disappointment incoherent and strained while The Ghost Writer is a triumph elegant accomplished and (this is the hardest part to admit) occasionally even wise. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. With its slow but taut pacing and muted tone The Ghost Writer evokes the feel of 70s classics like The Conversation or Polanskis own Chinatown.But rather than sampling and remixing these movies in the breathless avid postmodern style Polanski remembers them--what they felt like and why they mattered. The principal character whos never given a name is played by Ewan McGregor. (A generation ago Michael Caine would have played the role.) Hes a skilled ghostwriter (and its implied a failed novelist) whos brought in to whip into shape the impossibly dull memoir of a former British prime minister in time for publication. The previous ghostwriter died before the manuscript was finished drowning off the coast of the island where the politician Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) lives with his brilliant frustrated wife Ruth (Olivia Williams). The Ghost takes the job unable to resist the 250000 paycheck. But the check comes with strings attached--so many strings that the Ghost is soon desperately entangled in the Langs political and marital quagmires. Advertisement Holed up at their stark modern beachfront property (whatever house plays the house should win the Academy Award for best house) the embattled Langs watch on cable news as a political enemy implicates Adam in a torture scandal and the International Criminal Court threatens to prosecute. The Ghost at the Langs behest writes a press statement on Adams behalf--at which point as hes sweetly informed by Adams personal assistant and mistress (Kim Cattrall) he becomes ""an accomplice."" The disgraced PMs resistance to extradition and his equivocal justification for his past actions cant help but remind us of Polanskis own legal and moral limbo but the analogy isnt pushed too far (audiences that want the film to be a mea culpa for the filmmaker will say it isnt pushed far enough). The intrigues suspense and reversals that follow this setup are best left to unfold at their own stately clip. Polanski collaborated on the screenplay with the mystery writer Robert Harris who wrote the novel the film is based on and Polanskis signature elements are all here the plausibly tightening web of coincidence the sense of constant low-level menace and the mordant humor. Theres a marvelously satisfying sequence that uses a cars GPS device to advance the plot with an economy that would have had Hitchcock clapping his hands in delight. The casting is note-perfect with one big blond exception Kim Cattrall. If this were a silent movie Cattrall would be fine--she certainly looks the part of the icy hyperefficient personal assistant--but her stab at a British accent is 10 degrees short of half-assed and all you can think of as she purrs her lines is Samantha ordering a second Cosmo. Everyone else in the cast down to the unknown actors who play the Langs domestic staff seems born to play just the role they have. Pierce Brosnan in particular is an inspired choice to play a slick shallow actor-turned-politician whos half Reagan half Tony Blair. When Eli Wallach now 93 shows up in a tiny part as the local who warns the Ghost about the sketchy circumstances of his predecessors death you dont think ""Cool a cameo by Eli Wallach"" You think what an eerily fascinating old man that is. The composer Alexandre Desplat is on a tear. In the past year he has scored three terrific movies ( Fantastic Mr. Fox A Prophetand this one) and two more that whatever you think of them were musically memorable ( Julie amp; Julia and The Twilight Saga New Moon.) His music for The Ghost Writer full of Bernard Herrmann-esque arpeggios and tinkling bells is at once witty and genuinely suspenseful. Its one of the best things about the movie. Advertisement Im getting tired of saying nice things about The Ghost Writer so Ill throw in a quibble The denouement in which the Ghost learns just how high the conspiracy goes pivots on a plot point that feels over-elaborate and contrived. But the very last shot--perhaps the best last shot of a movie since Before Sunset--redeems everything. Except of course for Roman Polanski himself.

Paramount Pictures By John Anderson Updated Feb. 19 2010 1201 a.m. ET Like an unassisted triple play or a blue moon the release Friday of films by both Martin Scorsese and Roman Polanski seems to demand some kind of acknowledgment. If nothing else the coincidence dispels some suspicion that movie studios are in collusion Both Mr. Scorseses ""Shutter Island"" and Mr. Polanskis ""The Ghost Writer"" are likely to appeal to the same audiences of people who crave fiber in their movie diet who have followed their careers since American cinemas ballyhooed renaissance of the 70s or who simply consider them two of the more interesting filmmakers of their generation. Mr. Scorsese is 67 Mr. Polanski 76 a fact which should confound the numerologists. The rest of us will have enough of a time wrestling with the films. Shutter Island Watch a clip from ""Shutter Island"" about a woman who escapes from a mental institution; starring Leonardo DiCaprio Mark Ruffalo Ben Kingsley and Patricia Clarkson. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. In ""Shutter Island"" Mr. Scorseses 21st narrative feature and his most enigmatic the director has made multiple movies from Dennis Lehanes best-selling novel of the same title The one you see the first time and the one(s) you see the second. Such claims can be made about other films of course--Hitchcocks ""Vertigo"" for instance which the Mr. Scorsese refers to here more than once. But for all the immediacy and seemingly disposable pulp in its fiction ""Shutter Island"" requires multiple viewings to be fully realized as a work of art. Its process is more important than its story its structure more important than the almost perfunctory plot twists it perpetrates. Its a thriller a crime story and a tortured psychological parable about collective guilt. But in the end ""Shutter Island"" is the cinematic equivalent of a Joseph Cornell box a world of appropriated ingredients given new meaning through their combination and juxtaposition. It wont be a beloved movie. It will inspire doctoral dissertations. And while this news may not bring unbridled joy to the folks at Paramount Pictures let them be consoled by the thought that it possesses a kind of obsessive perfection. Which is not to say that there arent satisfactions to be had on a single trip to ""Shutter Island"" which boasts a spectacular cast that includes Ben Kingsley Max von Sydow Emily Mortimer and that goddess Patricia Clarkson. From the slap-hammer opening credits this is a movie in a mood. Imagine walking into the middle of someone elses family fight. Youre not quite sure why the atmosphere is so fraught with hysteria but you sense that its safer not to ask. The year is 1954 the day is gray the heaving water on Boston Harbor looks as welcoming as a grave. U.S. marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (the eminently watchable Mark Ruffalo) are aboard a patrol boat heading to Ashecliffe Hospital a facility for the criminally insane where a patient named Rachel Soldano has apparently executed a Houdini-like escape from her windowless cell. Having murdered her three small children the cops are told she has never accepted the deaths or the fact that shes imprisoned in the ghastly Ashecliffe. She thinks shes living in the Berkshires. Perhaps shes just gone for a hike. And taken reality with her. Teddy is officially on Shutter Island to find Rachel but hes arrived with another agenda Human experimentation has taken place there and he intends to crack the case wide open. But who is and isnt cracked becomes harder and harder to determine as Shutter Island wraps itself around him. More Speakeasy Shutter Island Review Revue Ewan McGregor on Playing a Part for Polanski Dennis Lahane the Author Who Aced Hollywood Speakeasy Scorsese on the Difficult Shutter Island Shoot The plots dry bones which in his novel Mr. Lehane seems to have exhumed from the more hardboiled and allegorical B-movies of the 40s and 50s are just that a skeletal frame over which Scorsese can drape a garment woven from the accumulated knowledge of his lifetime as a movie watcher. You can see why he wanted to make this film Its a story begging for visual layers. From the Hitchcockian back projections against which Teddy and Chuck are framed to the kind of shadowy elegance found in the work of 40s producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur (""Cat People"" ""I Walked With a Zombie"") Mr. Scorsese is accessing all the macabre thrillers he has in his head. To catalogue them here wouldnt just be pretentious it would be impossible. The director is working as he has three times previously (in ""Gangs of New York"" ""The Aviator"" and his Oscar-winner ""The Departed"") with Leonardo DiCaprio who has never seemed so substantial. Hes thickened a least for this role which calls for him to be both hardened and tenderized like a cheap steak under the meat mallet. Life has been a nightmare for Teddy and a recurring one. Almost immediately after his arrival on Shutter flashbacks begin both of his dead wife (a terrific Michelle Williams) and of the liberation of Dachau where he remembers slaughtering Nazis. The question most people will want answered is does it work as a thriller? And the answer is sort of. Everything is overwrought notably the engorged dialogue by screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis crafted out of Mr. Lehanes film-noirish patois and the music which may lack the specific gravity of a Bernard Herrmann score (like the one he did for ""Vertigo"") lingers in the mind like the films ever-present cigarette smoke and mood of anxiety. Take the use of Mahlers Quartet for Strings and Piano in A minor. It functions here on two levels. Only the first movement has survived so the presence of a fragmentary work by an Austrian Jew is an oblique comment on the storys fractured characters. In addition it embellishes Mr. Scorseses vision of Dachau--here filtered through Teddys tortured viewpoint--in which winter has turned a death camp into a frozen tableaux of permanently lovely children and the dead flow from freight cars as if from a fountain. Not since ""Raging Bull"" has Mr. Scorsese so brazenly married brutality to beauty. Not since ""Kundun"" has one of his films felt so aspirational. The Ghost Writer ENLARGE Ewan McGregor assists a former prime minister in The Ghost Writer. Summit Entertainment Adam Lang the former British prime minister portrayed by Pierce Brosnan in ""The Ghost Writer"" cant leave America. Having played lapdog to an unnamed American president hes been indicted the International Criminal Court for crimes that involve illegal renditions and torture. So if he wants to avoid arrest hell have to hole up in some rogue state that doesnt recognize the ICC--Iran perhaps or North Korea or more likely the U.S. Rare will be the viewer not looking for ironies in ""The Ghost Writer"" and finding them. Start with the plot with its inescapable echoes of Mr. Polanskis own situation. The point is theres really no agenda in Mr. Polanskis film except as regards secret governments the CIA the accommodations that the powerful often make to immorality and the telling of an exhilarating intelligent character-driven tale of political intrigue. Compared to ""Shutter Island"" Mr. Polanskis film (adapted from a novel of the same title by Robert Harris who co-wrote the screenplay) practically comes with a GPS system. Like the other film ""Ghost Writer"" begins with a boat docking--albeit without its key passenger a writer and personal confidante of the former prime minister whos been helping Lang write his memoirs. After the scribe washes up in the Marthas Vineyard surf a replacement ""ghost"" (Ewan McGregor) is hired handed a brutal deadline and the task of translating Langs stultifying memoir into commercially viable prose. Then all hell breaks loose as the World Court prepares to prosecute and our ghost discovers far more about his collaborator and his predecessor than is good for his health. Mr. Polanski is a magician his movie a synthesis of Mr. Harriss sturdy narrative a Mamet-like appreciation for the shadows that lurk between words and a drollery that most directors wouldnt even think about attaching to a thriller. But ""Ghost"" is far more than a suspense film and its cast is a cache of jewels--the most glittering of which is Olivia Williams who in a virtuoso performance as Langs wife Ruth creates a character who defies all casual adjectives. Manipulative? Macbethian? Clintonian? No Ruth Lang is sui generis a sexy/fearsome teeth-baring seductress who when not simply radiating intelligence is disposed to stalking the dunes in a cowl that makes her seem like the French Lieutenants Woman crossed with Hillary Clinton. Ruth suppressed her own political career for the sake of her husbands and because shes just barely of an age when such sacrifices were expected shes all the more bitter for it. Adding to her angst is her husbands in-house mistress the provocatively named Amelia Bly. Amelia is played by a Kim Cattrall who is virtually unrecognizable partly because shes so good. Who knew there was such subtlety behind Samantha Jones? And yes the boys are good too. Spectacular actually. Mr. McGregor is a remarkably versatile player and Mr. Brosnan while not mimicking Tony Blair in any way does nail the type of man for whom authority has become a casual vice. (During a press conference Lang lapses into Churchill and its hilarious). Add Tom Wilkinson as a dubious academic and Robert Pugh as one of Langs political rivals and ""The Ghost Writer"" is so rich you may feel you paid too little for your ticket when the whole thing meets its very Polanski-ish climax.

DVD Focus ENLARGE Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Cinema (1995) ""Shutter Island"" takes a film trip of its own but this is the officially sanctioned guided tour as hosted by its director timed to help celebrate the 100th anniversary of the movies. Surveying a centurys worth of cinema the director examines the creative process narrative and film technology and offers his appreciations of those who most influenced him. As someone who can access a film-school-thesis-worth of movie information in the course of a cocktail-party conversation Mr. Scorsese is the perfect host on his favorite subject. ENLARGE Roman Polanski Wanted and Desired (2008) The likely cause of Mr. Polanskis current trouble--he remains under house arrest in Switzerland as Los Angeles County tries to extradite him--Marina Zenovichs documentary chronicles the heartbreaks and tragedies of Polanskis life including the murder of his pregnant wife actress Sharon Tate by the Manson family. But it also suggests quite strenuously and effectively that the original judge and prosecutors in the Polish-born directors sex case reneged on the plea deal theyd had with the accused prompting him to flee the country. ENLARGE Titicut Follies (1967) The venerable Frederick Wiseman master of fly-on-the-wall nonfiction cinema shot this unforgettable documentary at the State Prison for the Criminally Insane in Bridgewater--which like the fictional Shutter Island was in Massachusetts. A judge there banned the film in 1968 citing concern for patient privacy (and making it the first movie banned in the United States for reasons other than obscenity morality or national security). The decision was reversed in the early 90s. The title by the way comes from a talent show put on the inmates whose treatment by the commonwealth was something less than luxurious. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

""The Ghost Writer"" is a movie about systemic lack of respect for women and the urgent need to extradite criminals. And guess who directed it? Roman Polanski you are the mayor of Chutzpahtown. Easily losing the race to be the best Massachusetts-island-based film noir of the week this corny paranoid thriller takes place on an unnamed Marthas Vineyard-ish offshore community. Here a ghostwriter (Ewan McGregor) is helping construct the memoirs of a former British prime minister (Pierce Brosnan) named Adam Lang though he might as well be called Bony Flair. Lang is forced to cool his heels in the US because it doesnt recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague which is about to charge him with war crimes. This American lapdog even has a Cherie Blair-look-alike wife (Olivia Williams) and a meeting with a Condi Rice doppelganger at the State Department. The movie is rendered one big double-entendre by the leisure pursuits that have made Polanski a fugitive for more than 30 years. ""Cheeky bugger"" exclaims Lang when he learns his own foreign secretary is going to rat on him. Takes one to know one Roman. When Williams gives a speech about how women are disrespected one pictures Polanski behind the camera chatting about his feminist principles with a young assistant whom he then invites out for a drink. Perhaps she would join him for a juice box during recess? Although the movie is reasonably suspenseful for a while and has a few witty moments (of a first draft the ghost says ""All the words are there. Theyre just in the wrong order"") it rings false. Timothy Hutton as a guy named ""Sid Kroll""? Warning Kim Cattrall tortures a British accent Tom Wilkinson throws in a pinched try at an American one and Brosnan makes a pass at sounding . . . I have no idea. Scottish? At a ticket window for a Massachusetts ferry the clerk offers ""Single or return?"" instead of ""One-way or round-trip?"" The larger picture grows as sloppy as the details. It takes the movie more than an hour to establish whats obvious to the audience from the start -- that the ghostwriters predecessor was murdered. And it does so awkwardly by throwing in a coincidental encounter with an exposition coot (Eli Wallach) an old man sitting in his shack waiting to spill the beans to whomever wanders by. Also you cant have it both ways with sinister international decade-spanning conspiracies. Either nefarious agencies can see 30 years into the future and secretly yank every string from DC to Downing Street or theyre too incompetent to pull off the simple assassination of an unarmed hack on a lonely country road. Not both. A better idea would have been to show super-spies unable to complete a connect-the-dots puzzle. But then the film would have been a documentary. kyle.Smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Olympics oust Idol in TV ratings war Read Next Olympics oust Idol in TV ratings war Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46694 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 22725 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 16495 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"The Ghost Writer movie review Polanskis latest thriller touches on familiar themes |       NJ.com comments The Ghost Writer movie review Polanskis latest thriller touches on familiar themes Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 19 2010 at 503 AM View/Post Comments Ewan McGregor is a journalist assigned to rewrite the memoirs of a former British prime minister in Roman Polanskis latest ""The Ghost Writer.""Ewan McGregor plays a writer who tackles and difficult -- and possibly deadly -- assignment. ""The Ghost Writer"" is a deviously intriguing thriller about a British politician his brittle brilliant wife and a strictly-for-hire memoirist who finds out more about his subject than hed bargained for. It is also a film by Roman Polanski.The Ghost Writer (PG-13) Summit (126 min.)Directed by Roman Polanski. With Ewan McGregor Pierce Brosnan Olivia Williams. Now playing in New York. Stephen Whittys rating Three and a half stars Ratings note The film contains sexual situations brief nudity strong language and brief violence.That second sentence is unfortunately why many people wont be reading this one; theyve already muttered ""pervert"" and turned the page reiterating their determination to never give the jailed director one more dime. And I understand that. Yet its not a stance that I as a film critic can really adhere to. Nor as a film fan would I really want to. Cinema is full of great artists who were also horrendous people. As long as they could keep their horrendous ideas off screen the art remained great. Polanskis ""The Ghost Writer"" is not an apologia for what he did (although a very close look shows a few interesting themes). Its a brilliantly made paranoid leftish political thriller. And its also the first great film of the year. The story revolves around a hungry hack played by Ewan McGregor given an impossible assignment. Theyre the lengthy memoirs of a recent very slick prime minister (played with a wolfish grin by Pierce Brosnan) theyre due in a month and theyre a mess. Also the last ghost writer died under mysterious circumstances. ""The Ghost Writer"" is going to be called Hitchcockian by viewers who focus on the tricky plot and the lush score by Alexandre Desplat. But it isnt really. In fact the adjective it really deserves is one we havent heard in a while Polanski-esque. Right from his first films in Poland Polanskis best movies were marked by a wry absurdism convinced of nothing but looming unavoidable disaster. And the bitterest gag was that the heroes -- sometimes played by Polanski himself -- were never in on the joke. And so in ""The Ghost Writer"" McGregor arrives at some fabulous borrowed mansion to try to get a peek behind Brosnans carefully constructed facade. But what McGregor thinks he sees isnt real. And what he doesnt see could be fatal. McGregor is fine as the writer although frankly he projects a bit too much handsome confidence. Then again part of the hacks problem is that he thinks he knows exactly whats going on -- just as part of the  Brosnan characters power is that he fervently believes his own lies. Wonderful too is Olivia Williams as Brosnans long- (but not silently) suffering wife. Unrecognizable from her mousy teacher in ""An Education"" shes a sexy cipher who makes every scene a veritable acrostic of hidden agendas and secret disappointments. The couple is not -- oh no certainly not -- to be confused with Tony and Cherie Blair. Nor should ""The Ghost Writer"" be confused with the unrelated Philip Roth novel -- or perhaps with previous Polanski masterpieces like ""Repulsion"" or ""The Pianist."" Its a slick conspiracy thriller and part of the reason it stands out is that -- judging by recent films like ""State of Play"" or ""Edge of Darkness"" -- Hollywood no longer knows how to make them. (Interestingly like those films ""The Ghost Writer"" is also based on a previous English work in this case a novel by Robert Harris.) Polanski knows how the genre works though. He knows its not the raving lunatics who frighten but the only slightly ""off"" normal people -- a gardener a cook a chauffeur. He realizes its not what you see thats horrifying but what you dont. (The films last moments -- its best -- center on something that happens off-screen.) Darkly dramatic ""The Ghost Writer"" is Roman Polanskis most accessible film since ""Chinatown."" And when you really look at its themes -- public faces private lies media frenzies and celebrity self-pity -- it may be even more relevant than its audiences and its director realize. Unfortunately because its a ""Roman Polanski film"" those audiences may not see it. And ironically because hes Roman Polanski the director may never really see why.

Movie Information The Ghost WriterRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Roman PolanskiActors Pierce Brosnan Ewan McGregor Kim Cattrall and Olivia WilliamsRun time 132 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (language brief nudity-sexuality some violence and a drug reference)Synopsis Ewan McGregor gets caught up in controversy and intrigue after agreeing to complete the memoirs of a former British prime minister (Pierce Brosnan).More movies from GuideLive.comBased on a 2007 Robert Harris novel the story follows a writer known only as the Ghost (Ewan McGregor). The Ghost is hired to rewrite the political memoirs of the former British prime minister (a nicely shifty Pierce Brosnan). The previous ghost writer committed suicide - or so it was said - on a Cape Cod ferry boat.A more cautious man might walk away from the scenario which sounds too good to be true a quarter-million dollars for just four weeks of work. But were deep in Polanski territory a world where good people are drawn into nightmarish circumstances and the Ghost quickly hops a plane to Massachusetts where the prime minister is holed up.The Ghost Writer was filmed before the directors most recent spate of legal troubles (though editing was reportedly completed at the Swiss chalet where he is under house arrest). Like many of Polanskis pictures this new effort invites an autographical scrutiny that Polanski may or may not have intended.As the Ghost arrives at the mansion and finds himself locked in a room with the manuscript - which is apparently so explosive that it is kept in a safe - the film turns into a fascinating meditation on the notion of exile.The prime minister it turns out is about to come under investigation for possible war crimes Its alleged that he arranged the kidnapping of four British citizens and then allowed them to be tortured by the CIA. If he returns to England he might be arrested. The Ghost is supposed to be pinning him down for extensive interviews. But he finds his attentions diverted first by the politicians steely wife (Olivia Williams) and then by his discovery of an old photograph of a well-known university professor (Jim Broadbent) who is said to have connections to the CIA.Part of the treat of The Ghost Writer which also features a terrific Kim Cattrall as the prime ministers protective secretary is that its not entirely clear with whom Polanski identifies The paranoid writer-artist who feels the walls are closing in around him; or the smooth politician who fears that he might never be able to return home.Maybe the joke is on the audience and all this pseudo-autobiography is just a means by which Polanski can misdirect us from the real matters at hand. As the clues stack up its clear that a grave international crime has been committed but Polanski and Harris (who co-wrote the screenplay adaptation) always manage to stay one teasing step ahead of the audience.The Ghost Writer doesnt quite have the emotional punch of Polanskis most paranoid classics - perhaps because the character of the Ghost remains vaguely defined. McGregor is solid as a figure whose eyes are steadily opened but the screenplay never allows us to fully understand whats going on inside his head. When he turns into a crusader in the final stretch we dont entirely buy his actions.The movie burns with so much style and sophisticated technique that youll be more than willing to forgive this shortcoming. Photographed by Pawel Edelman (who was nominated for the Oscar for Polanskis Pianist) the first half of the movie is shot in overcast grays and sterile whites. But the proceedings turn literally darker Some of the climactic exchanges are in near blackness a la Gordon Willis famously murky cinematography in The Godfather.After taking a somber turn with The Pianist (2002) its wonderful to see Polanski display some of the brazen merciless wit of his early thrillers. The Ghost Writer ends with one of the most wicked shots in recent memory a brutal final twist that alters our understanding of everything that has happened until then.You may not be able to stomach the directors past misdeeds and his present legal troubles but this movie confirms that Polanski is one of the greatest filmmakers alive. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Ghost Writer   out of four Stars Ewan McGregor Pierce Brosnan Olivia WilliamsDirectorRoman PolanskiDistributor SummitRating PG-13 for language brief nudity/sexuality some violence and a drug referenceRunning time 2 hours 8 minutesOpens in limited release By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Paranoia strikes deep this week. Between Martin Scorseses Shutter Island and The Ghost Writer Roman Polanskis sharp political conspiracy tale it is a notable time for acclaimed directors and stylish thrillers. This is the 76-year-old Polanskis first contemporary thriller in two decades and his first film in four years. Its an intelligent and deftly honed return to the genre blending a contemporary plot and classic structure. This tale of an ordinary guy who gets caught up in sinister events evokes Raymond Chandler stories and vintage Alfred Hitchcock films. Marked by clever twists and turns the story unfolds at just the right pace. The dialogue -- adapted by Polanski and British writer Robert Harris from Harris novel The Ghost-- is incisive and interspersed with wit. TRAILER Preview Ghost Writer The main character is a successful ghostwriter referred to by everyone -- including himself -- as ""the Ghost."" But theres nothing ephemeral about him. Ewan McGregor plays him convincingly with humor and likability. Hired to ghostwrite the memoirs of former British prime minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) the Ghost senses something amiss from the moment he agrees to the lucrative gig. He has taken over from a writer who has died suddenly of a purported suicide. The Ghosts discomfort is evident as he makes the trip from London to a remote stretch of Marthas Vineyard where Lang is holed up in a bunker-like beachfront home. Lang becomes embroiled in a scandal accused of illegally seizing suspected terrorists in Pakistan and turning them over to the CIA for waterboarding torture tactics. Meanwhile the Ghost finds the memoir manuscript penned by his predecessor to be astonishingly bland boilerplate. But then the Ghost stumbles on photos and documents that lead him to investigate Langs political origins as well as the mystery surrounding the former writers death. Things get even more complicated as the prime ministers wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) cozies up to the Ghost. Brosnan does a fine job as the charismatic boyish-looking Lang whose character bears a thinly veiled resemblance to former British prime minister Tony Blair. Williams is superb as Ruth Lang whose steely smarts and outspokenness also evoke comparisons with Cherie Blair. These associations are given extra heft by Harris real-life associations with the Blairs during his tenure as a political journalist. The prime minister his ghostwriter the CIA and a multinational corporation called Hatherton (could any name sound closer to Halliburton?) all figure prominently into this tale of power and political intrigue. The films only weak link is a somewhat forced scenario connecting the dots in which individual words from the memoir are pieced together in a revealing code. Still the final payoff is worth it. The Ghost Writer is a spellbinding story. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

"Review Roman Polanskis The Ghost Writer - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Alfred HitchcockMOVIE REVIEW Review Roman Polanskis The Ghost WriterFebruary 19 2010|By KENNETH TURAN | Film Critic Pierce Brosnan and Ewan McGregor face-off in Roman Polanskis latest... (Guy Farrandis / Summit Entertainment )Roman Polanskis been in the news a lot lately but not for the best of reasons. Between his September arrest in Switzerland and the media rehashing of the case that made him flee the U.S. in the first place its been possible to forget that his powerful gifts as a filmmaker were what made him famous in the first place. With the deliciously unsettling ""The Ghost Writer"" however a dark pearl of a movie whose great flair and precision make it Polanskis best work in quite a while the 76-year-old director forcefully reminds us what all the fuss was about. Made by a filmmaker suddenly returned to the height of his powers ""The Ghost Writer"" is a thriller wrapped around a roman A  clef about contemporary politics wrapped around Polanskis perennial blanket cynicism about the helplessness of individuals against the entrenched strength of the powerful. His effortless blending of personal preoccupations with audience preferences recalls as so much of this film does the classic work of Alfred Hitchcock. Its not only that Alexandre Desplats driving score reminds us from its opening moments of the dynamic compositions of Hitchcock composer of choice Bernard Herrmann its that ""The Ghost Writer"" is the kind of impeccable adult entertainment able to alternate edge-of-your-seat episodes with bleakly comic moments that Hitchcock used to specialize in and that Polanski himself realized so successfully in ""Chinatown"" and ""Rosemarys Baby."" Like that last film ""The Ghost Writer"" is based on a successful novel this time written by Robert Harris who collaborated with Polanski on the screenplay and retained the books focus on a former British prime minister and intentional dead ringer for Tony Blair named Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) and the ghost writer (Ewan McGregor) hired to pump up his memoirs. Both actors do excellent work as do costars Kim Cattrall and Olivia Williams but what is especially noteworthy is the care taken by Polanski and casting director Fiona Weir with every single performer who appears on screen from a knockout cameo by 94-year-old Eli Wallach to featured players like Tom Wilkinson Timothy Hutton David Rintoul and James Belushi to an irresistible moment by Polanskis daughter Morgane as a hotel receptionist trapped in period costume. These people not only act beautifully they all work in concert with the director toward creating the across-the-board mood of nagging unease of nefarious doings just outside our line of sight that has always been one of Polanskis strengths. Starting with the opening shot of a somehow unnerving ferry docking at an unnamed American island (its supposed to be Marthas Vineyard though exteriors were shot on the German island of Sylt) everything in this film feels suspect even nominally blameless items like a cars talkative satellite navigation device and a pair of silent Asian housekeepers named Dep and Duc. Before we meet Dep and Duc or their employer the former prime minister were taken into the world of the never-named ghost writer who is up for the job because the body of the previous writer a close associate of the P.M. named Mike McAra has washed up on shore after apparently falling off that ferry. The new ghost admits to knowing nothing about politics (his last book was a magician memoir titled ""I Came I Sawed I Conquered"") but hes hired by a team that includes Belushis bullet-headed publisher and Huttons wily attorney because he promises to emphasize the human side of the man. Adam Lang proves to be something of an airhead someone who prefers exercise to all else but the two women in his life are anything but dull. Langs wife Ruth (""An Educations"" excellent Olivia Williams) would be acerbic and protective under the best of circumstances but she is feeling especially edgy because she suspects her husbands having an affair with his svelte blond personal assistant Amelia (a tart Kim Cattrall). No sooner does the ghost arrive at Langs American island retreat than a bombshell drops The former P.M. is accused of ordering the kidnapping of suspected terrorists and handing them over to the CIA for torture a charge that if true would make him liable to prosecution for war crimes by the International Criminal Court in Geneva. ""What"" the ghost screams over the phone to his agent ""have you gotten me into?"" McGregor a busy actor who doesnt always pick his projects carefully is excellent as the Ghost With No Name. Its a tricky role demanding he hold our interest as a decent and capable everyman while allowing for him to be gullible enough to get caught up in the powerful undertow of forces beyond his control. More than that the film elegantly hints but never pushes that there just might be some kind of extrasensory connection between this ghost and the one who came before. Speaking of connections it is especially heartening to see a letter-perfect Wallach bring the same kind of brio to a small part as an island resident he brought to ""Mystic River"" back in 2003. That film was the start of a directing renaissance for Clint Eastwood and with any kind of luck this film just might signal a new beginning for Polanski as well. kenneth.turan latimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCritics pick The Ghost WriterMarch 11 2010Kenneth Turan The Ghost WriterFebruary 25 2010Ghost Writers real-life parallels haunt the movie and...February 14 2010Polanski film gets distributor in U.S.December 12 2009Polanski gives no hint of returning to U.S.May 1 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTAlfred HitchcockEntertainmentRoman PolanskiEwan McgregorCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-ghostwriter19-2010feb19,0,5640884.story",200,theghostwriter24,theghostwriter,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet It is both easy and impossible to separate Roman Polanski the person from Roman Polanski the filmmaker when considering his briskly entertaining new thriller The Ghost Writer and thats entirely to the films benefit. Its easy because Polanski remains a consummate craftsman just as capable of making swift witty precisely stylized diversions now as when he made Knife In The Water nearly 50 years ago. And yet theres no mistaking the oppressive sense of isolation and exile that hangs over the proceedings and how it relates to a man who has known public disgrace and life on the run. The Ghost Writer may not go down as one of Polanskis masterpieces but if it does end up being his swan song its the ideal denouement to a life and career of unsettling resonance. Based on Robert Harris novel The Ghost the film opens with cars pulling off an island ferry onto the mainland; every car that is but one. The driver washes ashore a couple of days later presumed dead from an accident or a suicide but of course theres more to the story. As it turns out the deceased is a close confidant to a disgraced former British prime minister (Pierce Brosnan) and hed been on the island to help put the finishing touches on Brosnans highly anticipated memoir. Brosnans publisher eager to get the book out fast hires Ewan McGregor who normally specializes in quick-and-dirty celebrity autobios to punch up the tome and turn it around in a month. When McGregor arrives he finds the book a terrible bore but he runs into much bigger problems once he learns of the deeper darker intrigue surrounding Brosnan and his inner circle. The connections to Tony Blair and his insidious dealings with America and the CIA in the lead-up to the Iraq War are unmistakable and damning; if Polanski set out to catch the conscience of the king hes made the perfect play to do it. And in the role of the suffering wife Olivia Williams creates a wonderfully modern femme fatale a quietly powerful woman whose shame has curdled into duplicity. With much of the action confined to the dark spaces of Brosnans island compound The Ghost Writer has the suffocating scale of a chamber piece one Polanski could pull off in his sleep. Yet in its entertaining mix of the topical and the personal the film is a vital record of the times both for its maker and the world from his window.

What the world knows about the 76-year-old filmmaker -- that hes currently under house arrest in Switzerland still embroiled in his ugly 1977 U.S. case involving sex with a then-13-year-old girl -- hovers like a phantom over every frame of this satisfying melancholy political suspense story. The disturbing information cant be ignored. But neither ought it distract viewers from a well-made sleekly retaliatory pleasurably paranoid tale in praise of enterprising (and also brave) investigative journalists and in condemnation of political skulduggery in general and right-wing Anglo-American collusion in particular. British best-selling author Robert Harris wrote the novel; Harris and Polanski penned the adapted screenplay with a feel for a contemporary movie audience sick to death of headlines about U.S. involvement in covert torture operations. The ""ghost"" of the title -- whos never actually given a name -- is a reputable author (thoughtfully played by Ewan McGregor) hired to write the memoirs of controversial former British prime minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan cast to a T). Feel free to read allusions to Tony Blair in Langs situation since as a journalist Harris was once close to the ex-PM. Certainly Olivia Williams (An Education) as Langs powerful wife has more than a touch of Cherie Blairs forthrightness in her. McGregor actually plays a replacement ghost since a previously hired scribe has died found drowned in a suspicious accident in the waters between Langs secluded beach home on Marthas Vineyard and the Massachusetts mainland as the story opens. Polanski and Harris do a jolly good job of letting the circles of untrustworthy characters (including Kim Cattrall blouse tucked in as Langs protective assistant and Tom ? Wilkinson as a secretive Harvard prof) ripple outward like rings from a stone thrown into water. Indeed water figures everywhere -- its forever raining and the Ghost rides a bike through sad puddles. Meanwhile at the shoreline a severely modern concrete bunker of a beach house filmed on German location tries to distract us from the evident fact that were really not on Marthas Vineyard. After all the director a wanted man in the U.S. cant set foot there.

"Ghost Writer The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ghost-writer-the ) Ghost Writer The (France/Germany/United Kingdom 2010) February 16 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Ghost Writer is a reminder that regardless of his real-life problems Roman Polanski can still craft compelling thrillers. This isnt Chinatown but it doesnt need to be. Based on the novel The Ghost by Robert Harris its a fictional tale unambiguously designed to validate various conspiracy theories that have been in existence since the war in Iraq began. The film is effectively paced and does not suffer from the awkward compression problems that sometimes accompany the stripping down of complex novels into two hour motion pictures. There are times when the movie relies upon hard-to-swallow coincidences to propel the narrative forward (the oh-so-convenient appearance of Eli Wallach being one example) but on the whole The Ghost Writer holds together. This is especially remarkable when one considers that a significant portion of the post-production was done by Polanski while under arrest. The film opens with an unoccupied car left abandoned on a ferry while a body washes up on a nearby beach near the Massachusetts retreat of ex-British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). It turns out that the dead man was the ghost writer of Langs autobiography and a replacement has to be found quickly in order to ensure the publication date doesnt slip. The job goes to the movies unnamed protagonist (Ewan McGregor) who finds himself thrust into the midst of a maelstrom of personal and political crises. Lang is about to be charged by the World Court for crimes against humanity his former close political ally Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh) has turned against him and his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) has lost patience over his brazen affair with his assistant Amelia (Kim Cattrall). As the Ghost Writer begins to dig he uncovers information that puts his life in danger. Lang represents a Prime Minister in the Tony Blair mold and the story postulates how Blair might have come to support George W. Bushs war in Iraq. Theres a Haliburton-inspired company and various unsavory characters skulking in the background. The Ghost Writer neither claims to be representing the truth nor to be based on actual events but its obvious where its roots are buried. Nonetheless some of the best thrillers have developed from fictionalized accounts of historical events. Polanski also pokes fun at his own situation. After Lang has been accused of crimes against humanity he realizes he must remain in the United States since its one of the few countries that does not recognize the jurisdiction of the court. As long as hes in America he can be a free man; if he returns to the U.K. he will be arrested upon arrival. The irony of incorporating this story element must have been too delicious for Polanksi to bypass. (Whether its in good taste is another matter altogether.) The action/thriller aspects are handled expertly. The chase sequences are involving. Theres never a sense that the protagonist is invulnerable - hes far from a superhero. The film keeps us guessing for a while and even once we think we have figured out whats going on the possibility exists that were misreading something. There are two twists in the final act that although not changing the essential backbone of the story divorce The Ghost Writer from some of the most common conventions of this sort of thriller. Ewan McGregor plays (or underplays) the sort of low-key role he has become comfortable with in his post-Star Wars career - a slightly wimpy guy who gets sucked into something because hes in the wrong place at the wrong time. (Often after thinking its the right place and the right time.) Pierce Brosnan has the requisite good looks and charm to allow us to believe he was once a Prime Minister; I didnt think of 007 once during the course of the movie which shows that Brosnan has moved on in ways his predecessors were unable to do. (Connery despite shedding the role in the early 70s found that it dogged him to the day of his retirement.) Olivia Williams is a little scary as the cold calculating silent power behind her husband. Only Kim Cattrall strikes a wrong note. The superficiality of her performance is out-of-step with the importance of the role. A lot of familiar faces show up in small roles Jim Belushi Timothy Hutton Eli Wallach and - most memorably - Tom Wilkinson. A word must be said about the look of the film. Most of it transpires in New England and unless Polanski found a way to sneak into the United States without anyone knowing he found a note-perfect stand-in. Maybe denizens of the real Cape Cod will recognize the differences but I was fooled. The same holds true with scenes set in London - another location where if I am not mistaken Polanski needed to avoid (at least at the time). Whatever chicanery he employed to clone Massachusetts and London it was expertly done. As with most political thrillers The Ghost Writer emphasizes plot development and atmosphere over action. Its an ""adult"" thriller as opposed to one designed for viewers suffering from ADD. The running time which clocks in at a shade over two hours seems a little on the long side. Overall however its a successful endeavor from a filmmaker whose future behind-the-camera enterprises are in doubt.

Then again when your life is like a mash-up of the History Channels entire catalog of shock programming autobiography will probably influence your fictions and Polanski seems inspired as he maintains implausible momentum with a cloudy premise. Ewan McGregor diffidently plays the so-called ghost to exiled politician Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) living in cushioned seclusion off the gray New England coast. The writer is hacking through the bombast left by his (dead) predecessor when Langs past war-on-terrorism overstepping raises Blair-style static. Saved by often delightfully bitchy British dialogue the movie sees McGregors (arbitrarily written) semi-naif stumbling onto conspiracies and dueling with Langs wife and mistress (Olivia Williams and Kim Cattrall both sharp). What actually happens is less important than the barest glimmers of that old Polanski magic ambient paranoia (aided by the Cul-de-Sac-y lands-end setting) and uneven power struggles (one involving a very crafty Tom Wilkinson as an old Lang associate). The wrap-up is one strange ah-fuggit mess on top of Google-powered plot moves but Polanskis work therapy could have been a lot worse.

"The Ghost Writer | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review The Ghost Writer Derek Elley 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr February 12 2010 | 1230PM PT Roman Polanskis all-too-faithful adaptation of a bestseller is low on sustained tension. The best thing that can be said about Roman Polanskis pic version of Robert Harris bestseller ""The Ghost"" is that auds wont need to read the original novel. With a few exceptions and necessary tightening its pretty much all up on the screen -- page by page of plot line by line of dialogue -- in one of the most literal adaptations (by the British journo-turned-novelist himself) since the Harry Potter series. Low on sustained tension and with a weak central perf by Ewan McGregor in the titular role ""The Ghost Writer"" looks set for moderate biz at best in Europe with much briefer haunting of North American salles. Pics literalism is also its biggest handicap. Eight years since his last major success ""The Pianist"" the 76-old-helmer brings not a jot of his own directorial personality or quirks to a political pulp thriller whose weaknesses (let alone lack of any real action or thrills) are laid bare when brought to the screen is such a workmanlike anonymous way. With Polanski himself unable to travel Stateside or to Blighty the largely New England-set story was entirely shot in Germany -- and sometimes looks like it. Despite the abundance of art direction and props to convince viewers that the locations are in wintry Marthas Vineyard and not Sylt northern Germany interiors -- especially of the central house -- look unmistakably modern-Teuton in their clean lines and small details. Some second-unit work was done in the U.K. and France and post-production finished while the helmer was under house arrest in Gstaad Switzerland -- probably the first such instance of remote direction since imprisoned Turkish director Yilmaz Guney in the 70s. Sans any front-end titles story gets right down to business as the body of Michael McAra washes up on the shores of Marthas Vineyard. McAra had just finished ghost-writing the memoirs of former Brit prime minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) to whom he was an old friend-cum-political advisor and the publishers whove ponied up 10 million for the tome urgently need another ghost to jazz up the tedious manuscript. Repped by his young American agent Rick (Jon Bernthal) a successful British ghost writer (McGregor) -- unnamed both here and in the novel -- is interviewed by U.S. publishing exec John Maddox (James Belushi in a ripe but brief cameo) and Langs Washington attorney Sidney Kroll (Timothy Hutton). The Brit is hired on the spot for a months work for 250k and flown to a luxurious private house in Marthas Vineyard where Lang is based during a U.S. lecture tour. But the ghost is already suspicious of what hes getting into after being mugged in a London street immediately after the meeting. At the New England coastal retreat McAras manuscript and Lang himself are guarded around the clock in a security operation run by Langs (very) personal assistant blonde iceberg Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall with an almost flawless cut-glass Brit accent). Mooning around with her claws mostly sheathed is Langs wife Ruth (Olivia Williams). Harris novel made headlines at the time for its barely disguised similarities between Lang and former Brit p.m. Tony Blair as well as between Ruth and Cherie Blair. But Brosnan is much more movie-star Brosnan than a Blair stand-in (was Michael Sheen unavailable?) though Williams in the pics best performance adopts subtle hints of Cherie in her wardrobe and tart manner. As the ghost starts interviewing Lang for color and juicy tidbits the heat is turned up when Langs onetime foreign minister Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh) demands Lang be brought to trial for war crimes. Rycart claims Lang colluded in the kidnapping of four alleged Pakistani terrorists and their handover to the CIA for torture during which one died. When the ghost learns that McAra had also uncovered a deeply buried truth about Langs political past he begins to fear for his own life as well. All the ingredients are here for a rip-roaring political thriller with corruption in the highest places and a cast of sexy and/or suspicious characters but for the first hour theres little accumulated atmosphere or any sense of a bigger story hiding in the wings. Polanski simply transfers Harris undistinguished prose direct to the screen and though the pace picks up marginally in the second half theres little wow factor in the revelations as they appear. With McGregor a sappy lead and Brosnan hardly believable as a British ex-politician its Williams who provides the most pleasure in a gradually evolving role that at one point takes on a calculated sexiness. Tom Wilkinson hints at what the movie could have been in a beautifully played scene with McGregor thats packed with polite menace and 94-year-old vet Eli Wallach pops up in a strongly delivered cameo. More music by Alexandre Desplat whose score is notably absent during the initial first hour could have helped a little. Widescreen lensing by Polish d.p. Pawel Edelman (""Oliver Twist"" ""The Pianist"") is fine at capturing the bleak wintry exteriors and cool geometrical interiors. But what the picture most needed was a complete cinematic rethink and yes even some action to move it along.
