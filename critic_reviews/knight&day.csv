Yes the script could have done with more work but was it worth the one star trashing and the complete denial of seeing a plot? No. Yes there is a plot and yes it is half decent.The acting is good the direction is good in fact everythings good except the scripts cheese ball ending.... although this was supposed to be cheesey so maybe I should forgive it that. Its a fun film for a rainy day doesnt require any deep level thinking and its a hell of a lot better than eclipse killers shrek all of which got 2 or 3 star reviews.

By David Denby Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise in James Mangolds new movie.   Credit Illustration by Robert Risko Tom Cruise was very funny in the 1999 movie ""Magnolia."" Playing a satanic sex guru dressed in black he effectively spoofed the over-galvanized acting style of his youth. But in ""Knight and Day"" he has reverted to his old whirling-arms flashing-choppers mode of performance. Hes Roy Miller a C.I.A. agent who pulls an innocent woman June Havens (Cameron Diaz) into a scheme to protect a Gyro Gearloose-type boy scientist (Paul Dano). The young whiz has created the Zephyr a battery that though thumb-size can power a small city. Crooked elements in the C.I.A. are battling an arms dealer for control of the Zephyr and Roy needing to escape people who will kill him in order to get it uses June as a mule and then presumably just because he likes having her around drugs her again and again carrying her off first to an island in the middle of nowhere and then to Salzburg and Seville. Roy is supposed to be a reckless and debonair fellow and he says such things to June as ""Im just going to shoot them. Ill be right back."" When Cruise was young he played hustlers with terrific drive but cool is out of his range--hes too jacked up for it. In this picture as he tries to be dominating and suave like Cary Grant in ""Charade"" or Sean Connery as Bond he talks a mile a minute whips his shirt off and comes across as a shiny overwrought star deluded about his own charm. Cameron Diaz has her good-girl warmth and her happy giggle; shes likable and game and you feel for her because she looks off balance unable to find a comfortable rhythm with her megalomaniacal partner. Her only funny bit takes place when Cruise is not around a villainous Spaniard gives June a truth drug and Diaz laughs at the naughty cracks that come pouring out of her. But a lot of the time she has to play dumb. When she grabs a machine gun she holds the trigger down and cant stop spraying bullets all over the place. How hard is it really to take your finger off the trigger? Right about now audiences could use an international comedy-thriller with fancy travel fine hotels and dazzling oil-free beaches. ""Knight and Day"" has all the elements of enjoyable nonsense-adventure--its highly vehicular with a passenger jet that crashes in a corn field a train speeding through the Alps and cars smashing into one another--but the movie which is directed by James Mangold from a script by Patrick ONeill is jumpy unmotivated and senseless. Mangold did impressive work in ""310 to Yuma"" with such volatile actors as Russell Crowe and Christian Bale but Cruises nervous energy seems to have thrown him off. ""Knight and Day"" moves so abruptly from place to place that we dont even get a chance to ogle the scenery and the stately old-Europe buildings. Were not meant to take the plot seriously and we dont but a ridiculous plot needs some style to push it into enjoyable fantasy and even the most careless of the Bond pictures had more panache than ""Knight and Day."" Given the kind of travelogue romance that it is the film has to work for adults but its written directed and edited as if it were aimed at teens. Like ninja assassins in a schlock action movie C.I.A. dummies show up by the handful and Roy blows them all away. He gets plugged and falls into a river and reappears later without explanation. We dont ask for much from this kind of movie but ""Knight and Day"" tramples on our desire for just enough plausibility to release the fun. It makes us feel like fools for wanting to be entertained by froth. In the extraordinary independent film ""Winters Bone"" the large Dolly clan lives off the grid. The movie is set in the Missouri Ozarks in backcountry--way back where the front yards are filled with dead cars and cracked toilets and the children ride wooden horses and hunt squirrels. There are no telephones much less cell phones or computers and not a TV in sight. Poverty is not necessarily the issue the Dollys we can see dont particularly want to join the consumer society; they live among cast-off things because theyre used to them. Their indifference to the outside world turns hostile when theyre visited by ""the law."" Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) the brilliant determined seventeen-year-old who is the heroine of the movie is a law unto herself. She takes care of her withdrawn mother and her kid brother and sister and she treks across a colorless winter landscape visiting relatives as she looks for her father Jessup who cooks methamphetamine for a living. Jessup was arrested and then released when he put up his house and land as bond. If he doesnt appear in court Ree and the rest of her immediate family will lose everything. The script--which the director Debra Granik and her collaborator Anne Rosellini adapted from the 2006 novel by Daniel Woodrell--doesnt spell things out but as Ree travels around we slowly get the point all the Dollys in one way or another are involved in the meth trade. They guard secrets that they dont wish Ree to know about or even ask about. Without making an actual appearance meth is a character in the film creating paranoia and corruption everywhere. ""Winters Bone"" is something new in movies a ""country-noir"" thriller. Daniel Woodrell writes with insistent rhythm and an evocative and poetic regional flavor. Its a good style but a literary one and the filmmakers while drawing heavily on Woodrells plot and dialogue dont try to imitate it. The movie which was plainly and beautifully shot by Michael McDonough is matter of fact with a strong feeling for the dailiness of life. Yet the Ozarks are a world so little known to most of us that the physical details seem a revelation a fulfillment of realisms promise to show us what we have never seen or noticed before. And the plainness never goes slack so the thick physical texture is entirely dramatic. Debra Granik who earlier made ""Down to the Bone"" with Vera Farmiga creates an aura of violence through suggestion half-finished sentences or a threatening or sorrowful look; she envelops us in mysteries that can never quite be solved because the Dollys dont want them solved. Truculent and reserved eloquent only in brief outbursts garnished with a twist of perverse wit the Dollys operate with a double-edged sense of kinship--they will protect you up to a point but at the same time your life belongs to them. Ree never knows what shes going to face a relative will be helpful one moment and intimidating the next. There have been a lot of earnest methodical movies coming out of the Sundance Film Festival lately but ""Winters Bone"" which premiered there and took the best-picture prize is what weve been waiting for a work of art that grabs hold and wont let go. It was shot with digital equipment for a mere two million dollars buoyed by tax incentives from the state of Missouri. The cast members seem rooted marked by tough times and utterly authentic. Some of them are local people but the main roles are taken by professional actors including Jennifer Lawrence who has flowing blond hair lidless blue eyes and a full mouth. Her Ree is the head of a household a womanly girl with no time for her own pleasure and Lawrence establishes the characters authority right away with a level stare and an unhurried voice that suggest heavy lifting from an early age. The movie would be unimaginable with anyone less charismatic playing Ree. In a series of soul-shaking confrontations Lawrence is matched by the veteran character actress Dale Dickey who plays the wife of the clans crime boss with an uncanny bitter intensity and by John Hawkes as Rees uncle who at first seems antagonistic and wasted--no one has ever dragged on a cigarette with greater need--but becomes something else Rees protector and a moral man unafraid of death. In all the acting and the milieu are so closely joined that when the final shot goes to black and the spell is broken the audience gasps. An album of snapshots from an earlier time suggests that the Dollys have fallen from a stable prosperous middle-class life. We dont know why theyve fallen though the drug trade and the military seem to be the only career paths that they consider following. ""Winters Bone"" isnt a liberal sociological study of poverty; nor does it rely on genre conventions. We feel so apprehensive for Ree because we have no idea which way the story will go Mafia behavior is predictable; the Dollys are unfathomable. We look to the older Dolly women for clues. They work at protecting their mangy surly men but they know how to get around them too and when they have to they do the dirty business of cleaning up crimes. Ree is the only hope amid this sordid life. Shes not just the most interesting teen-ager around shes more believable as a heroic character than any of the men weve seen peacocking through movies recently. In its lived-in completely non-ideological way ""Winters Bone"" is one of the great feminist works in film.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Knight and Day amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Toy Story 3 The Twilight Saga Eclipse >> Knight and Day In a crowded airport Tom Cruise stalks Cameron Diaz as she wrestles with her carry-on luggage. Like most rom com femmes shes a harried never-married blonde but because shes Cameron Diaz her smile doesnt sag with self-pity or wary walled-off over-confidence. In fact she claims to be a restorer of vintage cars a hobby thats implausible but not wildly implausible -- few other tomboy beauties could say the same. Long of leg yellow of hair big of eye Diaz is the right heroine for a flick thats as exaggerated as she is. And Cruise is a risky gamble who pays big dividends. As a secret agent on the lam hes everything the Cruise brand used to mean. His Teflon cool and calculating charm are amped up for comic effect. Clinging to a speeding car or sweet-talking Diazs ex-boyfriend (Marc Blucas) after he shoots him in the leg hes Cruise cranked up to 13 -- a whole lotta smooth and a jolt of crazy. When he collides (literally) with Diaz in the security line he swoops her into his orbit like an electron. The bad guys who sure seem like the sane guys have unlimited power to chase him down and reclaim an uber battery designed by autistic genius Paul Dano. In the films nifty opening brawl were wondering which passenger on their nearly flight is the mole. Turns out its all of them -- even the stewardess -- a fitting choice for a film with a hunger for more more more. Director James Mangold piles it on an 80s flick body count a bull stampede and enough crushed cars to feed Truckasaurus. And Cruise backlit by explosions is the constant in the madness. Hes sunny as an egg an action star who doesnt glower -- what a relief A running gag in Patrick ONeills screenplay has Cruise regularly roofie Diaz when things get hairy. Through her eyes we fade in and out as we catch glimpses of their comic book escapes. One moment he boasts ""I got this"" while chained up by his feet. Cut to Cruise and a still-unconscious Diaz parachuting from a crashing helicopter. Its a cartoon convenience a low-budget film should steal to skimp on special effects. But as this blockbuster flaunts its cash like a sheik Mangold is just advertising that he can give us more movie than we can handle. The romance between Cruise and Diaz doesnt soar but its sensical. Along with it comes the theme of identity -- if Cruises agent has sacrificed his life to the governments cause there truly is no him. Can a cipher be loved? Its the question of Cruises career. Since 19 hes lived his life in front of cameras. He gives every role his all but selects roles that let him hold himself at a distance. His persona merged with his person. And the two are inextricable. Cruise has been calculating his comeback and hes chosen wisely. This popcorn pleasure reminds us that after years of gloom and doom and daddy issues we need a leading man with conceit and charm someone who can throw a serious punch without taking himself too seriously. Cruise has returned and Im rolling out the welcome mat. Click here for Knight and Day in the IE Weekly This entry was posted on Friday June 25th 2010 at 213 pm      and is filed under Film IE Weekly.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Jun 24 2010 Culture gt;Twentieth Century FoxFirst a clarification regarding the title of the newly released action-comedy Knight and Day ""Knight"" refers either to a) the long-abandoned family name of one of the two principal characters a glamorous superspy played by Tom Cruise who for all narrative and promotional purposes now goes by the name ""Roy Miller""; or b) a small toy paladin in which a Secret Device that Could Change the World is briefly hidden. And ""Day""? One might imagine that it refers to the spunky everygal played by costar Cameron Diaz. One would be wrong. (Her characters name is ""June Havens."") In fact it doesnt refer to anything at all; the words sole purpose is to balance the already-a-stretch ""Knight."" I mean honestly. If we had to go down this path at all why not A Knight to Remember or Knight Moves? The titillating PG-13 innuendo of A Knight in June? Or with appropriate legal representation on call Darkest Knight? But no for no discernable reason outside the preferences of some anonymous focus group were given Knight and Day Cole Porter be damned. A film that treats its own title so ahem cavalierly can hardly be expected to be diligent when it comes to such niceties as plot character and pacing--but Knight and Day exceeds even such anti-expectations. It is woefully scattered alternatingly slack and frenetic and transcendently preposterous. Remarkably it is also for a time reasonably diverting for anyone willing to jettison everything they know about love espionage and narrative cohesion.The tale begins at the Wichita airport where we meet June and learn exactly two things about her first that she restores vintage muscle cars (so males in the audience will find her irresistible); and second that she has a bad case of little-sister-getting-married-before-her (so females in the audience will find her sympathetic). On her way through security June repeatedly runs into Roy himself a fetching grin sandwiched between windbreaker and sunglasses. June is bumped from her flight but is subsequently put back on it only to discover there are just a handful of passengers on the plane Roy included. (The reasons for Junes bumping and de-bumping are obscure an early sign that the screenplay--credited to newcomer Patrick ONeill but subsequently rewritten by half a dozen others--will not infrequently be divided against itself.) June and Roy flirt lightly until she visits the lavatory at which point the other passengers along with both pilots and the navigator all try to assassinate Roy. Happily he is much better at this kind of thing than they are so he kills them instead crash lands the jet himself warns June about the nameless baddies who will soon come looking and gently drugs her. She wakes the next morning in her own bed with friendly Roy-notes offering life-saving advice scattered around her apartment.To describe such plotting as ridiculous might sprain the term itself. Yet for those of generous spirit and easily suspended disbelief (you may wish to re-read the previous paragraph before deciding whether you qualify) the first few reels of Knight and Day offer a kind of giddy kinetic nonsense. Cruise still eager to erase his image as self-serious Scientologist and overplayed inamorata punctures his longstanding action persona with sly wit and self-effacing charm. (Where has this fellow been since Risky Business?) And Diaz gets more mileage than one would imagine from her otherwise exhausted role as the bubbly-but-tough innocent bystander/eventual love interest. The two are even supplied with a handful of moderately inspired gags the best of which doubles as an ingenious way to cut down on the studio costs of a big aerial escape scene. As backup Peter Sarsgaard Viola Davis and Paul Dano offer above-average spins on the Scheming Turncoat the Hardnosed Spymaster and the Good-Natured Geek respectively.But in the end--or rather by the midpoint--its not enough. Over time the scripts internal confusions become too vivid to ignore. (In particular a subplot in which Roy ostensibly for Junes safety contrives to have her captured by the very people he has claimed want her dead achieves a level of logic-melting idiocy.) Worse nearly every half-memorable joke in the film is told a second time and in some cases a third--a textbook demonstration that recycling is not always a virtue. By the finale its hard to shake the sense that the movie has already expired and everyone involved--Cruise Diaz director James Mangold the battalion of screenwriters--are just trying to prop it up Weekend at Bernies-style long enough to heave it over the 100-minute mark. What is perhaps most dispiriting about Knight and Day is what it suggests about Hollywood and the comedy-thriller-romance subgenre a hybrid once responsible for such ineffable delights as Charade and To Catch a Thief. Last years marquee attempt Tony Gilroys Duplicity boasted the requisite intelligence but lacked the enlivening ebullience. Knight and Day by contrast fails more typically. Nimble enough on its feet when cars are crashing and bullets whizzing--Cruise and Diazs best scenes almost all take advantage of the incongruity of conversation at such moments--it has no idea at all what a man and woman might talk about when deprived of such violent backdrops. When the action slows the dialogue which ought to pick up pace stalls as well. (""Fitz set me up.... Thats when I met you"" he tells her; ""Who are you really?"" she asks him.) Like 2005s Mr. and Mrs. Smith another film that began with the promise of romantic chemistry before veering onto the easier (and more lucrative) terrain of body-count Knight and Day is vastly more at ease with the bang-bang than the kiss-kiss let alone any talk-talk. Relatively early in the proceedings June begs of Roy ""Please stop shooting people okay? Just stop shooting people."" Its a plea viewers may share--one that inevitably goes unheeded.

Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.)

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 23 2010 Save for later Saved Knight and Day debuts Wednesday night. Frank Masi/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of While watching the new Tom Cruise-Cameron Diaz spy thriller ""Knight and Day"" I kept flashing back to Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint in Alfred Hitchcocks ""North by Northwest"" and Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Stanley Donens ""Charade"" the best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made.This is not surprising since ""Knight and Day"" directed by James Mangold and written by Patrick ONeill draws heavily on both of them. But ah - what a difference. Those movies had a deftness and wit that propelled the action and enhanced the romance. ""Knight and Day"" as is true of just about every movie these days that has a gun in it is a supersized kid pic. Its easier to sit through than say ""The A-Team"" which was even louder and made even less sense. (In other words it made no sense.) But as Cruise and Diaz kept dodging and trading bullets - and knives and rocket launchers and grenades - I couldnt help wondering With all the money expended on this movie couldnt anybody come up with a few good lines in between all the kabooms? Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Cruise plays Roy Miller a secret agent who has supposedly gone rogue. We are first introduced to him as he flirts with a fellow passenger June Havens (Diaz) on a near-empty jetliner from which he soon methodically wipes out the flight crew. Taking over the controls he crash-lands in a cornfield (pale shades of ""North by Northwest."") Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Roy is an amalgam of Cruises Ethan Hunt from the ""Mission Impossible"" movies with a little Jason Bourne thrown in. In other words hes a pastiche of a pastiche. As always Cruise plays these parts as if even in repose he was doing heavy calisthenics. Hes exhaustingly avid which doesnt help the romance much. Hes more interested in his own energy than his costars.Diaz is stuck playing the lovely-daffy damsel in distress as the action shifts from Boston to the Austrian Alps to Sevilla Spain. She gets in a few good punches of her own as the duo is pursued by the CIA and the FBI and international weapons dealers and for all I know the Keystone Kops. By giving as good as she gets June is not-so-convincingly transformed into a curious combo a feminist snuggle bunny.Maybe the filmmakers were tired of seeing Angelina Jolie mow down the opposition cyborg-style. Diaz turns on the waifish charm despite dialogue that curdles in mid-sentence. I sympathized more with the actresss plight than with Junes.Even a good no-brainer action movie requires brains to make. Its been a long time since a big Hollywood escapade had a satisfying story but ""Knight and Day"" doesnt even try for one. It assumes rightly I fear that attention-deficit stylistics are a perfect fit for attention-deprived audiences. Im tempted to say this represents the triumph of the video-game aesthetic except most video games have better narratives than ""Knight and Day."" The people who made ""Knight and Day"" may think theyre giving audiences what they want but what theyre really saying is This is what audiences deserve. Grade C (Rated PG-13 for sequences of action violence throughout and brief strong language.)

Twentieth Century Fox By Joe Morgenstern Updated June 25 2010 1201 a.m. ET The pretext for all the thunderous comings and goings in ""Knight and Day"" is a small battery hardly larger than a D-cell that the hero must keep out of the hands of various bad guys. It is not we are told ""your average Duracell"" but ""the first perpetual energy source since the sun."" The source of this movies energy is near-perpetual desperation. You can see it in Tom Cruises fixed grin and in the mad proliferation of unspecial effects. You can feel it in the feverish pace and in the stuttering style of an action adventure that wants to be seen as a gleeful send-up of ""Mission Impossible"" yet mires its star in hapless self-parody. Watch a clip from ""Knight and Day"" starring Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise. For years now summer movies have been wearing their audiences down. With the spectacular exception of ""Toy Story 3"" this summers studio releases have been so dispiriting that even critics who know better are blunting their barbs and giving trash a pass as harmless entertainment. Ive done that too on occasion; being a serial spoilsport isnt a lot of fun. Far from wearing me down though ""Knight and Day"" woke me up to just how awful some summer entertainments have become. It isnt that the film is harmful except to moviegoers wallets and movie lovers morale but that it is truly phenomenal for the purity of its incoherence. The starting point of the story is a chance encounter between Mr. Cruises Roy Miller a secret agent on a mission more dangerous than he knows and Cameron Diazs June Havens who restores old cars for a living. The starting point of the writers--there must have been a bunch though Patrick ONeill gets sole writer credit--was Hitchcocks ""North by Northwest"" with the genders reversed June is the innocent originally played by Cary Grant who gets caught up in a succession of incomprehensible events. (Within the limits of the enterprise Ms. Diaz manages to be likable though the movie finally presses her into awfully foolish action-heroine service in the dubious tradition of ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith."") But what was mysterious in the Hitchcock film is gibberish in this one which was directed by James Mangold. At least some of it was directed by Mr. Mangold. Much of it is the consequence of what Ive come to think of as digital delirium a state of being that prompts studios with deep pockets and shallow perspectives to believe that because something can be done digitally it should be done. Almost anything can be done with these new techniques and ""Knight and Day"" is here to prove it--an airliners crash landing which is absolutely devoid of any drama; an airborne motorcycle; a running of Pamplonas bulls; a relentless succession of ritual explosions and a series of chases that fill the sky with a galaxy of spinning cars. These effects are familiar of course but no longer amusingly so as they were in the digital eras early days. Now theyre snorefully boring and cumulatively deadening because they owe no allegiance to the laws of physics let alone to the dictates of effective drama. As big-budget special effects grow ever more ungrounded the movies that rely on them are coming unmoored. Watch the trailer from the documentary ""Restrepo."" Restrepo In one sense ""Restrepo"" is timeless. The subjects of this superb documentary by Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger are the men called doughboys in World War I dogfaces in World War II and grunts in Vietnam--in other words American soldiers who were fighting wars on the ground long before the phrase ""on the ground"" became a media cliche. In another sense the film could not be more timely since the setting is the Korengal Valley of Afghanistan one of that nations most dangerous areas. The action is worlds away from the centers of power where generals and their president are currently struggling to set policy. The men depicted here are members of a platoon on a 15-month deployment that began in May 2007. They live in tents and huddle behind makeshift fortifications--apart from the weaponry and the terrain this could be trench warfare in 1917--when they arent going forth with unfathomable courage to ""extend the security bubble"" in one soldiers words and push out the Taliban insurgency. ENLARGE Spc. Kyle Steiner at Afghanistans Outpost Restrepo in Restrepo. Outpost Films The film takes its title from a remote (even for Afghanistan) 15-man outpost that was named for the platoons medic Juan ""Doc"" Restrepo beloved of his buddies and killed in action. Establishing the outpost was a heroic achievement in its own right for the troops constantly come under enemy fire. And not just an occasional snipers bullet but four or five firefights every day with Taliban fighters who at the beginning of the deployment surrounded them so often that their very survival was in doubt. ""Restrepo"" teaches without preaching or taking a position on the wisdom of the Afghanistan war. As you listen to the men and watch them on their perilous patrols you learn that theyve been forced to make the best of severely limited resources. Far from constituting an overwhelming force theyre underequipped chronically exhausted dangerously isolated and haunted by their losses. (A few months ago U.S. troops withdrew from the valley after suffering 50 combat fatalities.) ""Hearts and minds"" one of them murmurs. ""Yeah"" another replies wryly ""well take their hearts and well take their minds."" This movie will stir your heart and open your mind. Its a group portrait of practicing patriots. Watch the trailer from ""Let It Rain"" from director Agnes Jaoui. Let It Rain ""Whats a feminist?"" a young son asks his dolt of a father in ""Let It Rain"" (""Parlez-moi de la pluie""). ""A woman whos always making demands"" the father replies. His name is Michel hes played by Jean-Pierre Bacri and he isnt the only one without a clue though Michels obtuseness is close to magisterial. This beautifully strange and affecting comedy which Agnes Jaoui directed from a screenplay she wrote with her husband Mr. Bacri is about men who are weak and insecure and one woman Agathe played superbly by Ms. Jaoui coming to terms with the price of being strong. More than that its about people struggling valiantly and not always in vain to bridge the spaces between them. To be more specific about whats going on Michel and his friend Karim (Jamel Debouzze) are trying to make a documentary about Agathe whos the only successful woman they know a novelist embarked on a career in politics. (Karim may be the only man in the film with a lucid head on his shoulders.) To be less specific about whats really going on the delicate spirit of the film is captured by a song that runs through it ""Les Passantes"" an exquisite old ballad by Georges Brassens. The song as written is a melancholy recollection of fleeting encounters with beautiful women; indeed its about the evanescence of life itself. Toward the end of the film though when reconnections start to seem possible the song becomes a brashly exuberant anthem played by a brass band from Cuba. Accompanied by this stroke of scoring genius a downbeat tale turns cautiously upbeat without missing a beat. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS Incomprehensibility is a hallmark of many movies that have stood the test of time if not internal logic. Here are three of them ENLARGE The Big Sleep (1946) William Faulkner was one of several writers who adapted this convoluted thriller from a Raymond Chandler novel but Mr. Chandler couldnt help when they came to him for guidance during the production. Humphrey Bogart is Philip Marlowe Mr. Chandlers astute private eye. Lauren Bacall and Martha Vickers are rich spoiled sisters and Dorothy Malone is a seductive bookshop owner. The director Howard Hawks was quoted as saying that ""neither the author the writer nor myself knew who had killed whom."" Clips from the film turned up most recently on a TV being watched by the semiaddled hero of Jean-Pierre Jeunets ""Micmacs."" ENLARGE Beat the Devil (1953) Mr. Bogart again this time married to Gina Lollobrigida and sailing with her on a ship bound for East Africa. The passenger list includes a quartet of uranium swindlers played by Robert Morley Peter Lorre Marco Tulli and Ivor Barnard. Incomprehensible is a gentle way to describe the action. The director John Huston who wrote the screenplay with Truman Capote withheld from his actors any advance knowledge of the plot probably because there was no plot and no script. Legend has it that Mr. Capote worked things out day by day reading to the cast each morning what he had written the night before. ENLARGE Charlies Angels Full Throttle (2003) Hailed almost universally as a milestone on the road to cultural ruin this sequel to ""Charlies Angels"" doesnt pretend to be about anything but showing it shaking it and selling it with huge zest and self-delight. The movie raises MTV-style dada to the status of superheated mama even though toward the end the nonsense wears thin rather than svelte. The angels are played of course by Lucy Liu Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz whose Natalie incompletely clad in white fur rides a mechanical bull in a raunchy bar in northern Mongolia. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Comments click to enlarge Knight and Day Video Rated PG-13  110 minutes  2010 Flying home for her sisters wedding Cameron Diaz gets mixed up with crackpot CIA agent Tom Cruise and together they try to keep a secret weapon from falling into the wrong hands. Cruise and Diaz have worked together before (in Vanilla Sky) but this is their first summer-movie pairing and their star qualities are so similar--dazzling looks good comedic chops complete emotional vacuity--that instead of romantic chemistry they generate a sort of giddy blinding falseness. Director James Mangold (Walk the Line) has the good sense never to let the harebrained plot stop moving though the movies biggest asset may be Cruises shrewd exploitation of his screw-loose public persona.

Tom Cruise flirts with self-parody as a slick lunatic in Knight amp; Day. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 23 2010 1154 AM Cheerful yet Vaguely Malevolent Tom Cruise flirts with self-parody in Knight amp; Day. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Knight amp; Day check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. So I know were supposed to experience each movie objectively as a discrete and isolated entity but Knight amp; Day (20th Century Fox) was exactly the wrong movie to see the day after Toy Story 3 a film made with immeasurable quantities of care conviction and love. By contrast Knight amp; Day cuts so many corners that its a surprise theres any paper left in the middle. This romantic-action-spy-thriller lazily relies on our presumed good will toward its stars Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz; our familiarity with older and better action movies (the Bourne and James Bond series in particular); and our low midsummer expectations. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Whoever read the last draft of the oft-rewritten script never even bothered to check whether the title made sense which it doesnt. ""Knight"" it eventually comes out is one of the aliases and possibly the real name of Cruises character who goes by Roy Miller. It would have been easy enough to surname Cameron Diazs character ""Day"" for the sake of parallelism but instead shes June Havens. You cant help but wonder whether some assistant mentioned this discrepancy in a story meeting only to be quashed by the confident assertion ""Ah no onell notice"" Advertisement That misplaced self-confidence is exactly whats so aggravating about Roy Miller. He doesnt need to answer for his motivation his origins his reason for being. He just flashes that set of outsized mah-jongg-tile teeth in his disturbingly ageless face and jumps astride another vehicle careening through the streets of Salzburg or Seville or wherever the protagonists of this globe-hopping yet strangely incurious travelogue happen to find themselves. Even though Knight amp; Day wasnt written for Cruise--a recent Times piece tracked its journey through the hands of Adam Sandler Chris Tucker and Gerard Butler--in its final version the film reads as a kind of treatise on the state of Cruise-itude in our time. The character of Roy Miller is so quintessentially Cruise-ian that he skirts the edges of self-conscious parody. Hes an indestructible superspy whos bottomlessly cheerful and yet vaguely malevolent. Roy seems to lack any interiority whatsoever; even when hes telling the truth he appears to be lying. (Cruises most memorable characters have tended to be liars Jerry Maguire the kid in Risky Business the unstable self-help guru in Magnolia.) This moral ambiguity is a source of considerable confusion to June who after boarding a flight on which everyone but she and Roy is mysteriously killed gets caught up in a web of international intrigue involving a ... perpetually self-recharging battery. But Roys moral murkiness baffles us the audience even more. Long after June has decided to throw caution to the wind and trust this slick grinning lunatic were still hedging our bets. Should she trust him? After all this is a guy who when he has trouble persuading June to accompany him on the next leg of his journey slips her a roofie and spirits her to the Austrian hotel or uncharted tropic isle of his choice. Though were meant to construe Diazs character as tough--shes a tomboyish sort who loves to fix up old cars--June comes off as a remarkably passive heroine a woman who loves guys who love guns too much. James Mangold the director of Walk the Lineand 310 to Yumafilms action by wildly cutting back and forth hoping to confuse us into thinking something exciting is going on. Only one stunt a car chase that takes place in the middle of the running of the bulls in Pamplona is visually coherent enough to be impressive. Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise in Knight amp; Day And yet ... Knight amp; Day isnt entirely unlikable. Theres something retro and Saturday-matinee-innocent about its cheerful incoherence and relentless forward motion. Though the body count is very high--when in doubt Roy Miller just kills everyone on the premises--the PG-13 violence is cartoonish and gore-free. And Diaz can be very funny when given the chance; in a scene where her character has been given a truth serum she pulls off some screwball ditziness. Otherwise she spends much of her onscreen time sleeping and screaming. Tom Cruise for his part can still dependably produce unlimited quantities of Tom Cruise-ness a natural resource undiminished and virtually unchanged since its discovery in 1983. The question for the 2010 audience is whether we have any use for it anymore. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Jun. 23 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jun. 24 2010 326PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Knight and Day Directed by James Mangold Written by Patrick ONeill Starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz Classification PG When a star has achieved the controversial mega-wattage of Tom Cruise its often difficult to separate the performance from the personality. In Knight and Day Cruises first lead role in two years the 48-year-old actor plays a charming but possibly mentally unstable man. The casting may be reasonably construed as a send-up of his own reputation as both a control freak and possible kook. Unavoidably anything Cruise does these days now comes with a lot of baggage (the Oprah couch-jumping comments about psychiatry as a ""Nazi science"") which makes the first scene of Knight and Day particularly appropriate. It takes place around the baggage security check at the Wichita Kan. airport. We first see Cruises character Roy scoping the other passengers before he arranges to collide with a woman June (Cameron Diaz) who is pulling a heavy carry-on bag. Then he collides with her again when they both have cleared the security gates and a few minutes later they find themselves seated together in an almost empty plane. Text by Katie Hewitt. Click here to view at full size. Directed by James Mangold ( 310 to Yuma Walk the Line) from a screenplay by Patrick ONeill Knight and Day makes a laboured attempt at Hitchcockian wit and glamour in the mode of To Catch a Thief or North by Northwest. The filmmakers put most of their chips on the chance that audiences will be entranced by the romantic pairing between Cruise as a government agent who may or may not have gone rogue and Cameron as a tomboy vintage-car restorer who becomes his kidnap victim. They race through a disorienting series of chase sequences in tourist-friendly locations as shadow agents in dark suits and cars chase them around the world in search of a ""perpetual energy"" device the size of a cigarette lighter. None of it makes any sense but the strategy here is that the tongue-in-cheek lightness of the movie will be infectious enough to make us overlook the inconsistencies. The first of the succession of action set pieces occurs shortly after June finds that she and Roy are among the handful of passengers on a flight she had been told was sold out. She immediately starts seeing him as a romantic conquest. Later when she goes to the washroom Roy gets into a gunfight and kills everyone on board the plane including the gun-toting flight crew. For some reason June is not overly concerned. After Roy crash-lands the jet in a corn field she has the first of several blackouts when Roy slips her a drug. This becomes a repeated comic plot cheat as June keeps getting knocked out and waking up in some new improbable location - the Swiss Alps; Seville Spain; a remote tropical island; even her own Boston apartment. Not only does the trick get tired this mixture of black comedy and romance feels ill-conceived. Junes attraction to Roy is intentionally inappropriate with its suggestions of abduction and date-drugging. Diaz does a lot of hysterical shrieking in the first half of the movie before starting to look sparkly-eyed at Roy when they hit the posh European hotels. She finally confesses her lust after shes been hit with a dose of truth serum. Throughout Roy remains sociopathically calm as Cruise flashes his famous choppers in the midst of torture flying bullets or somersaulting SUVs on the highway. Cruise has played unbalanced characters before - in Magnolia Collateral and Tropic Thunder - but the ambiguity here about whether hes in or out of control is carried on long past all sense as the body count rises to alarming heights. A little more time developing why these strangers come to care for each other might have helped and ultimately its a failure of script more than performances. A collection of first-rate actors in subsidiary roles includes Paul Dano as a shaggy science nerd the superb Viola Davis ( Doubt) as a federal intelligence chief Marc Blucas as Junes slightly dim old beau and Peter Sarsgaard as Roys pursuer. Theres no time for any of them to establish credibility in this fragmented pell-mell plot. Mangold proves a competent if unspectacular action director; the use of digital help is sometimes too obvious especially in a misplaced bull-running scene inexplicably moved to Seville from Pamplona. His larger problem is trying to hold together a movie that jerks about in tone as much as it does location veering between grisly humour and cutesy sentiments. Knight and Day wont do anything to alter Tom Cruises reputation which may be the point - but it wont do much for his resume either.

At least on screen that is.As a rogue CIA agent in the zippy romantic thriller ""Knight and Day"" the enigmatic actor plays to his strengths by showcasing his charisma athleticism and -- best of all -- devilish twinkle in those killer baby blues.Considering Cruises spotty recent track record -- the barely decent ""Valkyrie"" the hysterical ""Tropical Thunder"" and the preachy ""Lions for Lambs"" -- the international Golden Boy must be itchin to slug one outta the park.

Fortunately ""Knight and Days"" blunders arrive late and are negligible A couple of scenes show the strains of working overtime in a film that till then is charmingly breezy.The reason director/co-writer James Mangolds (""310 to Yuma"" and ""Walk the Line"") carefree homage to globe-trotting capers like Audrey Hepburns ""Charade"" works so effectively has more to do with teamwork than plot. Everyone realizes what the goal is a light-hearted action-packed thriller anchored by a cute romance crazy stunts and clever one-liners. A tall order to execute but obviously there are pros at work on ""Knight and Day.""The plot is pure malarkey. Perky June Havens (an adorable Cameron Diaz) unwittingly becomes tethered to renegade Roy Miller (Cruise) after bumping into him at the Wichita Kan. airport. The two cozy up while on a curiously empty flight that erupts into chaos (the funniest scene) once June visits the restroom.Advertisement When she returns she discovers that the dreamy guy with the killer smile is lugging around a carry-on stuffed with issues. Not only is he being hunted by CIA operatives (""An Educations"" Peter Sarsgaard and ""Doubts"" Viola Davis) pursuing a mysterious device called ""The Zephyr"" (clever nod to Hitchcocks MacGuffin plot device) but Roy appears to be cuckoo and trigger-happy. Before June knows it shes pulled into the vortex of his insane but exciting world. This goofy setup opens the door for Mangold to stage tautly choreographed fights on planes trains and automobiles (the most exciting takes place in the thick of Boston traffic) as the duo get chased here there and everywhere. All of this makes ""Knight and Day"" grand mindless fun. Yet its greatest success hinges on the chemistry between the leads. Cruise and Diaz make a gorgeous pair and have a potent on-screen connection. When they swoon we want to swoon and sigh right along with them. (And by the way Diaz wins the title of the Best Baby Blues.)After so many bad romance movies its a treat to see genuine sparks fly between two major stars. That the budding relationship evolves over the course of bullets die-hard assassins and chiseled torsos increases the pleasure.""Knight and Day""H1/2Rating PG-13 (for sequences of action violence throughout and brief strong language)Cast Tom Cruise Cameron Diaz Peter Sarsgaard Paul Dano and Viola DavisDirector James MangoldWriter Patrick O""NeillRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top  FAQ Article commenting how-tos and tips Most ViewedMost E-Mailed(From the last 12 hours)Lake Tahoe Warmest water temperatures ever recorded threaten famed...Santa Clara 15-year-old girl killed five injured in crashNHRA Top Fuel driver Steve Torrence sets a national markSan Jose Man fatally shot by robber he was chasing police say1 San Diego cop killed another wounded in shootingPowerball jackpot grows to 478 million but mania is nowhere to be...(From the last 12 hours)Lake Tahoe Warmest water temperatures ever recorded threaten famed...Brisbane With identity at stake small town debates massive housing...29 flights to Las Vegas if you buy now fly later this yearSan Jose New Jewish preschool opening next month in Rose Garden News Videos >> Top Classifieds Copyright (c) - San Jose Mercury News Place an Ad | About Our Ads | Help/Contact | Site Map | Advertise | Home Delivery | Copyright | Privacy Policy and Terms of Use | About MediaNews Group | RSS | Find San Jose jobs | Ethics Policy | About Bay Area News Group | MediaNews Group - Bay Area News Group Privacy Policy  |  Terms of Use  |  MNG Corporate Site Map  |  Copyright",http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment-headlines/ci_15344854?nclick_check=1,200,knight&day13,knight&day,mercurynews

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Planes Trains amp; Automobiles"" could easily have been the title of ""Knight and Day"" the action-romance starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. A jet crashes in a cornfield. A knife fight takes place on a speeding locomotive. Cars flip explode careen. Most improbable however is this Like that 1987 comedy this hybrid adventure directed and co-written by James Mangold (with Patrick ONeill) has its utterly silly moments. Im still not sure it works but wont suppress a smile when recalling the number of bizarre places it takes audiences. Roy Miller (Cruise) is a lethally talented agent whom the powers that be no longer trust. Hes got an invaluable device they want. Hes hidden the whiz who invented it. Agency Director George (Viola Davis) has charged Millers colleague Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard) with bringing Roy in or bringing him down. June Haven (Diaz) rebuilds American muscle cars. Shes got eyes the color of the Caribbean Sea and when she and Roy meet at the Wichita airport shes been buying car parts to finish her deceased fathers GTO a wedding present. The meeting isnt as innocent as June imagines. While shes in an airplane bathroom giving herself a pep talk about dating hes dispensing with assassins. Soon they both are in the crosshairs. And the rest of the globe- trotting ride is one of trust and mistrust flight and fight. When theyre not dodging Millers fellow agents theyre being hunted by a Spanish arms dealer (Jordi Molla). ""Knight and Day"" is a balancing act. Like June audiences have their doubts about Roy. But those misgivings cant tip over into rank suspicion too hard or too quickly. Tweaking our nagging unease is Cruise. While some will liken Roy Miller to Jerry Maguire Cruise also brings a bit of the sociopath he played so very well in ""Collateral."" Cruise knows crazy; it twinkles in his eyes. Spies are terrific liars. So should June trust Roy really? Paul Dano portrays genuis Simon who has an inhaler in his pocket (hell need it) and a head full of theorems that are game changers in the energy field. The flamenco-inflected score at the movies opening recalls the ""Oceans"" romps. Mangold directed ""Walk the Line"" and the remake of ""310 to Yuma."" He hasnt the gift for souffle that director Steven Soderberg does. Thats OK. Cruise and Diaz show up for work when Pitt and Clooney show up to play. The stars each have chemistry of their own starting with their smiles. Their first kiss doesnt pack a lot of heat. But in the end the stars make an argument for goofball heart. ""Knight and Day"" aims to fulfill his- and-her multiplex fantasies. Junes the kind of gal who knows ""Kansas has the best scrap."" Metal that is. Roys the sort of fella who takes a moment -- in a hail of bullets typically fired by him -- to compliment her. More than a few action sequences require a tutorial in Pink Panther physics. Perhaps you recall that in the opening of that cool cats cartoon series he used to step out of an elevator just before it smashed to the ground eluding death and defying Sir Isaac Newton. Roy is as hep as that cat when it comes to evading disaster. He is even more death-proof than ""Mission Impossible"" agent Ethan Hunt. Whats impressive about all this is ""Knight and Day"" doesnt feel cynical. Give into the ridiculousness and ""Knight and Day"" is frisky fun.

Knight and Day (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Knight and Day (PG-13) Action looks fake but Cruises giant ego is all too real. Roy (Tom Cruise) and June (Cameron Diaz) race through the streets of Seville Spain. Photo Frank MasiTM and (c) 2010. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald6/24/2010 Editor rating 1 Tom Cruise spends much of Knight and Day looking as if hes waiting for someone to pour casting mold over his head to make an action figure. When hes not flashing a blindingly fake grin hes sporting a variation on the ``Blue Steel look Ben Stiller perfected in Zoolander. Cruises co-star Cameron Diaz fares better because the movie requires her to shriek and wave her arms a lot which shes good at and to walk around in a bikini or a yellow bridesmaid dress and black cowboy boots a combo she really sells. Too bad though that whenever the characters stand still to talk Knight and Day induces stupor in the viewer. And the action scenes which are intentionally preposterous and over the top and meant to be borderline comical are just ridiculous. A motorcycle chase through the streets of Spain during the running of the bulls is a great idea. A motorcycle chase through the streets of Spain during the running of computer-generated bulls is not. An early sequence involving speeding trucks vans motorcycles and a tunnel had the potential to be a mini-classic. Director James Mangold (Walk the Line) stages the action so things happen unexpectedly at the edge of the frame startling you -- except that most of it looks like a video game. When Diaz verbally references Grand Theft Auto shes not kidding. There are so many CG and green-screen effects in Knight and Day the movie could almost pass for Sin City II. In one scene Cruise and Diaz are driving in a car having a conversation and the exteriors through the windows look so fake you wonder if Mangold was paying homage to Hitchcocks love for rear projection. Hes not though. The only thing Knight and Day pays homage to is Cruises enormous ego. The actor is playing a character who is essentially unplayable Roy Miller a super-super secret agent who makes 007 look like a playground sissy. Roy can outrun computer-generated jets. He can fly computer-generated planes. He can magically transport unconscious people from the middle of remote wheat fields to the safety of their bedrooms and he can anticipate every move his opponents make as if he had ESP. Roy who may or may not be crazy even appears to be immortal In one scene we see him riddled by bullets and falling into a river and then he shows up a few scenes later unscratched with no explanation as to how he survived. Knight and Day is not intended to be the sort of movie in which logic plays much of a role. But the chemistry between Cruise and Diaz is nonexistent (theres a reason why Cameron Crowe cast them as bitter exes in Vanilla Sky). Cruises considerable magnetism has utterly abandoned him -- anybody could be playing Roy -- and without any character to engage the viewer the film becomes a long slog through slick noisy emptiness. And I mean noisy. In one scene Diaz who plays a gearhead who specializes in restoring old cars gets a machine-gun from Cruise so she can defend herself against baddies. Suddenly without explanation she starts shrieking holding the trigger down and waving the weapon around like a marching baton spraying bullets everywhere. Diaz can play a lot of roles but shes too smart for screaming ninnies. They dont suit her and neither does this movie.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Knight and Day Action comedy. Starring Tom Cruise Cameron Diaz and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by James Mangold. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Knight and Day"" is a high-functioning entertainment machine guaranteed to please just about everyone who isnt determined to be grumpy. It places two charismatic stars in an engaging action-filled story set in a variety of glamorous locations about a woman inexorably drawn into the sphere of a rogue government agent - an agent who looks great and can do absolutely anything because hes played by Tom Cruise. He seems poised to break one of the unwritten laws of cinema that action movies just dont work once an actor is in his late 40s. Before that age men are footloose and can do anything on screen but by 47 or 48 guys begin to look like ""Why is Daddy still getting into fights with everybody?"" But at 47 Cruise looks at most 42 - and thats in close-up in direct sunlight - and though he appears in one scene eating an ice cream cone he hasnt been eating many of those in his off hours. This man has been working out like a monster. Give Cruise credit Nobody works as hard - nobody else would ever work this hard - at being ""Tom Cruise"" than Cruise.

KNIGHT amp; DAY As the danger escalates during their global adventure June Havens (Cameron Diaz) finds herself increasingly drawn to the mysterious Roy Miller (Tom Cruise). Photo Frank Masi SMPSP Twentieth Century Fox Movie review Knight and Day revs up gusto 1 / 2 Back to Gallery As a screen energy Cameron Diaz is as scattered as Cruise is focused as open as he is covered and as clearly benign as he is shady. When she smiles you know everything is all right. When he smiles you have no idea what hes thinking. His charm disarms but it doesnt reassure - which is all a long-winded way of saying that these two make a very good and complementary pair. The early scenes are a delight particularly one on an airplane in which she sees this handsome stranger as a possible romantic connection while hes aware that hes surrounded by enemies - and that at any moment they might make their move. Equally amusing is the ongoing revelation of our heros abilities as well as his unfailing politeness in the most harrowing of circumstances. If the movie has a weakness its that once you get the gag you get the gag. The movie establishes a pattern in which every time Roy (Cruise) shows up all hell breaks loose. And then it keeps repeating the pattern. The concomitant suggestion that with each encounter June (Diaz) grows in confidence and competence feels like an arbitrary construction there to support a sense of narrative movement. Fortunately the structural sameness is balanced by genuinely witty action sequences that also create a rooting interest. The banter is fairly diverting too especially as delivered by actors who are naturally funny. She asks ""Are those the bad guys?"" He answers ""No. Worse guys."" The locations are straight out of a Rick Steves travel video - Seville Salzburg - and director James Mangold milks them for all their glamour and allure. Peter Sarsgaard looking like he has a bad taste in his mouth but enjoys having a bad taste in his mouth plays the rival agent on Cruises tail. He might be the movies true villain; but then again it might be Cruise. Hmm. Sarsgaard or Cruise Sarsgaard or Cruise ... Lets give this one lots of thought. In the end ""Knight and Day"" isnt really about much of anything besides having a good time or perhaps the meaning of Tom Cruise-ness in the universe. But sometimes movies are interesting for what they say when the filmmakers think theyre saying nothing - thats when they reveal what they consider to be self-evident. Very much in keeping with the public mood ""Knight and Day"" tells audiences that no one is to be trusted especially organized power i.e. governments business crime syndicates. As for the rest all youve got are your instincts. -- Advisory This film contains violence.

Huh? As different as night and day? Its like one of those made-up movies that Elaine and Jerry would go see on Seinfeld. More about Knight amp; Day >> Happily this big-budget summer offering which has undergone numerous name changes and plot and casting iterations in its long trip from spec script to screen works better than its title. Knight and Day is a slick but jaunty take on a genre that includes the refined Charade (Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn) the rollicking Romancing the Stone (Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner) and the recent Killers (Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl) a genre in which an accidental couple tumbles into dangerous hugger-mugger but manages to stop running long enough to notice the mutual attraction thats going on. Cruise and Diaz -- teamed previously in the 2001 surrealist suspenser Vanilla Sky -- are Roy Miller and June Havens. Hes cool and affable and as soon revealed some kind of secret agent. Shes flaky but self-assured and restores vintage muscle cars for a living. They bump into each other (literally) at the airport in Wichita where hes got a ticket for a flight to Boston and shes booked for a later plane -- but manages to squeeze onto this one. ""Sometimes things happen for a reason"" Roy says meaningfully. And sometimes things happen because there wouldnt be a movie otherwise. As anyone whos seen the trailer knows (it saps the surprise out of some of the movies snappiest moments) the excitement onboard isnt restricted to the in-flight movie menu. By the time the 727 sets down -- in a cornfield -- the only passengers left alive are Roy and June. And by the time they meet up again the next morning in Boston (her hometown) a fleet of black SUVs filled with G-men is in hot pursuit guns ablazin stunt people a-jumpin and a-leapin. From Boston the action -- all terrifically staged and shot -- hops to New York then the Azores the Swiss Alps Austria Germany Spain and South America. Spies get around and Roy clearly is one. But is he a rogue spy? A good guy? Or maybe just a psycho who spent way too much time studying the Bourne trilogy? June doesnt know and neither do we. (Although its not hard to guess Cruise a baddie? Nah.) But the mystery provides momentum and gives Diazs character a necessary degree of wariness. Smartly directed by James Mangold whose previous fare -- Walk the Line; Cop Land; Girl Interrupted -- bore considerably more weight and gravity Knight and Day works despite its familiar feints and stock supporting characters. Theres Simon Feck (Paul Dano) an eccentric young brainiac whose invention a self-energizing battery provides the movies MacGuffin. Theres Agent Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard) the grim colleague on the hunt for Roy and Viola Davis as the no-nonsense Agency boss. Dano Sarsgaard Davis--its an impressive roster loaded with indie cred and at times you wonder how they kept a straight face in the thick of this cloak-and-dagger hooey. (But hey thats their job.) Cruise brings that inimitable Cruisiness to the proceedings. No longer boyish certainly he nonetheless projects a cocky charm. And he hurls himself into the action Unless theres sophisticated CG face-pasting going on much of the running leaping whacking and scrambling appears to be performed by the star himself. And Diaz works that trademark mix of ditziness sexiness and brassiness whether shes in a canary-colored bridesmaids dress (with cowboy boots) or perched backward on a fancy motorcycle spraying automatic-weapons fire at a fleet of vehicles in revved-up pursuit on the cobblestone streets of Seville. Knight and Day isnt going to change the course of history but its better written than most studio-brokered projects (Patrick ONeill gets sole credit but a good half-dozen scribes reportedly had their mitts on it) and none of those involved seem to be taking themselves too seriously. The locales are luxe the banter witty the bullets fly. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Knight and Day | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; knight-and-day ) Knight and Day (United States 2010) June 22 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The action/comedy genre has grown in popularity over the past couple of decades but it remains difficult for filmmakers to find a workable balance between the seemingly disparate elements of the recipe. Too much action often results in marginalized and unfunny humor; too much comedy often results in dull and suspense-deprived action. Fortunately James Mangold whose diverse resume includes the likes of 310 to Yuma and Walk the Line hits upon a workable mix for the ingredients. Knight and Day plays like part-homage/part-parody and while the storyline does not hold up on close inspection it works ""in the moment"" because the chases and fights are filmed with energy and A(c)lan and because the actors achieve the romantic intangible often referred to as ""chemistry."" Knight and Day opens in an airport with June Havens (Cameron Diaz) trying to talk her way onto a Boston-bound flight in order to be back early for her sisters nuptials. On the way to the gate her path briefly crosses with that of a charming guy who identifies himself as Roy Miller (Tom Cruise). They re-connect on the flight but Roy turns out to be more dangerous than one might suspect from his smile. He is either (a) a dangerously unstable rogue agent who is hell-bent on selling a major technological device on the black market or (b) an honest super-spy who has been set up by an unscrupulous co-worker. The fact that he kills everyone on the plane except June before crash-landing the aircraft and drugging her into insensibility argues more strongly in favor of (a) than (b). But the man pursuing Roy an FBI agent named Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard) doesnt inspire unquestioning devotion either. So when Roy lands on the hood of Junes speeding car as it careens down the freeway while being chased by gun-happy Federal agents she has to make a snap decision whether or not to trust him. Perhaps the most important aspect of an action romantic comedy is tone and Knight and Day captures the appropriate blend of whimsy and excitement. The action sequences are well choreographed and never so long that they become boring the romance between the two leads is neither too cute nor too snarky and the comedy is more often amusing than not. I was strongly reminded of Shane Blacks underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which does a lot of the same things for a slightly more mature audience. (This movie is rated PG-13 while Kiss Kiss Bang Bang deserves its R.) Theres also an element of Mr. and Mrs. Smith here although Id argue this movie does a better job with the action/comedy mA(c)lange than that one. The more closely one examines the storyline of Knight and Day the more obvious the holes become but the movie isnt designed to stand up to close inspection. Its intended to be enjoyable without overtaxing the brain and it easily achieves that goal. For the first time in a long time Tom Cruise regains the form that made him one of the biggest box office stars of the late 80s and early 90s. Watching the ease with which he slides into this role and the effortlessness with which he lampoon his Mission Impossible character its not difficult to forget the actors sometimes irrational off-screen behavior. This is vintage Cruise with the smile and the devilish twinkle in his eye recalling Risky Business and Top Gun. He is well-matched by Cameron Diaz who seems re-invigorated here. Movies like Knight and Day rely on a strong unforced rapport between the leads and thats what is in evidence a coupling of playful sexuality and genuine affection. If Cruise and Diaz didnt seem to enjoy each others company the movie would fall on its face. Knight and Day offers a stronger first half than second. The movie is at its best when the audience is in the dark and because our perspective is Junes and she doesnt know what the hell is going on until well into the proceedings thats when things are the most entertaining. Often in monster movies the more we see of the creature the less frightening it is. In Knight and Day the more we learn about Roy Miller and the truth regarding his involvement in a major technology caper the less interesting the story becomes. The final half hour is fueled primarily by the interaction between Cruise and Diaz and occasional flashes of irreverent humor. Knight and Day endured a turbulent road to the screen undergoing various cast and director changes before Cruise and Mangold came on board. The screenplay was shepherded through a number of uncredited re-writes (including one by Scott Frank) before it was deemed to be up to the standards of those involved in the production. There were also numerous re-shoots some as recent as a few months before the release date. Often that much churn leads to a disjointed production but not here. Knight and Day flows smoothly and like a milkshake on a hot summer day it goes down cool and easy even if the calorie count is a bit high.

After weeks of flaunting its sexy stars in an unavoidable ubiquitous marketing campaign Knight and Day arrives as a curious pastiche of spare parts from romantic action movies past - in some cases the very recent past.Youve probably seen the ads. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz meet in a cute way blind each other with charm and set about flying driving shooting and running into all kinds of trouble. Hes Roy either a dangerous federal agent gone rogue or a dashing rake framed by corrupt peers. Shes June just a regular girl from Wichita who realizes her dormant sense of adventure. Roy needs to protect a young scientist (Paul Dano) who has invented the ultimate MacGuffin. June just wants to get to her sisters wedding. They both have really nice teeth. Movie Information Knight and DayRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector James MangoldStarring Tom Cruise Cameron Diaz Paul Dano Peter Sarsgaard Viola Davis Jordi Molla and Marc BlucasRun time 110 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (sequences of action violence throughout and brief strong language)Synopsis A Midwestern woman gets caught up in the antics of an international man of mystery in this action film.More movies from GuideLive.comThe action starts strong and cheeky enough as the smitten June primps in an airplane bathroom plotting her next move while her new amour is engaged in lethal hand-to-hand combat with the other passengers. Its a clever use of screen space and a promising setup for one of those ""Who is this guy?"" movie romances.Cruise and Diaz are both easy to look at and they work well together; their chemistry was the best thing about the otherwise misguided Vanilla Sky. Cruises glibness is a good fit on a character assigned to act as though hes strolling in the park as chaos and very clean murder fill the screen and by now the standard Cruise repertoire of ""arent I handsome"" poses - the toothy smile the bemused reaction shot the slow smolder - are but further reminders that summer is movie-star season.Of course summer is travel season as well. Our dynamic duo hops from place to place from Boston to Brooklyn from a tropical hideaway to a train barreling through Austria and ultimately to Spain to rendezvous with an evil foreign arms dealer (why does there always have to be an evil foreign arms dealer?) and have some fun with the running of the bulls. Every once in a while Roy drugs June for her own safety which gives Diaz the chance to wake up in a series of new outfits.The characters dont get jet lag but we sure do. Give the stars some credit for maintaining high energy and staying in character through much (sometimes intentional) silliness but after a while Knight and Day starts to act like a dog chasing its own tail through a series of increasingly improbable set pieces. After about an hour the movies casual emptiness and proscribed mechanics switch from pleasant diversion to numbness and fatigue.It doesnt help that Knight and Day seems to be stitched into a sort of Frankensteins Movie from the parts of other films. Some of them - Killers Mr. and Mrs. Smith and the Bourne franchise - are fairly recent. The more embarrassing derivatives come from a better vintage. I dont begrudge director James Mangolds attempt to re-create the crop-dusting sequence from North by Northwest. But this scene like too much of the frenetic action in Knight and Day  has an antiseptic CGI feel. Its too clean and easy to conjure any sense of danger. Then were back to the program. Knight and Day may be like a ride but in the end its more merry-go-round than roller coaster. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Knight and Day No funny business here | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesKnight and Day No funny business hereCameron Diaz spends most of her movie reunion with Tom Cruise trying to figure out whats going on. We sympathize.Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz star in Knight and Day  (FRANK MASI / SMPSP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. June 22 2010Knight and Day (out of 4)Starring Tom Cruise Cameron Diaz Peter Sarsgaard Paul Dano and Viola Davis. Directed by James Mangold. 100 minutes. At major theatres. PGCameron Diaz spends most of Knight and Day trying to figure out whats going on and in this we can all sympathize. Her reunion with her Vanilla Sky co-star Tom Cruise is being sold as a comedy and Diaz tries to be funny. But serious cookie Cruise acts as if hes in another chapter of his Mission Impossible franchise. Funny doesnt come naturally to him and his attempts at humour always have the creepy feeling of forced hilarity. Cruise cant stand to lose control even in jest.Article Continued BelowThere is supposed to be romance in Knight and Day -- and Diaz is up for it -- but Cruise still looks as if hes taken charisma lessons from Al Gore. Diaz is just a gal who wants to have fun; Cruise wants us to know he worked really really hard and he has no time for foolishness.Then there is the title which makes absolutely no sense apart from nodding to the 1980s action movies and TV series that the film takes its cues from. The ""Knight"" part of the title is explained rather dully but the ""Day"" part never is. (The original title Wichita would have given the picture a bit of the intrigue it so badly needs.)At least we can all agree that Knight and Day is an action movie and lordy does it ever move. From the moment we first spot Cruises determined Roy Miller scoping out Diazs ditzy June Havens in the Wichita Kan. airport its as if someone drained their bodies of blood and replaced it with Red Bull. Every possible conveyance short of a rickshaw will soon be used by the hotly pursued Roy and June beginning with an aircraft that mistakes a cornfield for a landing strip.We quickly suss that Roy is some kind of tightly wound spy and June is an auto mechanic with high mileage and high-maintenance needs. Roy flashes his perfect pearlies at June not to induct her into the Mile High Club but for some Very Serious Reason we will eventually learn but wont care one jot about. Thats the other big problem with Knight and Day bad chemistry being the first concern. Director James Mangold (Walk the Line) and rookie screenwriter Patrick ONeill take such a casual approach to plot they might as well have just filmed Cruise and Diaz jumping on a trampoline for two hours.The movie is a series of frantic episodes the intent of which is to keep the eye moving and the brain in neutral while magic bullets whiz pass our non-cooing couple and take out the marauders who keep popping up at every turn. The body count is appallingly high even by spy movie standards and its all the more disturbing after we learn that Cruise is a government spook who has ""gone rogue"" (he swears he was set up) and that the people hes killing are mostly his fellow Americans. Hes being chased by his former G-Men conferes led by an officious Peter Sarsgaard and a furious Viola Davis.Diaz never really gets a chance to display her ample comedy smarts apart from a scene where shes administered a truth serum (one of many times shes drugged in the film) and gives up more truth than anyone expected.The movie is based in America but travels to Spain and Austria locations that were evidently chosen for tax considerations and not for any serious filmmaking intent.Knight and Day has one of the more useless McGuffins of recent vintage an item frantically sought by the characters that the audience couldnt care less about. Its an all-powerful battery built by a needy and nerdy junior Einstein (Paul Dano) who may have stumbled upon the secret of perpetual motion. Funny I thought Knight and Day had already discovered that.Im reminded not in a good way of Cruises performance in the prologue to Austin Powers Goldmember in which he actually put his stiffness to good use by pretending to be Austin Powers. He was almost funny especially since he was paired with Gwyneth Paltrow another person for whom mirth does not come running.Knight and Day tries to stretch the same over-the-top idea to feature length and that really is an impossible mission.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Knight and Day review Cruise becomes a shining Knight in amour |       NJ.com comments Knight and Day review Cruise becomes a shining Knight in amour Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 22 2010 at 437 PM updated June 23 2010 at 529 AM View/Post Comments Frank Masi/Courtesy Twentieth Century FoxRoy (Tom Cruise) and June (Cameron Diaz) prepare for the ride of their lives as they flee pursuing assassins and bulls through the streets of Seville Spain in ""Knight and Day."" All we really know about Tom Cruise is what we dont know. Oh we used to think we knew him -- big smile looked good in Ray-Bans played cocky guys with daddy issues had Rosie ODonnell mooning over him as ""my Tommy."" But over the last few years that changed. He started to seem off. He jumped on couches. He talked too much laughed too loud. Everything -- right down to the ODonnell ""crush"" -- felt like an act. And the fun ""Knight and Day"" uses that brilliantly. In this slam-bang action comedy Cruise is a dazzling American spy whos trying to protect the inventor of a powerful new technology. Or maybe sell that technology to the bad guys. While protecting innocent Cameron Diaz. Or maybe using her as cover. Who is he really? Hes whoever he wants to be right then. And on some level that plays beautifully on our own confusion as to what Tom Cruise is really all about. Movie Review Knight and Day (PG-13) Fox (110 min.) Directed by James Mangold. With Tom Cruise Cameron Diaz Peter Sarsgaard. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Stephen Whittys review THREE STARS Directed with lively style by James Mangold ""Knight and Day"" -- awful title by the way -- is the movie ""Killers"" only dreamed of being jumping energetically from Boston to the Azores to Austria to Spain and keeping the tension at a boil with over-the-top action. It has another advantage over the Ashton Kutcher/Katherine Heigl film This movie stars Tom Cruise/Cameron Diaz. Like Heigl Diaz is asked to do way too much panicky squealing; unlike Heigl she still radiates a warm almost giddy approachability as if shes one margarita ahead. She makes us want to watch her which is a real movie stars indefinable -- and yet defining -- power. It is good that the film has her (and Cruise at his most relaxed in years) because the movie isnt to be taken seriously. Nor does Mangold take it seriously. The best running gag has Cruise slipping Diaz a mickey whenever the couple is in impossible peril. What the device also does is allow the film to suddenly fade out and fade in again once theyre out of danger -- and without any explanation as to how Cruise managed it. Hey howd we get . . .Shh not now. Never mind. Run Its like the scene in ""North by Northwest"" when Hitchcock had revving planes drown out a boring expository speech -- because he knew the speech was necessary but unsatisfactory. Some of ""Knight and Day"" is unsatisfactory too. It would be better if Cruise were a more slippery character constantly changing in Diaz eyes from hero to villain and back again. (The old Cary Grant charmer ""Charade"" did this perfectly.) Theres some bad special-effects work and of course the plot doesnt hold up under a moments scrutiny. But wisely ""Knight and Day"" rarely affords you that moment. Instead it just keeps charging forward jumping from continent to continent introducing villains in shifts (including the shifty villain Peter Sarsgaard) and blowing things up with panache. And when all else pales giving us the pretty face of Cameron Diaz movie star and the pretty fascinating spectacle of Tom Cruise playing a character or playing ""Tom Cruise"" -- or maybe doing both at once.

TRAILER Check out a bit of Knight amp; Day FILM PIONEERS Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith spawning Knight is one example Its a quintessential movie hybrid a romantic thriller with exciting high-speed chases brisk comedy and exotic scenery. And perhaps best of all stars Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz make a surprisingly charming couple. The movie starts off strong during a daffy and dangerous airplane flight. Think Airplane starring Jason Bourne. Though there were reshoots and a rumored eight screenwriters (Patrick ONeill gets credit for the script) the film has a consistent wit and energy likely attributable to the steady directorial hand of James Mangold (Walk the Line). While a few too many action scenes feature Cruise running in his distinctive arm-pumping style -- bringing to mind his similar racing around in the Mission Impossible movies -- the stunts and eye-popping maneuvers are deftly executed. How Cruise interacts with Diaz is the key to this action comedy. He plays Roy Miller a special agent on the run. Diaz is June the owner of a Boston garage and a good-natured cipher. She is sucked into boarding his flight after an encounter at the airport. When authorities warn that Roy is a dangerous fugitive she doesnt know whom to believe. We feel her confusion because were also unsure if Roy can be trusted. His kind deeds intensify our investment in his enigmatic yet endearing character. Cruise subtly captures Roys longing for normalcy while Diaz nails Junes girl-next-door appeal. Roy is gentle with only two people among the dozens he encounters June and Simon (Paul Dano) a young scientist/inventor. Watching Cruise and Diaz fend off stampeding bulls and elude bad guys as they zoom around the streets of Seville on a red motorcycle is a heap of fun. They have an easy banter amid almost non-stop action. The globe-trotting adventures of June and Roy her surprisingly chivalrous knight are engaging even if the twists dont always make sense and the villains are cartoonish. And the story falters toward the end when the premise is stretched thin. But in a lackluster summer Knight shines as an original that thankfully lacks 3-D projection sequel connections or comic-book associations.

"Movie review Knight and Day - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MovieMovie review Knight and DayTom Cruise shows hes a star in the entertaining romantic caper with Cameron Diaz Peter Sarsgaard Viola Davis and Paul Dano.June 23 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Why is everyone giving Tom Cruise such a hard time? Cant we just forget about what happened on Oprahs couch? Is that asking too much? Is the movie business so flush with charismatic stars who can carry a picture that it can afford to eat its young? I dont think so. If you doubt Cruises skills in the star department ""Knight and Day"" should make you a believer. Its hardly a perfect film not even close but it is the most entertaining made-for-adults studio movie of the summer and one of the reasons it works at all is the great skill and commitment Cruise brings to the starring role. A genial romantic thriller that very much wants to be in the mold of such Alfred Hitchcock entertainments as ""North by Northwest"" and ""To Catch a Thief"" or even Stanley Donens ""Charade"" ""Knight and Day"" is inevitably light on plausibility but with Cameron Diaz Peter Sarsgaard Viola Davis and Paul Dano joining Cruise it is strong in the acting department. ""Knight and Day"" is also fortunate to have James Mangold in charge. As he demonstrated in ""Walk the Line"" and ""310 to Yuma"" Mangold is one of the few current directors who has an instinct for reasonably intelligent popular entertainment. His films dont end up on 10-best lists but you walk out of them feeling youve gotten what you paid for and that is an increasingly rare commodity. As those credits indicate Mangold also works well with actors and he and Cruise completely understand the old-fashioned movie star charm necessary to animate top-drawer secret agent Roy Miller someone who does everything better when hes wearing sunglasses. Even the films first shot with everyone out of focus but Miller underlines his position as ""Knight and Days"" indispensable man. Patrick ONeills energetic script involves a classic movie MacGuffin Hitchcocks famous name for the ultimately irrelevant plot element everyone on screen is after. Here its the Zephyr a tiny battery created by wacky Gyro Gearloose-type inventor Simon Feck (Dano) that is apparently ""the first perpetual energy source since the sun."" What ""Knight and Day"" is really about however is Millers burgeoning relationship with June Havens (Diaz) beautiful but a bit scattered when our hero glimpses her in a Wichita Kan. airport. Miller first views this blond in cowboy boots who restores old cars simply as a civilian he can use in his ongoing battles with the hordes who are after him. But before you can say ""Boston Salzburg Seville"" the secret agent takes on 12 armed opponents in an elaborately choreographed battle on a 727 and the two of them are flying all over the world trying to escape not one but two sets of adversaries. Most pressing is the CIA Millers old outfit whose ranks are under the impression that our man has gone rogue. The excellent Peter Sarsgaard makes for a wonderfully oily villain reminiscent of the irreplaceable James Mason and Viola Davis adds welcome dramatic heft as the CIAs director of counterespionage. Also in on the hunt is the foreign arms dealer no self-respecting thriller can afford to be without. In this case hes the dread Spaniard Antonio Quintana (Jordi MollA ) a man with access to an unlimited supply of ruthless assassins. Diaz supplies her own kind of charisma as the innocent floundering in waters way over her head. Shes a good counterweight to Cruise (both apparently did a lot of their own stunts) even though the script does have her panicking a lot and screaming things like ""Please stop shooting people."" ""Knight and Day"" also features a ton of action including a wild car and motorcycle chase through Sevilles winding streets. Though it can seem at times as if the film is throwing too much at us too often (Hitchcock is dead and hes not coming back) it is fittingly Cruise who inevitably comes to the rescue. For Roy Miller is not only a peerless action machine; he is also an unflappable and unfailingly polite gentleman always ready with a comforting remark or a compliment no matter how chaotic the situation. Cruises charming facility with Millers deadpan spy-side manner is this films secret weapon and yet another reason why we should put Oprahs couch in storage once and for all. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTodays TV highlights SaturdayJune 4 2011Fox to sneak-preview movie Knight and Day to generate...June 19 2010Ice Age Dawn of The Dinosaurs; Battlestar Galactica...October 25 2009A serviceable if rather pat thriller on tortureOctober 19 2007Projecting the year at the moviesJanuary 16 2005MORE STORIES ABOUTMovieSecret AgentKnight And DayPeter SarsgaardCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-knight-20100623,0,2500779.story",200,knight&day24,knight&day,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its been close to 30 years since Tom Cruise first donned the Wayfarers in Risky Business but here he is again in Knight And Day and nothings changed--not the sunglasses not the shit-eating grin not the air of supreme self-confidence that carries him from the first frame to the last. In spite of the many hairline cracks in his veneer of cool--his performances in Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia his very public meltdown the natural persistence of middle age--Cruise continues to pretend hes on top rather than revealing himself as slightly vulnerable and human. As a rogue secret agent in Knight And Day Cruise is thrown into many sticky situations with legions of trained assassins surrounding him on all sides but he never once suggests that things arent entirely under control. Its profoundly boring to watch a hero without weaknesses; after all even Superman has Kryptonite. Knight And Day gets off to a reasonably promising start as Cruise flirts with everywoman Cameron Diaz on a commercial flight to Boston otherwise populated exclusively by agents he intends to kill. Director James Mangold (Walk The Line 310 To Yuma) takes his time establishing a nice rapport between the two while building tension for the melee  to come. When Diaz returns from the bathroom and discovers that everyone but Cruise is dead it sets up a potentially uneasy situation over who to trust. Cruise later warns her to run from officials using buzzwords like ""safety"" and ""security"" which isnt that reassuring If Cruise were really a danger to her wouldnt Diaz expect her protectors to use the same language? Sadly everything is much simpler than it seems. Questions over Cruises intentions give way to a transcontinental chase in pursuit of the worlds most amazing battery with Diaz just whisked along for the ride. Peter Sarsgaard and Viola Davis are underutilized as Cruises adversaries Paul Dano lets a scraggly mustache carry his performance as the McGuffin-maker and the plot doesnt twist or turn so much as link one poorly orchestrated action setpiece to the next. Throughout it all Cruise doesnt allow even the single bead of sweat that dropped in Mission Impossible to escape his pores; hes clinging hard to that last rung of superstardom hoping no one will notice his hand is slipping.

Cameron Diaz follows Tom Cruises lead in Knight and Day (Frank Masi) C+ Knight and Day Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Tom Cruise Cameron Diaz Peter Sarsgaard; Director James Mangold; Release Date Wide 06/23/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 110; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted June 23 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Lighthearted on the surface yet cold at its core the action comedy Knight and Day hops the globe from Boston to Salzburg to Cadiz. But even the remarkable sight of bulls running through Spanish streets -- real bulls real Spain big budget -- is eclipsed by the monumental scale of the heads of Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz the stars who play boy-secret-agent meets girl-next-door in this studied exercise in romantic spy-jinks. Jeepers but their heads are big -- Easter Island-statue big In the very first shot of the very first scene set in the Wichita Kan. airport where Roy (Cruise) is in transit undercover the entire horizon is momentarily blotted out by the back of the actors noggin. We admire his haircut at our leisure. Eventually the camera pivots so we can appreciate Cruises magnified cheekbones his teeth his choice in sunglasses. Then Roy strategically bumps into June (Diaz) a restorer of classic automobiles (you got a problem with that?) on her way to her sisters wedding in Boston. The couple lock gazes; they were strangers once but no more. (Cruise and Diaz worked as costars nine years ago in Vanilla Sky.) And lo were temporarily blinded by the size of Diazs blue eyes and the expanse of her pink lips as they fill the frame. Anytime Roy and June share a scene -- which is often since Knight and Day presumes a belief in an attraction between the two -- director James Mangold goes for an extreme close-up first of his famous mug then of hers. A mere mortal might be reduced to whimpers by such scrutiny. These guys they just glow. I dwell on scale and shot choices because nothing in Knight and Day is accidental. In this oddly uninvolving caper the size of skulls makes its own statement The producers assume that audience interest in movie stars is bigger than audience interest in characters. The conclusion is overdetermined since Roy and June are such flimsy constructions. Unfortunately sustained cranial study also leads to the awareness that Cruise and Diaz share little besides visual square footage. Certainly nothing intrinsic about Diazs June -- characteristically sunny casual and sprawling the line between wholesome lass and sexy mess -- appears to interest Cruises typically precise controlled impermeably well-groomed Roy who even when being ""funny"" comes across as a man on a mission. The duo emit no whiff of mingled sexual musk as they collide. Yet here the pair are fatefully bound together by predicaments she didnt ask for (which only partly accounts for why she shrieks so girlishly in extremis) and which he doesnt have time to explain as he kills bad guys with ostensibly amusing efficiency. At least theyre not Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher in Killers. Meanwhile Mangold the sophisticated student of cinematic language and genre reference who made Walk the Line and 310 to Yuma dutifully tweaks conventions of the James Bond canon the Bourne trilogy and Cruises own Mission Impossible outings favoring quick angular action edits and the typographic flash of international datelines. Working with screenwriter Patrick ONeill Mangold also sneaks in a party-clever visual reference to Hitchcocks The Lady Vanishes involving misted breath on a train window and a verbal shout-out to Frances legendary Hotel du Cap where the director once held a press conference for his 1997 film Cop Land during the Cannes Film Festival. Were treated to fancy car chases in which Roy and June are pursued by adversaries including Peter Sarsgaard as a dogged charmless government agent. For very few scenes and for no good reason except that its always great to see her recent Tony winner Viola Davis plays a no-nonsense CIA boss. Paul Dano has a small sweetly silly role as a nerd-genius inventor -- no great stretch there. Its nice and old-school indeed that the movie used real locations real cars and real dangerous stuntwork under the photographic direction of cinematographer Phedon Papamichael who shot Mangolds excellent 310 to Yuma; I like it when a bull is a bull. Then again publicized boasts that Cruise and Diaz did a lot of their own action scenes mean little. Why are physical training and stunt authenticity so often hyped as actorly assets? Who cares how a star learned an arcane skill to play make-believe? Its not the sight of Tom Cruise leaping a tall building I want to see its Tom Cruise becoming someone whos not Tom Cruise. All those close-up shots signal that despite applauding the stars enthusiasm for engaging in risky business Knight and Day plays it awfully safe.

"Movie review of Knight and Day washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Style >> Follow Style On MOVIE REVIEW Movie review of Knight and Day YOU HAD ME AT BANG Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise delight in the action-romance flick. (Frank Masi/associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday June 23 2010 Roy Miller is in his own words good at what he does. He isnt bragging. If anything the secret agent played by Tom Cruise in the utterly delightful action film/romcom ""Knight and Day"" is probably selling himself short. A master of hand-to-hand combat who can put a bullet exactly where he wants it -- shooting someone in the leg to immobilize him while avoiding the femoral artery so as not to kill him -- hes also unfailingly polite when on the rare occasion he goes too far. ""Sorry"" he tells an innocent bystander he has just decked with the lightning-quick reflexes of a ninja. ""I thought you were making a move."" Its no wonder June Havens (Cameron Diaz) falls for him when they meet on her flight from Wichita to Boston. Hes cute charming smart funny and almost freakishly competent. Too bad that trouble in the form of gun-toting government agents and an arms dealers ruthless henchmen are following him -- and now her -- all over the globe as Roy tries to protect a nebbishy inventor (Paul Dano) and keep his top-secret invention out of the wrong hands. But exactly whose are the wrong hands? According to the feds who are chasing him (led by Peter Sarsgaard and Viola Davis) its Roy whos the bad guy an unstable untrustworthy rogue agent. While Cruise was born to play the part -- a modern-day MacGyver who by his own admission has been trained to dismantle a bomb in the dark ""with nothing but a safety pin and some Junior Mints"" -- it also seems just possible that the guy might be ever so slightly deranged. The actors couch-jumping Scientology-pumping past actually helps here add a layer of unpredictability to a character who in almost every other aspect is a kind of Superman. Forget Roys martial arts expertise. Nobody particularly at 47 should have abs that look that good when he takes his shirt off (which is often). But this isnt just ""The Tom Cruise Show."" As an ordinary woman inadvertently caught up in a world of jet-setting espionage Diaz makes a delicious comedic and romantic foil to Cruises Roy. Yes at first shes a little freaked out by the number of people who are dropping like flies all around him -- Roys aim is deadly when he wants it to be -- but she soon shows herself to be a capable partner. ""Youve got skills June"" Roy tells her admiringly after she shoots out the tires of a pursuing car. Compare her performance to that of Katherine Heigls ditz in the similarly themed ""Killers."" Diaz is no damsel in distress here. And her gumption lends fizz to an already effervescent production. It helps that the script by Patrick ONeill is as lively as the action. Roys schmoozing patter is a mix of cheesy small talk and spy-movie cliches ""Open the door June"" he shouts while clinging to the windshield of the speeding car shes driving. ""Beautiful dress by the way"" he adds. Roys unflappability is a thing of wonder but its also the source of much of the films humor. ""Knight and Day"" you see isnt just another ""romaction"" hybrid. Its both straight-faced spy film and sly spy spoof. Thats a difficult balancing act but director James Mangold (""310 to Yuma"") gets it exactly right. He lets us in on the joke even as he lets us enjoy every thrill-packed minute of the ride. Knight and Day    109 minutes at area theaters is rated PG-13 for action violence mild obscenity and brief suggestive humor.

(Frank Masi SMPSP) Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday June 22 2010 214 PM Title Knight and Day There are several reasons to assume ""Knight and Day"" is a smarter-than-average action comedy. It was made by James Mangold whose resume includes the Oscar-winning ""Walk the Line."" Leads Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are seasoned experts who can seduce audiences with little more than a smile. And Patrick ONeills script is so convinced of its own cleverness youll be halfway through before you wonder if youre missing something.Youre not. Despite its impressive pedigree and unshakable assurance ""Knight and Day"" is nothing more or less than an average popcorn flick. Thats not to say you wont have a decent time just that youll have forgotten it by the next morning.After meeting cute at the airport June (Diaz) and Roy (Cruise) board the same plane to Wichita. Minutes later hes killed every other passenger before landing the aircraft himself. As she stares in horror he calmly explains hes safeguarding the worlds most powerful energy source -- a battery created by Paul Danos shy geek.Unfortunately since June now knows about it various villains (including Peter Sarsgaard) keep trying to kidnap or kill her. Her only hope Roy insists is in sticking by his side.Cruise is in overdrive here working like crazy to entertain us (and perhaps prove at 48 what a reliable action hero he is). And Diaz uses all her resources finding new ways to shriek and be saved. (""Killers"" Katherine Heigl who thoroughly botched the same thankless assignment should take notes.)So theres little energy left for sparks between the two especially since Mangold is focused on moving things briskly enough to distract from the gaping plot holes. Whenever its impossible to get out of a jam for example he and ONeill simply shift to the next scene and with so much confidence you may not even notice their deception.A sheen of professionalism clings to every element from the international chases to the stars performances. But look just beyond the slick gloss and youll share Junes dawning realization things arent exactly as they seem. Roy she believes is even more special than he appears. His movie unfortunately cant claim the same. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

In fact theyre taking ticket-buyers for a ride.       Photo AP ( ) Youre a 30-something woman flying home to your sisters wedding and a cute guy youve just met assassinates all of the other passengers on your plane as well as the pilots and crashes it into a cornfield. Shortly thereafter this charmer kidnaps you -- to ""protect"" you from the bad guys he says -- wounding your ex-boyfriend in the process. Telling you that other people will claim hes a mentally unbalanced rogue CIA agent your new friend with the killer smile repeatedly drugs and undresses you while dragging you around the world where he kills many dozens of armed pursuers while neither of you suffers barely a scratch. MORE ON KNIGHT AND DAY ON THE POSTS MOVIES BLOG Do you (a) try to escape at every possible opportunity or (b) help this guy while quickly falling in love with him? After a few moments of half-hearted resistance the woman in the overproduced alleged action comedy ""Knight and Day"" takes the latter route. And its for no other plausible reason than hes Tom Cruise shes Cameron Diaz and this is a big dumb summer movie with no apparent ambition other than plugging a hole in a studios schedule because its faded star happened to be available for a few weeks. Am I being too tough? Sure comic action thrillers -- even great ones like ""North by Northwest"" and ""Charade"" both fumblingly referenced here by director James Mangold (""Walk the Line"") not to mention ""True Lies"" -- require a certain suspension of disbelief. ""Knight and Day"" though is one of those movies that requires you to accept that every single time a character is presented with a choice he or she will make the worst and most inexplicable one. This would possibly be more forgivable if the stars were given actual characters to play rather than being forced to coast on screen personas (hes cocky shes ditzy) that seem increasingly dated for Cruise who will turn 48 next month and Diaz who will be 38 the following month. It would also help if they were given some dialogue that was actually funny or at least more clever than the lines provided to Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl in the distressingly similar ""Killers"" from earlier this month. It also wouldnt hurt if a few surprises were sprinkled into an ultra-predictable plot that seems to have been cranked out by a computer screenwriting program without significant human input. Its not as if the director actually made interesting use of extensive location shooting in places like Austria Spain and Bermuda which are deployed so unimaginatively that the studio could have saved a bundle and shot the whole thing in Vancouver like ""The A-Team"" did. Instead we get endless close-ups of Cruises grin in a winking performance that seems to be nudging us in the ribs and reminding us roughly every 30 seconds that ""Hey look Im spoofing my testosterone-charged persona and my real-life reputation as a guy a few cards short of a full deck."" Diaz is more flatteringly photographed than in some of her more recent films but theres nothing more than a token effort on her part at making her characters motivations plausible. Basically she either screams or looks at her ""Vanilla Sky"" co-star from 2001 adoringly. Even the more technically proficient actors on hand -- like Peter Sarsgaard and Viola Davis (as CIA operatives) and Jordi Molla (as a Spanish arms dealer) -- dont make much of an impression in cardboard roles. While he gets minimal assistance from the script Paul Dano does manage a few bemused moments as an eccentric physicist whose invention a high-tech battery is supposed to be propelling the plot. Those moments are more than welcome in a movie like ""Knight and Day"" where even a herd of stampeding bulls real and CGI manages to seem utterly boring. I can only assume the film ratings board was lulled into such a stupor watching this movie that they didnt notice this PG-13 movie has a body count far exceeding many that receive R ratings. Not that you feel Tom or Cameron are in any actual danger for one millionth of a second. loulumenick.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Action Jackson Read Next Action Jackson Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 31723 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 27400 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 16608 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Im beginning to think jumping up and down on Oprahs couch may have been the smartest thing Tom Cruise ever did. That stunt coupled with assorted other weirdnesses circa 2005 redefined the stars public persona from real-life action figure to borderline cultural embarrassment but its hard to deny the Teflon Tom image was due for an overhaul. (How many real-life rescues can one actor pull off?) Toward the end of the decade with his bizarrely hilarious fat-suit cameo in ""Tropic Thunder Cruise acknowledged he was in on at least part of the joke and the jut-jawed earnestness that had established him as a box-office sure thing had been replaced for better and for worse by a new unpredictability.In ""Knight and Day its mostly for the better. The movies a piece of high-octane summer piffle stylish funny brainless without being too obnoxious about it and Cruise is its manic animating principle. Whenever he zigs or zags the film races to keep up with him jettisoning cars helicopters and human beings as necessary. At the same time ""Knight tweaks the actors ""Mission Impossible seriousness by giving us Roy Miller a super-spy so capable it makes him giddy with delight. Roys high on himself and for the first time in a Tom Cruise movie were meant to laugh. ""Im pretty good at what I do June he tells the movies heroine and the gag is that for once Roys being modest.Cameron Diaz plays June Havens a nice no-nonsense Boston girl -- she restores vintage cars for a living and from what I can tell lives in East Boston -- who meets Roy on a homebound flight that quickly turns into a neatly choreographed action-movie parody the agent dispatching a plane full of baddies while Junes in the bathroom hyperventilating after flirting with him across the aisle. The sequence sets the stakes for ""Knight and Day -- things happen much too quickly for us normals to take in there will be casualties were not meant to take them seriously and whatever happens Toms on top of it.Roy is a federal agent protecting the films twin MacGuffins -- a perpetual energy source no bigger than a battery and the doofus young scientist who invented it (Paul Dano with weedy facial hair) -- from a team of rogue agents led by Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard who doesnt look at all happy to be here). June is collateral baggage forced to come along for the ride after she and Roy meet cute while landing that plane in a cornfield. Believability is not this movies strong suit but fledgling screenwriter Patrick ONeill and director James Mangold (""Walk the Line ""310 to Yuma) work like crazy to keep you from caring. So weve got ""Romancing the Stone with spies instead of treasure hunters ""Charade with ADD; its diverting while youre watching it and completely forgettable afterward. This is one of Diazs better recent roles though and it plays to the actress strengths of likable comic anxiety and breezy romantic intrigue. It takes awhile but June gives as good as she gets. One of the movies crueler running jokes is that Roy keeps giving her knockout drops to carry her out of the plots tighter fixes and through the haze she and we catch brief glimpses of absurdly baroque action sequences that hop from plane to parachute to desert island. By the end Junes not quite Mrs. Smith to his Mr. but shes enough of an equal to turn the tables in satisfying fashion.But ""Knight is a movie that thinks nothing of dropping its characters in Spain just to run with the bulls and away from the villains or that indulges our local audiences with a balletic high-speed shoot-out through the highways of downtown Boston. (The fantasy lies not in the flipping cars and trucks but in the notion that any traffic could move this fast on the Southeast Expressway.) After 40 minutes or so of casually destroying our fair city the movie moves on to Salzburg Seville the Azores; tax credits or no its flattering to think were in the same league.Subsidiary characters come and go -- Marc Blucas as Junes twerpy firefighter ex-boyfriend Jordi Molla as an international arms dealer Viola Davis as an FBI handler -- but theyre as critical to ""Knight and Day as the plot line which is to say not at all. Though the movie feels awfully dumb once the buzz wears off you may not mind. Cruise is the whole show and Diaz the audience surrogate who gradually gets to play along and thats flattering too. The twinkle in the stars eye still looks as self-satisfied as always but theres a gleam further back a spark of vaguely disturbing anarchy that turns the smugness into comedy and that keeps everyone else in ""Knight and Day off-balance. Because weve seen Tom Cruise go bonkers on ""Oprah we know hes capable of anything. He knows it too and its liberating.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Knight and Day Fair to good Director James Mangold. Cast Tom Cruise Cameron Diaz Peter Sarsgaard. Rating Rated PG-13 for sequences of action violence throughout and brief strong language. RELATED Spotlight Tom Cruise Spotlight Cameron Diaz Action comedies Spy movies Happily after a leisurely set-up director James Mangold doesnt let the action slow enough for that kind of thinking. Instead youre more likely to have fleeting thoughts such as ""Tom Cruise is really good at this kind of thing"" or ""Even Cameron Diaz isnt bad"" between ridiculously fun action sequences. ""Ridiculous"" being the operative word here. Cruise plays Roy Miller a seemingly winning fellow who is either a secret agent trying to protect a new source of energy at any cost or a psychopathic killer gone rogue. The fact that he is willing to take down everyone on an airplane and the plane with them lends credence to the latter theory - as does Cruises performance a wild-in-the-eyes affair that carries the entire film. Roy bumps into June Havens (Diaz) in the Wichita airport - twice. She winds up on the same ill-fated flight with him despite his rather cryptic warning. This takes a little while to get going but once the flight takes off so does the movie and it never looks back leaving believability somewhere back there in Wichita. Soon Roy and June are on the run trying to elude Agent Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard) and catch up with boy genius Simon Feck (Paul Dano). They travel all over the world in what seems a matter of hours and Mangold working from a script by Patrick ONeill accelerates events in a way that is either a perfect representation of how current action films are made or a demonstration of everything thats wrong with movies today. Maybe its both. In short he cheats. In times of extreme duress Roy drugs June which is sort of creepy. Then Mangold operating from Junes in-and-out-of-consciousness perspective fast-forwards through events that would evidently take too much effort or too much skill to explain fully. Thus a lot of loose threads are left hanging though occasionally it works to good comic effect as when she woozily sees Roy swinging upside down in and out of frame bound at the ankles assuring her that things may look bad but hes got everything under control. And he does. Whatever the sins of the movie - the casual killing of dozens of people in an offhand way chief among them though the tacked-on romantic elements are no great shakes either - are for the most part softened by Cruises assured performance. An underrated actor Cruise gives Roy the confidence a man who is willing to leap from a speeding motorcycle onto the hood of a speeding car in the middle of a freeway would surely need all with a glint in his eye that says hes not taking the whole thing too seriously. Either that or he really is crazy. Works either way. Sarsgaard and Viola Davis as his boss are good as youd expect though their roles are small. Diaz is fine better after June gets dosed with truth serum. But how you feel about ""Knight and Day"" will depend largely on your feelings about Cruise. If you cant divorce his performance from his off-screen antics well thats a problem here and elsewhere. If youre willing to watch whats on-screen and leave it at that theres fun to be had.

The locations change as often as the outfits in ""Knight and Day"" a high-energy low-impact caper-comedy that labors to bring a measure of wit romance and glamour to an overworked spy-thriller template. Busy when it should be fizzy and rather too fond of using a barrage of bullets or sudden blackout to cut short its so-so comic banter this inelegant contraption still delivers the requisite eyeful mostly by way of Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. Even with star power no longer a B.O. guarantee the Fox release should lure audiences seeking a midsummer escape; fittingly prospects look best overseas. While it resembles and riffs on films as different as ""Charade"" ""Three Days of the Condor"" the James Bond movies Cruises ""Mission Impossible"" pics and even this months my-hubby-the-hitman romp ""Killers"" ""Knight and Day"" primarily intends to be a snappy update of such classic love-on-the-run espionage thrillers as ""North by Northwest"" (briefly referenced here when a plane crashes in a cornfield) and ""The 39 Steps."" Trouble is those films were plenty snappy to begin with and helmer James Mangold and scribe Patrick ONeill as though aware they cant compete in the frothy sophistication department try to compensate by upping the action and the body count to a level of callous brutality very much in keeping with current standards. Shot edited and choreographed in the whiplash style customary for most studio actioners the fisticuffs knife fights and shootouts here are surprisingly rough even unpleasant given the films PG-13 rating. Consequently for all its efforts to approximate a mildly tongue-in-cheek screwball tone ""Knight and Day"" rarely attains the effervescence of its forebears; gunshots and CG explosions keep bursting its champagne bubble. First big setpiece occurs midflight on a near-empty jetliner not long after car enthusiast June Havens (Diaz) finds herself chatted up by suave stranger Roy Miller (Cruise). Its clear to the audience if not June that Roy is some sort of secret agent something he confirms by handily dispatching the pistol-packing flight crew. That includes the pilots forcing Roy to make the aforementioned crash-landing. Back on the ground he coolly advises a very confused June to avoid the FBI agents who are on his tail then slips her a drug -- the first of many instances in which the screen fades to black leaving June to revive in entirely different surroundings. From there ""Knight and Day"" becomes a whirlwind world tour as well as an exercise in prolonged disorientation as June is hauled in for questioning by the feds thrust into a high-speed car chase and forced to operate a machine gun under Roys expert guidance. All this unspools against a continually shifting backdrop of hot spots including Boston; Brooklyn; the Austrian Alps; Seville Spain; and a deserted tropical island while the modes of transport vary from parachute to car carrier to luxury train. Fortunately for June (and the viewer who is likely to feel no less jerked-around) her protector exerts a calming influence and the films most charming notion is that despite Junes uncertainty about whether she can trust this armed and dangerous renegade Roys soothing manner disarming savoir faire and ability to talk her through even the diciest scenarios make him something of an ideal (mystery) man. Casting Cruise certainly doesnt hurt; if Roy initially threatens to be a past-his-prime rehash of ""Mission Impossibles"" Ethan Hunt the star comes off as appreciably less macho and more relaxed achieving a level of nimble assurance the rest of the film only fitfully lives up to. Previously paired with Cruise in ""Vanilla Sky"" Diaz isnt quite her co-stars match here; as written her June is nowhere near as verbally adroit as Roy leaving the actress little to do for the first hour but react hysterically to each new setback and scream girlishly as she miraculously dodges every bullet. But as the circumstances become more inviting the destinations more romantic Diaz loosens up accordingly her performance reaching a giddy high late in the game (abetted by a shot of truth serum). Returning to a contempo setting after two period pictures (""Walk the Line"" and ""310 to Yuma"") Mangold flexes his action muscles with bland technical proficiency yet has difficulty solving the more crucial problem of the scripts tonal inconsistencies. Papering over the cracks somewhat is the surging accompaniment provided by John Powell by now a pro at scoring spy pics (""Fair Game"" ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and all three ""Bourne"" movies). A scraggly Paul Dano pops up albeit not often enough as the nerdy science whiz who invented the pics MacGuffin a device Roy is trying to keep out of the hands of his FBI colleagues (played by Peter Sarsgaard and Viola Davis both deserving of meatier supporting roles). Making the most of their brief screen time are Marc Blucas as Junes former flame and Dale Dye and Celia Weston whose characters demystify the not-so-clever pun behind the films title.
