This will come as a disappointment to fans of cyberpunk writer William Gibson who penned the adaptation of his short story. Set in the year 2021 when vast corporations rule the world pic features one bit of ingenuity its premise which sees Johnny (Reeves) outfitted with a computer chip in his head so that he can smuggle the highly classified contents from Asia to North America. The amount of information he has taken on is enough to make his noggin explode unless he gets downloaded in short order. Chased by yakuza intent on obtaining the info for a giant corporation Johnny makes his way to the Free City of Newark a dismal urban ruin and endures any number of confrontations assaults and standoffs from those who might profit from the goods carried by the belligerent young man notably a vicious man of the cloth impersonated by Dolph Lundgren. The long-awaited razzle-dazzle of Johnnys downloading is an extended visual trip that seems intended as a modern equivalent to the stargate sequence in 2001 but comes off as so much graphic doodling. Absolutely zero human interest is generated by Reeves who comes off as gruff hostile and selfish all in one dimension.

He looks like a futuristic G.I. Joe and damned if he doesnt have all the personality of G.I. Joe. Reeves plays a ""mnemonic courier"" a freelance human data carrier who has had a computer chip implanted in his brain. Early on he receives a massive injection of information more than twice the amount hes equipped to carry; he spends the rest of the film skulking around with his lobes jammed to capacity all the while evading the Japanese mobsters who quite literally want his head. The very notion of Keanu Reeves suffering from cerebral overload sounds like some sort of bad joke (though one the film itself doesnt appear to be in on). Offhand I cant think of an actor who could use a brain implant more. The trouble isnt that Reeves talks like a surfer dude; its that he tries so hard not to talk like a surfer dude. He lowers his voice by an octave for that requisite macho effect and he delivers almost every line with an intense misplaced urgency as if he were a grade-school kid imitating his favorite TV cop. Johnny Mnemonic a slack and derivative future-shock thriller (its basically Blade Runner with tackier sets) offers the embarrassing spectacle of Keanu Reeves working overtime to convince you that he has too much on his mind. He doesnt and neither does the movie. The depressing thing about these Blade Runner knockoffs is that for every nifty visual detail there are a dozen more -- back-alley shoot-outs Ice-Ts Rasta braid -- lifted from the same old B movies weve been watching for years. Johnny Mnemonic is based on a story by William Gibson the philosopher guru of the wired generation and it was directed by the artist Robert Longo who seems to have taken a perverse pride in reinventing himself as a major-scale Hollywood hack. Most of the film is set in Newark N.J. and the big news about Newark in the 21st century is that it looks like...Newark. I did however like a few of the gimmicks such as the whip of light that slices right through flesh. And Dolph Lundgren makes a vivid impression as a murderous Jesus freak. Its the wittiest touch in the film that Rocky IVs bristle-cut hulk has returned to the screen looking like the psychopathic son of Charlton Hestons Moses.

With its nondescript look hodgepodge cast and dialogue that seems dubbed even though it likely isnt this Alliance production startlingly resembles the polyglot international co-productions of the 70s notably the late unlamented Canadian tax-shelter ventures. Everything seems patched together as if to meet some global commercial prescription not to entertain or advance a coherent view of the future. This will come as a disappointment to fans of cyberpunk writer William Gibson  who penned the adaptation of his short story. Pursuit plot plays like a simple excuse for a vast display of elaborate but undramatic and unexciting computer-graphics special effects designed to show whats inside Reeves head. On the evidence there isnt much. Set in the year 2021 when vast corporations rule the world pic features one bit of ingenuity its premise which sees Johnny (Reeves) outfitted with a computer chip in his head so that he can smuggle highly classified data from Asia to North America. Even though he has had a memory upgrade thanks to which he has lost his recollections of childhood the amount of information he has taken on is enough to make his noggin explode unless he gets downloaded in short order. Chased by yakuza intent on obtaining the info for a giant corporation Johnny makes his way to the Free City of Newark a dismal urban ruin and endures any number of confrontations assaults and standoffs from those who might profit from the goods he carries notably a vicious man of the cloth impersonated by Dolph Lundgren. Since baddies cant kill belligerent young Johnny outright as his brain needs to be kept alive to store the implanted chip they merely want to decapitate him and keep the head going suggesting that the most appropriate title would have been ""Bring Me the Head of Johnny Mnemonic."" Some desultory darkly staged action scenes are a mere prelude to the long-awaited razzle-dazzle of Johnnys downloading an extended visual trip that seems intended as a modern equivalent to the stargate sequence in ""2001"" but comes off as so much graphic doodling. Absolutely zero human interest is generated by Reeves who comes off as gruff  hostile and selfish all in one dimension. Most of the other cast members are seen to equal disadvantage though not at such length. The computer special effects are slick and accomplished but unimaginative and the film itself directed by conceptual artist Robert Longo possesses a gloomy look of unrelieved grimness without any specific character. Overall pics conception of the future isnt terribly original or inventive and viewers not into the head trip of bigscreen computer graphics will want to download a lot sooner than Johnny does.

Johnny the films hero is a ""mnemonic courier"" a 21st century delivery boy for the underground movement. Instead of having a secret compartment in his shoe he has a computer chip in his brain that allows him to store a tremendous amount of information. Written by William Gibson who adapted his own short story and directed by New York artist Robert Longo in his feature debut ""Johnny Mnemonic"" is inescapably a very cool movie. Running at a fevered pace with laser and light explosions it introduces a fantastic yet plausible vision of a computer-dominated age. Related Stories FILM REVIEW -- `Johnny Mnemonic Has a Lot on His Mind For all its cool ""Johnny Mnemonic"" is not cold as so many futuristic pieces are. The film makers keep in mind that no matter how far technology advances people -- for better and worse -- are going to remain human. At heart ""Johnny Mnemonic"" is just a hard-boiled action story using technology as its backdrop. Starring here is Keanu Reeves who is in his own way an arresting actor. Do you believe that Keanu is Johnny? Do you believe that Keanu has a computer chip in his brain? Do you believe that what Keanu is doing up there could reasonably be called good acting? No. No. No. And yet When hes on screen do you want to watch him? Of course. With his sleek handsomeness and that earnest good-dog look in his eyes Reeves is an actor you actually find yourself rooting for. Harrison Ford may radiate integrity but Reeves radiates niceness. Watch any scene from ""Johnny Mnemonic"" with the sound off and thered still be no question whos the good guy. The film is conceived as a race against time. Johnny who has taken on twice the amount of data hes capable of storing needs to download -- and fast. He is the cerebral equivalent of someone with intestinal flu desperately searching for a rest room in a public place. If he doesnt download soon his brain will explode. Meanwhile everyone literally wants his head including Japanese actor-director Takeshi as a crime syndicate leader who hires a wild-eyed hit man (Dolph Lundgren) to chop Johnnys head off. Along the way the film comes up with an array of futuristic underground types for Johnny to deal with. There is Ice-T as a ""low-tech"" guerrilla leader Henry Rollins as a ""flesh mechanic"" who knows all about head implants and pretty newcomer Dina Meyer as a computer-enhanced female bodyguard.

Johnny Mnemonic Movie Review amp; Film Summary (1995) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/johnny-mnemonic-1995,200,johnnymnemonic7,johnnymnemonic,rogerebert
"Johnny Mnemonic (R) Johnny Mnemonic (R) By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer May 27 1995 Dont you just hate it when youve got to download and you cant find a rest stop on the information highway? ""Johnny Mnemonic"" a bleak high-tech no-brainer gussied up with computer graphics explores the consequences of too much input in a future wired for facts but not for wisdom. Apparently this thin violent and unimaginative thriller itself is one of the worst of this phenomenon. Keanu Reeves plays the title role of a sullen courier who smuggles classified information via a computer chip ""wet-wired"" into his brain. To accommodate the extra data he has jettisoned his long-term memory. Still when he agrees to transport a mega-load of input from Beijing to the Free City of Newark Johnny bytes off more than he can chew. Relentlessly pursued by a mob of corporate samurai the courier must find his contact and download in 48 hours or lose both the cargo and his head. He might lose the last anyway as the samurai have orders to place his headbut not the rest of himin cryogenic storage till the chip can be retrieved. Meanwhile Johnny finds a love interest-bodyguard (Dina Meyer) and heroic allies in the LoTeks guerrilla hackers engaged in an undeclared war against the sinister multinationals now dominating the world. The hackers are also after the information which an evil pharmaceutical corporation has been secreting. Its the cure for NAS a fatal neural disease that is now epidemic. Also known as ""the black shakes"" it is caused by ""information overload"" and yet it is also infectious. Whatever. Like ""Blade Runner"" ""RoboCop"" even the French ""Delicatessen"" ""Johnny"" is characterized by a mise en scene that is post-apocalyptic chic. Only this time its not TV or nuclear war or talking computers that have caused the worldwide rot its everybody knowing too much. That notion is positively medieval but it comes from so-called cyberpunk visionary William Gibson who based the screenplay on one of his short stories. ""Johnny"" is a first feature film for both Gibson and director Robert Longo an artist who has dabbled with music videos and their inexperience shows in the repetitiousness of the storyone graphically gruesome fight scene after anotherand the impoverishment of the characters. Even if Reeves could act his character as written would be flatter than a floppy disk. Dolph Lundgren as a born-again hit man does a better job with his role and just might be the best thing in the movie. Now thats real science fiction. Johnny Mnemonic is rated R for profanity and violence.

He looks like a futuristic G.I. Joe and damned if he doesnt have all the personality of G.I. Joe. Reeves plays a ""mnemonic courier"" a freelance human data carrier who has had a computer chip implanted in his brain. Early on he receives a massive injection of information more than twice the amount hes equipped to carry; he spends the rest of the film skulking around with his lobes jammed to capacity all the while evading the Japanese mobsters who quite literally want his head. The very notion of Keanu Reeves suffering from cerebral overload sounds like some sort of bad joke (though one the film itself doesnt appear to be in on). Offhand I cant think of an actor who could use a brain implant more. The trouble isnt that Reeves talks like a surfer dude; its that he tries so hard not to talk like a surfer dude. He lowers his voice by an octave for that requisite macho effect and he delivers almost every line with an intense misplaced urgency as if he were a grade-school kid imitating his favorite TV cop. Johnny Mnemonic a slack and derivative future-shock thriller (its basically Blade Runner with tackier sets) offers the embarrassing spectacle of Keanu Reeves working overtime to convince you that he has too much on his mind. He doesnt and neither does the movie. The depressing thing about these Blade Runner knockoffs is that for every nifty visual detail there are a dozen more -- back-alley shoot-outs Ice-Ts Rasta braid -- lifted from the same old B movies weve been watching for years. Johnny Mnemonic is based on a story by William Gibson the philosopher guru of the wired generation and it was directed by the artist Robert Longo who seems to have taken a perverse pride in reinventing himself as a major-scale Hollywood hack. Most of the film is set in Newark N.J. and the big news about Newark in the 21st century is that it looks like...Newark. I did however like a few of the gimmicks such as the whip of light that slices right through flesh. And Dolph Lundgren makes a vivid impression as a murderous Jesus freak. Its the wittiest touch in the film that Rocky IVs bristle-cut hulk has returned to the screen looking like the psychopathic son of Charlton Hestons Moses.
