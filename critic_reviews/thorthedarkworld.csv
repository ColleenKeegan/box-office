Dave McGinn The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 08 2013 1201AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 08 2013 834AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Alan Taylor Written by Christopher Yost Christopher Markus Stephen McFeely Starring Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Tom Hiddleston Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English with some Elvish Marvel superheroes dont get much down time. Since the giant spectacle of this springs The Avengers weve seen Iron Man suit up in the third film of that characters franchise and now Thor is once again wielding his mighty hammer in Thor The Dark World.Whats the big blond warrior been up to lately? Jane Foster the love interest and astrophysicist played by Natalie Portman sure would like to know. Shes been pining for him for two years now (perhaps Portman is also wondering just whats going on with her post-Oscar career). But even Foster admits that as far as excuses go having to restore order to the nine realms is a pretty good one. video Video Thor and his hammer hits big screen Now that an ancient race of evil elves who look a lot like Tolkien creatures are out to destroy the universe however Thor is back on Earth and in Fosters life. Its almost the time of the alignment when all nine realms will converge. Or maybe its the time of the convergence when all nine realms will align. Its all a little confusing. Whats important to know is that its prime time to destroy the universe evidently. The elves just need to extract the Aether an ancient weapon from Fosters body.Thor tries to spare Asgard from destruction by luring them to the dark world of the title a barren landscape that only an evil elf could love. To do so hell need help from his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the power-mad trickster who stole the show in Thor. Is there decency in him or just more deceit? The great thing about Hiddlestons portrayal of the character is that youre never sure.Theres plenty of intergalactic travel here but the movie only really finds its groove when Thor lands on Earth. Thats where the elves will launch their attack. Where are the rest of the super team from the Avengers when the elves are rampaging in London? Surely that level of destruction must make an alert button on Nick Furys desk beep.Its probably best not to ask these sorts of questions. Director Alan Taylor who takes over from Kenneth Branagh certainly isnt bothered by them.Taylor whose recent credits include directing episodes of Game of Thrones is also smart enough to know that mindless entertainment about a godlike hero saving the universe needs comic relief. Too many superhero movies suffer from an unbearable self-seriousness (Im looking at you Christopher Nolan).Branagh added a few moments of levity to Thor but his interests were always primarily with the characters dramatic Shakespearean elements. When your protagonists father is Odin and his brother is trying to usurp the throne that interpretation is fair enough. But it can only be pressed so far.Taylor saves the picture from self-importance with several great moments of comic relief. It would spoil things for viewers to mention any of these in detail. Lets just say that Loki does a fantastic impression of Captain America and that Thor getting back to Greenwich is arguably the high point of superhero comedy. These touches have a wonderful self-deprecating quality unlike the brand of smarm charm that Robert Downey Jr. peddles in Iron Man which is close to becoming insufferable.There are currently 18 comic-book adaptations slated for release between now and 2018. Yet as the glut continues the genre seems stuck in a dilemma. The post-9/11 context it has used to find meaning is growing stale. But without it the genre risks irrelevance. How it will escape that dilemma is anyones guess but Thor The Dark World is a good model of how superheroes can save the world without forced gravitas and have fun doing it.

"Thor 2 Hammer of the Plods << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Thor 2 Hammer of the Plods Disney Joss Whedon November 7 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Right now were stuck between technology that can pretty much do everything and movies that havent a clue what to do without it. Joss Whedons Avengers demonstrated a way forward for the comic-book movie action-television. Without anything interesting to say these Avengers 2 teasers (or whatever were calling them; ""movie"" usually feels wrong) exist to give hundreds of technicians a lab to advance the state of their art. Youd never call Thor The Dark World experimental even though thats ultimately what it is. The costume department gets to play with fabrics and colors and helmets. The effects teams continue to discover subtle new ways to erase the boundaries between the laws of physics and the version Marvels writers and illustrators use. (Marvel like Grantland is owned by Disney.) And the studio of course gets richer. But for all this experimenting why does no one monkey with the script? Why doesnt the acting get to go off the rails? Why is Chris Hemsworths crown prince Thor still a caped Chippendales dancer? (He does know his way around a throwaway line.) This second installment of the Thor series is the first since last years Avengers so characters are still upset about the evils that befell New York City. The movie toggles between Asgard and London where Thors lady the astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) has been infected with what looks like a computer virus (its called the Aether). Thor brings her to Asgard but his father old Odin (Anthony Hopkins) fears shes just a host and that the Aether is looking for a more destructive home. The first hour of this movie has Tom Hiddleston Idris Elba Rene Russo Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings all giving the same performances they did in 2011 except without Kenneth Branaghs fascinating delusion that he was still directing Shakespeare. Now its boring stuff Im afraid characters hopping from one screen saver to the next. This movie has action but zero intrigue. Even when major characters are dying you dont feel anything. For one thing death doesnt seem to mean anything in these movies. I saw The Dark World with a theater full of young people who clapped after every close-up of Hiddleston -- whose hamminess really is seductive -- and every pummeling. They were like toddlers after half a bag of Skittles. By the time London was being destroyed by the Aethers new host a dark elf called Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) I was with the kids. The climax uses space preposterously (wormholes) and the preposterousness is fun. The effects department gets to show some visual wit and simulate comic-book chaos. But enough with the appetite-whetting experiments. Just wake me when The Avengers Age of Ultron is here.

"Thor The Dark World starring Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Thor The Dark World Is Basically the Crocodile Dundee II of Superhero Films--in a Good Way Thor The Dark World Is Basically the Crocodile Dundee II of Superhero Films--in a Good Way Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 8 2013 548 PM Thor The Dark World The Crocodile Dundee II of superhero films--in a good way By David Weigel Chris Hemsworth in Thor The Dark World. Photo by Jay Maidment/Marvel Studios/Walt Disney Studios In the long important trillion-dollar history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe 2011s Thor represented its first semi-risk. Iron Man the 2008 film that launched the franchise introduced a character who wasnt terribly well-known outside the comic book shop but it starred Robert Downey Jr. right when America needed him back. The Incredible Hulk cast an Oscar-winning actor as pop cultures most famous humanoid monster (non-Frankenstein category) and had only to be better than the movie that made us wonder whether we were wrong about Ang Lee. David Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post. And then Thor. It asked us to get excited about muscular-but-unknown-but-muscular Australian actor Chris Hemsworth playing an arrogant Asgardian god banished to lowly Earth. Its director had previously imagineered a four-hour adaptation of Hamlet. Luckily for Marvel--and with an assist surely from Peter Jackson who had primed the American pump for Norse-ish fantasy--it was a hit. Hemsworth got famous and Tom Hiddlestons Loki was established as a perfectly odious treacherous tragic dreamy villain. Thor spent most of his own movie sulking around mourning his lost power. The people who flocked the following summer to see The Avengers realized that Thor was even more fun when he had better dialogue less pomp and more Mjolnir flying at you in Digital 3-D. If the naive God of Thunder was always going to be betrayed by Loki better to do it while calling his evil brother ""adopted"" (he was) and getting shot out a Helicarrier. Advertisement The Marvel machinists have applied these lessons to Thor The Dark World which is quicker sillier and more violent than its predecessor. Written by the fantasy vets Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who helped shape the Chronicles of Narnia adaptations (and will be tackling the Captain America films next) the new installment advances a story that will be either be finished or further advanced in the Avengers sequel. Alan Taylor who was hired after directing a bunch of Games of Thrones episodes set out to make the Thor-iverse ""richer and edgier"" and he succeeds at the expense of a plot that makes sense when you write it down. A film like this has to start with someone with a British accent explaining mythology to us and TTDW does not skimp. ""Long before the birth of light there was darkness"" says the disembodied voice of Anthony Hopkins back for another residual as Odin. ""From that darkness came the dark elves."" Enter the elves mirthless mask-wearing terminators who want to use a fluid mass of energy called the Aether to cast the universe into eternal darkness (with shades of red) using chunks of it to transform their warriors into invincible beasts. A group of elves large enough to slaughter a demigod earlier in the film is later taken down by a hurled sedan. The dark elves are defeated by Odins father but not destroyed. The best of them led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston glowering magnificently) disappear into sword-shaped spaceships and hibernate for thousands of years until the galaxies are in perfect alignment and the Aether can be recovered from the cave the Asgardians hid it in. Want to guess who finds the cave through an alignment-created portal in the London stockyards? Scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) thats who. Shes spent the years since Thor pining for her absent Thunder God and poking around rocks that just might contain some magic world-threatening CGI goo. The dark elves awake. Havoc ensues from Asgard to Midgard (aka Earth). Thor followed the Crocodile Dundee paradigm the tough guy dazzling people in a new land with his rough manners and strange vest. TTDW is Crocodile Dundee II which put the fish back in his familiar waters dragging his New York girlfriend to the Outback. Jane is brought along to Asgard and Svartalfheim awkwardly meeting Thors parents and learning to wear medieval gowns. Sif the lovely warrior whom Odin wants Thor to marry gets to see the earthling whos stolen her man but the movie isnt very interested in exploring that love triangle. Sure Asgardians might look down on humans--theyre both mortal ""give or take 5000 years"" as Loki snarls--but the humans seem to understand science better than the gods. Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) the scientist from Thor and the Avengers comes up with his third intradimensional high-tech MacGuffin one that can save the universe better than anything Odins come up with. Advertisement We can accept that logic--the ""anything aliens can do we can do better"" trope is too important to discard now. But why does so much else in TTDW depend on bendable logic? The dark elves have been trapped in their spaceships for millennia hibernating in H.R. Giger pods. In all that time the Asgardians havent advanced their society or weaponry? The elvish assault on Asgard pits the elves spaceships against what appear to be magic flying canoes armed with cannons and elvish laser guns against ... spears. Later a group of elves large enough to slaughter a demigod earlier in the film is taken down by a hurled sedan. The elves who get high on Aether are completely invincible until the plot necessitates that they be vanquished by a sword or a good Mjolnir blow. This ""random power level"" problem wasnt invented in one movie. All summer weve been introduced to villains who are unbeatable until the plot needs them beaten from Star Trek Into Darknesss Khan to Iron Man 3s Aldrich Killian. We know that Thor will be around for a dozen or so more Marvel films so we know that Malekith will go down. It would have been more satisfying to see the Asgardians tossed around like dolls--after all if they were any good at being gods theyd be worshiped by more than a few Norwegian black metal bands right? Thor as the one bold Asgardian willing to understand humans to let them teach the gods is the best idea in the series. Hes a meathead maybe but hes smart enough to set about learning what he doesnt know. Humans get something out of the trade too. Skarsgards Erik has become increasingly debased and erratic since falling under (then out of) Lokis mind control. The scientist who has gained an advanced knowledge of the cosmos disrobes and runs around whenever the ""comic relief"" button starts blinking red. He might be a better avatar for the audience then the dazzled wry Jane Foster. Faced with alien invasions techno-terrorists magic Nazis and 10 interlocking superhero movies wouldnt you go insane? ""I had a God inside my head"" mutters Erik rattling his bag of medication as he meets a new character. ""I wouldnt recommend it.""

Really? An extraterrestrial Viking demigod with a magic hammer is not after all the most obvious subject for a mass-market film. Marvel Studios had already beaten the odds by introducing the character in the impressively guffaw-free Thor and then integrating him into the broader Marvel-verse in The Avengers. Why tempt fate?But fate has been tempted and remarkably it has once again been overcome. Though hardly a must-see Thor The Dark World is if anything better than the original a looser loopier hybrid of science fiction and fantasy powered by a pair of magnetic performances and leavened with a number of truly witty moments. Yes the movie spends too much time in Asgard which is (even by comic-book standards) an exceedingly silly place. But for fans of the superhero genre the film is nonetheless a likable diversion.Related Story The Enders Game Movie Is Secretly a Defense of Millennials The story begins thousands of years ago when Odins father (that is to say Thors grandfather) led the forces of Asgard in a war against the Dark Elves who as their name suggests were not nice folks. Their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) had created a superweapon--an otherworldly floating goo called ""the Aether""--but he was defeated before he could deploy it. The Asgardians unable to destroy the Aether decided instead to ""bury it deep where no one can find it."" You can probably guess how well that worked out.Flash forward to the present. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has returned to Asgard leaving his astrophysicist love-interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) behind on Earth. While searching for a way to contact her interstellar hunk Jane stumbles into an alternate dimension where--what are the odds?--she comes in contact with the Aether which enters her body and refuses to leave. Malekith and his crew who unbeknownst to all have been in suspended animation on their starship lo these many years are awakened and come looking for the Aether which they plan to use to destroy the universe (or as the Asgardians like to put it the ""nine realms"") and usher in a new age of darkness.If this all sounds pretty ridiculous well it is. And if it sounds an awful lot like the premise of The Lord of the Rings well its that too. Thor The Dark World often plays like a peculiar mashup of Tolkien and Star Trek--a Balrog here a Romulan Bird of Prey there--with hints of Alien and Hellboy thrown in for good measure. This kind of magical past/technological future crossover is not an easy thing to pull off but director Alan Taylor (a veteran of Game of Thrones) takes the challenge head on. And while I wont go so far as to say that he succeeds--Im not sure that ""success"" is a meaningful concept when it comes to Asgardian starfighters that are shaped like Viking longships--the execution is about as good as one could reasonably hope for.So clever and conflicted that he seems barely able to tolerate himself Hiddlestons Loki is a hero for the antiheroic age of Don Draper and Walter White.The secondhand plot and daft visuals are not in any case the movies main selling points. Rather Thor The Dark World gets by thanks to its heady pace and good-natured charm. Its a considerably funnier movie than its predecessor thanks in large part to Kat Dennings (who returns as Janes intern) the always-amiable Chris ODowd (who shows up as a decidedly underpowered rival for Janes affections) and a sneaky-good cameo by Chris Evans a.k.a. Captain America. The rest of the supporting cast (including Stellan Skarsgard and Idris Elba) does fine as well though Eccleston is given precious little to do other than snarl menacingly beneath layers of makeup and CGI and Anthony Hopkins seems vaguely dyspeptic at the very thought of having to play Odin again.Its Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston however who are the main draws here as the titular thunder god and Loki his deliciously malevolent adoptive brother. When Hemsworth burst upon the scene in the first Thor it wasnt clear whether or not he was the real deal. But following Cabin in the Woods The Avengers and especially Rush his big-screen charisma is no longer in doubt. Theres good reason that he seems to have usurped the film career of his fellow Aussie action actor Sam Worthington (or as I like to think of him the modern-day George Lazenby). As for Hiddleston it is only a modest exaggeration to declare him the genuine star of the franchise. When he derides Thor as ""a witless oaf"" or asks him whether hes sure he wouldnt rather ""punch his way out"" of a difficult situation theres more than a kernel of truth to the jibe. So clever and conflicted that he seems barely able to tolerate himself Hiddlestons Loki is a hero for the antiheroic age of Don Draper and Walter White. (Perhaps the movies best moment is when Thor commands Loki ""no more illusions"" and the latter reveals himself completely.) In this installment Thor and Loki join forces in the battle against Malekith though the alliance is inevitably an uneasy one. ""I wish I could trust you"" laments Thor. Trust schmust Love him for what he is like the rest of us do.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Sanderson on how men and women experience marital satisfaction differently Whenever Im walking around D.C. with friends on sunny Saturday afternoons we inevitably see lots of babies adorable fat charmingly bald babies. Its not uncommon to hear sighs of ""oh my gosh hes so precious"" and ""I want one"" from my companions; I too have been accused of being a baby stalker from time to time. But at The Atlantics One Day University event on Saturday Amherst psychology professor Catherine A. Sanderson made a convincing case that cute kids (and cute husbands and wives) might seem different when theyre yours to keep. She gave a witty lecture on what social science can tell us about happiness and these were my three biggest take-aways First I will no longer have to worry about being awesome if I get married because my husband will probably be happier for having taken vows regardless of how great I am. In studies of marital satisfaction over time Sanderson said ""there is in fact a positive correlation for some people. Guess who those people are? Men. For men yeah being married makes you happier and the good news is it doesnt matter at all who youre married to. It could be like a mail-order bride from Russia--does not matter at all.""

Since Im not a fanboy of the franchise Im at a disadvantage here. It matters little to me whether Thor (Chris Hemsworth) rescues Earth and all nine - count em - realms. Frankly I was kind of rooting for his scurvy brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to carry the day.As their brooding patriarch Odin Anthony Hopkins is still trying as he did in ""Thor"" to lend Shakespearean gravity to kiddie kitsch. At least that first film in the series directed by Kenneth Branagh had some gusto and in the New York scenes a comic edge. The earthbound scenes here in which Thor once again literally sweeps Natalie Portmans Jane Foster off her feet are less original.My favorite moment in the movie Astrophysicist Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) insisting on wearing only his underwear because he says he thinks better that way. Hey whatever works. Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence and some suggestive content.)

"Thor The Dark World | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; thor-the-dark-world ) Thor The Dark World (United States 2013) November 08 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Thor The Dark World offers the kind of straightforward action/adventure yarn that adherents of the genre will appreciate. Its an example of superhero filmmaking 101 at work with high octane fights and special effects-fueled eye candy trumping narrative. The movie is pretty to look at in a Transformers sort of way and moves briskly enough that it never threatens to bore but its hard to feel much of anything about the characters and when its all over theres a sense that everything that happens is obligatory. Thor is essentially Marvels answer to Superman and as with The Man of Steel it can be difficult to craft a tale around a hero who is essentially invincible. The enemy this time around is Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) the King of the Dark Elves who may be the worst developed villain in any Marvel movie. His motives are Blofeld-esque on a grand scale use the power of the indestructible Aether to blast the nine realms back into primordial darkness. Having failed once in the time of Thors grandfather hes back to try again. He has a henchman or two and drives around in space in a really big ship equipped with a cloaking device. Buried under pounds of prosthetics and makeup Christopher Eccleston (who once played the ninth Doctor Who) is unrecognizable. He growls his lines with appropriate Bane-like menace although there arent many of them. It begs the question of why the filmmakers bothered with a ""name"" actor when not even his family will recognize him. As a character Malekith is about as one-dimensional as a villain can be. His backstory is truncated and hes not given enough screen time to be more than passingly menacing. The only thing interesting about him is when he goes one-on-one with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in an admittedly fun battle that has the two of them popping through space from planet to planet (with Thors hammer desperately trying to catch up). The screenplay neatly dispenses with the elephant in the room of ""where are the rest of The Avengers?"" (an issue that hamstrung Iron Man 3) by having most of the action take place off-planet. Asgard is nicely rendered although it seemed more grandiose when Kenneth Branagh envisioned it in the first Thor. This time around director Alan Taylor sees it as a smaller less majestic place. Perhaps thats necessary to the story. The kinds of indignities suffered by the gods this time around might not have worked in Branaghs version of the realm. Two characters enable Thor The Dark World to occasionally transcend the generic mediocrity that defines this endeavor. Tom Hiddlestons Loki making his third appearance has grown so comfortable in the role that hes able to steal every scene in which he appears. Thor The Dark World comes to life when Hiddleston is on screen and his interaction with Hemsworth evidences far more chemistry than the rather feeble spark evident between Thor and his lady love Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). Then theres Kat Dennings sharp-tongued Darcy who is by far the most interesting secondary character not named Loki. Id love to see a movie in which Darcy and Loki team up and go on an adventure - it would be worth the price of admission for the actors alone. Hemsworth like Hiddleston has grown into the role thanks to previous appearances in Thor and The Avengers. Its hard to deny his charisma and the scenes he shares with Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins (as Odin) represent the best Thor The Dark World has to offer. Unfortunately his confrontation with Malekith is CGI dominated. Meanwhile Natalie Portman is disappointingly bland. The actress who is capable of delivering strong performances in the right material is as utterly defeated by the role of Jane Foster as she was by that of Queen Amidala. Stellan Skarsgard has been transformed into pure comic relief running around in his underwear (or less) and acting like a lunatic. Anthony Hopkins and Idris Elba are criminally underused but that was also the case in the first Thor. Their presence provides Thor The Dark World with a patina of cinematic legitimacy no unlike Marlon Brandos inclusion in Superman. Thor The Dark World is occasionally elevated by the moments when it plants tongue in cheek and decides not to take itself too seriously. Hiddleston and Dennings dialogue is often representative of this as are scenes when Thor literally hangs up his hammer or boards a train in the London underground and asks directions. In fact its possible to make a compelling case that the film is at its best when its taking a break from the primary storyline. Thor The Dark World is really just a placeholder to keep fans from losing interest between The Avengers and its sequel. This movie like Iron Man 3 might have worked better had it existed outside the long shadow cast by Joss Whedons massive team up. Once a franchise enters the realm of the epic its hard to satisfy by backtracking and there are only so many times a hero (or group of heroes) can face Armageddon without it becoming redundant. Thor The Dark World delivers in a generic superhero fashion by offering a couple hours diversion (with inter-credits and post-credits scenes to keep butts in seats for the entire running time) but one can be excused for finding the overall experience a little stale.

Nordic downhill Ponderous Dark World lacks charm of 1st Thor 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Thor The Dark World Fantasy adventure. Starring Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins. Directed by Alan Taylor. (Rated PG-13. 120 minutes.) Bigger is not always better. ""Thor The Dark World"" pumps up the action and special effects and loses some of the human element that made the original ""Thor"" (2011) something charming and unexpected. True this sequel gets better as it goes along but thats a very steep climb just to arrive at not bad. That something has gone awry is obvious from the first moments when were dropped into the midst of a battle scene with no idea who is fighting why theyre fighting which side is which or why we should care. Just a few minutes after that we reconnect with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who is shown doing that thing he does - swinging a hammer and killing everybody. Its all rumbling and explosions just the usual action fare. Perhaps the differences between the original and the sequel can be attributed to the directors. The first ""Thor"" was directed by Kenneth Branagh and Joss Whedon whose interests extend from fantasy adventure to Shakespeare. ""Thor The Dark World"" was directed by Alan Taylor a respected TV director (""Game of Thrones"" ""The Sopranos"") in his first attempt at a movie blockbuster. There is also the subliminal matter of the score not an incidental aspect in this case. The music for ""Thor"" was composed by Patrick Doyle who did all the scores for the Branagh Shakespeare films as well as for ""East West"" ""Bridget Joness Diary"" and other pleasing human-scale features. The score for ""Thor The Dark World"" was composed by Brian Tyler who did the music for ""Iron Man 3"" ""Final Destruction 5"" and ""The Expendables 2."" While the difference between the two ""Thor"" movies isnt quite the difference between ""Bridget Jones"" and ""The Expendables"" the truth is somewhere along that continuum. ""Thor The Dark World"" takes place in two distinct locations across the universe. In Asgard where Thor is the prince and heir apparent the land is in turmoil as the good king (Anthony Hopkins - need you ask?) finds himself in endless war with an evil enemy. How evil? Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) wants to destroy not only Asgard but nine other planets including Earth - as in modern-day 21st century Earth. Natalie Portman reprises her role as Jane Foster an American scientist now working in London who is searching for the point of gravitational connection between our planet and Thors. In the process she accidentally comes into possession of a red churning substance thats eternal and all powerful. The rest of the movie is all about Jane and Thor working together to keep the red substance out of the villains hands and about their effort to - what else? - save the universe. As in the earlier movie most of the fun is contained in the Earth sequences in the awkwardness of Thors presence in the modern world in the eccentricity of Stellan Skarsgard driven half mad by his discoveries and in the expert dry delivery of Kat Dennings as Janes assistant. Asgard is a much more stodgy place even stodgier than usual with everyone suddenly talking like Yoda ""You must think I am a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily"" the king says to Thor. He means ""Are you buttering me up?"" The one bright light in Asgard is its darkest soul Thors brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who got all the brains in the Thor family but none of the virtue. He breezes along with an air of uneasy self-satisfaction smug but not completely sure of himself and thus more interesting. Actually in character terms Loki might be the only interesting person in the movie. The battles are huge but of mild impact and this time the stakes are enormous and yet impersonal. Thor and Jane already know each other so there is none of the pleasure of watching them become acquainted. But still the heart and appeal of ""Thor The Dark World"" is in that relationship and as the movie wears on and the focus shifts in that direction the whole atmosphere improves - at least enough to soften the disappointment.

I have disagreed on many in the past but what the heck its not worth losing sleep over how anyone likes or dislikes a movie. Now I personally loved this film and saw it 6 times in the theater. Yes Im 60 years old and read all the comics when I was a kid. I truly feel that Marvel has the recipe for making great super hero movies. Im looking forward to Capt. America 2 Antman/Giantman Avengers 2 reboot of Fantastic Four and hopefully a Hulk with Mark Ruffalo. Pure entertainment at its best Ryan Downssaid on Tuesday November 26 2013 75914 PMWhat about Man of Steel was cool? Crazy Daveysaid on Wednesday November 20 2013 80805 PMFirst Man Of Steel now this??... what happened to you Roeper? You used to be cool sigh Reply from Richard Roeper Davey So if we disagree on a couple of movies Im not cool? Come on I still think youre cool for visiting the site and expressing your opinion Best RR Johnsaid on Friday November 15 2013 12740 AMIve always found Thor to be the WEAKEST of the Avengers(Hawk Eye amp; Black Widow included)so Im not surprised one bit by this review. And whats the obsession with this Tom Hiddleston guy? I mean enough of him already Is Thor that damn dull and boring a superhero he needs this guy to make him seem somewhat interesting? Artinesaid on Friday November 08 2013 25201 AMRichard Ive enjoyed watching your reviews for the past few years now and almost always agree with you say (especially your review of the relatively disappointing Man of Steel this past summer...yes I am a longtime devout Superman admirer). I thought Thor 2 was quite better than Man of Steel (which you gave a C+ where I wouldve gone with C) - I would rate Thor 2 a B...not so lighthearted and humorous as the first Thor and the dialog was not as well written but still an engaging story and eventful sequel with pleasant twists. Youre still the man though Richard Brendansaid on Friday November 08 2013 22402 AMSo when you saw Thor you believed he could hold his own movie and even gave the movie an A. Now hes better letting someone else take the lead...why the change in opinion? The most critical thing you said in your review was that the special effects were sometimes silly and some of the action is redundant. I dont completely see in your review why Thor could hold his own movie before and why this movie convinced you otherwise. Dont take this as nerd hating I actually was more critical of the first Thor movie than you were. I find your reviews to be a breath of fresh air and usually understand why you liked/disliked a movie even though I might disagree. Im lost as to your central criticism of this movie however unless you changed your mind about Thor himself since the first movie. Even then I really dont get why. Davidsaid on Thursday November 07 2013 115254 PMHi Richard. Love your reviews and always respect your criticism. While I do agree with you on some points here I still found the film to be entertaining enough to warrant my recommendation. At least a grade B. Yeah it took a while to find its footing story-wise and the villain and his master plan felt a tad too been there blown up that. Still loved Tom Hiddleston and the rest of the cast was good too with some clever humor and fun action. POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Loki (Tom Hiddleston) left steals some of his brothers (Chris Hemsworth) thunder in the sequel ""Thor The Dark World."" (Jay Maidment) By Michael OSullivan November 7 2013 Is ""Thor"" getting dumber or am I? Im not referring to the Marvel superhero (Chris Hemsworth) a muscle-bound blond himbo whom no one has ever called a deep thinker but to the movie franchise itself. With the release of ""The Dark World"" the second film in the series about the hammer-wielding Norse god -- or the third if you count ""The Avengers"" -- Im left with way more questions than I can answer. For example if Thors homeland of Asgard has the technology to defend itself from space invaders with long-range artillery and jet fighters as we see in the film why do Asgardian foot soldiers still run around with medieval swords and daggers? And exactly how and when did the Bifrost get repaired? That magical bridge between Asgard and Earth was as everyone knows destroyed utterly at the end of the first film. It was still out of commission in ""The Avengers"" leading the screenwriters to offer a bogus explanation for Thors appearance in New York City as the result of his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) pulling some strings. Huh? In the new film the rainbow highway is suddenly good to go again with no explanation. Are Thor and his family divine or arent they? ""Were not gods"" Odin says to his son Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in what may be the biggest bombshell ever to drop in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). Oh really? Someone might want to tell creator Stan Lee who has specifically referred to the Asgardians as divine beings. But most important why do the Dark Elves -- the bad guys in ""The Dark World"" -- look so much like angry Teletubbies? Ow my head. ""The Dark World"" opens with Thors villainous brother Loki defeated and in chains; with Thors human girlfriend Jane (Natalie Portman) pining for her absent lover; and with Thor preoccupied with stamping out uprisings on various of the nine realms that he and his kind rule over. So far so good. But when Jane stumbles upon something called the Aether -- a long-hidden source of destructive energy which takes over her body like a virus -- Thor must drop everything and return to Earth in order to protect her from Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). The evil leader of the Dark Elves Malekith wants to use the Aether to -- well what exactly? Control the nine realms? Destroy them? Plunge them into darkness so he can harvest mushrooms? Whatever it is it isnt good. To be fair theres stuff to like in ""The Dark World."" Loki for example -- whom Thor must reluctantly team with in his fight against the Dark Elves -- is simply fabulous. Hiddleston steals the show here making wickedness and treachery look a heck of a lot more fun than virtue. Cinematically theres also a great scene in which a flotilla of Asgardian funeral barges are lit afire with flaming arrows as they approach a waterfall. Sure its probably entirely CGI but its gorgeous all the same especially in 3-D and surprisingly moving. In general though the action scenes are only okay. There is however one genuinely jaw-dropping bit of violence that startled me especially for a comic-book movie. Oh and lets not forget Odins facial hair. His white beard is magnificent particularly the mustache which wriggles down along the sides of his mouth in sinuous testimony to the skill of his Asgardian barber -- or the films makeup department which numbered 67 people. Odin may not be a god but he has divine whiskers. See? Thats the problem with ""The Dark World."" If Im spending that much time studying Odins grooming theres something wrong with the story which is kind of slow to get going and features too many undeveloped threads. Whats up with the jealousy for instance between the warrior Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and Jane? After Thor brings Jane to Asgard the two women shoot each other a couple of nasty looks. But otherwise the dynamic goes nowhere. Do something with it or drop it. Theres some humor too but far too little for my taste. This is especially disappointing after the first film which made much of the culture shock experienced by contemporary earthlings who encounter a dude who drops out of the sky looking and talking like a Rennfest staffer who takes his job a little too seriously. And thats the real flaw with ""The Dark World"" which seems to have inhaled a bit too much of its own noxious Aether. The only one who seems to have gotten the memo that the whole thing is a gas is the bad guy.   PG-13. At area theaters. Contains action violence. In English and some Elvish with subtitles. 112 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

That was in 2008 after Armstrong had announced he was ending a three-year retirement to return to professional cycling. The road map for the film seemed clear. It would follow the unexpected comeback while exploring the question of what was driving the man who had recovered from a near-fatal illness stonewalled ceaseless accusations of doping and against all odds--and logic--won the Tour de France seven times in a row. But the work in progress changed when early this year Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that he had been doping all along. The filmmaker retooled his film accordingly and retitled it ""The Armstrong Lie."" He might also have called it ""The Tooth Fairy"" since part of the fascination is why we ever believed the story the pedaler was peddling. Watch a clip from the documentary film ""The Armstrong Lie"" chronicling sports legend Lance Armstrongs improbable rise and ultimate fall from grace. (Photo/Video Sony Pictures Classics) Watching the final version of the documentary means seeing elements of the earlier version in a new light with the supposed hero as a peerless liar who insisted on his spotlessness even as professional cycling as a whole proved to be a dirty sport. Some of those elements will be familiar to those who have followed Armstrongs doubt-shadowed triumphs and shattering disgrace--the fury he unleashed against his perceived enemies (""He was an immensely intimidating person"" one interview subject recalls); the evolution of doping techniques from drugs to transfusions in order to avoid detection; the greedy hypocrisy of cycling officials; the long-standing code of silence among teammates and associates who finally turned on their teams leader. Still ""The Armstrong Lie"" is truly singular a tale of ambition thats almost mad enough to be mythic. ""The Armstrong Lie"" is a grimly fascinating tale of ambition thats almost mad enough to be mythic says WSJ Film Critic Joe Morgenstern. Photo Sony Pictures Classics. Lance Armstrong the movie notes came out of Plano Texas as an angry competitive kid ""I love beatin people"" the kid says putting it plainly if mildly. Yet the figurative beatings he inflicted were no greater than the punishments he endured almost two decades ago from testicular cancer that spread to his abdomen lungs and brain. Film clips from that time remind us of how Armstrongs illness his remarkable recovery and the philanthropic foundation he created all served to inoculate him against suspicions of doping that were already swirling around him. We believed or at least half-believed his protestations of purity because we didnt want to believe that someone whod been through such medical tortures would endanger his health yet again much less lie about it. And because as the film shows vividly his ambition to win--to punish to crush to prevail--transcended ordinary comprehension. Was he nothing more than a compulsive liar? Mr. Gibneys footage suggests otherwise. One of the most interesting parts of the film turns on the evident sincerity of Armstrongs postretirement attempt to win the 2009 Tour de France by riding clean. He failed though his third-place finish was as the filmmaker puts it ""the perfect ending for the film I wanted to make."" Related Lance and The Armstrong Lie In the film he did make his subject tells the truth only after the evidence against him has become so overwhelming as to make him a pariah in the sport he managed to dominate for 10 years. ""The Armstrong Lie"" wears thin before its over; the wafer-thin nature of the cyclists personality cant sustain a two-hour running time. Toward the end though theres a revelatory moment that requires close attention. Its in one of the clips from the Winfrey interview after Armstrong has confessed. ""Did you feel in any way that you were cheating?"" Oprah asks. He nods his head almost imperceptibly meaning yes and says ""No."" At least one of his reflexes is still sharp. Watch a clip from the film ""Thor The Dark World."" Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet. (Photo Marvel) Thor The Dark World Under a photo of Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman on the Facebook site for ""Thor The Dark World"" a fan has posted the comment ""Theyre so beautiful it hurts."" Well they really are beautiful these two--Mr. Hemsworths Thor the God of Thunder who goes after bad guys with his trusty hammer and Ms. Portmans Jane Thors across-the-universe girlfriend. In the previous episode Jane an astrophysicist was much concerned about resolving her particle data. In this one shes worried that ""physics is going to go ballistic the very walls of reality will be torn apart"" because the nine realms of the physical world are in convergence and a race of baddies called Dark Elves have a weapon called the Aether that can destroy every corner of creation including our own. Thats a problem to be sure but the larger problem transcending all realms is that this action-adventure sequel from Marvel soon turns so dumb and 3-D-murky that it hurts. ENLARGE Chris Hemsworth in Marvels Thor The Dark World Marvel Most of the action is generic though sufficiently straightforward to provide relief from the incoherent storytelling. Which realm are we in now? Where were we a moment ago and how did everyone get here? Such questions seem not to have troubled the writers or producers. As for the director Alan Taylor he has done a lot of top-drawer television including episodes of ""Game of Thrones"" but theres no sign he has a feel for feature films; his emphasis is entirely on big set pieces at the expense of narrative flow. Tom Hiddleston is entertaining once again as Loki Thors evil brother. Anthony Hopkins is orotund once again as Thors father King Odin. Idris Elba has returned as Heimdall the omnipotent sentry who for lack of much else to do gives new meaning to the notion of watchful waiting. And in a film thats often sillier than it wants to be Stellan Skarsgard is back with intentional silliness as the physicist Erik Selvig who turns up this time as a flasher at Stonehenge. Watch a clip from the film ""How I Live Now."" An American girl (Saoirse Ronan) sent to the English countryside finds herself fighting for her survival as the UK turns into a violent military state. (Photo/Video Magnolia Pictures) How I Live Now Kevin Macdonalds screen version of the young-adult novel by Meg Rosoff gets off on the wrong foot as soon as its teenage American heroine arrives at Heathrow and plants her own two feet and torn tights on English soil. Saoirse Ronans Daisy whos been sent by her father to stay with relatives in the countryside is a spoiled brat and an offputting pain who is tense obviously troubled and on some sort of medication. Then Europe gets off on a much wronger foot by engaging in a spasm of nuclear war after which Daisy and her cousins must struggle to survive in a sylvan setting suddenly showered with radioactive snow and beset by violence from unnamed and mostly unseen terrorists. ENLARGE Saoirse Ronan and George MacKay in How I Live Now Magnolia Pictures Ms. Ronan grows in screen presence and grace as her character opens up--the movies central notion is that Daisy will be healed by her grueling trials--and the story profits somewhat from its outward resemblance to the ""Hunger Games"" saga. Yet the production feels tentative and underpopulated I thought not only of Katniss Everdeen but of the marvelous pandemonium in Danny Boyles zombie epic ""28 Days Later."" Short on events and surprises ""How I Live Now"" concocts a mystical bond between Daisy and her handsome cousin Eddie (George MacKay) with whom she ambiguously but still provocatively falls in love. The things kids will do when the power grid fails. Watch a clip from the film ""The Motel Life."" A pair of working-class brothers flee their Reno Motel after getting involved in a fatal hit-and-run accident. Starring Emile Hirsch Stephen Dorff and Kris Kristofferson. (Photo/Video Polsky Films) The Motel Life Actor Stephen Dorff speaks with WSJs Alexandra Wolfe about his new film ""The Motel Life"" which opens in theaters Friday Nov. 8 and stars Emile Hirsch Dakota Fanning and Kris Kristofferson. Photo AP. No one will accuse the Polsky brothers Gabe and Alan of dressing up their directorial debut with the trappings of popular success. This tale of down-and-out brothers living on the edge in Nevada has all the crowd-pleasing potential of a dirge. (It was adapted by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster from a novel by the writer-musician Willy Vlautin.) All the same its admirable and even memorable in its moody fashion thanks to Roman Vasyanovs richly textured cinematography--hes a shooter to keep our eyes on--and three affecting performances. ENLARGE Stephen Dorff and Emile Hirsch in The Motel Life Polsky Films Frank and Jerry Lee Flannigan played respectively by Emile Hirsch and Stephen Dorff flee their seedy motel in Reno for a similar dump in Elko after Jerry Lee accidentally hits a kid on a bike and kills him. The brothers are hardly a fun couple but theyre full of buried talent--Frank is a born storyteller Jerry Lee covers motel walls with vibrant drawings--and their devotion to one another shapes the plot; indeed it pretty much is the plot. Dakota Fanning plays Annie a troubled young woman and Franks former girlfriend. Whenever she smiles a world thats woefully wrong seems briefly right. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE The Triplets of Belleville (2003) The Tour de France in the 1960s rendered by Sylvain Chomet in an animated feature with a visual language all its own. The absence of conventional dialogue helps draw us into the mysteriously moving world of a spoke-thin bicycle-racer; his indomitable club-footed grandmother their supersniffer of a family dog and the three old crones of the title superannuated vaudevillians who turn up when the action moves from bicycle racing in France to bicyclist-chasing in Belleville a city thats an amalgam of New York Montreal the Mont Saint Michel and the metropolis from ""Metropolis."" ENLARGE Good Will Hunting (1997) Stellan Skarsgard is Gerald Lambeau an MIT math professor who first spots the towering talent of Will Hunting the angry young blue-collar hero played by Matt Damon. Will has mayhem on his mind and a brain that resonates with the deepest mysteries of mathematics. When asked how hes able to prove theorems that have stumped the worlds intellectual elite this semitough kid from South Boston compares himself matter of factly to Mozart. Mr. Damon wrote the script with his friend and co-star Ben Affleck. Robin Williams is Wills therapist. The director was Gus Van Sant. ENLARGE Atonement (2007) Saoirse Ronans Briony a precocious 13-year-old in 1930s England jumps to a conclusion that isnt just wrong but perverse in this screen version of Ian McEwans novel which Joe Wright directed from an adaptation by Christopher Hampton. Briony lacks any understanding of adult behavior that might put what she thinks shes seen in sensible context.

Jay Maidment/Marvel hide caption toggle caption Jay Maidment/Marvel Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his hammer are back for a supernatural sequel battling the forces of evil again -- this time without his fellow Avengers. Jay Maidment/Marvel Thor The Dark World Director Alan Taylor Genre Action adventure Running Time 120 minutes Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence and some suggestive content. With Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Tom Hiddleston Christopher Eccleston Anthony Hopkins Audiences for Thor The Dark World may initially be confused as to whether they accidentally wandered into a preview screening of the next installment in the Hobbit series. The opening prologue -- a solemn Anthony Hopkins narrates an epic tale of ancient wars between the forces of good and a race of evil elves -- feels like pure Tolkien and with good reason the Norse mythologies that inspired the Lord of the Rings author also informed Marvel Comics Stan Lee and Larry Lieber as they went about developing their godlike superhero. And lets face it The fantasy elements of the Thor (Chris Hemsworth) backstory are always slightly at odds with the sci-fi that drives the rest of Marvels cinematic universe. The rest of the Avengers team are all humans with either heightened natural abilities or science-initiated mutations; Thors status as a godlike otherworldly alien blends cosmic science with plain old magical mysticism. In The Dark World director Alan Taylor fully embraces those fantasy elements deftly deploying them to abrade against the earthbound segments and playing up the incongruities for comic relief. i This time its scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) playing stranger in a strange land when Thor takes her to his otherworldly home in Asgard. Jay Maidment/Marvel hide caption toggle caption Jay Maidment/Marvel This time its scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) playing stranger in a strange land when Thor takes her to his otherworldly home in Asgard. Jay Maidment/Marvel Taylor knows this territory well His directors chair was most recently parked on the set of HBOs Game of Thrones and he brings the epic sweep of that fantasy series to the otherworldly parts of this film only with a much bigger budget for painting on a much larger digital canvas. His digital artists deserve serious credit too; this Thor contains some of the most gorgeously rendered images in the Avengers films from the grandeur of Thors home in Asgard (a glittering starlit funeral over Asgardian waterfalls somber and beautiful) to the bleak and storm-swept landscapes of Svartalfheim home to a race of Dark Elves who have returned after thousands of years in exile. Those elves led by Malekith (a nearly unrecognizable Christopher Eccleston) mean to renew their quest to destroy the nine realms that Thor is sworn to protect -- our Earth is one -- by way of a once-every-5000-years alignment of the worlds and a mystical energy source known as the Aether to get there. Only it just so happens that due to an accidental side-effect of the coming cosmic convergence the Aether has taken residence in the body of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) astrophysicist and Thors would-be girlfriend. The lack of chemistry between Hemsworth and Portman plain enough in the first Thor movie is still a problem here but at least theyve largely ditched the starry-eyed schoolgirl routine. Portman is still playing damsel in distress to some extent in Fosters interactions with her big hero but their romance takes a backseat to the bigger issues in play. The more important -- and more effective -- interactions are between Thor and his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the latter imprisoned in Asgards dungeons since his attempt to enslave the Earth in The Avengers. Hiddleston remains the single greatest asset at Marvels disposal a complicated baddie played by a fine actor with a blend of wounded malice and impish glee. The other secret weapon here is Avengers writer-director Joss Whedon who was brought in for some uncredited script rewrites. Movies in the Avengers universe have succeeded largely on their willingness to blend light humor into the battle between good and evil and nowhere is that more essential than in Thors entries in the series; the overblown grandeur of his world threatens to bog things down with self-seriousness. And so the sequences on Earth -- they take place in London surely a calculated attempt to further cement the international popularity of these films -- boast a typically Whedonesque snap particularly a deliciously awkward date that Foster goes on at the movies start. The film probably could have used a little more of that sort of thing along with more of the mildly goofy antics of Fosters scientific team (Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings) to ground the fantasy further. And perhaps a little too much of the film happens beyond Earth amid fantastical realms and Norse-ish names which threatens to distance audiences and diminish the stakes. But once that every-few-eons convergence happens separations between the worlds dont matter so much anymore. Dimensions collide and Taylor allows the film to hurtle with the force of Thors hammer into pure popcorn-spectacle territory. And thats one realm that The Dark World exists in quite comfortably.

November 7 2013 -- 414pm Marvel/Disney Chris Hemsworth in ""Thor The Dark World."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Any reservations I had about ""Thor The Dark World"" evaporated when the movie shifted into maximum overdrive in its second hour. The latest chapter in Marvels never-ending story takes a while to find its narrative momentum but its later better scenes have a loony oomph that drowns out your misgivings. It elevates comic-book pandemonium to new heights of clamor. Joyous Pop Art excess permeates every frame. Directing duties have passed from Kenneth Branagh to Alan Taylor late of HBOs medieval-mystical ""Game of Thrones."" The sequel builds on the alchemy of apocalyptic tomfoolery and humor in the original (and ""The Avengers""). First its knocking your block off in battle scenes then youre laughing your head off. Its only in the moments when the latest threat to the cosmos is plotting his attacks that the energy flags. The movie demonstrates that even without a compelling villain you can have a jam-packed whirligig of a superhero movie. Theres a lot going on here with Asgard under attack in an intergalactic conflict spreading among nine dimensions. The expected third-act punchouts send adversaries blipping out of London (where the earthbound action is centered) into bizarre alternate realms and back again. There is a meatier exploration of Thors troubled connections with his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and physicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). They break into frequent mid-battle quips hashing out their various relationship issues. ""Its not that I dont enjoy our little chats"" the devilishly snide Loki tells imperious Odin. ""Its just that ... I dont."" As Thor golden-locked Chris Hemsworth wears a cape with more casual authority than any actor in the game. Maybe its the breadth of those gym-pumped shoulders or maybe the blunt self-confidence thats part of his Australian heritage. Whatever the cause hes utterly at home as the demigod prince with a special fondness for human beings. Set between the icy high theatricality of Hopkins Odin and the marrow-poisoning malice of Hiddlestons Loki Hemsworths Thor radiates a reassuring warmth. Hes a deity you could have a beer with. The opening scenes are the most labored with Hopkins declaiming the back story of the nefarious vampire-like light-shunners who want to return the universe to its original darkness. The leader of these Dark Elves is Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) whose Nosferatu-inspired makeup provides most of his paper-thin characterization. His doomsday weapon is the Aether an all-powerful concoction of dark energy. Odin expects Thor to defend their stunningly visualized kingdom impatient that his thoughts are still with Earth and Jane. Earth is funnier than Asgard. Janes coping with Thors two-year absence by half-heartedly dog-paddling in the dating pool (her awkward lunch date with a well-known comic actor is a stitch). Portman is that rare actress who can make fun of who shes playing and still make you care about her. Janes snarky intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) is now lording it over her own sub-intern whose name she cant be bothered to remember. Janes scientific mentor Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) suffering manic PTSD following last years cataclysmic ""Avengers"" battle for New York delivers a graduate seminar in Monty Python lunacy. The London scenes are brimful of sight gags and silly asides no doubt thanks to the script polish by Joss Whedon. Who said Marvel movies have to star Robert Downey Jr. to be uproarious? THOR THE DARK WORLD  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence and some suggestive content. This is Thors third outing in as many years and remarkably it doesnt seem like more of the same. The films design feels more like an occult war epic than a superhero saga. Theres epic property damage but the buildings that go kablooey arent the usual tourist magnets and the destruction is thankfully free from collateral human casualties. Theres also a focus on strategy as Thor recruits the untrustworthy Loki in his battle against Malekith. Will the master trickster use his wiles against their common enemy or is he more interested in conquering his resented older brother? The film keeps you guessing until literally the final frames which deliver the best ending of any comic-book adaptation. In a film awash with ""Wow"" moments they saved the biggest blast for last.

"Thor hammers home the jokes The Dark World review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThor hammers home the jokes The Dark World reviewAbundant laughter saves Thor The Dark World from thudding like the Thunder Gods hammer. Tom Hiddleston left and Chris Hemsworth are clearly having a super-manly superhero type discussion in Thor The Dark World.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 7 2013Thor The Dark WorldStarring Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Tom Hiddleston Christopher Eccleston Kat Dennings Idris Elba Rene Russo and Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Alan Taylor. Opens Nov. 8. See Star listings for theatres and show times. 112 minutes. PG""At least pretend to enjoy yourself"" concerned father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) commands uber-serious son Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in Thor The Dark World.Sage advice if not very Norse or godly and it also applies to viewers of this messy Marvel superhero sequel. Abundant laughter saves the picture from thudding like the Thunder Gods hammer. Article Continued BelowWhen we last left our long-tressed champ he was busily proving his worth to his eye-patched papa and winsome mama (Rene Russo) engaging in sibling rivalry with his jealous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and frustrating his Earthling lover Jane (Natalie Portman) a sexy but needy astrophysicist.Thor wants love but he needs to save the universe or rather the Norse Nine Realms which includes adopted home Earth and his heavenly crib Asgard a gaudy place resembling a giant church pipe organ. Round Two ups the stakes although theyve been enlarged into incoherence by a committee-written script sludgy CGI and flatlined 3D. The main bad guys are the surly Dark Elves led by withered cocoon dweller Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). They all reside in the hellhole Svartalfheim a name that could win you triple Scrabble points but its a good basement in which to get hammered.The elves are bummed because their eternal dark was invaded by light which has to be the weirdest grievance ever for anything other than a mushroom. Theyve been biding their time for eons waiting for a Nine Realms alignment called the Convergence where they can cause mischief. They have access to an all-powerful red mojo called the Aether which -- wouldnt you just know it? -- gets loose and troublesome.Got all that? Doesnt matter if you do because what saves The Dark World isnt the blows-up-good plot but a wicked sense of fun a series trait director Alan Taylor wisely continues from Kenneth Branaghs original film.Taylor and Hemsworth both know that Thor is the goofiest of all Marvel superheroes so they play him for laughs while keeping the film just this side of parody. That leather strap on the bottom of Thors hammer? Its just the thing for hanging it on a coat hook in Janes London apartment.We also get more of delightfully bad Loki this time with more sass and less smarm. He and Thor comically combine forces clumsily confiscating an enemy jet that looks like a giant safety razor (Gillette really missed a product placement opportunity). Even gods need flying lessons.Odins ""enjoy yourself"" decree proves infectious. Kat Dennings again summons a Miley Cyrus vibe as Janes cheeky intern showing up this time with her own intern in tow. And Stellan Skarsgards brainy scientist Erik Selvig gamely goes in for a script absurdity that has him running naked through Stonehenge.Alan Taylor is best known as a TV director for such shows as Game of Thrones Mad Men and The Sopranos. But he started as a filmmaker and his 1995 first feature Palookaville starred Vincent Gallo Adam Trese and William Forsythe as hapless thieves who think theyre breaking into a jewelry store but end up in a bakery instead. So they make the best of it and just steal doughnuts. A lot of that kind of loopy spirit can be found in The Dark World. And speaking of loopy stick around for not one but two end-credit codas one of which really should have been the movies proper ending.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The hammer-swinging superhero must stop an ancient villain from obliterating the universe. Rated PG-13 (action brief gruesome imagery) BOTTOM LINE Moldering dialogue and intergalactic nonsense add up to what feels like an interminable session of Dungeons amp; Dragons. Thor cant hammer his way out of this one. CAST Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Tom Hiddleston LENGTH 152 Of all the superheroes in the current Marvel universe the funniest is Thor. A Norse god armed with a Viking helmet a stone hammer and the pectorals of a Eurasian elk hes the walking embodiment of Wagners ""Ring"" cycle remixed with Led Zeppelins ""Kashmir."" Transporting this long-haired brute into our sleek new millennium has great potential for comedy -- but Disney-Marvel seems to have other ideas. ""Thor"" is turning out to be their least amusing franchise. The first film 2011s ""Thor"" had glimmers of wit Chris Hemsworth in the title role donned dirty denim and a flannel shirt to become a kind of Soundgarden superhero while director Kenneth Branagh tried to keep the overall tone breezy (with mixed success). The sequel however barely cracks a smile. ""Thor The Dark World"" unfortunately makes good on its portentous title. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The returning cast members still seem willing to horse around but several Marvel screenwriters and new director Alan Taylor (of HBOs ""Game of Thrones"") quickly beat the fun out of them. This ""Thor"" is a giant rock pile of backstory and exposition told in flowery Tolkien-esque language about the alien Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who wants to destroy the universe. He plans to unleash the Aether a mercurial substance of untold evil during a rare planetary convergence. Its about as dull as it sounds and ""Thor"" compounds the problem by explaining the details at length. Thor argues about strategy with his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins orating in King Lear mode) then joins forces with his devious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston again stealing what show there is). That leaves little time for Thors would-be girlfriend scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) who mostly stands around looking pained. Kat Dennings and Chris ODowd contribute a bit of modern-day snark and Stellan Skarsgard is the suddenly loony physicist Erik Selvig a comic-relief role that ill suits the great actor. The tiresome climax -- a race to close a wormhole which Thor just did in last years ""The Avengers"" -- is unforgivable especially after such a long slog through so much interplanetary nonsense. The movie ends with an unfunny setup for a sequel which makes Thors next world look even darker. 145 MoviesThor The Dark World trailer PLOT The hammer-swinging superhero must stop an ancient villain from obliterating the universe. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (action brief gruesome imagery) CAST Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Tom Hiddleston LENGTH 152 BOTTOM LINE Moldering dialogue and intergalactic nonsense add up to what feels like an interminable session of Dungeons amp; Dragons. Thor cant hammer his way out of this one. ----- Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff CHRIS HEMSWORTH HAMMERS OUT LEADING MAN ROLES Although its been only two years since he first picked up Thors hammer Chris Hemsworth who once again plays the god of thunder in ""Thor The Dark World"" opening today has become a sought-after leading man working with directors including Ron Howard (the racing biopic ""Rush"" which came out in September and the upcoming whaling epic ""Heart of the Sea"") and Michael Mann (the computer-hacking drama ""Cyber"" due out next year). The actor said that pursuing dramatic roles in other projects has helped him find renewed energy to bring to his Marvel alter ego a character he could potentially reprise in a third ""Thor"" movie and two ""Avengers"" sequels. That energy and renewed commitment certainly appeared to be useful as Hemsworth sporting a faux wound on his temple picked up his hammer and prepared to head back to set. ""I started my career on TV -- I was on one show in particular for three years -- so I know what its like to just exhaust a story or a character"" he said. ""I wouldnt want that to happen with this.

Grade B ""Thor The Dark World"" marries American and Scandinavian traditions in its own daft way. Its like a smorgasbord designed to give fans all they can eat - or a roadside 24-hour buffet that clocks in blessedly at a mere two hours. Its welcoming air and variety cant fully disguise its lack of top-notch ingredients. The piece dresistance (and also the raison detre) is the battle between the hammer-wielding prince of thunder Thor (Chris Hemsworth) the heir apparent to the magical space kingdom of Asgard and Malekith (Chris Eccleston) the leader of the loathsome light-denying Dark Elves. Theyre fighting for possession of an all-powerful destructive force known as the Aether. The Aether is as red as the Scarlet Letter ""A."" (I suppose calling it just plain ""ether"" wouldnt seem grand enough.) Malekith wants it to restore perfect blackness to the Nine Realms - in other words to reinstate the darkness that covered everything before The Big Bang. He and his men are not called the Dark Elves for nothing. The Nine Realms of the cosmos are about to converge - thats how Thors astrophysicist earthling girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) enters the picture. While investigating mysteries related to the alignment - including a London industrial park where thrown objects disappear before they hit the ground then re-appear in mid-air - she falls through an astral vortex and lands near the burial place of the Aether which was hidden by Thors grandfather after he defeated the Dark Elves. The crimson gunk invades Janes comely person. Some funny things happen on the way to the Thor-Malekith showdown the best of them after Thor takes Jane to Asgard for anti-Aether treatments. She cant resist talking trash to Thors dad even if the patriarch is a godly one-eyed king whose full name is Odin Allfather (Anthony Hopkins). Shes astonished to meet Thors stepmother Frigga (Rene Russo). So is the audience since she barely registered in ""Thor"" (2011). Despite the most unbecoming hairdo since Princess Leia Frigga - thankfully pronounced Free-ga - turns out be a sprightly resourceful gal in the brief time we get to know her. Hemsworth wisely applies his brawny imprint with a feathery-light touch. Hes not merely a gentle giant hes also quite genial. Awed reactions amuse him. For Thor annihilating a rock monster by tossing a hammer that returns like a boomerang is all in a days work. But its not a good sign when the audience cheers less for Thor than for his slippery adoptive brother the shape-shifter Loki played with virtuoso attitude by Tom Hiddleston. Odin has locked Loki in a deluxe dungeon for crimes against Asgard and humanity. He still assumes crowd-pleasing subversive postures and mischievously activates everyones distrust - especially after Thor decides he needs him to quell the Dark Elves. Like artist Jack Kirby and writer Stan Lee in the early Thor comic books director Alan Taylor and his team give Asgard a heavy-metal ambiance thats simultaneously antique and futuristic. (Lee makes his usual comic cameo.) And they always try to bring some fun into the action even if its silly like Janes intern (Kat Dennings) and her intern smooching as the Dark Elves bear down on them or Janes colleague Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) contending that he works better without pants. (He wears tightie-whities.) But the film simply doesnt follow through on its attempt to imbue contemporary sci-fi/fantasy with the humorous elan of Errol Flynns great swashbucklers. Its promising to see jovial introductions of Thors Warriors Three - Hogun the Grim Fandral the Dashing and Volstagg the Voluminous. But did anyone consider hiring Tom Stoppard or Robert Towne to provide some juicy lines or some unforgettable set pieces? Volstagg is defined strictly by his girth just as Hogun is by his determined look and Fandral by his resemblance to well Errol Flynn. Idris Elba comes off better as Asgards guardian Heimdall. He tops Hemsworth in stoic humor and gets one memorable piece of action - slicing through an aliens stealth spacecraft and gliding down it on his sword the way Douglas Fairbanks slid down a sail on his dagger in ""The Black Pirate."" Little else is inspired in ""Thor The Dark World."" Heimdalls command post faintly recalls but does not match the swirling decor of Mike Hodges cult film ""Flash Gordon."" The climactic action staged in London and throughout the Nine Realms plays homage to the best comic-book film of them all Richard Lesters ""Superman II"" without ever equaling it. In the middle of the final conflagration Thor takes the Underground to Greenwich; when a proper blonde bumps against his chest she briefly caresses his manly breast. Yes its funny to see Thor exciting a strap-hanger in a subway. But why isnt similar humor wrung from the impact of Janes balletic body on all those beefy Asgardians? Like I said no follow-through. The movie washes over you in an amiable blur. Even when the fate of the cosmos hangs in the balance not much is at stake. In ""Thor The Dark World"" royal families are torn asunder and the universe could revert to a dark void. But it all goes by in a wink and a muscle-bound shrug.

Updated July 30 2016  153 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Thor Thor sequel hammers us into submission By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Nov 7 2013 (...) Compared to other Marvel characters Thor is a difficult sell. Although his name and accessories allude to Scandinavian myth the comic-book back-story is literally out of this world sent to earth from a planet called Asgard. The hammer-swinging superhero doesnt have human frailties like Spider-Man a snarky sense of humor like Iron Man or guilty-pleasure rage like the Hulk. Hes almost too perfect and in Thors recent movie incarnations beefy blonde Chris Hemsworth is about as warm as a fjord.Marvel headquarters seems to have taken note of these issues because the sequel ""Thor The Dark World"" spreads enough of the love to co-stars set designers and special effects personnel to make us forget that the hero is just a glorified quarterback from somebody elses favorite team.Of course we still have to suffer through the usual yadda-yadda about a dark lord unleashing the power of evil. We learn that an an Asgardian super-villain named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) is trying to uncork a force called the Aether and seize the throne from Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Pragmatically siding with the bad guys is Odins adopted son Loki (Tom Hiddleston the very definition of a scene stealer) who is smirking in prison after trying to defeat his brother Thor in ""The Avengers."" Malekith has buried his stash of the Aether under London where its unearthed by astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her wisecracking sidekick Darcy (Kat Dennings another delight). When Jane becomes woozy from a whiff of the poison Thor arrives like a prodigal boyfriend and rockets his ex to Asgard.Serving chicken soup for the superhero soul is Thors mother (Rene Russo). Shes at the center of some unusually emotional moments before the whole shebang devolves into warfare. Loki pledges his conditional loyalty to Thor and they lead the Aryan er Asgardian army into battle against creatures who seem like horned Orcs from a forgotten Tolkien story. Indeed all of Asgard bears a suspicious if impressive resemblance to Middle-earth. For the mandatory leveling of an iconic city the scene shifts to London or rather to nearby Greenwich where Janes mentor Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) is warning the world about impending doom. But these things never end. For the inevitable Thor Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D. sequels the Marvel marketing machine has a reasonably bright North Star to guide it.What ""Thor The Dark World""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 152  Content Intense sci-fi action and violence Joe Williams (joethecritic) is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Loki hisses back ""Trust my rage."" Poor Thor. Sure hes handsome and strong and has a day of the week named after him (like his father Odin). But as dreamed up in 1962 by Stan Lee his brother Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby Thor is one Marvel comic-book hero without any redeeming quirks. He has no wiseass wit like Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark or anger-management issues like Dr. Bruce ""Incredible Hulk"" Banner. Embodied by Chris Hemsworth in three Marvel movies -- the 2011 Thor the 2012 The Avengers and now Thor The Dark World -- he is your basic uncomplicated warrior your holy grunt fighting to defend his home realm of Asgard between side trips to Earth to woo astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). (MORE Richard Corlisss Review of Thor) But the god of thunder shrivels in character complexity beside Loki the god of mischief later promoted to the more imposing and accurate rank god of evil. The Marvel Encyclopedia instructs us that Loki stands 6 ft. 4 in. and weighs 525 lb. (to Thors 6-ft. 6-in. 640-lb. frame) but Tom Hiddleston incarnates him as a sinister sylph draped in black leather and chain mail a Hamlet among hunks. Their brawn often seems puny in comparison with his scheming brain. Lokis demeanor bears a hint of the gay outsider an antidote to the solemn testosterone of most of the Avengers crew. Except for Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark he is one of the few figures in the cosmology who looks to be enjoying himself. Without camping things up Loki shows that its good to be bad. Though Marvel execs dont give bad guys their own movie franchises Loki has dominated three big films in the canon the two Thors and The Avengers in which the entire superhero sextet was summoned to bring him down. The Dark World continues the story line of those earlier films and bursts into life only when the villain is swanning his way to Doomsday. (MORE Why The Avengers Was Almost Super) Odin (Anthony Hopkins) has dispatched Thor and his Asgardian elite to make peace -- i.e. win war -- in the Nine Realms. Meanwhile the Dark Elves who existed before time began have unleashed a powerful force called the Aether; its like the Tesseract the MacGuffin from The Avengers times a quillion. Some of the Aether gets to Earth and infects Jane. Thor transports her to Asgards pipe-organ castle where his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) cares for her. But the Norse gods finest doctors cannot extract the fearful substance from Janes system. Shes the universes prettiest time bomb. All in Asgard are awaiting a monumental moment in the Nine Realms history. As Thor explains ""Every 500 years the worlds align perfectly and that we call the Convergence."" If youre wondering what significant events occurred five centuries ago in 1513 Ponce de Leon discovered Florida; Balboa became the first European to lay eyes on the Pacific Ocean; and Machiavelli the Loki of his day wrote The Prince. (MORE See a Review of Ross Kings Machiavelli Biography by Subscribing to TIME) So wheres our bad boy? Hes been imprisoned on Asgard until Thor enlists him to do battle against the Dark Elves Lord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). In confinement Loki smolders but does not pout and manages to spread a little murk among his adoptive kin. He also has the occasional patch of dialogue that serves to prod viewers who may have lost their way in the thickets of Marvel mythology. Whereas Thor is handed starchy declarations like ""I will find a way to save us all"" Loki gets to whisper to an old adversary ""All I ever wanted was you -- dead at my feet."" And stab Hamlet couldnt have said it better. Since Marvel movie series rarely dispense with characters from earlier films The Dark World must make room for dozens of denizens of heaven and earth. Thors warrior retinue of Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) Fandral (Zachary Levi) and the Valhalla hottie Sif (Jaimie Alexander) are back. So is Heimdall the Watchman played by Idris Elba with a good deal more panache than he was allowed to infuse into his starring role this year as Nelson Mandela. (MORE TIMEs Toronto Film Festival Review of Mandela) In London Jane is hooked up with a blind date (Chris ODowd in an eye-blink role) and her sexy-mousy intern Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) gets her own intern (Jonathan Howard). Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) discovered wandering mad hysterical and naked through Stonehenge is locked in an asylum where he uses shoes as pointers to give a lecture on the Convergence. ""Any questions?"" he asks his fellow inmates. ""Yeah"" says Stan Lee now 90 in his mandatory cameo. ""Can I have my shoe back?"" (MORE James Poniewozik on Stan Lee and the Marvel Superheroes) Packing this bulging dramatis personae into a two-hour movie must have been a no-fun chore for its chief assemblers Alan Taylor who has directed multiple episodes of smart TV series (The Sopranos Deadwood Mad Men Rome and very much in the Thor spirit Game of Thrones) and screenplay writers Christopher Yost Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. They are like the adult supervisors at an overcrowded kids birthday party required to find parts for every child in some enormous role-playing game. The clutter makes your head feel like its about to explode -- and not in a good way with wonders upon wonders. Instead it seems like arcana that might show up on the midterm final the next Marvel movie. So its a relief when the god of evil mischief returns to earth to blow stuff up including a New Mexico town in Thor Grand Central Terminal in The Avengers and this time Christopher Wrens stately Royal Naval College in Greenwich England. Is this the end of little Loki? We wont say but do stay seated through the long closing credits which plant more surprises than the rest of The Dark World put together. There you will find an Oscar-winning actor murmuring ""One down. Five to go."" That could refer to a nest of Infinity Stones or to the quintet and more of Marvel sagas. We hope theyll be enlivened by that maleficent spirit the genius Loki. Long may he rage.

"Thor The Dark World 3 stars Article Things to do >> Movies >> Article Thor The Dark World 3 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED VIDEO ""Thor The Dark World"" trailer By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Nov 7 2013 328 PM Thor is an interesting superhero and all but really people we need a Loki movie. Theres nothing in ""Thor The Dark World"" that wasnt done better in ""Thor"" or a lot better in ""The Avengers."" Except Tom Hiddlestons performance as Loki Thors evil adopted brother. Hiddleston continues to be the best thing about these films his sneering confidence curdling into condescension. The universe and all its realms simply arent big enough for his ego. He knows it we know it the filmmakers know it and ""Thor The Dark World"" is never more alive than when Loki is on-screen. Unfortunately thats not often enough. This time around a race of evil elves previously thought vanquished want to wipe out the universe as we know it and return it to the dark world -- note the title -- they evidently inhabited before time began or some such. There is a lot of ""or some such"" in this movie which doesnt always make a lot of sense. Which is fine because for all the talk of science its not a physics class. For which we can all be thankful. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has spent the past couple of years cleaning up messes in the nine realms and checking in on his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins who honestly doesnt seem like hes trying very hard) on Asgard the realm they call home. Meanwhile on Earth Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) seems to have forsaken her calling as a brilliant scientist to wait by the phone as it were for Thor to return. (He said he would.) Kat Dannings is back as Janes intern who now has an intern of her own; theyre all equal parts annoying and entertaining. And Stellan Skarsgard returns as the loopy scientist Erik Selvig who seems to have an aversion to pants. Somehow Jane unearths the Aether the ultimate weapon of the elves and it inhabits her. This awakens the head of the evil elves Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who wants to use the Aether to take advantage of the convergence of the realms which will leave them at their most defenseless and then he can ... honestly cant we get Loki in here somewhere? Eventually. Having killed all those people in New York in ""The Avengers"" (an event referred to here simply as ""New York"" as it was in ""Iron Man 3"") Loki is naturally in dutch with Odin. He imprisons his son and shackles much of the movies energy at the same time. Luckily events conspire to force his release and things pick up considerably thereafter. Its not that Hemsworth isnt good as Thor. He is particularly when hes trying to figure out the way Earth works on his visits to the planet. But he is also a pretty generic good guy -- in love with Jane sworn to protect Asgard and unless hes getting a chuckle from hanging his hammer on a coat rack not much else. Its easy to overlook the character and the actor. Jane is window dressing with a big vocabulary nothing more. Malekith is easily the least-interesting villain in any of these movies an angry little man with pointy ears and a bad attitude. Ah but Hiddleston. If someone somewhere isnt dreaming up a buddy movie starring him and Benedict Cumberbatch well they need to be. Hemsworth suggests fun in his performance as Thor. Hiddleston has fun as Loki -- big difference. And ""Thor The Dark World"" is a lot better than it would have been if he hadnt. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In the two years that have passed since he was banished to the desert of New Mexico and the year-and-change since he helped defend Manhattan from space invaders Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has grown from a cocky impulsive warrior prince to a man worthy of the trusty hammer he carries into battle. Thats great news for Asgard the magical space kingdom from which he hails but less-than-great news for Thor The Dark World the second solo outing for this blond-locked muscle-ripped deity. Pigheaded arrogance on full display in the first Thor film and last summers crossover bonanza The Avengers is one of the qualities that gave Hemsworths hero a spark of real personality. Without it he seems faintly duller--more square-jawed and noble a superman as pious as he is formidable. Theres nothing like maturity to ruin a good rogue. Like its predecessor The Dark World leaps back and forth between Earth and Asgard though the fish-out-of-water comedy that enlivened the original has gone missing. Actually thats not entirely true This time its love interest Jane (Natalie Portman) whos humorously out of her element but seeing her nervously meet the parents (Anthony Hopkins and Rene Russo) is less amusing than watching the Thunder God try to buy a horse at a pet store. How does a human end up walking the golden halls of Asgard? The answer involves vengeful elves gravitational anomalies inter-dimensional portals and a vague gaseous MacGuffin called the Aether. Most of these elements are introduced during another Hopkins-narrated prologue this one skewing even closer to Lord Of The Rings territory. When not barking mythological exposition at one another the characters are breathlessly exchanging pseudo-science that would make the late Gene Roddenberry proud. But every step the series takes isnt a backward one. In fact as is the case with most good superhero sequels The Dark World escapes the oppressive duty of franchise building finally getting to play in the world its origin-story predecessor established. Replacing Kenneth Branagh in the directors chair TV-trained Alan Taylor (Game Of Thrones) adapts more gracefully to the Marvel house style; for once the action is cleanly and coherently staged and Taylor brings some of the gravity and grandeur of Westeros to this universe. (Without instituting a redesign hes somehow made Asgard seem less Emerald City-chintzy.) Filling in the cracks of the perfunctory narrative is a wealth of Whedonesque comedy delivered by Thors returning Earthbound cavalry not just Jane still flustered by her beefcake suitor but also a quip-firing Darcy (Kat Dennings) and a ranting pantsless Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). This being a Marvel movie theres also a surprise cameo this time by a character who doesnt actually appear in the film. Confused? Just wait for it. But would it kill the makers of these splash-panel blockbusters to dream up a bad guy with a little menace a little flavor? As if to match Thors increasingly flawless virtue the heavy here is a bland force of ancient evil determined to destroy the universe because... well thats what forces of ancient evil try to do. Consequently the movies most valuable asset may be Tom Hiddleston reprising the role of Thors jealous treacherous brother Loki. Hes the only person onscreen with truly complicated motives and Hiddleston reveals new depths to the character once The Dark World in its most fruitful development forces this black sheep into an uneasy alliance with the favorite son. Forget the fairy-tale romance between Jane and her hammer-wielding hunk. The real emotional center of the Thor series is this sibling rivalry more compelling than any climactic battle royale or winking teaser for the next chapter.

The story gives a nod to Norse mythology but it should have focused less on the brawny god Thor and more on his cunning brother Loki the god of mischief.The perfunctory story picks up after the conclusion of 2012s The Avengers. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is faced with thunderous tasks Keep the cosmos in working order and fend off an evil race known as the Dark Elves. Theyre led by the malevolent Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who seeks to plunge the inter-galactic universe into darkness and despair. This entails a killer substance that sounds like ether but is actually spelled Aether. (We learn this through subtitles since the nasty elves speak their own brand of non-Tolkien Elvish). Unleashing the Aether will bring about annihilation across all realms. Portals are involved. But arent they always in space fantasy adventures?VIDEO Thor star Tom Hiddleston has some godlike movesSTORY No fantasy is too far-fetched for Thors Dark WorldMORE The cult of Loki everyones favorite trickster godREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersAs Odin Thors godly father and ruler of Asgard Anthony Hopkins looks as though hed rather be home watching Breaking Bad. Odin wants to declare battle against Malekith and his dark minions who are actually quite pasty-faced. But Thor prefers his one-man army maneuvers which involve big bangs from his trusty silver hammer.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) attempt to escape Asgard in a damaged Dark Elf vessel while being pursued by enemy ships. Almost as precious to him as his magical mallet is mortal scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The feeling presumably is mutual but you could never tell it by looking at Portmans face which remains as stony as Thors powerful weapon. Perhaps thats why Thor likes her so much. She reminds him of his beloved mallet.Her assistant Darcy (Kat Dennings) is livelier but has far less screen time. Such is also the case for Tom Hiddleston as Loki a charmingly campy villain. Loki Darcy and Janes would-be suitor Richard (Chris ODowd) have the lions share of funny lines -- which is not to imply that humor is at all abundant here.Loki spends most of his screen time caged up in a dungeon for his misdeeds. Sequestering him may be the proper retribution for his wrongdoings but its a tactical error in this story lessening the fun. He still gets off some snarling quips but theyre not enough to save this vapid film.While some visual effects are flashy and the production design is gleaming and intricate (if unworthy of 3-D) the overall movie is a convoluted bore. It livens up somewhat when Thor descends to Earth -- specifically London. He even boards the Tube superhero cape and all.While the first Thor had a fish-out-of-water charm this follow-up seems too influenced by The Lord of the Rings Star Wars and Game of Thrones (episodes of which director Alan Taylor also has helmed).Speaking of blockbusters the film has a few Easter egg surprises to satisfy fans of the Marvel universe.Mostly however this flavorless formulaic forgettable spectacle feels like a place-holder in the Avengers franchise. 245 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 22 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1hlmLcPHoliday Movies Calendar NovemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this November complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

The first ""Thor"" film directed by theater titan Kenneth Branagh gave the story not only some clever fish-out-of-water humor but a Shakespearean gravitas. The Norsemans second appearance in ""The Avengers"" had all the pop-cultural wit Joss Whedon could provide. But now its hammer time again with ""Thor The Dark World"" directed by Alan Taylor (and with a story and screenplay credited to five other people). And its OK. But if youve got a big blond hunk flying around and all you can manage is ""OK"" -- well I guess its hard to bring your A game when all youve got is the B team. The film has two notable mistakes one right at the beginning and the other threaded throughout. The first problem is one of those exposition-loaded prologues that fantasy and sci-fi films have grown way too fond of lately extended setting-the-stage sequences that keep the leads off screen eat up time and tell us things we dont need to know that happened a long time ago. These set-ups have an obvious appeal to ambitious filmmakers (who think they help create ""a mythology"") and greedy studios (who see them as a source of prequels and videogames). But they take information that could be conveyed in a line of dialogue and drag it out endlessly. The second mistake here is a decision to bring technology into this having Thor and his fellow Asgardians face an ancient army that nonetheless flies around in rocketships -- and having both sides lob grenades at each other shoot off what look like laser rifles and fire anti-aircraft guns. Im no mad Marvel purist (and the films have already taken lots of liberties with the comics) but for me the real appeal of good ol Thor is that hes not waving modern weapons around; hes got his sledge his buddies have their broadswords and by Odins name they will be avenged Its one of the things that makes this superhero stand out from the rest and while I expect devoted fans can call up some textual backup it still feels alien to Thors true appeal. I dont go to ""Thor"" movies for sci-fi action. I go for magic and mystery. Which is a little lacking this time around. We do once again have the charming good-natured and spectacularly well-muscled Chris Hemsworth as the Norseman who shows off his pecs appeal in an early particularly gratuitous bathing scene. And Anthony Hopkins is back as Odin one of the most difficult dads ever. Natalie Portman fulfills her contractual obligations and little else as mortal heroine Jane Foster but Kat Dennings is especially delightful as her wisecracking intern Darcy. In fact Kat Dennings may singlehandedly bring back ""wisecracking."" And as always the most valuable player remains Tom Hiddleston as Loki the trickster. Thought youd seen the last of him in ""The Avengers""? Foolish mortal. Know you not of the precious metal that can be mined simply by having him return in film after film? Honestly Hiddleston has the best part in the movie and although some of his tricks are really kind of cheats (at least as far as the audience is concerned) hes a sly and consistent delight. (And you will love his quick ""Avengers"" joke.) But Taylor doesnt do anything particularly interesting with the staging or the photography and the CGI is so obvious and ever-present that the film begins to take on not the look of fantasy but cheap unreality. And the story -- which brings on one more madmans plan to destroy the universe and one more city-devastating finale -- feels like half-a-dozen other recent superhero movies. Which of course is the whole problem. Thor may not be many peoples favorite superhero. Iron Man is wittier Superman is nobler Spider-man is angstier Batman is darker. But Thor was at least -- always -- different. And this movie makes him just more of the same. Ratings note The film contains violence. Thor The Dark World (PG-13) Disney (120 min.)

"Thor The Dark World (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Thor The Dark World (PG-13) The second screen outing of the popular Marvel Comics superhero succumbs to formula. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/7/2013 Editor rating 2 Theres a fleet and funny comic-book movie nestled inside Thor The Dark World. You catch glimpses of it here and there such as a shot in which the Asgardian hero (Chris Hemsworth) enters a London flat and hangs his hammer on a coat rack as if it were an umbrella or a witty sequence in which Thors villainous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who wreaked all kinds of evil in The Avengers relishes the fact his older sibling is now asking for his help (how convenient). That scene gets the biggest laugh in the entire film. But moments like those are rare. The bulk of this bloated plodding sequel written by Christopher Yost Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the latter two wrote Pain and Gain and Captain America The First Avenger; hows that for diversity?) is just another riff about an ancient being this one named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston unrecognizable under makeup) who wants to destroy the universe -- all known universes actually -- as payback as for an ancient slight against his people. Wasnt this stuff already old hat during the Masters of the Universe days? Even Thanos had more reasonable motivations than the end of everything. The inherent problem in setting the stakes so high is that there is absolutely zero chance the bad guy will triumph. Theres no suspense no thrills no gravity. Sure Malekith may kill a few supporting characters along the way. But Marvel Studios is minting so much money off this fresh batch of superhero pictures theyre not spending too much time coming up with stories that are actually worth telling or even villains with logical motivations. Malekith glowers and poses and make gravelly voiced threats and shoots red CGI tendrils from his hands that bend time or something. Thor both on the screen and on the page has never been much for plausible physics but Thor The Dark World turns the series into a mish-mash of Star Wars and Star Trek and Lord of the Rings and Flash Gordon. Is this science fiction? Mythology? Physics? Mostly its just nonsense even by comic-book standards. The only times were reminded Thor and his brethren are supreme beings (not gods as the movie makes clear) are the scenes in which Odin (Anthony Hopkins rocking that cool gold eye-patch) makes long-winded speeches while standing before his throne or striking a heroic pose. Hopkins does that a lot throughout the movie and he comes off a bit apologetic in those scenes ""Sorry everyone. Im doing the best I can with this material. But you should see how much it pays"" The first Thor movie directed in 2011 by Kenneth Branagh managed to tie the otherwordly realm of Asgard to our planet Thors romance with the scientist Jane (Natalie Portman) was hokey but believable because the movie found the perfect balance between the mythological and reality. You bought them as the most mismatched couple in the history of movies. The new picture the feature debut of Alan Taylor (who directed some of your favorite episodes of Game of Thrones and Mad Men and The Sopranos) comes to life only when Taylor is allowed to veer off the main plot for little throwaway bits like a scene in which Thor is forced to take the London subway (""Which way to Greenwich?"") But the grandness of intergalactic war doesnt seem to interest Taylor much. The films big action setpieces are serviceable but generic and impersonal. Youve seen this stuff before and often. How many times must we be forced to watch a large city demolished by a giant spaceship? Hemsworth continues to pull off the impossible investing a larger-than-life character with humanity and warmth. His Thor is an immensely likable and relatable hero which wasnt always true in the comics but hes stranded in a story that makes next to zero use of his innate likability. Portman and her kooky scientist friends (Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings) come off as clowns -- cheap bits of comic relief to keep this oversized picture from drowning in its own somberness. In the first film these brainiac stooges came off as quirky and funny. Thor The Dark World turns them into buffoons -- geniuses who behave like children (Skarsgard spends a lot of the movie walking around in his underwear because it helps him think). Arent these hapless nerds cute? Arent they hilarious? No. Thor The Dark World amounts to so little even Marvel diehards could skip it altogether if it werent for the last scene -- the only truly surprising moment in the entire movie an ending that makes you wish it had come at the start of the film. At a time when Marvel Studios should be building on their success and embarking on more ambitious narratives Thor The Dark World takes three steps back. This comic-book picture could have starred practically any superhero. The fact that the most interesting character in the entire film (Loki) plays a supporting role is proof of the trouble afoot. Thor The Dark World tries hard to give you something different from the first film. But all the movie accomplishes is to remind you how well the previous picture worked. This is a lot of state-of-the-art sound and fury signifying nothing.

"Review Thor borders on being a bore - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Thor borders on being a boreBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 11/06/2013 120000 PM PSTUpdated 11/06/2013 043614 PM PST Related StoriesNov 7Hicks Netflix soars into superhero businessNetflix orders 4 Marvel superhero shows miniseriesMs. Marvel returns as Muslim teenNov 6Hicks Marvel introducing Muslim female superheroFor a semi-god who has traveled the universe and can pretty much beat the cape off any other force in any dimension with a magic hammer Thor somehow always looks best when surrounded by little old Earth.That was why the first stand-alone film based on the Marvel Comics character worked. Even though it represented the formulaic story line of a big fish stuck in a small pond and even if Natalie Portmans talent was wasted on a role that was much too small for her it worked.Now comes ""Thor The Dark World"" opening Friday which is fun but hardly seems necessary. Its like the Disney/Marvel machine has worked up such a giant head of steam releasing comic book movies that nobody has bothered to notice that some of the movies arent very good. ""Dark World"" could have waited a year or two while someone came up with a more original story. Thats especially so given that the comic book bar has been set so high in recent years with the Dark Knight and Iron Man franchises not to mention the mostly successful Superman reboot.Or maybe Im just disappointed because Thor -- again played with a convincing balance of might and mirth by Chris Hemsworth -- never once uttered ""its hammer time"" before pulverizing a foe into dust. Advertisement The new chapter finds Thor back on his home planet of Asgard when an ancient angry race led by underexplained villain Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) re-emerges to plunge the universe back into darkness by destroying something known as the nine realms. Its based on Norse mythology and its complicated. And frankly the film could have used a better source of motivation. As it is Malekith comes off as powerful sci-fi version of an angry 16-year-old punk rocker. Malekith wants to destroy the status quo and needs the dark matter Aether to do it. As it so happens the Aether has attached itself to Thors girlfriend Jane Foster (Portman with a slightly bigger sassier yet still not-big-enough role this time around). You can see where this is going. Thor reunites with Jane whose outrage at Thors two-year absence seems pretty absurd since she knows as well as we do that he was off saving New York in ""The Avengers."" Together they take on the bad guys and it does not go well. But just when all looks lost -- and when ones head starts to hurt from all the splashy but overcooked special effects -- the story resurrects its best character Thors adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston).Hiddleston saves this movie. Hes become one of those actors -- like Benedict Cumberbatch and at one time Gary Oldman -- who can completely change the direction of an otherwise mediocre film. In prison for his murderous rampage in ""The Avengers"" Hiddleston grabs the second half of ""Thor The Dark World"" and elevates it to the level of his talent. No one ever knows whats motivating the sneering sarcastic patronizing Loki. Hes the greatest used-car salesman in the galaxy. You want to like him you want to believe him but hes simply too smart and conniving to trust. His apparent emergence on the side of good this time allows for badly needed banter between the brothers that sets you up for a either a heroic transformation or a disappointing betrayal. Chris Hemsworth returns in OThor The Dark WorldO which opens Friday in area theaters. (JAY MAIDMENT/Walt Disney Studios/Marvel) And of course Thor is always better on Earth which plays host to all the devastation at the films climax. (That raises the question Why not call on the other Avengers to help?) Though the movies outer-space special effects are pretty -- almost too pretty -- they tend to put the actors and the story on the back burner. Earth provides a better background to focus on whats going on.Unfortunately what goes on at the end isnt very original or even terribly interesting. And its only mildly entertaining which is disappointing after Thors appearance in ""The Avengers."" Of course you should stay through the credits to get your now-obligatory comic-book story surprise. It may be the only one in the entire film.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.THOR THE DARK WORLD  Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence and some suggestive content.Cast Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Tom Hiddleston Anthony Hopkins Jaimie Alexander Christopher Eccleston Kat DenningsDirector Alan TaylorRunning time 1 hour 52 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the last; Deadwood movie still on trackReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Thor The Dark World movie review 2.5 stars - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Thor hammers home same points  1/2In the Dark World Thor masters time travel while fending off Armageddon againNovember 06 2013|Michael PhillipsChris Hemsworth stars in ""Thor The Dark World."" (Jay Maidment/Marvel)""Thor The Dark World"" is the eighth movie in its particular franchise. So if anyone asks you what it has in common with ""Blondie Goes Latin"" and ""Bomba and the Jungle Girl"" youll know the answer.The franchise at hand goes by the name of the Marvel Cinematic Universe encompassing the new adventures of Iron Man the Hulk Captain America and so on worth billions around the world. (Rumor has it the next all-star ""Avengers"" movie will be two hours of actors in costume counting their money.) So hows this ""Thor"" sequel? Its fairly entertaining. Same old threats of galaxy annihilation spiced with fish-out-of-water jokes. My favorite here Encountering a London flat for the first time in his travels Chris Hemsworths Thor comes in the door and hangs his snazzy flying killer hammer from its leather loop on one of the coat hooks.This is the second outing for mighty Thor and his mighty hammer though honestly what chance have they against Tom Hiddleston as Odins other less trustworthy son Loki? The chief adversary from the first ""Thor"" (which I liked in spite of its squareness) and the hugely popular mash-up ""The Avengers"" has a way of making valor and honor look foolish. Clearly director Alan Taylor whose previous work has mostly been in classy series television (lately ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Boardwalk Empire"") likes this character best because he snivels most.Now for some very important plot points. In ""Thor 2"" Malekith the leader of the dark elves of Svartalfheim comes out of a long hibernation ready to rumble. Their secret weapon is the aether pronounced ""ee-ther"" an ""ancient force of infinite destruction"" as Anthony Hopkins Odin describes it sounding like hes saying the words ""blah blah blah"" instead.When some of the aether enters the bloodstream of astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman once again) things get sticky. At the end of ""Thor 1"" Thor took off back to Asgard leaving Jane bereft. ""Thor 2"" ponders the challenges of intergalactic dating and the film has its scrambled moments where one beat of an action sequence begins on Earth and then two seconds later the second beat is completed at the other end of the tunnel. After a while anythings possible and little is compelling even though its on Asgard where Jane meets Thors folks. Other scenes takes place on Vanaheim which is like Anaheim without Disneyland.Taylor handles the battle sequences dutifully and without much visual dynamism. (If you go to ""Thor 2"" dont bother with the 3-D edition. Twos enough.) By now in this Marvel world weve seen everything twice and its hard to impress audiences with something new. But we dont go to ""Thor 2"" or any of these films really for something new. We go because we saw the other ones. The most satisfying films of the eight so far -- the first ""Iron Man"" and ""Captain America The First Avenger"" -- did the job with a lighter hand and a less pummeling attack.The occasional charms of ""Thor 2"" are all about the way Kat Dennings (back again as Janes intern) deadpans her way through another Armageddon or Hopkins stunning final-t consonant enunciation when he bites off the end of the word ""birthright."" Or Hiddlestons malevolent grin the mocking face of sibling rivalry. Plenty of fine actors do what they can here amid the digital mayhem and smashed columns.

(JAY MAIDMENT) B- Thor The Dark World Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Idris Elba Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman; Director Alan Taylor; Release Date Wide 11/08/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 112; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted November 20 2013 -- 1200 AM EST Every superhero movie is on some level an attempt to demonstrate that a godlike being with flabbergasting powers -- he flies He wields a megaton hammer -- also has an inner life. The success of the film hinges on how well it yokes together the external and the internal. Thor The Dark World a watchable but technologically overscaled slab of Marvel boilerplate is far from a great superhero movie -- its more like the diagram for one. Having done his time as a magical Norse hunk-out-of-water in Thor (2011) and The Avengers (2012) our hero (Chris Hemsworth) now finds himself back on Asgard. There his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins serving up his own special brand of highbrow scenery chewing) enlists him in a battle for the cosmos. The Nine Realms are about to converge which means that the Dark Elves led by the scowling Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) can now finally seize their moment to destroy Asgard. Are your eyes already glazing over? To succeed the Elves must gain control of the Aether (pronounced ""ether"") a supreme energy force in the form of what looks like a floating spill of red wine. In the films rather desperate attempt to personalize the plot the Aether which requires a host organism has leaped inside the body of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) the astrophysicist who fell for Thor and has been waiting two years for him to return. Portman plays her like a petulant schoolgirl and thats the movies notion of a joke Jane just wants a boyfriend while Thor who loves her back has weightier concerns. Really though The Dark World should have given Jane a better reason for hanging around than the fact that shes playing host body to a glob of extraterrestrial protoplasm. The first Thor was directed by Kenneth Branagh with an elegant verve that made the special effects at once witty and spectacular. Alan Taylor who directed this sequel is a prestige veteran of the small screen (Mad Men The Sopranos Game of Thrones) but he brings little of that avid storytelling tightness to The Dark World. The new film sprawls often with more spirit than reason. And though its images can be exciting (the Oz-like palace of Asgard airships that glide like daggers) the battles have a videogame medieval dazzle that temporarily heightens the senses then leaves you numb. Hemsworths Thor is once again a charismatically fast and bold stud-Viking warrior but now that hes mostly on his home planet (with occasional forays down to London) he somehow seems less super. Only when Tom Hiddleston is on screen as Thors dark-souled stepbrother Loki does any real drama take hold. Loki has been imprisoned for his treachery but it turns out that Thor needs his help to defeat the Dark Elves. Can he trust Loki not to betray him? Hiddleston with pleading eyes and a mad-dog grin plays Loki as a wounded sociopath whos cackling at the world but seething on the inside. Which makes you realize hes just about the only character in the movie who has an inside.

If it seemed mildly eccentric for Marvel and Disney to schedule the release of ""Thor The Dark World"" in November customarily the zone of adult-oriented Oscar bait the result will apparently be yet another huge worldwide hit. They probably did it more than anything else because the standard May-to-July corridors both this year and next were already overcrowded with costumed heroes and otherworldly evildoers.Over the last decade or so the struggle for pop-culture supremacy has slightly tilted toward the Marvel Comics world of Thor Iron Man Captain America and the Avengers (along with Spider-man) and away from the DC realm of Superman and Batman. But the two empires remain in rough balance and the result is something like a steady-state universe which also describes how I felt about ""Thor The Dark World."" Its a highly capable sequel that drinks long and deep from the established Marvel legendarium and brings back all the key players from Kenneth Branaghs 2011 hit ""Thor"" Agreeable Aussie hunk Chris Hemsworth as the Thunder God Natalie Portman as his Earthling scientist lover (entirely unconvincing) Tom Hiddleston as Loki the conniving trickster of Asgard (awesome as always) and Anthony Hopkins punching the clock a little less obviously than usual as Odin the one-eyed Allfather and guardian of the Nine Realms.Veteran TV director Alan Taylor (most recently of ""Game of Thrones"") takes the reins for what feels very much like the middle chapter of a trilogy and has many of the expected problems. What I enjoyed about the film and what I found annoying nearly canceled each other out so that after two hours of noise and battle scenes and high-end CGI effects and conversations in the proto-Icelandic dialect of the Svartalfen or Dark Elves it almost seemed as if I hadnt had the experience at all or as if this bewildering jumble of fantasy ingredients really were composed of miscellaneous bits and pieces of other movies Ive already seen. Heres what I liked the nerdy density of the storytelling and the evident respect for the comic-book audience; Hiddlestons irresistibly feminine sneer and the admixture of regret and diabolical cunning on his face; Idris Elba even standing still and doing nothing; cinematographer Kramer Morgenthaus spooky spectral shots of Portman floating in womblike interstellar space wreathed in tendrils of red goo.Most superhero movies and especially the Marvel films remain imprisoned by genre convention in a way that larger containers like science fiction or horror or mystery have long since transcended. Of course most sci-fi and horror are mediocre - because most things are mediocre period - but anyone who tried to claim those genres were incapable of carrying philosophy or political allegory or social satire or insights into the human condition would be laughed out of town and rightfully so. Comic-book movies have all that detailed back-story behind them familiar to a large portion of their audience and also have to satisfy the formulaic expectations of the action-adventure spectacle in which large portions of the picture become an ear-splitting and visually incoherent assault the cultural equivalent of a 64-ounce vat of Mountain Dew. You Might Also Like Christopher Nolan managed to turn that formula toward his own ends in the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy and his protege Zack Snyder certainly tried to in ""Man of Steel."" But most of the time in this kind of film were left to discuss picayune technical points as with Kabuki theater or porn or 70s kung-fu movies How badass are the villains? (Really just your standard pointy-eared blue-skinned aliens with a bit of Norse mythology layered on top.) How great are Elbas stoical line deliveries? (Pretty great.) Any new areas of Asgard we havent seen before? (A drinking hall very ""Lord of the Rings."") Does Odin once again appear to wish he were on the beach getting high rather than ruling the universe? (A bit.) What major Earth landmarks will be destroyed? (The Royal Naval College in Greenwich England the spot where all nine realms of Yggdrasil are lining up like billiard balls or something.)See Natalie Portman has been mooning around on our planet doing astrophysics and waiting for her Thunder God lover-man to come back but then she accidentally enters another dimension and has this glowing red ooze called the Aether enter her body. I know; that sounds hot but it mostly isnt. See something called the Convergence is happening which involves Stellan Skarsgard getting naked at Stonehenge and the Dark Elves who once ruled the universe getting another chance to destroy all of creation and once again have a dominion of gloom and chaos. And fair enough I kind of see their argument. All normal physics is suspended and gods objects and people go careening from one universe to another which is fun to watch but extremely confusing. Natalie even gets a booty call from her other boyfriend while she and Thor are stuck in a cave in Svartalfheim realm of the Dark Elves. Embarrassing In a desperate attempt to head off this apocalypse Thor ultimately has to set Loki his villainous but inventive foster brother free from the prison cell he has inhabited since the end of the last movie. These are by far the best scenes of the film both because Hiddleston is a crack-up at almost every moment and because he makes this comic-book gloss on a mythological deity feel completely convincing. As in the actual Norse legends this trickster Loki is an adversary of the gods who is also bound to them and sometimes helps them; Hiddleston actually makes you feel the anguish of a character who genuinely loves those he betrays and who often wishes he could be better than he is.I cant say much about the other actors and really what difference does it make? Hemsworth is pliable enough as lumps of granite go (he was much better in ""Rush"") while Portman is miscast. Not one but two major Asgardian figures die in this movie which establishes and maintains a tone of somber grandiosity and as Marvel-movie devotees will expect theres a post-credits stinger suggesting that Benicio del Toro will play the series next villain. As to the question of whether ""Thor The Dark World"" is a ""good movie"" worth an entire evening of your life and the relevant cash outlay heres how to decide When Thor enters his girlfriends London apartment he carefully hangs his big honking hammer by its strap on a coathook inside the door. If you think thats funny or at least understand why its supposed to be then youre good. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

(MARVEL) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday November 5 2013 200 AM Title Thor The Dark World Film Info PG-13 Violence. Opens Thursday night at area theaters. 3-D where available. What weird sorcery is this? ""Thor The Dark World"" may not be thunder from the movie gods but it is -- shock -- an entertaining journey into mystery action and fun. That wasnt a preordained outcome. Thors 2011 Marvel Comics film adaptation -- a crucial set-up for ""The Avengers"" -- was a dull deal with giant robots attacking empty southwestern towns and a brawny Norse mythology-derived alien superbeing. As directed by Kenneth Branagh it tried too hard to bridge worlds. Not so with the sequel. Director Alan Taylor a TV vet (""Six Feet Under"" ""The Sopranos"" and most crucially ""Game of Thrones"") has given ""The Dark World"" both a light touch and a streamlined feel. It cruises where the earlier film lumbered. Theres also a jolt in here of ""Lord of the Rings."" It has its faults but this is solidly in the upper sphere of superhero sequels. Tom Hiddleston as Loki in Thor The Dark World Two years after Thor (Chris Hemsworth) helped the Avengers quash his evil adopted brother Lokis (Tom Hiddleston) plan to rule Earth the blond God of Thunder is a good son to Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and misses pretty Earth girl Jane (Natalie Portman). But a ""dark elf"" named Malekith (unrecognizable Christopher Eccleston) is after a funky mist called the Aether. This were told can be used to return the universe (aka the Nine Realms) to darkness. Jane happens to find the Aether in a chasm on Earth and absorbs it. Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Hopkins as Odin in Thor The Dark World To extract it and protect the Nine Realms Thor brings Jane to his disco-lit world of Asgard. But once Malekith gets the Aether and brings it to his home Svartalfheim (gesundheit) Thors only hope is to free Loki from his Asgardian prison and set off together on a tenuous partnership to defeat Malekith. Thats a lot of gobbledygook and reads like the fine print on a game of Dungeons amp; Dragons. Yet ""The Dark World"" keeps its feet on the ground. Hemsworth has evolved into the Marvel version of Errol Flynn -- he balances swashbuckling with sly humor -- and Portman has grown into an appealingly feisty heroine. Her cute snarky sidekick Darcy (Kat Dennings) is a welcome return as is Stellan Skarsgard as their now-brain-fried scientist mentor. Natalie Portman in Thor The Dark World As it goes with superhero flicks the true believers are the ones wholl groove on it the most. In fact anyone who considers a giant hammer (called Mjolnir as if you didnt know) as cool as a lightsaber or the Batmobile likely has more invested in the story than the average moviegoer.Lets face it the real villain here is essentially a gloomy meteorological phenomenon. The secret weapon is Hiddleston. The best thing the films army of five screenwriters did is set the odd couple of Thor and Loki on a sort-of celestial road trip. Loki is puckish malevolent peevish magnetic and with his Rooney Mara-like pale skin and dark hair the polar opposite of Hemsworth. Hiddlestons villainous asides steal the show and he brightens ""The Dark World"" when it needs it most. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

On the surface the two movies have little in common The sequel to 2011s ""Thor"" is the latest edition to Disneys vast commercial enterprise as it continues to beef up its expansive translation of Marvel comics to the big screen; ""How I Live Now"" is director Kevin Macdonalds quiet stirring adaptation of Meg Rosoffs acclaimed novel about a group of young people struggling to survive in the English countryside after the outbreak of World War III. Yet the timing of their releases leads to an intriguing contrast between radically different approaches to exploring collective fears through the same medium. In ""How I Live Now"" 15-year-old moody teen Daisy (Saoirse Ronan) travels from New York to the United Kingdom and moves in with her distant cousins in attempt to flee her stepmother. Once there shes initially resistant to her affable relatives Isaac (Tom Holland) and Piper (Harley Bird) both several years younger than her but quickly -- maybe just a little too quickly -- falls under the spell of the kindly stud Edmond (George MacKay) a hunk willing to romantically suck the blood from her wounded finger as the two make their way through the lush countryside and before long lock lips. As their situation grows dire -- with the familys sole adult presence out of town as nukes hit London leaving the kids to their own devices in an untempered war zone -- Edmond is the storys mythical centerpiece An almost comically brawny source of comfort for the unstable heroine hes her only source of potential salvation. When he drops out of the picture as the group gets pulled apart by militant forces halfway through he becomes a symbolic goal that gives Daisy a reason to fight through incarceration at a work camp and find her way back to their tranquil farm away from the chaos afflicting the rest of the country. The device is effectively ambiguous Its never entirely clear until the closing moments whether Daisys constant dreams of Edmond beckoning to her mean shes on the right track or if shes simply lost in an impossible scenario with no hope of a happy ending. Its as if shes constructed her very own superhero Hes her personal Thor. No matter how cheesy their romance (and yes it does get distractingly cheesy in parts) her vision as Edmond as the key to her salvation makes ""How I Live Now"" not so much a form of escapism as an ode to its powers. And thats certainly to a far simpler degree what ""Thor"" does too. At the end of ""The Avengers"" Thor (Chris Hemsworth) himself has vanished from our world to take his scheming war-mongering brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) back to Asgard for imprisonment in the process leaving behind his own hardened damsel in distress Researcher Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) Thors main partner in crime during the first movie and his tentative romantic interest. After a lengthy prologue too heavily steeped in mythological babble to merit much description here its established that Thor has been tied down in his homeland battling off evil forces from one of the evil realms attempting to overthrow Asgard. Needless to say when Thor eventually materializes in our universe to greet Jane she accepts his excuse with an amusingly defeatist response. How can you argue with this dreamy valiant impossibly muscular god among men? Janes unhurried acceptance of Thors absence marks one of a few enjoyably self-aware moments in this generally agreeable CGI-fest which has been competently directed by Alan Taylor although one could argue at this point that none of these intertwined blockbusters bear the mark of any single filmmaker aside from Joss Whedon. Like Whedons whip-smart ""Avengers"" screenplay ""Thor The Dark World"" manages to acknowledge the inherently silly nature of its premise while compellingly asserting that hey sometimes its fun to suspend your disbelief when the results look this good. Just go with it and the latest ""Thor"" like its precedents manages to make the ominous threat of a menacing inter-dimensional warlord pretty enjoyable if equally forgettable. To some degree thats all one can expect at this point ""Thor The Dark World"" has been engineered to be yet another hole-filler in the hulking ""Avengers"" franchise and expertly designed to keep multiple storylines in flux at once (including one tagged to the current  ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D"" television series and another that looks ahead to the upcoming ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie) while instigating a massive drumroll for Whedons ""Avengers"" sequel. But whats interesting about this universe is that by virtue of the multiple narratives in play it manages to reference countless story ingredients without fully explaining them. Its entirely acceptable for everyone in ""Thor The Dark World"" to still discuss the wounds of the New York City showdown that concluded ""The Avengers"" which was released a year after ""Thor."" Even in the context of this utterly absurd slice of mass produced spectacle ""Thor The Dark World"" manages to convey the notion of people living in the shadows of a conflict far larger than a single movie has the power to contain. ""How I Live Now"" also involves a handful of characters swept up in the aftermath of an attack (albeit one far more devastating and believable) that save for a fleeting news report remains entirely off-screen. Though it aims for realism where ""Thor"" and its ilk fly magnificently off the rails ""How I Live Now"" similarly hints at a bigger world without fleshing out all the details. What matters is the way a handful of frantic individuals react to the impact of a global catastrophe for their specific needs. Even if the rather basic set of events creates the sense of an unfinished scenario its that same quality that makes it feel hauntingly credible. The through-line between ""Thor"" and ""How I Live Now"" suggests that both movies reflect a specific breed of post-9/11 paranoia in which the plight of the individual has become swept up by far greater circumstances. Marvels superheroes are the response we can only dream about when contemplating mass destruction from monolithic forces of evil. But ""How I Live Now"" explores the ramifications of what happens when nobody comes to the rescue and the victims only prospects for survival remain their own feeble devices. Hearing whispering voices in her head as she traipses through the forest evading gun-toting militants and rapists alike Daisy eventually transforms into a self-made heroine empowered by her perseverance. In that regard like ""Thor"" Macdonalds movie is a kind of fairy tale. While in the Marvel franchises the good guys always win ""The House I Live In"" explores the far more tangible process of simply remaining alive at all costs -- and finding against impossible odds justification for living through another day. Criticwire Grades ""How I Live Now"" B+ ""Thor The Dark World"" B HOW WILL THEY PLAY? While ""Thor"" is poised to win the box office this weekend ""The House I Live In"" should do reasonably well on VOD due to its enticing premise and Ronans appeal. However its box office chances during the crowded fall season are fairly limited.

TWITTER The saga continues in Marvelas second solo outing for Chris Hemsworthas brawny superhero and Tom Hiddlestonas wicked Loki picking up where ""The Avengers"" left off Nobody gives good sneer like Tom Hiddleston back once again in the pleather leggings and goat-horned helmet to play bad guy Loki in Thor The Dark World and pretty much steal the whole show. Amiable hunk Chris Hemsworth may play the title character in this subset of Marvels meta-Avengers franchise but this well-intentioned ""witless oaf"" as his evil foster brother describes him at one point is practically a guest at his own party here as scads of new characters and millions of dollars worth of CGI crowd the screen. Most of it pales into insignificance when Loki takes the stage which isnt often enough given how wildly uneven the sections without him are. Although director Alan Taylor manages to get things going properly for the final battle in London the long stretches before that on Asgard and the other branches of Yggdrasil are a drag like filler episodes of Game of Thrones but without the narrative complexity mythical heft or all-pervading sexiness. PHOTOS Exclusive Portraits of Chris Hemsworth In a year when so many box-office sure bets especially sequels have been a bust its harder than usual to predict how well Thor The Dark World will do. Tracking numbers are predicting an opening weekend somewhere in the 75 million stratosphere. Meh word of mouth could diminish returns over the subsequent weeks but who knows. There are a lot of die-hard fans out there especially for the Marvel-verse but then again they can also be a very discerning and exacting audience. The opening sequence provides backstory on the Dark Elves sharp-beaked pointy-eared meanies from Alfheim who date back to before the beginning of time and claim a black gaseous substance called Aether as their all-powerful weapon of mass destruction. Theyre seen being vanquished (but of course not quite) by Thors grandfather. Thereafter the story basically picks up where The Avengers left off with Loki in manacles back on Thors home planet -- or ""realm"" they call it -- Asgard after trying to take over our world and trashing New York in the process. His glass-walled whited-out cell in the dungeon bears a striking resemblance to similar baddie-holding pens in films past from the X-Men franchise to Skyfall; there he reads books and has heart-to-black-heart chats with his adopted mother Frigga (Rene Russo finally getting more to do in this installment than just standing around smiling). In uppity other realms Thor has been putting down insurgents alongside his warrior buddies -- the Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the ""Warriors Three"" Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) and Fandral (Zachary Levi stepping in for Josh Dallas) -- and preparing to take over from dad Odin (Anthony Hopkins) as king. Since the Bifrost bridge that connects Asgard to Earth was destroyed two films back Thor has no means to travel to our world to see Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) the fetching lady scientist he became smitten with in the first movie but barely mentioned in The Avengers. Luckily omnipotent bridge-keeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) can see shes basically fine albeit mightily annoyed with Thor for not staying in touch. Based in London now shes trying to heal her wounded pride by having a blind date with nice but decidedly non-godly Richard (Chris ODowd criminally underused). She dumps him unceremoniously as soon as her intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) who now has her own intern (Jonathan Howard) interrupts their meal with evidence of a space-fabric disturbance that seems familiar. While investigating the weird phenomenon Jane is sucked into another realm and infected with Aether which sometimes give her scary white-free eyes evoking happy memories of Black Swan. PHOTOS Behind the Scenes of Thor It turns out that The Convergence the incredibly rare astronomical alignment of all nine realms is beginning hence the possibility of Bifrost-free travel between Earth and Asgard. Thor comes to collect Jane gets slapped a few times for not calling her and they commute back to Asgard to see its intricate landscape of cavernous assembly halls and gleaming golden towers fashioned in the forge of many a mainframe all impressively conceived and executed by production designer Charles Wood and visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison. That said some of the more barren landscapes look decidedly less convincing with their papier-mache boulders and screen-like backdrops when Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) the leader of the surviving Dark Elves and his crew come to try and collect their Aether. The middle section is mostly a muddle with endless cross-cutting between the Dark Elves plotting attacking and then retreating to plot some more earthlings Darcy and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) worrying and the Asgardians bickering over what they should do. The latter finally decide -- despite manifest evidence provided by two previous films that it would be a very bad idea -- to release Loki from jail so that he can fight on their side. Once Loki is back in play magisterially sneering and loftily dispensing one-liners the whole thing perks up again. Until that is hes off the scene again for reasons which cant be revealed. The final showdown in Greenwich London squares off the Dark Elves and their unleashed Aether against the Asgardians and humans managing in the process to grind most of Sir Christopher Wrens exquisite 17th century Royal Naval College buildings into a fine powdery digitally rendered pixel dust. Its here in this stretch that the film finally gets its mojo back finding the requisite balance between bombast and wise-cracks that made the first Thor work in its finest moments. Admittedly nothing Loki-unrelated in Thor The Dark World quite matches the hilarity of the scene in the first film where Thor strides into a pet shop and demands a horse but the finale pleasingly gives the hardworking supports a chance to josh around the stereoscopy comes into its own and the editing credited to Dan Lebental and Wyatt Smith finds its groove. What a shame the script up until this point is too often so ramshackle and plodding like the writers were finishing off the dialogue in between catering breaks. With a project so firmly supervised by its studio its hard to tell how much director Alan Taylor should be credited or blamed for the finished result. The Dark World is certainly a far cry from the jaunty little indie crime caper Palookaville (1995) he started his career with. Since then hes directed some great episodes on some of the very best TV series including The Sopranos Mad Men and most germane of all in this context Game of Thrones on which he also serves as a co-executive producer. Perhaps its unfair to compare Thrones with The Dark World given the former has so much more scope to build its world over hours of programming but for all the budget spent on lavish visual effects in The Dark World nothing in it quite compares to the White Walkers marching relentlessly through the snowy Northern wastes at the end of the Taylor-directed episode ""Valar Morghulis."" Viewers are advised to not make for the exit as soon as the end credits start rolling and stick it out until the very end if they want to see a postscript that reveals a character who may prove central to the next film. Indeed the end credits have two Easter-egg scenes in keeping with the trickle of in-jokes aimed at Marvel aficionados that provides a flash-quick cameo for one of Thors superhero companions from The Avengers.

Were in the midst of another banner annum for quality American (and American studio) filmmaking with 2013 looking to be on par with the fondly remembered renaissance years of 2007 and 1999. For those of us whove binged on so much substantial cinema over the past two months its easy enough to forget that everything isnt rich Oscar-fodder pate; awards season or not the menu still consists of year-round courses of meaty refuse stuffed into hot-dog skins slathered in condiments to hide the taste and sold in bulk. Which brings us to the new Thor film or as journalist Mark Harris recently referred to it as Thor 2 Thor Harder. When last seen the Norse God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth)--the one who bears a striking resemblance to Fabio you remember him--was defending Gothamites from the hordes of aliens unleashed by his trickster brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) during the oft-mentioned Battle of New York. (See Avengers The.) Since then the blond-tressed hunk has been keeping himself occupied with the usual traipsing-among-the-nine-realms business fighting alongside his warrior brethren and in the case of Jaimie Alexanders lovelorn Sif sister-ren. Trouble is brewing down on Earth however as Thors inamorata Jane Foster (Natlaie Portman) has stumbled across the ""Ether""--an ancient black mist that has long been coveted by ""the Dark Elves"" in the time of Odins father. She becomes its vessel. The head elf (et tu Christopher Eccleston?) wants to get his hands on her. Shit as it apt to do goes down. Over the rainbow bridge we go once more with viewers being treated to a hodgepodge of Mythology 101 midterm answers generically LOTR-ish battle scenes sci-fi flotsam and jetsam Marvelverse in-jokes (clever way to work in an Avengers castmate cameo fellas) and Anthony Hopkins bellowing in his best plummy Shakespearean baritone. Anyone whos read the comic books knows this is keeping with the source material yet theres something remarkably rote and rickety about all of this even by second-tier superhero-movie standards; after Joss Whedon rewrote the rules for this companys franchises The Dark Worlds high-price-tag fantasy trash--think of the 80s rayguns-and-Velveeta sagas that New World Pictures used to churn out only minus the campy rush--feel especially threadbare. Even its deafening bells and whistles are boring. Its not like director Alan Taylor doesnt have chops either; the man has spent the past 15 years working on every one of HBOs major shows and clearly knows how to serve someone elses vision while delivering the dramatic/comedic/fantastic goods. But none of that much less the glossy fun that Marvel movies delivered while DC Comics adaptations went dark and somber is present here. This is a superhero movie that feels like it might have been made by anyone and no one at the same time simply space-filler before the next big team-up movie. Per usual theres a coda that sets the scene for an upcoming entry in the ever-expanding multi-title network a peek at what to expect from 2014s Guardians of the Galaxy flick. The question youre left with is who is going to save Marvel from itself?

Photo Jay Maidment MOVIE REVIEW Thor The Dark World Too hokey and jokey Loki. Running time 120 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence profanity). At the Kips Bay the Empire the Union Square others. Its a dark dark dark dark world. How dark is ""Thor The Dark World""? So dark that when the Hammerin Hunk stops by Earth someone asks ""So hows . . . space?"" ""Space is . . . fine"" he says. Its as if someone asked Batman how often he gets rubber wedgies. Actually I think that line did appear in ""Batman amp; Robin"" and if that (or ""The Mummy Returns"" or ""The Fantastic Four"" ) is your idea of a superhero movie Thors combination of half-hearted action and dim jokes is exactly what youre looking for. If ""The Lord of the Rings"" was ancient legends sifted through the sensibility of an Oxford professor of Anglo-Saxon studies then ""Thor The Dark World"" is grand Norse myth run through the minds of 9-year-olds. ""Hey what if Odin lowered his staff and laser bullets came out?"" ""Yeah Blam Blam"" This time after the events of ""The Avengers"" Thors girl Jane (Natalie Portman) has been left sighingly behind on Earth and evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is in prison on Asgard while Thor (Chris Hemsworth) fights a series of wars to unite the Nine Realms. These arent the kinds of epic battles where you have to break a sweat A giant rock-monster approaches Thor and with one swing of the Magic Mallet and a couple of snarky one-liners it is reduced to gravel. Asgards ancient elfy enemies seemingly defeated eons ago are instead taking a cosmic nap and awaiting their next chance to harvest the game-changing magical power the Aether. Thors father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) thought his own father had sent the Aether to a place where it would never be seen again. But they should have thought of the obvious place -- Thursday nights on NBC. As it is the dark force slips out of space like a galactic hernia and falls into an abandoned factory in London where lil astrophysicist Darcy (Kat Dennings) finds it and alerts Jane who gets infected with the all-consuming force. Thor steps through a wrinkle in space and brings her back to his Asgard home where the Dark Elves plot to harvest the Aether coursing through her. Oh and theres a once-every-5000-year event called the Convergence that briefly lines up all the galactic systems in a row like a giant bulls-eye for the Dark Elves. Fooling you into thinking the bad guys have a chance is what these movies are all about but that never happens here. ""Dark World"" is as narratively gripping as if the pages of the IKEA catalog attacked one another. (Watch out Olofstorp is massed for battle against Lindved) I think even the filmmakers (TV director Alan Taylor and a squadron of screenwriters) would be surprised if you ever became emotionally engaged. One vanishingly minor characters funeral takes up pretty much the same amount of screen time as that figure has enjoyed in the whole movie and were supposed to tear up? Nah its just that pagan funerals provide lots of CGI opportunity the lonely boat floating out to sea the archers firing arrows into it the waterfall the spirit ascending. Cool. A dogfight is similarly meaningless Thor has decided to turn traitor disobey his father (as always) and fight his own brother warriors. Fratricide looms. Heavy stuff youd think but instead its all played for a lark. (Nobody seems to get hurt or if they do nobody cares.) When Thor brings up the idea he does it in a jokey way and later there are no consequences whatsoever. I think Jane even refers to it as ""treason and stuff"" or maybe she calls it ""kinda treason-y."" Whatever. Oh and if a characters hand should get cut off? It just pops back 30 seconds later. ""Dark World"" is low-stakes low-emotion lowbrow. Guess how high my interest level was?

Surely the vast cinematic universe that the team at Marvel has meticulously laid out requires some elements of ""Thor The Dark World"" to be put into place before launching into their next wave of productions but it doesnt seem like coincidence that the only seemingly essential bits of the film take place in its final third the only redeeming section of the entire outing. Its not that the first seventy-five minutes of ""Thor The Dark World"" are bad (although they are) but its that theyre so packed with meaningless exposition and messy action that they actually read as indecipherable. Whole chunks of the film simply fail to make sense and the required suspension of disbelief effectively robs any emotional engagement audiences could make with the material. When you ask us to treat everything like a trick or a bit of magic or simply a poorly edited piece of film youre also asking us to disengage with anything that comes with realistic merits. The result is the cinematic equivalent of getting hit on the head by Thors hammer (painful and confusing). The second ""Thor"" feature (and rest assured there will be a third) flips the script on the original to numbing effect. Whereas the first ""Thor"" outing worked because it took obvious glee in its fish out of water premise giddily placing the thunderstruck Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in a small New Mexico town and watching him literally bump against everything in his path from coffee cups to Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) ""Thor The Dark World"" sees the Norse God of Thunder back at home in dreamy old Asgard. The film picks up after the assault on New York City as portrayed in ""The Avengers"" and Thor has kept himself busy in the interval (approximately two Earth years we soon learn) thanks to continued skirmishes across the rest of the Nine Realms that he and his merry band of broheims are tasked with snuffing out. Its not easy being the biggest baddest warrior in Asgard except that for Thor it actually is and its not very interesting stuff. The real problem with Thor as a character is that on his own hes not very interesting - he requires other characters to smash against to create something compelling be it humorous or dramatic (Tony Stark for instance is wholly amusing and entertaining on his own and doesnt need other people to make him zing as a character). Even Thors emotional blockades - not knowing if he wants to be king the little problem of his locked up brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston excellent as ever) missing Jane - dont give him much depth and both Thor and ""Thor The Dark World"" scream out for something resembling actual drama and trauma. Theyll get it thanks to the Dark Elves introduced to us by way of a long-form and wholly lackluster sequence that attempts to explain their origins (theyre from the darkness whatever that means) their power source (something called the Aether) their leader (Christopher Eccleston utterly wasted here) and their seemingly final losing battle (Thors grandpapa and his army killed ""all"" of them though we soon learn they didnt do a very complete job of it). The remaining Dark Elves have been dormant for centuries but a coming cosmic event that only a perennially pantless Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) seems to know about threatens to free them and unleash the now-hidden Aether. While Selvig wanders in his skivvies across England the mopey Jane and her ever-ready sidekick Darcy (the wryly wonderful Kat Dennings) find themselves engaged in their favorite activity - running around with pieces of scientific machinery in their hands yelling about numbers. This time around yelling and numbers and machines take them to an abandoned London factory where a pack of cute kids show them something weird - a wormhole that occasionally doesnt bother to return the various items they toss down it. Jane inevitably gets sucked into a different portion of the wormhole between realms and returns to Earth jam-packed with the Aether (what a coincidence). Back on Asgard rainbow bridge guardian Heimdall (Idris Elba) tells Thor that young Jane disappeared from his vision for a spell sending Thor down to Earth desperate to make sure shes okay (you could have called Thor you could have called two years ago too). Jane is not okay however and the pair soon returns to Asgard briefly putting the ol switcheroo on the fish out of water tale before a band of recently reanimated elves led by Ecclestons Malekith come looking for whatever is swimming through Janes veins. What follows is a mixed-up mash-up of drama and emotion action and war exposition and confusion none of which appears to actually matter all of which takes up far too much of the films running time. Gone is the humor and heart of the first ""Thor"" and whats left is a head-scratching series of events that stretch the limits of ""but its a magical superhero movie"" to its breaking point. And yet after two acts of muddled exposition and action-packed sequences meant to alleviate the boredom ""Thor The Dark World"" finally finds it footing - by thrusting Thor back onto Earth and thus capitalizing on both the wacky weirdness of seeing him thump about the planet and a series of quickly moving action sequences that actually make a smattering of sense. ""Thor The Dark World"" evidently has good stuff - we see it for the films final half an hour - a solid marrying of tone and action that makes everything else that comes before it seem still worse and more grating highlighting the films issues even as it flies in to rescue the entire production. If only all of ""Thor The Dark World"" could capture the magic of its last act the film wouldnt feel like such a chink in Marvels otherwise solid armor.

(AP Photo/Walt Disney Studios/Marvel) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press on November 04 2013 at 231 PM updated November 04 2013 at 239 PM comments Even diehards may wish for something more from a Marvel equation that often subtracts humanity. ""Thor The Dark World"" a Walt Disney release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence and some suggestive content."" Running time 111 minutes. Two stars out of four. Comic book movies are increasingly like Sandra Bullock in ""Gravity"" lost in space. Following the summers glumly bombastic ""Man of Steel"" which added a heavy dose of Krypton politics to Supermans once pleasantly silly story comes ""Thor The Dark World"" in which Thors Asgard a celestial home of gods floating somewhere in the universe is the primary setting. Earth is an afterthought - just one of the ""nine realms"" albeit the one with Natalie Portman. Gone are the earthbound pleasures of a superhero amid us mortals. Such was the joy of the ""Spider-Man"" movies and the first ""Thor"" when Chris Hemsworths lofty hammer-wielding Norse warrior exiled to Earth so happily encountered a cup of coffee for the first time. As Marvels latest 3-D behemoth ""Thor The Dark World"" isnt so much a sequel as the latest plug-and-play into the comic book companys blockbuster algorithm. Its a reliably bankable formula of world-saving action sequences new villain introductions and clever quips from women on the side (and they most assuredly are always off to the side). The expansive Marvel universe is carefully stitched together across its many properties. ""The Dark World"" (with director Alan Taylor of ""Game of Thrones"" taking over for Kenneth Branaugh) follows ""The Avengers"" in chronology and runs alongside the current unremarkable ABC series ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" Each is referred to with something less than say the binding connections of Faulkners Yoknapatawpha County. Instead we get cloying winks. The great city of New York for example is reduced to shorthand for the climactic battle in ""The Avengers"" as if were still so consumed by that movie. Yes were all very impressed it made so much money. Thor has spent the last two years restoring order to the nine realms of the cosmos but just as peace settles a previously locked-away dark energy called the Aether seeps out. It leaks into Portmans astrophysicist Jane Foster awakening a previously vanquished species of Dark Elves led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). They would like to see the universe returned to complete darkness. Not a day person this Malekith. This occurs as the nine realms are lining up in a rare convergence that makes them particularly susceptible to Aether-spread ruin. Theres not a lick of character to Malekith and his motives He just wants to end all life. To save Life As We Know It Thor seeks help from his duplicitous adoptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who has been imprisoned for killing thousands of humans at ""New York."" Hiddlestons sneering Loki remains one of the finest Marvel antagonists and - now with a starring role in three films - the franchise seems to value him (as it should) as much as his more heroic brother. When ""The Dark World"" touches down on Earth away from the ""Clash of the Titans""-style realms of gods its considerably better. Along with Portman returning is the sarcasm sidekick Kat Dennings (as Janes intern) and Stellan Skarsgard as discredited scientist Erik Selvig. Chris ODowd makes a welcome cameo as a blind date for a very reluctant Jane. The tone is far more amiable on Earth (London to be specific the site of the final showdown) than in Asgard where Anthony Hopkins Renee Russo and Idris Elba remain locked in golden-hued majesty. Hemsworth a seemingly perfectly rendered movie star equipped with brawn and baritone also suffers from the stiffness. He had much more fun in ""Rush"" earlier this year. Ardent fans (who should stay through the credits) will likely be satiated by the pleasing enough ""Thor The Dark World."" But perhaps at this point even diehards may wish for something more from a Marvel equation that often subtracts humanity.

By David Edelstein Published Nov 3 2013 ShareThis Lance Armstrong and director Alex Gibney.  (Photo Elizabeth Kreutz/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics) F.U. Lance Armstrong and the bike you rode in on. Sorry I had to get that off my chest. Now I can review Alex Gibneys engrossing documentary The Armstrong Lie in a more objective manner. I should add that many people at the preview screening were muttering their own variations of F.U. Lance Armstrong though it didnt feel cathartic. There was too much free-floating creepiness. Gibney spent most of his time with his subject during the 2009 Tour de France comeback when Armstrong was still lying his ass-face off. As an embarrassingly obvious liar I am constantly fascinated by how others do it and Gibney gives you many opportunities to study a master. The tell I think is that Armstrongs face freezes and his eyes go dead when he says he has never doped. But then his face often freezes and his eyes go dead in normal conversation. Which means hes usually lying which meansand I believe that Gibney intends to demonstrate thisthat truth for Armstrong is relative and that what we call Lie-Land he calls home. And home is where he hangs his hatbut never his head. Gibney puts himself at the center of the doc which is unusual. In voice-over he says he began shooting in 2009 and was more or less in bed with Lance. He was there to document Armstrongs return to cycling after beating testicular cancer and the would-be amazin victory that ended badly for our protagonist with Alberto Contador giving Lance a long Eat my dust look across his handlebars and showing him his receding derriere. Gibney would have mentioned the controversies of course. He could hardly have left out the press conference in which Armstrong reams out Paul Kimmage for writing that the cancer had returned to cycling meaning Armstrong. You are not worth the chair youre sitting on says Armstrong looking Kimmage in the eye. And you can sympathize a little with his umbrage Kimmage was hitting below the belt of a man who is presumably still tender down thereas well as justly proud of the hundreds of millions he has generated for sick children. The sympathy evaporates though when Gibney considers the hundreds of millions he generated for himself and a whole sleazy cabal that reached all the way to the upper administrative echelons of the sportwhile simultaneously helping to ostracize cyclists he taught how to dope in the first place. Anyway Gibney put that 2009 footage aside until professional cycling was suddenly shocked shocked by evidence of Armstrongs doping and stripped him of his seven titleswhereupon Lance came semi-clean to Oprah who has difficulty asking follow-up questions of people nearly as rich as she is. The Armstrong Lie jumps around in time. Now were in 2013 now 2009. Now were in the nineties watching Lances rise from a fatherless Texas hothead to a smoothie whod ride away with the big titles and then home to Sheryl Crowwhile wise onlookers like David Walsh wrote that something smelled to heaven. The chronology is confusing at times but the film is never not fascinating. Im bound to admit that a skeletal post-cancer Armstrong getting back on his bike and slowly agonizingly into condition is more impressive than Rocky Balboa punching dead slabs of cow and that if athletic prowess were measured simply by the will to subject oneself to anything Armstrong is indeed a champion. Gibney also provides an educationif you want iton blood oxygen levels and their adjustment via dope and transfusions. Lances doctor was named Ferrari and if that wasnt a clue to why hed suddenly go so fast I dont know what is. Back to that lying. Professional sports is now a mountain of asterisksthe honest ones the ones who dont dope leave well below its peak their names unknown to usand Armstrong is its troll king. He can say I lied and still lie (the film strongly implies) about doping during the 2009 Tour. He can lie Im convinced because he fundamentally believes that his lies elevated him to a different sphere than the rest of us mortals and that he breathed the higher air. When he tells Gibney I can sleep at night hes not for once lying. Something is rotten in Asgard to which Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has returned with a vanquished but ever-sneering Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and where Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is throwing regular regal hissy fits. Perhaps Odin is troubled that his majestic realm is about to be overrun not so much by aliens as by a second-rate Tolkien plot that revolves around an empowering dark matter (the Aether) that attaches itself to of all people Natalie Portman as top Earth scientist Jane Foster. The computer-enhanced villain is called Malekitheven the name is genericand he wants to destroy the Nine Realms which means he first has to suck the Aether out of Nataliewho is given to passing out drifting into another dimension and emitting crackles of energy. I drifted off into the Aether myself while various CG armies whacked away at one another but Thor The Dark World gets a lot more entertaining in the second hour when the shape-shifting Loki is sprung from his cell (for complicated reasons) and immediately begins trading bitchy insults with his forthright manly brother. Many credited and (Im sure) uncredited screenwriters have come onboard to punch up the banter and add good deflating gags like Thor having to board the London tube (Mind the gap) in the middle of an epic battle. Thats the series comic signature and its a good one high-flown Asgard declarations followed by earthy put-downs. Sometimes the balance is off and the movie tilts into camp (Kat Dennings as Portmans high-strung assistant is an irritant) but when all is said and disintegrated it delivers. At these prices it better. You can be sure that in the Comic Con-claves of the Internet angry young men are even now debating the thorny issue of Thors kingship and why he doesnt want it and whether various minor Marvel characters have been given their due onscreen (obviously not). I wish them well. The rest of us can enjoy the ripe decor and luxuriant alienness of actors like Idris Elba and his great horned helmet. Hiddleston stole the first Thor picture but this time Hemsworth holds his own. Ive been guilty of underrating him; he no longer seems like an overdressed lifeguard but an actor at one with his mythic accoutrements and worthy of his hammer. His voice is a thing of beautybasso profundo with a rasp that adds an echo effect. He easily overpowers Hopkins whose perorations are flat and cadences overfamiliar. Modern superheroes have an ironic self-deprecating side whereas Hemsworth is a true Marvel. The Armstrong Lie Directed by Alex Gibney. Sony Pictures Classics. R.

Sure Captain America is the de facto leader but even he -- like the others -- is just a jacked-up human. Thor is a god. Or if not quite a god as he demurs hes the next best thing a flying titan with a 5000-year lifespan. How old is he now? Who knows. But if youve seen the trailer you know Im not the only one tempted to hack off a limb and count the rings. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Do the math and in Thor-years a mortal lives as long as a carnival goldfish. Which explains why hes befuddled when Earth girl Jane (Natalie Portman) slaps him for ditching her in New Mexico. To her the blond lug (Chris Hemsworth) has been MIA for two years. To him its just been a momentary pop-off while he you know fought the rest of space into submission. And to us its just a quick cheap giggle. Though Portman and Hemsworth are two perfect physical specimens they give off less heat than a dime-store lighter. Portman seems to be inwardly rolling her eyes that shes followed up her Oscar win with two roles thatve stuck her in a metal bra.No matter. Their miscast romance is just one cog in Thor The Dark World which is itself just one motor in the billion-dollar Marvel machine that will run tirelessly as long as each film is at minimum competent. The Dark World has the essentials -- four fights six quips and one Earth city reduced to rubble -- and it moves the franchise another furlong closer to 2015s Avengers 2.Film Details Thor The Dark World RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time120 min. More Info Trailer Instead of Kenneth Branaghs delightfully silly Shakespeare this Thor is helmed by TV director Alan Taylor of Game of Thrones. Thanks to The Avengers 1.5 billion global haul Taylor was clearly given a bigger checkbook. Thors astral home of Asgard is twinklier the Rainbow Bridge is rainbowier and the villains well are still just a bunch of grim-faced gray-and-black aliens -- havent we killed six kinds of them already? -- equipped with the Aether yet another raw element of destruction akin to the Tesseract. Youd think the universe would stop creating suicide weapons but then again this galaxy is so goofy its made of nine colorful circular worlds that every five millennia layer themselves like a Super Bowl dip.

Sep. 13 600pm As The Dark World -- so named for Svartalfheim the home of the Dark Elves -- starts the nine realms are due to align again that week. Whadda coincidence And so awakens the dread elf king Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) a fiend with white skin and coal-lump eyes like a skinny snowman who wants to reclaim the Aether and simultaneously smash every living thing to pieces which is a surprise only if you havent seen a comic book movie in the last six years. (Did it really take eight credited writers to come up with that shocker of a climax?) At least there are some nifty black-hole grenades which turn their victims inside out like a rolled-up sock before going poof.Hemsworths Thor is still big and blond and he makes a grand entrance. Here hes first seen thwomping his hammer against a rock monster while Wagnerian Valkyries shriek their excitement. He gets one half-decent nude scene for the ladies though nothing so lusty as in the first film when he silenced Portman just by passing shirtless through her apartment. But the sequel forces him to spend most of his time in space against golden CG vistas that leave him seeming puny. He fares better on Earth where Hemsworth can get laughs by being a Norse god in mundane apartments dutifully hanging his hammer on a coat rack. Torn between two worlds the character feels adrift in his own movie when hes the one Avenger who should be the most anchored -- hes certainly the only one with a full regiment of family and friends even if his younger brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) cant stop trying to kill everyone.Its impossible to imagine Tony Stark hanging out at a bar with his friends babies as Thor does here. And unlike the Iron Man flicks -- which for better and worse hum along solely on star Robert Downey Jr.s charisma -- Thors world is so crowded by naked scientists (Stellan Skarsgard) wisecracking babes (Kat Dennings) hard-fighting babes (Jaimie Alexander) imperious kings (Anthony Hopkins) and idiot interns (Jonathan Howard) that Thor himself can feel almost inessential. He even lets Bridesmaids charmer Chris ODowd steal two scenes as a schmuck trying to woo Portman. Minn Gud man.As Thor matures his ego shrinks along with his identity. Lacking Iron Mans wit the Hulks brains and the Captains ideals hes in peril of going poof himself if the franchise doesnt figure out how to capitalize on its most glorious hero. But theres one scene a Viking burial at the end of the world where The Dark World shows the emotional potential of the berserker beautiful Norse epic weve yet to see. Thor might not be immortal but hes the only Avenger with the operatic ambition to reach literally for the heavens.Follow VoiceFilmClubSubscribe to the Voice Film Club podcast1 Natalie Portman in Thor The Dark World.Photo by Jay Maidment Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

This is a deeply silly extremely noisy and sometimes impenetrable action movie thats drowning in CGI wild overacting and mullets. And its enormously entertaining.We pick up the story shortly after events in 2012s The Avengers hissable horned villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston) languishes in Asgards deepest dungeon; bulging hero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) battles to reunite the Nine Realms; and Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is in London studying dimensional anomalies and dating Richard (Chris ODowd). But its not long before an ancient enemy arises this time its the dark elves a gang of unpredictable intergalactic Tolkien re-enacters led by Christopher Eccleston in facepaint. Most of what worked in 2011s first Thor works again Hiddleston is campy and treacherous Hemsworth is puppy-dog keen and theres a nice line in knowing jokery clearly inspired by Joss Whedons script for The Avengers. But the first films shortcomings reappear too the realm of Asgard looks like a gold-plated chocolate-box nightmare Anthony Hopkins looks bored as uber-God Odin and Thors gang of forgettable divine sidekicks do little but get in the way. Its when the action gets going that The Dark World scores points over the original. This is a grander pacier film crammed with sprawling prog-rock landscapes masked elf armies and giant spaceships over Greenwich. And if the wormhole-hopping battle scenes do get a bit eye-frazzlingly and brain-bendingly convoluted the best advice is just to buckle up and go with it.

It relies heavily on CGI with obligatory hammers moving in and out to make you feel you got your moneys worth if you paid the extra for watching it in 3D. To that extent it looks great but the script is poor and the acting generally wooden. If you stay after the credits for the obligatory hint at the next film you will get a sense of impending doom as to how many more indentikit movies you will have to sit through to get to the end of the saga. I know it opened mid week to cash in on half term but the screening I was at was very sparsely attended for a Saturday. I might watch the next Captain America film but am highly unlikely to pay to see Thor 3. A middling two star just about OK film.

Early on in ""Thor The Dark World"" the latest slab of briskly amusing elaborately inconsequential 3D entertainment from the Disney/Marvel comicbook factory an evil Dark Elf announces his sinister plan to ""unleash the Aether."" What sounds at first like an arcane euphemism for breaking wind turns out to be just another way of stating what you probably already suspected The megalomaniac of the month is about to activate the latest all-powerful weapon capable of triggering mass annihilation necessitating yet another intervention by a popular superhero and his ragtag band of sidekicks. Still as helmed by Alan Taylor this robust impersonal visual-effects showpiece proves buoyant and unpretentious enough to offset its stew of otherwise derivative fantasy/action elements.This story first appeared in the October 29 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. The fact that much of the action plays out in Asgard and other far-flung dimensions makes for an enlivening change of scenery at the very least even if the films formula of destructive mayhem plus tongue-in-cheek humor remains pure essence of Marvel. Already expected to outpace 2011s Kenneth Branagh-helmed ""Thor"" when it begins its international rollout Oct. 30 (with a Stateside bow to follow Nov. 8) the Disney release should rep an even more conclusive test than ""Iron Man 3"" of ""The Avengers"" effect revealing just how massively Marvels individual franchise properties stand to capitalize on spillover success from that 2012 worldwide smash. An ancient prologue recalls the battle between the noble forces of Asgard and a wicked race known as the Dark Elves named less for their pale complexions than for their love of all-consuming darkness. But their dastardly plans are thwarted when they failed to detonate the Aether an ""ancient force of infinite destruction"" that resembles a mass of writhing red energy-tendrils or perhaps a plate of radioactive spaghetti. The surviving Dark Elves led by the supervillain Malekith (an unrecognizable Christopher Eccleston) are sentenced to centuries-long slumber while the Aether is buried deep down in a place where nobody would ever find it. Centuries later of course who should stumble upon it but Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) Earths most beautiful astrophysicist and the mortal soul mate of everyones favorite hunk with a hammer Thor (Chris Hemsworth). When her body unwittingly becomes the Aethers host making her the target of the newly revived Malekith Jane is spirited away to Asgard by Thor who is due to succeed his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) as king of the realm. But the coronation will have to wait given that the Dark Elves plot to activate the Aether could have devastating consequences for all Nine Realms. Earth as it happens is one of those Nine Realms although if ""Thor The Dark World"" is to be believed its such a tedious planet that its hard to feel any sorrow at the prospect of its destruction. (If only it seemed like more than an idle threat at this point.) Things turn leaden almost every time the film cuts to terra firma where Janes endlessly sarcastic friend/assistant Darcy (Kat Dennings) and new intern Ian (Jonathan Howard) try to figure out a scientific solution with the help of Janes old mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) who seems to have added crazed nudism to his list of eccentric hobbies. Fortunately the strained comedy and mundane visuals of the Earth scenes (all of them set in London where the film was largely shot) are rarely in evidence in Asgard and its largely a pleasure to spend time there with Thor and Jane who looks especially charming clad in the finery of the realm (courtesy of versatile costume designer Wendy Partridge). Its in this otherworldly kingdom -- variously influenced by Norse mythology brutalist architecture and Mandalay Bay -- that director Taylor delivers his most compelling setpieces starting with the Dark Elves deadly assault on Odins palace and culminating in a rather stunningly beautiful mass funeral sequence. Asgard too is where we again find Thors treacherous power-mad brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) now languishing in an underground prison after his role in the events of ""The Avengers."" Loki may be a known quantity by now for Marvel fans but hes rarely been more delectable company than he is here -- defeated bitterly sarcastic and utterly indifferent to either his own fate or Asgards imminent destruction. The brotherly enmity between him and Thor takes a genuinely intriguing turn when it becomes clear the two will have to join forces in order to stop Malekith a development that is wisely played for laughs as well as tense character drama. In the end that humorous approach is largely the films saving grace keeping the action sufficiently lively and diverting that audiences wont recognize how recycled the material is or how low the stakes feel. Disposable as it may feel at the end of the day ""Thor The Dark World"" is not without a certain pleasing deftness from its goofily offhand way of finding scientific explanations for blatantly supernatural phenomena to the blithe ease with which it sends its characters hopscotching from one dimension to the next. This latter motif succeeds in turning films climactic showdown into a playful exercise in physical displacement shot and edited with a bit more coherence than the typical f/x orgy of exploding buildings. And a few neat twists throughout hinge on the Asgardians talent for shapeshifting which functions here like the magical equivalent of characters peeling off latex masks a la ""Mission Impossible."" With no sins of hubris to overcome this time around Thor himself is a somewhat duller presence this time around through no fault of Hemsworths solid likable performance and stereoscopically enhanced pectorals. Portman makes a fine damsel in distress pausing every so often to frown down at meteorological gadgets or to flash her color-tinted contact lenses as the Aether burrows its way into her system. Rene Russos touching turn as Odins brave wife Frigga offers a welcome respite from all the brooding male tempers on display while Idris Elba somehow animates his largely inexpressive role as Heimdall the all-seeing guardian of Asgard. That there are not one but two obligatory teasers buried in the closing credits merely underscores the merrily-we-roll-along assembly line that Marvels movie output has become. Up next for the record ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" in 2014 followed by ""The Avengers Age of Ultron"" in 2015.

If they didnt many milennia old writers would not still be remembered today Reply Donald Watkins says November 16 2013 at 640 pm I enjoyed the way it opened with the epic scene of the Elves fighting in Mordor from the first Lord of the Rings movie (excellent reuse). I loved the scene at the Game of Thrones style Jedi training camp (energy swords and laser guns). Asgard was quite eye-catching with those brilliant changes that made it resemble a huge version of Rivendell. It really captured that new Star Wars look when those space ships zoomed through the city shooting everything with laser cannons. The inclusion of the Red Matter from JJ Abrams Star Trek was pretty cool as well. And Ill never forget the brilliance of having Jane use those ""quantum field generators"" from Star Trek to save everyone at the end. ...I actually did enjoy the movie and had a really good time. Reply Names Have Power says November 15 2013 at 137 pm WHAT IN THE NINE HELLS? I expect better from you people you really think this is a good movie? Just look at the effin villains Dark elves I refer you to any book movie show etc. dedicated to the drow elf race -- these are not dark elves. They look like orc rejects from the Lord of the Rings series ARRRGGGGHHH This is why a Drizzt movie should not be made; it just wouldnt be done right. Sorry for the ranting this just really irritates me. Maybe Ill watch it maybe I wont but right now Im thinking that the best thing to do is to just keep this movie as far away from me as possible. Fine by me; I have the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who to prepare for. Geronimo Reply DC says November 12 2013 at 237 am To me Thor is a corny ass character. Just another blonde hair blued eyed white guy here to save the day. He is way to easy to cast but thats Hollywood for you just get any muscle bound white guy with no acting talent to play the leading role cuz all the white girls will love him. The only reason I gave this film a chance is cuz of loki. Hiddleston was superb race aside he is a talented actor. Now i know what your gonna say Thor in the comics is a white. I know this but y be so stereotypical. Imagine if they casted a mexican or polynesian Thor anybody that can act lmao. What if he was black? Come on Hollywood I know there is a young muscle bound good looking black guy (thats not named Denzel or Will Smith) who can act that you could find. Give other people a shot at these leading roles in these big productions. But Hollywood would never let a black guy be the love interest of Natalie Portman so dont worry white people lol. I just want Hollywood to change it up and stop being so predictable Reply One Above All says November 10 2013 at 226 am Critics hate the genre. It is only when the genre offers up social commentary that meets their presupposed assumptions of what the world should be taught does any ""critic"" like anything from this genre.

Reply Tommy D says November 8 2013 at 601 am Unsure as to how this Justin Chang fella (?) has been dubbed ""Chief Film Critic"" by Variety - his reviews are painfully flip smug annoying self-absorbed and all over the board blind deaf and dumb. At least the Hollywood Reporter usually tries to produce a genuinely honest review. Reply cinemaville says November 7 2013 at 607 am Be clear should we watch the movie or not? Enough of this mixed bag. Reply Mark says November 6 2013 at 301 pm All these comic book movies are starting to get a little old. Reply ojack says November 2 2013 at 1114 pm hey sure a super hero movie can be MORE than just a super hero movie. and when THAT happens like in the case of The Avengers and The Dark Knight..and (the non-comic book adaptation) pixars The Incredibles...theyre just the BEST kind of entertainment NO DOUBT. but when that doesnt happen and we just get A super hero movie then what else dya expect other than a hero a villain and a destructive/evil plan...?? Derivative unoriginal...heck dont go looking for that in this type of movies..look for FUN which WBs Man of Steel and the last Dark Knight flick FAILED to give...and youll have well fun at the movies. Thor 2s a fun and a better Thor movie than the first one...and way better than garbage like those Transformers movies... looking forward to MORE marvel movies. Reply jj says October 30 2013 at 853 am im ready for marvel movies to go away. Reply SL says November 13 2013 at 1039 am How about just dont go see them. Theyre obviously not your cup of tea. Dont deny the rest of us something we enjoy. Reply Keith says October 29 2013 at 637 am Aw you guys hes not one of us. But his opinions are pretty sound. Agree with yall though like Star Wars you go to these movies for a certain kind of entertainment. Other kinds-well heck pop in ""The English Patient"" and revel. Reply nan says October 25 2013 at 432 pm I never understand why someone who doesnt like a certain genre would bother to write a review for that type of movie. Marvel movies arent great art and they dont pretend to be. They make big bucks because theyre fun and people like to have fun. You can see other movies to get your culture fix. Reply moviegoer says October 25 2013 at 1214 pm Could this reviewer be any more pretentious? Its variety not the new yorker. Reply LOL says October 23 2013 at 111 pm This Chang guy always produces solid reviews. Zombies superheroes YA literature adaptations - America does love crap. Reply kenmandu says October 23 2013 at 900 am I thought the villain was the Dark Elvis-would be much more fun. Reply Marlene says October 23 2013 at 628 am Nice review. Reply Steve UK says October 23 2013 at 532 am Justin liked it more than the Hollywood Reporter reviewer who gave it a meh rating. Im looking forward to seeing Thor 2 in the next few weeks and all the other upcoming Marvel movies keep em coming. Reply Jim says October 22 2013 at 300 pm ""briskly amusing elaborately inconsequential arcane euphemism megalomaniac annihilation robust impersonal buoyant unpretentious derivative""...somebody likes their thesaurus a liiiiittle too much. Reply me says October 28 2013 at 429 pm Justin is always very impressed with himself (probably more so than any of his readers). As I felt compelled to tell him once the great Roger Ebert who won a Pulitzer never resorted to such tactics. And he was a lot more fun to read. Reply Tom Snide-ier says October 22 2013 at 444 pm So I take it you never made it past 6th grade? Got ya. Reply BC2010 says October 23 2013 at 525 am Yeah 7th graders (and you) talk like that all the time. Got ya. Nanny Mo says October 22 2013 at 227 pm Im ready to be done with Superheroes for about 10 years. Then Ill want to see them again. Its getting dull. How many times can they have a personal strength-and-values crisis only to find themselves back in their respective cabals good graces again? Its a lot of recycling. I think Marvel figured they were getting close to boredom so they sold to Disney just about the time Thor-ad-infinitim jumped his Aether er... shark. Reply E.V. says October 22 2013 at 209 pm They need to ease up on these comic book superhero movies otherwise theyll go the way of the Western like back in the 50s Reply Tom Snyder says October 22 2013 at 131 pm This review sounds a bit condescending. Maybe Justin should go back to giving over-the-top rear-smooching reviews to the latest ""edgy"" and ""avant garde"" but boring indie that the vast majority of moviegoers will pay no mind to at all both now and decades from now and forget because they are uninspired AND uninspiring Reply Tim says October 22 2013 at 624 pm Umm. Fanboy much? Get a life dude. His reviews are almost always fair and on-target. I rely on him and Dargis almost solely now that Eberts gone. Reply Tom Snide-ier says October 22 2013 at 155 pm Yawn. Sorry guy Justin reviews and loves/likes/hates films of all genres. Sounds like this is a ""slightly above average to good"" film. Get over yourself watch the film and make up your own mind. P.S. I really hope you are under 15 to be so immature. Reply See All 28 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Katie Couric Next Documentary Looks At Gender Revolution For...

""Thor The Dark World"" falls squarely into Entertaining Enough with plenty of excitement and panache to make it lots more fun than the first one. This time around we get no ticky-tacky small-town sets and director Alan Taylor (an HBO vet whose ""Game of Thrones"" credentials no doubt got him this gig) strikes just the right balance. That means we get swordplay here spaceships there here a self-deprecating inside joke there a moment of noble sacrifice everywhere a crash-bang-kaboom. E-I-E-I-O. Also read Carrie Review Stephen King Remake Is Bloody Irrelevant This sequel also doles out its supporting players in acceptable doses so we dont get too much of Kat Dennings snarky science assistant or Anthony Hopkins overblown Odin. The latter does provide one of the films sillier moments when he fulminates at the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston) ""Your only BIRTHRIGHT-AH Was to DIE-YEE"" While Loki returns to Asgard in chains for his misdeeds in the previous movie (and in ""The Avengers"" of course) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his cohorts are traversing the universe undoing Lokis damage and bringing order to the nine realms. Its hard work thats kept him away from Earth where scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is still trying to track down Thor. Its in that pursuit that she stumbles upon and winds up absorbing a lethal force known as the Aether which dark elf Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) tried to use 5000 years earlier to plunge the entire universe into darkness when the nine realms aligned perfectly. Wouldnt you know it alignment time is coming up and a newly-revived Malekith chases Jane and the Aether to Asgard and beyond in the hopes of finally accomplishing his sinister plan. Also read Captain Phillips Review Taut Suspense Iffy Racial Politics Unfussy Tom Hanks (Video) So while the story is pretty basic superhero stuff ""Thor The Dark World"" uses this familiar backdrop as a springboard for some interesting character moments. Screenwriters Christopher L. Yost Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely give us less of Thors lieutenants this time around but that allows for some witty asides from gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) and a show of backbone (and swordsmanship) from Asgardian queen Frigga (Rene Russo). Theres even room for some rope-a-dope and reversal from characters from whom wed least expect it; disappointingly however one of the films best twists gets undone in the films final moments for reasons that seem more corporate-driven than dramatic. (And when I say ""final moments"" I mean of the film proper not counting the two servings of post-credits ""shwarma"" for which audiences should definitely stick around.) Unlike so many of the current crop of big-screen heroes Thor doesnt really get to have much of a sense of humor or of self-doubt but Hemsworth manages to make this old-school square-jawed titan fun and relatable. Whether hes reuniting with Jane (after having been pining for her since the last movie) or tumbling through and atop some of Londons oldest and newest edifices this is a guy who knows how to hold our attention. Also read Thor The Dark Worlds Alan Taylor to Direct Next Terminator Movie Portman (with the help of the writers) is smart enough to make Jane integral and intelligent and not just The Girl and while Hiddleston never full-on chews the scenery in his third go-round as the treacherous Loki hes not above giving it a nibble or two. Best of all Chris ODowd pops in for two hilarious scenes as a would-be suitor of Janes without ever throwing off the films epic tone. ""Thor The Dark World"" delivers the goods -- action otherworldly grandiosity romance humor -- above and beyond its predecessor. That doesnt necessarily launch it into the pantheon of greatness but its at least a reassuring sign that the Marvel juggernaut is remaining firmly on the rails. Or the Rainbow Bridge. Whatever.
