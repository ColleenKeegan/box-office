Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In 1985 a homophobic Texan with AIDS becomes an unlikely hero for the gay community. Rated R (pervasive language some strong sexual content nudity and drug use) BOTTOM LINE A solid biopic is made transcendent by McConaughey who shed nearly 50 pounds and deserves to gain an Oscar for his ferocious funny performance. CAST Matthew McConaughey Jared Leto Jennifer Garner LENGTH 157 The last time most viewers saw Matthew McConaughey was in last years stripper comedy ""Magic Mike"" when he played a strutting slab of beef named coincidentally Dallas. Prepare yourself for a shock In the new biopic ""Dallas Buyers Club"" McConaughey has shed nearly 50 pounds to play a real-life AIDS victim. At something like a third of his normal weight (the 6-foot-tall actor reportedly plummeted to 135 pounds) McConaughey is almost literally a shadow of his former self. He is also twice the actor hes ever been delivering the performance of his career as Ron Woodroof a homophobic Texan diagnosed with HIV in 1985. This somewhat fictionalized version of Woodroof is a foul-mouthed sleazeball addicted to cocaine and bargain-priced women and McConaughey (a Texas native) throws himself into this vividly off-color role body and soul. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Late nights convention takes Who did it best? LIer preps for next Americas Got Talent Woodroof initially laughs off his 30-day life sentence. Like Denzel Washingtons Captain Whitaker in ""Flight"" hes seemingly unkillable a party-cockroach immune to all poisons. After several fainting spells however hes begging Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) for the then-breakthrough drug AZT. When he learns that other promising drugs are banned in the United States Woodroof sets about smuggling them in. All he needs are some customers. Enter Rayon (an excellent Jared Leto) a transgender woman who becomes Woodroofs unlikely business partner. Shes a fictional character a stand-in for an entire class of people that Woodroof initially abhors. What they share is a desire to live and Rayon a gay nightlife denizen with a heroin habit has the better Rolodex. The movies best moments are shared between these two outsiders who evolve from antagonists to co-workers to almost-married couple. A scene in which one of Woodroofs good-ol-buddies catches them bickering in the supermarket is nearly worth the ticket price. Directed with a bit of flair by Jean-Marc Valee from a well-crafted script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack ""Dallas Buyers Club"" mostly unfolds as a solid and straightforward biopic but McConaughey is so fierce and funny that he turns it into something transcendent. When hes on the screen the movie feels thrillingly alive. 300 MoviesDallas Buyers Club trailer PLOT In 1985 a homophobic Texan with AIDS becomes an unlikely hero for the gay community. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (pervasive language some strong sexual content nudity and drug use) CAST Matthew McConaughey Jared Leto Jennifer Garner LENGTH 157 BOTTOM LINE A solid biopic is made transcendent by McConaughey who shed nearly 50 pounds and deserves to gain an Oscar for his ferocious funny performance. ----- Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff McCONAUGHEY IS WAY MORE THAN ABS After a string of fluffy rom-coms (""Failure to Launch"" ""The Wedding Planner"") and mindless actioners (""Reign of Fire"" ""Sahara"") it was hard to regard Matthew McConaughey as more than prime Texas beef with a well-chiseled six-pack. But over the past two years hes become a darling of critics thanks to these complex performances.

BERNIE (2012) -- ""The actor wears the role of good ol boy-political opportunist as comfortably as the boots and Stetson"" the Los Angeles Times wrote of McConaugheys amusing turn as a showboating Texas DA in this black comedy. MAGIC MIKE (2012) -- McConaughey steals the show as the slick fast-talking owner of a club featuring male strippers.

Ron Woodroof (a shockingly thin Matthew McConaughey) hangs out at rodeos goes after the ladies two at a time and can be counted on to bust a gut when his pals tell homophobic jokes.So Woodroof is outraged when a blood test reveals that hes infected with the HIV virus. And he gets even angrier when told that he has only 30 days to live -- an unsettling but realistic diagnosis given the time period the mid-1980s.Out of spite as much as desperation the self-styled cowboy sets out to prove the doctors wrong -- first by illegally getting his hands on a new but problematic drug called AZT then by smuggling anti-viral meds out of Mexico. Setting up a club to sell the meds Woodroof soon realizes hes not the ideal liaison to the gay community. So he enlists someone considerably better qualified Rayon (Jared Leto) a flirty transsexual whose struggle to survive echoes his own. Its not long before the unlikely business partners become best friends.At once a fascinating character study and a scathing indictment of the role of the medical-pharmaceutical complex in exacerbating the AIDS crisis the fact-based ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is one of the best films of the year. Working from a screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack director Jean-Marc Vallee (""The Young Victoria"") delivers a stylistically gritty film that might have been made during the era it depicts -- if not for the fact that Hollywood was notoriously slow to acknowledge the reality of AIDS. McConaughey is terrific as a man who refuses to let other people tell him how to live -- or die. But arguably Leto is even more impressive deftly sidestepping caricature to get to Rayons essence.This is the rare film that not only entertains but enlightens.What ""Dallas Buyers Club""  Three and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Content Language sexual content nudity drug use  Run time 157 Qamp;A Actor-rocker Jared Leto puts on a new face The star of ""My So-Called Life"" ends his five-year hiatus with AIDS drama ""Dallas Buyers Club.""

"Dallas Buyers Club (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Dallas Buyers Club (R) Matthew McConaugheys remarkable performance is the main attraction in this true story about a man diagnosed with AIDS in 1985. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/14/2013 Editor rating 3 The first moment you see Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club you cant help but wince The actor looks gaunt and skeletal his clothes hanging at odd angles from his body his face tight like a skull. Then he starts talking and you practically recoil from the screen. Hes a hateful mean-spirited creep. McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof a good-ol-boy Texan who was diagnosed with HIV in 1985 and given 30 days to live. At first Ron doesnt believe his doctors (Jennifer Garner and Denis OHare) because back then everyone knew the virus was something only ""queers"" like Rock Hudson got. He continues partying with hookers and drugs weakening his immune system even further until he develops AIDS. But Ron wont go down quietly. First he bribes a hospital janitor to slip him a supply of AZT the first (and at the time only) medication being trial-tested by the FDA. But his condition worsens. Then he goes to Mexico where an exiled American physician (Griffin Dunne) tells him AZT is poisonous and suggests a cocktail of vitamins and fatty acids instead. The new treatment seems to stabilize Ron Hes feeling better. It also gives him the idea to start importing the meds over the border in bulk and selling them to other AIDS patients creating a ""buyers club"" with a 400 enrollment fee. Dallas Buyers Club was written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack inspired by an article that appeared in The Dallas Morning News in 1992 while Woodroof was still alive. The project had kicked around Hollywood since then circled by various big-name actors (including Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling). But financing always fell through until McConaughey committed to getting it made. You can see what drew the actor to the role Ron is the antithesis of practically every character the actor has ever played often deeply unlikable selfish racist homophobic and all-around jerk. McConaughey lost 38 pounds for the film and he also got rid of all his charisma too. Director Jean-Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y. Cafe de Flore) doesnt try to soften the characters edges or find a hidden nugget of humanity in him. Instead we come to understand Ron gradually the same way he comes to gain compassion and respect for other people no matter their sexual orientation. Unrecognizable under full drag Jared Leto plays Rayon a transsexual and fellow AIDS patient who becomes Rons business partner. The movie treats their relationship without sentimentality or treacle. Rayon is playfully flirtatious knowing how uncomfortable it makes Ron (hes the sole ray of comedy in a fairly grim film). As their business thrives so does the number of people living with AIDS. But their success gets the attention of the government and big pharmaceutical companies who were poised to make a fortune if AZT was approved. Dallas Buyers Club is on one level a fascinating dramatization of small businesses versus large corporations and how difficult survival can be for the little guy without deep pockets. But the movie ultimately rests on McConaugheys able emaciated shoulders who never once plays to the audiences sympathies. This is a straight-up portrait of a man who figured out a way to cling to life longer than anyone expected and in the process learned to let the world in.

As a rodeo clown lures a beast away from a just-pitched cowboy randy Ron Woodroof peers through the slats of a pen while riding a concho-belted floozy. Its 1985 and Woodroof an electrician and sometime rodeo cowboy is a man of appetites (some illicit) and opinions (many of them bigoted). When the real-life Woodroof went into the hospital with a hacking cough and nearly nonexistent T-cell count he was diagnosed with AIDS and given 30 days to live. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is the story of what he did with the extra 2457 days he fought for. And it was a fight Woodroff was abandoned by his former like-minded friends. He was thwarted by a medical establishment that had not yet made AZT the promising (and toxic) anti-viral drug available to those with HIV/AIDS at the time. ""Buyers Club"" refers to groups that purchased non-Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and supplements to provide to people with HIV/AIDS. While ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is foremost a portrait of one mans transformation it is also a visceral account of a highly charged time in the story of AIDS in the U.S. Played with raw rattling fury and grace by Matthew McConaughey Woodroof is a tarnished protagonist of the first order. Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee directs this fact-based drama with an intimate visual style -- both rough and polished -- that avoids docudrama clumsiness. McConaugheys vivid portrayal is complemented by the return of Jared Leto to the big screen. Frontman for the band 30 Seconds to Mars Leto plays transgender character Rayon. They meet prickly in a Dallas hospital where Dr. Eve Sacks (Jennifer Garner) is in charge of their care. Ron and Rayon forge a well-suited partnership in gray-market treatments. Rons got drive and the will to bend laws. Rayons got connections to the gay community. Screenwriters Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack work to depict Woodroof in all his less-than-glorious bigotry most of it homophobic. What the filmmakers seem more cowed by is sex. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" tries a tad too hard to show that as soon as Woodroof learns hes HIV positive he avoids having unsafe sex. Though this restraint leads to one of the grimmer laughs in the film its also hard to buy given the hard-drinking powder-snorting participant in threesomes theyve taken care to introduce us to. But this is a minor quibble about a moving achievement with deeply embodied performances. Woodroofs tale is one of hustling and self-preservation but also connection. The cast is solid sympathetic. Few are vilified not Rons scared and bigoted friend T.J. (Kevin Rankin) or FDA agent Barkley (Michael ONeill). But it is Ron and Rayons two-step of machismo and vulnerability and McConaughey and Letos shattering commitment to that dance that makes this story real rending and triumphant.

Starring Matthew McConaughey Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto. Directed by Jean-Marc Valle. (Rated R. 117 minutes.) In the first scene of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" we see a man riding a bucking bronco while off in the shadows in another part of the rodeo a man and a woman are having some very quick impersonal sex. The irony of the moment is that its not the cowboy getting tossed and thrown around the ring who is engaging in the more dangerous activity. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is the true story of Ron Woodroof an electrician and rodeo enthusiast who was so contrary so shady and so uncooperative that he figured out a way to live seven years with AIDS despite being told he only had a month to live in 1985. He was not the nicest guy. A ladies man a borderline drunkard and a complete homophobe he did everything he could to stay alive - and ended up helping a lot of other people in the process. A role to kill for Its a role that an actor would kill for and for Matthew McConaughey it marks the culmination of two solid years of smart choices and good films. Just a few years ago he was known for taking off his shirt in silly romantic comedies. Then came ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" ""Bernie"" ""Killer Joe"" ""Mud"" and ""Magic Mike"" and McConaughey transformed into someone whose name on a picture meant quality. Yet all that was just a buildup for this. His physical transformation in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is dramatic in itself. If Woodroof really looked the way McConaughey does here - and photos indicate that he did - one wonders how he didnt go running to a doctor months earlier. McConaughey is so skinny that his head looks small. He looks like his thick hair and mustache are sucking all the nutrients from his face. He has that awful look so reminiscent of AIDS in the 1980s of age grafted onto youth where the body is thin and creaky and the face is hollowed out and sallow and yet the eyes staring out are young. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" takes audiences back to the worst of the AIDS crisis where the disease was a death sentence and the publics terror and hostility were at its height. When Ron finds out that he has AIDS his first impulse is to deny it and to threaten the doctor (Dennis OKeefe) who asks whether he has ""engaged in homosexual activity."" He storms out determined to maintain his old life - of sex parties drugs and drinking - but within days McConaughey shows us the lonely and dumbfounded look of a man who has made the dread transition from the land of the well to the land of the sick. At first Ron schemes to get AZT an experimental treatment and the only one approved at the time. Soon he is going over the border from Texas into Mexico to get other less-toxic drugs and seeing a way to make a buck and stay alive at the same time he starts bringing them into the United States. Jared Leto plays Rayon a transsexual who becomes Rons liaison to the gay market; that is to the people most interested in AIDS drugs. Moral awakening Audiences glory in the partnerships of opposites because it makes us feel that all bridges can be crossed and anything is possible. As played by McConaughey Ron remains a harsh and lowdown man interested mostly in money and a good time and neither he nor director Jean-Marc Valle overplays Rons awakening moral sense. There are no corny close-ups indicating some internal realization. We just infer the change from his actions - for example in his minor but palpable shift from disdain to irritated concern in his dealings with Rayon who whether Ron knows it or not is the best friend hes got. As for Leto he takes a role that is physically flamboyant and doesnt get seduced by that. Rather he inhabits the characters internal life all the secrets and contradictions - Rayons mix of garishness and delicacy grandeur and self-loathing gallantry and despair - and the result is something deep and lovely. Not that it matters but it turns out that Rayon is a creation of the filmmakers and so is the impossibly sweet doctor played by Jennifer Garner. Perhaps the real-life history did need an intervention. The limits of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" are the limits most true stories come up against which are the facts. A good story lands and reverberates. In real life stories have a way of just stopping and leaving you a bit unsatisfied. The latter is what happens in this movie but perhaps that couldnt be avoided.

"Dallas Buyers Club 4.5 stars Article Things to do >> Movies >> Article Dallas Buyers Club 4.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED VIDEO ""Dallas Buyers Club"" trailer By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Nov 7 2013 429 PM The little guy standing up to the system is a pretty standard story in Hollywood as is the one about the bigot learning lifes lessons and coming around to acceptance. These elements are part of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" but Jean-Marc Vallees film is anything but standard thanks to an astonishing performance by Matthew McConaughey. Its a triumph another in a string of strong performances from the guy who looked for a while like he might be remembered for bad romantic comedies and getting busted for playing the bongos naked. No longer. Hes terrific here even better than he has been in recent roles in ""Mud"" and ""Magic Mike."" This feels less like the resurrection of a struggling career and more like an actor finding himself testing his boundaries and pushing past them with abandon. McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof based on a real-life electrician and rodeo hanger-on living in Texas in 1985. Woodruff also is a racist a homophobe a hard partier and as the film begins alarmingly skinny with a cough he cant shake. (McConaughey reportedly lost 47 pounds for the movie.) An accident lands him in the hospital where he learns from a doctor that not only is he HIV-positive he has AIDS. Woodroof whos straight takes the news about as youd expect By screaming homophobic rants at his doctors while denying their diagnosis. They tell him he has 30 days to live. Maybe. He responds that nothing can kill Ron Woodroof in 30 days. In 1985 that seemed like a ludicrous statement with no known cure for the disease. But soon Woodruff starts investigating AIDS and its treatments with the same gusto he formerly spent doing drugs and bedding rodeo groupies (the more the merrier). Meanwhile his friends desert him with the same acid put-downs Woodroof once favored himself. The disdain and cruelty with which gay people are treated is a shock its accuracy a shameful reminder. The hospital where Woodroof was diagnosed is starting human trials for AZT but he cant get in on them. So he buys the drug from an orderly and gobbles it like candy. The toxicity takes its toll and he winds up back in the hospital where he meets Rayon (Jared Leto also fantastic) a transgendered woman who also has AIDS. As is his custom Woodroof treats her with disdain but once she wins money from him in a card game he keeps his mouth mostly shut. The disease is killing him but his doctor Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) tells Woodroof that his self-medicating will do the job even faster. Undaunted he bolts (he has no use for hospitals) and winds up in Mexico where a disgraced doctor (Griffin Dunne) who rails against AZT has concocted a cocktail of drugs along with vitamins and supplements that he claims will help. Woodroof goes all in. Not only does he start the regimen he begins selling it to others who have AIDS. Of course the DEA and IRS frown on this sort of thing so Woodroof creates the buyers club of the title You get the drugs free but have to pay a monthly membership fee. Rayon comes aboard as his partner. Vallee working from a script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack infuses the film with some humor -- Woodroofs posing as a priest as he smuggles drugs from Mexico is a hoot -- but he never lets us forget that the stakes are deadly serious. Nor does McConaughey. That Woodroof becomes a hero of sorts isnt due to Hollywood manipulation of character or fairy-tale transformation. Its due to desperation. Woodroof wants to live. And he will do anything take any chance join in with anyone to make that happen. McConaughey captures that and then some in what easily is one of the best performances of the year.

Jennifer Garner gives the best performance of her career. She should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress. It is widely believed that the Academy was sympathetic to McConaughey and Leto because the Academy usually favors actors who play people who are terminally ill (Tom Hanks in ""Philadelphia"" for example.) or are handicapped. However they both gave excellent performances and were deserving of their awards. Its alittle formulaic (The little guy going up against the big evil government that seems unstoppable.) however ""Dallas Buyers Club"" works on every level. An excellent movie.

Cathy Kanavy/Bleecker Street Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday November 7 2013 Follow AnnHornaday There was a time not so very long ago when Matthew McConaughey was on the verge of becoming a punch line if not a cautionary tale an erstwhile new-thing-on-the-block who squandered early hype and promise on naked escapades involving bongo drums and ill-advised romantic comedies. The actor who turned heads in a scene-stealing cameo in ""Dazed and Confused"" then succumbed to pathologically publicity-savvy packaging in his ""serious"" screen debut in ""A Time to Kill"" had somehow wound up making ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past."" A couple of years ago though McConaughey regained his footing returning to the very instincts -- part old-soul part gonzo -- that got him to the big show in the first place. With films like ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" (see it if you havent) ""Bernie"" ""Killer Joe"" ""Magic Mike"" ""The Paperboy"" and this years sublime coming-of-age drama ""Mud"" McConaughey claimed his rightful place in Americas dark heart a snaky sinewy shape-shifter whose anti-heroics even at their sleaziest possessed an almost pastoral purity and innocence. McConaughey has doubled down on the persona in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" an alternately wrenching and exuberant fact-based drama for which he famously shed nearly 40 pounds to play an emaciated HIV patient. As Texas electrician Ron Woodroof McConaughey delivers the performance of his career characterized not just by an astonishing physical transformation but by a wellspring of deep compassion and fearlessness. Together with co-star Jared Leto -- whose facial and corporeal transformation is every bit as startling -- McConaughey personifies the kind of blazing all-in commitment that defines screen acting at its simplest and its best. From its very first scene ""Dallas Buyers Club"" announces what kind of tough even tawdry world it intends to inhabit At a rodeo where cowboys are hurled into the ground like yard darts Woodroof embarks on a wild panting assignation of his own in the form of a furtive sexual encounter with two women in a stall just outside the ring. The year is 1985 and the gaunt stringy Woodroof is leading the life of a large-livin good old boy whose drinking gambling and hard partying eventually catch up with him in the form of a flu he cant shake. Except it isnt flu and the scene in which Woodroof learns from physician Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) that he has contracted the AIDS virus is just the first of several in which McConaughey exhibits uncanny powers of expression spontaneity control and restraint. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is nominally about Woodroofs simultaneous efforts to overcome social stigma and buck the medical establishment and bring non-FDA approved treatments to desperate patients. But really the movie is about choices in this case a protagonists unspoken evolution from homophobia to a begrudging vaguely haunted humanism; an actors decision not to compulsively seek the audiences love and approval; and a filmmakers decision to keep what might have become a saccharine parable of uplift on a harder riskier edge. Director Jean-Marc Vallee keeps ""Dallas Buyers Club"" real by rejecting high gloss in favor of a more spare stripped-down visual style; reportedly he used only natural light to film which keeps the often seedy subculture that Woodroof inhabits from becoming too cozy. But if that world -- of trailer-park orgies and cheap motels drug addicts and hookers -- isnt all sweetness and light it isnt devoid of heart. The soft vulnerable soul of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a transsexual named Rayon (Leto) a misfit and fellow AIDS patient whom Woodroof initially spurns but who eventually becomes his business partner. As a rousing reality-inspired tale of someone sticking it to The Man as well as a sober social history and sentimental chronicle of unlikely friendship and love ""Dallas Buyers Club"" could have gone wrong in myriad ways most of them having to do either with overkill or pompous self-seriousness. But Vallee working with a lean lively script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack neatly avoids excess letting Woodroofs terrific yarn stand on its own and getting out of the way of his extraordinary actors who channel the story without condescension or manipulative cheats. McConaughey and Leto may have the showiest roles but Garner deserves equal praise for her sensitive straightforward performance. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" never allows viewers to forget that its taking place within an epidemic of staggeringly tragic proportions. But neither does it allow that grievous context to negate the energy and sheer entertainment value of Woodroofs gutsy journey across the high wire between certain death survival and redemption. Thanks to a wily coyote of a protagonist -- and the actor who has made such characters such gratifying cinematic figures of late -- ""Dallas Buyers Club"" turns the facts of a life into deeply grounded emotional truth. McConaughey hasnt just become the devil we know. Hes become the one we love.     R. At area theaters.

Grade A A heterosexual roughneck becomes an unlikely hero to the AIDS underground in this buoyant fact-inspired movie. It does more to revive the Old West outlaw ethos than any cowboy film of the last 20 years. Director Jean-Marc Vallee and screenwriters Craig Borten and Melissa Wallack have crafted a fearless affecting drama that goes for the throat without losing its head. More than any other release so far this year ""The Dallas Buyers Club"" is an actors picture. Matthew McConaughey brings a rip-roaring combination of uninhibited redneck vitality and slowly developing sensitivity to the role of Ron Woodroof a Texas electrician rodeo rider and gambler. Woodroof takes matters into his own hands when hes diagnosed HIV-positive and given 30 days to live. Its 1985 - he cant see any credible disease-fighting process in place or even in sight. At a strip club he pays a hospital janitor to get him the experimental AIDS drug AZT. When that supply line stops he visits a renegade clinician in Mexico (Dr. Vass played with weary warmth by Griffin Dunne). Vass contends that AZT in its 85 dosage would kill more patients than it saves. Woodroof becomes a true believer in Vass regimen of vitamins minerals and cutting-edge pharmaceuticals such as Peptide T (which treats his AIDS-related dementia). He starts to feel his gamblers oats return as soon as he gets back some of his strength. He decides he can make a new life distributing Vass medical cocktails in Dallas. McConaugheys metamorphosis is uncanny. The writer Bill Minutaglio in his 1992 Dallas Life magazine article ""Buying Time"" describes Woodroof as ""a foul-mouthed outlaw who is as wiry as an ocotillo."" Thats McConaughey to a T. He ruthlessly alters his physique and personality subtly evoking his characters expanding spirit. His performance is extraordinary. When Woodroof places bad bets and tomcats around like a thoughtless reckless son of a gun McConaughey gives him a guttural tone and goading edge unlike anything the actor has done before. We understand that Woodroofs animal survival instincts and eagerness to strike out on his own compel him to find unique ways to confront his problem. Its the characters extended growth spurt - from Woodroof the wastrel to Woodroof the activist - that makes the film a voyage of discovery. Woodroofs snappy gait conveys his newfound pride in being clear and clean. And McConaughey funnels the mans contempt for authority into slick aggressive salesmanship and advocacy. Even more surprising when Woodroof looks into the mirror he can crack a radiant smile. Its Woodroofs reluctant friendship with a drug-addicted drag queen named Rayon - played by the equally astonishing Jared Leto - that broadens him as a person and enables him to sustain a business based on goodwill within an embattled and endangered subculture. Woodroof is still an unrepentant homophobe when he asks his one-time hospital roommate Rayon if she can bring him a score of customers. Soon after they gain a steady client base Woodroof and Rayon establish The Dallas Buyers Club. In exchange for membership fees the Club smuggles drugs not approved by the FDA tests them for purity then distributes them to participants -- those diagnosed with HIV who cant abide the slowness and complacency of the official response to the epidemic. ""The Dallas Buyers Club"" is a galvanizing story of a limited self-taught man taking responsibility for his own life and for each pill or morsel of food that goes into his body. He devises an entrepreneurial fix for his dilemma that ends up helping hundreds or thousands of others. ""The Dallas Buyers Club"" would be nothing else if it werent first of all (and maybe most of all) a coruscating character study. Woodroof is a primal guy who refuses to accept anyone elses judgment about matters of life or death He will not buy the idea that he should give up the battle and let doctors merely ease his pain. He believes in the evidence before his eyes and puts his own hide on the line to help pioneer effective AIDS protocols. In the pre-digital 80s he burns up microfiche machines phone lines and travel miles to investigate and procure avant-garde medicine and will pose as a priest or a high-rolling medical businessman to con a border guard or close a sale. McConaughey not only loses pounds of muscle but also any bit of excess or residual affectation in his acting style. He gives a remarkably open-minded openhearted performance. At the beginning Woodroof is the kind of not-so-great good ol boy who will abuse drugs exploit groupies and condemn Rock Hudson for being gay. Yet McConaughey lets us see his characters devastation when he considers HIV as both a death sentence and a stain on what he thought were his core values. (His drinking buddies abhor him; neighbors paint anti-gay curses on his trailer.) At the turning point when his AZT stash runs out Woodroof releases a bone-shattering cry of rage frustration and despair. But then McConaughey summons the end-of-the-tether exuberance that results from having nothing left to lose. His character takes a big jump forward when he agrees to cut Rayon in on his setup complete with 25 percent of the action. Even if he condemns the drag queens way of life he responds to the stubborn humanity within Rayon. Watching Jared Leto in the role you think who wouldnt? Leto matches McConaugheys ferocity with cutting sardonic wit and heart-shriveling tenderness. Rayon who cant clean up her act no matter how hard Woodroof pushes her to get off drugs and eat healthy food has her own source of courage - devotion to personal style. (She insists that shell look gorgeous when she meets God.) When she dons mens clothing to ask her banker father for money to help Ron its volcanically moving to hear her say she must repay a man who has been kind to her. She sees what others dont see in Woodroof and hes determined to live up to her vision of him. The movie views the FDA as bad guys though Minutaglios article states that the agency ""allowed the underground clubs unprecedented leeway"" for years. The mass audiences representative in the action is Jennifer Garners Dr. Eve Saks who manages to bite her tongue when her hospital bosses accept potentially injurious AZT trials - until she sees her patients doing better in the Buyers Club. Garner creates a smart tough character. She conjures a hard-hitting sympathy as this conventional woman evolves out of medical orthodoxy and embraces finding cures by any means necessary. Along with McConaughey Leto and a dynamite ensemble she injects a thoughtful complicated consciousness straight into the center of this heartbreaking story.

For these Dallasites AIDS no longer the fatal condition portrayed in Dallas Buyers Club The real story behind the Dallas Buyers Club movie For McConaughey Buyers Club transformation wasnt just physical Chris Vognar Matthew McConaugheys 5 best performances Beyond Dallas Buyers Club More local AIDS stories worthy of film Dallas Buyers Club starts with a group of mid-1980s rodeo rednecks profanely mocking AIDS and the recent death of Rock Hudson. Soon their leader Dallas Ron Woodroof has ceased laughing. Hes diagnosed HIV-positive ""You have 30 days to get your affairs in order."" In other words get ready to die.Buyers Club featuring yet another career-transforming performance from Matthew McConaughey tells the story of a guy who wasnt about to go gentle into that good night. More important the movie based on a true story shows how empathy has the power to destroy intolerance where it stands.Theres nothing Pollyanna about Woodroofs metamorphosis from wild-eyed party animal to defiant survivor to advocate for those he once categorically despised. McConaughey and the filmmakers know better than to give Woodroof a big come-to-Jesus moment. He sees what he can do to forestall his death (smuggle in drugs that havent been approved by the FDA) recognizes an opportunity to make some cash and realizes he can also help other AIDS patients. Proximity to those patients shows him that gay people are as human he is.Thats one of the story threads Woodroofs road to tolerance facilitated by his business partnership with the transgender Rayon (Jared Leto matching McConaughey step for step). The other thread follows Woodroof on his treks from country to country as he charms doctors into meeting his pharmaceutical needs. Those threads get a little tangled as Dallas Buyers Club tries to decide which story gets pride of place. But whenever that happens McConaughey and Leto are there to bring back the focus and liven up the whole thing.McConaughey plays Woodroof as a rangy loose-limbed roughneck with a half-pint bottle of whiskey always at the ready. Even at Woodroofs most frail state -- McConaughey slimmed down to scary proportions for the role -- the eyes convey an unmistakable message Dont mess with this guy. Leto avoids all drag-queen cliches and turns Rayon into a shrewd sensitive operator with a self-destructive streak. Their initial moments together as they square off in a hospital card game set the caustic tone for their relationship. As that relationship deepens the movie follows suit.Director Jean-Marc Vallee has a knack for moments of grimy lyricism and a feel for how editing can depict sudden memories and shifts of psyche. What he doesnt have the city of Dallas as a setting. One scene finds Woodroof driving down the highway with a green-screened not-so-subtly blurred skyline filling his windshield. If you havent been to (or lived in) Dallas you might not care but the finished product could have been filmed anywhere. (In fact it was shot in New Orleans where countless productions flock to take advantage of Louisianas generous tax-incentive program.)Dallas Buyers Club suffers from a lack of place. But it still captures a specific time when AIDS was a relatively new terror approved treatments were priced through the roof and both panic and ignorance filled the general populace. Its an unlikely heros journey that feels both radical and traditional. Personal growth never really goes out of style especially not when it has the power to keep others alive.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.DALLAS BUYERS CLUBB+ Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee.

AP AP AP AP AP AP Dallas Buyers Club Director Jean-Marc Vallee Cast Matthew McConaughey Jennifer Garner Jared Leto Rated R (pervasive language some strong sexual content nudity and drug use) Running time 117 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1207am on Friday Nov. 08 2013 Friday Nov. 08 2013 Friday Nov. 08 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Matthew McConaughey just keeps getting better and better turning in performances -- in such films as Mud and Killer Joe -- that are layered and powerful while portraying characters who are resolutely of a particular time and place. But he might find it hard to top himself after Dallas Buyers Club the flawed but moving drama based on a true story from the 80s about a North Texas man battling both AIDS and the government.McConaughey is Ron Woodroof an electrician amateur rodeo rider and Dallas ladies man whose love-em-and-leave-em lifestyle with just about every woman in town leaves him with AIDS and not long to live. At first the intensely homophobic Woodroof cant accept the diagnosis and once he does he refuses to believe that the government will only allow him to take AZT the sole FDA-approved drug at the time but one that doesnt help him at all.In a fit of desperation tinged with entrepreneurial zeal Woodroof begins clandestinely bringing in other drugs and remedies from Mexico and selling them to other AIDS patients. With the help of his doctor Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) and cross-dressing Rayon (Jared Leto) a fellow patient from one of his hospital stays Woodroof sets up the Dallas Buyers Club one of many such clubs that were springing up around the country at the time.McConaughey plays Woodroof with just the right amount of both the confidence born from years of having things his way and the vulnerability that must have come with what at the time was a death sentence. The latter is underscored by McConaugheys dropping some 40 pounds for the role turning himself into the skeletal embodiment of illness and imminent death.Similarly Leto -- who shed 30 pounds to play Rayon -- transforms himself and though his performance is eclipsed by McConaugheys its almost equally affecting.McConaughey and Leto both of whom may get Oscar nominations for actor and supporting actor respectively are so good that they almost mask the movies problems. French-Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee ( The Young Victoria) working from a script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack telescopes this era of the AIDS crisis into a very viewer-friendly good guys (Woodroof Rayon) vs. bad guys (FDA hospital doctors) when the truth probably has more shades of gray.On top of that the 80s Dallas that this movie portrays feels wrong like some outsiders dim view of what Dallas must have been like. The 80s was the era of prime Dallas swagger of the first-generation J.R. Ewing the Silicon Prairie the crash-and-burn savings-and-loan scandal and the swinging Starck Club all of which would have been the cultural background noise for Woodroofs life. (Woodroof lived in Oak Lawn the heart of Dallas gay community so it wasnt as if he were out in the burbs.)But the Dallas of Dallas Buyers Club which was shot in Shreveport feels like a small backwater a place where every time a cop shows up its the same guy (Steve Zahn).Still the simplistic Dallas Buyers Club is worth seeing if for no other reason than McConaugheys transformative and touching performance. The only question now is what he does for an encore.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Dallas Buyers Club"" a dramatized biography of the 1980s unlikeliest AIDS activist grabs the bull by the horns in the first shots. Gay-hatin bronc-ridin Texas good ol boy Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is in a rodeo arena cattle stall consorting with a pair of willing women while in the ring a cowboy is being tossed and gored by his bull. Its a sequence of visceral animal power and the key to Woodroofs ornery character. When hes diagnosed with AIDS he says the hospital must have mixed up his file with ""some daisy pullers."" When his homophobic buddies shun him after learning of his illness he literally spits at them. Relentlessly promiscuous druggy and short-tempered he is not an easy guy to like. But hes not going down without a fight. This is the performance of McConaugheys newly resurgent career. Its not just the showy physical transformation he pulled off losing 50 pounds to play the emaciated Woodroof. The key to his enjoyably unhinged work here is the delicate balance he maintains between Woodroofs desperation and his greed anarchic humor and nerve anger and empathy. Theres not another actor working today who could play this bigoted admirable S.O.B. so well. He refuses to cut away Woodroofs sharp edges and fit him into the Hollywood box. Shortly after he hears his diagnosis theres a scene of Woodroof intently facing a bank of red lights. We think theyre a churchs votive candles until the camera pulls back to show us hes in a strip club. Woodroof an oilfield electrician and part-time rodeo cowboy got sick in 1985. He rejected his doctors diagnosis that he would be dead in a month and refused to become a guinea pig in the FDAs slow and cautious treatment trials. After a self-guided crash course in alternative therapies Woodroof bought unapproved but effective vitamins supplements and antivirals in Mexico. Because he saw money to be made Woodroof set up an underground ""buyers club"" in a cheesy motel selling HIV-positive people his experimental drug cocktail for 400 a month. As his international import missions became more complex he began impersonating priests and physicians at U.S. border checkpoints. His black-market approach earned the wrath of the feds the courts the medical establishment and big pharmaceutical companies. He also won the scorn of some gay activists because his aim was making money not remaking health policy. Still many consider his venture a key development in the history of combatting AIDS. Woodroofs illness didnt magically change his feelings toward gays. In his hospital ward he meets and instinctively loathes a frail transvestite named Rayon (Jared Leto in the films second dazzling performance). Later Woodroof hires Rayon as his liaison to the gay community and only very gradually warms to her. dallas buyers club 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for pervasive language some strong sexual content nudity and drug use.  Theater Uptown. Rayon is crucial to his business success but irritates him by painting the motel room a gaudy shade of red -- or as Rayon calls it ""Cranberry Mocha"" Theres a funny scene of the ever-randy Woodroof who papers his office with cutout pictures from girlie mags realizing that hes been ogling a photo of Rayons boy-crush soft-featured glam rocker Marc Bolan. Over time the friendship blossoms into a grudging affection for his cross-dressing business partner. Theres a scene in a supermarket where one of Woodroofs old friends ridicules Rayon and Ron starts a clumsy scuffling fight with him. Leto smiles a sweetly charming Mona Lisa smile that lights up the screen. Its that tension between rowdy aggression and compassion that gives ""Dallas Buyers Club"" its special appeal. By showing us a roughneck battling like hell against death it paradoxically reaffirms what it means to be alive. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Dallas Buyers Club Share Comment Matthew McConaughey has seemed to be working up to something big lately and his role in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" could be it -- a Texas good old boy named Ron Woodroof who contracted HIV and became a hero of the alternative-medicine underground in the late 1980s. Its a choice part that seems tailored to the stars mischievous streak his newfound ambition and the expectations of Oscar-season uplift. The movies often touching and very watchable but what gets you past the scripts sincere calculation is the growing sense of rage toward a medical-industrial complex that saw AIDS sufferers as guinea pigs and sources of profit. With a terrific Jared Leto as the heros drag queen business partner and Jennifer Garner in the thankless (and fictionalized) role of their doctor. Mobile users unable to see the video click here.

"Dallas Buyers Club | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dallas-buyers-club ) Dallas Buyers Club (United States 2013) November 07 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Dallas Buyers Club tells the story of Ron Woodroof a raging heterosexual homophobe who over the course of several years in the mid-to-late 1980s was transformed by circumstances from a card-carrying bigot into a staunch gay rights activist. After contracting AIDS through unprotected (heterosexual) sex in 1985 Woodroof was given 30 days to live. By going outside the FDA-approved guidelines and taking medications that had not been cleared in the United States he managed to extend his life. (He died in 1992.) During that period he founded the ""Dallas Buyers Club"" an organization that gave away unapproved medications to its members. Through overseas contacts and by making drug runs into Mexico he was able to supply hundreds of desperate HIV+ men and women. He frequently ran afoul of law enforcement officials (although many of them turned a blind eye) was viewed with skepticism by many doctors and engaged in skirmishes with the FDA. As with many ""based on facts"" biographies considerable license is taken with the narrative of Woodroof who is played here in an eye-opening performance by Matthew McConaughey. The most compelling aspect of Dallas Buyers Club comes from watching the way the character develops from a macho redneck into someone who shows respect and affection for the gay men and women he interacts with on a daily basis. Another thing Dallas Buyers Club accomplishes is to recreate the AIDS-related climate of the mid-to-late 1980s when paranoia and misinformation about the disease was rampant and approved drugs to mitigate its effects were few and often ineffective. This was a time when the common misperception was that only homosexuals were vulnerable (thus the oft-heard phrase ""AIDS is Gods judgment against gays""). This belief is illustrated in the film when ladies man Woodruff is confronted by his buddies after word of his illness spreads. He is the recipient of hostility fear and homophobic actions. A secondary story element in Dallas Buyers Club relates to the antagonism between AIDS sufferers and the FDA and the frequently asserted allegation that when it comes to drug approval the government is in bed with the Big Pharmaceutical Companies. The film goes to great pains to emphasize how business concerns are as important to the decision of which drugs to approve as health care considerations. The Feds eventually clamp down on Woodroofs inventory even though none of the medications are hazardous (vitamins proteins) - they are merely not approved for the treatment of AIDS in the United States. In many ways the film is all about Matthew McConaughey and Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee is wise enough to train his focus on the actor. Looking like a gaunt version of porn actor Harry Reems McConaughey does some of the best acting of his career here submerging into the character. Over the past few years beginning with The Lincoln Lawyer and continuing through this years Mud McConaughey has worked diligently to re-invent his image and if there are any lingering questions about his range or ability Dallas Buyers Club removes them. The caliber of his performance not to mention his Christian Bale/The Machinist-style physical transformation (he lost 50 pounds) fulfills Oscar nomination criteria (although considering how crowded the field is its a crapshoot whether hell make the cut). McConaughey is supported by Jared Leto whose portrayal of transvestite Rayon is effectively realized even if his purpose is largely plot-related. Rayon exists as the means by which Woodroofs personality transformation/growth can be measured. The character is important although not three-dimensional. Jennifer Garner fills the seemingly obligatory part of the supportive doctor who takes as stand against the medical establishment. Theres nothing wrong with Garners performance but the character is largely superfluous. When it comes to finding an audience Dallas Buyers Club may have similar problems to those encountered by Milk no matter how dramatically compelling the material serious movies perceived as ""gay films"" rarely become box office standouts. Perhaps by focusing on a heterosexual lead there will be less resistance to see the movie among mainstream viewers. (Although one can make the comparison to films about racism that feature a ""white savior."") Regardless of who sees or doesnt see Dallas Buyers Club however the movie does what it sets out to do by providing a striking portrait of a remarkable character and offering a history lesson to those too young to remember how things were for AIDS sufferers during the dark ages of the 1980s.

I was more impressed by the larger story detailing the nationwide network of ""buyers clubs"" that distributed cutting-edge treatments to subscribers; however creaky this might be as drama its a fascinating look at an underground economy and the politics of medicine.

"Review Dallas Buyers Club finds McConaughey and Leto in top form - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Dallas Buyers Club finds McConaughey and Leto in top formBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 11/05/2013 120000 PM PSTUpdated 11/06/2013 043610 PM PST This Oct. 12 2013 photo shows actor Matthew McConaughey at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills Calif. McConaughey stars as Texan Ron Woodroof in the film ""Dallas Buyers Club"" which releases Friday Nov. 1 2013. To immerse himself in this role McConaughey read Woodroofs diary and listened to hours of taped conversations between Woodroof and Dallas Buyers Club screenwriter Craig Borten. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) (Chris Pizzello) Related StoriesNov 6Matthew McConaughey unabashed in Dallas Buyers ClubA few years ago speculating that actor Matthew McConaughey might one day become a critics darling would have seemed as ludicrous as suggesting that novelist Nicholas Sparks could bag a Pulitzer.Surprises happen.Today the promising tanned hunk who showed his range early on in ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""A Time to Kill"" before boxing himself in with such cardboard romantic comedies as ""Fools Gold"" and ""The Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" is basking in pre-Oscar buzz for his performance in ""The Dallas Buyers Club.""The talented Texan has been on a winning streak of late. He was outrageously showy as a shrewd stripper in ""Magic Mike"" then revealed reservoirs of depth as a lovelorn man on the run from the law in ""Mud."" While those performances re-established our faith in him as an actor its his role as Ron Woodroof in ""Buyers"" that will turn around the die-hard skeptics. Much has been made about McConaugheys drastic weight loss -- he shed nearly 40 pounds to play the real-life renegade drug supplier who was ravaged by AIDS. While theres no denying that his physical transformation is shocking its only one sign of his focused commitment to playing such a demanding character. In one of the years most complex roles McConaughey is mesmerizing in every scene never compromising or flinching away from Woodroofs rough edges. In 1985 the hard-partying chain-smoking Woodroof is eking out a living as a rodeo rider and electrician when he is diagnosed with HIV. News that he has the disease -- and only 30 days to live -- comes as a clear shock to the man whos an obvious homophobe. After AZT treatments make him violently ill he heads to Mexico to seek alternative methods. When he finds drugs that help he starts smuggling them over the border and his ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is born.Advertisement Its a compelling story that taps into the FDAs real-life failings in dealing with what was then a death sentence as well as the homophobic attitudes that pervaded the times. The screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack doesnt yield to pat pronouncements or solutions refusing to turn Woodroof into a huggable savior even when his views about gays shift. Nor does Canadian director Jean-Marc Vailee fuss around in presenting Woodroofs hardscrabble world. He makes us feel what it must be like to inhabit the harsh realities of Woodroofs life from his rundown and dirty mobile home to his raunchy sexual encounters.Vailee also reveals his talent as an actors director drawing out two award-worthy performances. In addition to McConaugheys is Jared Letos as Rayon an HIV-infected transsexual who teams up with Woodroof and helps operate the buyers club. The surprisingly believable relationship between Woodroof and Rayon is touching but never overextends into cheesy Hollywood bromance territory. As Rayon Leto is tough heartbreaking and revelatory.The same cant be said for Jennifer Garner who plays Woodroofs physician Eve Saks who happens to also be a friend of Rayons. Garner has been saddled with a role that basically exists to push the story forward. I wish there had been more exchanges between Saks and Rayon to better define who Saks is. She never comes to life.That complaint applies to nothing else in the film and most definitely not McConaughey and Leto. In every moment of screen time its obvious they have put their hearts and souls out there. ""The Dallas Buyers Club"" is all the richer for it.Dallas Buyers Club    1/2Rating R (for pervasive language some strong sexual content nudity and drug use)Cast Matthew McConaughey Jared Leto Jennifer GarnerDirector Jean-Marc VaileeRunning time 1 hour 57 minutesOpens Friday in San Francisco; Nov. 15 in the East Bay and San JosePrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Credit Anne Marie Fox/Focus Features In theaters Friday November 1 3 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars) It starts with a man having sweaty anonymous sex at a rodeo. It ends with that man at a rodeo trying to outlast a certain death sentence. During the space between Ron Woodroof -- as played by Matthew McConaughey in a career-defining performance -- shows a grittiness thats moving and unforgettable. A mere fainting spell lands him in a Texas hospital in 1985. The diagnosis is a jaw-dropper HIV positive. A red-blooded blue-collared electrician hes aghast and disgusted upon hearing the news. The doctors (who include Jennifer Garner) give him 30 days to live and advise comfortable rest. Ron wont hear of it. (""I will die with my boots on"" he growls.) PHOTOS Celebritys 2013 Halloween costumes Determined to prolong his life by any means necessary he devises a plan Head South of the border and get his hands on non-FDA-approved drugs. An act of desperation soon turns into a full-scale business Teaming up with a wily transgendered patient Rayon (Jared Leto incredible after a six-year film hiatus) Ron runs the Dallas Buyers Club to distribute black-market drugs to the sick. PHOTOS Best movies of 2012 But wait. This true story is no melodramatic probe into an ailing cowboys soul. Not once does McConaughey look to the sky and ask why him or cry himself to sleep as the clock ticks on his nightstand. In fact though the actors startling 40-plus-pound weight drop has been chronicled ad nauseam audiences will not see him wither away into a shell. Instead with hallowed cheekbones and a gaunt frame the actor uses his charming drawl to lure in skeptical international doctors needy customers and women. (That said his cozy relationship with Garner -- as earnest as ever -- is the one murky plotline. Are doctors supposed to be going out to dinner with patients?) PHOTOS Matthew McConaugheys hottest shirtless moments Rons snappy partnership with Leto humanizes all the medical jargon. An unlikely ally in Rons fight against AIDS the effeminate Rayon is able to bring out his sensitive side during a trip to the supermarket and shows his street-smart savvy in the successful Club. (And in one of the films looser moments Ron goes berserk when he sees that Rayon has plastered photos of his face on the walls in their office). Ultimately its Leto -- a future Oscar nominee along with shoo-in McConaughey -- who shoulders the emotional heavy lifting here. But not too much After all theres no time for sentimentality when someone is busy taking the bull by the horns.

As Dallas Buyers Club starts hes at a rodeo snorting cocaine with a fistful of bets when he gets it on with two prostitutes. Not a ""healthy"" lifestyle -- one thats left him gaunt weak coughing. With the advantage of hindsight whats ailing him seems obvious now. Back in 1986 it didnt until doctors did a blood test and told him he had 30 days to live. i Rayon played by Jared Leto is a fellow patient who goes into the buyers club business with Woodroof. Anne Marie Fox/Focus Features hide caption toggle caption Anne Marie Fox/Focus Features Rayon played by Jared Leto is a fellow patient who goes into the buyers club business with Woodroof. Anne Marie Fox/Focus Features Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) wont accept that. He offers to pay cash for experimental drugs but until the Food and Drug Administration approves a drug therapy you cant just buy it -- in this country. So Ron heads south of the border where he discovers other things the FDA hasnt approved -- proteins vitamins. Realizing folks in the U.S. are desperate the hustler in him starts hustling. He fills the trunk of his car with pills to bring back again and again -- far too many for his own use which is something the border agents start to notice. Turns out importing drugs for sale is a federal offense. But early AIDS activists came up with a workaround a club. Pay a monthly membership fee and get ""free"" drugs. Woodroofs club soon has people lining up which alarms the medical establishment including a doctor (Jennifer Garner) whod caught his eye when he was diagnosed. McConaugheys flirty drawl and rowdy energy have never been put to better dramatic use than they are in Dallas Buyers Club. His commitment to playing this jerk -- and in the movie he is a jerk if a seductive one -- is almost scary. McConaughey lost 38 pounds to look properly emaciated. Jared Leto did much the same to play Rayon a woman who wasnt born a woman and whos not cowed by Woodroofs homophobia. The filmmakers know theyre pushing buttons in an era when stories about gay people Big Pharma and big government all resonate differently than they did in 1986. And they do not try to outfit their story with false uplift or make it about a community coming together. Dallas Buyers Club is just about a selfish boor who arguably gets a pass in terms of posterity because while looking out for No. 1 he paved the way for change for everyone else.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 1 2013 Save for later Saved Dallas Buyers Club stars Matthew McConaughey. Anne Marie Fox/Focus Features/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Matthew McConaughey has come a long way. Starting out as little more than a matinee idol mannequin he has evolved into a first-rate actor who daringly transforms himself from role to role. Its a great pleasure to witness this spectacle. He validates the idea that talent or its lack is not fixed In the movies as in life you can always be surprised.McConaugheys latest acting marvel - coming after ""Killer Joe"" ""Bernie"" ""Magic Mike"" and ""Mud"" - is in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" as Ron Woodroof the real-life gadabout Texas electrician and rodeo cowboy who in 1985 was diagnosed with AIDS. Given a month to live he frantically searches for alternative therapies to prolong his life. In the process he becomes a kind of inadvertent crusader establishing a ""buyers club"" to sell non-FDA approved medications to people with AIDS.The heterosexual womanizing Ron begins his odyssey at a time when AIDS was thought of as a ""gay disease."" Rejected by most of his friends he finds unexpected new allies in the gay community he used to castigate. He takes on a transgendered business partner Rayon (an extraordinary Jared Leto) who has also received an AIDS diagnosis and their tentative unsentimentalized friendship is the emotional core of this highly emotional movie. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Both McConaughey and Leto dropped a great deal of weight for their roles. (In McConaugheys case he lost 50 pounds; his wizened frame is sometimes painful to behold.) This sort of thing could easily have turned into an acting stunt and Im not entirely sold on the idea that one must drop (or add - remember De Niro in ""Raging Bull""?) pounds to achieve artistic truth. What about just plain old imagination?. But the weight loss is a signifier of how devoted these actors were to their roles. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Director Jean-Marc Vallee and his screenwriters Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack have scrupulously avoided turning Rons story into a socially conscious docudrama. For the most part they succeed although they dont always allow for the ways in which Rons forays into alternative medicine may have been not only self-serving but medically unsound. As Ron challenges the health establishment Big Pharma the FDA and the FBI a halo albeit tarnished can be seen glowing faintly above his head.The real halo here belongs to McConaughey. He does justice to Rons story and to his own quicksilver talent. Grade B+ (Rated R for pervasive language some strong sexual content nudity and drug use.)

We glimpse bulls through the slats running around the arena. We hear panting grunts the sloppy sounds of beasts mating. But its not a real bull. Its just good ol boy Ron Woodroof having a quick one in between bets. Thats the start to ""Dallas Buyers Club"" the based-on-fact story of an unlikely AIDS activist. And although the script itself is fairly conventional (like ""Philadelphia"" its another story of one mans journey to tolerance knocking down cardboard-cutout villains along the way) its told in an artful way and acted superbly. Will it win some Oscar nods? It should. But more importantly it deserves your attention and some respect. If youve seen any picture of Matthew McConaughey over the last year or two you already know the lengths to which he went to play Ron; when the movie begins hes already a walking skeleton his T-cell count down to the single digits. He has a month left the doctors tell him. But a year later Ron is still strutting around -- and still fighting furiously to get the unapproved medicines he thinks will help him. And when the FDA refuses to relent this small-time drug dealer turns big-time drug importer -- cleverly skirting the law by selling not the pills but monthly ""memberships"" that come with free supplies. If McConaughey has over the last year or so made one of the most remarkable career saves in modern Hollywood -- extricating himself from a rom-com graveyard to do ""Magic Mike"" ""Killer Joe"" ""Bernie"" ""The Paperboy"" and ""Mud"" -- this film is the climax. You could still see him trying in some of those films acting with one eye on the camera or at least on the director looking to see how he went over. Here he simply is his Texan drawl a syrupy string of boasts and slurs his eyes burning in his gaunt face like two coals in a snowbank. And he has a marvelous partner -- ""business partner"" Ron would emphasize -- in Jared Leto equally emaciated and completely submerged in the character of Rayon a hip-swinging transgendered drug addict who proves to be Rons connection to his clients (and his surprising admission to a different more supportive world). Director Jean-Marc Vallee tells the story in a mostly straightforward strictly chronological fashion and occasionally that makes the film feel a bit more predictable than Rons life. His relationship with good-but-unconvinced-doctor Jennifer Garner seems like a page from the ""Norma Rae"" playbook -- platonic friendship between two unlikely allies -- than anything like a genuine moment. A few other scenes such as a court challenge are handled perfunctorily. Yet Vallee a French Canadian takes a real delight in the dusty sights and lusty scenes of cowboy Texas where if this trailers rockin dont bother knockin. And he also delivers subtler moments like that beginning which suggests Ron has become just as crudely soulless as the bucking bulls he bets on. He also gets fine performances from his cast (including Steve Zahn and a nearly unrecognizable Griffin Dunne who steals several scenes as a disgraced doctor). But this is McConaugheys movie and definitive proof that he is back to being the actor we always thought he was or could be since ""Dazed and Confused."" Ratings note The film contains sexual situations nudity substance abuse strong language and violence. Dallas Buyers Club (R) Focus (117 min.) Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee.

"Dallas Buyers Club review Matthew McConaughey is great as Ron Woodroof. Slate Sign In Sign Up Matthew McConaughey Is Brilliant as a Randy Homophobe in Dallas Buyers Club Matthew McConaughey Is Brilliant as a Randy Homophobe in Dallas Buyers Club Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 1 2013 838 AM Dallas Buyers Club As a randy homophobe who becomes an AIDS activist Matthew McConaughey is brilliant. By Dana Stevens Matthew McConaughey right and Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club. Courtesy of Anne Marie Fox/Focus Features The opening images of Dallas Buyers Club have a raw primitive vitality A man and two women are having sweaty sex in a stall-like enclosure next to a ring where a rodeo is in progress. As the man grinds and grunts away he can see through the slats in the door as a rider is first thrown from then gored by a bull. The parallelism isnt subtle On both sides of the gate we sense there is a man risking mortal peril. Dallas Buyers Club directed by Jean-Marc Vallee (The Young Victoria) and starring Matthew McConaughey as a hard-living Texan electrician who contracts HIV in the early days of the AIDS epidemic often works broad like that. This is a movie that traffics in deep hindbrain emotions fear and rage and lust and above all the pure animal drive to go on living. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. But Dallas Buyers Club which was scripted by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack feels right just as it is--it wouldnt make sense for the study of a character as outsized and rough-edged as Ron Woodroof to be anything smaller or more restrained. The real-life Woodroof died in 1992 after living much longer with the virus than his doctors had believed possible. After a round of treatment with the early highly toxic AIDS drug AZT left Woodroof at deaths door he nursed himself back to (relative) health with a cocktail of vitamins supplements and still-unapproved antiviral drugs obtained from around the world some via the black market. With the help of a doctor and other patients Woodroof eventually started a ""buyers club"" out of his Oak Lawn Texas apartment offering 400-a-month pharmaceutical packages to HIV-positive people who had either been made sicker by AZT or simply couldnt afford it. As played by McConaughey Ron is an entrepreneur first and an activist second--his empathy for his fellow man particularly his gay fellow man doesnt start to surface until well into the second half of the film. When we first meet him Ron is an unreconstructed rascal a part-time rodeo rider who enjoys his whiskey his women (several at once if possible) and when payday rolls around his weed and cocaine. His first reaction after hes diagnosed with full-blown AIDS and given 30 days to live is to insist that the hospital must have mixed up his blood sample with ""some daisy-pullers"" then head home for a daylong hookers-and-coke bender. Rons deeply ingrained fear and hatred of homosexuals--traits we also witness in his uncharming circle of good ol boy buddies--prevent him from taking either the diagnosis or the treatment seriously until hes so ill hes on the verge of collapse. Advertisement The gradual process by which Ron learns to accept first his illness and then his kinship with other AIDS sufferers gay or straight provides the second half of the movie with moral suspense Yes the buyers-club enterprise is a financial success but will Ron die before he starts helping people for the right reasons? Theres suspense of the more traditional sort as well as an ever-sicker Ron whose fierce will to live has turned him into a kind of gaunt homophobic Energizer Bunny drives across the border to smuggle back unapproved drugs from Mexico passing himself off to border authorities as a cancer-stricken priest. (In this scene and many others Dallas Buyers Club demonstrates a dry gallows wit.) Though theres a hint of romance in the warm relationship between Ron and one of his doctors--played by Jennifer Garner whose virginal sweetness makes a nice foil to McConaugheys permanent aura of debauchery--the central relationship in Dallas Buyers Club is between Ron and Rayon (Jared Leto) an HIV-positive trans woman he meets in the hospital and eventually makes his partner in the drug-selling enterprise. Rayon whos a composite of several real-life people is a complex character--tart-tongued and hypercompetent one minute a drug-addled mess the next--but Leto plays her (or ""him"" as the change-averse Ron insists on continuing to call Rayon even after they become friends) with delicacy and humor and nary a hint of ""look Im a drag queen"" straight-actor self-regard. Late in the film Ron forces one of his homo-hating buddies to shake Rayons hand in a grocery store and Letos barely perceptible smile of triumph is the grace note that makes the scene. Its a performance that should catapult Leto out of the prison of being remembered forever as My So-Called Lifes teen heartthrob (a career move that should it happen I propose we call the Catalanopult.) As for McConaughey hes so fine in this role its hard to shake a sense that hes been prepping for it his whole career. Watching his character waste away onscreen--McConaughey lost 30 pounds for the part and on his lanky frame it looks like much more--we experience the usually buff actor as alarmingly frail which only makes his characters dogged determination to survive (and eventually to help others do the same) that much harder and more powerful to witness. The rowdy drink-life-to-the-dregs philosophy of Ron Woodroof contains more than a little of the DNA of McConaugheys Magic Mike character a large-living strip-club owner named providentially enough Dallas. And both characters have clear genetic links to Wooderson the unapologetic jailbait-chasing libertine in Dazed and Confused who so memorably told his teen acolytes to ""just keep livin."" You could lament McConaugheys ""typecasting"" as a laconic Texas party animal--or you could rejoice that theres an actor out there that can play that type so richly that it transcends mere type-ness. Like Robert Mitchum (to whom hes been persuasively compared) McConaughey isnt an actor we value for his plasticity from role to role but for the special aura he brings with him into every film a dangerous mix of friendliness and menace seduction and threat (all with an undertone of wry humor that wasnt part of Mitchums stock in trade). Whatever you do next Matthew McConaughey just keep livin. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Some of that is the blown-out widescreen images of cinematographer Yves Belanger (a French-Canadian like the director) which capture the lived-in flavor of downscale North Texas in the mid-1980s. (Most of the film was actually shot in Louisiana.) And a whole lot of it is Matthew McConaughey the Renaissance man of independent film giving another electrical performance as a man on the outer margins of society.This time around McConaughey plays a character who might seem like an overly convenient fiction if he werent based on a real person. At least in the United States very few heterosexual males contracted HIV during the peak years of the epidemic (this was and is a lot less true in the developing world) but Dallas electrician and good ol boy Ron Woodroof was one of them. When we meet Ron in the first scene of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" hes backstage at the rodeo arena with some cocaine and a couple of girls. (You dont get the feeling this was a one-time event.) Hes also bone-skinny and suffering from a wracking cough. Ron doesnt know it yet but not merely is he HIV-positive hes got ""full-blown AIDS"" with a T-cell count near zero and an extremely dire prognosis. When Ron lands in the hospital the citys leading AIDS doctor (Denis OHare) tells him he probably has a month to live. (Jennifer Garner plays a more sympathetic doctor who feels like a throw-in for the medical profession and the hetero norms of movieness.)Of course I dont have any idea when or how Ron Woodroof contracted the virus - in the movie he remembers having sex with a woman with IV track marks - but he very quickly finds out what its like to be the object of bigotry. Im not sure we even needed the early scene when Ron offers his unenlightened commentary about the recent revelation that Rock Hudson was a ""cocksucker"" (which locates us in October of 1985) or his response to a friend whos thinking of taking an oil-field job in Saudi Arabia ""Why you want to go work for them sand niggers?"" Ron is a casual racist a casual homophobe a hard-partying mans man whos never really thought about his prejudices or why he holds them. He isnt exactly a likable guy but he has a long lean Lone Star intensity that makes him attractive.Rayon (Jared Leto) a transgender woman Ron meets in the hospital offers her opinion Ron is handsome all right in a ""Texas redneck white-trash kind of way."" Ron heaps abuse on her at first of course - Rayon is consistently called ""him"" in the movie which would be accurate to the time and place - but even if Ron doesnt know it yet the virus is reshaping his social world his view of reality and his relationship to power. Rons outrage when doctors first tell him he has a ""faggot disease"" is matched by the fury he feels when his longtime buddies in the honky-tonk with the Rebel flag on the wall make exactly the same assumption. Of course one could argue that Ron never gave up all the privileges of being a straight white guy in America since he still was one. But in its own way ""Dallas Buyers Club"" makes the radical case that those things are social constructs subject to revocation at any time.Were long past the point where we should be handing out gold stars to mainstream actors for playing LGBT characters but Letos performance as pure-dee Texas-trans Rayon is much more than a matter of feminine attire and affect. To be openly transgender in Dallas in 1985 - for that matter almost anywhere in America that wasnt San Francisco or lower Manhattan - required facing some degree of public hatred and near-universal incomprehension on a daily basis. Leto gives us a fully realized character who has confronted that without having her spirit crushed but who along the way has internalized considerable damage. Rayon has a scene in a grocery store - really its just a single shot with no lines - when she realizes that embittered homophobic Ron has become her advocate her defender and most important her friend that utterly destroyed me. You Might Also Like Along with many other HIV-positive patients in many other places Ron and Rayon came to understand that the widely publicized pharmaceutical rollout of AZT in the mid-80s was a long way short of a viable treatment for AIDS let alone a cure. (In fairness AZT did help some people and still does a point the movie barely mentions.) What begins as Rons solo effort to smuggle unauthorized AIDS drugs he got from a clinic in Mexico evolves into the Dallas Buyers Club - a gray-market clearinghouse for HIV-related drugs and information -- one of the biggest and most ambitious such enterprises in the country.Its probably asking too much to expect a narrative film to get all the medical scientific and legal issues around AIDS treatment right especially since many of those questions remain contentious. What the movie does get right is the way that patients like Woodroof empowered themselves and others end-running the bureaucracy and importing and distributing all kinds of stuff some of which worked and some of which didnt pharmaceuticals from Mexico Canada and Europe that hadnt been approved by the FDA; vitamin mineral and protein cocktails of uncertain or unproven value; naturopathic and herbal remedies that may have been snake oil.Whatever the buyers club movement may have done wrong it was part of a multipronged assault on the pharmaceutical medical and governmental mafia that controlled the production testing and distribution of all new drugs. As seen in David Frances crucial documentary ""How to Survive a Plague"" this many-leveled AIDS activism didnt just accelerate the discovery of drugs that actually saved lives it also changed the American publics relationship to medicine in ways were still dealing with. However you want to describe the enterprise run by the redneck cowboy and the wispy trans-girl (first out of a motel room and then out of a donated house) it defied all political categories. It was libertarian or maybe anarchistic; it certainly had nothing to do with liberalism or the ""left"" which collectively made a sad face and hoped that somehow something good would happen to help all those poor people suffering from that awful disease. At least in the movie version of his life Ron Woodroof has more than a little in common with Rick the Humphrey Bogart bar owner in ""Casablanca."" What begins for him as a business venture a question of self-preservation ends by becoming a matter of principle and a question of the heart. Well I love ""Casablanca"" and although I dont know how accurate a portrait this is of Woodroof (who is certainly a folk hero among AIDS activists) the story about the bad man whose heart is revealed to be good remains as irresistible as ever. McConaughey is vividly even agonizingly alive every single second hes on-screen as a dying man whose business isnt finished and never will be. He surely deserves the Oscar buzz he will get for this role and the timing is right. But forget all that for now. Despite its cliched elements ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a fierce celebration of the unpredictable power that belongs to the outcast the despised the pariah. Thats not a story of the 80s its a story of always.""Dallas Buyers Club"" is now playing in New York and Los Angeles with national release to follow. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Photo Anne Marie Fox/AP/Focus Features More On dallas buyers club Why there are 9 Best Picture nominees at this years Oscars Showbiz veteran blasts Oscar nominees in ballot peek McConaugheys climb from rom-coms to acting greatness Gravity wins big at BAFTA awards MOVIE REVIEW Dallas Buyers Club Paging Oscar. Running time 117 minutes. Rated R (nudity sex drugs profanity). At the Lincoln Square the Chelsea the Loews East Village. Few screen actors have ever had a year as good as Matthew McConaughey who follows up his bravura work as an escaped convict in ""Mud"" with a tour de force as an unforgettable if unlikely true-life Texan hero in Jean-Marc Vallees absorbing ""Dallas Buyers Club."" The film which also contains a must-see performance by Jared Leto as a transsexual portrays the almost unbelievable story of Ron Woodroof a virulently homophobic electrician rodeo rider and casual drug user who becomes an unlikely AIDS activist after being diagnosed with HIV in 1985. Given 30 days to live by the doctor (Denis OHare) who delivers the diagnosis the emaciated Woodroof becomes a self-taught expert who obtains drugs on the black market. He travels to Mexico and other countries for treatments not then available in the United States. For the next seven years of his life Woodroof tirelessly battles with the US medical establishment which at the time had approved a single drug -- the very expensive and highly toxic AZT -- for AIDS. Woodroof also fights off efforts by the FDA and various other federal agencies to shut down his illegal for-profit ""club"" that provides unauthorized drugs for free to AIDS-stricken members who pay monthly ""dues."" McConaughey has never been better than as the charismatic Woodroof who finds himself with the gay community he previously despised after being shunned by his friends (and losing his job) after they learn about his diagnosis. Its a remarkable story vividly and urgently told by French-Canadian director Vallee (""The Young Victoria"") from a pointed schmaltz-free script by Craig Borten and Melissa Wallack. Jennifer Garner does the best work of her career as a doctor who risks her career to help Woodroofs wildly unorthodox crusade. Griffin Dunne is also very good as a disgraced doctor who runs a Mexican clinic -- and becomes Woodroofs first key drug supplier. A virtually unrecognizable Leto tears your heart out (and will certainly get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor) as Rayon a drug-addicted transsexual who becomes Woodroofs closest friend and business partner. Theres great chemistry in the scenes between the avowedly heterosexual macho Woodroof and the vulnerable Rayon who dresses in mens clothes to plead for money from her father in one of the movies most moving scenes. McConaughey himself a sure Oscar nominee for Best Actor depicts Woodroofs unusual journey with great sensitivity. He injects enough levity and sheer charm into his performance to lighten up what could have been a fairly grim chronicle into a highly entertaining and relatable movie. Few actors could have pulled off a scene where Woodroof tries to smuggle drugs across the US-Mexican border by posing as a priest -- or donning a suit in an attempt to order industrial quantities of anti-AIDS drugs on a trip to Japan -- without it seeming ridiculous. McConaughey shed 38 pounds for his role in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" -- and his shocking appearance serves as a vivid reminder of how slowly the medical establishment and government moved against this epidemic.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 603 p.m. EDT October 31 2013Fueled by despair and dogged determination a homophobic creep redeems himself and provides relief to hundreds of people with AIDS in this story based on real events.Matthew McConaughey stars as Ron Woodroof in the true-life tale Dallas Buyers Club.(Photo Anne Marie Fox Focus Features)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of 4Stars Matthew McConaughey Jared Leto Jennifer GarnerRated R; Runtime 1 hour 57 minutes; opens Friday in select citiesThough Matthew McConaugheys dramatic weight loss and gaunt demeanor will get most of the publicity Dallas Buyers Club ( out of four; rated R; opening Friday in select cities) is worth seeing for the strength of his full-bodied performance.After his recent turns in Magic Mike Killer Joe Bernie and Mud McConaughey proves he has evolved from a handsome lightweight to one of the most talented risk-taking actors in Hollywood.His performance here is breathtaking. He begins as a twitchy vulgar hedonistic homophobe and emerges an unlikely hero.McConaughey minus 38 pounds plays Ron Woodroof a Texan electrician whose focus is on seedy after-hours pursuits -- riding rodeo broncos and bedding as many women usually prostitutes as possible. Most of what comes out of his mouth is coarse offensive and self-serving.STORY Matthew McConaughey A midcareer makeover like no otherVIDEO McConaughey Leto get gaunt for Dallas BuyersMORE McConaughey launches Dallas Buyers ClubREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersIn 1985 during the earlier days of the AIDS epidemic he is told hes HIV positive. The diagnosis comes as a shock on several fronts. Not only did Woodroof then 35 feel invulnerable but he regarded the disease as something relegated to homosexual men. Hes given 30 days to live and hell be damned if hell take that lying down. He sneaks AZT -- then the only anti-viral medication available -- from a hospital doing a medical trial but finds it only makes his condition worse. (Though ingesting large amounts of cocaine amphetamines and liquor along with it as he does certainly cant help.)Woodroof may be crass and ignorant but hes no dummy. He researches the disease and then goes into overdrive. He crosses the border into Mexico and tracks down alternative treatments on the black market. In short order hes smuggling these meds into the USA. Soon hes at the helm of a thriving business called a ""buyers club."" The club requires that HIV-positive patients pay monthly dues for access to the treatments sidestepping federal regulations. Woodroof poses a challenge to the established medical community and a problem for the feds who seek to shut him down.What began as a selfish concern -- born of his frustration with the ineffectiveness of AZT -- thrusts Woodroof into the role of a crusader. The energy he once put into carousing he throws into his cause. He becomes an expert on drug trials anti-viral medications FDA regulations court decisions and patents.It helps that Woodroofs good-old-boy pals have turned against him calling him the same epithets he used to toss around freely and helping to sensitize him to what many people with AIDS had to endure.McConaughey is not the only actor to pull off a stupendous transformation.Jared Letos turn as the drug-addicted transsexual Rayon is also terrific. Leto brings this sweet and wounded character to vivid life. A key scene in a grocery store with the two men shows how far cowboy Ron has come and strikes an important emotional note.In contrast to McConaughey and Leto Jennifer Garners role as a sympathetic doctor feels under-written and lackluster.Director Jean-Marc Vallee handles the difficult subject matter deftly heightening its gritty sense of reality with the use of a hand-held camera. Writers Craig Borten and Melissa Wallack have chosen an intriguing anti-hero and refrain from sentimentalizing him. They also infuse the serious subject with welcome sardonic wit.McConaughey plays Woodroof unapologetically without softening his edges. His extreme bigotry is startling but given his circumstances his metamorphosis into a decent human being feels authentic.Through its detailed depiction of the lead character and McConaugheys outstanding portrayal Dallas Buyers Club enlightens compellingly without sermonizing. 56 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1bHawA2Holiday Movies Calendar NovemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this November complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

"Review Dallas Buyers Club led well by McConaughey Leto - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Dallas Buyers Club led well by McConaughey Leto McConaughey gives an Oscar-worthy performance in frayed-at-the-edges AIDS drama Dallas Buyers Club Anne Marie Fox / Focus Features Joji Yoshida as Dr. Hiroshi and Matthew McConaughey as Ron Woodroof in ""Dallas Buyers Club."" Joji Yoshida as Dr. Hiroshi and Matthew McConaughey as Ron Woodroof in ""Dallas Buyers Club."" (Anne Marie Fox / Focus Features) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Few actors can play a grifter and a good ol boy with the laid-back precision of Matthew McConaughey. Between the sidewinder glances the sardonic grin and that slippery Texas drawl he uses irony edge and considerable charm to move us into taking his most questionable characters seriously while we forgive their indiscretions.McConaughey needs all of those substantial powers of persuasion for the gutsy gritty ""Dallas Buyers Club."" He portrays a hard-bitten hard-drinking homophobic Texas redneck named Ron Woodroof who becomes an unlikely warrior on the front lines of AIDS. Jared Leto as Rayon a willowy transsexual who favors hot-pink lipstick plunging necklines and heels matches him biting aside for aside. Together they elevate the movie beyond ordinary biography or overplayed tragedy and give Oscar-worthy performances in the process. Directed with an unsentimental hand by Jean-Marc Vallee from Craig Borten and Melisa Wallacks smart screenplay this cut at the AIDS crisis is marked by unexpected humor and roughneck rebellion as well as heart-wrenching humanity. A feverish film it often mirrors the opening and closing scenes -- a rodeo cowboy on the back of an angry bull. Even with some flaws and flailing ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a rough raw ragged and exhilarating ride.RELATED More movie reviews by The Times The movie follows Woodroof from his HIV diagnosis in 1985 to his death seven years later -- long past the 30 days the doctors first gave him. In Ron the filmmakers have the ideal embodiment of macho outrage. In real life Woodroof used it to fuel his fight against disease and the FDA which expended a great deal of energy to slow approval and shut down access to experimental drugs even as the death toll mounted. Besides AIDS the agency is the films primary enemy. Much of the movies conflict is linked to Woodroofs confrontations with FDA official Richard Barkley (Michael ONeill) both trying to outmaneuver the other.But Rons anti-gay bias serves another purpose. The film uses his paranoia to expose the raw nerves of the country circa 1985 when fear of accidentally contracting HIV ran high and misconceptions about homosexuality were rampant. It is telling that when his doctors -- Dr. Sevard (Denis OHare) and key researcher Eve (Jennifer Garner) -- diagnose HIV the panic and anger that follow are bound up in Woodroofs fear that someone might think he is gay.Though the films opens with a death sentence -- Woodroof apparently contracted the virus from unprotected sex with a main-lining hooker -- ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is really about beating the odds. Woodroof is determined to find use and also sell the most promising AIDS cocktails. The search for the latest meds takes him from Mexico to Japan to Germany with the authorities -- the DEA and IRS joining the FDA -- nipping at his heels. Their skirmishes put on trial Big Pharmas role in the development and distribution of AIDS drugs and the FDAs red tape and glacial pace.VIDEO Southern drawls on film The human story is the more interesting one.HIV does not turn Woodroof into the understanding type not even when lifelong friends desert and ridicule him. What ultimately softens Woodroof is Rayon. They meet in the hospitals AIDS ward. Their relationship begins as a testy business arrangement a way for Woodroof to sell bootlegged AZT to the gay community. That leads to the creation of the Dallas Buyers Club where a 400 membership comes with a months supply of medication.Over time their bond evolves into a real friendship that somehow exists alongside the biases Woodroof cant quite let go. Its a credit to both actors how well they walk the love-hate line.To play a dying man McConaughey dropped enough weight to look as if he is at deaths door as did Leto. Both are gaunt with McConaugheys weight loss so extreme as to border on distraction. But its not the exterior that makes the man. McConaughey channels the spirit of a revolutionary and the soul of a redneck in what is one of his most affecting performances yet. Its been a good year for the actor with another star turn as a backwoods romantic on the run in ""Mud."" With ""Dallas"" he continues to shift from rom-com light to serious significant roles.PHOTOS Fall movie sneaks 2013Letos performance though is the revelation. Hes tended to be more of an ensemble player in films like 1998s ""The Thin Red Line"" or 2000s ""Requiem for a Dream."" His starring roles have come in overlooked indies like ""Mr. Nobody"" in 2009 ""Chapter 27"" in 2007. Rayon should change all that. Its a hauntingly authentic performance; the tailored suit he puts on to meet with his disapproving father is one of the films most moving scenes.The difficulties in ""Dallas"" exist around the edges. Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent all-American girl albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here.Meanwhile Vallee lets the bureaucratic bad guys played by ONeill and OHare whose doc is desperate to keep his clinical trials going get far too close to parody. Compared to the French Canadian directors earlier work -- whether his 2005 dramatic take on love in the well-received ""C.R.A.Z.Y"" or the romantic drama of 2009s ""The Young Victoria"" -- ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is by far his most challenging film. And though it represents a career high at times it gets the best of him. Ultimately the movies strength lies in the performances of McConaughey and Leto. The actors bring a kind of flinty resilience to their characters despite a relentless disease and an irreversible fate.

Also starring Jennifer Garner. (Photo/Video Focus Features) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Oct. 31 2013 150 p.m. ET Matthew McConaughey continues to amaze. Last year he was dazzling as a nightclub owner (named Dallas) in ""Magic Mike."" Earlier this year he was zestful and graceful in ""Mud."" Now in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" hes extravagantly funny and deeply affecting as Ron Woodroof a dissolute homophobic Texas electrician and sometime cowboy diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1985. That diagnosis at that time amounts to a death sentence. But Ron gives himself and other desperate sufferers a new lease on life by searching out alternative treatments--alternative to almost nothing since the government and Big Pharma have barely begun a response to the AIDS plague. Then reinventing himself as an entrepreneur in the AIDS underground he sets up a club that allows members to buy drugs he has smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico and farther-flung sources. This classic tale of a little guy taking on giants benefits from being essentially true and from accomplished filmmaking but most of all from the beautiful vitality of Mr. McConaugheys performance. WSJ Film Critic Joe Morgenstern reviews Dallas Buyers Club and lauds Matthew McConaughey for another dazzling performance. It isnt clear how Ron contracted the disease and the stages he goes through cant be found in Kubler-Ross except for a brief and lusty period of denial when a doctor tells him hes got 30 days to put his affairs in order. ""Heres a news flash"" the emaciated patient bellows. ""There aint nothin out there that can kill Ron Woodroof in 30 days."" This also proves to be true; the real-life Ron outlived his sentence by seven years. The lively surprising script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack goes through occasional stages of schematic drama--shades of "" Erin Brockovich""--that make Rons adversaries more rigid than they may have been. And its vague on the subject of how effective his clubs drugs really are. For the most part though the writing is equal and then some to the quicksilver quality of its heros personality. Ron doesnt decide to join the gay community. He simply moves in by barely perceptible degrees. In the same way he loathes then loathes less then accepts as a business partner then cares for and finally loves a transvestite Rayon (superb work by Jared Leto) whom he first encounters when theyre hospital roommates. Gaining or Losing Weight for a Role Matthew McConaughey lost 47 lbs. for his role in ""Dallas Buyers Club."" A look at other actors who lost or gained poundage for their roles. Tom Hanks in Philadelphia TriStar PicturesPhotofest ""Dallas Buyers Club"" which was directed with flair and fluency by Jean-Marc Vallee is a showcase of fine performances some of them notable for their restraint. Jennifer Garners Eve Rons mainstream doctor is a compassionate woman who says more with her eyes than with her mouth. She is also a partially written woman with no noticeable life outside her profession but youd never know it from the warmth of Ms. Garners portrayal. Griffin Dunne is quietly grounded and intriguingly complex as Dr. Vass a defrocked American doctor running a scruffy clinic in Mexico. The cast includes Denis OHare Steve Zahn Michael ONeill and Dallas Roberts. At the center of the showcase Mr. McConaughey manages to be hugely entertaining and improbably heroic often at the same time. Driving through a U.S. border checkpoint with a trunkful of unregulated drugs from his Mexican connection Ron passes himself off as a priest. Returning from a drug buy in Japan he pretends to be a doctor. (These escapades are based on fact.) ""Do you ever wear any colors?"" he asks Eve who usually doesnt. He does--every color of the emotional rainbow from deep despair in the face of death to incandescent delight at being alive. Watch a clip from the documentary film ""The Square."" A group of Egyptian revolutionaries battle leaders and regimes risking their lives to build a new society of conscience. (Photo/Video Participant Media) The Square With the anguish of hindsight ""The Square"" is more than a microcosmic account of the events that have convulsed Egypt in the past couple of years. Jehane Noujaims stirring documentary focused on the demonstrations and protests in Cairos Tahrir Square is a chronicle of blasted hope and a demonstration in its own right of why the popular revolution against 30 years of Hosni Mubaraks rule was unable to prevail after Mubarak was driven from office. The film starts in February 2011 when protests fill Tahrir Square. Energized by their own courage in the face of a brutal police crackdown the demonstrators are seized by a kind of ecstasy. An Islamist identified only as Magdy declares ""We are one society."" A young firebrand Ahmed embraces a fellow protester. ""I am telling you good things are coming"" he says. ""Good things Thank God"" ENLARGE Egyptian activists Khalid Abdalla left and Ahmed Hassan in Jehane Noujaims documentary ""The Square."" Noujaim Films Magdy and Ahmed are the narratives protagonists friends whose shared dreams and divergent beliefs reflect those of their turbulent nation. Ahmed a secular Muslim in his mid-20s is a prodigy of eloquence and optimism. Magdy a father of four in his mid-40s is less articulate but no less joyous when President Mubarak suddenly steps down; Magdy had been abducted and tortured by the Mubarak regime for his membership in the Muslim Brotherhood. This structure may be simplistic but it serves the film well by personalizing the revolutions basic conflict. When good things fail to materialize and the military remains in charge long after Mubaraks removal Ahmed suspects that the Muslim Brotherhood has been using the demonstrations to hijack the movement while Magdy distances himself from the protests in obedience to Brotherhood orders. Ms. Noujaims sympathies are clearly secular. In the run-up to the elections that brought the Brotherhood to political power her film depicts a nation faced with bad alternatives--the Muslim Brotherhood or continued military rule. ""There are no decent political parties"" says Khalid Abdalla who also figures prominently in the narrative; hes the British-Egyptian actor who starred in ""The Kite Runner"" and who served as a media-wise spokesman for the uprising. Still ""The Square"" stands as a valuable document of a tormented time an anatomy of a revolutionary movement doomed by a paucity of viable institutions and by the movements failure to advance a coherent agenda. (Its all the more heartbreaking when a speaker at one of the protests cries fervently ""We will fill the world with poetry."") In the bitter aftermath of the elections and the militarys subsequent ouster of the Islamist government headed by Mohamed Morsi Magdy is bereft a man torn between country and party while Ahmed has regained some of the buoyancy he lost when the Islamists took power. ""The people"" he insists ""will continue to pull rulers out of power until we reclaim our rights and rebuild the country ourselves."" It would seem a wistful dream in the present circumstances but a dream that is shared by Mr. Abdalla the actor and ardent activist. ""I think whats happening is more powerful than any one individual or organization"" he says. ""Its something fundamental inside people that is moving them. I dont know how you kill that."" Watch a clip from the film ""Enders Game."" Young Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is recruited and trained to lead soldiers into a battle that will determine the future of Earth. Also starring Harrison Ford. (Photo/Video Summit Entertainment) Enders Game Who could have guessed that ""Gravity"" would be topped--or bottomed--so soon after its release? Not only does ""Enders Game"" have many scenes in zero gravity but this zero-sum fiasco has zero drama zero suspense zero humor zero charm and zero appeal. It is however a genuine mystery--an expensive-looking sci-fi adventure rated PG-13 and aimed at younger audiences in which nothing of any consequence happens until the last few minutes when the plot takes a foolish twist and the film turns into a muddled polemic about the immorality of preventive wars. ENLARGE Left to right Ben Kingsley and Asa Butterfield in Enders Game. Summit Entertainment ""Enders Game"" was directed by Gavin Hood who adapted the screenplay from the Orson Scott Card novel. In the original source material government leaders breed child geniuses then give them military training as Earths best hope of defending itself against a recurrent threat of alien invasion. The cream of the movies crop Ender Wiggin is played by Asa Butterfield who was the blank-faced boy of the title in Martin Scorseses ""Hugo."" His face isnt as inexpressive as it was but his character is insufferably manipulative and generally dislikable and thats only the beginning of the movies woes. For one thing Ender doesnt seem all that brilliant despite his superiors belief that he like Keanu Reevess blank-faced Neo in ""The Matrix"" is The One. (The commander in charge of his training is played by Harrison Ford who infuses the role with whats become his patented gloom; the actors theme song should be ""Bring In the Frowns."") For another the geniuses who made this soulless spectacle have mistaken training in which little is at stake for genuine action. After Ender and his classmates go into training they go into another phase of training which is followed by more training for further levels of training through war-game simulations all of it as involving as the video-game abstractions of ""Speed Racer."" The games in zero gravity are meant to evoke Quidditch and Harry Potter but I kept thinking of splurge guns and Bugsy Malone. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Mud (2013) Matthew McConaughey plays a charismatic drifter named Mud in Jeff Nicholss third feature which abounds in surprise unadorned beauty and unforced wisdom. Muds charisma lies in the wide eyes of his beholders a couple of 14-year-olds who come upon him hiding out from the law on a little island in the Mississippi River; his literal hideout is an abandoned boat nestled high in the branches of a tree where it was deposited by a flood. The movie belongs to the teenage buddies as much as to the title character and echoes of Mark Twain arent accidental. ENLARGE Control Room (2004) Jehane Noujaims documentary should be essential viewing for people who want to expand their understanding of how the U.S. has been seen in the Arab world. The film is an admittedly sympathetic appraisal of al-Jazeera the Qatar-based satellite channel during the second Iraq war. News management is the issue. ""Control Room"" shows how coverage is tailored to fit the audience both by al-Jazeera and its Western counterparts. Ms. Noujaims documentary neither justifies nor condemns this but lets us judge al-Jazeeras clearly partisan approach against the sanitized--and partisan--coverage on American television. ENLARGE Starship Troopers (1997) Heres a case of sci-fi training that leads swiftly to action when eager bright-eyed earthlings take on the arachnid hordes in Paul Verhoevens film based on Robert A. Heinleins angry militaristic novel of the same name. Our doughboys and doughgirls have gone through rigorous training but nothing could have prepared them for a planet crawling with thousands of giant bugs. Nothing prepared me for the films bold initially ironic stance toward using kids as cannon fodder. Yet the action eventually obliterates any traces of irony in this vast elegantly executed enterprise.

"Dallas Buyers Club rides the bull and cuts through it review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDallas Buyers Club rides the bull and cuts through it review Dallas Buyers Club is really about the triumph of the untamed human spirit. Matthew McConaughey leaves his pretty-boy image behind to play Ron Woodroof an early AIDS patient in Dallas Buyers Club.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 31 2013Dallas Buyers ClubStarring Matthew McConaughey Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner. Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee. Opens Nov. 1 at Varsity Cinemas. 117 minutes. 18AA lot of bull gets ridden and tossed about in Dallas Buyers Club. But its the untamed human spirit that slips the corral in this stirring film which courts Oscar attention for co-stars Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto.Article Continued BelowSet in the latter half of the 1980s this fact-based drama from Quebecs Jean-Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y. The Young Victoria) approaches the AIDS crisis through two unconventional heroes. First and foremost is profane and proud Texan Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) a Dallas electrician and rodeo cowboy who refuses to go quietly when his high-risk lifestyle of unprotected sex illicit drug use and reckless boozing puts him at deaths door. Told by an unfeeling doctor that hes contracted HIV the virus that causes AIDS and that he has just three months to live his instant reaction is denial and anger. Woodroof is a heterosexual dammit not like that dandy Rock Hudson whose revelations about homosexuality and AIDS the cowboy and his pals mock in an early scene.An even earlier scene framed by Vallee and cinematographer Yves Belanger (Laurence Anyways) from the perspective of a caged animal shows Woodroof mindlessly rutting in a corral with two women at least one of them an intravenous drug user. Its the hellish prologue to Woodroofs current dilemma.Sympathy is not immediate for this devil. Hes a good ol boy with an evil mind one filled with homophobic and racist thoughts and also a great deal of stubborn ignorance about how straight people also get AIDS. Hes on the side of the righteous though when that same heartless doc (Denis OHare) decides Woodroof isnt a candidate for treatment with the experimental drug AZT once thought to be a silver bullet against AIDS. The Food and Drug Administration would frown he coldly reasons.""Screw the FDA"" Woodroof thunders. ""Im going to be DOA""Through unaccustomed library study and a network of sources he learns that Mexico and other countries are taking a more proactive approach to HIV and AIDS getting better results than with the quickly discredited AZT.Using stealth disguise and chutzpah Woodroof starts importing unapproved drugs vitamins and proteins to illicitly treat himself and other AIDS sufferers skirting the law and nose-thumbing petty bureaucrats with a unique pay-for-access scheme he calls the Dallas Buyers Club.He becomes a hero to the afflicted and a villain to outraged authorities and McConaughey who lost some 40 pounds for the role plays him with a faultless blend of vinegar and honey. The role is the capper to two years of solid performances -- in Magic Mike Mud Bernie and Killer Joe -- that prove his acting chops and erase his bare-chested pretty boy image.Hes a ferocious talent and so is Jared Leto the other hero of this David versus Goliath drama who also starved himself for the role. As Woodroofs transgender sidekick Rayon the type of person Ron would normal beat up or mock he looks past the arrogance and homophobia of his unlikely friend and ally to see the decent person within.Rayon is a one-man Pride parade in his gaudy attire moving to the beat of glam-rocker Marc Bolan and hes also an exemplar of tolerance. By sheer force of will but also irresistible charm he moves Woodroof (and all of us) to shun fear and ignorance and to embrace love. Leto never overdoes the campier elements of his character no mean feat.McConaughey and Leto are so much the shining stars of Dallas Buyers Club its inevitable that others would pale in comparison. Such is the fate of Jennifer Garner who as Dr. Eve Saks Woodroofs main physician at Dallas Mercy Hospital fails to stray far from the white-shoed stereotype. Shes sympathetic but powerless and the screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack doesnt give her much of a chance to evolve. Ditto for Steve Zahns buddy cop character who has an uncanny ability to be around whenever Woodroof is causing mayhem but doesnt have a whole lot to do. Muddied timelines and events also weigh down the story as does an excess of drug jargon. Script and pacing problems aside Dallas Buyers Club remains an awards-worthy showcase of McConaugheys and Letos ferocious talents matched only by their astonishing physical decline onscreen. We see the highs and lows of the AIDS struggle played out on the canvas of their bodies.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

By David Denby McConaughey has recently become one of the most inventive actors in movies.   Credit Illustration by Stamatis Laskos Some of the famous male movie actors of the past like James Stewart and John Wayne aged slowly and naturally achieving greater depth in their roles as a privilege of years. Robert Redfords superlative performance in ""All Is Lost"" is the major case at the moment for the power of ripeness. What has happened with Matthew McConaughey now turning forty-four is more abrupt and startling. The gleaming young man of a few years ago with the brilliant smile and the golden torso--an easygoing sport who temperamentally never seemed more than fifty yards from the beach--has become one of the most inventive actors in movies. Just recently McConaughey has given exploratory strikingly intelligent performances in a wide variety of roles the reticent Texas lawyer in ""Bernie""; the happy-in-sleaze male-strip-club owner in ""Magic Mike; and the fantasizing runaway outlaw in love with a faithless woman in ""Mud."" And now in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" as the real-life Ronald Woodroof he does work that is pretty much astounding. Woodroof was an electrician rodeo hot shot and hetero fornicator who in 1985 tested H.I.V.-positive. Im thinking not simply of McConaugheys physical transformation--the nearly fifty pounds lost the change from an Adonis to a dark spidery skeleton. His body now appears shaped by overuse and neglect like the off-kilter frames of oil workers and coal miners in Richard Avedons magnificent collection ""Into the West""--men whose character is seemingly pulled by taut neck muscles right into their burning eyes. But its McConaugheys spiritual transformation that is most remarkable. His gaze is at once desperate and challenging. When we first see Woodroof hes already ill but he doesnt know it. A rough-and-ready guy with indifferent companions (he doesnt seem to much care for any of his friends) he works drinks smokes gambles rides bulls and has sex with groupies in the rodeo pens. Like a Las Vegas m.c. he swivels back from the waist as he welcomes his unappetizing chums to his plywood-lined pleasure palace in a trailer park. His style is cheap and show-offy but who can tell him that? In his world hes king an ignorant but fast-talking swashbuckler whose speech is garnished by belittling profanities tucked into the corners of sentences--you have to listen hard to hear them. After an accident at work Ron is taken to the hospital and when he wakes up hes confronted by two doctors (Dennis OHare and Jennifer Garner) who tell him that his T-cell count is down to nine. They give him thirty days to live. He snarls that hes not ""a faggot"" and storms out. The French-Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee shot the bulk of the film in trailer parks scrappy construction sites and seamy rodeo pens. He doesnt clean up anything and he doesnt avoid scenes of suffering. But Vallee has given ""Dallas Buyers Club"" the pace and the verve of a classic commercial movie. The script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack is raw and urgent and McConaugheys performance drives the movie forward the way Julia Roberts propelled ""Erin Brockovich."" Both movies are about cocky self-taught outsiders who take on the establishment--obnoxious egotists who create new realities around them. ""Dallas"" plunges us back into that period of mid-nineteen-eighties anguish when people with AIDS seemed to be living in a war zone and help was at best a long way off. AZT is being given a double-blind trial in a Dallas hospital under F.D.A. auspices and Ron unable to get into the trial buys the drug from a larcenous orderly. When he cant get any more he goes to Mexico where a renegade American doctor (Griffin Dunne) tells him that large doses of AZT are toxic and gives him a mixture of zinc aloe vitamins fatty acids the protein Peptide T and the less potent drug DDC. Woodroof survives and studying everything he can get his hands on begins importing drugs approved in other countries (but not by the F.D.A.) which he blends into a primitive cocktail. He sets up a buyers club in a Dallas motel and sells memberships for four hundred dollars a month; after paying the dues the client gets the drugs ""for free."" Its a dicey business dependent on smuggling bribes and deceit but he wins the sympathy of his doctor (Garner) who agrees that the F.D.A. is moving with maddening caution while across the country people are dying. Rons frenzied impatience leads to brilliant self-creation the rodeo bum is reborn as a world-travelling capitalist. Entrepreneurship and mutual survival join together. The distinction between huckster and savior dissolves. The man has the goods. A conventional homophobe Ron is mortified by the disease then becomes furious as his friends back away from him. He experiences the bitterness of abandonment just as many gay men did in the eighties. During one of his hospital stays he meets another AIDS patient Rayon (Jared Leto) a cross-dresser with lovely eyes and a seductive and witty come-on. Leto hasnt done much acting recently but hes sensational here. Lean and beautiful he wears heels and furs well and his Rayon shows a shrewd business sense. The entire movie is built around a redemptive irony the hyper-macho straight man needs a knowing and popular gay man to gain him entry to the Dallas subworld--mangy parks ecstatic bars--where he can sell memberships. Woodroof never loses his disdain for gays but his friendship with a cross-dressing flirt humanizes him. Twenty years ago few people could have guessed that McConaughey would ever play such a role. He grew up in small-town Texas (Uvalde and Longview) where his father was an oil-pipe supply dealer his mother a kindergarten teacher. He thought briefly of becoming a lawyer but drifted toward acting as a student at the University of Texas. In 1993 Richard Linklater a nascent Austin movie honcho added him to the cast of the buzzed high-school comedy ""Dazed and Confused."" McConaughey with floppy hair and a soft mustache plays a former football star whos still hanging out with the seniors and hoping to score with a redheaded girl. He doesnt really speak his lines; the words ooze out of him like melted margarine. A few years later in ""A Time to Kill"" (1996) a John Grisham adaptation directed by Joel Schumacher he graduated to the first of his attorney roles--a young married father who defends a black man facing the death penalty in a racially divided Mississippi town. The role isnt clearly conceived. The lawyer seems a committed anti-racist and a feckless lazybones at the same time and McConaughey never finds a workable rhythm. Hes vague diffident his voice slack. Sandra Bullock as an aggressive visiting law student who helps the attorney runs circles around him; their scenes together are a little embarrassing. As a lawyer again in Steven Spielbergs high-minded abolitionist drama ""Amistad"" (1997) McConaughey picked up the pace and attempted a Northeasterners speech patterns. He wore granny glasses and his hair was fluffed into a soft blond cloud; he was so earnest and unemphatic that he hardly registered. And again he got swept aside by a stronger performer Anthony Hopkins doing a shrewdly flinty turn as John Quincy Adams. McConaughey wasnt much of an actor but he always had his burnished glow and a drawling delivery that some found sexy. Hollywood realized that this passivity could be put to use. He started playing in romantic comedies a great catch who didnt want to be caught or a man who didnt know what he wanted until a woman told him. Jennifer Lopez falls for him in ""The Wedding Planner"" (2001) as does Kate Hudson in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" (2003) and Sarah Jessica Parker in ""Failure to Launch"" (2006). In ""Failure"" he plays a thirty-five-year-old weekend athlete who is still living at home with his parents. He banters pleasantly with Parker but irresponsibility was becoming a chronic condition--the movie seemed to be as much about the actor as about the character. You wondered how much pride McConaughey had. Quite a lot it turns out. His triumphs of the past few years have revealed a stirring streak of recklessness. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" doesnt tell us how many people were helped by Woodroofs cocktails--or even if they were effective. (Woodroof himself lived for another seven years.) And the movie the first major Hollywood film to depict a straight man with AIDS may be accused of trying to win sympathy from a mainstream audience that didnt always give gay men much sympathy. Yet ""Buyers Club"" captures the defiance and the self-transformation that many people with AIDS went through (as was movingly chronicled in the 2012 documentary ""How to Survive a Plague"") and it doesnt go soft. Ron is not a nice man; hes a cantankerous hard-pressed man with heroic strength. McConaughey stays in character as a low-down guy his eyes darting this way and that as he calculates the angles. His energy is so keenly focussed that he nearly erases memory of his vacant earlier work. His Ron Woodroof could make a believer out of anyone.

Its the true story of Dallas pussy-hound Ron Woodroof a rabid gay-basher who wound up helping in the fight against the AIDS virus mostly to save his own rodeo-cowboy ass. More News Dallas Buyers Club Is Not All Glum Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> ""You hear Rock Hudson was a cocksucker?"" a revolted Ron asks his buddies when the rugged Hollywood star succumbs to complications from AIDS in 1985. Suddenly the ""gay disease"" hits home especially for Ron who is diagnosed with HIV from sex with a female druggie. No matter. His pals paint the words ""faggot blood"" on the side of his house and run the other way. So does the medical profession. Dr. Sevard (Denis OHare) at Dallas Mercy gives Ron 30 days to live. Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity) offers a chance in the form of an AZT trial. But a chance isnt good enough for Ron whose body is wasting away (McConaughey dropped 38 pounds for the role). He steals AZT and when that doesnt work he travels to Mexico to try experimental drugs administered by Dr. Vass (a terrific Griffin Dunne). Ron feels alone. The FDA drags its heels. Big Pharma keeps pushing costly AZT. Gays still make him puke especially Rayon (Jared Leto) the transsexual druggie he first met at the hospital in Dallas. But Rayon is not to be deterred. Leto gives an award-caliber performance of uncanny skill. He makes sure Rayon never loses her caustic wit and touchingly beleaguered grace. Leto is flat-out perfect. When Ron figures out a way to jump legal hurdles - hell form a Dallas Buyers Club that gives away alternative non-approved medicines but charges a monthly membership fee - its Rayon who becomes his right hand. Just dont expect to find Ron in big hugs with Rayon and AIDS support groups. Ron is a hardass but his grudging respect for the gay activists he meets comes through loud clear and minus the usual Hollywood bullshit. All credit to the impassioned script from Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack that started when Borten first interviewed Ron in 1992. And to Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y.) for using hand-held cameras to keep Rons journey burning with ferocity and feeling. The movie brutally funny and vitally touching as it is sometimes trips on its ambitions. McConaughey doesnt. Much has been written about his career roll from rom-com to the highs of Mud Magic Mike Bernie and Killer Joe. But what McConaughey does here is transformative. Damn hes good. Ron lived for nearly seven years after his death sentence. McConaughey makes sure we feel his tenacity and triumphs in the treatment of AIDS. His explosive unerring portrayal defines what makes an actor great blazing commitment to a character and the range to make every nuance felt.

(ANNE MARIE FOX) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 31 2013 1200 PM Title Dallas Buyers Club Film Info Matthew McConaughey Jared Leto Jennifer Garner A man dying of AIDS transports drugs into the U.S. Director Jean-Marc Vallee (157). R Nudity sexuality language drug use. Village 7 Lincoln Square Chelsea Cinemas. Theres a lot going on in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" including bull-riding drug use disease flamboyance a historical look at the AIDS crisis and a ""Texas white trash hick"" (as hes called) bucking the health system. But at the center is someone embarking on a new kind of life just as hes been given a death sentence. Adding to the punch hes played in an extraordinary turn by Matthew McConaughey who himself is in the midst of a career reinvention. This moving funny scary true-life story surrounds him with a brash kind of ballsiness. McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof an electrician and rodeo rider in 1985 Dallas. The wild-card Woodroof first seen romping with girls in the corner of an auditorium has a construction site accident and is told by doctors his blood tests positive for HIV. Given 30 days to live Woodroof rebels with hookers and blow. In the hospital again he meets Rayon (Jared Leto) a transgendered AIDS sufferer who gets past Woodroofs disgust after a game of poker. Jared Leto as Rayon and Matthew McConaughey as Ron Woodroof in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" (Anne Marie Fox / Focus Features) Rayon is taking part in a clinical trial for AZT. When Woodroof whose previous knowledge of his own disease was limited to Rock Hudson jokes cant get in on the trial (""Screw the FDA Im DOA"" he yells to a sympathetic doctor played by Jennifer Garner) he buys AZT from a hospital worker and hears of Mexicos black market. With research Woodroof finds drugs unapproved by the FDA. A renegade doc (Griffin Dunne) south of the border gets Ron off the dangerous AZT and on a program of unapproved -- but not illegal -- proteins vitamins and medicine. Back in Dallas Woodroof needs Rayon to start selling the shipments to men in need. The two become business partners starting a so-called ""buyers club"" 400 memberships equals unlimited drugs. The dividend isnt only tons of cash but a ton of humanity that the crass rodeo cowboy Woodroof wasnt counting on. Director Jean-Marc Vallee lets the rhythms of Woodroofs condition dictate the action. When he gets a 30-day deathwatch the film marks the days -- thanks to the vitamins they hit 2557 -- and the soundtrack echoes with the ringing sound in Woodroofs head. Jennifer Garner stars as Dr. Eve Saks in ""Dallas Buyers Club."" (ANNE MARIE FOX) The commitment McConaughey brings is something to behold. Emaciated from the moment we see him hes unrecognizable from his other recent tours de force in ""Magic Mike"" and ""Mud."" Woodroofs mix of Texas blowhard and eccentric bozo is clearly his strong suit. If Woodroof is the movies guts Rayon is its heart and Leto (TVs ""My So-Called Life"" ""Alexander"") is stunningly perfect even when the story veers ever so slightly into expected territory. A scene in which Rayon wears a suit to ask his disapproving father for money to help Woodroof is achingly poignant. Leto and McConaughey make it impossible not cheer these lost-and-found souls tough tender fight. On a mobile device? Click here to watch video.

Probably too much. Our knee-jerk reverence for this extreme form of artistic commitment tends to confuse shocking physical transformations with great acting. Or conversely it can reduce what are accomplished performances to self-indulgent actorly stunts. But when Christian Bale ghoulishly turned himself into a skin-and-bones specter in The Fighter and Michael Fassbender wasted away as political prisoner Bobby Sands in Hunger we felt like we were spying on two actors dangerously blurring the line between Method and madness. The number of pounds they shed was just one facet of their powerful portrayals. In the new film Dallas Buyers Club Matthew McConaughey pulls off a similar feat. As a man sentenced to death in the terrifying and confusing early days of the AIDS epidemic he digs deep and summons a raw go-for-broke ferocity thats as harrowing as it is unforgettable. Putting aside for a moment that the film itself isnt quite as nuanced as his performance what McConaughey accomplishes here should be considered the culmination of an unlikely career overhaul that began with 2011s The Lincoln Lawyer and then continued with unselfconscious turns in Bernie Magic Mike and Mud. If there was any doubt that McConaughey is more than just a tawny-chested rom-com stud there should be no question anymore. Dallas Buyers Club is based on the true story of Ron Woodroof a rodeo-loving Texas good ol boy who has a work accident that lands him in the hospital where a routine blood test reveals that he has HIV. When hes told he has 30 days to live all that the bigoted proudly heterosexual Ron can think to say is ""I aint no faggot"" Can a man like this be redeemed? Thats the prickly question Jean-Marc Vallees film sets out to answer. Considered too far gone to benefit from AZT trials he bribes a hospital janitor to get him doses of the experimental drug and then gobbles the pills down like a fistful of beer nuts with a booze and cocaine chaser. When his supply dries up Ron heads to a fleabag clinic in Mexico where an unlicensed American doctor (Griffin Dunne) starts him on a cocktail of non-FDA-approved vitamins and proteins. Even though hes a dead man Ron recognizes a business opportunity when he sees one. Soon hes not only getting healthier hes also smuggling his south-of-the-border remedy back to the States where he starts a specialized club. For a 400 monthly membership fee terminal AIDS patients dont buy theyre given the drugs -- a scheme that allows Ron to temporarily skirt the law on a technicality. His partner in crime is Rayon a glamorously sarcastic and ailing transgender woman played by a heartbreaking Jared Leto. If Ron has the business smarts Rayon is his entree into Dallas gay customer base. Their friendship is undeniably touching but its also a bit tough to buy at face value -- the lifelong homophobe who undergoes an overnight conversion. Rons relationship with a sympathetic doctor (Jennifer Garner in an underwritten role) is equally unconvincing. Meanwhile his adversaries -- the FDA the DEA and the doctors in bed with Big Pharma -- are painted as one-dimensional mustache twirlers. Still thanks to McConaugheys and Letos fearless performances as two terminally ill men going to whatever lengths it takes swallowing as many pills and injecting as many syringes as necessary to survive another day Dallas Buyers Club achieves a sort of grace. Its been 20 years since Tom Hanks put a movie stars face on the AIDS crisis in Philadelphia. Since then Hollywood has largely ignored one of the most tragic chapters of the 20th century. Considering that track record even a movie as imperfect as Dallas Buyers Club is something worth celebrating.

Matthew McConaughey a mumbling Hollywood-honed Texas actor with a severely limited range whom I have never much liked on the screen goes the distance at last and wins the crown. In Dallas Buyers Club the cocky preening mewling drawl that whistles through his teeth in every film works in his favor to present a perfect picture of reluctant real-life hero Ron Woodroof the hateful brawling womanizing homophobic Dallas electrician and redneck rodeo cowboy who turned out to be one of the accidental saviors of gay men during the height of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. Its a true story turned with precision and care into one of the most riveting and inspiring films of the year. In 1985 Ron Woodroof was clueless about AIDS. He was a brawling drunken chain-smoking drug-dealing foul-mouthed bigot with no concern for the sick and disenfranchised of the world and scarcely little more for his own health. (In fact the first scene shows him in a cocaine-hazed three-way with two trashy whores in a rodeo holding pen; it gets raunchier from there.) When a minor work accident lands him in the hospital the doctors discover he has HIV and a near-fatally low blood count of 9 T-cells. He goes viral reacting with his fists. But when his lady doctor (Jennifer Garner) predicts he has about 90 days to live he starts reviewing his options. Unwilling to participate in clinical trials aimed at homosexuals and forced to settle for limited doses of the toxic government-approved experimental drug AZT he bribes a hospital orderly then crosses the border into Mexico to investigate alternative treatments. First thinking only of his own selfish needs extending the drug smuggling business to other unfortunates in need of illegal medications looks like a good investment. As his immune system plummets and he develops pneumonia the only meds that help are not approved by the FDA so he imports them disguised as a priest. Pretty soon to his horror he finds himself going into business with a desperate gay community as his clientele and a flamboyant drug-addicted transsexual named Rayon (an amazing Jared Leto) as his business partner traveling to Amsterdam Japan and Israel to buy the newest advances in AIDS drugs. Together this unspeakably mismatched odd couple establishes a Dallas buyers club made up of HIV-infected members who pay a 400 monthly fee for the latest treatments unapproved by the FDA. As a 30-day death sentence stretches into seven years of prolonged life Ron Woodroof learns what it feels like to be rejected and shunned by his own fellow roughnecks and becomes a leading authority on AIDS with an encyclopedic knowledge of the pandemic fighting the pharmaceutical companies the AMA FDA CIA and IRS in court for dignity education and human rights. Its the story of a lout who finds redemption through unexpected motivation becoming an accidental activist in the process and learning a valuable lesson in humanity about how to help others after its too late to help himself. Losing 50 pounds for the role Mr. McConaughey looks like a cadaver as he more than gives his all for his art. His shocking weight loss is the first thing youll notice but he grows on you in sensitivity and stature. Jennifer Garner is fine as the sympathetic doctor who risks her own career to help him. But it is Jared Leto--fearless funny openhearted sympathetic and totally believable as the transsexual who opens Woodroofs eyes to people and lifestyles he cannot begin to understand--who literally steals the picture. What a performance from an actor who grows in stature every time out of the starting gate. Meticulously researched by writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack (the actual Ron Woodroof was a consultant contributing hours of taped interviews before he died in 1992) and directed by Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee (Young Victoria) with a refreshing no-nonsense lack of sentiment Dallas Buyers Club represents the best of what independent film on a limited budget can achieve--powerful enlightening and not to be missed.

Conveniently--and a touch calculatingly--theyre all on display in the stirring Dallas Buyers Club a one-stop shop of the actors newfound fluidity. He starts off desperate and rascally hopping rodeo fences to escape gambling debts. Its a bleak sunbaked 1986 and Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) a bottom-scraping drug addict is about to hear the death sentence of an HIV-positive diagnosis. Out of the man comes a volley of homophobic vitriol and then tapping into the stars inviolable gift for comic timing theres an unlikely trip to the public library where some disheartening medical research provokes a scruffy rage explosion against the shushers. Only 20 minutes in and youre not going to think of another lead who could pull off this kind of reckoning--tangy furious and about to become whip-smart. The story is a real-life one Woodroof shocked local doctors not only by surviving many more years but also by evolving into an illegal drug importer a well-heeled operator and a provider of hope. Dallas Buyers Club fits our Breaking Bad moment perfectly offering a difficult hero whose personal code takes on an intriguing coherence. ""I like your style Hiroshi"" McConaughey coos to a Japanese supplier the movie arriving at its brainy peak. Working from a script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack that sometimes feels button-pushy Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallee expands the drama in a warm Demme-like direction lacing Woodroofs loose-limbed entrepreneurship with a strain of communal American grit. Jennifer Garners by-the-book M.D. and Jared Letos flamboyant business partner might have felt like mere devices had their scenes with McConaughey not pushed the plot toward feisty complications. Woodroof himself probably wouldnt call it a mission but thats the special takeaway of this film about how a higher purpose can sneak up on a shit-kicker in shades. Hes reborn ennobled by a crisis and in love with his new vocabulary. The change is both modest and monumental; we should all be so lucky as to have one.

Robert De Niros heavily mannered turn in Raging Bull just has to be great -- he gained 60 pounds for it didnt he? For his role in The Machinist Christian Bale dropped to a sub-skeletal 122 pounds; he looked like a walking talking Shroud of Turin. But the memory of his gaunt frame looms larger than any of the subtle shifts of expression or nuances of vocal tone he might have used to shape the performance. The body skinny or fat is one of an actors essential tools; it can also be a greedy scene-stealer. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Matthew McConaughey lost 40 pounds to play AIDS victim entrepreneur and ad-hoc activist Ron Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyers Club. His figure is so attenuated you can almost hear his bones cracking as he walks; his gait is that of a slow-motion alien his neck one long stretch of tendons a la E.T. But theres never a moment when you dont see the whole person. McConaugheys Ron Woodroof is a fully rounded ""yall go fuck yourselves"" folk hero and the space he takes up in the world is anything but the negative kind.Woodroof was a real person an electrician from Dallas who was diagnosed with HIV in 1985 -- hed contracted the virus from a forgotten heterosexual encounter -- and given 30 days to live. Dallas Buyers Club directed by Jean-Marc Vallee shows how Woodroof fought the illness Unable to partake in a clinical trial of the then-experimental AZT he began obtaining the drug through back channels. Eventually he began importing other drugs from Mexico and elsewhere selling them at a profit to those in need and also using them to keep himself alive. Previously Woodroof had seen AIDS as ""the gay disease."" But the more he learned about the virus and its possible treatments -- and the harder he worked to wriggle around FDA regulations -- the more he came to care about his fellow sufferers.Film DetailsCritics Pick Dallas Buyers Club RatingR GenreDrama Running Time117 More Info Whats remarkable about Dallas Buyers Club is its lack of sentimentality. The movie like its star is all angles and elbows earning its emotion through sheer pragmatism. Woodroof a man with a job to do enlists help from a number of acquaintances usually by first taking advantage of them. They include his physician Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) whos dismayed when she learns Woodroof is breaking the rules but who later shifts to his side and a fellow AIDS patient named Rayon (Jared Leto) a transsexual who in a marvelous scene manages to both charm and challenge the (at first) aggressively homophobic Woodroof. She beats the crap out of him in a card game played on his hospital bed; he refers to her as ""Miss Man"" an endearment wrapped around a jibe. They begin a business partnership that evolves into a friendship bickering like the Honeymooners all the way.Vallee whose previous credits include the melodrama Cafe de Flore and the historical romance The Young Victoria keeps a tight hold on the movies tone. Sometimes the picture works as a procedural Its fun in a vicarious way to watch Woodroof outwit the authorities at one point disguised as a comically convincing priest. Woodroofs methodology is heavily dependent on his scrawny-cowboy swagger his manner of dealing both with the people who stand in his way and with those he counts among his friends. McConaughey and Leto are wonderful in their scenes together Letos Rayon with her fluttery voice and even more fluttery hands makes a better Blanche DuBois stand-in than Cate Blanchett did in Blue Jasmine. Her vulnerability isnt just emotional and existential; its physical. When she wraps her dressing gown tight around her failing body its as if shes protecting all the womanly curves she knows she doesnt have.Woodroof is a great foil for her and though the two do more fighting than platonic cooing the bond between them is clear. Woodroof in the days before he got sick was a hard-drinking girl-chasing bull rider. But with Rayon hes always a gent -- his consideration for her is almost courtly. McConaughey can pull off that sort of thing One minute hes a cocky Marlboro Man; the next the stuttering cowpoke who shows up hat in hand at your weathered screen door for a first date. The real Woodroof outlived that 30-day death sentence by some seven years. (He died in 1992.) Late in the movie Dallas Buyers Clubs Woodroof after his body has been battered but not defeated clambers carefully onto the back of a bull thats eager to leap out of the gate. We can see McConaughey concentrating on this task as intently as Woodroof would have Who could risk a broken bone or even a bruise? But Woodroof manages to stay on the back of that crazy-mad snorting bull. To this mighty horned beast hes probably as light as a gnat and just as annoying. Sometimes thats how you get the job done.

By David Edelstein Published Oct 27 2013 ShareThis Jared Leto and Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club.  (Photo Anne Marie Fox/Courtesy of Focus Features) Matthew McConaughey doesnt work to anyone elses metronome which might be why he looked like he was slumming in a long stretch of so-so rom-coms that made him piles of money and also a joke. I dont think he was slumming; I think he has his own stubborn Texas timing (his dad is in the oil bidness) and wouldnt be rushed. He had to make his lines his own. At some point he got tired of the disrespect and started taking eccentric lower-paying parts in indie pictures like Bernie Killer Joe Magic Mike Mud and now Dallas Buyers Club for which he lost about a quarter of his body weight to play Ron Woodroof the rodeo cowboy electrician and (hetero) sex fiend who was stricken with HIV in 1985. McConaugheys hollows and protruding bones are scary to behold and they serve to set off the intensity of his performance. No one will accuse him of slumming here. His Woodroof is a man who doesnt just not want to die. He has a terror of passivity. Its unmanly. Its un-American. It makes a rodeo cowboy want to grab that bull by the horns. Despite its downbeat context (a plague at its height) the movie is a crowd-pleasergraceful and funny enough to distract you from its gaps and elisions. The Montreal-born director Jean-Marc Vallee clearly boned up on loose countercultural seventies pictures like Rancho Deluxe Payday and Buffalo Bill and the Indians. His framing is open his rhythm in sync with McConaugheysthe hard-partying good-ol-boy hustler who happens in this case to be on the side of the angels. The movies main thread is Woodroofs desperate attemptafter being told he has 30 days to liveto find alternative sources of treatment. First he bribes a hospital orderly for AZT which is still in trials. Then he chances on a U.S. ex-doctor (license revoked) in a Mexican clinic who has a different more holistic regime. Screenwriters Craig Borten and Melissa Wallack embrace the theory that high doses of AZT in the mid-eighties killed people as fast as aids did and that government agencies took their cues from the pharmaceutical company rather than physicians and patients on the front lines. So Woodroof becomes a countercultural hero by bringing non-approved meds over the border and selling them out of two rooms in a ramshackle Dallas motel. The secondary thread is the sentimental clincher how a flagrant Texas homophobe ([Rock] Hudson was a cocksucker All that Hollywood pussy being wasted) comes to like and then stand up for the LGBT community. Woodroofs chief ally is an alluring transvestite named Rayon played by Jared Leto whod make anyone rethink his or her prejudices. Its difficult to talk about the beauty of Letos performance because he just well is. The transformation is so completephysically and vocallythat its hard to believe he could ever be anything else. Rayon (nee Raymond) is high on being Rayon to the point where you sometimes forget that hes dying too. (One of the films best scenes is one in which Rayon dons an ill-fitting suit and tie to beg for money from his estranged father.) Vallee cites the documentary How to Survive a Plague as an inspiration for the scenes in which Woodroof Rayon and their allies take on the FDA (and the FBI DEA and IRS) to create in effect an alternative universe. Theyve been left with no recourse Its break the law or die. The question is open whether Dallas Buyers Club plays fair. The people who rushed AZT through its trials were responding to a plague unlike any in modern history and the drug is stillin lower dosespart of the cocktail that has kept hundreds of thousands of people alive. The filmmakers do acknowledge AZTs rolebut in an end title that comes as a shock after watching our heroes exhort aids sufferers to throw the drug into the toilet. (Is that title there for legal reasons?) And in the course of Woodroofs trips around the world to procure more meds the film doesnt hint at the universe of quacks and scam artists selling false cures. Who ran the trials abroad? Were mortality rates lower in countries where these remedies were legal? And how reliable was Woodroofs 30-days-to-death diagnosis to begin with? You can accept the movies thrust and still wonder if something has been left out. As a doctor whos appalled by those AZT trials Jennifer Garner gets a lot of scenes in which she vainly challenges the physician in charge (Denis OHare) and then returns to her desk and fumes Will she shut up and follow orders or throw in her lot with the outlaws? Its not a well-shaped role but Ive gotten to the point where Im happy to see Garner in anything. Shes incapable of phoniness. Griffin Dunne is irresistibleand barely recognizableas the hairy unkempt doctor in Mexico whos convinced that AZT destroys everything (bad and good) in its path. Kevin Rankin shows up as another redneck sleazeball (this year alone he menaced Walt and Jesse in Breaking Bad and the free world in White House Down) this time a buddy of Woodroofs who gets smacked down when he impugns Rayons humanity. Its a scene that gladdens the heart. Who better than a macho cowboy to put a homophobe definitively in his place? 1 2 Next Share this story...

"Toronto Film Festival Diary Oscar Tyranny Andre 3000 as Jimi Hendrix and Our Lord and Savior Matthew McConaughey << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Toronto Film Festival Diary Oscar Tyranny Andre 3000 as Jimi Hendrix and Our Lord and Savior Matthew McConaughey Michael Buckner/Getty Academy Awards September 9 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print When this vast important film festival -- street name ""TIFF"" -- moved its hub to downtown Toronto it was a win. The streets are smaller. The food is better. And so are the multiplexes and nightlife. There are also fewer businesspeople to trip over and protests to avoid. (Im not kidding I have missed the start of many a movie because of some worthy-cause march.) The festival built itself the TIFF Bell Lightbox which is in use year-round as a state-of-the-art moviegoing facility. Most years I leave sad Im not Torontonian. But I think the downtown luster has begun to tarnish. Theres been an increase in pushing and waiting and general glut. The enormous lobby of the Scotiabank Theatre with its 15 screens can become stressfully full inexplicably fast. Its now possible to be turned away from a movie before even securing a spot in the queue. In the past Ive waited an hour on the street for the line to enter the theater to budge. (Last year the line for The Master began to move in a direction charitably characterized as counterproductive.) Previous Toronto Film Festival Diaries Day 1 Cumberbitching About Freedom of Information in The Fifth Estate The sad brutal irony of all these queues -- for both public and press-and-industry screenings -- is that often theyre for movies that have not only secured distribution but have imminent opening dates. Prisoners for instance will be in theaters everywhere on September 20 but the crush to claim one of the 557 available seats suggested a one-night-only happening. TIFF is an exhaustively international thrillingly inclusive event one of multiple personalities -- Hollywood premieres microscopic works of art avant-gardism hits from Cannes the pathological earnestness that remains the defining characteristic of Canadian cinema. Once upon a time those facets were harmonized. But Oscar-mania has hijacked the festival. One of this years promotions brags that last year TIFF invited each of the five future best foreign-language nominees. If the festival programmed only five movies that would certainly be impressive but there were more than 400 movies here last year. Toronto-as-awards-season-bellwether is a pernicious airborne germ and by the start of the festival half the city comes down with it. Ive heard everyone from members of Toronto Pearson International Airports grounds crew to entertainment bloggers speculate about which movies have what odds. Vultures Kyle Buchanan bolted from a screening of Steve McQueens 12 Years a Slave with Chiwetel Ejiofor Michael Fassbender and Brad Pitt and declared the Oscar race over. The ensuing outrage chastised Buchanans proclamation for being either obnoxiously premature or lacking critical insight. Some of that outrage was just about Buchanan beating his peers to their punch. In any case that increasingly is Toronto now a bellwether that can you leave with tinnitus. The ring overtakes you and you wind up in a hilariously long line to watch Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in Alfonso Cuarons Gravity or Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club. Youre infected with the need to see tomorrows Oscar winners today. Never mind that thats a truly toxic lens through which to watch a movie. I actually got out of the Sunday afternoon line for the Cuaron even though Im desperate to see it. Instead I was seduced by the idea of Andre 3000 as Jimi Hendrix. John Ridleys All Is by My Side is almost very good a work of beautiful impressionism that at the moment has no U.S. distributor but deserves one. The movie focuses on the year Hendrix spent in England before he gave a legendary performance in 1967 at the Monterey Pop Festival. Ridley is a novelist and screenwriter and essayist. Hes been in and around Hollywood a long time and is determined to treat Hendrix better than Hollywood movies tend to treat icons as elements in a formula. This is less a work of movie biography and more a narcotic exhalation. The Hendrix it presents is both a dreamy magician of a guitarist and a disaster as a conductor of what little self-promotional ambition he had. His talent needed others to steer him fameward. But even when hes pointed in the right direction hes lost. Ridley enhances that sense of dislocation. He layers the soundtrack and the images so that the movie seems to be on the assortment of stimulants -- sex dope love -- that keep Hendrix strung out. The movie is as much about the women in Hendrixs life as the music -- here there are at least three women -- and his complicated relationship with one in particular Kathy Etchingham played by Hayley Atwell. Its possible Ridley was too determined to break the rules. For a film that seems awfully focused on Hendrix getting his fix its fix on Hendrix is almost comically vague. The trauma of his troubled childhood is present but underexplored as the root of his druggy childish demeanor and Andre 3000s performance oddly refracts Hendrix through his own country demeanor. Theres a twang to this Jimi and a defensive wonder about him too. Andre is smaller than Jimi and his sexual charisma more impish. But hes light with Hendrixs fundamental spaciness and heavy with his melancholy. His turbulent Afro becomes mood hair. But whats really missing here is Hendrixs own music. Whether its absence is a strategic subversion or a problem of licensing it leaves a crater in a movie that Ridleys formal cleverness cant entirely fill. Hendrix recorded some of his most famous songs (""Purple Haze"" ""Hey Joe"" Foxy Lady"") during the period the film spends with him. This is the most artistically interesting American movie Ive seen since the festival started. Yet without the music the movie gives the feeling that youve watched some alternate-universe version of its star. When in Canada and unable to see a Canadian film (even one by a Canadian filmmaker you love like say the 24-year-old drama queen Xavier Dolan) the next best thing should be a film based on the work of a great Canadian writer. If that writer is Alice Munro and the movie is Hateship Loveship its best to try harder to see the Dolan. This movie doesnt so much relocate the title story from Munros 2001 collection Hateship Friendship Courtship Loveship Marriage as dislocate it to the U.S. The dislocation is emotional too. Just look at Kristen Wiigs face. In an attempt to perform Munros scrupulous interiority Wiig seems body-snatched. She plays Johanna the live-in caretaker of a teenager (Hailee Steinfeld). The girls best friend (Sami Gayle who nails breezy bitchery) plays a prank on Johanna that leaves her obsessed with the girls jailbird father (Guy Pearce). Liza Johnson directed this movie. Mark Poirier adapted it. And the films chummy tone suggests a willful misunderstanding of Munros melancholy. Im afraid the movie thinks its tidy dismount is a kind of happy ending. But those last scenes manage to be accidentally depressing about women and happiness. Its warm but small-minded and one thing Munro is not cute. I did actually see Dallas Buyers Club. I went in fully apprehensive about spending two hours with a decaying Matthew McConaughey. He plays Ron Woodroof a party-hearty homophobic electrician diagnosed with HIV in the mid-1980s. The movie jumps right from his doctors (Jennifer Garner and Denis OHare) telling him hes got 30 days to live to a black screen that reads ""Day 1"" to a sequence in which hes goes on another super-bender. Its right about here that I thought ""Yeah I dont want to watch this"" by which I meant that I didnt want to see the AIDS version of Leaving Las Vegas. But it turns out Woodroof was a real guy and he wanted to live. And so the movie relents on the misery and turns in a kind of dramatic comedy. Woodroof winds up fighting to sell non-FDA-approved drug cocktails to the sick. This film comes out in November. Until then Ill just say that its alarming to see McConaugheys rooster persona lose its feathers. Its a vain masochistic performance but hes just as committed to the comedy in the movie which Jean-Marc Vallee directed and Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack wrote as he is to the social and personal crises. Whats disappointing is how the film takes a story of American opportunity and boxes it into a conventional formula putting a straight white guy on the front line of the AIDS crisis. The only gay character of any substance is Ye Olde Sassy Junkie-Drag Queen played by Jared Leto. His character helps Woodroof run his drug-cocktail subscription business. This might be the safest sad movie you can ever hope to see about a man who smokes and fucks with unrepentant zeal. You dont begrudge its existence because it will open peoples minds and remind people that AIDS was a crisis for all sexual orientations. Hes standing up to medical malpractice government bureaucracy and bigotry. Even so Dallas Buyers Club also perpetuates the same myths the movies always do That only the Matthew McConaugheys of the world are capable of making it better. In life Woodroof who lived six years past his prognosis became a shrewd and enlightened businessman who brought unique attention to the AIDS fight. The movie adds vulgar emotional sweetener. Its Erin Cockovich.

The emaciated actor playing a straight man who just learned he has AIDS glares at his doctor and fires back that theres no way hes got ""that Rock-cock-sucking-Hudson bullshit."" The actor who shed nearly a quarter of his body weight for the role makes clear the artificial nature of his performance from the outset then spends most of the movie strengthening its credibility. To its credit ""Dallas Buyers Club"" provides McConaughey with sufficient room to gradually make his onscreen persona more palatable but like the characters battle to survive its no easy proposition. Based on the true life story of Ron Woodruff a Texan electrician diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 ""Dallas Buyers Club"" covers the immediate aftermath of Woodruffs diagnosis which initially arrived with the expectation that he would be dead within a month even though he lived another seven years. Facing impossible odds for the time Woodruff fought to get his hands on unapproved experimental medications and eventually got in the business of selling it to other ailing locals. Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee from Craig Borten and Melisa Wallacks script the movie emphasizes Woodruffs transition from spiteful trailer trash cliche to medical activist a little too bluntly though Vallee largely counteracts that issue with a noticeably restrained tone that foregrounds McConaugheys increasingly believable embodiment of the character. Vallee whose last credit was the ambitious French language time-hopping drama ""Cafe de Flore"" directs this scenario with a straightforward approach that may not realize the full dramatic weight of the situation but generally sidesteps potential issues that arise with a heterosexual perspective that downplays its homosexual characters. Rather than engaging with the greater issues of the AIDS epidemic plaguing the country at the same time that Woodruff faces his predicament ""Dallas Buyers Club"" merely hints at the bigger picture. Mainly it sticks to Woodruffs transition Starting out as a mean-spirited philanderer he gradually softens up under dire circumstances. The chief emotional pull comes from the way he initially rejects others help and eventually decides to join their cause. McConaughey makes Woodruffs commitment into the central engine of the drama. Initially seen as a hustler who wastes his days ripping people off at rodeos and screwing every woman in his orbit he funnels that same energy into his fight even though hes a newbie to its cause. ""Screw the FBA"" he says flubbing the acronym FDA when told that the medicine he wants hasnt been approved. ""Ive got a DOA."" Woodruffs rising business prospects provide sufficient content for an increasingly involving drama as his dealings find him not only seeding the needs of the Dallas AIDS community but also traveling around the world in search of more unlicensed drugs. Unfortunately most of the other personalities surrounding the scheme lack the same sharp definition. As the tender-hearted doctor initially divided over his cause before taking a radical stance of her own Jennifer Garner delivers a basic unadventurous performance that suffers from being in the shadow of McConaugheys complex achievement. Jared Leto technically faces an even more daunting undertaking with his portrayal of Rayon the angst-riddled transsexual driven to become Woodruffs business partner. But while Rayon is a believably irritable outcast hes given only a handful of scenes to broaden the plots focus. For better or worse ""Dallas Buyers Club"" foregrounds Woodruffs struggles above all else. But if youre willing to accept that hes the only true star the movie eloquently pits his wild-eyed early days when he smuggles the ineffectual drug AZT out of the hospital and chases it with beer and coke against the considerably more empathetic and tolerant man seen in the final act. After meeting an underground doctor south of the border (a wry Griffin Dunne) Woodruff finds the ideal partner in crime to enable his scheme. Its easy to get swept up their cause and only consider its limited vision in hindsight. Shot with a gritty naturalism that draws out the Western dimensions of the setting ""Dallas Buyers Club"" matches Woodruffs tough situation with an equally dour atmosphere. The narrative only really stumbles because its tone never manages to convince on the level that McConaugheys performance eventually does. With its subdued approach ""Dallas Buyers Club"" stops just short of an emotional payoff. But thats a relatively innocuous problem considering that it manages to navigate the possibility of a far more troubling issue -- marginalizing its gay characters ""Dallas Buyers Club"" finds them rescued by a messianic straight man. The only time Vallee overplays this possibility in gratuitous fashion he shows Woodruff discovering a roomful of moths and allows them to cover his body as they were millions of souls rescued by his efforts. Its the single moment where ""Dallas Buyers Club"" jumps the shark; for the majority of the time it wrestles with the heavy material like the cowboys and cattle at the rodeo that frames its events and McConaughey proves himself a proficient rider. Criticwire grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? Focus Features plans to release ""Dallas Buyers Club"" on November 1 in the heat of the fall awards season.

Dowd and Ben Kenigsberg Sep 8 2013 1206 PM Share Tweet Share Tweet As an excuse for Emmanuel Lubezki to rotate his camera through a bunch of cool-looking 3-D space hardware Alfonso Cuarons Gravity (Grade B-) does its job spectacularly. In narrative terms though its somewhat lacking essentially counting on viewers to be so lulled by gorgeous refractions of light and insane long takes a la Children Of Men that they wont care about dramatic anemia or missed opportunities for tension. The setup is simple. A collision with hurtling detritus leaves astronauts Sandra Bullock and George Clooney the sole survivors of a space station catastrophe bobbing and weaving through the darkness. Visually immersive without being consistently involving Gravity like Avatar revels in its own virtuosity. Every scene aspires to be the ""open the pod bay door HAL"" sequence in 2001 A Space Odyssey as the scientists struggle to stay tethered to each other and to board what remains of their vessels. Still some of the hallmarks of Kubricks movie--the eerie silence the painstaking pacing--are in short supply. Cueing the viewer with a heavy-handed score Cuaron rarely slows the proceedings down long enough to generate lengthy suspense. The movie presents its characters with one challenge after another but doesnt take a breath to give the audience its bearings. Apollo 13 presented a more richly detailed space-rescue operation; the screenplay kept viewers acutely aware of say the condensation on electrical panels or which switches need to be pushed at a given time. Watching Gravity often feels like watching an especially long prep reel for Star Tours without ever being allowed to board the ride. Its true that the film--human-scaled technically precise inventive in its stereoscopy--represents a less depressing future-of-cinema scenario than Pacific Rims tedious gigantism but its a decidedly mixed bag. When it comes to capturing actors on film the aggressive 3-D makes Gravity look slightly cheesy. Clooney brings his usual insouciance to the task at hand but Bullock saddled with a too-pat back story doesnt convey the psychological depths her character requires. This is a case of technology put to expert use but one fears a future in which Hollywood decides to dispense with the humans entirely. Those who say television is the future of cinema might struggle make their case on the basis of the miniseries Southcliffe (Grade C) written by veteran miserablist Tony Grisoni (Red Riding The Unloved) and directed--though not with much of an apparent signature--by Martha Marcy May Marlenes Sean Durkin. The film chronicles life in the eponymous factious British town before during and after a shooting spree an event initially relayed obliquely. The first two of four chapters play tricks with chronology as a means of keeping viewers off-balance. Despite that suspense-goosing measure Southcliffe doesnt become compelling until the third of four episodes--though even then as Rory Kinnears Southcliffe-raised London-based TV reporter is drunkenly shouting that the town deserved what it got the movie has safely left the realm of common sense. Some affecting turns (by Shirley Henderson and especially Eddie Marsan as a grieving couple) salvage some of it but the film is an unilluminating--and with its unvaried palette of gray tones under-illuminated--wallow in grief. Another film about witnessing tragedy the JFK assassination drama Parkland (Grade C+) received some vicious pans at Venice; the title refers to the Dallas Hospital to which Kennedy was rushed after being shot which is also where Oswald died a few days later. The obvious comparison is Emilio Estevezs Bobby (2006) which similarly observed a cross-section of 60s America on the eve of RFKs assassination. But the crucial difference here is that the persons onscreen from Billy Bob Thorntons Secret Service agent to the young trauma doctor played by Zac Efron to Paul Giamattis suddenly besieged Abraham Zapruder are all directly involved with the aftermath of the murder. The feature directing debut of journalist-turned filmmaker Peter Landesman its not the best-made procedural heavy on cheap irony (""Nice day for a motorcade"" Ron Livingstons FBI agent exclaims at the beginning because who didnt say that that morning?) and overplaying tacky angles as James Badge Dale (playing Oswalds brother) is warned hell have to change his name and skip town. But theres still a morbid fascination in seeing these events play out from the immediate periphery whether its in watching agents decide how to load Kennedys coffin onto the Air Force One (hastily removing rows of seats) or learning where the Zapruder film was developed (a Kodak lab on the edge of town which was ill-equipped for 8mm--imagine if the footage had been overexposed). Tolerance for variable acting is a must; Thornton provides some gravitas as an agent who feels hes failed in his mission while Jacki Weaver as Oswalds mother gives perhaps the shrillest performance since the Kennedy administration. Much more current--maybe too current--is The Square (Grade C+) which really requires a provisional grade. This documentary from Jehane Noujaim (Control Room) observes the Arab Spring from the vantage point of activists in Tahrir Square capturing their changing perspectives as the government and constitution evolve. But upheaval in Egypt is very much ongoing--and even more than with The Fifth Estate this is a film in danger of being rendered dated by headlines at any moment. Edited until just before the festival--theres footage from Morsis ouster this summer plus title cards filling us in on August--the film is valuable for its ground-level view of a movement that the American cable news too often abstracts into facelessness. But the film seems scattered in search of a defined subject. As actor-activist Khalid Abdalla (The Kite Runner) explains on-screen it wont be possible to gauge the effects of the events in Egypt for decades--which leaves any filmmaker who wants to make a documentary on the subject in a bind. At a certain point a movie has to be finished and released especially if it might spur change. But it doesnt seem like this story has a clear upshot yet--or at least a cutoff that would allow Noujaim to focus the footage more clearly. In a cool development the Qamp;A following the screening adjourned to an alley around the corner from the theater where the filmmakers joined by a healthy crowd attempted (unsuccessfully) to contact another of the subjects Ahmed Hassan in Egypt via Skype as theyd done after an earlier screening. This time theyd prepared to project his image onto the bottom of mattress leaning against the alley wall. It didnt work but the scene was something else. The Square is grassroots activism first cinema second--and theres nothing wrong with that. --Ben Kenigsberg When it comes to festival coverage I subscribe to the perhaps antiquated notion that its not so important to be among the very first to weigh in on a buzzed-about title. Entertainment journalists thrive on getting the scoop and on feeling as though theyre ""shaping the conversation"" but waiting just a little longer--say an extra 24 hours--can help assuage the nagging temptation to align oneself instantly with the pro or con camps. Or maybe thats just my rationale for not wanting to brave the madhouse crowds of a Gala premiere. Either way while many of my peers spent yesterday watching debating or getting shut out of screenings of Alfonso Cuarons Gravity I was still catching up with the previous days major talking point Steve McQueens harrowing historical drama 12 Years A Slave (Grade A-) the episodic true tale of a free black man in upstate New York circa 1841 whos kidnapped and sold into the Southern plantation system. Whats not being widely acknowledged about the movie is that its not just the best feature McQueen has yet made but also--for all its unflinching brutality--also his most conventionally satisfying. Dont let me be misunderstood Theres nothing middlebrow about the film which tackles the nightmare of American slavery without sentimentality nor with the need to provide comeuppance or catharsis. Arriving less than a year after Tarantinos crass Django Unchained which trivialized the subject by treating its horrors as the catalyst for a kicky revenge fable 12 Years A Slave has a starkness that belies its status as an instant ""Oscar frontrunner."" Yet when held up against McQueens other pictures the Bobby Sands biopic Hunger and the sex addiction drama Shame this new one looks undeniably classical in construction. It is first and foremost a triumph of storytelling one less concerned with inspiring awe through aesthetics than investing viewers in its narrative. While those previous efforts found McQueen gazing upon his subjects from a remove his interest devoted more clearly to surfaces than psychology 12 Years A Slave erases the emotional distance between the filmmaker and his protagonist.  There are less showboating set-pieces--a few long single takes but no epic ones--because those would largely distract from the devastating understatement of Chiwetel Ejiofors lead performance. I tend to side with my colleague in his assertion that the film is best appreciated as a penetrating character study; to ascribe a grand historical agenda to its litany of sorrows is to rob it of its specificity. In any case whether one takes 12 Years A Slave as the definitive big-screen treatment of slavery or just a tough wounding vision of what one man is willing to do to survive theres no denying what it represents for its creator. Before our eyes a talented craftsman has transformed into a gifted storyteller. Strong acting was a through line in my third day at TIFF Besides 12 Years A Slave--which boasts great work from just about everyone onscreen including a tender Benedict Cumberbatch and a loathsome Paul Dano (who takes his most deserved beating since There Will Be Blood)--all of the high-profile American movies I caught on Saturday benefitted from the commitment of their stars. In yet another of his mid-career knockout performances Matthew McConaughey gets scary Machinist thin to play real-life Texas electrician Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyers Club (Grade B). A homophobic good old boy with a taste for unprotected sex Woodroof contracted HIV in 1986; shunned by his friends and given 30 days to live by his doctors he ended up setting up an alternative medication ring for his fellow afflicted smuggling unapproved drugs into the country while the FDA was pushing the lethal AZT on the dying. As with too many biopics Dallas Buyers Club detrimentally attempts to conform its true story to dramatic conventions setting up a quasi-romance between McConaughey and doctor Jennifer Garner and establishing boo-and-hiss-worthy villains in Woodroofs battle with the government and pharmaceutical companies. Yet theres still something undeniably moving about the films trajectory which allows McConaughey to blossom into an empathetic figure--one whose homophobia fades as his fighting spirit intensifies--without losing his rapscallion spirit. Hes an indelible character around which to base a movie. Lingering sentimentality may be partially responsible for the good reviews bestowed upon Nicole Holofceners Enough Said (Grade B) which features the penultimate performance from the late great James Gandolfini. Truthfully though this is one of Holofceners better efforts largely because it eases up on the first-world problems she normally mines for comedic material. (A subplot involving the difficulty of firing a maid is the lone unfortunate exception.) Theres something more universal about this story of a single mother and middle-aged masseuse (Julia Louis-Dreyfus charming) who starts dating a fellow divorcee (Gandolfini) only to discover that hes the ex-husband her new friend and client (Catherine Keener) has been endlessly bitching about. Thats a fairly contrived sitcom scenario but Holofcener bends it into a loose lightly funny meditation on divorce getting older and impending empty-nest syndrome. Also yes Gandolfini is terrific. Things got weirder yesterday evening when I capped a day of American movies with two oddball international selections. Im still not entirely sure what to make of Celestial Wives Of The Meadow Mari (Grade B-) a bizarre blend of Russian folklore and sex comedy that unfolds over 23 vignettes of varying hilarity and grotesqueness. Director Alexey Fedorchenko who made the elegiac ethnographic drama Silent Souls has an eye for striking imagery and an admirable interest in disappearing customs. But Celestial Wives often feels like little more than a string of bawdy-surreal gags as though Apichatpong Weerasethakul had mounted a remake of Movie 43. (I know that sounds awesome and to the right eyes it might be.) Also some of the segments are just plain gross. See or maybe dont see the scene in which mischievous male spirits throw cups of jizz at the dancing girls who summoned them. Much more compelling though also exhausting was The Strange Colour Of Your Bodys Tears (Grade B) which finds Amer directors Helene Cattet and Bruno Forzani still gloriously riffing on the stylistic hallmarks of giallo. To both its benefit and eventual detriment this new one attempts to apply the duos nonstop virtuoso tricks to an honest-to-God narrative a mans search for the wife who disappeared from his forebodingly swanky French apartment building. The problem here isnt that Cattet and Forzani slice and dice their story into near abstraction; Amer did that too which was one of the things that made it such a pure-cinema delight. Strange Colour simply suffers from an excess of material; after a while the swirling camera moves split screen still-image violence deafening sonic assault and endless close-ups (of red lips leather-glad hands knives razors and lots and lots of eyeballs) becomes a little numbing. Until then however--and breaking points will vary--it feels like the most visually dazzling film of the fest. --A.A.

The Toronto International Film Festival is full of these fact-based movies Mandela 12 Years a Slave (19th-century free black Solomon Northup) The Fifth Estate (Julian Assange) Rush (race car rivals James Hunt and Niki Lauda) The Railway Man (Japanese torture camp survivor Eric Lomax) and Parkland (tracing the events at a Dallas hospital on Nov. 22 1963). From the antebellum American South to modern South Africa from World War II to WikiLeaks from JFK to Formula 1 inspirational or just informational historical dramas are crowding the Toronto schedule this year. Actually this year and every year -- because TIFF is a showcase for Oscar-wannabe films and nothing appeals to the members of the Motion Picture Academy quite so much as a true story rouged into a stirring drama. Since 2000 bio-pics have accounted for 21 of the Best Picture nominees and two of the last three winners The Kings Speech and Argo. The genre is even more generous to performers. Seven of the past 11 Best Actor awards and eight Best Actresses have gone to people playing real people. These winners have portrayed heads of state (Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II Colin Firth as King George VI Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin Dada) prime ministers and presidents (Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln) novelists (Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote) and popular singers (Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles). Its a hallowed Academy tradition rewarding the famous for playing the famous. (READ Toronto and the Lust for Oscar) So whats so special about Ron Woodroof the working-class Texan play by Matthew McConaughey in Jean-Marc Vallees grittily uplifting Dallas Buyers Club? Hes just a Texas electrician a hard partier and drug user a part-time rodeo rider and serial homophobe who in 1985 learned he had contracted HIV (from sex with a drug-using woman). Told he had 30 days to live and that AZT was the only drug that might stabilize his condition Woodroof first paid a hospital employee to steal the stuff. Then when one doctor warned him that ""The only people AZT helps are the people selling it"" he researched treatments that the Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved. ""Screw the FDA"" he tells the medical establishment ""Im gonna be DOA."" [SPOILER ALERT Though most reviews have spilled the well-known facts of Woodroofs life and though you may want to know what the films title refers to we urge anyone planning to see the film to skip this paragraph.] Traveling the world to find more promising drugs he established the Dallas Buyers Club whose members -- mostly gays with HIV or full-blown AIDS -- paid Woodroof for access to the pharmaceuticals that could prolong their lives. Like the Old Dope Peddler in Tom Lehrers song this good ole boy did well by doing good. Woodroof lived for six years after his initial death notice and some of the drugs he found and sold were later proved to be of help to AIDS patients. [END SPOILER ALERT.] (SEE -- but maybe dont look at -- this too-revealing trailer for Dallas Buyers Club) If anyone associated with Dallas Buyers Club is famous its McConaughey who lost way too much weight for the role. Vallee on stage at the TIFF premiere said ""almost 50 pounds."" Thirty-eight is the official number but either way McConaughey wasnt exactly a fatty to begin with. Actors as we all know are nuts; theyll do anything for a role including punishing their bodies. Robert De Niro gained 60 pounds to play the older Jake LaMotta in Martin Scorseses 1980 Raging Bull and Christian Bale dropped 62 pounds (from 182 to 120) for his lead in the 2004 The Machinist. McConaugheys weight loss -- in the film he looks even gaunter and more ghostly than photos of the real Ron Woodroof -- follows those spectacular stunts and provides as rich an emotional and artistic payoff as De Niros. This is a bold drastic and utterly persuasive inhabiting of a doomed fighter by a performer who has graduated from the shirtless rom-com Romeo of the last decade to indie-film actor du jour. His turns as a more reckless Dallas dude in Killer Joe as the strip-club showman in Magic Mike as a Texas D.A. in Bernie and as the lovelorn outlaw in Mud have led up to this the apogee of an adventurous career change. (Blessedly in Dallas Buyers Club we never see the emaciated Matthew with his shirt off.) Most of these roles run subversive variations on the wastrel charmer he played in The Wedding Planner How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. The salesman patter of his musical voice remains but it is directed to darker more toxic ends. (READ Corliss on the pre-serious Matthew McConaughey) Early in Dallas Buyers Club written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack Woodroof coarsely ingests the news of the first celebrity AIDS death  ""Did you know Rock Hudson was a c--s---r?"" The lesson for Ron and many Americans was not that a new disease was killing people but that a romantic Hollywood star was gay. He dismisses his diagnosis because hes not queer and insults the homosexuals at a meeting of HIV victims. Only when his coworkers hear of his illness and paint the words FAGGOT BLOOD in red paint on the side of his house does Ron realize he has more in common with the gays he despises than with his old pals. Ron had recoiled from a transvestite druggie named Rayon (Jared Leto) when he occupied the hospital bed next to Rons. But who homophile or homophobe could resist the winsome Rayon? In a role that shares and almost seizes the films emotional center Leto captures the sweet intensity and almost saintly good humor of a glamorous poignant and downright divoon creature -- a blithe Camille who may surrender her health but never her panache. Interrupting his movie career to write songs and tour with his band Thirty Seconds to Mars Leto returns with a superb performance. At the TIFF premiere he noted that ""it was five years more like six"" between films adding with a flirtatious smile. ""How can you miss me if I never go away?"" (READ Corliss on Jared Leto in Requiem for a Dream) Borten and Wallack based their script on hundreds of hours of interviews with Woodroof then waited 20 years for the film to get made. Marc Forster was to direct Brad Pitt as Ron; Ryan Gosling was to star for director Craig Gillespie. The job finally went to Vallee the French-Canadian director of the bright coming-of-age comedy C.R.A.Z.Y. the stately period piece The Young Victoria and best of all the swooningly romantic Cafe de Flore. Having made films in Quebec London and Paris Vallee quickly accommodated himself to urban Texas (played by New Orleans). Every scene seems lived-in with a natives familiarity and a foreigners eye for the telling detail. (READ Mary Corlisss review of Jean-Marc Vallees Cafe de Flore) Vallee gets excellent work from Steve Zahn as Rons brother Griffin Dunne as a kindly uncertified medico in Mexico (he looks like Jerry Garcia with a stethoscope) and Jennifer Garner as basically the good doctor who seeks new drugs for HIV and AIDS patients. (Denis OHare takes one for the team by playing the bad doctor who wont give up his pharma grants and keeps pushing AZT.) If the camera occasionally suffers a fashionable case of the jitters the movie transcends its agitated verismo to impart dramatic and behavioral truth. In a crowded field of based-on-a-true-story films at Toronto Dallas Buyers Club is the real thing.

On the heels of the acclaimed and powerful documentaries ""We Were Here"" and the Oscar-nominated ""How to Survive a Plague"" we now get the docudrama ""Dallas Buyers Club"" about one of many grassroots efforts to get non-FDA-approved drugs and supplements to terminally ill patients. Its been 20 years since ""Philadelphia"" the last movie to feature a handsome beloved movie star as a person with AIDS and it doesnt feel like mainstream cinema has gotten very far with the topic. If ""Philadelphia"" was the ""Guess Whos Coming to Dinner"" of AIDS ""Dallas Buyers Club"" proves that all this time later were still on the first course. Also read Captain Phillips Review Taut Suspense Iffy Racial Politics Unfussy Tom Hanks The movie is another powerful showcase for Matthew McConaughey whose winning streak of excellent performances continues unabated but his character and the way he plays him far outshines the rest of the film which feels more ""truthy"" than true with plenty of convenient composite characters and cardboard bad guys. McConaughey stars as Ron Woodroof a character whos got nowhere to go but up from the films opening sequence in which he has sex with a pair of floozies unleashes a torrent of homophobic and racist insults runs off with stolen betting money and punches his cop friend (played by Steve Zahn) in order to escape a mob of angry gamblers in police custody. An accident at work sends Ron to the hospital where blood tests indicate hes HIV-positive and has almost no T-cells left. Doctors tell him he has 30 days to live but Ron bribes a hospital janitor to steal AZT for him. That infamously toxic drug which was for several years the only medication given to HIV/AIDS patients nearly does him in but an unlicensed MD (Griffin Dunne) in Mexico saves Ron with a regimen of unapproved medications supplements and protein injections. Realizing that terminal patients are starved for AZT alternatives legal or not Ron starts the Dallas Buyers Club; to avoid getting prosecuted for selling drugs Ron gives them away -- to the people who can afford the monthly membership dues. With the help of ailing drag queen Rayon (Jared Leto) and local doctor Eve (Jennifer Garner) Ron is able to offer new treatment possibilities to hundreds of clients all under the watchful eye of the FDA. Also read Salinger Review A Compelling Portrait of a Literary Man of Mystery (Video) This true story is a fascinating one but writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack awkwardly dice the tale into such bite-sized nuggets that were basically left with one jerk doctor (Denis OHare) who keeps pushing AZT even when its obvious that its hurting patients and one dogged FDA bureaucrat (Michael ONeill) who always seems to be hovering around Ron whether its in Dallas or at the Mexican border. (Texas is really really big yall so its unlikely this one guy would have such a large jurisdiction.) The best thing ""Dallas Buyers Club"" has to offer is Ron both on paper and as portrayed by McConaughey. The script captures this good ol boy suddenly stricken with a disease he associates exclusively with gay men (theres a prostitute-with-track-marks flashback) and as he goes through his journey he doesnt magically get cured of his small-mindedness. Apart from one scene where he physically forces one of his old friends to shake Rayons hand Ron continually bristles at anything he perceives as gay; he just does it less so as the film goes on. Admittedly theres something problematic about a movie featuring a hero of the AIDS crisis whos a white heterosexual male. But since HIV/AIDS has so often been portrayed as a problem of ""others"" be they gays or people of color theres something almost subversive about playing it this safe providing a hero whos palatable to studio execs and then forcing him to live and work with people he has spent most of his life shunning. Every character who isnt Ron alas feels like an amalgam of several real-life people and each one gets one or two defining traits apiece if that. Leto pours his heart into playing a cross-dressing junkie but the performance is ultimately too surface-level and self-satisfied; I know some Dallas drag queens Mr. Leto and you are no Dallas drag queen. (Leto does it should be noted strongly resemble Zooey Deschanel when wearing a brown curly wig and sunglasses.) Despite her own best efforts Garners doctor comes off as little more than a plot device despite some tacked-on flirtation scenes with Ron. Like McConaugheys recent ""Killer Joe"" this is a Dallas-set movie filmed instead in the more tax-friendly climes of New Orleans and theres a definite lack of geographical specificity for a movie whose title proclaims its supposed location. Points however to the crew member who dug up an old T-shirt for GUTS (Gay Urban Truth Squad Dallas version of ACT UP in the 1980s). Yes McConaughey lost a lot of weight for the role but his work here transcends mere physical transformation. Whether hes boozing and snorting his way through the Kubler-Ross stages (denial anger bargaining et. al.) or disguising himself as a priest or a doctor to make his way through customs the actor captures both the characters shadiness and his dogged determination to go on living. (The real Woodruff outlasted his doctors 90-day prognosis by nearly 2500 days.) McConaughey is the only reason to see ""Dallas Buyers Club"" but hes enough of a reason to see ""Dallas Buyers Club.""

Any doubt that still exists in audiences minds as to Matthew McConaugheys talents as an actor are permanently put to rest by ""Dallas Buyers Club"" in which the 6-foot Texan star shed 38 pounds to play Ron Woodroof the unlikely mastermind behind a scheme to circumvent the FDA by delivering unapproved treatments to AIDS patients during the late 80s. But McConaugheys is not the only performance of note in this riveting and surprisingly relatable true story which co-stars Jared Leto as his transsexual accomplice. Rave reviews for both actors should draw mainstream auds to one of the years most vital and deserving indie efforts.This story first appeared in the September 17 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Nearly 20 years after launching his career as a hayseed hunk in ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation"" McConaughey subverts that same macho image by playing a redneck bigot who becomes the unlikely savior to a generation of gay men frightened by a disease they dont yet understand. Woodroof was straight -- which the film makes abundantly clear in his undiminished pursuit of any woman who crosses his path -- and reprehensibly homophobic to boot but his newfound outcast status inspired a sense of empathy toward his HIV-positive peers that not only motivated his actions but also serves as this exceptionally well-handled pics most valuable takeaway. Certainly what makes the character so interesting is the way that a man so driven by selfishness could undergo such a reversal after his own life was threatened. Craig Borten and Melisa Wallacks screenplay wastes little time in getting to the diagnosis After a workplace accident lands him in the hospital Woodroof is told that he has HIV by a pair of doctors (Denis OHare and Jennifer Garner) on the brink of implementing a new double-blind AZT trial among their patients at Dallas Mercy. Since best estimates give him only 30 days to live Woodroof decides he cant risk ending up in the placebo group and devises a way to scam some of the drug for himself. After a second near-death experience south of the border Woodroof realizes that AZT only makes his condition worse (especially when combined with his steady diet of cocaine booze and methamphetamines) leading him to experiment with a cocktail of potential remedies not yet sanctioned by the FDA. If theres a villain in the real-world version of this story its the virus. For the sake of dramatic conflict however the film pits Woodroof against two of the biggest forces in American society -- the government (represented by the FDA) and the corporate sector (""Big Pharma"") -- positioning him as the rule-breaking Robin Hood who circumvents their profit-oriented practices in order to get effective treatments into the hands of people. On one hand the drug companies are shown conspiring with hospitals like Dallas Mercy to rush AZT through the system even when research points to the medicines immunity-lowering side effects. At the same time the FDA appears to be dragging out the approval process on other promising options which means thousands will die before existing products get approved. For a detailed look at activist citizens struggle against these entities last years ""How to Survive a Plague"" does the trick while ""Dallas Buyers Club"" unfolds almost like a crazy heist movie Its the story of how one incredibly motivated creep managed to circumvent the system and redeem himself in the process. Canadian helmer Jean-Marc Vallee (best known for the real-feeling coming-of-ager ""C.R.A.Z.Y."") makes no effort to polish Woodroofs unrefined and frequently offensive worldview (his opening line is a slur against Rock Hudson with many unflattering epithets to follow). Meanwhile McConaughey commits to the character so fully he never lets himself off the hook with that apologetic wink so often tossed off when actors play someone whose politics they dont necessarily share. The role calls for nothing short of full immersion and the star -- whose recent roles in everything from ""Magic Mike"" to ""Mud"" have shown his commitment to total transformation -- comes off as almost unrecognizable apart from his charisma a bony scarecrow of a man with shaggy brown hair and a Freddy Mercury moustache. His Woodroof is a bull-riding chain-smoking good ol boy who might never have justified his existence on earth if not for the way he responds to this particular adversity and yet his coarse nothing-to-lose personality makes him the only person who could have turned such a seemingly hopeless situation to his advantage. Letos character Rayon is just the opposite sensitive considerate and not quite self-reliant. In another kind of movie audiences would root for his sort to escape such a backward place but here hes the queer character just nonthreatening enough to break through Woodroofs homophobic defenses inspiring an act of chivalry in the grocery store that ranks among the all-time great prejudice-melting scenes. The movie has to earn that moment and it does so by establishing such a genuine foundation for its characters. Like last springs ""Pain and Gain"" ""Dallas Buyers Club"" was inspired by an over-the-top magazine story but instead of treating everything as an enormous gonzo joke Vallee and his team use the outrageous details to deepen the human-interest angle. Although shot on a relatively tight budget the film convincingly re-creates the period via a gritty widescreen look that suits Vallees naturalistic style. With one exception (a cathartic moment for Garners increasingly frustrated character involving a hammer) the only music heard throughout plays on radios or jukeboxes in the background of scenes. The handheld shooting style is never so unsteady as to distract but instead lends an almost subliminal authenticity to scenes where character remains at the forefront at all times. Not since ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" has a film put such a fresh twist on the accepted AIDS narrative but instead of getting in the publics faces the way that crazy Jim Carrey comedy did ""Dallas Buyers Club"" works its way under their skin. By choosing such a vocally homophobic antihero writers Borten and Wallack ensure that no matter how uncomfortable audiences are with HIV or so-called ""alternative lifestyles"" they will recognize Woodroofs knee-jerk bigotry as uncool. And thus the film manages to educate without ever feeling didactic and to entertain in the face of what would to any other character seem like a grim life sentence.

TWITTER Matthew McConaughey Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto star in the true story of a hedonistic Texan homophobe who bounced back in surprising ways from the gut punch of his HIV-positive diagnosis. TORONTO - ""Life is strange"" sings Marc Bolan in one of a handful of T. Rex classics heard on the soundtrack of The Dallas Buyers Club. Putting fresh kinks in the familiar AIDS narrative Jean-Marc Vallees enthralling drama recounts the strange life of Ron Woodroof a womanizing Texas homophobe who stares down a 30-day death sentence and hustles his way to a place on the vanguard of experimental HIV/AIDS treatment. The potentially downbeat subject matter is handled with vigor and an assured light touch but the Focus Features release will get its biggest assist from the tremendous gusto of Matthew McConaugheys lead performance. While much of the attention will focus on the actors astonishing weight loss for the role transforming himself into a gaunt bag of bones for a good part of the action this is a full-bodied characterization that will take McConaugheys already impressive career regeneration several steps further. PHOTOS The Scene at the Toronto Film Festival 2013 His recent director on Magic Mike Steven Soderbergh comes to mind while watching this accomplished feature from Quebecois filmmaker Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y. The Young Victoria). The unconstrained visual style the gritty feel for environment the ease of the character interplay and the fuss-free almost casual eye for detail all recall the looseness and vitality of Soderberghs best work. Vallee and screenwriters Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack waste no time in conveying what type of man Ron is introducing him in the midst of a coke-fueled three-way in a rodeo holding pen with a couple of trashy women. A Dallas electrician by trade and a reckless cowboy by nature he lands in Mercy Hospital in 1985 after a minor work accident. A blood test reveals he has the HIV virus and an alarmingly low T-cell count. But he reacts with hostility to doctors Sevard (Denis OHare) and Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) interpreting their diagnosis as a slur on his rampantly heterosexual masculinity. After some hard-partying denial the stark reality of his deteriorating health prompts Ron to start researching the virus. Unwilling to take his chances in clinical trials for the new drug AZT he begins buying doses from a crooked hospital orderly. But when that supply dries up he crosses the border to Mexico where an unlicensed American doctor (Griffin Dunne) is getting results with alternative treatments. PHOTOS The Scene at the Toronto Film Festival 2013 Translating his own urgent need for medication into an entrepreneurial opportunity Ron begins smuggling supplies of vitamin- and protein-based anti-viral meds into Texas. In order to build a client base among the unfamiliar gay community he partners with a drug-addicted transsexual he met in the hospital Rayon (Jared Leto) who isnt scared off by bigoted Rons animosity. To get around potential legal strife they establish a club in which monthly membership buys a full treatment regimen. Ron also begins traveling - to Japan China the Netherlands - for AIDS drugs being developed abroad undeterred by the attempts of the FDA the DEA and the IRS to shut him down. The contemplative movie doesnt advocate self-medication nor does it trivialize the long and hard-fought frontline battle for effective HIV treatment in America (see last years brilliant doc How to Survive a Plague) by elevating the rogue efforts of a straight guy. It tells a very specific story of one AIDS patients refusal to slink off and die quietly while the medical profession and pharmaceutical giants dragged their heels focusing almost exclusively on prohibitively expensive AZT and ignoring its toxic side effects. TORONTO VIDEOS THR Behind the Lens While that shameful chapter of American institutional failure to address a pandemic is explored only peripherally here it provides rich background texture. Likewise the homophobic ignorance directed at Ron by his former drinking buddies giving him an illuminating taste of his own intolerance. But what distinguishes Borten and Wallacks screenplay is its refusal to sentimentalize by providing humbling epiphanies to set Ron on the right path and endow him with empathy. His racket remains driven primarily by self-interest and yet almost unwittingly his crusade for the right to control his treatment becomes an altruistic one while his attitude toward people he once scorned softens by imperceptible degrees. McConaughey plays these subtle shifts beautifully in a rowdy turn thats full of piss and vinegar but also unexpected heart. Ron is presented as such irredeemable trash early on that it requires an actor who can own the rough edges but also has real charm deployment skills to keep him in our sympathies. McConaughey aces that tricky balancing act. He has affecting moments both with Garner and Leto but the surprise is how funny he makes the story of a man pushing back death. Garners role has less dimension but she brings a lot of warmth as Eve comes around to admiring Rons resourcefulness and recognizing the merit in what hes doing. In the showier supporting role Leto is simply wonderful. Fully inhabiting Rayon he makes the slender creature anything but synthetic his flirtatious banter poignantly underscored by helpless self-destructiveness.

We first see him in a dirty sweaty hay-strewn pen fornicating at the rodeo. Matthew McConaugheys Ron Woodroof is living like an animal. By the end of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" he will have touched the lives of thousands using a mix of cunning and strength fueled by self-preservation. The Oskar Schindler of Texas gay underclass in the mid-1980s Ron Woodroof is a difficult man to like at first and director Jean-Marc Vallee doesnt hurry his transformation into a hero but when the Hollywood mechanics of this top notch ""prestige picture"" kick-in good luck seeing this without a handkerchief. A staff electrician for a shady Texas drilling concern Ron also deals a little narcotics runs a small time gambling operation drinks to excess gets in fights lives in squalor never bathes has a hacking cough screws floozies who dont have much to say and maintains a rather nasty (and fiercely homophobic) demeanor. After an accident lands him the hospital hes told he has HIV and an extremely low T-cell count. Hes given 30 days to get his affairs in order. Day 1 is dedicated to getting loaded and laid but eventually he he heads to the library to read up about AIDS. He learns of some trial drugs (specifically AZT) and heads back to the hospital to get some. Here doctors Jennifer Garner and Dennis OHare teach him a hard lesson in bureaucracy. There are blind trials but FDA rules prevent just handing out new medication. After prayers to a higher power for some sort of sign (a clever gag reveals hes at a strip joint not a church) he works an angle to get some stolen AZT. Further leads bring him down to Mexico where an American doctor whose license has been revoked (an unrecognizable and fantastic Griffin Dunne) cleans him up takes him off AZT and gives him a cocktail of new proteins vitamins and drugs. Thinking back to some of the desperate people he saw in support groups - and particularly his hospital roommate - Woodruff casually mentions ""hey you could make a lot of money off this."" ""Dallas Buyers Club"" then effortlessly glides into a different gear with Woodruff smuggling in carloads of unapproved (but not illegal) medication. Even though he has his own relative health as proof to potential buyers (he still looks rail thin but not deaths door sickly) he begrudgingly teams up with that former hospital roomie for a distribution network. That man is Rayon a trans individual played by Jared Leto a perfect performance coming to us at a perfect time. Rayon isnt just the wacky gay friend - he is a complex and heartbreaking figure and Leto tears into this role with everything hes got. His portrayal of Rayon is imbued with such heart that no one will doubt that his struggles are enough to change the heart and mind of someone so rough-around-the-edges as Woodruff. With ""Dallas Buyers Club"" Leto elevates directly to the top of the A-List. His career will never be the same. Not to disregard McConaughey. His physical transformation for this role is remarkable as is his ability to somehow win our sympathies before his attitude changes. Once Woodruff has a clear mission it is quite fun to rally behind him. It makes you wish hed found this industrious side of himself before getting sick. But ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is by no means perfect. It definitely takes large leaps in terms of presenting the science medicine and care behind Woodruffs for-profit scheme. And while the Reagan-era FDA deserves plenty of hisses (choose from any number of documentaries on the topic for more) the institution is presented here with as much subtlety as ""Ghostbusters"" portrays Walter Pecks EPA. The specifics of plot (or any formal eccentricity) arent whats going to stay with you however. Its all about the performances. McConaughey and Leto dont just give voice to the disenfranchised of the 1980s but all people suddenly faced with impossible challenges. The fireworks caused by pitting never-say-die Texas bravado against heartlessness is a powerful mix and ""Dallas Buyers Club"" somehow manages to be an inspiring tale amidst all this sadness.
