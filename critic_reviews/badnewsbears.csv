Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateReel TimeRunning thoughts on movies and their makings.July 29 2005 156 PM Remake My Day New singers new songs on The Bad News Bearsand The Beat That My Heart Skipped By David Edelstein The Bad News Bears take two The best reason to see Richard Linklaters wholly unnecessary but highly enjoyable remake of The Bad News Bears (Paramount) is Billy Bob Thornton whos doing a PG-13 version of his Bad Santa. Thornton embodies the kind of flamboyantly dissolute but acidly intelligent Southern layabout who makes sloth alcoholism and self-abuse alarmingly attractive. A former Major League baseball player tossed out of the game for cold-cocking an umpire and forced to take a coaching job for the money he pulls up to his first Little League game dumps out part of his nonalcoholic beer and tops it up with bourbon. He has strange radioactive yellow hair and tattoos and his T-shirt reads ""She looked good last night."" In the Michael Ritchie original Walter Matthau was a delightful rumpled presence but you knew that he was cuddly underneath. Thornton has no heart of gold Its only when his self-disgust becomes too oppressive that he changes his ways. Otherwise the movie is beat-for-beat the same as Ritchies with the addition of a kid in a wheelchair a black kid who worships Mark McGwire etc. Linklater has become an excellent studio craftsman but theres something missing. When the camera pulls back at the end of the original to show the American flag fluttering over the baseball field the image--and the scruffy defiance of the Bad News Bears--meant something in the context of a counterculture in its death throes. Here its a non-sequitur a throwaway. Be still my heart ... Advertisement In my review of The Aristocrats I challenge Penn Jillettes assertion that its always ""the singer not the song"" that determines a work of arts meaning. Maybe we should split the difference because sometimes the singer changes everything. A fascinating exercise would be to watch back to back James Tobacks Fingers and Jacques Audiards smashing French remake The Beat That My Heart Skipped (Wellspring Media). Tobacks 1977 film--about a once-promising pianist (Harvey Keitel) now working as a thuggish debt collector for his dad--is austere arty and grimly fatalistic. White walls plaintive piano music You know the drill. Its about the death of a mans creative spirit--and his soul. Audiards take on the other hand is fevered immediate and hopeful--a story of a man recovering his soul. The most intense and compelling sections of The Beat are almost word for word from Fingers (albeit translated into French) but this beat changes everything. Good for Audiard--and for Toback for giving his blessing.... 1100 a.m. P.T. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

Comments Bad News Bears Many repeat performances are being sought in this remake of Michael Ritchies 1976 comedy about unpromising Little Leaguers with an alcoholic coach and a star female pitcher with its sound track of four-letter words and themes from Bizets Carmen. But this is also a spin-off of Bad Santa (with both that movies writers as well as its star Billy Bob Thornton) and The School of Rock (with Richard Linklater back as hired-hand director). Fortunately almost everyone acquits himself coolly and admirably; only costars Greg Kinnear and Marcia Gay Harden ham it up. PG-13 111 min.

It looks like its coming at you hard and fast but it holds something back on the delivery and by the time it crosses the plate its surprisingly inert. That same off-speed tempo unfortunately permeates the entire film -- though that probably wasnt director Richard Linklaters intention.The pacing stops and starts the energy comes and goes and never reaches the all-encompassing hilarity of Linklaters ""The School of Rock."" Some solid laughs pop up here and there but even the best parts serve as a reminder of how inferior and needless this remake really is.And while all remakes are needless this one is especially even though screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa remain structurally faithful to Bill Lancasters 1976 script about a talentless band of Little Leaguers and their lush of a coach. ""The Bad News Bears"" is a comedy classic one that still holds up beautifully today.One of the main problems in the new version is casting.Billy Bob Thornton has proven he can do pretty much anything -- from ""Sling Blade"" to ""Monsters Ball"" to ""Friday Night Lights"" -- but he simply does not look haggard washed-up or miserable enough to be a believable Morris Buttermaker the role Walter Matthau immortalized.Hes too tan and trim and smooth to be an alcoholic ex-ballplayer; he looks more like a rock star with his tats and his fashionably spiky hair.Hes also just doing a lackadaisical version of his sad-sack character from ""Bad Santa"" which Ficarra and Requa also wrote. And while that was a wild romp and Thornton was disarmingly funny in it weve seen it already. First-time actress and real-life athlete Sammi Kane Kraft as star pitcher Amanda reportedly has a fastball thats been clocked at 70 mph but doesnt have the stuff of Tatum ONeal. Then again few actresses do. Though she adds realism to the on-field action the emotional scenes her character shares with Buttermaker ring hollow. And Jeff Davies stepping into the role of slugger Kelly Leak (Steve Nash must have been busy that day) exudes none of the dangerousness necessary to believe that this is the baddest kid around. Hes just quiet and he likes to ride his motorbike.(Timmy Deters though IS the second coming of Tanner Boyle. Its eerie.)More importantly ""Bad News Bears"" tries but fails to capture the subversiveness that seemed revolutionary nearly 30 years ago. Perhaps Linklater was doomed from the start just because nothings shocking anymore.Part of why the original stood out was that it dared to show the way kids really talk in all their obnoxious uncensored glory. Here the filmmakers just tried to ratchet up the raunchiness with slurs that reflect the changing ethnicity of the San Fernando Valley -- theres an Armenian kid on the team now; the lone black player Ahmad worships Mark McGwire; and the nerdy Ogilvie character has been turned into a boy of Indian descent who keeps stats on his laptop. Theres also a player in a motorized wheelchair ostensibly to show the ridiculousness of being politically correct.Also the name of the sponsor on the back of the Bears uniforms is now a strip club called Bo Peeps rather than Chicos Bail Bonds from the original. (The team also spends a great deal of time after games at Hooters which almost seems quaint.)Buttermaker can drunkenly throw high and inside all he wants during batting practice -- as he does when he dings Ahmad in the head then assures him ""Its all right kid you had your helmet on.""But the pitches just dont register on the radar gun.

The good news Its still really really good. Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Richard Linklaters new version of Michael Ritchies boisterous and brilliant 1976 baseball comedy ""Bad News Bears"" isnt better than the original -- how could it be? That picture aside from being extraordinarily well-paced had a brazenness that you didnt see in kids movies at the time (and dont see today even though parents are always lamenting how sophisticated their children are). The original earned a reputation for its bad language which included the famous line delivered by the young hothead Tanner (Chris Barnes) about the teams being made up of ""Jews spics niggers pansies and a booger-eating moron"" -- as fabulously offensive a line as a screenwriter (in that case the late Bill Lancaster son of Burt whose screenplay won him a Writers Guild Award) could ever dream up but also if you think about it as a metaphor for what this country is made of a touchingly inclusive one. But it was the spirit of the original even more than any forbidden language that made it so freeing. (Plus the way the themes of honor and sportsmanship went down like soda pop -- they may be potent but theyre so skillfully underplayed that theyre not assaultive.) Linklater has taken great care to preserve that spirit in this new ""Bad News Bears"" and in many ways his movie correlates with the original note for note. Using Lancasters script as a starting point writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who also wrote the exquisitely naughty ""Bad Santa"") have retooled much of the language -- the ""booger-eating moron"" survives though not the rest of the line but like the original the picture makes the point that even though kids are aware of racial differences they dont necessarily use them to pass judgment on their peers the way sometimes even well-intentioned grown-ups do. Billy Bob Thornton is Morris Buttermaker the boozing ex-has-been ballplayer (hes several steps removed from his dim vague glory days) who has been hired by a rich type-A lawyer-mom Liz Whitewood (Marcia Gay Harden) to coach a team of kids who have been shut out of the local kids baseball league because theyre not good enough. Buttermaker takes her check gladly (""Is that thing glued to your fingers?"" he drawls irritably when shes not quick enough in handing it over). But like his earlier counterpart played by Walter Matthau this Buttermaker doesnt seem to like kids very much -- any kids. But the more he gets to know this particular gang of squirts the more they grow on him. His team includes boys of Armenian and Indian parentage (Aman Johal and Jeffrey Tedmori respectively) as well as a kid in a wheelchair (Troy Gentile) and of course the foul-mouthed anger-management nightmare Tanner (played here by Timmy Deters with hilariously put-on aggressiveness). When Buttermaker realizes how hard the kids take it when they lose he recruits an ex-girlfriends daughter (Sammi Kane Kraft) and a local bad-boy skateboarder (Jeffrey Davies) both killer athletes to give the team the juice it needs. Linklater seems to genuinely like working with kids and as he already proved with ""School of Rock"" he knows how to riff on their unpredictability without resorting to any ""Kids say the darnedest things"" cutesiness. He also takes a few dangerous chances here particularly by including the wheelchair-using character Hooper whose belligerence (one of his first lines is ""Thats right Im in a wheelchair"") is played for laughs although we also come to realize that its an act a test of what he can get away with and not a part of his true character at all. And in a spin on the old routine of taking dads to task for working so hard that they dont spend enough time with their kids Linklater also includes a ballsy scene in which Buttermaker calls Liz on the carpet for not stopping to think about how shes raising her son despite her aggressiveness in looking after him -- a comment on contemporary parents who strive to do everything right by their kids but sometimes fall down on the job in ways they cant even see. (Its important to note though that Linklater also humanizes Liz and doesnt make her a villain.) You Might Also Like The kids in ""Bad News Bears"" are great fun to watch but Thornton steals the show. He may be younger and at least conventionally speaking better-looking than Matthau was in the same role but his character is even more enjoyably dissolute. He has a coterie of girlfriends recruited from the local strip joints as well as Hooters (where he takes the kids for post-game celebrations -- theyre less interested in the hooters than they are in the French fries). He doesnt give a damn about what he should or shouldnt say to these little pitchers batters and outfielders with big ears. (""Youve got a swing like Helen Keller at a pinata party"" he berates his innocent charges.) Buttermaker works as an exterminator and at one point he takes the kids on the job with him. When two of them start squirting one another with highly toxic insecticide he leaps out of the bushes to break it up. ""Stop it"" he tells them and after waiting two beats adds ""That stuffs expensive"" Thornton gives us a Buttermaker whos recklessly handsome in a surly sort of way and his sick sense of humor doesnt hurt either. Its a hugely entertaining performance but even though its very different from the terrific one Matthau gave it doesnt lead the picture too far astray from the tone of the original. Linklater includes several nods to the first picture -- including a shot of an embroidered peasant blouse hanging in a vintage-clothing stall a subtle but clear homage to the haute-hippie outfit Tatum ONeal wore in her first scene in the original movie. (And the movies poster is a nod to the one Mad magazine artist Jack Davis designed for the original.) Hollywood remakes are everywhere this season and audiences seem to be tiring of them with good reason. But at least Linklater isnt just picking the bones of his forebears; he honors them as they deserve. ""Bad News Bears"" may be about bratty upstarts but Linklater is enough of a grown-up to know that sometimes its not a bad idea to listen to your elders.

With a script co-credited to Bill Lancaster who penned the original 1976 screenplay Bad News Bears is true to its source rarely diverging from the earlier films storyline and occasionally re-creating entire scenes. There is however a difference in tone. The 70s edition of the film was more family friendly than Richard Linklaters one. Gleefully profane and un-PC Bad News Bears earns its PG-13 rating and may cause more conservative parents to shy away from bringing younger children to screenings. Is there a reason to see a faithful remake rather than simply rent the original? In this case the affirmative is supplied by Billy Bob Thornton. Rather than aping grumpy-but-loveable Walter Matthau Thornton makes this role his own. He plays it like his Bad Santa character (albeit run through a PG-13 filter). Thornton doesnt want Morris Buttermaker to be cute or cuddly. He wants him to be brash nasty and crude - and he succeeds in that aim. We end up liking Buttermaker anyway much as we eventually come to Thorntons boozy bawdy Bad Santa. Thornton is Bad News Bears selling point and lone acting standout. (The absence of someone to rival Tatum ONeal is noticeable.) The Bad News Bears was the granddaddy of kids sports movies. It has countless descendants each safer and more generic than its predecessors. With the remake Linklater returns the edge to the kids. Sure some of the children are misunderstood underachievers who reach their potential but others are unrepentant misfits or incompetents who never improve. That is - and has always been - part of the movies charm. The Bears dont metamorphose overnight from a bunch of losers into a fantasy-tinged winner. And Buttermaker is not a Mr. Miyazaki with a cure for all of lifes ills. (But he has better one-liners.) Buttermaker is an ex-minor leaguer who after falling on hard times has decided to coach the little league Bears (theres a check involved). His players while not as misanthropic as their manager are a motley crew. They include a fat guy a boy in a wheelchair a black kid who idolizes Mark McGwire a girl pitcher and a juvenile delinquent home run hitter. After three consecutive losses and one tie the Bears turn their season around and end up in the championship game battling the unbeatable Yankees who are coached by the smug Roy Bullock (Greg Kinnear) the poster child for parents who overvalue winning. Buttermaker is the kind of guy no parent would want as a childs role model. He spikes his non-alcoholic beer gets a strip club to sponsor the baseball team preaches the virtues of lying and hosts a victory dinner at Hooters (where everyone joins in a lusty rendition of Eric Claptons ""Cocaine""). When the team threatens to rebel he informs them ""This isnt a democracy. Its a dictatorship. And Im Hitler."" For fun he takes them to work with him and allows them to help exterminating bugs and rodents. When two engage in an insecticide fight spraying each other with toxic fluids he demands that they stop because ""thats expensive stuff."" During the second half of Bad News Bears when the sports movie clichA(c)s become abundant theres always Buttermaker to hold our interest. Greg Kinnear a solid character actor does the kind of thing he does best - provide us with a good secondary player. Kinnear is capable of playing a nice guy but in this case hes the villain - a preening win-obsessed coach who cares more about getting the victory than letting the kids have fun. Marcia Gay Harden is wasted. Her role as a players mom is so inconsequential that its easy to forget shes in the movie. Sammi Kraft gets the Tatum ONeal role and does the best she can with it. Unfortunately she too often seems like a pale copy. Jeff Davies has the key part of Kelly Leak but hes not very good and the character comes across like someone in need of a more detailed subplot. The soundtrack caught my attention because of its offbeat nature. Instead of relying on the usual mix of a generic sports movie score and current pop songs Linklater goes a different route. He and composer Ed Shearmur employ a variety of classical numbers all jazzed up to match the films tempo. Those who remember the 70s ""Hooked on Classics"" fad will recognize what this sounds like. When it comes to the existence of Bad News Bears ""Why?"" is the most apropos question. Why do a remake? And why did a respected director like Richard Linklater (Before Sunset School of Rock) agree to take the helm? Money probably has a lot to do with the answers to both queries. Fortunately in the process of pursuing a box office winner Linklater has crafted an entertaining motion picture. Bad News Bears wont make fans forget the original but its not so feeble that it disappears into the earlier movies shadow.

"Roguish Bearer of Bad News washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Roguish Bearer of Bad News Billy Bob Thornton plays Coach Buttermaker a misanthropic ex-baseball pro who must lead a motley youth team in ""Bad News Bears."" (Paramount Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 22 2005 IN THE wonderful ""Bad Santa"" Billy Bob Thornton established himself as a lovable rogue a storefront Santa Claus who hated Christmas and kids. In ""Bad News Bears"" which just happens to be co-scripted by the same writers (Glenn Ficarra and John Requa) hes a recycled version of the same persona. But so far this shtick shows no signs of getting old. And its the essential ingredient in this remake of the 1976 movie in which Thorntons a beer-swilling misanthrope who turns a ragtag trash-talking gang of kiddie misfits into Little League contenders. As Coach Buttermaker a former minor league pro who played one part of an inning he doesnt have a politically correct bone in his body. Which is why when one of his pitches beans a kid on the head he tells the boy he should be glad he was wearing a helmet. And when Buttermaker orders the team to run in at the double he tells a kid in a wheelchair to put his wheelchair into fourth gear. The movie directed by Richard Linklater is a faithful remake of the Tatum ONeal-Walter Matthau classic of the same name with only minor updates and changes to Bill Lancasters original screenplay. In the 1976 version Matthaus Buttermaker cleaned pools. Thorntons Buttermaker is an exterminator who snaps up a couple of ringers including the daughter (Sammi Kraft) of an old flame who has a powerful throwing arm and Kelly Leak (Jeff Davies) a punk who can knock em out of the park anytime. The filmmakers have added Matthew Hooper (Troy Gentile) the aforementioned kid in the wheelchair; an Armenian called Garo (Jeffrey Tedmori); and an Indian kid Prem (Aman Johal) who brings a laptop to the games. And this time the African American (K.C. Harris) in the Bears digs Mark McGwire not Hank Aaron. If truth be told the movie is dead without Thornton. The young actors arent the most stellar thesps to swear their way through a film. And the plot which involves the Bears going up against nasty Coach Bullock (Greg Kinnear) and his arrogant Yankees team is trite. But you dont watch ""Bad News Bears"" for the action out on the diamond. You hang out with that hangdog coach so you can catch every slurry sour-mouthed retort coming out of his mouth. Now thats color commentary. BAD NEWS BEARS (PG-13 111 minutes) -- Contains obscenity a little baseball violence and adult boozing in front of children. Area theaters.

"Sliding Home washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Sliding Home Two hits no errors Billy Bob Thornton shown with young Jeffrey Tedmori takes the Walter Matthau role of reprobate Little League coach and runs with it. (By Deana Newcomb -- Paramount Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 22 2005 The best thing about the new version of ""Bad News Bears"" is that none of todays idiots decided they could fix it. They were smart enough to realize the original wasnt broke. So with a few mild updates it feels more like a tracing of the original 1976 film than a remake. The difference of course is that while in the original the great Walter Matthau defined bitter old-guy squalor torpor and pathology in one way Billy Bob Thornton defines bitter old-guy squalor torpor and pathology in another. So for connoisseurs of the reprobate lifestyle its nuances and filigrees its twisted little arroyos and backed-up sewers of broken dreams one film is as good as the other. Where Matthau was merely indifferent and beyond illusion Thornton is actually seamy with a kind of trailer-trash hostility undercutting his bile. Theres a sexualized ugliness to his character as hes a habitue of strip bars and isnt above a toss in the hay with the mother of a kid. Matthau was merely worthless while Thornton God bless his soul rises to the actual level of sociopathic. I love it when that happens. Presumably this was the contribution of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who wrote Thorntons ""Bad Santa"" and understand just how funny the Arkansan can be when infected with full-bore misanthropy or should I say funny to those of us who arent Boy Scout troop leaders Amway sales people televangelists or other team-oriented can-do up-with-people type personalities. (Those folks should probably stay way away; and I do mean way away.) The late Bill Lancaster (the great Burts son) also gets a writing credit for writing the 1976 original. In any case most people are familiar with both the story and the gimmick. The Bears are a Little League team of castoffs and rejects so lame they are the butt of the leagues jokes and openly despised by all and sundry including in some cases their own parents. Only one person can be found to coach them the neighborhood loser Morris Buttermaker who had brief major league experience many years ago but now may be seen lurking lazily about the edges of polite society usually with a drink in hand. In the 76 version he was a pool cleaner in this an exterminator so Ficarra and Requa have added a few especially tasteless dead animal jokes. Of course Morris agrees to coach (for a fee of course; no noblesse oblige anywhere near him) and soon sees how hapless his charges are. He responds to this crisis by drinking even more. Of course another coach tees him off (Vic Morrow in the original Greg Kinnear an improvement here) and he decides to turn the team into winners by bringing in two ringers his own ex-stepdaughter (Tatum ONeal at the beginning of her first run of stardom in the first; Sammi Kraft here) and a local hood (Jeffrey Davies) who happens to be a superb athlete even if hed prefer motocrossing the field as opposed to hitting dingers. The gimmick was that Lancaster was the first screenwriter to desentimentalize children. They had for six decades been apotheosized by Hollywood portrayed as sugary little angels who at worst were mischievous as in the ""Our Gang"" comedies. ""The Bad Seed"" a definite exception to the rule (and famous because of it) portrayed a kid as out and out bad. That was about it. Along comes Lancaster who shows them as foul-mouthed little beasties treacherous combative ruthless and capable of great ugliness to each other. It was so refreshing back in 76 to see kids curse and rant and behave in recognizable human patterns that connected in memory with the real childhood of most adults. Nobody in this variation messes with that magic particularly the gifted director Richard Linklater (""Dazed and Confused"" his first big hit) who clearly knows his way around a kid. In fact whole sequences as well as the names and personalities of the boys are reiterated beat by beat. You think That old stuff? Still funny? Come on But That old stuff. Still funny. Of course the two additions to the team are soon hogging the glory and even the lesser boys grow addicted to victory. Of course the true journey in the film is the inner one as the hopeless roue Morris is affected emotionally by his poorer athletes their yearning for acceptance their hunger for selfhood and soon enough -- mirabile dictu  -- hes become the champ of the underdogs and wants the lamer boys to win on their own even risking the biggest game to see if it can happen. I was somewhat annoyed by his redemption redemption being a hack screenwriters conceit a lot more common in movies than real life. And Good Morris like Good Santa is a lot less fun than Bad Morris was. Oh well. If the great Matthau has sadly gone onward to that cocktail bar in the sky where the martinis are always cold the olives ripe and firm and nobody has told him he cant smoke his Menckenian-Fieldian spirit is still embodied by the thin-armed tattooed laconic sleazebo from Arkansas. The movie is fun though not great and Billy Bob rules. Bad News Bears (111 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for extreme profanity and sexual innuendo.

Billy Bob Thornton shines in Bad News Bears a remake of the 1976 movie about Little League baseball. Paramount Pictures Theres also School of Rock director Richard Linklater dodging kids again as writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (more comfy with Thorntons Bad Santa) give the once-over to Bill Lancasters classic 1976 script. Real baseball fans say every game offers something you havent seen before but once we note that this is Bad News Bears and the original added a ""The"" to the title whats to say about this movie? Not much other than to ask just how much the execs who make these titular decisions rake in. Thornton is an obvious pick to take over the beer-swilling coach role from Walter Matthau who scored one of his biggest hits with the sleeper that did for Little League what Jim Boutons Ball Four did for (or to) the Bigs. An ode to bad sportsmanship the original Bears was the first movie to admit that organized youth baseball can sometimes engender rampant jerk-dom from the parent coaches living their lives through their progeny. (Related video Watch the Bad News Bears trailer.) Thorntons childless ex-major league pitcher (he lasted two-thirds of an inning thanks to assault on an umpire) will have none of this. Hes an anti-role model but at least not the phony rah-rah martinet his coaching rival (Greg Kinnear) is. Thornton runs an exterminating business and some of the funniest scenes here involve his disposal of dead rats when he isnt boozing in the dugout or struggling to teach diamond fundamentals. About the movie Bad News Bears   (out of four) Stars Billy Bob Thornton Greg Kinnear Marcia Gay Harden Sammi Kane Kraft Director Richard Linklater Distributor Paramount Running time 1 hour 53 minutes Rated PG-13 for rude behavior language throughout some sexuality and thematic elements Opens Friday nationwide Thornton aside the new Bears stumbles with its casting. Newcomer Sammi Kane Kraft is convincing on the mound but is otherwise no match for the wonderful Tatum ONeal as the Bears surprise pitching ace in the original. And while Kinnear is simply your standard-issue fool the late Vic Morrow astutely captured the anger (not always submerged) that some coaches take out on rival teams. Still the material is so solid and Thornton so tailor-made that the movie almost gets by. The kids go to Hooters and drink non-alcoholic beer a tweak on the rah-rah piety associated with prayer meetings before football games. But its not as if John A. Alonzos sun-baked photography and Polly Platts brilliant production design from the original werent readily available. Theyre on DVD just as this version will be very soon.

Directed by Richard Linklater from a screenplay by Bill Lancaster Glenn Ficarra and John Requa based on the 1976 film written by Lancaster. 111 minutes. Rated PG-13 for rude behavior and language throughout some sexuality and thematic elements. Several theaters. Bad news for ""Bad News Bears""? No just mediocre. Richard Linklaters remake isnt any worse than the 1976 kids-talking-dirty baseball comedy ""The Bad News Bears"" but it certainly isnt any better either. And while the screenplay has been slightly updated to the new millennium (the teams a bit more diverse and I dont think Hooters was around in 76) its really not all that different. All this adds up to a passable film that has no particular reason to exist. The original film which starred Walter Matthau as a washed-up alcoholic ballplayer who finds himself coaching a ragtag kids team was a big hit spawning two lackluster sequels. In those days before political correctness it was mildly shocking (and thrilling for kids who watched it -- myself included) to hear 12-year-olds use raunchy language and racial slurs and to see them matter-of-factly drinking beer. Linklaters new version updated by screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (from Bill Lancasters original script) straddles a difficult line The language remains offensive but in a different way. In 2005 apparently racial slurs no longer fly but homosexual epithets sneak in (from the mouth of young Tanner a cheerfully foul towhead). The beer is now nonalcoholic except for those constantly swigged by Billy Bob Thornton in the Matthau role; the cigarettes are gone and the most shocking moment is one in which all the kids pile into Thorntons car to go for a ride without seatbelts. By the standards of the original Linklaters film is a creampuff but parents should note the PG-13 rating; This isnt a Disney movie. What remains is a by-the-book underdog sports story and while its occasionally got a nice sunniness to it theres a perfunctory feel to the proceedings as if it was slapped together in a hurry. A subplot about a former girlfriend of the coach has no payoff and the kids pop on and off delivering their lines but never really registering. Linklater proved with ""School of Rock"" that he can do terrific work with kids but he seems to be coasting here. Hes one of the busiest directors around (this is his fifth theatrical release since 2001) and perhaps that schedule is catching up with him; this film feels rushed and indistinct. But Thornton is as vivid as ever; an agreeable loser wryly tossing out his lines like lazy pop flies letting them hang in the air. To a kid who wonders what to tell his strict father about the teams pathetic record Thornton cheerfully tells him to lie reminding the kid ""This is America."" If you missed ""The Bad News Bears"" the first time around this one might be worth catching just for Thornton; otherwise its just extra innings on a game thats already played out.

Starring Billy Bob Thornton Greg Kinnearand Marcia Gay Harden. Directed by Richard Linklater. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Areatheaters.) ""Bad News Bears"" is a remake of an OK kids baseball movie from 1976 which spawned a pair of lackluster sequels. It would hardly seem a candidate for a remake and yet look whos involved in this one. Billy Bob Thornton Marcia Gay Harden (both Oscar winners) and Greg Kinnear (an Oscar nominee) star in it and behind the camera theres none other than director Richard Linklater (back from Paris where he was last seen following Julie Delpy around with a boom microphone filming ""Before Sunset""). With such people involved ""Bad News Bears"" would certainly have to be special or so one might think. In fact all those folks are just slumming. Maybe they like kids or baseball; maybe they just wanted to be outdoors. Nothing happens here that would distinguish this film from other sports movies released in the past few months namely ""The Longest Yard"" (about football) and ""Rebound"" (about basketball). The sports change but the movies stay fairly identical. Thornton who has overtaken Sean Connery as the actor who wears the most entertaining wigs on-screen plays Buttermaker a drunken womanizing exterminator -- with a modest big leagues history -- who takes a job coaching a Little League baseball team. Does he care whether they win? Of course not. So they lose -- in the beginning. Then as in ""Rebound"" he begins to take an interest. And as in both ""The Longest Yard"" and ""Rebound"" he begins to recruit a few key players. And as in ""Rebound"" he becomes a better person for the experience etc. ... The movie retains two distinctive gimmicks from the original ""The Bad News Bears."" The kids do a lot of cursing something one normally almost never hears on-screen. And for no particular reason except for kicks or to be deliberately strange selections from George Bizets ""Carmen"" make up most of the soundtrack. The screenplay by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa an adaptation of the original by the late Bill Lancaster makes the most of Thorntons dry skewed humor. ""Baseball is hard"" he tells the kids. ""You can love it but it doesnt always love you back. Its like dating a German girl."" Usually the opposing coach in sports movies is typed as a supercilious lightweight but though Kinnear almost serves that function he gets to show some other colors. Hes the opposition but hes also presented as a responsible and fairly decent guy. Yet looking for nuance in a film of this kind is absurd since its entire reason for being is to conform to pattern. Perhaps someday French auteurists will be able to figure out how ""Bad News Bears"" fits into the cinematic oeuvre of Richard Linklater. But in 2005 in a blind taste test I couldnt possibly have identified this as a Linklater movie and hes a filmmaker I generally like. If anything ""Bad News Bears"" shows that Linklater can get in and out of a movie like a cat burglar without leaving his fingerprints anywhere. OK hes proven it. He need never do that again. The kids are amusing though none so amusing as to stand out with the exception of Sammi Kane Kraft mainly because she plays the only girl on the team but also because she has a convincing rapport with Thornton. -- Advisory This film contains drunkenness lewdness and children cursing.

"No good news about the Bears - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Engelberg No good news about the Bearsmovies - reviewThe remake isnt sweet and it isnt funny eitherJuly 22 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticThe remake of Bad News Bears is a comic cultural history lesson. How far we have come in 29 short years.Its a coarser culture. One kid was famous for swearing in the original. In the remake most of the kids can cuss.""Little League Dads"" were an exception back then. Theyre the norm now so much so that Greg Kinnear can play one without any child-abusing edge and we still recognize the ""type.""There were no Hooters back then children didnt know the lyrics to J.J. Cales ""Cocaine"" and you didnt make fun of boys in wheelchairs.And there were no cell phones back in 1976. It would have been a lot tougher for Billy Bob Thornton to phone in his lackluster performance back in the day.The new Bears has a rougher rating. The baseball is better thanks to young stars Sammi Kraft and Orlandos Jeff Davies both of whom are better players than actors.But it isnt funny; it isnt sweet and it has none of the innocence of the original.Same story -- kids not good enough to play for anybody else are led by a drunken loser of a coach who had a moment and only a moment in the big leagues.Different job for ""Boilermaker"" Buttermaker -- a pool cleaner then an exterminator now.Same music mostly -- Bizets Carmen with an emphasis on ""March of the Toreadors.""Different sponsor for the team -- Chicos Bail Bonds then something more colorful now.Same number of Oscar winners two -- Walter Matthau and Tatum ONeal then Billy Bob and Marcia Gay Harden now.Same ending.But boy something major was lost in the translation. Its as if Slacker icon Richard Linklater guilty over the success of School of Rock set out to botch a cant-miss package.Jokes flail and fail. Billy Bob even repeats a riff. ""You guys swing like Helen Keller at a pinata party.""And when things turn desperate which is pretty much right after the opening credits they go for the stand-up comics last resort the penis joke the toilet joke and every variation therein.Sometime before shooting started Thornton seems to have tired of the Bad Santa thing that he was hired to do. Hes a well-groomed lady-killer of a loser no longer a guy who finds redemption in Little League. This Buttermaker doesnt hate kids. He starts to care way too soon. So the character has no arc. Thats a huge hole in the story.The ""big game"" formula in which lovable losers transform into unlikely winners was perfected by the original film. It still works though Kinnears Yankee coach has none of the menace that Vic Morrow brought to the part.And the kids -- the portly Engelberg (Brandon Craggs) the diminutive fighter Tanner (Timmy Deters) the wheelchair-bound-and-milking-it Hooper (Troy Gentile) have little of the charm of that original cast.But quality issues aside your kids are going to want to go to this. Let them.Where else are they going to learn how to curse flip the bird lie cheat drink mix martinis ogle Hooters tarts and be bad sports? Or are they picking that up at home?

Kids were expected to be kids mischievous or smart-alecky or rebellious not trash-talking micro-adults schooled in the ways of the world. Individual specimens might have been precocious but as a species they were still allowed a certain measure of naivete; the jiggling blob of mass culture hadnt yet swallowed them whole. In this context Bad News Bears presented quite a shocker a portrait of farcically unskilled Little Leaguers hurling around profanities while their lethargic chain-smoking misanthropic coach sucked down perpetual cans of Schlitz. The film was PG in a time when PG had some edge (remember the poker game in E.T.?) but it still spawned sequels and became the prototype for countless kiddie sports flicks to follow from The Mighty Ducks to Kicking amp; Screaming. Strange because the original Bad News Bears was never really a kids movie. It was no more a kids movie than Tatum ONeal (as its airy pitching prodigy) was ever a child star. Richard Linklater a smart and perceptive director understands this irony and infuses his new film with the originals rough beginnings He doesnt soften things much aside from excising a few scenes in which children drink beer or smoke. The kids in this knowing tirelessly belligerent retread are as coarse and obnoxious as they ever were maybe more so. And therein lies the problem. Quips involving genitalia and sexual maturity and ethnic stereotypes are purposefully not-PC but political incorrectness long ago lost its backlash chic. Its old. And adding a kid in a wheelchair to the team solely to accommodate cripple jokes doesnt win the Bears or the film any new fans. Simply stated the shock has worn off. The context has changed since that antebellum era predating the culture wars. Seeing kids act horribly and talk like clogged plumbing isnt a novelty to audiences desensitized by South Park; if it ever seemed humorous if it ever looked cute it doesnt now no matter how often Carmen pops up on the soundtrack. So we have amply endowed strippers cheering from the stands. We have a minor pouring vodka for his soused coach. We have that same coach bringing his team to Hooters on a good day forcing them to exterminate rats on a bad one. Which is funnier the spectacle of a grown man corrupting children or hearing them call one another a particular dog-breeding term? Har-dee-har-har. The dissolute coach once played by an impossibly hangdog Walter Matthau is here portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton who emphasizes his characters low-rent dissipation -- and for all I know this is a Method technique -- by losing his jeans below his cheeks. If nothing else he and Matthau share the same air of skinny debauchment. The old ONeal role is assumed by Sammi Kraft whose hooded eyes and curtain of hair transform the ladylike sophisticate of the original into a sullen little tart. Linklater has often proved his skill with pungent verbiage (Before Sunset) but the update of Bill Lancasters mid-70s screenplay doesnt offer much beyond stroppy ballpark arguments and discomfiting sexual jokes. In the end I wondered who the film was for -- not children surely. Not their parents. Not anyone whos exhausted beyond help by underdog sports cliches. Thornton fans looking for more of Bad Santa might be appeased but even thats a stretch. ""Try to forgive an old drunk"" he implores his gloomy pitcher near the end and the good news is she does. The bad news is that no one cares. Todays Deals Open-Box Unlocked Galaxy S7 4G Android Phone for 420 + free...

Go if you must. Just dont take the family. No sense giving the kids more reason to resent you. After hearing Billy Bob Thornton invent 10 new ways to compare children to excrement the family will either hate you for taking them or hate themselves for staying to watch. And that would be terribly unfair because proper blame lies with the filmmakers who took an offbeat childrens classic and turned it bluer than a dockside bar at last call. Billy Bob Thornton now has ruined Christmas in ""Bad Santa"" and baseball here; whats next? ""Bad Pastor""? ""Bad Puppy Surgeon""? I realize there will be a cultural disconnect among some viewers of the movie. One side will praise Billy Bobs abrasive slacker as a post-modern hero. Many others will change that abrasive to abusive and dismiss the whole remake as a further coarsening of the culture. Ill include myself in that latter group. Director Richard Linklater has gone from pitch-perfect in the winningly rebellious ""School of Rock"" to tone deaf just two films later in ""Bad News Bears."" A few directors have launched a worthy assault on dumbed-down family movies - Danny Boyle with ""Millions"" to name one. Others seem to equate profanity with depth and darned if they arent two very different things. Walther Matthau in the beloved original was mean to his players but never really cruel. If he kept them at arms length it was to save them from his own problems and to avoid spilling his beer. Thornton and his directors have yet to master the subtlety between an endearing drunk and a sadist. It may be fashionably politically incorrect to say ""You guys swing like Helen Keller at a pinata party"" but its not exactly funny. Its a punchline to a bar joke not an honest moment with unruly children. Thorntons coach character cup-of-coffee major leaguer Morris Buttermaker might be redeemable if there were anyone likable to challenge his behavior. Yet his support team is a smarmy opposing coach (Greg Kinnear) a litigious hovering mom (Marcia Gay Harden) a handful of strippers with no speaking parts and the most regrettable cast of kids since ""Children of the Corn."" There is exactly one resonant scene between Buttermaker and his daughter (Sammi Kane Kraft). It arrives late in the movie and feels more like post-traumatic stress than earned emotion. The 1976 ""Bears"" so easily entered the lexicon of misfit winners that updating the cliche may well be impossible. The drunk lewd Buttermaker is hired by over-involved parents to coach the Bears a collection of losers kicked off the suburban leagues better teams. The rest is training montage booted grounders somehow becoming double plays while Thornton does little more than belch into his cooler. Breaks from the diamond come in the form of helping Buttermaker with his exterminators job; here again Linklater underscores his remakes shallowness. Matthaus dead-end job was a pool cleaner. This time around the rat-faced kids get to dump dead rodents and raccoons into Encinos finer trash bins. Im not sure I can quote a single line from the film. When Buttermakers not comparing the kids to his bowel movements hes suggesting sex games to the girls softball team. There was a brief moment of hope at the finale After fighting their way to respectability the Bears get a chance to show some class with their trophy. Instead they offer a rancid salute that would make Billy Martin blush. The best we can hope for is the little felons have learned a trick or two when it comes time to play prison ball. This crew makes the boys from ""The Longest Yard"" look like the Little Rascals. Staff writer Michael Booth can be reached at 303-820-1686 or mboothdenverpost.com.

"Easy to BEAR - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Easy to BEARBad News remake worth the replayBAD NEWS BEARS (star)(star)(star)July 22 2005|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic""Bad News Bears"" with Billy Bob Thornton as the booze-guzzling coach whose youth baseball team goes from ragtag to riches is one movie remake that doesnt need a defense attorney.If you were ever a kid who played baseball--and even if you only watched it--you probably have a soft spot for 1976s ""The Bad News Bears"" in which Walter Matthau perfectly played a salty old coach with a team of foul-mouthed kiddie misfits. And though you may be rightly worried about any Hollywood retreads Richard Linklaters good new ""Bears"" doesnt muff the assignment. The movie takes director Michael Ritchie and writer Bill Lancasters original subversive 70s classic and updates the whole shebang to modern times with relative ease and lots of laughs.Like the original this ""Bad News Bears"" centers on Morris Buttermaker (Thornton) its irascible sarcastic hard-drinking coach. In this version hes hired by fervent team mother and attorney Liz Whitewood (Marcia Gay Harden). Buttermaker--who spends his days as a lackadaisical pest-control exterminator (Matthau was a pool cleaner) and his nights hitting bars and trying to parlay his inning-long major league pitching career into quick pickups--is charged with firing up the Bears a team so terrible the league is considering rescinding their franchise.Why? Well one Bear Matthew Hooper (Troy Gentile) is playing in a wheelchair. The rest simply cant play well--or at all. Their woefully malfunctioning ranks include the feisty Agilar brothers Miguel and Jose (Carlos and Emmanuel Estrada) diminutive brawler Tanner Boyle (played by Timmy Deters) and Toby Whitewood (Ridge Canipe) who is attorney Lizs son.All have suspect skills and most have bad mouths. But worms can turn. After suffering through some slaughters--plus smug ridicule from the defending league champion Yankees and their clean-cut nasty coach Roy Bullock (Greg Kinnear) the Bears and Buttermaker get down to business with a new attitude and two new recruits fireballing 12-year old pitcher Amanda Whurlitzer (newcomer Sammi Kane Kraft in the Tatum ONeal role) and home-run blaster Kelly Leak (Jeffrey Davis).Soon theyre tearing up the league on track for the championship clash with the Yankees we all expect. But if that sounds like the same comic-inspirational sports movie people have kept making since the first ""Bad News Bears"" remember that this story plays it fast loose and subversive to the end.I wouldnt say that the new ""Bears"" is better than the old one nor even that Im completely sure ""Bears"" needed remaking. But at least its a good movie not the disgraceful witlessly modernized rip-off we have grown to expect from remakes like ""The Longest Yard."" Director-producer Linklater a maverick with heart (""School of Rock"") doesnt drop the ball.The first ""Bad News Bears"" hailed from an era when big studio releases were more human and adventurous and less hog-tied by technology and marketing than now--and this movie tries to relive the 70s. It also has the benefit of Thornton who zips himself right into Matthaus role of shaggy congenitally cynical Buttermaker. His sawed-off scowling smart-aleck persona and anti-pretty boy movie star looks make him spot-on for this part now.Linklater shows a lot of respect for Ritchies picture and so do writers Glenn Ficcara and John Requa. Theyve even included the name of the original writer the late Bill Lancaster in their credits (twice).If Matthau Ritchie Lancaster and the 1976 kids made something lastingly human raffish and funny out of the first ""Bad News Bears"" this remake keeps the string alive. Linklater one of the most humanly perceptive and anti-cliche of active American filmmakers always charges up the human element in his films including his non-stereotype teen comedy ""Dazed and Confused"" and his great romances ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset.""The public didnt go for ""Cinderella Man"" a real-life sports bio with depth and feeling. But maybe theyll like this saucy jokey spree. The new ""Bad News Bears"" may not make you cheer but it should provide laughs and a good time. Isnt that what some movies are all about?`Bad News Bears(star)(star)(star)Directed by Richard Linklater; written by Bill Lancaster Glenn Ficarra John Requa based on the film written by Lancaster; photographed by Rogier Stoffers; edited by Sandra Adair; production designed by Bruce Curtis; music by Edward Shearmur; music supervised by Randall Poster; produced by J.

"Salty talk peppers sluggish Bears remake - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Salty talk peppers sluggish Bears remake By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  July 22 2005 Back in 1976 there were critics who panned the original Bad News Bears"" because it relied on kids swearing to get laughs. Well duh. Pitched with the right spin a tyke letting fly with a juicy cuss can seem an honest admission of all the things were not supposed to say -- shock value as truth telling.But what was also a novelty 30 years ago is one more scrape across the senses in these coarser yet oddly more prim times. And so we have an exceedingly faithful 21st-century remake of Bad News Bears"" that amps up the verbal raunch while insisting that the young players of the worst Little League team in the San Fernando Valley are innocents at heart.The result is a sort of junior version of Bad Santa"" and not just because Billy Bob Thornton has been cast as coach Morris Buttermaker the reprobate ex-major leaguer played by Walter Matthau in the original. Thornton is easily the best thing about the new Bears."" Dangerous where Matthau was cuddly his Buttermaker has nothing remotely lovable about him and thats why we like him. But the remake is stranded between pushing the scatological envelope and caving in to the formulas the 1976 movie established and until the well-nigh foolproof ending it comes up gasping for air.First off you probably shouldnt take young children to this movie unless you want them coming out with friction burns on their ears. Our first sight of Buttermaker is in his day job as an exterminator telling a client No doubt about it lady you got a [expletive]-load of rats down there."" Before hitting the field to take charge of the Bears -- hes been hired after uptight yuppie single mom Liz Whitewood (Marcia Gay Harden) has sued the league to let the cast-offs play -- the new coach empties out a can of nonalcoholic beer and fills it with bourbon. Scoping out a girls softball team Buttermaker murmurs Look at the [expletive] on that second baseman."" These are the more printable lines of dialogue. There are also shout-outs to Hooters and the pleasures of sleeping with players mothers.The kids of course are even saltier especially pint-size thug Tanner (Timmy Deters) and oversize hulk Engelberg (Brandon Craggs). The rest of the team is a motley crew of space cadets (Tyler Patrick Jones) wheelchair kids (Troy Gentile) and hamhanded ethnic types (Indian Armenian Mexican). The setup is maximized for glorious political incorrectness -- and yet the movie just isnt funny. Thorntons mad-dog line readings are reliable for rude laughs but thats about it and in the yawning spaces between the jokes theres a sadness about the uncertain life these kids lead that the movie has no idea what to do with.The director sadly is Richard Linklater the Austin-based indie genius of Slacker"" and Dazed and Confused"" who proved with The School of Rock"" that he could play the studio game better than the hacks. Where Jack Blacks manic approach provided School"" with a motor though Thorntons too sneering and laid-back -- hes funny but at the expense of narrative momentum.The kids dont really pick up the slack. Theyre a cute but uncharismatic lot especially Jeff Davies as Kelly Leak the rebel teen with a power stroke. Sammi Kraft just mopes in the old Tatum ONeal role of Amanda Whurlitzer 12-year-old latchkey kid and fastball pitcher.Bad News Bears"" still comes to life once she shows up and the final game against the rival team led by preening suburban stud Ray Bullock (Greg Kinnear) sends you out on a decent high. Thornton plays it close enough to the vest that his transformation from win-at-all-costs jerk to caring coach is even believable and thats gravy in a movie like this. But the question dogging Bears"" remains unanswered. Not why was it made -- if the original is fun its no work of genius -- but who exactly is it for? Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"Bears turned loose on a new generation - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | MOVIE REVIEW Bears turned loose on a new generationThe original films delinquent heart still beats in the wild and woolly remake.July 22 2005|Carina Chocano | Times Staff Writer The remake of the 1976 kids classic ""The Bad News Bears"" is directed by the talented and prolific Richard Linklater. Why? Good question. ""Its the kind of film you couldnt get away with if it didnt have the successful lineage of the first film"" Linklater told Entertainment Weekly recently. ""If we didnt have the name Bad News Bears we couldnt be doing what we are doing."" He was referring no doubt to the prodigious underage swearing. And the Hooters scene. And the part where Billy Bob Thornton his expression hovering between modesty and childlike wonder confesses to Marcia Gay Harden that he hasnt paid for sex in years. Three days later I cant stop thinking about it. Its a perfect Buddhist conundrum To make an unmakable movie one must but remake it.Meditate on that.Linklater is on to something I think. Rather than sock us with another meta-elbow to the ribs (weve sustained more than is humane already and summer isnt even over) the director of ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" has rendered a straightforward surprisingly faithful and definitely loving adaptation of the original which starred Walter Matthau as a washed-up major league baseball player who gets hired to coach the worlds most hopeless Little League team. For The Record Los Angeles Times Saturday July 23 2005 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches; 39 words Type of Material Correction ""Bad News Bears"" -- A caption with the review of the movie ""Bad News Bears"" in Fridays Calendar section misidentified actor Timmy Deters as Sammi Kane Kraft. Kraft was not in the photograph as it appeared in the section.This time ""Bad News Bears"" stars Billy Bob Thornton as Morris Buttermaker once a pitcher for the Seattle Mariners (the experience lasted 2/3 of an inning) now an unreliable pest exterminator full-time drunk and the most inappropriate Little League coach ever. Buttermaker gets the job after Liz Whitewood (Harden) a lawyer and single alpha-mom sues the league for excluding her nonathletic son and wins. Having opened a Pandoras box of last-to-be-picked types she pays Buttermaker to take on the Bears a team that neither knows how to play nor particularly wants to. Theyre mostly there to satisfy their parents egos.Aside from stuffing it with jokes writers Glenn Ficurra and John Requa (""Bad Santa"") have preserved Bill Lancasters original script to the point where it feels like a throwback to another time -- specifically 1976 when a movie could be as cheerfully subversive as ""The Bad News Bears"" and still be considered appropriate for children. But that was 30 years and a million bike helmets ago. Despite their similarities the original still somehow feels like it was made for kids. The remake feels like it was made for people who were kids in 1976.Mainly this has to do with the cultural context. But theres also the rascally person of Billy Bob Thornton to consider. Matthaus Buttermaker was a lovable cranky drunk but Thorntons is another thing entirely. Lean gray-haired sporting a white-tipped Fu Manchu mustache and soul patch his cheerful dissipation attracts women like moths to a blowtorch. Not only is he seduced by the megalomaniac powerhouse Liz but like Snow White and her small woodland friends a cluster of frolicking strippers also seems to hover around him wherever he goes. If it werent for his daughter-figure Amanda (Sammi Kane Kraft) you might be tempted to think him shallow.Aside from Lizs pint-sized Toby (Ridge Canipe); the team consists of Engelberg (Brandon Craggs) the defensive fat kid; Tanner (Timmy Deters) the overly aggressive shrimpy kid; Miguel and Jose Agilar (Carlos and Emmanuel Estrada) Mexican brothers who dont speak English; Ahmad Abdul Rahim (Kenneth Harris) a black kid who is bad at sports; and Timmy Lupus (Tyler Patrick Jones) the much-maligned ""booger-eating moron."" Ficurra and Requa have modified the original to mock current pieties (the testy Engelberg is on Atkins which mostly means he keeps baggies of bacon in his pocket). The new Bears team also includes Hooper (Troy Gentile) the kid in the wheelchair; Prem (Aman Johal) the nerdy Indian kid with the laptop; and Garo Daragebrigadian (Jeffrey Tedmori) the Armenian kid whose dad ridicules his attempts to ""do American stuff.""At first Buttermaker is what you might call a laissez-faire coach. But when his annoyance with Roy Bullock (Greg Kinnear) the Lycra-loving sports dad who coaches the rival team reaches its limit Buttermaker quits passing out drunk on the pitchers mound and resolves to whip the Bears into shape. The first thing he does is look for Amanda (Kraft) his ex-girlfriends daughter whom he walked out on without saying goodbye. Amanda throws like a girl whos led several teams to championships (which Kraft has) and Buttermaker convinces her to join the team. Her presence in turn helps convince the talented Kelly Leak (Jeffrey Davies) a young Buttermaker in the buttermaking to join as well.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESScreening Room War films including The Dirty Dozen and...May 27 2010Up in the AirDecember 10 2009Moviegoers are waiting to see something newAugust 2 2005Bad News for filmgoers under age 10July 22 2005Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/22/entertainment/et-bears22,200,badnewsbears19,badnewsbears,latimes

With Billy Bob Thornton Greg Kinnear Sammi Kraft. Director Richard Linklater. (151) PG-13 Rude behavior Language throughout some sexuality amp; thematic elements. At area theaters. 3 Stars. Theres plenty of good news for the ""Bad News Bears"" Richard Linklaters remake of the hit 1976 comedy about an underdog sandlot team that comes out swinging. At least its good news to anyone who loved the subversive foulmouthed shock of ""Bad Santa."" This movie is a welcome Frankensteins monster - the raunchy brain of ""Bad Santa"" inside the politically incorrect body of ""Bad News Bears."" As it sparks to life spewing outrageous jokes at the expense of every race creed infirmity and sensibility viewers with G-rated hearts will run screaming while the other screams in the theater will be those of laughter. No one can replace Walter Matthau. But Billy Bob Thornton (who played that bad Santa in 2003) is scarily right for the role of Little League coach Morris Buttermaker a grizzled vulgar drunk who looks on his pint-size charges with disgust and the curiosity youd accord a bug before squishing it. (Buttermaker is an exterminator in his spare time so he has had practice.) The Bears are hopeless at first - too small fat stupid or otherwise inept to challenge the shiny squad coached by Roy Bullock (Greg Kinnear). The team exists thanks only to a lawsuit that forced the schools hand a delicious irony before a deluge of unspeakably un-politically correct dialogue from the mouths of babes and boobs alike. If you already know the drill for a movie like this its because the 1976 version spawned a generation of imitators that got progressively sappier. ""Bears"" respects the snap of the original The kids curse up a storm brawl as if their mothers honor depended on it and are scruffily lovable in unrepentant Dennis the Menace mode. The subtext about the curdling of the competitive spirit (in parents as well as kids) is even more topical today. The child actors are uneven. But I was particularly charmed by Timmy Deters as the thuggish Tanner a blond mop-top who hurls himself democratically at all comers the bigger the better. Theres also Brandon Craggs as Engelberg the fat kid on the team. At age 13 Craggs shows the comic skill and physical grace of some of the great comedians of girth like Jackie Gleason and Oliver Hardy. In her first-time acting Chloe Sevigny-lookalike Sammi Kraft plays the Tatum ONeal role of team tomboy. She steps up to the plate as does future dreamboat Jeff Davies as the bad-boy ringer they recruit for his arm and attitude. Thornton and Kinnear clash beautifully as the rival coaches but Marcia Gay Harden suffers in an embarrassing stock role as a sex-starved single mom. Another downer The direction of Linklater (""School of Rock"") is not always effective with some scenes petering out as if shot by Buttermaker on a bender. But the strong script (with updated flourishes by ""Bad Santa"" writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa) and some of the vibrant child characters pull it through with the comically reptilian Thornton egging them on with one inappropriate shocker after another. Buttermaker compares baseball to dating unresponsive ""German chicks"" takes the kids to Hooters gets them uniforms advertising a strip club. The movie is rated a hard - very hard - PG-13. The original ""Bad News Bears"" was likewise never about hearts and flowers. The script was by Burt Lancasters son Bill whose childhood polio caused his heart to give out at age 49. It takes someone on the inside of physical frailty to write a movie so mordantly funny and unsentimental about kids who when pushed push back with all their might and lungs.

Thornton had starred as another drunken foul-mouthed protagonist in ""Bad Santa"" while Linklater was coming off his 2003 comedy about lovable pre-teen misfits ""The School of Rock."" While this extremely faithful adaptation doesnt disgrace the beloved memory of Michael Ritchies 1976 hit (which spawned two sequels and a TV series) it doesnt exactly stand out in this summers endless parade of needless remakes which include Paramounts two most recent releases ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Honeymooners."" Stepping into the formidable cleats of Walter Matthau Thornton offers a watered-down PG-13-rated version of his ""Bad Santa"" character as Morris Buttermaker a washed-up ex-ballplayer who spent two-thirds of an inning in the Major Leagues. Now working as an exterminator Buttermaker accepts a cash payment from a parent to coach the Bears a group of athletically challenged young misfits (including one in a wheelchair and a computer geek) who were admitted to a youth league under threat of a lawsuit. As updated by ""Bad Santa"" writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa Linklaters version closely follows the excellent plot laid down by original writer Bill Lancaster. After the Bears are humiliated in their first games Buttermaker recruits a ringer Amanda the daughter of an ex-girlfriend whom hed turned into an excellent pitcher. Amanda helps him recruit a second ringer Kelly a juvenile delinquent whos also a phenomenal player. Thirteen-year-old Sammi Kane Kraft who plays Amanda may actually be able to pitch a ball at 70 mph but she clearly cant deliver lines like Tatum ONeal who nailed the part in 76. And Jeff Davies Kelly doesnt have the kind of scene-stealing menace that Jackie Earle Haley displayed in the earlier version. Except for Timmy Deters as the sarcastic Tanner the casting is comparatively inferior all the way down the line. It isnt just the kids A miscast Greg Kinnear has twice the amount of screen time Vic Morrow had as the overbearing coach of a rival team but has half the impact. In the original Buttermaker was hired by a dad. This time in the biggest departure the check comes from a single mom (badly mugging Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden) with whom he has a newly invented romantic liaison. Though Linklater goes as far as retaining the use of music from the opera ""Carmen"" from the original he fails to maintain Ritchies smooth pacing This new choppier version clocks in a full 10 minutes longer and feels it. Ritchies movie was genuinely subversive and hilarious; Linklaters despite amped-up sexual references (the team celebrates at Hooters) is merely a passably amusing excuse to pass a couple of hours in an air-conditioned theater. -- BAD NEWS BEARS [] (Two stars) Tatum come back. Running time 114 minutes. Rated PG- 13 (rude behavior and language sexual references and drinking). At the E- Walk the Chelsea the Coliseum others.

It oozes from his pores and erupts from his potty mouth. Not since Robert Mitchum has an actor worn lewdness like cologne. Thornton the nations Id Boy fairly reeks of the sack and the sauce.Now I dont much care for Bad News Bears a relatively faithful update of the 1976 film where beer-guzzling Walter Matthau coaches a Little League team of misfits who swear like stevedores. But Thornton Oh my badness He swills the Matthau role with the unslakable thirst of W.C. Fields and idiosyncratic sexuality of Johnny Depp. So this is what Bad Santa does during the off-season.Curiously Thorntons subversive performance as the type of guy parents warn their kids to stay away from is in this PG-13 movie a tad too profane for the preteens who would really dig it and too juvenile for most adults.Who then is the audience? Teenagers and their parents who might be amused at how the film from Richard Linklater (School of Rock) takes aim at all-American hypocrisy and political correctness. The type that preaches ""it doesnt matter whether you win or lose but how you play the game"" but practices ruthless competition (personified by smiling cobra Greg Kinnear) is the villain here. As are the litigious parents (embodied by Marcia Gay Harden) who sue the city to win their special-needs kids a spot on the Little League roster and then fail to come to the games.As Morris Buttermaker an exterminator who looks as if hes been huffing fumigant Thornton is the heretic who makes piety look sham. He may be shaggy but hes no hypocrite. Listen to him instill team spirit into his 12-year-old charges ""Baseballs hard. You can love it but it doesnt always love you back - kinda like a German chick.""This is pretty typical of Bad News Bears rewriters (and Bad Santa screenwriters) Glenn Ficarra and John Requa FDOTFL (fall-down-on-the-floor-laughing) for adults of a certain warp; IDGI (I dont get it) for everyone else.Buttermaker a guy more usually found pacifying frisky rats and friskier Hooters girls has accepted the gig as coach because once upon a time he played (two-thirds of an inning) in the majors.As he did in School of Rock Linklater infuses Bears with the belief that it takes a misfit to teach a misfit.With two exceptions the younger actors here seem cowed by Thornton. Though shes no Tatum ONeal (who held her own against Matthau in the original) Sammi Kane Kraft has a scorching fastball as Bears pitcher Amanda Whurlitzer daughter of a Buttermaker ex. And Jeffrey Davies exudes heartthrob appeal as Kelly Leak a Sk8er Boi with a bad attitude and a great batting average.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickeyat 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.Read her recent work at http//go.philly.com/carrierickey.Bad News Bears (out of four stars)Produced by J.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Remakes are always tricky propositions. Usually the only films that need to be remade are the bad ones but the only films that do get remade are the good ones. The strongest remakes such as last years politically incisive The Manchurian Candidate update the material with a renewed sense of purpose while the worst are just pale retreads uninspired and unnecessary. Richard Linklaters Bad News Bears a faithful ""remix"" of the raunchy 1976 underdog comedy does nothing to justify its own existence other than be consistently funny from start to finish. Its the exception to the rule a relaxed and confident piece of formula filmmaking that could fairly be viewed as redundant yet works like an electrifying cover band. With a wickedly sardonic Billy Bob Thornton ideally cast in the Walter Matthau role the film plays like the progeny of Thorntons Bad Santa and Linklaters School Of Rock. A salty inappropriateness tempers the underlying sweetness of all three. Taking little edge off his malevolent mall Santa routine Thornton plays another belligerent drunk who speaks to young children with the same tone he uses on anyone else killing his buzz or aggravating his hangover. A former major league washout Thornton decides to supplement his rodent extermination business by coaching a Little League team so hapless that it needed a court injunction to hit the field. A motley group of nerds runts ethnic outcasts and the chronically uncoordinated the Bears are bad players and even lousier sports given to either defeated moping or nasty brawls. After last years champions coached by power dad Greg Kinnear beat and taunt them mercilessly in the first game Thornton and the players resolve to get better and exact some revenge helped along by a couple of ringers Thorntons estranged daughter (Sammi Kraft) and a hard-hitting juvenile delinquent (Jeff Davies). Eventually Bad News Bears has to go through the same paces as all underdog sports movies with skills improved and opponents bested and lessons learned though Linklater loads the requisite montages with funny little grace notes. But the film is at its sharpest in the early going when neither Thornton nor the kids are anywhere close to enlightened and they spend profane afternoons in the sun bickering and blundering around the diamond. School Of Rock announced Linklater as a gifted director of child actors and the members of the young cast hes assembled here all emerge with distinct personalities that bounce off one another harmoniously. In their refusal to press too hard for laughs Linklater and Thornton make a natural duo both low-key Southerners high on ingratiating charm. They give no reason to reject a generous comedy like Bad News Bears no matter how superfluous the project may seem.

In Bad News Bears director Richard Linklaters swell fair-ball remake of the well-loved anti-PC 1976 sports comedy Thornton picks up the Beer Can of Unwilling Leadership from Walter Matthau to play Morris Buttermaker a seedy washout of a onetime ballplayer scrounged up to coach a gaggle of kid-size athletic misfits into becoming a youth baseball team. Linklater and jovially dyspeptic screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (they wrote Bad Santa -- their crud cred is good) know enough to leave Bill Lancasters original structure alone. (They also wisely retain the goofy grandeur of a soundtrack driven by Bizets opera Carmen -- ole.) Instead the tweaks are subtle and unobtrusive as Linklater -- proven in School of Rock to be a natural leader of yoots -- brings transgression up to code for the 21st century of PG-13. New-era losers (the cast is a cheery scrum of relaxed kids led by genuine whiz pitcher Sammi Kane Kraft in the role created by Tatum ONeal) now include a rotten kid in a wheelchair. And Greg Kinnear provides bonus smarm as Buttermakers nemesis a coach with a high regard for his own crotch.

Faithfully retelling the 1976 comedy about a team of misfits and their slovenly beer-swilling coach the new ""Bad News Bears"" has adopted a somewhat raunchier tone but delivers enough laughs to go the distance. Billy Bob Thornton hews toward ""Bad Santa"" territory as he neatly slides into Walter Matthaus shoes while the rest of the cast alas doesnt measure up. Too crude for younger kids pics sweet spot should be among teens and young adults who werent even born when the first tykes-behaving-badly exercise took the field. Director Richard Linklater struggles a bit with pacing (pic is 10 minutes longer than its predecessor and feels it) but Thorntons woozy delivery and the engaging subject matter mostly hold up. Working from a script credited to original scribe the late Bill Lancaster and ""Bad Santa"" alums Glenn Ficarra and John Requa the changes prove largely cosmetic ranging from finding a new if equally inappropriate team sponsor (though its predecessor is briefly shown) to altering the protagonists day job from pool cleaner to pest control man. Thornton plays Morris Buttermaker a blink-and-you-missed-him big league pitcher who grudgingly agrees to coach a group of thrown-together kids in a hyper-competitive baseball league. Slightly sweetened to augment the political incorrectness the roster now includes a lad in a wheelchair (Troy Gentile) as well as a nerd (Prem Lahiri) who doesnt know much about baseball but proves a whiz with batting percentages. Greg Kinnear meanwhile is more smarmy than sinister (Vic Morrow you are missed) as the overbearing coach of the leagues perennial champs reflecting just how prescient the originals underlying theme about over-involved parents was. Brought in this time by a working single mom (Marcia Gay Harden) Buttermaker slowly begins to embrace the challenge of turning the Bears into winners. The turnaround stems from recruiting the fireballing 12-year-old girl (Sammi Kane Kraft) he taught to throw a mean slider while dating her mother and taking in a rebel (Jeffrey Davies) whose hobbies are upgraded from arcades to skateboarding. Theres no nice way to say this but the quality of the kid performers is at best uneven and drags the pic down in the middle innings. A notable exception would be Timmy Deters as the diminutive and ever-combative Tanner who bears such an uncanny resemblance to the character in the previous ""Bears"" one might suspect human cloning is involved. Still its Thorntons show and he drolly rattles off plenty of incongruously funny lines from suggesting that baseball is ""like dating a German chick"" to complaining hes been saddled with coaching ""bronze medalists in the Special Olympics."" Pic also makes good use of its San Fernando Valley locations which in a not-so-subtle bit of product placement have been updated to include post-game festivities at Hooters. At a time when every third summer movie seems to be a remake ""Bad News Bears"" is one of those rare concepts actually suited to an encore since the ideas of outcast kids and parents living vicariously through their children remain current enough to account for much of the Bravo channels primetime lineup. And though remakes are seldom hailed as good news creatively they can at least be good company.
