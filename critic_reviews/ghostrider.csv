Sadly the results of that collaboration are ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" which sees Neveldine and Taylor succumbing to the Curse of Cage rendering what might have been a gloriously loony concept into a fairly pedestrian supernatural action flick shot in some of the less attractive corners of budget-friendly Eastern Europe. This is a movie about a flaming skeleton that rides a motorcycle -- theres no excuse for it to be this dull. Also read Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance to Battle Safe House for No. 1 Box Office Spot In the previous ""Ghost Rider"" movie (and in the Marvel Comics that spawned it) stunt rider Johnny Blaze (Cage) became Satans errand boy as the result of a deal to save the life of Johnnys dying father. (And you know how deals with the devil turn out.) The first movie ended with Johnny being let out of the bargain but choosing to keep his hell-born powers so that he could use them for good. Thats just one of many plot elements that ""Spirit of Vengeance"" chooses to ignore. (Also absent this time around are Eva Mendes as Johnnys true love as well as Johnnys affection for the music of The Carpenters.) In the sequel/reboot Johnny wants the Ghost Rider exorcised because he has no control over the creature and cannot stop it from taking away the souls of anyone with whom it comes into contact. Boozy priest Moreau (Idris Elba) finds Johnny somewhere in Romania and offers to drive the Ghost Rider from his soul in exchange for Johnny finding young Danny (Fergus Riordan) and handing him over for safe-keeping. Danny and his mother Nadya (the oxymoronically-named Violante Placido) have been on the run from black-SUV-driving goons out to take the kid on behalf of the creepy Roarke (Ciaran Hinds) the guy with whom Johnny once made his dark pact. (Another switcheroo from the first movie.) Also read Ghost Rider 2 Poised to Ignite a Lackluster Franchise That should be enough to let the directors go buck-wild with one eye-popping chase and fight sequence after another but the action is oddly muted. For directors best known for two movies about a guy who has to keep his heart from stopping theres a decided absence of adrenaline here. Even Cage seems restrained except for one gloriously hammy scene in which Blaze tries to keep the Ghost Rider from emerging -- its a Jekyll-and-Hyde moment thats insanely absurd and overdone yes but it winds up standing out as one of the films best sequences solely for not succumbing to the tameness that blankets the rest of the movie. Usually you can count on the slumming British actors in movies like this to bother to give a performance but not here Elba staggers around with a Pepe LePew-level French accent (his pronunciation of ""vengeance"" is pretty hilarious granted) while Hinds does the kind of embarrassing acting usually associated with...well Nicolas Cage. ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" doesnt just fail to live up to the original ""Ghost Rider"" -- its not even a very good Nicolas Cage movie. Youll actually have a better time renting ""Trespass"" or ""Drive Angry"" instead. And thats saying something. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Photo Credit Columbia Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Supernatural superhero Johnny Blaze returns this time to save a child wanted by the Devil. RATING PG-13 (violence language gruesome imagery) BOTTOM LINE Surprisingly entertaining with impressive visuals snazzy directing and another gonzo acting job from Cage. CAST Nicolas Cage Ciaran Hinds Violante Placido LENGTH 136 If you think youve seen Nicolas Cage overact you havent seen ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" the sequel to 2007s ""Ghost Rider"" itself a high-water mark in Cages emotive career. Reprising his role as possessed biker Johnny Blaze Cage leaves no neck tendon unpopped whenever he transforms into The Rider a flaming skeleton cackling atop a roaring Hog. Perhaps you expected as much from Cage (""Drive Angry"" ""Bangkok Dangerous"") but you might be surprised at how enjoyable ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" manages to be. The best stuntmen in this action flick are its directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (""Crank"" ""Gamer"") who inject the movie with unrelenting violence yet never tip into gratuitous splatter -- a nifty way of retaining a PG-13 rating for their target audience. The result is an entertaining slice of teenage heavy-metal heaven. advertisement | advertise on newsday The first film is essentially forgotten Theres a new Devil Roarke (Ciaran Hinds nearly out-Caging Cage) and no mention of Johnnys old sweetheart (Eva Mendes). A new woman Nadia (Violante Placido) is mostly a plot device Shes the mother of young Danny (Fergus Riordan) whom Johnny is trying to save from Roarkes clutches. Idris Elba plays Moreau a gun-toting priest who joins the mission. There are gruesome but cartoony deaths. But Neveldine-Taylor as theyre professionally known are focused on spectacle filling the screen with flaming machinery and massive clouds of tar-black smoke. Theyre having so much fun setting everything on fire that they forget to put Nadia the films only female in a revealing outfit.

This bland new money-spinner from the Marvel Comics stable manages to notch up a level of camp that makes Batman and Robin look like it was directed by Bergman. Nic Cage seems comfortable in the role of the flaming-skulled biker but the plot holes are too deep even for his Herbie-like arachnid motorcycle to negotiate. Stock bad guys characterised by their dirty teeth and sodden leather jackets are all dispatched in a painfully lacklustre manner while the voluptuous Eva Mendes who plays Blazes spurned belle seems to have been contractually obliged to reveal as much of her ample bosom as the rating will allow. Naturally the ending tees up a sequel but youre still no clearer as to who or what Ghost Rider is. At least with X-Men and Fantastic Four the characters are easily identifiable by their related superpower. Ghost Rider it appears has been bestowed with the ability to set his head on fire and look into peoples souls to turn their past evils against them; not the most useful skill when youre fighting an all-or-nothing war with the Devils son (Wes Bentley). Theres also a certain irony to the fact that Peter Fonda - known for his turn in Easy Rider as the dope-smuggling outlaw who casually flicked a mid-digit towards corporate America from the helm of his glistening Chopper - turns up here as the Devil.

"Ghost Rider Hells um Devils washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Ghost Rider Hells um Devils Fooom Nicolas Cage cant shoot his way out of this biker-gunslinger flick. (By Jasin Boland -- Columbia Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday February 17 2007 ""Ghost Rider"" is a compelling image in search of a movie. The image is I suppose every bad-boy bikers idealized vision of himself a slinky hellish black-leathered and jeaned knight on a gleamy chopper with angel-wing bars and a teardrop fuel tank. He looks like a chromed angel of death or a cowboy gunslinger in the key of motorcycle as he churns across plain and through city leaving a ribbon of flame in his tracks. And -- heres the best part -- his head is on fire. I havent seen a good ""his head is on fire"" movie in a long time maybe never but now Im aching to see some more. Anybody got any suggestions? Do I have to wait for the sequel ""His Head Is on Fire 2"" before I get my wish? Darn I hate it when that happens. Anyhow ""Ghost Rider"" is on somewhat shakier ground as a narrative. Nicolas Cage who should know better plays Johnny Blaze an Evelish Knievelish stunt jock who makes a nice living punching his bike so hard off a ramp it leaps not tall buildings but rows and rows of trucks and even helicopters with swerving rotors ready to grind him to cornflakes at a single bound. Hes a second generationer in this line of work having learned the flying trade from his dad who one day tried to fly too far and was brought low for it. But that was after Johnny inked a contract with Old Scratch in order to save his dad from the cancer that was eating his lungs. It was the Devils trick to get Johnny to sign then take the old man via different means And this was a devil you thought you could trust too. He looks just like Young Mr. Lincoln. (How many of you kids get the joke? Dont raise your hands at once.) In any event many years later with Johnny grown up the Devil (Peter Fonda get it?) wants the due Johnny cheated him out of in the first place; though a fraud the contract is still binding. It seems that theres trouble in Hell. The Devils evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and three pals (angels of air water and I couldnt figure out the last guy maybe just ugliness) want to take over the ranch. Politics politics everythings politics Thus the Devil commissions Johnny as a ""Ghost Rider"" which means his job is to take down the bad boys; if he does that he gets his soul back; if not he goes on the rotisserie until the sun turns into a popsicle. Hmm what follows are a lot of loud chaotic action sequences for an audience acculturated more to NASCAR tractor pulls demo derbies and that show on Discovery in which the father curses his adult sons while they build custom choppers. Over and over director Mark Steven Johnson returns to the image of the ghost rider head blazing roaring hellishly through the darkness trailing gossamers of oxidation. Johnny has to fight each of the bad guys in various heavy-metal ways -- chains seem to be the weapon of choice -- and the effects though hardly believable are quite energetic. I suppose theres some resemblance to a plot even if I could never quite figure out where Sam Elliott fit in. He seemed to be a graveyard attendant and religious eschatology adviser an odd confluence of occupations even by Hollywood standards. Also along to pose dramatically in silhouette to show off the more salient aspects of her talent is Eva Mendes who pouts and flirts as the inevitable TV reporter and ex-girlfriend. Mainly the movies about riding a bike at the speed of sound while your head is burning. They can do anything these days which isnt quite the same as saying they should do anything these days. Ghost Rider (105 minutes at area theaters) is PG-13 for stylized violence and random fire.

As Johnny Blaze a daredevil biker who sells his soul becoming the vengeful Ghost Rider Nicolas Cage passes off droopiness as acting. The Ghost Rider himself makes for a nifty image with a skull that pokes out of his spiked leather jacket and pops into flames like a cigarette lighter. But everything else in Ghost Rider(the story the visual energy Peter Fonda channeling Jack Nicholson as the devil) is so much flatter than it was on the comic-book page that an image is all he is.

Comments (1) Ghost Rider As those Christmas videos of burning logs prove flame has a magic all its own and this Marvel Comics adaptation is aided by its hero being frequently on fire. Played by Nicolas Cage hes a motorcycle stunt rider who strikes a deal with Mephistopheles (Easy Rider star Peter Fonda) and to hold up his end of the bargain must periodically transform into the title character--a skeleton in biker leathers with flames licking off his skull--and track down the devils prey. The story doesnt arc so much as unspool like a stretch of desert highway but the Ghost Rider is such a powerful amalgam of hot-rod iconography that this is still fairly watchable. Mark Steve Johnson (Daredevil) directed his own script; with Eva Mendes and Sam Elliott. PG-13 114 min. By J.R.

Comic-book adventure about a motorcycle stunt rider who sells his soul to the Devil and turns into a flaming bounty hunter. With Nicolas Cage Eva Mendes. Director Mark Steven Johnson (150). PG-13 Action violence. At area theaters. Rarely in Hollywood have so many labored so hard with so much time and such financial resources to fill a movie screen with as vast an array of spiritual gibberish literary poppycock and pure flummery as Mark Steven Johnsons ""Ghost Rider."" But I overpraise. Nicolas Cage having squandered most of his goodwill from his 1995 Oscar for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" goes ""all in"" for what is likely to be the first and last entry in the ""Ghost Rider"" franchise and yet a project bound for the pantheon of ""good"" bad movies. Cage plays Johnny Blaze a famous motorcycle stunt man who as a kid gets tricked into selling his soul and - 45 minutes later in movie time - learns that he is now the Devils bounty hunter. His job assigned by Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) himself is to stop Mephs rebellious son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) from replacing him as the Prince of Darkness. Johnnys powers are amazing and - in the general sense of good and evil - contradictory. At night and in the presence of evil his head turns into a flaming skull his hands light up like campfire marshmallows and he can both see the evil in mens eyes and punish them for it He also has a supernatural motorcycle that comes to his whistle just like Roy Rogers horse Trigger. Naturally there is a girl involved or at least her cleavage. Its hard to know from her wardrobe and the cameramans aim whether Eva Mendes as the TV reporter in love with Johnny is part of the cast or the visual design. The action scenes to which everything leads pit flaming J.B. against Blackheart and his scraggly trio of soulless sidekicks - a character made of water another of wind and a third of rocks or something hard to know. In any case the movie is 120 million worth of computer-generated spaghetti thrown at the wall. What sticks is a colorful mesmerizing at times breathtaking mess - its like watching a bonfire on acid - and what slides to the floor is well you probably dont want to know.

"Ghost Rider | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ghost-rider ) Ghost Rider (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli In the world of comic books there are A-list titles and B-list titles. For the movie adaptations its easy to tell the two apart. The B-list films feature characters who are not universally recognizable typically do not command huge budgets and are released outside of the prime summer months of May through July. Ghost Rider is such a movie. Despite an incredibly silly premise the comic was popular at one time possibly because of the cool image presented by the title character. With its cheesy special effects and blasphemously imbecilic storyline one wonders whether the celluloid version of Ghost Rider will find an audience. Comic books and theology rarely mix and when they do its usually not a comfortable mA(c)lange. This is the case with Ghost Rider in which the unlikely scenario occurs whereby a servant of Satan becomes the apparent weapon of God. To further muddle things the Devil isnt really that bad at least when compared to his son Blackheart. Most of the time stories about characters who sell their souls to Mephistopheles have a moral. In this case its that God gives second chances to those who save the human race from supernatural annihilation. Daniel Webster he isnt. As a young man Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) makes a pact with the Devil (Peter Fonda). Its a simple deal Johnny gives up his soul and Prince of Evil cures Johnnys father of cancer. Years later Johnny is the worlds top stuntman a modern-day Evel Knievel - except he emerges alive and unscathed from even the most insane motorcycle jumps. He cant die - the Devil owns him. For decades Mephistopheles leaves Johnny alone. But when Satans son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) decides to make Earth his dominion Johnny becomes Ghost Rider - a leather clad biker with a flaming skull for a head. His duty defeat Blackheart and his three minions save Johnnys old flame Roxanne (Eva Mendes) from the clutches of evil and return balance to the world. By now anyone reading this has probably gotten the idea that Ghost Rider isnt in the same league as Spider-Man The X-Men Superman or Batman (unless were referring to the Man of Steel in Superman IV or the Caped Crusader in Batman and Robin). Maybe this ""origin story"" worked in the pages of the Ghost Rider comic book (I never was much of a fan truth be told) but its laughable on screen. Admittedly one expects a certain level of preposterousness from a superhero story but this film is far too silly to be taken seriously on any level. And the pedestrian predictability of the action sequences isnt a saving factor. Watch as Ghost Rider battles the minions one-by-one before facing off against Blackheart at the climax. Nicolas Cage plays Johnny with an off-kilter intensity that makes for a strangely sympathetic portrayal. Eva Mendes is effective in the girlfriend role although it doesnt take much to satisfy the requirements act amazed when confronted with the truth get captured and need rescuing and have a sexy/macho shot that will cause heart palpitations for teenage male viewers. These two dont have the chemistry of a Peter Parker and Mary Jane or a Lois and Clark but theyll do in a pinch. Meanwhile Peter Fonda wears makeup that causes him to look embalmed while providing a voice that sounds like a bad Clint Eastwood impersonation. And Sam Elliott has a small part that would take about five paragraphs to explain. His most notable contribution is that he has the perfect voice for the voiceover narration. This is director Mark Steven Johnsons second foray into the realm of Marvel B-list heroes. He previously directed Ben Affleck in 2003s Daredevil another February release. The earlier movie had fewer special effects which is probably a good thing since whats on display in Ghost Rider isnt impressive. With new Spider-Man and Fantastic Four movies just around the corner superhero fans dont have to rely on this feature for their fix. Thats fortunate because Ghost Rider is an unholy mess.

Starring Nicolas Cage Eva Mendes Peter Fonda Sam Elliott and Wes Bentley. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson. (PG-13. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Its fascinating to watch an actor who thinks hes in a good film when hes really in a bad one. Perhaps Nicolas Cage was trying to elevate ""Ghost Rider"" with the power of his performance. Or maybe he had no idea how silly his character would look when the special-effects people were done -- as if someone poured lighter fluid on the skeleton from your seventh-grade science class. ""Ghost Rider"" has everything you dont want from your superhero movie including lack of logic boring action scenes bad acting in the supporting performances a brutally slow 114-minute running time and cringe-worthy dialogue. The movie also unfortunately does a lot to undo the recent goodwill that ""Batman Begins"" ""Sin City"" ""A History of Violence"" and ""V for Vendetta"" have built toward this underappreciated genre of films. If ""300"" doesnt kick supreme butt next month people might ditch ""graphic novel"" from their lingo and start calling them ""comic books"" again. Related Stories REVIEW / Nicolas Cage tries but too bad -- the Ghost Rider cant save his own movie ""Ghost Rider"" sticks pretty close to the cult favorite comic which focuses on the story of Johnny Blaze an Evel Knievel-like stunt rider who sells his soul to the devil and turns into a motorcycle-riding yule log whenever its dark out and hes in the presence of evil. After a long beginning that covers how Blaze got his powers -- easily the best part of the movie -- he becomes a ""bounty hunter for rogue demons"" including a devil-spawn named Black Heart. Rolling through the streets on a flaming bike breaking windows and scarring pavement along the way Blaze tries to control his powers and make some good out of his bad situation. Its close to the classic werewolf story except with biker and Western themes which should be really awesome. Unfortunately writer-director Mark Steven Johnsons dialogue is Hallmark-horrible (""He may have my soul. But he doesnt have my spirit"") the romance is filled with ""Threes Company""-style misunderstandings the effects are occasionally ridiculous and the lack of logic is often distracting. (Without pulling out actuarial tables it seems sort of pointless when the Ghost Rider causes approximately 50 million in property damage just to rid the world of one mugger.) At least Cage does everything right taking his already polished Elvis imitation and tweaking it a bit making the character eccentric -- he listens to the Carpenters and watches too much bad TV -- while still seeming cool and heroic. People criticize Cage for playing too many action characters after winning a best actor Oscar for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" but its hard to find flaws with his actual performances. He single-handedly makes this movie worth watching for free on cable. As good as Cage is in ""Ghost Rider"" the rest of the actors are lacking. Peter Fonda plays the devil and while the ""Easy Rider"" reference might have been kind of cool the first time you saw a ""Ghost Rider"" commercial hes horribly miscast. The hotness of Eva Mendes as Blazes love Roxanne is impossible to deny. (And impossible to miss -- the camera seems to focus on her cleavage every time shes in a scene. Im not 100 percent certain her head was ever in the movie.) But shes even more distracting than Fonda playing one of the worst TV news reporters ever. Even KRON would probably fire her for incompetence. Also for your Razzie Award consideration is Wes Bentley as the main bad guy Black Heart although to be fair much of the problem is his makeup. Robert Smith of the Cure is cool but he doesnt have the type of look that strikes fear in audiences. Everyone who watched ""X-Men"" knows that the best graphic novel bad guys look like James Hetfield from ""Metallica."" -- Advisory This film contains violence adult language and some disturbing images. Example In one scene Nicolas Cage appears to be wearing Ricardo Montalbans fake chest from ""Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan"" which really should be hanging in the Smithsonian where it belongs.

Placed alongside such primetime Sony/Marvel Comics movies as the ""Spider-Man"" franchise ""Ghost Rider"" is strictly matinee material. Though the superheros fans have long awaited his close-up the Devils bounty hunter -- complete with a burning skull for a head and a killer motorcycle in flames -materializes in a movie that never measures up to his infernal potential. Yet another lucrative day-in-the-park job for Nicolas Cage typifies pics constant feeling of routine while Sonys day-and-date release in several international markets is a savvy way to collect as much coin as soon as possible before the fires go out. ""Ghost Rider"" would have been most fun had it been made for a dime by a Roger Corman-type outfit as a quickie Gothic adventure spinning Zane Grey ""Faust"" and Evel Knievel. In other words precisely the kind of project studios simply cant make anymore. Pic also would have been more enjoyable had Mark Steven Johnson not been tempted to both write and direct. Young motorcycle stunt driver Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) is following in the tiremarks of his dad Barton (Brett Cullen) but when he learns that dad is dying of cancer Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) comes calling. His Faustian bargain Johnnys soul for Bartons full recovery. Bartons ensuing fatal accident wasnt part of the deal and even a budding romance with Roxanne (Raquel Alessi) doesnt stop the broken-hearted Johnny from hitting the road. Dissolve to Johnny as a grown-up Nicolas Cage having far out-paced Bartons modest carnival act with a huge arena show in which he jumps dozens of trucks and even a football field full of Black Hawk helicopters. (Those tempted to compare the movies own beefed-up self to its true pulp origins can insert thoughts here.) What astounds Team Blaze led by Mack (Donal Logue) is how Johnny pushes so far beyond the envelope in stunt after stunt while remaining unscathed. Prelude (narrated by the great sandy voice of Sam Elliott) about a ghost rider out of the Old West comes full circle with the arrival of Blackheart (Wes Bentley) Mephistopheles ungrateful and soulless son aiming to get the devils contract that the old ghost rider took for his own and buried somewhere. With said contract Blackheart can supposedly suck up evil souls to dominate the planet. Looking like a grown version of Butch Patrick Billy Mummy in ""The Munsters"" saddled with many of pics uproariously lousy lines and urged to overplay every moment Bentley has too many deficits going in to be a genuine threat to Cages Johnny once Mephistopheles recruits his bounty-hunting services. This of course complicates Johnnys stabs at renewing the love thing with Roxanne who reappears in the form of Eva Mendes as an ""Eyewitness News""-style Lois Lane covering local stories. After a protracted 40 minutes final hour at least gets down to the main event pitting Ghost Rider vs. Blackheart and his easily dispatched gang of angel rejects in a series of nighttime bouts (our hero vampire-like spouts a skull and flames only after sunset) some of them in the middle of the unnamed city finishing with an effects-heavy battle in a Mexican ghost town. Crucial to Ghost Riders powers -- and his victory over Blackheart -- is his ability to grab a bad guy and force him to feel the pain of the souls hes harmed. A wittier writer could have mined much amusement between Johnny and Roxanne and a keen-eyed director could have turned pics contests and exchanges into dazzling bouts of evil vs. highly compromised good. But on both fronts Johnsons work smacks of pure recycling from other better superhero adventures. Even the promise of new effects feels tired here with nothing that hasnt been seen before (such as several repeated effects involving sand dirt and decay) in for example ""The Mummy"" movies. Lacking any pleasurable chemistry with the miscast Mendes who looks mostly nonplussed by all the Mephistophelean goings-on Cage is allowed to have a few moments of subversive comedy in an otherwise stunningly bland role. Image of Ghost Riders fiery hog may have inspired the hiring of Easy Rider Fonda who keeps his scenes crisp and mean. Elliott providing the load of pics expository background is the acting equivalent of a nice swig of whiskey. Oz production locales are never betrayed in a story set in Texas and production designer Kirk M. Petrucelli and lenser Russell Boyd capture pics contrasting big-city environs and Western exteriors.

"The stars might wish Ghost Rider disappears - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW The stars might wish Ghost Rider disappears Nicolas Cage (left) and Sam Elliott in ""Ghost Rider. (JASIN BOLAND) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  February 17 2007 Hark Whats that agonized shrieking rending the air? Is it the screams of the undead as their souls are consumed by the flames of the pit?Close enough. Its the talented cast of ""Ghost Rider"" trying to act their way out of the movie.Nicolas Cage Eva Mendes Peter Fonda Sam Elliott ""American Beauty"" discovery Wes Bentley indie slacker Donal Logue -- oh the carnage . How they all ended up in this goofy piece of Marvel Comics piffle about a flame-headed cycle-ridin emissary of Satan is a mystery best left to their agents.""Ghost Rider"" is the kind of movie thats great stupid fun as long as someone else is buying the tickets. The genre might be summed up as Redneck Horror Faust or maybe NASCAR Goth. Johnny Blaze is a stunt cyclist who in his youth makes a deal with Mephistopheles himself to save his cancer-afflicted dad (Brett Cullen ).The devil comes in the guise of Fonda. Its quite eerie Fonda makes it through the entire movie without moving a single facial muscle. In the grand tradition Scratch doesnt play fair and we cut several years ahead to find Johnny played by Cage with crazy eyes a late-Elvis voice and a hairpiece the size of a small marsupial .Johnnys a famous Evel Knievel -style daredevil who thanks to the fine print on the contract cheats death on a daily basis. The devils evil son Blackheart wants to take control of the world and -- wait why am I even bothering? All you need to know is that every night Johnny goes flame-on and morphs into a leather-clad chain-wielding avenger with a Sterno skull and a hunka hunka burnin hog.Thankfully ""Ghost Rider"" plays a lot of this for comedy -- at least until the special effects budget kicks in -- and Cage lets himself go loosey-goosey in a way he hasnt since oh ""Vampires Kiss"" way back in 1989 . Johnny likes to listen to the Carpenters songs and eat jelly beans out of martini glasses neither of which I bet were in the script by writer-director Mark Steven Johnson. Johnson was responsible for ""Daredevil"" and the script for ""Electra."" This time he seems to be in on the joke.Eva Mendes is scrumptious as Johnnys love interest and Sam Elliott collects a nice paycheck as a Ghost Rider of an earlier generation. The elemental Nephilim  demons who hang out with Blackheart because hes the baddest kid in school are cool to look at but put up surprisingly little fight. The star doesnt make the same mistake. Asks Cages Johnny ""If somebody makes a mistake -- a big mistake -- do you think they should pay for it every day for the rest of their lives?"" The correct answer is Only until their next movie.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Ghost Rider So bad its good | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGhost Rider So bad its goodAs eternal damnation goes its a toss-up for Nicolas Cage Would he rather face the razzing until Doomsday hes going to endure for The Wicker Man remake or be Satans errand boy until hell freezes over?Nicolas Cage burns up the big screen as a flaming-chopper riding superhero in <i>Ghost Rider. </i>By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Feb. 16 2007 Starring Nicolas Cage Eva Mendes Peter Fonda Donal Logue Sam Elliott and Wes Bentley. Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson. 114 minutes. At major theatres. PGWould he rather face the razzing until Doomsday hes going to endure for dressing up in a bear costume to play a psycho cop in last years The Wicker Man remake (get that Razzie Award ready) or would he rather be Satans errand boy until hell freezes over?Im guessing he chooses door No. 2 as seen in his new film Ghost Rider. Its all comic book stuff. And besides his career couldnt possibly slide any deeper into the flames.At least with Ghost Rider which arrives in theatres today with only the most last-minute of previews Cage is doing something he loves for a change. Hes long been into motorbikes and he claims to have a fascination with Ghost Rider as being ""one of the most unique mythologies in the comic book universe."" Article Continued BelowHes in good company with writer/director Mark Steven Johnson a fellow comic geek who probably has a statue of Stan Lee in his garden. Johnson previously directed Daredevil another character from the Marvel Comics stable of misunderstood heroes.We can all agree that Ghost Rider is not your average comic book. The saga of a man forced into a Faustian deal to be the devils bounty hunter - why cant Satan catch his own bad guys? - began in the 1940s with a cowboy theme. Marvel revived it in the 1970s and again in the 1990s with its current supernatural biker spin. The movie cleverly connects the dots from then to now. Cowboy icon Sam Elliott plays the enigmatic Caretaker and only a guy like him could get away with lines like this ""Any man who got the guts to sell his soul for love has the power to change the world.""Props are due too to the casting of Easy Rider ace Peter Fonda as the devilish Mephistopheles who offers protection in exchange for dark services rendered and to Eva Mendes as the love interest a nice switch from the usual vanilla bombshell.As Johnny Blaze stunt rider extraordinaire by day and flaming skeleton bounty hunter by night Cage once again gets to play a guy who looks danger in the face and laughs.Too often in his recent films the audience has been laughing too for all the wrong reasons.So whats the skinny on the skeleton?Well it strays dangerously into camp territory its 20 minutes too long and the special effects are cheesier than Mickey Mouses lunch.Cages human character is weirder than his skeletal one. He chugs jelly beans out of a martini glass talks to himself in the mirror and listens to The Carpenters on his home stereoBut damned if this one shouldnt make your so-bad-its-good list - especially when Wes Bentley shows up as a bad Elvis impersonator from Hell whom Ghost Rider has to send to Heartbreak Hotel.Cage has finally found a movie where its okay to chew the scenery - or even to set it on fire.A Ghost Rider franchise beckons. And with the lovely Mendes by his side a romantic spin-off Beauty and the Briquette.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.
