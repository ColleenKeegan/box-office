PHOTOS 40 Tearjerkers Which is something of a shame. A lighter hand would have enhanced some very good performances -- and an unusually realistic depiction of terminal illness for Hollywood where dying all too often still resembles something straight out of ""Love Story."" Jeremy Leven who wrote Cassavetes far more effective weepie ""The Notebook"" is working here from a novel by Jodi Piccoult three of whose previous works were adapted for Lifetime. This ones intriguing premise is that 11-year-old Anna (Abigail Breslin) has been specifically conceived and genetically engineered as an organ donor for her teenage sister Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) who developed leukemia as a baby. The superb French movie ""A Christmas Tale"" mined this kind of setup for dark laughs. But ""My Sisters Keeper"" instead draws inspiration from a different sort of dark comedy ""Irreconcilable Differences"" (the one in which Drew Barrymore tried to ""divorce"" her self-absorbed parents). Anna hires a showboating lawyer (Alec Baldwin) known for his TV ads to sue for ""medical emancipation"" so her parents cant force her to donate a kidney for her sibling who is beloved but dying. The suit infuriates their mother Sara (Cameron Diaz) who has given up her law career to nurse Kate for 15 years and angrily calls Anna ""selfish."" More sympathetic are the girls long-suffering fireman father (Jason Patric) and their dyslexic brother (Evan Ellingson). They realize along with a sympathetic and always-available oncologist (David Thornton) that a kidney donation may only be painfully delaying the inevitable for Kate. The main story is frequently interrupted by a series of schmaltzy flashbacks -- beautifully photographed by Caleb Deschanel -- including Kates doomed romance with another teenage cancer patient (Thomas Dekker). Even the judge who finally decides the case (Joan Cusack) is saddled with a tear-jerking back-story. Baldwin is in fact the only principal actor who doesnt cry -- although he does suffer a medical crisis. The sad thing is all this overkill really wasnt necessary. It distracts from the performances which are fine across the board except for Diaz. Working well outside her comfort zone as an actress Diaz is fairly shrill and one-note until near the end of the movie. I teared up exactly once watching ""My Sisters Keeper."" It was during the understated deathbed scene which is utterly true to my own experiences in this area. lou.lumenicknypost.com MY SISTERS KEEPER Suds and tears. Running time 107 minutes.

Sidney Baldwin ""My Sisters Keeper"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Having a child with a serious disease can take its toll on an entire family even one as affluent adventurous and accomplished as the Fitzgeralds. Teenager Kate is in the late stages of leukemia and as her health declines it threatens to become a black hole that consumes them all. ""My Sisters Keeper"" an uneven but deeply moving adaptation of Jodi Picoults 2004 bestseller probes the emotional turmoil of a family whose lives are defined by preventing a daughters death. Sara (Cameron Diaz) abandoned her career as a lawyer to manage Kates care preparing organic meals researching treatments negotiating with oncologists and surgeons for the most advanced forms of care. Shes sharply intelligent and tenacious plotting strategies against her daughters cancer as if it were a courtroom adversary she could wear down or outwit. Shes exactly the advocate youd want if you were in peril bulldozing through all opposition but her laserlike concentration on Kates health pushes everyone else into the background. Her firefighter husband Brian (Jason Patric) is a stoic supportive afterthought. Their adolescent son Jesse (Evan Ellingson) is alienated and invisible; he takes nighttime bus rides into risky areas of town and no one notices hes gone. Its 11-year-old Anna (Abigail Bres- lin) who has paid the biggest price. She was artificially conceived as a source of spare parts a genetically engineered perfect donor for stem cells blood and bone marrow. As Kates condition worsens the family turns to Anna for a kidney transplant. Anna dearly loves her sister (hauntingly played by Minneapolis native Sofia Vassilieva) but she refuses to compromise her own health and files a lawsuit to win control over her own body. But the film doesnt succumb to courtroom claustrophobia. ""My Sisters Keeper"" is an insightful family drama not a bioethics lecture. Director and co-writer Nick Cassavetes treats this potentially soapy material with sensitivity and care understanding the evolution of families under stress. He casts actors against type (Diaz and Little Miss Precocious Breslin are especially effective in weighty roles). He honors each characters perspective on the difficult choices they face. Saras insistence that Kate must be drugged radiated and cut open as often as it takes to beat her cancer gets his respect. So does Kates desire to experience life outside the intensive-care ward even if it has unhealthy consequences. Annas desire for medical emancipation from her parents control contains a bit of willful selfishness but a surprising amount of mature wisdom. MY SISTERS KEEPER  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for mature thematic content some disturbing images sensuality language and brief teen drinking. Even secondary characters have intriguing personalities. Alec Baldwin is superb as Annas principled but self-promoting attorney and in a rare dramatic role Joan Cusack gets the humane essence of the judge hearing the case after losing her own child. The story is something of a collage overlapping scenes from present and past telling the story through a half-dozen narrators voices. Its as if the scrapbook that Kate keeps of her life has come alive onscreen an evocative and touching effect. The film omits some of the novels grittier themes and crucially offers a new ending replacing the shocking twist climax that many readers found melodramatic and contrived. ""My Sisters Keeper"" concludes on a redemptive lyrical note. This is a weepie with heart and brains to spare. Get out your handkerchiefs.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In ""My Sisters Keeper"" precocious Anna Fitzgerald walks into a lawyers office and asks that he represent her in a suit against her loving parents. They want her to donate a kidney to her older sister who is battling leukemia. The 9-year-old doesnt want to contribute any longer to her sis survival. Based on Jodi Picoults best-selling novel about a kid born to provide healthy cells bone marrow even an organ to her ailing sibling ""My Sisters Keeper"" humanizes vexing questions about medical ethics without sacrificing rattling family drama. Cameron Diaz and Jason Patric are Sara and Brian Fitzgerald in what is surely the most counterintuitive -- and welcome -- programming of the summer season. Abigail Breslin plays little Miss Heartbreak Anna. Alec Baldwin is attorney Campbell Alexander. Anna seeks him out because of his TV spots. The film is directed and co-written by Nick Cassavetes who made 2004s sleeper summer hit ""The Notebook."" That romantic melodrama of love and fading memory (also cowritten with Jeremy Leven)was undiluted sweet tea. Either you drank it up or gagged. This is something altogether different a powerfully intelligent weeper. The good -- and well-earned -- cry comes like a shower after weeks of projects that have delivered little release. Diaz once again surprises with just how good she can be. She carries the burden of unlikability with a kind of fury and determination. A couple of years ago PBS aired a shattering documentary about children with cancer and their parents. Called ""A Lion in the House"" the title clearly referred to the predator sitting in wait for a childs life. Yet Diazs performance reminds us just how ferocious a parent can become when a child falls ill. The impossible rub is that engaged in the fight of her life Sara loses sight of her husband and her other children -- Anna and middle child Jesse (Evan Ellingson). A lioness in the house can be a danger too. Diaz isnt alone in giving teeth to this movie. Multiple voice-overs from Brian and the three children underscore how a family disaster is both shared and deeply personal. As easy as it is to second-guess Sara ""My Sisters Keeper"" is not a blame-Mom tale. This isnt a dysfunctional family. This is a high-functioning one suffering under years of duress and hope duress and despair. Everyone is affected. Everyone is robbed of the way their lives might have gone had Kate never been sick. Sofia Vassilieva has the hardest job she plays Kate. In a radical departure from the prettified illnesses of yore Kates nose bleeds her lips crack she throws up. And yes she even rages on occasion. Like the scrapbook Kate keeps hidden ""My Sisters Keeper"" is full of images and moments that stand out. When Kate comes down the stairs dressed for a hospital ""prom"" its a paparazzi moment. Camera flashes and enthusiastic demands for poses play against her fathers silence which Patric depicts beautifully. Moments earlier Brian looked at Kates suitor with a tight-lipped gaze as tender as it is suspicious. Thomas Dekker is sweetness and warm light as fellow cancer patient and first love Taylor. Baldwin is especially fine as an ambulance-chaser who isnt one. Joan Cusack has seldom been better. The often comedic actor plays family court Judge De Salvo straight and wounded. That the judge has lost her own child might seem too coincidental. Instead the fact is integral to the storys insights. Loss and vulnerability are all around us. Theres no shame in that just heartbreak. And when were lucky loved and loving some manner of recovery. ""MY SISTERS KEEPER"" PG-13 for mature thematic content some disturbing images sensuality language and brief teen drinking. 1 hour 49 minutes.

My Sisters Keeper Cancer tale requires a stack of hankies | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMy Sisters Keeper Cancer tale requires a stack of hankiesThe Fitzgeralds are a family on the edge.Cameron Diaz is a mother devoted to her dying child played by Sofia Vassilieva in My Sisters Keeper.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterFri. June 26 2009 Starring Cameron Diaz Abigail Breslin and Sofia Vassilieva. Directed by Nick Cassavetes. 109 minutes. At the Cumberland. PG The Fitzgeralds are a family on the edge.From the day older sister Kate was born her parents have struggled to keep her alive. Mom has given up her law practice to provide full-time care for her daughter who has leukemia and youngest daughter Anna has been brought into the world for the purpose of providing a genetically compatible and ready supply of life-saving stem cells and bone marrow for her sister.But the family has come to a crossroads.Article Continued BelowKate will die without a kidney transplant but at 11 Anna (played by Abigail Breslin) balks at the idea of providing one of her own citing the impact it would have on her own future. Despite her intense love for her sister Anna hires a lawyer to seek medical emancipation from her parents.But Mom (played by Cameron Diaz) is like a grizzly bear protecting her cub. Nothing will stand in her way including her younger daughters inexplicable intransigence.My Sisters Keeper doesnt just tug it tears at the heartstrings. Its a roller coaster of love and pain and bravery and desperation.While many films would temper the emotional peaks and valleys along the way in preparation for a wrenching finale this film has a multitude of heart-rending arcs throughout.Dont try to be brave. Unless youre made of stone youre not going to make it to the end without shedding a few tears.Director Nick Cassavetes has assembled a strong cast particularly the younger members. Sofia Vassilieva is luminously affecting as Kate portraying her physical decline with stunning precision and honesty. Thomas Dekker playing a fellow cancer patient is winningly charismatic as her doomed love interest.Breslin plays Anna as a child on the edge of burgeoning adolescence whos hiding a secret one whose revelation will change everything.Breslins portrayal of Annas pained defiance and stoicism in the face of her mothers onslaught is understated to near perfection.Even Evan Ellingson as the often-neglected older brother has numerous pathos-filled moments.Diaz best known for lighter roles doesnt shy away from playing a driven mother who becomes less sympathetic as the drama progresses.Jason Patric is also fine in the role of the conflicted father who smoulders in the background in deference to his wifes wishes until he finally takes a more defiant stance. The always-reliable Joan Cusack as a family court judge dealing with the recent death of her own child is truly exceptional and Alec Baldwin turns in a nicely measured performance as the attorney Anna hires.Cassavetes uses flashbacks minimally to flesh out the familys past and creatively uses montage art at several points to give the audience a bit of an emotional respite and to help nudge the narrative along.As wrenching as this film is there is nary a false moment of contrivance or emotional manipulation.Rather with solid performances and an intelligent script My Sisters Keeper offers a moving and powerfully realistic portrait of a family stalked by tragedy that somehow manages to emerge from crisis battered but intact.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The documentary film was written and directed by Clay Tweel. Photo Open Road Films By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 30 2016 155 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS The subject of Clay Tweels superb documentary feature is Steve Gleason the former New Orleans Saints safety who was diagnosed with ALS or Lou Gehrigs disease in 2011. Shortly afterward Mr. Gleason started chronicling the progress of his disease in a video diary but six weeks later he and his wife Michel learned she was pregnant. At that point the diary became for the most part a series of straight-to-the-camera messages to his son Rivers both before and after the birth. ""My intention"" he says at the outset when his speech is still unimpaired ""is to pass on as much of who I am as I possibly can to you."" What was meant as a gift to his son is a gift to anyone who watches the film which incorporates Mr. Gleasons home videos in a profile of almost unfathomable courage--hes still very much with us although his body has been ravaged by the disease--and a portrait of a profoundly good man. ENLARGE Michel Gleason Steve Gleason and Rivers Gleason. Photo Open Road Films ""Gleason"" is so powerful in its cumulative effect that it should be accompanied by a consumer advisory--something along the lines of ""This documentary may cause sudden alterations of mood and attitude."" I can attest to having been undone by at least one scene and Im far from an easy weeper; its a confrontation between Mr. Gleason and his own father a man with rigid notions of good and evil. The moment is at once heart-rending and transcendently beautiful and father-and-son themes play in parallel throughout the film or perhaps they intertwine in a double helix. Mr. Gleason is determined to be a better father for his son than his father was for him even though he must speak through a voice synthesizer by the time Rivers is starting to talk. More Reviews Jason Bourne Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films The film is authentically inspiring but also unsparing in its depiction of the horrors of ALS and its impact on the family. (The implacable strength of Michel Gleason could be the subject of a separate film.) The disease moves swiftly attacking Steve Gleasons spirit as well as his body. There are times captured by the unblinking camera when his agonies seem unendurable yet he has rejected assisted suicide and chosen to live out a life that brings joy with the pain. In one conjunction of more emotions than can be put into words we see him struggling to breathe while he watches Rivers struggling to blow out all four candles on his birthday cake. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download The Theory of Everything (2014) Eddie Redmayne stars brilliantly as the cosmologist Stephen Hawking who at age 21 was diagnosed with a motor neuron disorder related to Lou Gehrigs disease and given two years to live. More than half a century later hes still going strong.

Pictures All for her After Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) is diagnosed with leukemia her parents have a second daughter who can donate bone marrow. ABOUT THE MOVIEMy Sisters Keeper  (out of four)Stars Abigail Breslin Sofia Vassilieva Cameron Diaz Alec Baldwin Joan Cusack Jason PatricDirector Nick CassavetesDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13 for mature thematic content some disturbing images sexuality language and brief teen drinkingRunning time 1 hour 46 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY My Sisters Keeper takes a compelling ethical dilemma and turns it into formulaic pap by trying relentlessly to ensure an emotional reaction with sentimental exploitation and plot contrivances. Maybe if the film had adhered more closely to Jodi Picoults best-selling novel the result would have been better. Abigail Breslin and Sofia Vassilieva are terrific. But the performances by the older actors are largely forgettable. Sara (Cameron Diaz) and Brian (Jason Patric) are leading happy comfortable lives as the parents of son Jesse (Evan Ellingson) and daughter Kate (Vassilieva). When Kate is diagnosed with leukemia they decide to have a third child Anna (Abigail Breslin) whose bone marrow can be harvested to help Kate. At 11 Anna rebels and seeks to become medically emancipated from her parents to avoid the painful treatments that could prolong Kates life. Enter Campbell Alexander (Alec Baldwin) a personable lawyer with questionable motives. He and Anna embark on an unusual court case that threatens to tear the family apart. All the ingredients are here for an absorbing and touching film. Instead what ends up on screen is a formulaic and banal Lifetime-style movie with music videos thrown in to enhance the heartbreak. Director Nick Cassavetes indulges in overkill resorting repeatedly to an emotional song and weepy montages designed to wring poignancy from an already tragic tale. These artificial moments are in sharp contrast with the natural performances of Breslin and Vassilieva. But plot holes and inconsistencies dilute the storys potency. My Sisters Keeper doesnt scratch beyond the surface of the complex moral question it poses. Rather than exploring the tyranny of hope or stubborn determination vs. realism My Sisters Keeper simply traffics in mawkish sentimentality.

Video by New Line Cinema>> LAUNCH VIDEO PLAYER Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 26 2009 ""My Sisters Keeper"" the much-anticipated adaptation of the novel by cult favorite Jodi Picoult has to do with emancipation a theme that the movie itself unwittingly plays into. At least two perfectly good movies fight to break free within this busy oddly shaped weepie one a peppery provocative legal thriller the other a mother-daughter melodrama worthy of Joan Crawford and Lana Turner at their most Gothically self-sacrificing. This StoryMy Sisters Keeper Just Cant Keep Its Weepy Stories StraightPicoults Appeal Is Weeping The NationDiscuss Do You Buy Cameron in Keeper?My Sisters KeeperFind Showtimes Buy TicketsSummer Movie GuideView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story If director Nick Cassavetes had decided to make just one of those films ""My Sisters Keeper"" would have provided a nifty piece of early summer counterprogramming to the bigger-louder-dumber fare on offer on most screens. Then again he most likely would have been pilloried by Picoults fans who gobble up books whose trademarks are complicated ensembles of character-narrators convoluted plots meticulously staged coincidences and lurid visions of parental agony. In that regard Cassavetes -- best known for the 2004 hit romantic drama ""The Notebook"" -- can be thanked for reining in the most outlandish aspects of ""My Sisters Keeper."" Hes succeeded in creating an adaptation that while departing dramatically from such key elements as the books ending will no doubt please fans in need of a good cry no matter how manipulatively the tears have been jerked. If ""My Sisters Keeper"" has a central character it would be Anna (Abigail Breslin) an 11-year-old girl who was conceived by her parents Sara and Brian (Cameron Diaz and Jason Patric) in order to harvest umbilical cord blood bone marrow and various organs for their daughter Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) who suffers from acute promyelocytic leukemia. As ""My Sisters Keeper"" opens Anna marches into the office of an aggressive Los Angeles attorney named Campbell Alexander (Alec Baldwin) demanding to be ""medically emancipated"" from her parents. Kate is in renal failure and Anna doesnt want to donate the kidney she was specifically bred to give up. Its a thorny ethical debate rife with dramatic potential and as long as ""My Sisters Keeper"" stays with this fascinating disquieting issue and its effect on the family the movie toggles smoothly between intellectual arguments and rank emotionalism. This is after all a movie whose early scenes include a young girl being held down for a spinal tap and later coughing up blood with the grim heroics of Camille. Annas encounters with Alexander and later with a judge played with twitchy sharpness by Joan Cusack keep mawkishness gratifyingly at bay. (Par for Picoults course even these supporting characters come with their own plot twists that could have been engineered in the same petri dish as Anna.) But just when ""My Sisters Keeper"" looks like it might be an absorbing unusually prickly break from sentimental tradition the action shifts from Annas story to Kates when she meets a fellow patient (Thomas Dekker) and falls in love. Its an undeniably affecting sequence given added appeal by a terrific performance by Dekker but it represents one of several tonal shifts that make ""My Sisters Keeper"" an ever-widening shaggy dog story (come to think of it it even features a shaggy dog). Awkward too is Cassavetess reliance on music cues to sell the movies swirling emotions. After countless montages of people blowing bubbles on trampolines or gamboling attractively on the beach one longs to remind the filmmakers that a series of scenes set to wistful pop songs does not a movie make. For their part Breslin and Vassilieva acquit themselves beautifully in emotionally and in Vassilievas case physically demanding roles. Evan Ellingson as their largely ignored big brother Jesse makes the most of an otherwise marginal character. Patric playing the worlds richest firefighter seems to float passively throughout the proceedings although thats probably appropriate for a character who cant bring himself to tell his cancer-riddled daughter that yes she is pretty. Even though ""My Sisters Keeper"" is nominally Annas story the real center of the action is Sara played by Diaz with a spiky careworn absence of vanity. Diaz has made dramatic bids before in ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her."" But perhaps a moment of silence is in order to recognize the fact that one of Hollywoods most delectable pop tarts is now playing the mother of teenagers (meaning I must be 100 years old). So passes the glory of the world -- yet another theme of one of the many movies vying for pride of place in ""My Sisters Keeper."" My Sisters Keeper (109 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for mature thematic content some disturbing images sensuality profanity and brief teen drinking. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  My Sisters Keeper Just Cant Keep Its Weepy Stories Straight Picoults Appeal Is Weeping The Nation Find Showtimes Buy Tickets Summer Movie Guide My Sisters Keeper Discuss Do You Buy Cameron in Keeper?",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/25/AR2009062504142.html,200,mysister'skeeper10,mysister'skeeper,washingtonpost

But still . . .)The story of 11-year-old Anna Fitzgerald (Abigail Breslin) and of the whole Fitzgerald family My Sisters Keeper begins with Annas voice-over explaining ""I was engineered with a specific reason . . . to save my sisters life."" True enough Her parents Sara and Brian (Cameron Diaz and Jason Patric) a lawyer and a fireman have another daughter Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) stricken with leukemia.A compatible donor is needed - for blood infusions bone marrow organ transplants - and so on the advice of their doctor the couple conceives a child in a Petri dish using sperm egg and the latest in biogenetic technology. From the time she was an infant Anna has functioned as a spare-parts resource for her sis.And shes had enough.Thats where My Sisters Keeper starts with the Little Miss Sunshine tween recruiting a slick lawyer (Alec Baldwin) to petition the court to grant her ""medical emancipation"" from her parents. Anna wants control of her own body. She doesnt want the giant needles plunged into her hips to suck out the marrow. She doesnt want the horrifying hospital visits. She wants to keep her kidneys for herself.Selfish? Maybe.With a screenplay by Cassavetes and his Notebook collaborator Jeremy Leven My Sisters Keeper is the sort of enterprise that anyone whos had a brush with cancer is going to have a hard time sitting through without reflexively tearing up and even blubbering.The scenes of adolescent Kate puking blood undergoing chemo treatments experiencing depression shame guilt and self-loathing along with the crushing physical hurt - theyre tough to behold even if cinematographer Caleb Deschanel lights and shoots them like hes making a Hallmark movie.Diaz - as a mom whos forsaken her legal career to take a defiant stand against death doing everything she can to prolong her daughters life - is ""brave"" in that actorly kind of way. Theres a scene in which Sara shaves her head in support of her bald daughter. Diaz didnt actually shave her head but she does do many of her scenes without makeup.And Diaz gets her own voice-over monologue as does Patric - the different points of view functioning like stanza refrains born in shared familial anguish.For those who havent read Picoults book My Sisters Keeper offers a couple of twists one of them crucial and the other cruelly unnecessary and melodramatic. Actually the crucial twist is steeped in weepy melodrama too right down to the bone.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) is ravaged by sickness bald vomiting and bleeding after being diagnosed with leukemia. My Sisters Keeper 1 / 3 Back to Gallery My Sisters Keeper has a gutsy premise but no guts. At its center is an ethical dilemma. An 11-year-old girl goes to a lawyer to sue her parents for medical emancipation. All her life she has been used for spare parts. She was conceived in a test tube as a genetic match for a sister who suffers from leukemia. As a result this younger sister has been stuck with needles undergone bone marrow extractions and endured infections and hospital stays virtually since infancy. Now her sister needs a kidney and her parents are insisting that she give her one. They say she has no choice. But young Anna (Abigail Breslin) says forget it enough is enough. She knows that if she doesnt consent her sister Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) will die -- very soon. But Anna is done. She gave at the office. She refuses to be cut open and thats it. Thus begins My Sisters Keeper and if that sounds like the making of a compelling drama it should -- but director and co-writer Nick Cassavetes didnt make one. Following these arresting opening minutes the film turns soft where it needs to be hard morally easily where it needs to be difficult and simple where it needs to be complicated. It even loses its honesty except in one area and for that it deserves credit It does not pull its punches when it comes to depicting illness. We see Kate as a little girl and as an ostensibly healthy 15-year-old. And then we see her ravaged by sickness bald vomiting and bleeding with chapped lips pale gums and blue translucent skin. No one with any empathy or human sympathy could see such a spectacle with indifference. But does watching that -- and feeling sad that such awful things can happen -- constitute a full and satisfying cinematic experience? Pressing buttons is easy. The challenge of making My Sisters Keeper was to give viewers a reason to sit there and get their buttons pressed. There the film fails to deliver. Most of My Sisters Keeper is told in flashback. Cameron Diaz is the Mom a lawyer who put her career on hold to devote herself to keeping her daughter alive. Diaz plays the role in a single key -- fierce -- but the note is a welcome change for this actress. Jason Patrics turn as the decent-guy father is heartfelt though somewhat lost in the crossfire between Diazs histrionics and Alec Baldwins Shatner-like confidence as Annas hotshot lawyer. By midway My Sisters Keeper is just marking time. Theres a third sibling an older brother (Evan Ellingson) whose main function in the movie is to trigger musical interludes. Every time hes on screen a different morose folk ballad is heard on the soundtrack. Thats not supposed to be funny but it is. At its worst things gets to the point that if a character just stares off vacantly you know thats good for a 10-minute digression. Meanwhile the script dodges the essential question If Anna were to give Kate her kidney would it save her life -- or would Kate just die a few months later? For a movie supposedly exploring an ethical dilemma this is an epic omission. This is information that the audience absolutely needs in order to figure out how it feels. Only later do we realize that My Sisters Keeper has perpetrated a bait-and-switch. It has no interest in medical morality and ethics. That element was introduced at the beginning simply to grab our attention. The movie is really about how awful it is that Kate is sick. And you know what? It is awful truly horribly painfully awful. But so is the movie. Still one thing to pull from the rubble Joan Cusacks performance as the judge a woman who has recently lost her own child. Her emotions are raw but shes also a professional with a job to do. Twenty years ago Cusacks face was that of a light zany comedienne. Now hers is one of intelligence and humanity. My Sisters Keeper doesnt deserve her. mlasallesfchronicle.com Todays Deals 4-Panel Abstract Wall Art by Jon Allen for 145 + free shipping Defiant LED Flashlight 3-Pack for 10 + pickup at Home Depot Tamrac 28"" ZipShot Mini Compact Camera Tripod for 10 + free...

But because we live in a post-St. Elsewhere world of plot-enhancing ethical complications this particular luxuriously sad story based on a best-selling novel by skilled tear-wrencher Jodi Picoult isnt content with the simple challenges of life-threatening illness. While the sick teen girl Kate (Mediums Sofia Vassilieva) is a beaming beacon of bald-headed grace the spotlight belongs to her younger sister Anna (Abigail Breslin). Anna was genetically engineered and conceived by her parents (Cameron Diaz and Jason Patric) to supply spare parts to her ailing older sibling. And now Anna wants to sue for medical emancipation because she says shes tired of being a human pin cushion. Alec Baldwin adapts his sitcommy 30 Rock persona only slightly to play her showboating lawyer. Picoults fans are treated to a fair dose of the authors page-turning stuff including a subplot about Kates chaste cancer-ward romance. The extra cinematic shine meanwhile is the specialty of director Nick Cassavetes and screenwriter Jeremy Leven who painted and plastered over literary mush in The Notebook. Their message in My Sisters Keeper? Cancer sucks but theres always the balm of beach scenes and an emo soundtrack.

"My Sisters Keeper | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; my-sister-s-keeper ) My Sisters Keeper (United States 2009) June 26 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Death is as natural a part of life as is birth; every existence ends in the former as it begins in the latter. Human beings however have a natural aversion to addressing death in an open and honest manner. Its as unsuitable for polite conversation as sex and drugs. Movies too often veer into unbearable melodrama when the subject matter encroaches upon the Grim Reapers territory. Call it the Terms of Endearment syndrome - heap on the manipulation until the audience is drowning in tears. It is refreshing therefore to find a film that chronicles the process of accepting death without wallowing in sentimentality. With My Sisters Keeper director Nick Cassavetes exhibits a degree of restraint that is laudable. The film retains an emotional impact while maintaining a low-key style. It pushes buttons but not to the point of overkill. It is in short a rich experience that leaves the viewer in a contemplative mood without feeling used by a director eager to boost Kleenex sales. I have not read the best-selling novel by Jodi Picoult upon which the screenplay co-credited to Cassavetes and Jeremy Leven is based. Judging by the films structure which employs flashbacks a wrap-around voiceover and various internal monologues throughout it must have been difficult to get ""just right."" Credit goes to the director and the writers who have crafted a screen story that captures the essence of the characters and presents the themes and ideas in a clear coherent fashion. The actors also deserve a lions share of the kudos. Theres not a weak performance to be found. The films ""hook"" is a stunning declaration by 11-year old Anna Fitzgerald (Abigail Breslin) she does not want to donate a kidney to her older sister Kate (Sofia Vassileva) who is dying of lymphoma and shes willing to go to court to validate that decision. Anna was conceived as a ""donor baby"" - genetically compatible in all ways with Kate so that she could donate blood bone marrow and organs to her sister to prolong her life. By age 11 Anna has been poked and prodded with needles and has had bone marrow extracted twice. The prospect of giving her kidney to Kate is terrifying since the operation is not without danger and it could rob Anna of the capacity to live a ""normal"" life. So standing up to her mother Sara (Cameron Diaz) she decides she wants ""medical emancipation"" and approaches a lawyer Campbell Alexander (Alec Baldwin) to take her case. She still wants to live with her family and still loves her sister but she wants control of her body. Her brother Jesse (Evan Ellingson); father Brian (Jason Patric); and Kate understand and support her but Sara is angry and hurt. As the story unfolds we learn bits and pieces about the various characters and are provided with windows of insight into how Kates illness has impacted them. (One curious omission probably as a result of time constraints Saras faithful sister Kelly (Heather Wahlquist) is never properly developed. We never understand what inspires such a selfless devotion to her niece.) Flashbacks tell the story of how Kates lymphoma was diagnosed and what prompted Sara and Brian to bring Anna into the world; how hairline fissures within the family dynamic became more pronounced because of the potential tragedy in their midst; and how Kate found a way to steal some happiness with Taylor (Thomas Dekker) another cancer patient. The inevitable denouement of My Sisters Keeper is presented in a gentle dignified manner so unlike the overwrought climax of Terms of Endearment. The movie raises but does not dwell upon the thorny ethical issue of the rights accorded to a genetically engineered child. This is not after all science fiction. As the story progresses the question of whether Anna is eligible for ""medical emancipation"" becomes increasingly less important. The focus is upon each character accepting the inevitable where Kate is concerned with Sara who has fought the longest and hardest of them all for her daughter being the last holdout. Her blind devotion to a cause and her losing sight of the person at the heart of that cause makes her at times seem like a monster. Cassavetes however is mindful of not demonizing Sara being careful to balance her seeming cruelty with scenes providing insight into her pain and compassion. Love often compels irrational and occasionally ungenerous behavior. The performances are strong across-the-board. Cameron Diaz best known for appearing in romantic comedies and lighthearted fare shows dramatic chops in taking on a role that requires range and depth. Jason Patrics minimalist approach is perfect for Brian who is caught in the middle of the tug-of-war between his wife and daughter. Abigail Breslin and Sofia Vassileva display a natural bond one might expect from sisters and theres no hint of artifice or overacting in either performance. Alec Baldwin tones down his tendency toward bombast and delivers a finely tuned portrayal of a lawyer who has a hidden reason to pursue the case with tenacity. Perhaps the most memorable sample of acting comes from Joan Cusack who provides a heartbreaking interpretation of a bereaved judge. The pain in her eyes which occasionally pool with tears cannot fail to move. If theres an Oscar nomination lurking in this film it should go to Cusack. The strength of the acting and the modulation of the screenplay transforms what could have been a run-of-the-mill Lifetime disease-of-the-week movie into something more insightful and intelligent. Ultimately it is sad but there are moments of joy and enlightenment along the way. My Sisters Keeper does not cheat with a happy ending but perhaps more importantly neither does it cheat with something mawkish. By threading that needle it finds the right mix between emotionality and acumen a recipe followed by surprisingly too few dramas these days.

""My Sisters Keeper"" movie review -- Its a current article of faith in Hollywood that people are too depressed these days to want to see serious films. Thats why ""Mall Cop"" makes a bundle while ""State of Play"" disappears quickly. This is what makes ""My Sisters Keeper"" - a story about a child conceived solely as a medical donor for her sick sister who later sues her parents for ""medical emancipation"" - a particularly tough sell. My Sisters Keeper (PG-13) Warner Bros. (106 min.) Directed by Nick Cassavetes. With Cameron Diaz Abigail Breslin Alec Baldwin. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS REVIEW TWO STARS Rating note The film contains strong language sexual situations and underage drinking. In its favor it is based on a best-seller. It also has Cameron Diaz lending some star power in a rare dramatic role. But heres whats going to be its real problem and it has nothing to do with people not wanting to see a film about a child with leukemia Its not very good. From the start the movie is on slightly shaky ground; just the idea of spunky Abigail Breslin hiring strutting attorney Alec Baldwin sounds made for bad comedy - like Drew Barrymore trying to divorce her parents in ""Irreconcilable Differences."" What the Jodi Picoult book had going for it really was the character of the mother - and all the ""what-would-you-do?"" questions she raised. If you had a sick child would you have another kid solely in the hope of harvesting her bone marrow? It drove more than one book-group debate. But this isnt a book group its a movie. And one that quickly loses its focus. Blame director Nick Cassavetes who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jeremy Leven. The two last worked together on ""The Notebook"" but unfortunately what once seemed only sentimental has gotten so schmaltzy you could spread it on rye bread. Or is there someone else you can blame for the dreadful soundtrack choices which stagger from one inappropriate pop song (""Tiny Bubbles""? Really?) to another (""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" - sung as a dirge.) Who else might be responsible for a screenplay so sketchy that I spent most of it convinced that the sick girls brother was some kind of gay hustler? (Actually he just - wanders the streets a lot.) Or the casting which pairs Thomas Dekker (who is 22 and looks it) with Sofia Vassilieva (who is 17 and looks much younger) and so gives their chemo-ward romance an unintentionally creepy feel. Dont blame Diaz who commits to playing the brittle controlling mother. Or Vassilieva whos solid as the slowly failing leukemia girl. Or Abigail Breslin unsinkable as ever as the kid sister. All three are fine - and its a pleasure to see an uncured ham like Baldwin getting a few nice courtroom scenes to play. (When the judge warns him against showboating and he apologizes ""Sorry force of habit"" you wonder how often hes heard that on sets too.) But the film surrounds them with so much greeting-card sentiment and hackneyed TV soap style that anything real the actors do achieve soon disappears. In fact theres nothing very real here. The family of five lives on husband Jason Patrics firefighters salary? And they can afford a big house in Los Angeles along with more than a dozen years of in vitro treatments and hospital bills? Where are the scenes of Diaz selling those pretty diamond rings she wears in order to make the mortgage? Or of spending all day on the phone with their HMO trying to get them to cover a necessary operation? Wheres anything that feels like real life? So do your part for good movies -- dont avoid ""My Sisters Keeper"" because its a film about a serious issue. Avoid it because it approaches that issue like a very special episode of ""Greys Anatomy"" - complete with whining pop songs and all the comforts of cliche.

Abigail Breslin as Anna and Sofia Vassileva as Kate star in the overwrought drama based on Jodi Picoults best-selling novel. Joe Neumaier Thursday June 25 2009 303 PM Title My Sisters Keeper A girl doesnt want to be a donor sibling for her cancer-stricken sister. With Cameron Diaz Abigail Breslin Alec Baldwin. Director Nick Cassavetes (146). PG-13 Hospital drama language. At area theaters.There is a certain kind of drama--deceptively earnest aggressively well-meaning--that is in truth exploitation in disguise. ""My Sisters Keeper"" is this kind of movie a shameless attempt at manipulation that wants but doesnt earn audience tears. Lost amidst the calculated revelations and unpleasant obsessions with vulnerability are the performances of Alec Baldwin as a brusque-but-humane lawyer; Jason Patric as a stoic proud dad and Sofia Vassilieva as a teenager dying of leukemia. These three inhabit a more emotionally honest world than the emotionally invasive one director Nick Cassavetes and screenwriter Jeremy Leven (who previously teamed on ""The Notebook"") have fashioned from Jodi Picoults best-selling novel.Vassilieva plays Kate who at 14 has been living with a rare cancer for more than a decade. Her mother Sara (Cameron Diaz) has given up a law practice to care for her full-time although Kates firefighter father Brian (Patric) sees his wifes all-consuming drive toalleviate Kates pain as damaging to the rest of the family.That includes older brother Jesse (Evan Ellingson) who suffers from dyslexia and the movie vaguely suggests hustles in dodgy parts of Los Angeles and 11-year-old Anna (Abigail Breslin) who was conceived to be a ""donor sibling"" providing bone marrow and blood to Kate since birth.Anna however decides to deny her sister one of her kidneys and hires a lawyer (Baldwin) for her ""medical emancipation.""Cassavetes and Leven take Picoults already soap opera-ish story--filled with people scarred from trauma--and fill it with every cliche this genre allows from dewy musical interludes to emergency unpleasantness to young love cheated by death (one major change though may surprise fans of the novel).It all essentially buries Diaz. The actress is most interesting when shes intense but here she must contend with Sara being both a selfish control freak and a self-sacrificing mother lion. The movie wants her both ways and Diaz cant pull it off.Breslin (""Little Miss Sunshine"") acts saintly and not at all real while Joan Cusack in an uncomfortably odd cameo twitches and blinks as a judge with her own private tragedy.Patric and Baldwin react to all the morbidity with restraint and Vassilieva keeps her bald head high.But they wont be able to help this barefaced vulgarity earn any terms of endearment. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

My Sisters Keeper Add to ... James Adams From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 25 2009 253PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English My Sisters Keeper Directed by Nick Cassavetes Written by Jeremy Leven and Nick Cassavetes Starring Cameron Diaz Abigail Breslin Alec Baldwin Classification PG Im no stranger to tears at the movies. Over the years films as good bad and/or ugly as Old Yeller The Way We Were Terms of Endearment The Diving Bell and the Butterfly and The Hours have given the ole ducts a good workout. I was expecting to add My Sisters Keeper to the pantheon. It seems to have all the ingredients of a Kleenex classic a teenage girl suffering from renal failure as well as leukemia; a younger healthy sister who conceived as a sort of genetic spare-parts supplier decides at 11 she no longer wants to be the donor child; a lawyer who agrees to support the sister (Abigail Breslin of Little Miss Sunshine ) in her quest for ""medical emancipation""; a stressed-out Type-A mother whos determined not to see that happen. ... Alas My Sisters Keeper only engenders a case of duct lock. Loosely based on the best-selling 2004 novel of the same name by Jodi Picoult the film contains simply too much misery for its modest 109 minutes. Less an exercise in catharsis than an obstacle course of premise-heavy flashback-drenched plot points its an emotional flat-liner even though virtually every character (including Alec Baldwin as the lawyer) carries some hurt or grief. Unfortunately director Nick Cassavetes ( The Notebook ) handles these tragedies too perfunctorily with little sense of hierarchy or rhythm leaving the audience confused and unmoved. Cassavetess idea of yoking the emotions is to cue up the soundtrack and pile on the voiceovers. As manipulative devices these might have worked if the screenplay they were meant to enhance (by Cassavetes and Notebook collaborator Jeremy Leven) had a narrower focus with enriched back stories and real characters. But this is a film that thinks it doesnt have to earn its tears. Yes theres some good acting here - Cameron Diaz as Sara Fitzgerald the mom who refuses to give up; Sofia Vassilieva playing Kate the long-suffering alabaster-headed daughter (Im betting she gets an Oscar nod because Hollywood loves exemplary sufferers especially if theyre kids); and Billy Corgan look-a-like Thomas Dekker Kates cancer-ridden beau. But virtually all the characters are little better than ciphers vessels of mayhem and thematic rhetoric. Since nobody really breaks through no one in the audience is going to really break down. ""I dont mind the disease killing me"" emotes Kate in a voiceover at one point. ""But its killing my family too."" Whodda thunk it? Let it be said that fans of the Picoult novel are going to be upset with the adaptation. Some of Cassavetess changes are neither here nor there - Judge De Salvo is now a woman (played by Joan Cusack) the locale is California rather than Rhode Island - but the ending is radically revised and lacks the shock value of the original. Its a blessing in a way The novels conclusion is an unforgettable and unforgivable feat of deus-ex-machina hokum and cheap irony. By contrast the films wrap is considerably more plausible but its also anti-climactic and uninvolving. The denouement as well is a feel-good wimp-out. My Sisters Keeper is the first of Picoults 16 novels to be made into a feature film even though shes been a fixture on the bestseller lists for at least the last 10 years. Its a Hollywood truism that bad or mediocre novels can become good even great films. (Look at Love Story. Or not.) More often though bad begets bad. Which is the case here. Cassavetess adaptation likely will enjoy a solid opening weekend - Picoult addicts will see to that. But finally its more a cautionary tale about the dangers of what can happen when a bad movie happens to a popular novelist than a keeper for the ages.

(Sidney Baldwin/Warner Bros. via Ap) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / June 26 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The domestic afflictions in ""My Sisters Keeper pile onto the Fitzgerald family with biblical fury. Sixteen-year-old Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) has battled leukemia for most of her life. Eleven-year-old Anna (Abigail Breslin) has had it with being a ""donor child born to provide marrow and tissue for her sister and is suing for legal emancipation. Oldest son Jesse (Evan Ellingson) is dyslexic and doing something naughty downtown.A pall of disaster in fact hangs over everyone in this shapeless hankie-wringing adaptation of the best-selling Jodi Picoult novel. The judge in the case (Joan Cusack) is mourning a daughter dead in an accident and Annas lawyer (Alec Baldwin) keeps a service dog around for reasons that become clear late in the film. And theres the childrens mother Sara (Cameron Diaz) a monster of maternal denial so steely she could have been played by Joan Crawford in her fire-breathing prime.For all that devoted fans of Picoults books - hot-button family melodramas that never let up - may be most distressed by the violence done to the source. In bringing ""My Sisters Keeper to the screen co-writer/director Nick Cassavetes (""The Notebook) jettisons characters drops plotlines obscures a few motivations and completely changes the authors original ending. This book hasnt been adapted its been taken outside and shot.Thats not such a bad idea really. Picoult offered readers a hugely contrived final twist that multiplex audiences would probably have rejected en masse. What we get instead is weepy closure slightly more in keeping with the way life (or the movies) actually works. Yet ""My Sisters Keeper is still a well-intentioned mess peppered with strong performances and gripping moments but unable to get around the books lack of a strong central story line.Actually the novels spine is Kates cancer - every action and reaction radiates out from her disease. And ""My Sisters Keeper is very lucky to have the unknown Vassilieva in the role rooting the film in her characters quiet rebellious strength even as her body fails in horrible ways. This is a movie where the vomited blood looks real but the torrential emotions never stick.Cassavetes follows little Anna as the court case proceeds - Breslin (""Little Miss Sunshine) coasts on her natural warmth here which is fine - then hops to the struggle between Sara and her mellow-dude fireman husband Brian (Jason Patric) to define Kates final months then halfheartedly follows Jesse as he does not much of anything. In the process the films dramatic tension just dribbles away. The one section of ""My Sisters Keeper that feels right and true is Kates brief romance with a fellow cancer patient (Thomas Dekker very good) but even that is resolved in a frustratingly unresolved manner.Left on their own the actors bear down or drift away. Cusack twitches entertainingly; Baldwin asked to play a good and decent man has no idea how to proceed. Stepping further out onto the dramatic limb she explored in ""In Her Shoes Diaz at least gets her hooks into the dilemma that drives her character relentlessly forward A corporate lawyer on long-term leave Sara treats her daughters cancer as a case she cant afford to lose. The roles a rich piece of Bad Mom melodrama and a more daring actress might have taken it to operatic heights. Diaz either wont or cant quite get it there.The movie has excised the books Big Lulu toward the end but there is a more modest climactic twist. Unfortunately it has the effect of rendering everything weve seen up to now beside the point and ""My Sisters Keeper stands revealed for what it is disease-of-the-week exploitation with a few topical issues frosted on. If you respond - and there was plenty of discreet sobbing in the screening I attended - its only because Vassilieva makes you care for her character a believable teenage girl whose disease has only made her stronger. Shes a saint but shes one we can live with.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Adapted from a bestseller by Jodi Picoult that I hope to never read My Sisters Keeper starts with an intriguing premise. Cameron Diaz and Jason Patric conceive a child to keep her leukemic older sister (Sofia Vassilieva) alive through transfusions and transplants. But when Anna (Abigail Breslin) 11 hires a lawyer (Alec Baldwin) to sue for the right to her own body all hell breaks loose. So does the movie. Though the actors give it a go notably Diaz who plays the ""crazy bitch"" mom with no-bull restraint director Nick Cassavetes shifts to Notebook mode and jerks tears at every turn. Almost everyone Anna encounters has his or her own tragedy (cancer epilepsy a dead child). And each story is set to treacly songs (cue ""Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries"") that make the blood curdle.

But one thing is guaranteed The movie practically forces you to shed a tear or two. My Sisters Keeper Director Nick Cassavetes. Cast Abigail Breslin Cameron Diaz Jason Patric Alec Baldwin Sofia Vassilieva. Rating PG-13 for mature thematic content some disturbing images sensuality language and brief teen drinking. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Keeper hits close to home Spotlight Cameron Diaz Diaz gets star on Walk of Fame Director Nick Cassavetes doesnt believe in subtle manipulation either. Emotion is essentially forced out of viewers; theaters may as well hand out raw onions with the ticket stubs. The movie is based on an intriguing premise. Eleven-year-old Anna (Abigail Breslin from ""Little Miss Sunshine"") calls herself a ""designer baby"" early in the film. The reason She was conceived through genetic engineering to be a perfect match for older sister Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) who has leukemia. For her whole life Annas body has been plundered to keep her sibling alive. Now Kate needs a kidney transplant and Anna balks. She hires a hot-shot attorney (Alec Baldwin) and seeks medical emancipation. The lawsuit rocks the family. Overbearing mom Sara (Cameron Diaz) feels betrayed; dad Brian (Jason Patric) though torn is more levelheaded and open to Annas wishes. Cassavetes (""The Notebook"") sets up the film to be a courtroom drama but then the movie starts bouncing back and forth in time so we see the inner workings of the family. Unfortunately the transitions arent always smooth and some of the juxtapositions are a bit jarring. In keeping with the tradition of the book the story unfolds from the perspectives of different characters. Thats not particularly successful either. The sisters overshadow their brother Jesse in the family; hes overshadowed in the film too. He remains a cipher even when the action shifts to his point of view. The movie also seems to come to a halt whenever any random sappy vocal tune plays on the soundtrack. Combine that with the hazy sun-kissed cinematography and Cassavetes fondness for dreamy slow motion and several sequences end up looking like commercials for feminine-hygiene products. Despite the flaws the movie has some wrenching moments. The performances are mostly strong; Diaz in particular is quite effective as the brittle intensely focused mother. She makes the character more layered than she first appears. Less effective is Vassilieva but its not really the young actress fault. Instead she seems to have been directed to smile beatifically whenever possible as sunlight filters down around her face. Kate may look weary and vomit blood but she still faces the end just as realistically as Ali MacGraw did in ""Love Story"" all those years ago.

"Movie Review My Sisters Keeper -- 4 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie Review My Sisters Keeper -- 4 out of 5 stars My Sisters Keeper Cameron Diaz portrays the mother of a daughter with leukemia (Sofia Vassilieva) and the younger sister who was engineered to save her (Abigail Breslin). Cameron Diaz portrays the mother of a daughter with leukemia (Sofia Vassilieva) and the younger sister who was engineered to save her (Abigail Breslin). Roger MooreSentinel Staff Writer My Sisters Keeper is a horror movie for parents and a righteous weeper that earns its tears.Directed with a sure sensitive hand by Nick Cassavetes (The Notebook) it is an actors showcase built on a moral dilemma. But at its most basic its just a good cry. The Fitzgeralds are coping through good humor and positive attitude with a sick child. But we cant see the cost.Mom ( Cameron Diaz) is maniacally focused. Dad ( Jason Patric) is a loving breadwinner with a ready smile. But the leukemia that may kill Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) is sucking up all the attention. Brother Jesse (Evan Ellingson) is lost in the vortex of Kates illness. Anna 11 ( Abigail Breslin) has had enough. Shes the youngest the child who was ""engineered"" she narrates a kid they had who would provide the fetal cells and bone marrow that might give Kate a chance. She may love her sister but shes willing to hire a lawyer shes seen on TV ( Alec Baldwin) to sue to stop the procedures that dominate her life.My Sisters Keeper has many ways it could go wrong at this point. But Cassavetes working from a Jodi Picoult novel never makes a bad move. Sympathies shift as we see what every member of this barely functional family had to deal with for over a decade. The storys structure -- many of the characters narrate their points of view -- moves the film along and leaves room for great acting.Diaz gives one of the best performances of her career as the ""villain"" of the piece an uncompromising fighter. Baldwin is on the money as always but so is Breslin who has turned Little Miss Sunshine into a career of character turns that show she can hold her own with the best.Vassilieva anchors the film with a playful soulful presence. She makes Kate a real teenager who is keenly aware of what her illness is costing those she loves. Even the many montages set to mournful pop ballads never cross into maudlin. Cassavetes balances the ethical debate with teenage rites of passage the grim pallor of death with humor.Films that present a moral dilemma and make us consider the unthinkable are as rare as bargain popcorn in the summer. Cassavetes manages that feat and turns this weeper into a keeper.

When Kate relapses experiencing renal failure Anna (Abigail Breslin) defies her birthright duty to play donor and cough up a kidney. She contacts TV-spot lawyer Campbell Alexander (Alec Baldwin possibly the only actor who doesnt cry on-screen) who agrees to help her win medical emancipation. Before mom Sara (Cameron Diaz) quit work to scrutinize her daughters cell count she was a lawyer herself which sets the stage for a family catharsis in the courtroom. Screenwriter Jeremy Leven and director Nick Cassavetes who previously jackpotted with The Notebook reunite to adapt another heartstrings molester. From a 2004 Jodi Picoult bestseller My Sisters Keeper mashes Death Be Not Proud with Irreconcilable Differences. The film is extraordinarily explicit in showing the effects of disease and whats involved in caring for the sick. You dont usually see this unblinking attention to the progress of physical decay in a PG-13 wide-release movie and to the degree that it represents a real aspect of human experience generally curtained out of sight it is in the language of movie people a brave decision. But makeup department realism alone cant redeem the dramatic fallacies surrounding it.

Theres crying and vomiting aplenty in ""My Sisters Keeper"" and audiences may be forgiven the urge to respond in kind. Unsubtle uneven and undeniably effective this take-no-prisoners cancer weepie poses a fascinating moral quandary -- a girl fighting her parents for the right to control her body while her older sister wastes away from leukemia -- as a mere pretext for a full-scale assault on the viewers tear ducts. To the extent that many will deem the assault highly successful Warners ""Keeper"" could be a sleeper especially as a femme-friendly alternative to the latest ""Transformers."" Adapted from Jodi Picoults 2004 bestseller ""My Sisters Keeper"" is the saga of the long-suffering Fitzgerald family pivoting on a crucial moment in the lives of two sisters teenage Kate who was diagnosed with leukemia at an early age and has been in and out of hospitals ever since and 11-year-old Anna who was conceived in vitro as a perfect genetic match for Kate -- a living repository of blood bone marrow and other bodily resources. So when Anna marches into a lawyers office and announces her decision to sue for ""medical emancipation"" -- which would free her from her obligation to donate the kidney that could save Kates life -- their parents feel understandably shocked and betrayed. Their dad Brian (Jason Patric) takes the news better than mom Sara (Cameron Diaz) who is fiercely and overbearingly devoted to Kates welfare often to the neglect of her husband younger daughter and son Jesse (Evan Ellingson). Writer-director Nick Cassavetes and co-scribe Jeremy Leven retain Picoults technique of narrating the story from multiple points of view interwoven with flashbacks that trace Kates declining health and its impact on the family at every stage. While the device feels arch and clunky in its attempt to accommodate the perspectives of five characters giving short shrift to some (the script regards Jesse with scarcely more interest than Sara does) it does reinforce the idea of the family as a fragmented unit whose members find themselves at odds in matters of life and death. Cassavetes was arguably well prepped for this film having directed one crowdpleasing tearjerker (""The Notebook"") and grappled with medical ethics sort of in ""John Q."" Yet the lack of tonal discipline evident in his past work is also present here as the storys stew of family angst terminal-illness melodrama and courtroom theatrics produces a dangerously unstable mixture of moods. Early scenes bog down in shrill bickering (mostly courtesy of Diaz using Saras brittle edges as an excuse to crank up the volume) chased into temporary remission by upbeat moments of family bonding. Yet Cassavetes also is capable of a softer touch which he demonstrates in a poignant extended flashback to Kates romance with a dreamy fellow patient (Thomas Dekker). As lovely images of the past insistently tug our attention away from the present some of the dramas more pertinent questions -- what motivates Annas sudden self-interest? Whats it like to live with your parents when youre suing them? -- are casually glossed over. Too much scrutiny it turns out would spoil the climactic twist. Its that calculated sense of dramatic evasion that makes ""My Sisters Keeper"" feel all too convenient as it short-circuits its own philosophical/scientific provocation and instead goes for the viewers jugular. To that end Cassavetes falls back on a reliable combo of heart-tugging music (either mood-setting pop tunes or Aaron Zigmans tastefully downbeat score) and repeated shots of a bald feeble Kate beaming angelically through her tears. In the face of such an impeccably mounted emotional onslaught what argument can there be? That the film does come by some of its tears honestly is a testament to the actors involved including Patric as the selfless quietly resilient dad; Diaz whose perf improves in direct relation to her characters mood; Baldwin offering dry comic relief as Annas attorney; and Joan Cusack quietly wrenching as a judge who proves sympathetic to both parties. Special mention must also be made of Vassilieva who endures the ravages of onscreen cancer (nosebleeds deathly pale makeup the aforementioned vomiting) like a champ and who as a result easily steals the film from the plucky always engaging Breslin. Tech credits are pro but not too polished; theres a rough texture to Caleb Deschanels lensing that suits the storys bittersweet feel. Pic makes fine use of its Southern California locations particularly during a beachside interlude.
