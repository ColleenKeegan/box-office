Comments (1) click to enlarge Movie 43 Video Rated R  97 minutes  2013 This collection of bad-taste sketches and movie parodies doesnt come within hailing distance of Kentucky Fried Movie (1977)--or even Amazon Women on the Moon (1987). More often than not it feels like an hour and a half in a junior high lunchroom the players mentioning shit semen menstruation and the like rather than telling actual jokes. Despite all the gross-out humor the most offensive thing about this is the lazy filmmaking; every shot feels like a first take and the haphazard editing precludes any comic timing. The cast is full of stars a few of whom manage to eke some laughs out of the desperate material (Naomi Watts Liev Schreiber Jason Sudeikis and Terrence Howard who has a grand time spoofing Denzel Washington); everyone else looks as if hes sleepwalking. Among the directors are James Gunn Peter Farrelly and Elizabeth Banks.

And now heres a film that actually rivals Norbits tastelessness Movie 43. While Mama features just one Academy Award nominee and is a perfectly serviceable largely unembarrassing horror film Movie 43 is a collection of comedy sketches that boasts two actors hoping to get lucky on Oscar night (Hugh Jackman and Naomi Watts) -- plus the evening?s host Seth MacFarlane. And it is utterly disgusting throughout. This is a film that finds Watts making out with her character?s teenage son and Kieran Culkin informing Emma Stone ""I want to give you a hickey on your vagina."" Mercifully though were spared the smells one would associate with a skit in which Anna Faris asks Chris Pratt to defecate on her. At its best Movie 43 resembles a risque episode of Saturday Night Live -- a comparison reinforced by the presence of both parody ads and Jason Sudeikis. At its worst? Let?s just say that Hugh Jackman fans who want to remember the actor as Jean Valjean and not as a guy with a scrotum sprouting from his neck should make alternate plans this weekend.

(Relativity Media) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Saturday January 26 2013 137 PM As a film critic Ive seen nearly 4000 movies over the last fifteen years. Right now I cant think of one worse than ""Movie 43."" If you gave a group of clinically sociopathic teenage boys the keys to Hollywood they would come up with something better than this colossal waste of talent time and money. Though cult comedies like 1977s ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" may have provided initial inspiration the true motivating factor seems to have been some sort of dare how many superstars could producer Peter Farrelly convince to humiliate themselves? The answer bafflingly is way too many. The premise here is that wanna-be director Charlie (Dennis Quaid) is pitching his ideas for a sketch-comedy film to a studio executive (Greg Kinnear). We watch as Charlies ideas unfold in a series of surreally unfunny short films. Terrence Howard one of many stars that somehow found themselves in the mess that is Movie 43. (Relativity Media) The first directed by Farrelly brings us on a blind date with two attractive Manhattanites (Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman). The twist? That Jackman has testicles hanging from his neck. Thats it. And believe it or not things go downhill from there. Anna Fariss character wants her boyfriend (Chris Pratt) to perform a scatological sex act that were forced to view in full color. Halle Berry makes guacamole with her (prosthetic) breasts. Chloe Grace Moretz gets her period for the first time which panics and disgusts everyone around her. Elizabeth Banks is urinated on by a cartoon cat who has graphic sexual fantasies about Josh Duhamel. Ironically enough Seth MacFarlane--an expert at packaging the profane--is one of the few celebrities to play himself. Couldnt he have stepped in with some advice while he was on set? Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott. (Relativity Media) Presumably Farrelly has dirt on half his industry; there is no other explanation for the participation of so many major names. (Richard Gere Uma Thurman Gerard Butler Kristen Bell Terrence Howard Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber will want to scrub this one off their resumes. With bleach.) As inane as the above ideas sound they are far worse in execution. There is truly not a single well-crafted joke among them. Despite the filmmakers desperate attempts to scandalize us the only real shock is that a movie this disastrous ever managed to get made.

"Review Movie 43s comedy shorts are short on comedy - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Movie 43s comedy shorts are short on comedyThe disappointing comedy anthology film Movie 43 casts stars including Halle Berry Naomi Watts and Gerard Butler in lowdown segments.January 28 2013|By Sheri Linden Johnny Knoxville stars in ""Movie 43."" (Dale Robinette / Relativity...)How many directors does it take to screw in a star-studded piece of aggressive stupidity and call it a movie? An even dozen and there is no punch line.Comic payoffs are MIA in the bad-taste extravaganza ""Movie 43"" a monumental missed opportunity of a comedy anthology that opened Friday understandably without screening first for press.The one-joke shorts include a few successful sight gags chief among them Dennis Quaid in boy-band hair and a hoodie. He plays a has-been filmmaker whose desperate pitch to a put-upon studio exec (Greg Kinnear) forms the flimsy connective tissue between the 14 sketches.IN CASE YOU MISSED ITA SAG 2013A A Red carpet | Winners amp; nomineesA  That wraparound bit and two of the more promising shorts were directed by Peter Farrelly the ringleader along with producer Charles Wessler of this astonishingly long-in-the-works project. There may be giddy promise in the idea of planting tony actors in lowdown and nasty low-budget comedy but here their willingness to play along is more dispiriting than entertaining. The flat lighting of many of the shorts only adds to the mood of cheerless crud.The star power does click however in the first short Farrellys ""The Catch"" which finds the lofty duo of Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman playing Manhattanites on a blind date. Winslet seems to be the only one in the restaurant who notices Mr. Perfects shocking anatomical anomaly and even as the bit devolves into queasy-making variations on a theme Winslet and Jackman play it straight for all its worth.The third Farrelly-helmed short also concerns a blind date pairing Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant in a game of truth or dare that escalates into extreme juvenile high jinks before a last-gasp fade-out.The supposedly bold chances the assembled filmmakers take are mainly on the level of adolescent prank and teen boys would seem to be the target audience notwithstanding the movies R rating. Aiming for the low comic bar wouldnt necessarily be a problem if the shorts had any energy but ""Movie 43"" is notable for its off timing and lack of snap.Only one contribution Jonathan van Tullekens black-and-white faux commercial ""Machine Kids"" captures the essence of the short form. Its also as out of place among the scatology and mean-spirited inanity as a scene from Bergman.IN CASE YOU MISSED ITA SAG 2013A SnubsA |A Complete listIndicative of how profoundly the movie has missed the boat is an intended ""bonus"" short that serves only to cast a final pall over the whole mess with Elizabeth Banks facing off against her boyfriends perversely jealous cartoon cat. (Banks also happens to have directed one of the better segments featuring Chloe Grace Moretz and using the occasion of a seventh-graders first period as a showcase for male hysteria.)Two real-life couples strike out big time Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber as the worlds worst homeschoolers and Chris Pratt and Anna Faris going for the coprophiliac gross-out gold. Kieran Culkin and Emma Stone fare marginally better as exes whose smut-talk isnt as private as they think or as funny as the filmmakers believe although director Griffin Dunne does get the drugstore settings soul-crushing Muzak atmosphere.Also subscribing to the misconception that famous actors in foul-mouthed mode is a sure thing of a side-splitter is the testosterone-heavy idiocy of Brett Ratners segment which goes to the trouble of pitting two dimwits (Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott) against a badass leprechaun (a digitally shortened Gerard Butler).Aimed-for satire is a no-go in ""iBabe"" a tech take on vagina dentata a MP3 player in the form of life-size naked woman a although Richard Geres dolt of a CEO has a nice PowerPoint for Idiots moment. And in a good-looking but overextended sports-drama send-up Terrence Howard gives the one-note material his all.Not last but certainly among the least ""Super Hero Speed Dating"" with a cast of many is limply executed from start to finish complete with recycled hair-gel bit from ""Theres Something About Mary."" Fifteen years after that Farrelly brothers hit arrived as a blast of fresh air ""Movie 43"" begins its theatrical run as a fetid inversion layer. Is it any wonder that Quaids wild-eyed wacko tries to fast-track his attempt at a comeback by way of hand grenade?calendarlatimes.com---Movie 43MPAA rating R for strong pervasive crude and sexual content including dialogue graphic nudity language some violence and drug useRunnng time 1 hour 34 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO The making of Argo Les Miz and more ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVES2014 winter-spring movie preview An overview of films...January 10 2014Holiday-season movie releasesNovember 1 2013Movie review You Will Meet a Tall Dark StrangerSeptember 22 2010Heading Fast and Furiously Into FallSeptember 9 2001MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-movie-43-20130128,0,779456.story",200,movie433,movie43,latimes

It doesnt just come off as a terrifyingly spontaneous cry of comic obsolescence on the part of its instigator and main director (among ten) Peter Farrelly but as an unintended revelation of (and intended satire on) the very nature of Hollywood filmmaking. The framing device of the film is that its sketches are the imagined scenes from a screenplay by a Hollywood has-been (Dennis Quaid) out of the business twenty years who finagles his way into the office of a producer (Greg Kinnear) and tells him a story of a movie of high purpose and personal importance that hes dying to make--and the first scene of which is a gag about a rich successful elegant man (Jackman) who turns out to have a pair of testicles dangling from his Adams apple. The producer prepares to throw the buffoon out of his office when the writer pulls a gun and demands he listen to more. More gross-out sketches continue (one involves iBabe an MP3 player in the shape of a full-sized naked woman) until the producer has an ugly and humiliating confrontation with his boss (Common) a stereotypically cavalier egotistical and brutish studio head. In response the producer decides to green-light the project saying that its intended to be the second coming of ""Howard the Duck""--in order to sabotage his boss. Its as if ""Movie 43"" was itself a feature-length fuck-you to Hollywood a movie made simply to show how bad a movie a studio could be induced to make and actors could be persuaded to act in. Are Hollywood values and mores really worse than elsewhere (I doubt it) or are money and celebrity simply amplifiers for all character traits? Do the prominence of movies and the reporting they attract bring an unusual amount of attention to outrageous or perfidious or loutish or craven behavior? In any case its odd to look as Hollywood as a unified bloc; it may attract a certain kind of person but there arent moral qualities that necessarily follow from the possession of certain kinds of talent or ambition. Yet to the extent that there is such a thing as Hollywood filmmaking and a Hollywood style of filmmaking (the aesthetic codes for which are from a more unified high-studio era when the production companies themselves were more like closed systems) there are two prevailing strains of criticism regarding its movies. Some critics love Hollywood films as such and find their modes of entertainment their moods and actors snappy behavior sharp dialogue and elegant costumes and sets to be an intrinsically tonic anti-academic inspiration. Others see its homogenization of experience into happy endings its salesmanlike tone and syrupy heart-tugs as an ambient and relentless falsification a front line in the war of public and official lies against the truth of actual life. I exaggerate but the over-all question remains Is the art of Hollywood the rule or the exception? I believe its the exception--even if those exceptions are plentiful--and think that the taste for Hollywood as such entails a hostility to individualists (notably directors) who seek to bend or break the industrial conventions to their own ends. The politique des auteurs was the work of critics who appreciated the artists in Hollywood for the merits of their films not for those of the industry over-all. The resistance to it in France was mainly from left-wing critics who were hostile to the politics of Hollywood movies. The hostility to it in the U.S. however came from those who thought of Hollywood movies as good entertainment made by people who had no place or right to consider themselves artists--and who messed up their movies when they attempted to prove that movies were in fact art. The great Hollywood filmmakers often made a lot of money; they also often faced plenty of opposition from the industry and its potentates and frequently found their situation as filmmakers most congenial when they took the step of becoming their own producers. The history of Hollywood is in part the history of its elasticity--of the struggles between those who pushed its limits and those who established and enforced them in the interest of keeping the system and of keeping control over it. (F. Scott Fitzgerald who wrote the great novel about a great producer was aware of the difference between that great and singular producer and the others.) The range of movies emerging from Hollywood is now stranger and more eccentric than ever. One of the things that makes ""Movie 43"" a soon-to-be-forgotten folly is its nostalgic and obsolete vision of an industry that fostered its own idiosyncrasy which has itself been surpassed. Farrelly seems to be playing out his frustrations at his own lack of progress in recent years and imagining his emotions is the only significant residue that the movie leaves.

Starring Johnny Knoxville Gerard Butler Running time 130 Release Opened Jan 25 2013  Editorial Review Review Movie 43 By Michael OSullivanFriday January 25 2013""Movie 43"" is a near masterpiece of tastelessness. The anthology of 12 short interconnected skits elevates the art form of gross-out comedy to a new height. How exactly it accomplishes this is by setting its sights so low that it actually breaks through the basement -- previously established by such masters as the brothers Farrelly and Wayans Judd Apatow and Kevin Smith -- opening a new unexplored dimension of awfulness where bad is good and what some might call obscene and offensive is awesome. It also helps that its funny as [please feel free to substitute your own unprintable four-letter vulgarity here]. Structured as a movie pitch by a deranged screenwriter (Dennis Quaid) to an increasingly disturbed producer (Greg Kinnear) ""Movie 43"" opens with a bang top-loading the almost shockingly star-studded film with two of its biggest ""gets"" Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman. The Oscar-winner and her Oscar-nominated co-star play a couple on a blind date that goes horribly (yet hilariously) wrong when she discovers that he despite being perfect in almost every other way has a prominent sexual deformity. To say more would spoil the surprise. And quite frankly it wouldnt make my enthusiastic almost unreserved recommendation of this film any more credible. On paper the movie (which has multiple writers and directors including Peter Farrelly) sounds dreadful. The litany of poop jokes racist and homophobic sight gags and beyond-risque humor seems terrible. In fact it is terrible. Part of the almost surreal joke of the concept is that this script would never get made in the real (i.e. decent) world. Except that we clearly dont live in that world any more. Instead ""Movie 43"" gives us one where Richard Gere playing an immoral profane and opportunistic caricature of late Apple chief executive Steve Jobs rubs elbows with Snooki of ""Jersey Shore"" making a cameo reading from Herman Melvilles ""Moby-Dick."" The films winking self-awareness of its own turpitude gives it a kind of get-out-of-jail-free card. Like a charming miscreant it gets away with stuff not because it can but because it knows it shouldnt. ""Oh my God just when I thought it couldnt get any more offensive"" says Kate Bosworths character in the Apple sketch. Called ""iBabe"" the segment uses the sexual mutilation of teenage boys -- via a dangerously engineered MP3 player thats been manufactured to resemble a life-size naked woman -- to skewer corporate insensitivity to consumer welfare. Time and time again characters openly acknowledge the films egregiousness. It doesnt totally exonerate the sin but it helps. ""Movie 43"" is aided by a great game cast which includes such dramatic heavy hitters as Naomi Watts Liev Schreiber Emma Stone Uma Thurman Terrence Howard and Halle Berry along with such comedy powerhouses as Stephen Merchant Jason Sudeikis Jack McBrayer and Anna Faris. Is every skit a home run? No. But when ""Movie 43"" makes contact with the ball (and I mean that in every possible sense of the word) it hits it out of the park. The only reason Im giving it 3 1 / 2 stars instead of four is because I dont want to go to hell for loving it.

Yet if black is white and up is down that could read like highest praise to you. Trust us its not Hugh Jackman shows up as a charming date with a pair of testicles dangling from his neck while Kate Winslet gags as pubes fall into their dinner. Thats an example of the infantile off-the-wall concepts here devised by close to two dozen writers and directors who firmly believe in puerilism for kicks. You wont believe how tiresome bad taste has become.

By David Edelstein Its rare to see a piece of crap that actually looks and sounds like a piece of crap. 127 Shares Share 84 Tweet 41 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo Jessica Miglio/Movie Productions Not shown to critics or Id guess many others to keep the word from spreading like a cyanide cloud the raunchy omnibus comedy Movie 43 arrives in theaters at a time when most mainstream films are polished and computer-tweaked and tested and reshot and reedited and polished again. Its rare to see a piece of shit that actually looks and sounds like a piece of shit. Its kind of exciting The stars are unprotected vulnerable in a way you dont see them anymore looking like porn actors whove wandered onto the set without their entourages or a clear idea of where their marks are or even how they came to be there speaking unspeakable lines crammed with ""XXX""-rated words. Was someone holding Kate Winslets children hostage? Threatening to release compromising pictures of Emma Stone? Did Richard Gere or Hugh Jackman have gambling debts? It would have been fun in a sadistic way to put a camera on the actors as they watched the finished film for the first time and tremblingly called their agents. I need to say at this point that I love everything about Movie 43 except the movie. I love scatological comedy -- the squirmier the better -- and I love the idea of big stars taking a day or two out of their busy schedules to work blue in a naughty revue. The framing sequences (directed by Peter Farrelly one of the films instigators) give the movie all the structure it needs Mad crazy lunatic Dennis Quaid shows up in the office of Hollywood studio middleman Greg Kinnear and forces the increasingly appalled executive to listen to a series of demented pitches all of which are bravely acted out by a cast that includes the stars named above as well as Naomi Watts Liev Schreiber Anna Faris Justin Long Jason Sudeikis Uma Thurman Kristen Bell Chloe Grace Moretz Elizabeth Banks Josh Duhamel Gerard Butler Seann William Scott Johnny Knoxville Halle Berry and Terrence Howard. There are a dozen credited directors and many more writers and producers and my guess is that none of them spent much time shaping the material. This is the sort of sketch comedy in which the premise has to do all the work. The first sequence sets the tone Winslet goes on a blind date to a fancy restaurant with fabulously handsome bachelor Jackman who has a pair of testicles hanging from his chin. Nobody seems to notice the swinging balls but her. But thats all she notices. He spills a bit of soup on his balls and she gazes on in horror and motions to him and he licks -- Okay I think thats funny in a vomitous kinda way but the sketch is just one joke over and over with no decent payoff. Much better is a high-concept sequence in which Watts and hubby Schreiber play a couple who home-school their son and replicate the social experience by taunting him writing ""fag"" on his papers etc. -- but again the punch line sucks. A sequence of superheroes (dressed in the tatty style of seventies TV) speed-dating has the feel of a Saturday Night Live sketch that refuses to catch fire. The central character Robin the Boy Wonder is played by Justin Long and its hard to tell whether its Robin whos frozen with embarrassment by Batman (Sudeikis) under his table offering running commentary on the sprawling cornfield-like bush of Bells Supergirl or Long whos frozen with embarrassment at being in this horrid sketch in this horrid movie. Halle Berrys ""Truth or Dare"" scene with Stephen Merchant starts down to Earth and fairly amusing but the timing of the dares is off. Farrelly and his brother are two of my low-comedy heroes but Movie 43 is amateur hour. The god-awfulness could have worked on a meta-level -- after all these are supposed to be the god-awful scenarios of a madman. But not even a madman could justify the excruciatingly bad timing of a scene in which middle-school student Moretz gets her first period while making out with a boy and is humiliated by her boorish family. (Elizabeth Banks directed.) Faris that ethereal gross-out queen has finally met a script she cant elevate. Emma Stones brainy delivery doesnt work with brainless dialogue. A jealous cartoon cat whapping off to photos of his master isnt funny but I did enjoy the sketch in which foul-mouthed leprechauns get kidnapped and brutally murdered for their pot of gold. You take your pleasures where you can find them. You will notice in the above a lot of ""hated that"" ""liked this"" ""hated that."" The ratio of hits to misses is maybe nine to one -- a low average but not so bad when you consider the sheer number of jokes in this thing. If a ticket to Movie 43 had cost 2.99 instead of the 13 I paid at a ridiculously cold Brooklyn theater it might not have seemed like such an insult. And as I said I love the idea. The worst thing about Movie 43 is that it guarantees therell be no Movie 44.

"Movie 43 review The worst film ever gets zero stars | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMovie 43 review The worst film ever gets zero starsMovie 43 stars like Kate Winslet Halle Berry Hugh Jackman and Naomi Watts should fire their agents.Kieran Culkin and Emma Stone in Movie 43 just two of the stars who should fire their agents.  (Julie Platner / Alliance Films)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 25 2013Movie 43Zero stars (out of 4)Starring Kate Winslet Hugh Jackman Halle Berry Naomi Watts Richard Gere and many more. Written and directed by committee. 97 minutes. Opens Jan. 25 at major theatres. 18ATheres just one use for Movie 43 apart from it being ground into the landfill that it deserves to become sooner rather than later.It provides me with a handy new answer to a question Im often asked ""Whats the worst film youve ever seen?""Article Continued BelowMovie 43 is now the cinematic low-water mark for me -- and yes Ive seen Freddy Got Fingered Troll 2 and An Alan Smithee Film Burn Hollywood Burn. No one should be surprised that this one wasnt previewed for critics.Its not a ""good bad"" movie the kind where you laugh at the incompetence on display. Its simply a terrible movie the kind that makes you feel lousy for having spent money to see it.As its generic title implies Movie 43 is nothing more than factory discharge a series of sketches all attempting to one-up one another for bad taste.Employing every conceivable gross-out gag from feces tossing to testicle waving the film is cynically designed to make you cringe hurl avert your eyes or cry out -- and possibly all four at once.And when its not being simply rude its pushing the needle into the red zone of despicable behaviour with ""jokes"" about incest sexual molestation and child and animal abuse.Need an example? Theres a sketch and also in-movie ads for a new product called the iBabe which is a music player installed in the body of a naked woman. The product runs into bad PR because a fan is installed in the womans vagina and teen boys are mangling their members by using the ""device"" for supposedly unintended purposes. Movie 43s gigantic cast features two Oscar winners (Kate Winslet and Halle Berry) and two current nominees (Hugh Jackman and Naomi Watts) plus a host of other people who should have known better and who should now fire their agents.Take a deep breath for a roll call that also includes amongst many others Emma Stone Chloe Grace Moretz Gerard Butler Elizabeth Banks Kristen Bell Anna Faris Richard Gere Josh Duhamel Greg Kinnear Uma Thurman Seann William Scott Liev Schreiber Kate Bosworth Jason Sudeikis Terrence Howard Jack McBrayer and Dennis Quaid. Your laugh mileage may vary (God forbid) but we can all agree on one thing this is the biggest waste of talent in cinema history.Couldnt something genuinely amusing have been made with this much talent? Sadly this is the best that the 17 credited writers could come up with.No fewer than 12 directors were involved in the four-year production of Movie 43 the main one being Peter Farrelly who also produces.Along with his brother Bobby Farrelly helped turn gross-out into gold in 1998 with Theres Something About Mary a genuinely funny film that inspired a host of not-so-funny imitators.Its been downhill for Farrelly ever since and he really hits the bottom of the dung heap this time. Movie 43 even recycles Marys most outrageous bit the use of semen as hair gel.Farrelly is trying desperately to recapture the gross-out comedy crown he once owned. Everybody else involved in this sad excuse for entertainment is attempting to be both crude and funny a really tough combo to pull off.It says volumes about Movie 43 that the two genuinely funny crude guys in the cast Seth MacFarlane of Family Guy and Ted and Johnny Knoxville of Jackass are amongst the most restrained people here. Do they instinctively understand that even gross-out comedy has its limits? Or are they standing back to let the amateurs knock themselves out?Either way you dont want to waste your money finding out. I give Movie 43 zero stars as not just a critical rating but also as a public service.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Imagine an anthology of the worst skits ever to air on ""Saturday Night Live"" then imagine something even less funny much raunchier and altogether much much worse. Only then will you be ready for the jaw-dropping disaster that is ""Movie 43"" an appalling misfire that tries and fails to evoke the anything-goes spirit of such 70s sketch-comedy concoctions as ""The Groove Tube"" and ""Kentucky Fried Movie."" Morbidly curious gawkers may be drawn by reports of humiliations gamely endured by various members of the star-studded cast but that wont slow the pics fast fade from theaters. Because really there are just so many tickets one can sell by exhibiting Hugh Jackman with a pair of huge testicles growing out of his neck or exposing Halle Berry tricked out with immense prosthetic breasts. On the other hand these and other cringe-worthy spectacles on display here may be enough to generate modest homevid sales. Armies of directors and writers collaborated on this compost heap of lowbrow buffoonery unfettered vulgarity sophomoric satire and stomach-turning scatological gags. (How scatological? At one point a sweet young thing played by Anna Faris begs her boyfriend to defecate on her -- and while he doesnt actually get around to it that doesnt mean the audience is spared a floodtide of fecal matter.) Seldom have so many labored so strenuously to produce so few real laughs. Indeed the overall level of humor suggests the filmmakers did not wish to unduly tax their audience with anything as demanding as the subtle wit and sophisticated wordplay of ""Date Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans."" The sketches range from merely juvenile (Richard Geres electronics exec is befuddled by news that male teens want to have sexual congress with his ""iBabe"" a media player designed to resemble a naked woman) to discomfortingly distasteful (a young girl experiences her first period and the sight of blood discombobulates males of all ages around her) with the occasional descent into the outright revolting (the aforementioned excremental explosion). There is something like a framing device involving an increasingly desperate would-be scriptwriter (Dennis Quaid) who pitches ideas to a studio executive (Greg Kinnear) while holding the latter at gunpoint. While sitting through ""Movie 43"" and feeling minutes pass like hours one can cannot help wondering whether a similar scenario unfolded in real life when the producers of this project set out in search of a greenlight. Some movies should be reviewed; others should simply be warned about. ""Movie 43"" is now showing at theaters and drive-ins everywhere. Beware.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - I saw an opening-day matinee of Movie 43 at a theater where they hadnt bothered to put the title on the marquee with a sparse audience composed entirely of single men one of whom was puffing on a no-tobacco e-cigarette throughout. When I got home I discovered that a pigeon had shit in my hair. These are pretty much the perfect circumstances under which to view this sordid sketch-comedy gang bang slippery with bodily fluids from a screenplay that might have been written over an all-night poker game bull session all loosely strung together by a framing device in which an aspiring perspiring screenwriter (Dennis Quaid) holds a studio exec (Greg Kinnear) hostage hoping to get his obscene magnum opus made. Movie 43 was shot over the course of years by a host of celebrity guest stars doubling as guest directors though official attribution goes to Peter Farrelly who handled the leadoff skit. Setting the tone of whats to come this involves Kate Winslet on a blind date with Hugh Jackman who unwraps his cashmere scarf to reveal a neck goiter that looks like a scrotum and testes which he proceed to dip into drawn butter. What else? More stars than Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World More body horror than the Cronenberg filmography combined with Hated GG Allin and the Murder Junkies The blank shoe-button eyes of Seth MacFarlane Its the kind of thing you feel you should laugh at through a phlegmy hacking cough--and it does get laughs if inconsistently predictable given the circumstances of production. And where most movies fade within hours I see a bright future ahead for this sui generis work which will be passed around sixth grade classrooms by odd-smelling kids for years to come.

MOVIE 43 IS AN UNGODLY GROSS-OUT EPIC THAT HOLLYWOODS A-LIST WANTS TO FORGET Just to make it clear this isnt an ""entertainingly"" bad movie -- halfway through the first sketch I was seriously contemplating whether being waterboarded might be more fun than ""Movie 43 a sure bet for coaxing information from prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Peter Farrelly (who directed the actually funny raunchfest ""Theres Something About Mary with his brother Bobby) has recruited 11 other directors -- including such bottom feeders as Brett Ratner -- to join him in providing opportunities for some A-list stars (as well as Bs and Cs) to do the most humiliating work of their careers. What exactly was Oscar winner Kate Winslet thinking when she agreed to appear in a sketch where her blind date (Oscar nominee Hugh Jackman) turns out to have testicles hanging from his neck? Did real-life couple Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber really think spoofing home schooling by having her make out with her son while hubby comes on to him was actually funny? Did someone blackmail Richard Gere to join Kate Bosworth and Jack McBrayer in a bit about the ""iBabe a music player shaped like a full-sized naked woman thats been mutilating teenage boys? ""I want to give you a hickey on your vagina Kieran Culkin tells girlfriend Emma Stone in another sketch. Elsewhere Christopher Mintz-Plasse freaks out when classmate Chloe Moretz begins copiously menstruating for the first time . . . you get the idea. This particular segment was directed by actress Elizabeth Banks who turns up in a ""bonus segment amid the closing credits where shes urinated upon by an animated cat -- who has graphic sexual fantasies about her boyfriend Josh Duhamel. ""Once you see it you cant unsee it is the advertising slogan for ""Movie 43 and boy is that true. How I wish I could unsee Oscar-winner Halle Berry mashing guacamole with her breasts or Snooki Polizzi doing a reading from ""Moby Dick. Or Gerard Butler as a leprechaun being held captive by Seann William Scott. Not to mention Batman (Jason Sudeikis) Robin (Justin Long) Lois Lane (Uma Thurman) and Superman (Bobby Cannavale) swapping filthy (but unfunny) quips during a speed-dating session.

And then theres ""Movie 43"" which delivered a sharp nudge to the ribs of my 14-year-old self who thought ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" was the funniest thing ever. ""Movie 43"" is gross juvenile disgusting scatological vile reprehensible and in the worst possible taste. But heaven help me I laughed. Like ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" (1977) -- and its unofficial follow-up 1987s ""Amazon Women on the Moon"" -- ""Movie 43"" is a loose assemblage of sketches offering up outrageous sight gags and generally tasteless situations strung together by the flimsiest of connective materials. (In this case its screenwriter Dennis Quaid making a desperate pitch to studio exec Greg Kinnear and his boss Common.) Spearheaded by Peter Farrelly and written and directed by a gaggle of filmmakers the results are something akin to a cross between those terrible Garry Marshall ensemble pieces (""Valentines Day"" ""New Years Day"") and National Lampoon at its most sophomoric. If you dont want to see jokes about coprophilia testicles menstruation superhero pubic grooming or mangled genitalia you might want to check out ""Quartet"" instead. As with any anthology film or sketch showcase there are peaks and valleys of quality; two of the best segments perhaps coincidentally feature Oscar-winning actresses proving that they can still get raunchy. Kate Winslet plays a woman on a blind date with the seemingly perfect Hugh Jackman only to discover why hes still unmarried and her reaction shots and unspoken horror are brilliantly hilarious. Later in the film Halle Berry goes toe-to-toe with Stephen Merchant (""The Ricky Gervais Show"") as a first-date game of Truth or Dare goes to exceedingly insane heights. Its a vignette that requires Berry to commit some over-the-top acts and submit to grotesque makeup but she eagerly pushes things to the limit. She hasnt gotten to play much comedy on the big screen but her good sportsmanship here reminds you that this is a woman who brought her Oscar with her to receive a Razzie in person. The superhero bit an extension of a viral internet short from a few years back plays well with Jason Sudeikis and Justin Long making a particularly dysfunctional Batman and Robin and Anna Faris and Chris Pratt anchor a bit that represents the height (or perhaps depth) of body-function humor in American cinema managing to wring laughs out of material that might merely have prompted dry heaves. Emma Stone and Kieran Culkin play unusual teen lovers in a sketch (directed by Griffin Dunne who appeared in ""Amazon Women"") that could be a short film on its own even if the extras appear to have snuck out of an old David Lee Roth video. Interestingly the bit with Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts (as home-schooling parents with a whacko insistence of recreating the worst experiences secondary education has to offer) meshes with Watts recent Sundance flick ""Two Mothers"" in that both skirt uncomfortably close to incestuous moments. (The difference being that the one in ""Movie 43"" is intended to be funny.) The low point of all this would probably be a bit featuring Chloe Grace Moretz as a young woman experiencing her first period; the gag is clearly meant to revolve around the incompetent men around her but most of the jokes are of the ""ew gross blood"" variety surprising since the segment was written and directed by women. If youve seen the trailer youve seen more of the jokes and set-ups than you perhaps should have but even so there are still surprises to be found in ""Movie 43."" You might hate yourself in the morning but if your own inner 14-year-old still finds this kind of material amusing throw propriety to the wind and enjoy some dirty giggles.

Daily Edition Login to download Movie 43 Film Review 1050 AM PST 1/25/2013 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Relativity Media An awesome array of talent doesnt prevent this witlessly profane anthology of comic shorts from being an utter disaster. TWITTER Despite A-list involvement that includes everyone from Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman through Greg Kinnear and Naomi Watts this painfully unfunny collection of comic shorts qualifies as one of the worst films of all time. To say that you have to see Movie 43 to believe it is by no means a recommendation. This would-be comic anthology of short films featuring major stars clearly was inspired by such 70s-era raunch fests as The Kentucky Fried Movie and The Groove Tube. But despite the dizzying array of talent involved both in front of and behind the camera this god-awful exercise is so painfully unfunny so screamingly bad that it immediately qualifies as one of the worst films of all time. An unbelievable roster of A-list stars including two current Oscar nominees and one upcoming Oscar host have somehow been hoodwinked -- or more likely blackmailed -- into participating in this exercise helmed by no fewer than 12 directors. Among them are such veterans as Steven Brill Brett Ratner Steve Carr Peter Farrelly and actress Elizabeth Banks. STORY How Movie 43 Producers Got So Many A-List Stars for the Raunchy Comedy Providing a rickety framework for the otherwise disconnected vignettes is a thin plotline involving a desperate filmmaker (Dennis Quaid) pitching ideas to a bewildered studio executive (Greg Kinnear) who eventually is forced to keep listening to them at gunpoint. The principals behind Movie 43 might want to employ a similar method on whatever baffled audiences the film manages to attract since thats likely the only way to keep them in their seats. All of the segments feature the sort of cheap scatological humor aimed at the lowest common denominator with the actors apparently eager to prove just what good sports they can be. Hugh Jackman plays a man with a scrotum hanging from his chin much to the horror of his blind date (Kate Winslet). Gerard Butler plays a profane leprechaun doing battle with a pair of lowlifes (Seann William Scott Johnny Knoxville) looking to steal his pot of gold. Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber play a couple determined to replicate the high school experience for their home-schooled teenage son including an incestuous make-out session and gay bashing. Anna Faris plays a woman who asks her boyfriend (Chris Pratt) ""Will you poop on me?"" with explosively messy results. Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant appear as a couple on a blind date who play an increasingly outrageous game of Truth or Dare. Then theres Justin Long playing Robin on a speed-dating evening featuring such potential dates as Lois Lane (Uma Thurman) and Supergirl (Kristen Bell) only to be interrupted by a gleefully licentious Batman (Jason Sudeikis) and an insanely jealous Superman (Bobby Cannavale); Chloe Grace Moretz as a young woman whose first menstrual period results in enough blood for a slasher film; and Emma Stone and Kieran Culkin as a couple whose flirtatious banter (""I want to give you a hickey on your vagina"") is broadcast on a supermarket P.A. system. Theres more but it seems pointless to further describe the inanities foisted on such performers as Terrence Howard Seth MacFarlane Josh Duhamel and Richard Gere among many others. Suffice it to say that there isnt one funny moment in this relentlessly witless exercise which at an opening-day screening induced nary a single laugh from a sparse audience that became even sparser as it unspooled.

Looking at the fractions of 4/85 and then factoring in the two decent bits sprinkled in during 15 total shorts one could come to the conclusion that this was a tax write-off scheme. Theres simply no way they should have spent more than 30 bucks making this it didnt have any writing Or jokes Or acting Watching it you cant help but channel Colonel Jessep from ""A Few Good Men"" a la ""Please tell me theres more please tell me you havent pinned your entire film on site gags and poop humor."" Luckily my mind has already started repressing and rationalizing the entire disaster beginning the healing/coping process. Thanks brain The reason ""Movie 43"" is so awful is because it doesnt even deign to try. These are the jokes you attempt at a bar late at night only to have your friends grimace asking you to sit the next couple plays out. These are the jokes a toddler comes up with thinking hes hysterical. This is the comedy that makes the word ""lazy"" seem far too productive there are infomercials that offer much more in the way of entertainment and levity. ""Movie 43"" is a prime example of what happens when no one involved knows what the hell is going on the ship is headed toward the iceberg and the captain has fallen asleep in a pool of his own urine. Not every movie has to mean something and not every film has to be hilarious but to offer up a middle finger to the audience and call it a ""comedy"" is massively offensive. If we had given the money spent here to high schoolers theyd have done a far superior job. If the talent involved here had decided to dedicate their craft to something worthwhile the world would be infinitely better off. Instead were left with a gaping wound on the side of cinema a January release thats yearning to be hidden from audiences the ugly stinking maw of a Hollywood system that thinks youre an idiot. Supporting this film is supporting pure evil because the economy is fragile and there are a million causes more worthy than this even if that cause is buying yourself a cheeseburger. Compared to ""Movie 43"" a cheeseburger is St. Peters Cathedral. Lets take a scientific look at the level of humor were talking about to diagnose the very reason those who have never seen a joke will love this movie. Spoiler alert for a film you should never see anyway Sketch 1 Continuous testicle site gag. Sketch 2 Incest / poop humor. Sketch 3 Straight-up poop humor. Sketch 4 Light STD humor mostly focusing on old people jokes and ""he forgot to turn the microphone off"" cleverness. Sketch 5 Its funny The short is only 20 seconds and theres no dialogue but still a legitimate chuckle comes here Savor it. Sketch 6 Comic book semen and lady parts-related humor. The actors are all game but the writing had to have been done on the back of a napkin if it was done at all. Sketch 7 Easily the most coherent joke of the entire film this could have passed for an ""SNL"" skit (placed near the end of the show). Sketch 8 A follow-up on Sketch 5 though with halfway decent execution. This marks the last laugh of the entire film. Bon voyage comedy Sketch 9 Period blood humor. Sketch 10 Leprechaun comedy? I guess thats a thing? Sketch 11 A sketch about the game ""Truth or Dare"" that somehow slips into a montage around 90 seconds in. Sketch 12 A breaking of the fourth wall. Sigh. Sketch 13 Obvious and oft-repeated racial comedy. Sketch 14 Hyper-realized cartoon humor. I should also note theres one continuous sketch that runs throughout the entire film involving a hostage situation. Theres one laugh in there for the ten minutes of screen time it inhabits. If we posit that comedy comes from the element of surprise there isnt any skill in placing testicles as a growth on ones neck. That comes within the first seven minutes of the film only thats the entire gag. Its almost as if youre being purposefully messed with struggling to find the comedy where none was even attempted. Here are the people who were in the film think of all the better things they could have been doing instead Elizabeth Banks Kristen Bell Halle Berry Kate Bosworth Katrina Bowden Gerard Butler Common Josh Duhamel Anna Faris Richard Gere John Hodgman Terrence Howard Hugh Jackman Greg Kinnear Johnny Knoxville Justin Long Seth MacFarlane Jack McBrayer Stephen Merchant Christopher Mintz-Plasse Chloe Moretz Nicole Snooki Polizzi Chris Pratt Dennis Quaid Jason Sudeikis Uma Thurman Liv Schreiber Seann William Scott Emma Stone Kate Winslet and Naomi Watts. Stunning no? Thats the largest ensemble cast ever assembled all that talent and time completely wasted on an utter catastrophe. Want one final nail in the coffin? Actual funny persons Trey Parker and Matt Stone were initially supposed to direct one of the shorts here but it never happened most likely because they read the script and realized they were dealing with imbeciles. Instead of directing poop jokes they opted to write ""Book of Mormon"" a wise choice given their musical has more laughs in its opening three minutes than ""Movie 43"" ever pulls off. The truly amazing thing is that anyone involved here once brought us ""Something About Mary"" this now seems like a fluke of the highest order lightning hitting a guy living in an underground bunker. Douglas Adams opined that 42 could be ""the answer to life the universe and everything ."" Maybe he was on to something because it certainly seems like ""Movie 43"" is the final answer to ""how low can cinema sink without actively punching us in the face?"" An epically miserable viewing experience go ahead and skip this one unless youre seeking to answer the riddle of what happens when people dont try at their jobs.
