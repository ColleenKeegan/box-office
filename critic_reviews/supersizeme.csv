Sony Pictures Classics By Joe Morgenstern Updated April 22 2011 1201 a.m. ET This is the film that should have won an Oscar in its foreign-language category this year and didnt. Its languages are French and Arabic but theres nothing foreign about its substance or its shattering impact. Denis Villeneuves screen adaptation of a play by the Lebanese-Canadian playwright Wajdi Mouawad tells a story--masterfully--of courage cruelty family mysteries and a chain of anger that can only be broken by love. Watch a clip from the film Incendies courtesy Sony Pictures Classics ""Incendies"" which means ""scorched"" starts with a dramatic device worthy of Agatha Christie (and ends with one worthy of Sophocles.) A Montreal notary summons the twin children of a recently deceased woman from the Middle East for the reading of her will. The twins Jeanne and Simon arent surprised about the distribution of their mothers modest estate; its to be divided equally between them. But theyre astonished when the notary hands them a pair of envelopes for delivery--one to the father theyd assumed was dead the other to a brother theyd never heard of. To find these shadowy figures Jeanne followed later by her brother Simon embarks on a Middle Eastern odyssey thats intercut with the story of their mother Nawal; she is brought back to life in a glorious grand-operatic performance by Lubna Azabal. The actress and the role deserve each other in the best way. Nawal grows from a passionate girl in a backward village to a college student a nonviolent activist for peace a violent activist for peace and then a prisoner so ruthlessly brutalized by her captors that she becomes known as La Femme Qui Chante the woman who sings through her pain to keep her sanity. The film was shot in Jordan--Andre Turpin did the inspired cinematography--though the locales arent specified; indeed the country isnt named. Nevertheless Nawals life is clearly intertwined with the agonies of Lebanon that culminated in a Christian militias massacre of Palestinian refugees in 1982. And it doesnt matter that the logic of the warfare may be difficult to decode. What ""Incendies"" sets forth so powerfully is the biblical nature of sectarian violence--retribution leading endlessly to more of the same--and Nawals struggle to live a principled life in its midst. The ending literally derives from Sophocles with all that implies of drama heightened--sometimes uncomfortably--to the level of myth. Its all the more remarkable then that Mr. Villeneuve and his superb cast keep the action grounded in the moment-to-moment realities of the siblings quest--of the detective story really--as they cross the chasm that separates generations and slowly discover who their mother was. Jeanne is played by Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin and Simon by Maxim Gaudette. Remy Girard is the notary in a film that makes a compelling case in passing for the role that notaries have played over the centuries in keeping historical records and tracing family connections. Watch a clip from the film Water For Elephants courtesy 20th Century Fox starring Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson Water for Elephants How do I count the ways this movie goes wrong? Maybe by starting with the pictorial rightness of a circus train pulling into town in Depression-era America Rodrigo Prietos cinematography gives the whole production an evocative beauty that it never earns dramatically. The circus of ""Water For Elephants"" isnt supposed to be the Greatest Show on Earth but it might be expected to resemble the exuberantly tawdry microcosm of Sara Gruens novel with its fiery lovers fascinating freaks unregenerate brutes and a menagerie dominated by a fancy-dancing linguist of an elephant named Rosie. So much for expectations. These lovers Robert Pattinsons Jacob and Reese Witherspoons Marlena generate less heat than a naphtha stove. These freaks are noted only glancingly. (The fat lady doesnt get to talk let alone sing.) The brutes have been combined into one bipolar monster that a surpassingly subtle actor Christoph Waltz (the Nazi colonel of ""Inglourious Basterds"") has been directed to play coarsely. And the director Francis Lawrence--working from a screenplay by Richard LaGravenese--blows the moment when Jacob finds the key to Rosies behavior What was a magical discovery in the book becomes a mildly intriguing plot point. ENLARGE Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon in Water for Elephants. Twentieth Century Fox The film starts going wrong in a ""Titanic""-like prologue with Hal Holbrook as the aged Jacob looking back on his life. His performance is too big the camera is too close the scene is being sold to the audience instead of offered to it. But thats nothing compared to the too-muchness of Mr. Waltzs evil ringmaster August and the too-manyness of the doting closeups devoted to Mr. Pattinson who does far more reacting than acting in a movie that keeps insisting on the obvious. Its a tiny point but that insistence even infects the moment when Marlena finds herself a ladder in order to climb aboard Rosie for the first time. ""Can you help me with this ladder?"" she asks Jacob as if he might not recognize a tall narrow thing with lots of rungs. Meeks Cutoff Kelly Reichardts marvelous minimalist epic which is entering national distribution this week amounts to a master class in the power of observation. Much of the action--the outward action since a lot goes on in peoples heads--is seen and barely heard in long shots. The pace matches that of the characters three families in a wagon train moving slowly toward Oregon in 1845. (At least the families hope theyre headed for Oregon since their guide a mountain man named Stephen Meek has taken them on an unmarked path and theyve lost their way.) Yet you watch with unswerving attention. ENLARGE Shirley Henderson Zoe Kazan and Michelle Williams in Meeks Cutoff. Oscilloscope Laboratories Meek who is played with layered extravagance by Bruce Greenwood is part of the reason the movie is intrinsically dramatic. Is Meek to be trusted or is he the blowhard he seems increasingly to be? But the other component of Jon Raymonds brilliant script presents an equally fateful alternative--an Indian wanderer who may lead the pioneers to the water they must find or to their deaths at the hands of his unseen tribesmen. Insisting on nothing ""Meeks Cutoff"" operates on faith in our concern for understated yet complex issues of trust fear empathy ignorance versus evil the mystery of authority and the role of The Other in an encounter between civilizations. Ms. Reichardt conveys all of this with her own serene authority. The flawless cast includes Michelle Williams Will Patton Paul Dano Shirley Henderson Zoe Kazan and Rod Rondeaux. Christopher Blauvelt did the cinematography which is luminous by day and mysteriously dark by night. Jeff Grace composed the score an austere symphony of woozy swoops. POM Wonderful Presents The Greatest Movie Ever Sold Morgan Spurlock has come up with a terrific idea--a movie about product placements that depends completely on product placements for its financing. He admits from the get-go that hes selling out then insists that such transparency proves his integrity. The full title gives POM Wonderful its own line because the makers of the pricey pomegranate elixir paid 1 million for above-the-title naming rights. (Hats off to them not only for getting the joke but helping promulgate it.) Most of the movies substance consists of Mr. Spurlocks campaign to find backers--hes an engaging pitchman--but he also discusses matters of ethics (while slugging down bottles of POM Wonderful) with such deep thinkers as Noam Chomsky and Donald Trump and with Ralph Nader who warns that ""you can satirize and spoof yourself out of your objective."" Its good advice but Mr. Spurlock doesnt need it. He spoofs himself into an exuberant documentary that demonstrates the all-pervasive influence of modern advertising by satiric example and with great ingenuity--talking for example about product placement while hes placed in such products as a JetBlue terminal (where he slugs down a bottle of POM Wonderful.) During the course of the film he helps us understand why school districts like the one in Floridas Broward County stoop to selling ad space on their vehicles and fences (they know theyre bending though they dont consider it stooping.) Toward the end he favors Mr. Nader with a pair of Merrell shoes. In the interests of transparency I should say that I left the screening with a swag bag full of placed products and used one of them Mane n Tail shampoo on my hair the following morning. Although Mane n Tail was originally developed for horses I cant tell you how clean it left me feeling. In Brief Jeanne the single mother at the center of ""Fly Away"" lives with incipient crisis. Her teenage daughter Mandy (Ashley Rickards) is autistic and that incipience can give way to utter chaos without warning. Janet Grillos modestly produced feature breaks no new ground in depicting those who live with autism--both the afflicted and their loved ones. So much is so familiar--the sudden terrors the financial pressure the beckoning prospect of institutionalization the unanswerable question of how to have a life of ones own while caring for an autistic child. But Beth Brodericks lovely portrayal illuminates Jeannes loneliness and the steadfastness of her love.    Cy Harvey who died last weekend at the age of 85 opened my eyes and lots of others to foreign films. Along with Bryant Haliday his partner in the Brattle Theatre off Harvard Square he founded Janus Films the distribution company that introduced a generation of Americans half a century ago to the work of such directors as Ingmar Bergman Francois Truffaut Jean-Luc Godard Federico Fellini and Akira Kurosawa. While its hard to recall what the film scene was like before Janus its easy to remember the thrill of discovering the companys releases. The Roman god Janus faced two ways but Janus the distributor taught me to look only one way--forward with anticipation. ENLARGE DVD FOCUS Caramel (2007) Once known as the Paris of the Middle East Beirut isnt all bombings and political upheavals. Nadine Labakis beguiling debut feature a small-scale comedy of sisterhood is comprised of urgent intimate vignettes about five women who meet at or work at a Beirut beauty salon called Si Belle. All but one of the actresses who play them are nonprofessionals--not unprofessional just untrained in the craft--and they are to a woman enchanting. (The film takes its title from a sticky mixture used in Lebanon as a depilatory.) Ms. Labaki the professional plays Si Belles owner. Horton Hears a Who (2008) Jim Carrey is the voice of Horton the elephant in this animated feature from Blue Sky Studios the company thats currently flying high with a blue macaw named Rio. The film turns enchanting when it plunges from the jungle of Nool into the cheerful pandemonium of Who-ville the microscopic civilization atop the white speck that Horton finds perched on a pink clover blossom. (Chuck Jones did a TV version of the Dr. Seuss classic in 1970.) The voice cast includes Steve Carell Carol Burnett Will Arnett Amy Poehler Seth Rogen Jonah Hill Dan Fogler and Isla Fisher. Super Size Me (2004) Morgan Spurlock took on the fast-food industry--and took the measure of this nations obesity--by eating three meals a day only at McDonalds for one month pigging out on the full caloric sweep of the chains menu and agreeing to have orders supersized whenever a counter clerk asked. The result was a substantial weight gain surprise surprise; a spike in blood cholesterol and a likable documentary that puts American portion control in vivid perspective. The only other movie to do that more graphically is ""WallE"" with its extraplanetary leisure world of grotesque waddlers. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Floating Food Forest Arrives in New York City RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Super Size Me | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; super-size-me ) Super Size Me (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Amidst all the controversy this film has generated its safe to say one thing very few viewers are likely to visit a fast-food restaurant immediately after seeing this movie. Is Morgan Spurlocks Super Size Me an attack on McDonalds? Not directly although its certainly not a Valentine. Rather its a look at the deleterious effects that the modern ""fast food culture"" is having upon our society. The movies ""hook"" is that Spurlock performs an experiment upon himself to see how he would fare if he ate nothing but McDonalds food for 30 days. However one could see that as tangential to the films central themes which advocate personal responsibility decry corporate deniability and emphasize that people arent getting the message that fast food can be bad for those who eat it with regularity. Spurlock is not Michael Moore although he possesses a similar biting wit. However Spurlock replaces Moores smugness with a self-deprecating approach. (Can anyone imagine Moore filming himself vomiting out a car window?) While Spurlock has an agenda it is not as obviously ""leftist"" as Moores. In fact in spreading the blame around Super Size Me comes across as apolitical. Sure it skews corporations but it also takes aim at those who pursue frivolous lawsuits against McDonalds outing their lawyers motives at being purely financial. And because Super Size Me is more personal than Moores movies theres a sense of greater honesty and openness. After all once Spurlocks vegan girlfriend admits that the fast food diet has impacted his ability to ""get it up"" in bed how much more humiliating can the details get? The experiment is the most interesting but not necessarily the most informative aspect of Super Size Me. Spurlock goes on a one-month McDonalds spree in which he eats three gluttonous meals per day. He plays by a few rules everything he eats has to be on the McDonalds menu he must sample every food choice at least once and he only super sizes when asked by a cashier. Over the course of his study he gains 25 pounds; experiences an extreme increase in cholesterol; suffers sexual dysfunction headaches and nausea; and shows signs of addiction. Its not a pretty picture and while the extremity of Spurlocks reactions are in part a result of his excessive indulgence (5000 calories per day) it illustrates a point about the unhealthiness of fast food eating. Alongside telling his personal tale Spurlock interviews a variety of talking heads (although his attempts to add a McDonalds executive to his list of interviewees is foiled by the company) and spends some time investigating why fast food entrees are replacing healthier choices in elementary and high schools. (One girl claims that her ""vegetable"" for the day is French fries.) He also looks into the link between fast food advertising aimed at children and the increase in obesity in the underage population. The evidence is all anecdotal but its pretty convincing especially since it doesnt take a genius to make the connection between the increased availability of convenient fast food and the expanding national waist size. Little of what Spurlock presents in Super Size Me is new or revolutionary but he packages it in an entertaining and easily digestible manner. Its one thing to know that fast food is bad for you. Its another to see that ""badness"" demonstrated. Super Size Me has plenty of critics many of whom are paid spokesmen for McDonalds. Other filmmakers are developing a rebuttal movies to Super Size Me in which they illustrate how a variant of the McDonalds diet allows weight and cholesterol reduction. One has the sense that none of these productions will reach the screen unless McDonalds decides to get into the film distribution business. In the end its pretty clear that Spurlocks goal is not to convince everyone in his viewing audience to stay away from McDonalds. (The experiment hasnt turned him into a vegetarian although he avoids admitting whether he plans to eat any fast food in the near future.) Instead he wants us to have a concrete understanding of what were eating. The issue may be serious but the tone is lighthearted and that more than anything else makes Super Size Me a palatable cinematic entrA(c)e. Especially when enjoyed with a big carton of buttered popcorn and a double-sized cup of Coke.

Docus standout popularity at Sundance suggest sleeper success. An entertaining gross-out cautionary tale tyro director Morgan Spurlocks ""Super Size Me"" personalizes the warnings in runaway bestseller ""Fast Food Nation"" by submitting the filmmaker himself to a diabolical experiment For 30 days he eats only from McDonalds menu. The havoc this wreaks on a hitherto athletically fit body will have most viewers running for the nearest salad bar. While docus slight air of ""reality TV"" stuntdom and self-promotion make it seem most suitable for TV its standout popularity with Sundance auds suggest sleeper arthouse success -- though any distrib concerned about fast-food tie-in deals should pass on this one. Affable amusing and attractive in an average-Joe-post-college way Manhattan resident embarks on his high-caloric low-nutritional value odyssey after first getting checked out by a battery of doctors and nutritional experts. Finding him in the pink of health theyre not too concerned about his curious plan -- though that changes radically as the diets fast-developing harms (in some ways commensurate to acute alcoholism) take hold. One party concerned from the start is protags girlfriend whos appalled by the scheme (shes a vegan chef). To further heighten the worst-case-scenario potentialities Spurlock must answer yes every time a McDs employee asks him ""Do you want that Super Sized?"" -- which translates to 42 ounces sugar-loaded soda and a half-pound of fries on top of whatever fatty entree hes ordered. He also commits to exercising no more than the American average -- which amounts to little more than walking a mile per day. From his first regurgitation-producing attempt to finish a ""Super Sized"" meal to the final weigh-in docu leaves little doubt that eating this stuff on a regular (or even occasional) basis is bad bad bad for ya. Spurlock gains weight and suffers asthma chest pains depression headaches sugar/caffeine crashes and heart palpitations. His cholesterol level skyrockets and his liver grows clogged with fat; he gains 25 pounds. By the third week his shocked medical consultants are basically telling him that his life is in his own hands. Super-gross as much of this is (including a peek at increasingly popular ""obesity surgery"") tenor is primarily humorous in a believe-it-or-not fashion. Traveling the country during his ordeal Spurlock interviews scholars ""Diet for a New America"" author (and Baskin-Robbins ice cream heir) John Robbins former surgeon general David Sacher Subway weight-reduction poster boy Jared Fogel some miscellaneous fast-food freaks and numerous people on the street. McDonalds execs however fail to return his many calls. While not the all-encompassing hard-facts indictment ""Fast Food Nation"" readers might hope for this more entertainment-oriented package does throw in enough disturbing figures (300000 Americans die each year of obesity-related conditions) and informative side trips to provide an educational-value meal. Its noted that most U.S. school cafeterias are now supplied by food corporations whose prepackaged heavily processed items are scarcely healthier than whats available at the drive-up window. Significantly one such institution that switches to a healthier menu witnesses a drastic reduction in behavioral problems -- and its a school for troubled kids. Lively editing and Spurlocks likeability keep what might have seemed a one-joke conceit from palling. Some simple animation corporate promo clips and subversive original artworks (by Ron English) parodying the child-friendly MacDonalds mascot characters offer further variety in efficiently assembled doc.

Starring Morgan Spurlock. Directed by Morgan Spurlock. (Not rated. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Morgan Spurlock went on a monthlong binge of eating nothing but McDonalds food and in the process not only gained lots of weight but acquired a new look -- miserable and haunted food-poisoned and addicted. ""Super Size Me"" in which he documents his four-week journey from full-blown health to a blown-out liver and high blood pressure is a cautionary tale as well as an expose on the power of the American fast-food industry. That the documentary comes across as more than a sermon has a lot to do with Spurlocks personality which is outgoing and instantly engaging. An on- camera natural with a David Letterman-like zaniness Spurlock doesnt limit his film to the spectacle of one mans eating like a slob but pursues a more ambitious and fruitful vein. Over the course of ""Super Size Me"" he travels all over the country interviewing consumers investigating school lunch programs and showing the insidious ways that fattening food has come to dominate the American diet just in the past generation. He also monitors his health through regular blood tests and examinations by a trio of physicians and a nutritionist. ""The results of your liver (blood test) are obscene"" his general practitioner tells him when Spurlock is barely two-thirds through the month. The McDonalds diet proves so damaging that within three weeks his cardiologist is advising the young and previously healthy Spurlock on what to do in case of a heart attack. Wanting to confirm that a fast-food diet is unhealthy Spurlock adopted several ground rules for his fast-food experiment. He had to eat at McDonalds three times a day and he had to eat nothing else. Over the course of the month he had to try everything on the McDonalds menu. And whenever someone behind the counter said ""Do you want me to super size that?"" he had to answer ""Yes."" He found that he was asked to ""super size"" most often in Texas which turns out to have some of the fattest cities in the country. Coincidence? Maybe. Anyone who has ever been through a fast-food phase or is in the midst of one now will recognize the patterns that Spurlock exhibits in the film. By mealtime hes starving. Hes diving into the food. Midway into meals hes out of breath. By the end of the meal hes stuffed. He has what he calls ""McGas"" and a ""McStomachache."" Yet within a couple of hours hes hungry again. He feels rotten most of the time and he has trouble sleeping. At the start of the movie at a lean 6 foot 2 and 185 pounds Spurlock is bounding up the stairs and is in perpetually cheerful spirits. Within days climbing the stairs is an effort and by mid-month hes suffering from free- floating depression. Hes only happy at mealtimes. (""This is the best part of the day"" he says ""when I get to be fat on the bed with my Coke."") His eyes are puffy and by the end of the month he looks a good five years older than when he started. ""Super Size Me"" is full of interesting facts about the American diet. We are apparently in the midst of an obesity epidemic which has coincided with the increased frequency with which Americans are eating out. The foods that are most heavily advertised are the ones most eaten and all the big money is behind fast-food and junk food. Many school lunch programs are handled by companies that win their contracts through low bidding and many school lunches consist of little more than candy French fries hamburgers and pizza -- high calorie high blood-sugar items that provide a quick rush followed by lethargy. Its a recipe for disruptive exhausted students. Spurlock shows one atypical school lunch program that provides healthy nutritious fresh food and does it for roughly the same cost as the junk-food lunches. The healthy food results in kids that behave better and have longer attention spans. While watching ""Super Size Me"" one must remember that nobody is forcing anybody to eat fast food and everyone has the right to say no. Yet Spurlock raises some important questions Is it really fair to expect children to be strong enough to withstand an incessant media barrage -- or to choose the celery instead of the pizza in the high school cafeteria? When Spurlock shows how kids are being targeted by the fast-food industry his contention that sinister or at least cynical forces are at work begins to look plausible.

Super Size Me Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/super-size-me-2004,200,supersizeme15,supersizeme,rogerebert
"Super Size Me makes for meaty viewing - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Super Size Me makes for meaty viewing By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  May 7 2004 Morgan Spurlocks outrageously amusing ""Super Size Me"" is the redheaded stepchild of Michael Moore and ""Jackass"" a low-budget nonfiction stunt with a sharp point of view a sheaf of alarming statistics and the willingness to entertain us until we cry uncle. Like ""Bowling for Columbine"" its less a documentary than a provocumentary and like Moore Spurlock is a born showman. Its one thing to rail against Fast Food America and the burgeoning obesity epidemic. Its another to eat nothing but Mickey Ds for a solid month and record what happens.Spurlock got the notion a few years back while watching news stories about two women who sued McDonalds over their weight gain and lost. The companys defense was that its food is perfectly healthy so the filmmaker 33 put the matter to a test three square meals of McDonalds food a day and he had to accept a super-size portion if offered.In the full spirit of deadpan mockery Spurlock first gives himself a weigh-in a cardiologist nutritionist and general physician look him over and pronounce him to be a fit 185-pound ex-smoking New Yorker. Then its off to the Golden Arches to the horror of his vegan chef girlfriend and his own stomach lining The ""Super Size Me"" crew captures Spurlocks first burger and fries coming back up in all their Technicolor splendor a scene that should endear the movie to the teenagers who need to see it most.As the 30-day diet wends onward and the director balloons into a dazed McNugget junkie the film throws out dozens of greasy factoids The number of people McDonalds feeds daily is greater than the population of Spain; 60 percent of Americans are overweight; 40 percent eat out each day; the average American child recognizes Ronald McDonald more easily than George Washington or Jesus; a 7-11 Double Gulp has 48 teaspoons of sugar in its half-gallon of soda. My favorite French fries are this countrys most consumed vegetable.Its not all genial agitprop. Spurlock interviews Don Gorske a Wisconsin McDonalds fanatic and Guinness record holder who claims to have eaten two Big Macs a day for 30 years; hes as skinny as a post so there. The director also speaks to nutritionists and other specialists discusses the compromised state of food in Americas public schools and muses on the perils of being a snack food executive Baskin-Robbins heir John Robbins (author of ""Diet for a New America"") talks about his ice-cream-related health problems and we hear about Bens (of Ben amp; Jerrys) quintuple bypass. Spurlock also spends a lot of time trying to get McDonalds Jim Cantalupo on the phone; he never did and never will since the CEO died of a heart attack April 19 at 60.Throughout ""Super Size Me"" keeps returning in increasingly woozy circles to that diet and the end results are enough to put you off the trough for good. Spurlock gains 25 pounds and suffers chest pains depression and ""McStomach-aches."" His cholesterol tests and other blood work set off air-raid klaxons and one of his doctors proclaims the filmmakers liver ""obscene."" Lets not talk about what it does to his libido.The company has an easy defense No ones supposed to eat only at McDonalds. Except that many customers come close -- the marketing department calls them ""heavy users"" and would dearly love to increase their numbers. Besides if many Americans arent eating at McDonalds theyre at Burger King or Taco Bell or KFC or any of the other lard barns across the country.With ""Super Size Me"" Spurlock gleefully martyrs his body to our sense of outrage. McDonalds announced recently that it plans to phase out super-size portions by the end of 2004 and has also launched a line of ""Go Active Adult Happy Meals"" that includes salad water a pedometer and a leaflet promoting the benefits of walking. In a remarkable coincidence the new Happy Meals went on sale yesterday a day before ""Super Size Me"" opened nationally.Nice stab at corporate responsibility but you may find more nutrition in the food for thought Spurlock offers; at the very least there are more laughs. I dont usually make recommendations of this kind but if you or your kids have gone to a burger joint in the last few weeks you really do need to see this movie.And maybe go easy on the Goobers while youre there.

Nothing but McDonalds In 30 days Spurlock gained 25 pounds and endangered his liver. Samuel Goldwyn Films Opening this weekend Super Size Me  1/2 (out of four) Riveting and darkly comic Super Size Me is a whip-smart documentary in the tradition of Michael Moores Roger amp; Me. Morgan Spurlock an immensely likable documentarian also handles his subject matter -- the nations escalating obesity problem and the growth of the fast food industry that has contributed to it -- with a hearty dose of good-natured humor. This approach could work more effectively to change minds and behavior -- and even incite outrage -- than Moores more heavy-handed in-your-face style. Mindful of news reports on the obesity epidemic in the USA and of the lawsuit filed against McDonalds by two overweight women Spurlock decided to eat nothing but McDonalds fare for 30 days. The film documents his Mcforays across the country covering more than 25000 miles starting in New York City as well as the constant admonitions from a team of doctors to cease and desist. Its alarming -- yet fascinating -- to see Spurlock transform from an athletic trim man to a sluggish pot-bellied fast-food addict. Spurlock gained 25 pounds and his cholesterol rose the more he devoured the fatty and sodium-rich foods. The scariest and most unexpected outcome of Spurlocks month-long McDonalds binge was the damage to his liver. There are the requisite gross-out moments (Spurlocks first few meals dont sit very well with him) and some hilarious sequences (first-graders could all identify Ronald McDonald but when shown a photo of Jesus they guessed it was George W. Bush). Told in a brisk 96 minutes Super Size Me is entertaining enough for mass audiences and appropriate for children. (Not rated; opens today in select cities) -- Claudia Puig Valentin  This Argentine childs-eye-view import two years on Miramaxs shelf isnt as sentimental as say Italys Cinema Paradiso was from the same distributor. But its nearly as self-consciously humane and on its way to being a slog a warm movie for Grandma despite dark detours assuming Grandma is into subtitles. Valentin (Rodrigo Noya) is a grade-schooler in Buenos Aires who is wise beyond his years -- too wise to be credible unless you accept him half-fancifully. He wears glasses is slightly cross-eyed and longs to be an astronaut a profession that probably doesnt come up in too many Argentine employment agencies. The lad lives with his paternal grandmother (Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdowns Carmen Maura the films one recognizable face). Mom abandoned him because Dad (the movies writer/director Alejandro Agresti) is a brute. Dads temper leads to problems with his new girlfriend (Julieta Cardinale dreamy) a relationship Valentin severely complicates in what are by far the movies best scenes. The wrap-up feels tacked-on and too good to be true with emotions the story really hasnt earned. As a child-of-the-neighborhood chronicle related in what we finally see is a flashback it makes Februarys Monsieur Ibrahim linger in the mind even more pleasantly. (PG-13 thematic elements and language; opens today in New York and Los Angeles) -- Mike Clark Envy  (out of four) Envy is in the unenviable position of saddling two of Hollywoods most talented comic actors -- Jack Black and Ben Stiller -- with a script that doesnt do them justice. Although there are a handful of laughs we long for more. Tim (Stiller) and Nick (Black) are buddies neighbors and co-workers in mundane jobs. Everything changes when Nick comes up with an invention that makes him rich. The invention itself is wince-generating Vapoorizer a spray that makes dog droppings evaporate. Nick remains a loyal friend to Tim whose jealousy overtakes him ruins his career and jeopardizes his marriage. There are moments between Black and Stiller that work well perhaps because their comedic styles are so different as to be complementary. And the fun they have with the word ""flan"" is a bit of a hoot. But theres a low energy to the movie overall. The movies message is a trite if inarguable one Be grateful for what you have. Its enough to prompt the envy of those who stay home and watch Black in School of Rock or Stiller in Zoolander for the 10th time. (PG-13 language and sexual/crude humor) -- Claudia Puig Godsend  This laughably ham-fisted horror flick with a hammy performance by Robert De Niro is appropriately enough directed by British film and theater director Nick Hamm. Its not a fun escape but a poor mans Shining with some lame Sixth Sense and Omen elements thrown in. A couple (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos Greg Kinnear) lose their 8-year-old son (Cameron Bright) in a terrible accident. In the midst of their grief a scientist/doctor (De Niro) offers to bring their dead son back to life via cloning. The couple decide to undergo this secretive and illegal procedure and the child thrives until hes 8 and then things go haywire. While the naturalistic look and dark hues are occasionally intriguing and its twist fairly unpredictable most of the movie is so far-fetched it makes for inadvertent humor. Then there are the horror cliches a spooky shed filled with ominous farm tools and the requisite eerie child who has frightening visions and a vicious alter ego. The movie is so low-tech that the cloning procedure requires no personnel save De Niro. Perhaps the parents would have done well to remember the words of Woody Allen in Sleeper ""Never clone alone."" (PG-13 violence including frightening images a scene of sexuality and some thematic material) -- C.P. Man on Fire  1/2 Not too many R-rated revenge pics depend on Uptown Girls Dakota Fanning for the stronger scenes. Yet once the 10-year-old star exits the picture Man on Fire starts blowing a lot of smoke. Cash-strapped but livin large a Mexico City dad (Marc Anthony) gets advice from his lawyer (Mickey Rourke in a suit) to hire a bodyguard for daughter Fanning in the abduction-happy city. Boozy and broken Washington gets the call cute Fanning scrapes the charred residue from his wounded heart and all goes well until indeed shes kidnapped. The rest is mostly Washington giving us a primer in torture techniques on his way to getting to the bottom of what happened Fingers are severed cars do half-gainers off cliffs and bodies pile up right until the end. Through it all director Tony Scott indulges in maddeningly fussy optical dissolves and sound-editing techniques that Tonys director brother Ridley Scott (Gladiator) knows to ignore. (R language and strong violence) -- Mike Clark Mean Girls   Mean Girls has the same fancifully dead-on tone as 1995s Clueless without the sweetness because hey these snits are mean. The story is inspired by Rosalind Wisemans non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques Gossip Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence (which pretty well hits the key plot elements). The new girl at school heroine Cady (Lindsay Lohan) proves resourceful enough to deal with instant adversaries with assistance from two outcast pals she meets on Day 1. But attractive Cady is co-opted by the school-ruling ""Plastics"" whom she had set out to combat. Funniest of the Plastics is the queen bee (Regina) played by Rachel McAdams who has both the blond looks and comic flair to make a direct hit as a high school villainess. Girls gets a key boost from the supporting characterizations including Saturday Night Lives Tina Fey (also the screenwriter) and Amy Poehler and former SNLer Tim Meadows. For once an SNL-linked movie and SNL-caliber laughs arent mutually exclusive. (PG-13 sexual content language and some teen partying) -- M.C. 13 Going on 30   You dont have to be a teen to enjoy 13 Going on 30. Based on her effervescent performance Jennifer Garner seems destined for a career in romantic comedies akin to that of Julia Roberts Meg Ryan or Reese Witherspoon. Talented at physical comedy Garner has the all-elbows-and-knees feel of an adolescent and effectively conveys a goofy innocence. Many will recognize the story as a variation of 1988s Big Jenna (Garner as an adult and Christa B. Allen as a teen) celebrates her 13th birthday in 1987 but it turns out to be a bust and she fervently wishes she were ""30 flirty and thriving"" as shed read about in her favorite magazine Poise. When she awakes the next morning shes 30 and thriving with an elegant apartment a walk-in closet full of the latest fashions and a glamorous job at Poise. Sure its far-fetched but audiences will likely go along for the ride because this romantic comedy is intended as a cautionary fairy tale and the silly humor works with the movies gentle message of self-empowerment.

"Super Size Me A great McStunt. Slate Sign In Sign Up Super Size Me A great McStunt. Super Size Me A great McStunt. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 6 2004 517 PM Big Mac Counterattack Super Size Me and the case against fast food. By David Edelstein The siren call of the Golden Arches The United States is about to undergo a paradigm shift in the way it eats and the success of Morgan Spurlocks super-entertaining super-disgusting documentary Super Size Me will have something to do with it. With any luck Spurlocks odyssey will do for patrons of McDonalds Burger King KFC etc. what scientists did for the sociopathic Alex (Malcolm McDowell) in A Clockwork Orange (1971) when they pried his eyes wide open administered a drug to induce nausea and forced him to ogle hours and hours of violence. It will put you off your fast food--or at least slow you down. Just the thought of a Quarter Pounder With Cheese and a large fries makes me gag these days. And not too long ago I was addicted to the stuff. Yes Im one of those annoying reformed junkies--but hear me out. While you probably think of movie critics as lean suave and athletic bon vivants I was anything but. After late screenings in Times Square I was hitting the McDonalds outlets pretty hard. There Id be at 11 p.m. chowing down under the harsh fluorescents with all the other pale and blobby souls feeling more and more disgusted with myself after every bite. On those nights I learned the true meaning of ""reflux."" And from a comfortable 160 pounds (Im 5-feet-9) I shot up to a shamefaced (and triple-chinned) 220. I dont blame McDonalds--I blame my indulgent self. But as all my hungry fat cells yodeled ""Feed me Feed me"" those fast-food outlets beckoned. What they offered was the most efficient delivery system for fat salt sugar and carbs known to man. And I deserved a break today. Advertisement For Super Size Me Spurlock came up with a magnificent stunt--but one that seemed to leap from the collective unconscious of our fast-food nation. He would spend a month eating nothing but McDonalds food three meals a day and if they asked if he wanted it supersized hed say ""Yes I would"" But only if they asked. In the movies first gross-out set piece Spurlock goes to the drive-through window orders a Double Quarter Pounder With Cheese meal supersizes it and settles in for an orgy. This is the American dream isnt it? To sit in your oversized car (where you dont have to make eye contact with anyone) and eat an oversized meal of crap. Sure there are nutrients in there somewhere but not in proportion to calories sugar and sodium. And after youve inhaled that stuff (it goes down fast--theres nothing really to masticate) it makes you feel bad. Spurlock mentions McBloat and McGas among other symptoms. A few minutes later he pukes out the window with the cameraman helpfully leaning over to show the vomit on the pavement. Spurlock consumed way too many calories--5000 a day--even for his fit 6-foot-2-inch frame. But no one least of all the doctors who agreed to monitor him expected the scale of what happened next a gain of 25 pounds and a cholesterol leap of 65 points. His liver filled up with fat. He was depressed exhausted and according to his vegan-chef girlfriend semi-impotent. On camera his doctors regard him the way they would a man on the verge of a massive coronary. They tell him to get to a hospital at the first sign of chest pains--and its handy because as Spurlock shows us there are hospitals that have a McDonalds right in them. We can choose to blame or not blame McDonalds (Spurlock chose the company simply because its the most visible with almost 100 outlets on the island of Manhattan alone) but the statistics he cites are hard to refute Americans eat out for an average of 40 percent of their meals; portion sizes have ballooned; and two-thirds of all Americans are considered overweight--i.e. with a body mass index above 25. Half of those can be termed ""obese."" It begins early; in the course of his monthlong regime Spurlock hits the road and visits public schools where processed foods sugary soft drinks and french fries are the rule rather than the exception. Many junk-food-makers welcome the chance to hook kids at an early age. Advertisement In the course of his absurd and manifestly self-destructive exercise Spurlock uses sprightly animation to take us through the life-cycle of a Chicken McNugget--a ""McFrankenstein creation."" He visits McDonalds outlets in Los Angeles and Houston the city with proportionately the fattest inhabitants. He gives time to a man who eats several Big Macs a day and is not overweight. (The guy passes up the fries though.) He talks to doctors lawyers nutritionists ex-Surgeon General David Satcher and a food-industry rep--everyone but McDonalds which wont return his calls. After the movie created a stir at this years Sundance festival McDonalds did weigh in. The company announced the end of supersizing--and claimed that this decision had nothing to do with Spurlock. Fer sher. It has since issued a statement calling Super Size Me ""a super-sized distortion of the quality choice and variety available at McDonalds."" Uh do they mean those salads? The statement goes on to say that the film is not about McDonalds but ""Spurlocks decision to act irresponsibly--a gimmick to make a film."" Is it a gimmick? Sure--a terrific gimmick. Did he act irresponsibly? Yes but what he did is not as far outside the realm of mainstream American behavior as some would have you believe. Is he a hustler? Maybe. Spurlock is not the most attractive personality He once made a gross-out reality dare show for MTV. And I think he makes a mistake in the film by putting so much emphasis on lawyers suing McDonalds on behalf of obese people. Thats an easy target for libertarians and those ""free-enterprise"" groups that are largely funded by the food industry. Youre going to hear a lot of broadsides from organizations like the Center for Consumer Freedom and the National Review which has already likened the crusade against calorie-laden fast food and its purveyors to that other left-liberal scam global warming. Next thing theyll be telling us that cigarettes cause cancer. No I dont think anyone should sue McDonalds. Just stop buying its food. I did and I lost 60 pounds last year--Im back down to 160. I also cut down on carbs (but not carrots apples and other Atkins bugaboos) and beer and I started running again. My dieting advice is to begin by seeing Super Size Me--a vital shock to the system. It will prop your eyes wide open. SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Back home in England Id have been presented with two meager slices of spongy white bread wrapped around a sliver of elderly beef adorned with wilting lettuce. Here I got half a cow encased in two doorsteps of rye bread lavishly upholstered in mustard. That sandwich was my first introduction to the dimensions of American plenty and for a while I was like Alice in Wonderland -- over the next six months I gained 10 pounds. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Which is nothing compared to what filmmaker Morgan Spurlock did to his waistline and his arteries 25 years later when he embarked on a strict McDonalds diet in New York City home to more branches of the company than any other town in the U.S. (including he tells us Houston Texas Americas fattest metropolis). Spurlocks jovial documentary Super Size Me is a chronicle of his monthlong wallow in mega-fat and sugar. Watched over by his good-naturedly tut-tutting girlfriend who happens to be a vegan chef and monitored by three different medical specialists a nutritionist and a health-club cheerleader Spurlock doggedly ate his way through breakfast lunch and dinner under the golden arches of a corporation widely accepted as chief culprit in the nations (and imminently the worlds) obesity epidemic. He maintained a normal exercise regimen and Super Sized only when invited to do so -- which was pretty frequently -- by mostly chubby counter help. Still by the time he reached the last McSupper he had gained a hefty 25 pounds compromised his liver and his heart and was hurtling between lethargy and depression and manic overdrive. Whether because of his sugar highs or because Spurlock has a day job making commercials and MTV videos Super Size Me is served up with a frat-boy jokiness thats alternately amusing (""Right now Ive got some McGas thats McRocking"" he moans as he chows down on his first double Egg McMuffin) and altogether too much information for those of us without a burning desire to witness Spurlocks pre-diet rectal exam or the pool of vomit that results from a Super Sized meal washed down by several pints of Coke. One suspects too that Spurlocks flair for the dramatic scene is all too infectious. At least one of his doctors -- who looks as though he could use a good health regimen of his own and keeps glancing at the camera while registering his outrage at the decline in his patients liver function -- appears a touch overenamored of his 15 minutes. Still the speed with which a healthy relatively young stud can morph into a tub of lard is as horrifying as it is entertaining to watch. For greater credibility Super Size Me is liberally sprinkled with testimony from the usual array of experts and scads of well-padded consumers a shocking number of whom have no idea how to define a calorie though most think its something bad. This would make for a more startling movie had the media not already gotten out the word about whos principally to blame for Americas fat problem an industry peddling crappy food at very low overhead in ever-increasing quantities while slipping in a few new salads low on the menu. Spurlock wades gamely but inconclusively into the debate over whether adults ought to be able to regulate their own food consumption. His anger and his most damning evidence are properly reserved for the fast-food corporations shameless targeting of children (the movie was inspired by the case of two obese girls who sued McDonalds and lost) via larded-up school lunches and tie-ins and producing a generation of premature diabetics and cardiac patients. Spurlock shows a bunch of kindergartners some flash cards Hardly any of them recognized a picture of Jesus but every one of them IDed Ronald McDonald.

The morning after I saw Super Size Me I described the movie over fresh strawberries and soft-boiled eggs to my 6-year-old daughter who has yet to set foot in a fast-food joint. She listened patiently then smiled brightly and said ""Mom can we go to McDonalds? On TV it says they give you a toy.""
