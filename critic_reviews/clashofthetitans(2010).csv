By Peter Rainer Film critic April 2 2010 Save for later Saved Actor Sam Worthington from Clash of the Titans poses for a portrait in Beverly Hills Calif. Kristian Dowling/AP/File          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The clashing titans in ""Clash of the Titans"" are a pretty sorry lot. Theres Zeus played by Liam Neeson with a beard best described as magisterially scraggly. Then theres Zeuss brother Hades a Ralph Fiennes looking even more hollow-cheeked than usual. Demigod Perseus Zeuss bastard son is incarnated by none other than ""Avatar"" lead Sam Worthington. He looks like hes primed to appear in a sequel to ""Gladiator."" If he doesnt watch out hes going to end up as Russell Crowe 2.0. I have no overly fond memories of the original 1981 ""Clash of the Titans"" although Ray Harryhausens stop-motion special effects were zippy and Laurence Olivier as Zeus was Olympian camp. (With the possible exception of his work as Neil Diamonds rabbi father in ""The Jazz Singer"" this is probably the performance Lord Olivier would have least liked to be remembered for.)The new ""Clash"" is of course in 3-D prompting me to wonder as I often do in these multidimensional days whether I should just palm a pair of the darn glasses. It might save time at the next screening. After all were getting to the point where even ""Napoleon Dynamite 2"" is likely to be in 3-D. Maybe the movie hucksters will want to reissue ""The Godfather"" or ""Citizen Kane"" in 3-D? And dont get me started on 3-D TV. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Its worth pointing out however that 3-D does almost nothing to deepen drama. Case in point ""Avatar"" which was memorably described by the comic actress Susie Essman as being the only movie ever made that was simultaneously three-dimensional and one-dimensional. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Clash of the Titans movie review Actually shes wrong about that. Most 3-D movies are in dramatic terms resolutely 1-D. Case in point No. 2 ""Clash of the Titans."" Not that I was expecting dramatic depth here on the order of say ""The Iliad"" or even ""Bridget Joness Diary."" But as a filmmaker you have to possess an ear of purest tin to feature a line of dialogue like ""Bring on the Kraken"" with a straight face.The Kraken is the monster of monsters from the underworld that Hades wants to unleash to teach those uppity humans from the island of Argos a lesson. Perseus furious at Zeus and Co. for smiting his adoptive parents vows to conquer the Kraken. To do so he must enlist a band of Argos stalwarts - they look like castoffs from ""300"" - as they slice and dice their way through a landscape of giant scorpions and other 3-D-approved creepy-crawlies culminating in a smackdown with Medusa who instantly turns to stone any man who dares look upon her. This seems a shame since she is outfitted in what looks like a serpentine bikini.Medusa at least is fun to watch and as a bonus we in the audience dont have to worry about turning to stone (although watching this film your eyelids do get awfully heavy). She steals the thunder from the Kraken who as in the original film proves to be a great big anticlimax. He/She/It looks like a sea anemone with a massive case of elephantiasis. Perseus does such a good job of saving the day that even Zeus cant resist rewarding the guy. He presents him with Io (former Bond Girl Gemma Arterton) a demigoddess babe with whom he enjoyed a demifrolic before she was presumed semidead.A cynic might accuse director Louis (""The Incredible Hulk"") Leterrier of setting up a sequel here. But he must know that Worthington is already lined up for ""Avatar 2"" which assuming it happens will probably occupy him for the next 120 years. Maybe Shia LaBeouf could be persuaded to step into Perseuss sandals. Personally I would give a lot to see John Malkovich as the Kraken.

By Anthony Lane Sam Worthington and Alexa Davalos are beset by beasties in ""Clash of the Titans.""   Credit Illustration by John Ritter There is an awful lot of clashing in ""Clash of the Titans"" but no Titans. A pity for the real Titans were early-model deities born of Uranus and Gaea; she peeved by her husband took the unusual step of forging what one ancient text describes as ""a saw-toothed scimitar"" with which her son Cronos then ""harvested his fathers genitals."" All of which would have made the perfect Lars von Trier film. Instead we have to be content with late-period gods and monsters plus efficient head removal and the odd winged horse but not a single act of castration. How do these people hope to earn our respect? Louis Leterriers film stars Sam Worthington but you will have guessed that already. These days no major production is allowed to embark without him. He is the strapping Australian lad who without warning has found himself cast as a cyborg in ""Terminator Salvation"" as a would-be alien in ""Avatar"" and now as the demigod Perseus in ""Clash of the Titans"" while retaining the look of someone who cheerfully expects to be returning to a steady job on a building site. Sometime if his luck holds he could actually play a purebred human being and stay that way till the end of the movie; for now though he must be content with fifty per cent. To be fair that is the half that interests him. ""Id rather die in the mud with these men than live forever as a god"" Perseus says to his father Zeus (Liam Neeson) and its certainly the better option. As a man Perseus can march up hills and down into the mouth of hell with warrior friends like Draco (Mads Mikkelsen) who teaches him swordsmanship--""Stay focussed"" he says in a phrase that scholars have long sought yet never found in the pages of the Iliad. Where is the fun by contrast in the lives of those who dwell on Mt. Olympus? They stand around on individual floating platforms like bored middle-aged sunseekers waiting to do pool aerobics. Danny Huston in the role of Poseidon gets about a line and a half of dialogue and then drops out of the movie while Neeson as team leader comes wrapped in so much aluminum foil that if I were an attendant mortal I wouldnt quite know whether to worship him or take him out every hour and baste him. The only deity worth his salt is Hades (Ralph Fiennes) who nourishes a healthy scorn for earthlings. ""You are specks of dust beneath our fingernails"" he says to the citizens of Argos. (In honor of the occasion Fiennes has devised a lethal laryngitic stage whisper which works much better than a shout.) His game plan is to demand the sacrifice of Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) the in-house princess; should she prove unavailable he will ""unleash the Kraken"" on the city. A dire threat indeed given that the Kraken is a fabled sea beast deriving not from Greek mythology but from Nordic sagas; but hey if youre lord of the underworld why not shop around? How about borrowing Beelzebub for the afternoon or taking the bogeyman for a spin? Its not as if ""Clash of the Titans"" had its basic legends in order; when I last inquired Perseus was the child of the virginal Danae on whom Zeus rained in a fecund shower of gold but all we get here is a random married blonde with the sated cad making his escape as a bald eagle. The special effects in this film--which you can watch in 3-D though with no discernible improvement--are most entertaining when applied to creatures that have little or nothing to do with the Greek originals. The story comes alive for example when Perseus and his helpers meet a batch of giant scorpions on a dusty plain familiar stuff to fans of the first ""Transformers"" movie and the thrillingly brainless ""Starship Troopers"" but is a snook not being cocked at anything more antique? Say what you like about the feuds of old they exerted a dynastic thrust that made sense whereas Leterriers magic tricks are the foe of logic; for some reason the scorpions wind up as friendly transport for our heroes so why battle them in the first place? And how can Draco tell Perseus to pray for assistance then utter a blasphemous boast--""When I spit in the face of the gods then Ill smile""? That line at least gets a tremendous payoff when Draco is turned to stone by a single glare from Medusa. Mikkelsens face is as promised frozen into a smile--an echo of the easygoing ruthlessness that he showed as the villain in ""Casino Royale."" Like the wiser actors around him he is more amused than awed by the proceedings clearly realizing that as the action slips from scorpion to gorgon and from gorgon to Kraken what is at stake here is not an enlightening quest or a Homeric journey but a series of levels each one tougher than the last. That is why I am in all honesty reviewing ""Clash of the Titans"" three months too soon. On July 10th it will be released on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and only then I feel will it truly come into its own. The film diverting but far from Titanic is no more than a task to be completed along the way. If theres one movie this spring that you shouldnt see with a date its ""Everyone Else"" unless you are looking for a quick low-budget way to break up. Not that Maren Ades film is especially gloomy or cynical; merely that it functions as a fearsome seismograph charting not just the major quakes in a relationship but also the barest tremors. As a result even simple scenes leave you oddly exhausted; when Gitti (Birgit Minichmayr) tells her boyfriend Chris (Lars Eidinger) that shes afraid of losing him he kisses her enfolding her in a comforting embrace. She melts for a moment but says ""Dont answer like that"" instantly putting Chris on his guard. He tries out other responses ""I love you? Id do anything for you. Ill never leave you."" Then as if in rehearsal he asks ""Something like that?"" Ade is hardly the first German director to lay such stress on performing selves--on the way that we don temporary guises hoping to mask our moods only to find that our real motives have been all the more nakedly unveiled. Rainer Werner Fassbinder who launched a blistering exploration of this tendency in his work of the nineteen-seventies would have leered in approval at the sight of Chris putting his arm round Gittis shoulder on a walk and her shrugging it off with the words ""Youre such a terrible actor."" There is a hint of Fassbinder too in the staunchly unbeautiful compositions; when we see Chris standing at the left of the frame and Gitti sitting glumly in the lower right something about the stretch of plain yellow wall between them says more about their inability--or reluctance--to connect than any amount of talk can. They are in Sardinia on vacation borrowing a house from Chriss parents. Even that however is a spoiler; when I was watching the film it took me forty-five minutes to establish where they were. Most movies even very good ones like to release information with slightly corny regularity and care so as not to leave us bewildered but in this one we flail through a jungle of private jokes and references before realizing say that Chris is an architect and Gitti works in music P.R.; its more like overhearing a couple in an adjoining room or catching repeated glimpses of them than like being formally introduced. Even then we dont know the half of it; though we gather that Chris is something of a wet blanket and that his russet-haired beloved is impulsive possibly to the brink of danger the rest of their lives is out of reach. Our hero is tall and shaggy but hopelessly noncommittal like Gerard Depardieu with all the fat and fervor burned away. As for Gitti its hard to decide whether her faintly swollen looks heavy on the makeup around the eyes are those of a voluptuary or a professional sulker; when Chris walks off after a fracas she leaps onto him like a child begging to be carried and her half-mocking cry--""Im so normal unbelievably normal""--is that of a woman shut out from an adulthood that she both dreads and needs to sign up for. (She says she feels spiessig--mean-sounding slang for ""petit bourgeois"" with extra spit.) Again the fears of this film are nothing new; if you spend more than sixty years reconstructing a liberal bourgeoisie its hardly surprising if your writers and filmmakers continue to question how much membership costs and what sorts of sacrifice it entails. ""Just watch how other people act"" Chris says to which Gitti replies ""But I dont want to act like everyone else."" The implications of the title have not been addressed with much force by recent American movies which on the whole prefer to test our nerves rather than our assumptions; as Gitti alone for a night closed and locked the house I instinctively steeled myself for an axeman at the window or a drooling vampire at the door. But no all we get is a sheepish Chris returning in early morning. Like him ""Everyone Else"" could use a serious trim and some of the continuity is out of whack as white skies switch to purest blue and back but maybe that is deliberate. Blue-sky thinking the movie suggests is just asking for clouds.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Primitive Magic Michel Gondrys heartrending family documentary. Plus some mighty dull Titans. _ By David Edelstein Published Apr 5 2010 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Oscilloscope Laboratories) Much of Michel Gondrys TheThorn in the Heart is deceptively ordinary a rambling home movie. The center ostensibly is Gondrys trim white-haired aunt Suzette who had a long career moving from one small town to another teaching grade school. Gondry and Suzette retrace her steps. One of her old schools is a private home and they cant get in. Others are crumbling. She once taught children of French-Algerian soldiers Harkis. She was strict were told but also avant-garde. The film would be of zero interest to those outside the Gondry family were it not for a figure hovering just outside the storys frame. This is her son Jean-Yves middle-aged and awkward his unruly hair barely tamed by a headband. Sometimes he has the dazed affect of a simpleton but there is nothing about him thats simple. Interviewed beside his mother Jean-Yves simultaneously attempts to convey and keep the lid on his emotions. He looks down to the side purses his lips trembles. In the end he cannot counter his mothers stark judgments. So he is silent. See Also Michel Gondry Speaks to Vulture on The Thorn in the Heart The Thorn in the Heart can best be viewedand appreciatedas Gondry speaking for his cousin although the director has worked hard to disguise that aim. One thinks of Hamlets advice to the players By indirections find directions out. Jean-Yves forced to take his mothers classes once refused to open his mouth and earned a zero. Silence was safer. After leaving school he went to work beside his father Jean-Guy. He was gay but never confessed his homosexuality and had a series of breakdowns. Only gradually do we perceive the deeper connection between Jean-Yves and Michel. Jean-Yves once made home movies and the one were shown has a primitive magic. The chugging model trains that introduce each town Gondry visits were built by Jean-Yves in his youth. His mother though regards him as weakthe thorn in her heart. It was her nephew Michel whom she knew to be special. One reason Gondry is so worthy of our indulgence (and he demands to be indulged) is his reverence for the simplest ways of making art. The director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and so many wizardly music videos makes a point of traveling backwards away from his own virtuosity as if in search of the Michelangelo-like spark between a child and his or her first artistic tool. The Thorn in the Heart is full of those childish epiphanies. One sequence ends with a music video in which small children at one of Suzettes old schools romp around in invisible costumesshirts or pants they don to make parts of them disappear in front of a green screen. Their joy is so infectious that your heart breaks even more for the one child whose spirit Suzette didnt nurture. This is an extraordinary film. Clash of the Titans makes a good case study for whats wrong with the Hollywood-blockbuster mentality. It isnt a train wrecka train wreck would be memorable. Whats wrong is wrong by design. The 1981 original with Laurence Olivier snorting at Maggie Smith alongside jerky Ray Harryhausen stop-motion beasties is terriblethe only thing mythic is its tackiness. But it does have that tragicomic theme central to Greek myth that the cruel fates of humans can best be explained by gods and goddesses fighting among themselves like randy rich kids with too much power. The new Clash has been reworked as a (yawn) revenge saga. Zeuss son Perseus (Avatars Sam Worthington) is out to git Ralph Fienness Hades for killing his adopted human family. He barely restrains himself when the god materializes out of swirling black smoke and in a plangent Shakespearean belch informs the insufficiently reverent Perseus that hes going to unleash his deadliest monster the Kraken. But Worthington is too old and too stolid to make an affecting juvenile warrior. The CGI monsters meanwhile are overcomplicated. Medusaa supermodels head atop a serpents bodywould be scarier if she were simpler. The Kraken looks like an octopus with the head of a very pissed-off turtle. Somewhere the balrog is laughing its ass off. In the middle of Clash of the Titans I took off my 3-D glasses and even though the image was slightly blurry the film became more involving. Gone was the look of a pop-up greeting card Director Louis Leterrier knows how to bring out the primordial beauty of the rocky desert landscapes. The trendy technology trendy revenge formula trendy miscast hunk It all fights against the story. The secret of the Hollywood gods that control our movies fates is that theyre dullards.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 02 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Clash of the Titans Directed by Louis Leterrier Written by Travis Beacham Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi Starring Sam Worthington Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes Classification 14A The Gods will probably be more bemused than offended by Clash of the Titans a 3-D CGId to death but otherwise redundant remake of the 1981 camp spectacle that re-imagined Greek myths through a Star Wars lens. The new version ups the action ante with some man-versus-monster battles that may appeal to adolescent boys and a revolutionary theme of humans going to war with the Olympians adds an edge of impiety. But theres little here to improve upon the stilted quality of the original and its even more cumbersomely plotted. Sam Worthington in a tunic and the same marine buzz-cut he wore in Avatar plays young Perseus the unwitting half-son of Zeus who is raised as a fisherman. When his parents (Pete Postlethwaite and Elizabeth McGovern) are killed Perseus is mightily irked by the callousness of the gods. He joins the King of Argos who in a classic case of what the Greeks called hubris has decided to rebel against the gods and their capricious behaviours including Zeuss tendency to impregnate mortal women. Theyre burning temples refusing to pray everything short of declaring themselves non-believers. This turn of events has the otherwise all-powerful Olympians unexpectedly worried It turns out the gods lead by Zeus (Liam Neeson) depend on regular doses of prayer and love from the mortals they created. Like the guardians in Star Wars they spend a lot of time standing around in a circle wearing soft-focus raiment soaking up the love and spitting out mouthfuls of indigestible pomposity. The exception is Hades (Ralph Fiennes who wears the bushy beard of a sad old biker). He travels about in billowing black smoke like the monster in the TV series Lost and plots revenge for his crummy existence in the underworld. Hades gets by nicely on fear alone thank you and sees a major upward mobility opportunity from the human rebellion against Zeus. Working as Zeuss agent Hades quashes the human rebellion promptly and to add to the punishment imposes an arbitrary Hollywood-style deadline He tells the king that hell give him a week to choose whether to sacrifice his daughter Andromeda (Alexis Davalos) or prepare to have the kingdom destroyed by a fierce creature the Kraken. (The Kraken left over from the previous movie is borrowed from Norse folklore one of several reasons why watching this movie is an unacceptable substitute for studying Greek mythology.) The presence of the creature has one major benefit It allows Zeus to intone with Neesons discernible Irish brogue ""Release the Kraken"" in a way that sounds like an invitation to a long drunken party. Perseus decides his only option is to kill the reputedly invulnerable monster but first he has to go on a long journey over mountainous terrain acquire some magic paraphernalia and fight some other monsters before the final smack-down. Perseuss posse includes Io (Gemma Atherton) here reconfigured from the nymph-turned-into-a-heifer of myth into an immortal hottie in a form-fitting white tunic. Also on board is the soldier Draco (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen who played the Bond villain in Casino Royale) who unfortunately for the film is a good deal more charismatic than the relatively one-dimensional Perseus. The script includes both traditional and newly invented elements. Non-canonical adventures include an encounter with a djinn a scabby-featured desert dweller with glowing blue eyes and garbled speech. The same encounter involves a nest of giant scorpions whose terrifying size is somewhat undermined by their quaint choppy movements which recall the work of Ray Harryhausen the stop-motion master who provided the effects in the original Clash of the Titans as well as The 7th Voyage of Sinbad and Jason and the Argonauts. Traditional Persean adventures include the encounter with the three Stygian witches a trio of coconut-headed cacklers who share one eyeball among them. Theres a fairly breathtaking meeting with the winged horse Pegasus first seen descending into a field of skittish similarly winged mares. But director Louis Leterrier ( The Incredible Hulk and the first two Transporter movies) saves his best for last - the encounters with the snake-haired Medusa and the battle with the Kraken. The Medusa sequence while involving a good deal more running and chasing than you might expect has an unexpected bonus You can appreciate why men are compelled to make fatal eye-contact with a Medusa who is played by Russian-born Calvin Klein model Natalia Vodianova. As for the Kraken the screen-filling mud-coloured Pillsbury Doughboy of a creature is massive rather than menacing but as they say size matters at least when everything else about the movie is so insignificant.

Sam Worthington as Perseus in Clash of the Titans. Photo Jay Maidment Clash of the Titans 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Since 1981 Clash of the Titans has been a movie best mocked and enjoyed (or perhaps mocked = enjoyed) rather than analyzed and explicated. The ageless combo of pouty pretty Harry Hamlin and Ray Harryhausens classic stop-motion creatures -- his last -- holds up pretty well today but its wise to approach it as a colossal rolling ball of orange cheddar. Dont overthink it. Open wide. And dont bother complaining if it stinks. What to make then of Louis Leterriers fancy remake? Aside from a few alterations the story itself hasnt changed much in the past 29 (plus some-odd-thousand) years. Were still following the doughty demigod Perseus (Sam Worthington) on his quest to decapitate Medusa slay the monstrous Kraken rescue Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) and exact revenge on Zeus (Liam Neeson) Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and all those snotty god-types hanging around Olympus. Only the trappings and technology have changed. So there are various ways to approach this. One might pick apart Leterriers (Transporter 2) hyper direction and the films variously authored screenplay with a pair of tweezers comparing its kicked-up pacing and burly action set pieces with the somewhat lax and rubbery feel of the original. One might also wax poetic about Avatars Worthington the authentic Aussie he-man lately found in large-scale 3-D genre flicks whose buzzed pate and earnest mien are a far cry from Hamlins wavy-gravy stupefaction. But heres the dilemma Clash of the Titans will never ever be a serious motion picture. No matter how much money you throw at it no matter how many sequels it spawns no matter how much lip service it pays to big ideas like humanity and sacrifice it was is and shall remain a story about guys in skirts fighting giant scorpions while other guys stand around acting annoyed on a cloud. Very bad dialogue (e.g. ""Youre specks of dust beneath our fingernails"") is dispensed by very good actors (e.g. Fiennes) surrounded by effects of assorted quality. This was true in 1981. Its still true in 2010 though the visuals are way beyond what the legendary Harryhausen was able to accomplish on-screen in the ante-pixelated era. Flying horses are so much more believable these days you know? Yet Leterrier and Co. seem divided on whether to embrace the films camp heritage or outright disown it; I spotted just one gentle poke at the original when Perseus finds that silly mechanical owl and promptly drops it in a heap. (Sadly we find no ode to Maggie Smiths toppled Thetis head.) Otherwise theres not a lot of humor in this new Clash -- not intentional anyway. I quite fancied Neeson who wears his gleaming Zeusian armor with the same look of dignified submission or maybe shock that Sir Laurence Olivier sported back in 1981. I got a kick out of the Stygian witches who now resemble talking coconuts. And if I heard correctly Mads Mikkelsen gets to speak this very line as one of Perseus comrades ""If theres a god in you be sure to bring it."" To mock it is to love it. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals 6 Pairs of Alpine Swiss Mens Dress Socks for 7 + free shipping Xlong 20-Foot Solar Pool Heater Panel for 88 + free shipping Carbon Fiber Pattern Case for iPhone 6/6 Plus for 1 + free...

If not the female narrator of ""Clash of the Titans"" a redux of the 1981 flick about gods and monsters and man provides a primer. The Titans were the masters of the universe until their children -- Zeus Poseidon and Hades in particular -- rebelled. Now much like the Olympians once did humankind is bristling at the deities demands. Not quite Greek mythology for dummies the lesson sets the stage for the saga of Perseus played by Sam Worthington. A fisherman who learns hes a demigod Perseus is also the only hope for the city of Argos once the gods agree mankind is in need of a vigorous spanking. After one helluva party Argos queen riles Hades and the city is given an ultimatum Make nice with the sacrifice of Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) to a fearsome beast called the Kraken -- or as they say else. The immortal most reluctant to grind humans into dust is Zeus Liam Neeson in a silvery shift and beard. Ah if only men would pray a little harder more humbly. If only his headstrong son Perseus (product of a vengeful roll in the hay) would ask his help. Ralph Fiennes plays Hades. After the Olympians vanquished their folks the brothers split the territories. Hades was tricked into the underworld by Zeus and sees an opportunity for some filial payback. Poor Poseidon (Danny Houston) makes nary a ripple here. Clearly this isnt his adventure. Since the 1981 jaunt a new character has been added to Perseus saga. Gemma Arterton plays Io the ethereal being whose fate is entwined with that of the hero. She was there when Perseus was cast into the waters when he lost his parents when he arrived in Argos. Like him she is neither god nor human. The problem with ""Clash of the Titans"" -- in 3-D natch -- is that the film is as betwixt and between as Io. Directed by Louis Leterrier and penned by Travis Beacham Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi it doesnt soar (though Pegasus the winged horse is captivating). Its no ""Avatar"" even though it shares that myth- laden adventures star. On the other hand for those hankering for a B-flick escape it doesnt quite stoop to old-fashioned cheese. The cast is demi-star-studded. The talent is as real as it is inconsequential. Pete Postlethwaite makes a touching adoptive dad for the infant found at sea. As the seasoned cynical Argos warrior Draco Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen offers some sharp nearly wry moments schooling Perseus. Moonlighting from his role as Lord Voldemort in ""Harry Potter"" Fiennes amusingly extends his brand of evil as the malevolent Hades. Friends in life Fiennes and Neeson make believable onscreen brothers and wield the acting might to suggest what could have been had the filmmakers decided to take all the rich material about betrayal and heroism devotion and godly tantrums to heart. But it doesnt want to be taken too seriously. No worries. What of the monsters -- the winged harpies the reptilian Medusa and Hades pet monstrosity the Kraken? Theyre rendered with the tools of the CGI trade. And though theres a fine set-to in the desert between Perseus motley band of brothers and some massive scorpion monsters called scorpiochs that approaches the divinely silly magic of stop-mo sorcerer Ray Harryhausen the creatures are never in danger of overwhelming the human drama.

Pictures Clash Of The TitansDirector Louis LeterrierGenre Fantasy Action/Adventure Running Time 110 min Rated PG-13 for fantasy action violence some frightening images and brief sensualityWith Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes Sam Worthington Polly Walker Watch Clips There Is A God In You We Die For Each Other Try Not To Enjoy This These days when a storys as old as time we ask that our effects be up-to-the-minute digitized monsters emerging from the briny deep as orchestras thunder and cameras swoop through three dimensions. But it wasnt always like that. Back in 1981 -- four years remember after a little film called Star Wars came out -- the notion was that a classic story called for classic everything. So in addition to the hand-crafted stop-motion effects that Ray Harryhausen had been perfecting for some four decades the original Clash of the Titans boasted an all-purpose sword-and-sandals script about mortals offending the gods and then having to fight them plus an Olympus populated by the gods of the British stage. (At their head Laurence Olivier as Zeus pretty literally acting up a storm.) It was all very impressive in its stately way and that offered a little ballast for the action sequences in which Harry Hamlins Perseus engaged in pitched battles with a slew of jerky but persuasively physical monsters. The remake out this weekend largely does away with the stately Titans stuff in favor of more clashing. Clashing accents for instance between Liam Neesons Irish Zeus and Sam Worthingtons Australian Perseus. Also clashing acting styles since Perseus is now something of a martial-arts expert and of course lots and lots of the digital clashing youve presumably come for. Battles with giant scorpions now go on for days; Medusa does her slithering not in a torch-lit temple but high above a fiery pit of molten lava. Everythings bigger and louder and faster and if much of the action is therefore incoherent the Transformers crowd is going to be cool enough with that. i Half Breed Born of Zeus but raised on Earth as a man Perseus (Sam Worthington) must save humanity from the evil god of the underworld. Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Pictures Half Breed Born of Zeus but raised on Earth as a man Perseus (Sam Worthington) must save humanity from the evil god of the underworld. Warner Bros. Pictures They may be less cool with the fact that shelling out an extra few bucks to see Clash of the Titans in 3-D actually makes the experience less enjoyable. The film was shot the traditional way then digitally altered (after the success of Avatar) to push the foreground figures further forward and the effect can be pretty strange-looking. In some scenes its as if Perseus has a second Perseus lurking just behind him. In others figures silhouetted against unremarkable backgrounds (which may just be sets) seem to have been superimposed over projections. In other words Though the whole rationale for remaking Clash of the Titans was that after 29 years of technological improvements it could now be made to look more realistic the producers -- by backing into 3-D -- have essentially undone that advantage and made the film look artificial again. The gods no doubt would be amused.

No a fools errandBy Dan KoisFriday April 2 2010""Clash of the Titans"" is the latest example of Hollywoods belief that any terrible script can be made palatable if you just throw enough money and British accents at it. Director Louis Leterrier wants his movie to be a serious action-adventure an epic with mythic resonance; if he didnt he wouldnt have cribbed so much from ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. But in striving for a combination of grit and grandeur Leterrier misses a chance to make the kind of camp classic that could have endured for generations. Instead its a muddled disappointment.What appeal the movie has comes from its two biggest-name stars both of whom deliver outsized performances befitting their status as well gods. As Zeus Liam Neeson struts around in a disco-inspired silver outfit that shines so brightly we can barely see his face. As his brother Hades Ralph Fiennes swoops up from the underworld in his own cloud of dirty smoke like an infernal Pig Pen. Theyre welcome counterpoint to Sam Worthington the Australian actor who previously played monotonous clenched-jaw hero Jake Sully in ""Avatar"" and who in ""Clash of the Titans"" plays Perseus as Sully with better legs. Foundling Perseus the offspring of Zeus and a human woman comes to the city of Argos as its king declares war on those inconstant gods. Sent off in search of a way to kill the Kraken the leviathan who is the gods greatest weapon Perseus and his band of merry misfit soldiers hack and slash their way through a rogues gallery of quasi-mythological creatures.vThe action kicks off with an endless battle against a nest of giant scorpions - a fight that like most of the movies set pieces is hectic gory and visually incoherent. The scorpions of stop-motion master Ray Harryhausens 1981 original ""Clash"" may have lacked the trompe loeil magic of contemporary CGI but at least Harryhausen knew how to direct an action sequence. Watching a bunch of undifferentiated muscular dudes in tunics pretend to fight some imaginary scorpions I could only think how much better the scene would have been were it scored to say the Scorpions ""Rock Me Like a Hurricane."" So lacking in wit and flair is ""Clash"" that such groan-worthy ideas seem preferable to whats actually on the screen.Later Perseus visits the Stygian witches and battles a truly lame-looking Medusa. A trip to the underworld does give the movie one of its few moments of real visual invention as skeletal Charons ferry is pulled across the river Styx by waterlogged zombies. Then -- as anyone who has seen the movies endlessly replayed ads is aware -- the gods release the Kraken. Hes huge; hes slimy; he has tentacles. His attack on Argos is as leaden and unthrilling as can be as is Perseuss inevitable triumph. The movies conclusion promises a sequel and given the economics of Hollywood thats a threat we must take seriously.Why? Because Warner Bros. has spent wisely to buy a hit. They even converted the movie - at the last minute and to unimpressive effect - to 3-D in order to take advantage of exorbitant ticket prices. It hardly matters that ""Clash"" unlike recent examples of glorious Tinseltown excess including ""Avatar"" and ""2012"" offers so little bang for the buck. ""Clash of the Titans"" unfortunately is too big to fail.Kois is a freelance reviewer.At area theaters. Contains (very gruesome) fantasy action violence frightening images and brief sensuality.

Movies theyre not remaking ""Casablanca"" ""Gone with the Wind"" ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Take another crack at 1981s ""Clash of the Titans"" and what have you got to lose? The biggest 3-D feature since last week ""Clash of the Titans"" 2010 proves to be a roaring old-school action adventure for kids with as many mythical beasts as a year at Hogwarts and a healthy dose of smiting without the crazed bloodlust of ""300."" (The third dimension adds nothing though. Save yourself five bucks and see it in 2-D.) Its fight scenes are more than competently staged and some of the dialogue is surprisingly crisp. Still it would be disappointing if the movie were entirely without splashes of excellent camp and though director Louis Leterrier has toned down the ADD ways of his ""Transporter"" films he obliges with some scenes that are so serious theyre quite funny. Sam Worthington last seen in ""Avatar"" leads the way by veering off the path of witty self-awareness trod by Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr. No his style is to set his jaw and march steely eyed into the silly like Charlton Heston. READ MORE ABOUT CLASH OF THE TITANS ON THE POST MOVIES BLOG MORE Who is Sam Worthington? Hes Perseus the bastard son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) the sky god who during one of many periodic clashes with mortals strikes a blow for Team Olympus -- by sneaking into bed with a human queen while disguised as her husband. Zeus must have been a top student at the Bill Clinton School of Warfare. This act leaves the queen pregnant with a demigod. Her husband is miffed. In one of those loopholes big enough to drive a chariot through he ""executes"" his wife and her son in a jealous rage via the spectacularly nonfoolproof method of placing mom and baby in a box and floating them out to sea. The mother dies but the baby Perseus is rescued by a fisherman (Pete Postlethwaite) who caught in the crossfire during a later war between men and gods is killed at the hands of Zeus brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) demon of the dank. The grown Perseus lives for revenge against Hades joining forces with the sons of Argos. With the aid of Io (Gemma Arterton) a sort of life coach and bottomless fount of exposition Perseus and his crew go searching for the three witches who cackling like hosts of ""The View"" grudgingly supply the device the warriors need to kill the invincible Kraken Hades pet sea monster. That device is Medusa Cut off her snaky head and youve got a weapon thatll turn any living thing to stone. As Zeus Neeson sports a glowy suit of silver armor that makes him shimmer like a centerfold in a Whitesnake video. Every time Fiennes Hades comes whooshing into the scene with a great burst of sooty black hell-dust and a dastards determination to infect Zeus with his fell scheming I was reminded of both Pig Pen and Rahm Emanuel. Although the movie is mistitled (the Titans are long gone before the story begins) I enjoyed the tough-guy talk (one mortal combatant says ""May our journey be long and filled with agony and torment and may we all complain about it bitterly as old men"" -- now thats genuine soldiers irony as is the line ""If you dont mind dying come along"") and the constant rotation of fresh monsters. Drops of blood turn into excitingly rude giant scorpions and Medusa who turns out to be a head and torso atop a massive serpents tail provides a fired-up climax. Pegasus a light saber-like sword and a freaky sidekick who looks like a cross between a totem pole and a Jawa from ""Star Wars"" all add to the fun. ""Clash"" benefits by comparison to the original (which was released the same day as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") and most other movies about men in leather cheerleaders skirts. Is it immortal? Nah but if its mythic feats you desire itll slake your thirst.

This mythological epic starring Avatars Sam Worthington as the ancient adventurer Perseus has endured a typhoon of negative reviews for four reasons. One After shooting the picture in the traditional format the filmmakers slapped on 3-D effects at the last minute. Two Director Louis Leterrier and his team dared to remake the 1981 original replacing stop-motion genius Ray Harryhausens handcrafted creatures -- Medusa the Kraken the giant scorpions etc. -- with computer-generated ones. Three The new picture reduces the role of Buba the mechanical owl one of Harryhausens signature inventions to a perfunctory cameo. And fourth Well a lot of critics just dont like it. Lets diagnose these complaints. First the 3-D makeover. Yes it is nothing but Warner Bros. scheme to fleece an extra 3 or 4 from the moviegoers pocket. Yes the retrofit adds nothing to Clash of the Titans and may detract from the films old-fashioned vigor as audiences wait in vain for some big monsters-in-your-lap moment. (And its rated PG-13 -- unlike 300 its recent ancestor in the antique-Greek action genre -- so the hacked-off-arm opportunities are also limited.) But at least this transfer to 3-D doesnt substantially darken the original image as Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland did. More important you dont need glasses or a bank loan to enjoy Clash. Its very watchable in 2-D. I realized that when I removed my goggles during some scenes and found nothing changed no double vision no change in brightness. A Cyclops could see the movie and miss nothing. (See the top 10 movies of 2009.) Second on remaking an old favorite. Ill tell you why the middle-aged critical Cassandras remember the 1981 version as a movie milestone because when they first saw it they were 11. Not that it didnt boast its antique charms mostly in Harryhausens nifty-creaky beasties but these scenes consume perhaps 15 mins. of a two-hr. movie. The rest is a botch as storytelling or spectacle. First were up on Olympus in the company of some swank Brit actors -- Laurence Olivier as Zeus Claire Bloom as Hera Maggie Smith as Thetis -- whose contempt for the material and for themselves for taking this rich but demeaning payday deprives their readings of either the sizzle of high drama or the florid flounce of high camp. Then were on earth in Argos where the half-god Perseus Zeus bastard son is incarnated by Harry Hamlin with a pouty air and the look of a Muscle Beach Andy Samberg. Under director Desmond Davis the live-action scenes are stately starchy suffocating. Third Bubo. Cmon guys this whistling clockwork owl was one of Harryhausens lesser concoctions. Offering comic relief to the 1981 films solemnity Bubo was a figure of George Lucas-like whimsy the echo of R2D2 precursor to Jar Jar Binks. At the end a wandering poet (Burgess Meredith) says that Perseus achievements might inspire him to write a play and when Bubo starts clucking he says comfortingly ""Oh dont worry I wont leave you out."" The new movies screenwriters Travis Beacham Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi took that as a cue to usher Bubo into a scene where Perseus (Sam Worthington) is girding for battle. ""What is this?"" he asks a soldier who replies ""Leave it."" The whole thing takes about 15 secs. which is quite Bubonic enough for my tastes. (See TIMEs 2009 holiday movie preview.) As to the chief complaint about Clash of the Titans -- that the movie stinks -- what can I say? I liked it. This is a full-throttle action-adventure played unapologetically straight. Except for a daft doom-saying prophet who seems to have wandered into Argos from a Monty Python sketch the movie proceeds without winks or nudges; it doesnt cue its viewers to easy laughs. As Worthington told an interviewer ""We take it serious so the audience doesnt have to take it too serious."" The movie relies instead on the narrative twists and power of the old Greek myths; for purely as tales to keep the faithful entertained the notions of gods as jealous and deceitful as the humans they created and a snake-woman whose gaze turns men to stone are at least as edifying and entertaining as stories about the multiplying of loaves and fishes or the parting of a sea. Its religious doctrine as bedtime fable and suitable fodder for a movie epic. The Olympian rivalry this time is between Zeus (regal fretful Liam Neeson) and a new character his banished brother-god Hades (a suavely sulfurous Ralph Fiennes). They engage in a tense debate -- whether a god should trust the devotion of humans or manipulate their fears -- and then put their theories into action. Zeus occasionally intervenes in Perseuss favor while Hades materializes at Palace Argos in an inky cloud to threaten the city with imminent destruction unless Andromeda is sacrificed to the Kraken a giant sea monster. In a way the actors are playing the same opposing characters patriarch-savior and lurid brute that they embodied in Schindlers List except that their pawns here are not the Jews of Germany but all humanity as represented by the people of Argos and that these two grand figures are a side show to the crusade led by Perseus the son Zeus wants to protect the nephew Hades means to destroy. The 1981 movie showed Perseus being raised by his mother and driven by love of the Argosian princess Andromeda. Here Perseus is raised by his loving adoptive father Spyros (Pete Postlethwaite) and thinks of himself as a fisherman not a warrior; a working-class bloke not a half-Olympian. Hes the god-man as grunt and Worthington -- his accent wandering at whim from Australian to English to Iowan -- plays Perseus as a wily proletarian not far from the Jason Statham stud in Leterriers 2006 movie Transformer 2. Thats the way to play this character since the movie is also about humans who have tired of being the gods playthings and are ready for a slave revolt. Perseus will be their grizzled gladiator (Worthington often channels fellow Aussie Russell Crowe in that 2001 Oscar-winner) their smoldering Spartacus. Critics who miss the mother-son warmth of the Harryhausen film and its foregrounding of Perseuss and Andromedas romance are also missing the point. Through his travels and travails Perseus does have a female guide Io (Gemma Arterton) who fans a brief romantic spark. But it becomes clear -- as the young man gathers around him a half-dozen battle-tested guys led by Draco (that chiseled slab of testosterone Mads Mikkelsen) to confront Medusa and save Argos -- that this Clash is a movie of men at work and at war of hardened soldiers on an impossible mission. This is less the saga of a solo superhero than a paean to male teamwork in the style of Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings which itself was a homage to classic Hollywood director Howard Hawks (Air Force Rio Bravo). Perseus is a mans man; he forges his closest bonds first with his adoptive father then with his comrades they face the threat of death together and count on one anothers wits and grit to stay alive. It means something when he says ""Id rather die in the mud with these men than live forever as a god."" The special effects -- the encounters with the scorpions and Medusa and the Kraken -- are fitting rather than astounding; theyre smartly choreographed and shot by Leterriers constantly prowling soaring camera work but arent candidates for the CGI Monsters Hall of Fame. In fact when the Kraken shows up at the climax to claim Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) the creature looks less like Harryhausens majestic creature from the Greek lagoon and more like Gamera the killer turtle in a dozen Japanese B movies. Theres also an odd kinky kick to the sight of Andromeda strung up on a seaside platform like the most elegant bondage babe at Voyeur West Hollywood. But mostly this is strong solid adventure unsullied by the chic contempt of camp -- and despite its critics well worth your dollars at least for the 2-D version. In fact Id bet you that 30 years from now if this remake is remade todays kids grown into the middle-agers of 2040 will have memories every bit as protective as their elders. Theyll revere this Clash and insist that the new movie include their favorite character the daft prophet. Watch TIMEs video ""The 3-D Experience and You An Odd Todd Cartoon.""

Warner Bros. By Joe Morgenstern Updated April 2 2010 1201 a.m. ET A few more 3-D spectacles like ""Clash of the Titans"" and audiences will be clamoring for 2-D. Whats wrong with this sad fiasco goes far beyond its visual deficits but lets start there. The film a remake of a 1981 action fantasy loosely based on Greek mythology was shot with conventional cameras then hastily reprocessed into an approximation of 3-D in the wake of the stunning success of ""Avatar."" The result is 2.5-D a murkily virtual virtuality. You get an ambiguous sense of depth at a steep price that includes but isnt confined to the box-office surcharge that the studios have begun to impose on such attractions in a sudden frenzy of delusion and greed. Watch a clip from ""Clash of the Titans"" a remake of the cult classic featuring giant scorpions harpies blind witches Greek Goods and Liam Neeson in a shiny suit of armor. Video courtesy of Warner Bros. First of all the glasses you use to watch this production sit heavily on the nose--their so-called active-shutter technology involves built-in electronics--and they soak up so much light that day scenes turn into an unintended twilight of the gods while night scenes look as if someone forgot to light the set. Figures in the foreground range from partially modeled to inexplicably flat while computer-generated effects are occasionally impressive (the beheading of Medusa) but mostly indifferent (a big gold coin thats scaled out over the audience doesnt make it past the first few rows). Whats more the visual murk creates emotional murk; the experience is such a downer that its hard to find moments of up. Now living in a democracy means youre free to take the glasses off at any time without fear of retribution from Warner Bros. or the exhibitors. (Youre also free to choose a theater thats showing a 2-D version.) I removed mine after 40 minutes and discovered that the images on the screen were not only bright but reasonably sharp so the glasses stayed in my lap for the duration. Yet bright images cant sustain the illusion of life without drama and in that respect ""Clash of the Titans"" which was directed by Louis Letterier is strictly no-D. Sam Worthington--most recently and multidimensionally of ""Avatar""--is Perseus born of a god but raised as a man and pretty much played as a block of wood. ""I dont know why I was born or what I am"" he laments at one point and you can relate since the movie doesnt know what to do with him. Hes sent on endless battles to defeat Hades (Ralph Fiennes whispering and simpering) before that misshapen wretch can seize power from his fatuous brother Zeus (Liam Neeson squirming and declaiming) and turn the earth into a living hell. Having established Perseus as a fearless hunk however the misshapen script wont give him a girl to love. Hes got a beautiful guide in Gemma Artertons Io; she turns up every now and then to say do this dont do that or go this way instead of that way. Yet theres no chemistry between them because chemistry requires proximity and Io seems to be operating on some ethereal plane. (Though she could be just another victim of the disorienting photography.) And in a masterstroke of dramatic perversity Io is given to Perseus--as a gift from the gods--just before the movie ends. Presumably hell enjoy her but we dont get to watch. ENLARGE Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus in The Last Song. Touchstone Pictures The Last Song Disney has a lot riding on ""The Last Song"" a romantic tale that brings Miley Cyrus out of her preteen--and immensely profitable--Hannah Montana phase into the role of an amorous teenage girl. Many of the early reviews have heaped scorn on the film some aspects of which invite it. For one thing this is second-tier melodrama from Nicholas Sparks deaths favorite franchisee so the cliches come moist and shameless. For another Ms. Cyruss Ronnie Miller a piano prodigy living in New York with her mother and little brother must get through lots of anger at having to spend a summer in coastal Georgia with her estranged father whos played by Greg Kinnear. Thats a really bad idea. The young star doesnt yet have the skill to play anger interestingly and the director Julie Anne Robinson hasnt helped matters by keeping the camera on her face during tight-jawed glowers that sometimes stay fixed for the full length of a scene. Speakeasy The Last Song Tests Miley Cyrus Nicholas Sparks Box Office Appeal Nevertheless and at the risk of inviting scorn too I must say that ""The Last Song"" takes a sharp turn for the better when Ronnie and a poor big rich boy played by Liam Hemsworth fall in love. Hes handsome and charming while she becomes sweet and endearing. ""Youre not like other girls"" he tells her; its believable because she believes it. Some of the sappiness must be seen to be believed--a clumsy subplot involving violence and arson an ecologically correct salute to cute sea turtle hatchlings. But the movie moves Ms. Cyrus from where she was to more or less where she and her handlers wanted to be and Mr. Kinnears musician father Steve adds a generous measure of grace. Instead of telling Ronnie that shes not like other girls Steve tells her with genuine poignancy that she doesnt yet know who she is. Its an expression of faith that shell soon find out and that the discovery will delight her. The Secret of Kells ENLARGE A scene from The Secret of Kells. GKIDS From our vantage point--or disadvantage point--in time its impossible to project ourselves into the minds of the medieval monks who created the Book of Kells the magnificently illuminated manuscript that spent centuries at the Abbey of Kells and can currently be seen and studied at the Trinity College Library in Dublin. Were they performing an act of pure devotion or pursuing beauty as well? Theres no mystery though about why the people who made ""The Secret of Kells"" did what they did. This wonderfully strange and exquisite little feature was created especially for young children to celebrate the book through another kind of illumination thats been falling into disuse--hand-drawn animation. The story concerns a Celtic boy named Brendan who helps a master illuminator finish the book then protects it from Viking marauders. (The director was Tomm Moore and the co-director was Nora Twomey.) But the soul of the film lies in its ravishing colors and in exuberantly stylized images that pay homage to Celtic culture and design together with techniques and motifs that evoke Matisse Miyazaki and the minimalist cartoons of UPA. Since the emphasis is more on graphic variety than continuity theres almost a sense of too-muchness but thats fine; its another expression of devotion. Find related television listings at LocateTV. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE In Bruges (2008) Ralph Fiennes is the scarily explosive boss of two hit men played by Brendan Gleeson (who voiced Abbot Cellach in ""The Secret of Kells"") and Colin Farrell. He sends them to Bruges with instructions to wait--not for Godot though theres a bit of that feeling but for further instructions about who gets killed next. The violence can be shocking but Martin McDonaghs film is also very funny and a morality play thats deeply affecting. Jordan Prentice is a racist dwarf and Clemence Poesy plays Chloe a woman who is not but also is the person she seems to be. ENLARGE Little Miss Sunshine (2006) A dysfunctional-family comedy with a difference--the function progresses from dys to full and loving. Seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) wants to compete for the title of Little Miss Sunshine in the California contest of the same name. To do so however she must mobilize her family a quarrelsome but entertaining group of depressives. Greg Kinnear is Olives father Richard a motivational speaker whose own will to win is following his career down the drain. The cast includes Toni Collette Steve Carell and Alan Arkin. Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris directed from an original screenplay by Michael Arndt. ENLARGE The Triplets of Belleville (2003) One viewing isnt enough to take in the eccentric pleasures of Sylvain Chomets animated feature. (Two of its producers Didier Brunner and Viviane Vanfleteren served in similar capacities on ""The Secret of Kells."") The absence of conventional dialogue helps draw one into the amusing and moving world of a club-footed grandmother her spoke-thin bicycle-racer grandson and the three old crones of the title. Superannuated vaudevillians they turn up when the action moves from bicycle racing in 1960s France to bicyclist-chasing in Belleville an American city thats an amalgam of New York Montreal Mont Saint-Michel France and the metropolis from ""Metropolis."" --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump New Sandy Hook Elementary School to Open Soon Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Pictures Star Tribune Sam Worthington fresh off epic battles in ""Avatar"" swaps blue skin for sandals and a sword as he fights Medusa in ""Clash of the Titans."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint At the moment when Sam Worthington trapped inside a giant scorpion sword-hacked his way through the dorsal carapace and poked the upper half of his body through the opening as if it were a sunroof I fell in love with ""Clash of the Titans."" We already had witnessed a high-velocity aerial attack by harpies a rebellious king zapped by Zeus lightning bolts that render his skin the texture of a burnt weenie several smoke-and-cinders appearances by Hades and a monster assassins lopped-off hand skittering away like a big pink crab. When it became clear that the film would be one long crisis with brief pit stops for quick infusions of plot I decided to enjoy the ride. This movie literally puts its heroes -- and us -- through hell and out the other side. You fight this kind of stuff itll tear you to shreds. It goes without saying that ""Clash"" is all flash trash and crash a tasty hunk of baloney mindless yet shamelessly thrilling. It is untroubled by fidelity to the 1981 adventure of the same name let alone to Greek mythology. It pillages folklore from around the globe tossing in a squad of Arabian Djinn and a Kraken sea monster from Scandinavia (and/or the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies). In the sequels I expect to see a Chinese dragon Bigfoot and a chupacabra. The story begins in Argos where Perseus (Worthington) ponders his fate. Hes a demigod the mortal son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) who feels more loyalty to the humans who raised him with love than the all-powerful father who abandoned him. When the deities of Mount Olympus orphan him hes eager to side with men in their battle against the cruel capricious gods. The Olympians draw on human prayers for their strength except treacherous Hades (Ralph Fiennes) who thrives on fear. Zeus dispatches Hades to knock the mortals back into line. They have 10 days to acquiesce. Otherwise Hades will ""release the Kraken"" a threat so melodramatically cheesy it has already replaced ""thats what she said"" as the all-occasions pop-culture punch line. The movie kicks into life in the frantic and near-nonstop battle sequences as the mortals take on the gods minions. Director Louis Leterrier (""The Incredible Hulk"" the Ed Norton one) keeps tension in the story by sadistically winnowing down Perseus legion. You know the marquee star will survive but you fret about the colorful supporting characters. Worthington has a hearty masculinity and hes remarkably resourceful at hacking and slashing. Hes sort of a stiff though even when the movie gives him comedic opportunities. When hes 20 fathoms down trying in vain to save someone from drowning he bellows ""NOOOOO"" in a gush of air bubbles. People around me were giggling and rightly so. Worthington has a Shatneresque heaviness about him; even as a slime-covered chest burster popping out of that giant scorpion he doesnt seem to be in on the joke. CLASH OF THE TITANS  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for fantasy action violence some frightening images and brief sensuality. The laughs in the film come from the heavyweight actors slumming through their roles. Neeson is all deadpan decorum even when hes wearing a ludicrous suit of armor that makes him look like Lady Gagas grandpa. Fiennes oozes deliciously creepy perversity bugging his eyes croaking his lines and slithering around the set in a preposterous wig. The old pros understand that what is most entertaining about ""Clash of the Titans"" is inextricable from what is most absurd. A word on the films much-discussed post-production 3D effects. They add nothing to the experience. Skip the glasses and buy a bigger bucket of popcorn.

"Clash of the Titans reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Clash of the Titans reviewed. Clash of the Titans reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 1 2010 529 PM Half Mortal Totally Stupid The gods battle in Clash of the Titans. By Dana Stevens Clash of the Titans In Louis Leterriers Clash of the Titans (Warner Bros.) Sam Worthington bum-rushes our eyeballs in a 3-D fantasy-adventure for the second time this year. In fact Clash of the Titans bears some remarkable similarities to Avatar In both films Worthington plays a half-human half-something-else creature who must mediate between the two worlds and eventually choose between mortal life and existence on a different higher plane. Instead of the alien-human hybrid Sully Worthington here plays the demigod Perseus offspring of Zeus and the earthly queen Danae. Like Sully Perseus falls for a woman on the other side of the human/nonhuman divide Instead of a Navi princess his love object is the demi-goddess Io (Gemma Arterton). Theres even a moment in both movies when Worthington must leap from the back of one winged beast onto the back of another. Avatar has taken a lot of heat for being weak on story and overly reliant on visual effects but compared with this witless chaotic mess of a movie James Camerons epic looks worthy of the ancient Greek authors--Herodotus Hesiod Homer--who first told Perseus tale. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Clash actually starts strong with a few imaginative set pieces that promise more than the movie as a whole delivers. As a newborn Perseus is hurled into the sea by his father Acrisius (Jason Flemyng) who disbelieves his wifes claim that she was impregnated by Zeus. The baby is discovered by a kind fisherman played by Pete Postlethwaite who packs a memorable performance into a tiny wedge of screen time. After a series of misfortunes Perseus finds himself conscripted to save the city of Argos from an assault by the gods who have been angered by the growing hubris of mortals. (A scene at the decadent court of Argos in which we witness this hubris hints pleasantly at an I Claudius-style orgy that sadly never materializes.) To show the gods whats what Perseus must battle a succession of tennis balls suspended in front of green screens--I mean fearsome mythological beasts. Advertisement The scene in Medusas lair when Perseus enters and (spoiler alert for those unacquainted with basic Western mythology) beheads the snake-haired beast is dispiritingly clamorous and unscary. Compared with the nearly dialogue-free sequence in the 1981 original in which Harry Hamlin slew a frightful claymation Medusa created by the stop-motion legend Ray Harryhausen this version feels like a video game for undemanding classics nerds. Medusa herself an all-digital creation with a snakes body and a Calvin Klein modelshead is so disappointing you want to throw popcorn at the screen. The producers made a big mistake in not casting a known actress for the face of Medusa--remember how effective it was when Angelina Jolie emerged from the bog as Grendels mother in Beowulf? In a movie this dependent on effects and big action sequences the actors serve mostly as connective tissue. Ralph Fiennes does bring a haunting saturnine quality to the character of Hades whos written as a bitter outcast a la Miltons Satan. But Neeson is a bit stiff as Zeus and Worthingtons Perseus is stalwart to the point of inexpressivity. As Io Gemma Arterton last seen covered in crude oil in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace struggles with both the films worst dialogue--pinned to the ground by an ardent Perseus she murmurs ""Calm your storm""--and its worst costumes Only Bjork could pull off a poncho that seems to have been fashioned from a used mop. The post-production 3-D looks youve-got-to-be-kidding bad. The actors seem surrounded at all times by hovering nimbuses that dont suggest divine radiance so much as they do the effects of a recent concussion. Theres one digital effect--Perseus winged horse Pegasus--that works wonderfully maybe because the animal seems to have been created by filming a real running horse and then adding CG wings. And the gods palace on Olympus is furnished with a beautifully imagined semitransparent floor of clouds below which the surface of the earth is occasionally visible. But everyone in the Greek pantheon with the exception of Zeus Hades and very briefly Poseidon (Danny Huston) just stands around silently on that fabulous floor. The gods and goddesses are never even introduced by name in a formal catalog like the one Laurence Olivier ticks off in the originals opening scene. Were reduced to scanning them at a distance for identifying details--anybody got a trident? An owl? At moments like these Clash seems to be deliberately steering clear of camp when in fact it should have steered straight into camp and stepped on the gas.

No way will I make a case for the first Titans in 1981 but at least the fabled Ray Harryhausen created magnificent monsters. This remake directed by Louis Letterier (The Incredible Hulk) purports to be in 3D but was actually retrofitted to exploit the appetite for the extra dimension fostered by the success of Avatar. So youll be paying up to six bucks extra for a ticket to wear 3D glasses you dont need. Take off your glasses during a movie actually filmed in 3D and youll see a blurry image.

The film is a sham with good actors going for the paycheck and using beards and heavy makeup to hide their shame. For that Avatar feeling theres Sam Worthington as Perseus the bastard son of a human mother and the god Zeus (Liam Neeson at his most bombastic). Zeuss brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes channeling Lord Voldemort) wants to declare war on humans. Perseus must save the day by fighting the Medussa a head with a giant tail and laying waste to the Kraken a sea monster who is actually another head with a giant tail. Staring at the Medussa can turn you to stone. The godawful dialogue did it for me. Neeson roaring ""release the Kraken"" belongs in the camp time capsule. It will haunt him for years.

With zero magnetism Worthington is an avatar of a hero. (Warner Bros) Joe Neumaier Thursday April 1 2010 252 PM Title Clash of the Titans The 3-D technology tacked onto ""Clash of the Titans"" is like the coins put on the eyes of the dead for Charon the Stygian ferryman. Its bribery to accept a lifeless lump.A remake of a cheesy but fun 1981 flick - notable for its Olympian gods played by acting nobility (Laurence Olivier as Zeus Maggie Smith as Thetis Claire Bloom as Hera and well Ursula Andress as Aphrodite) and for the herky-jerky magic of F/X wizard Ray Harryhausen - this new adventure sees itself as ""Lord of the Rings"" redux but is more like a Halloween parade underwritten by BAM.Even the fun of hammy performances is lost in the mythic stupidity.Sam Worthington - officially now the patron saint of geeks - is Perseus bastard son of Zeus (Liam Neeson). Zeus and his pals on Mount Olympus arent getting enough reverence so theyll bring a world of hurt on the defiant city of Argos unless Zeus underworld-ruling brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) can get them to fear the gods again using black smoke and his deformed lackey Calibos (Jason Flemyng). You cant trust a guy who rules the underworld though which the all-knowing Zeus apparently forgets.Its up to fisherman-demigod Perseus to face blind witches and behead Medusa before preventing a giant sea beast called the Kraken from devouring beautiful Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) and bringing new power to Hades.Like Zeus shiny armor the visuals in ""Clash of the Titans"" are distracting but not special enough to be memorable. The simpler things work best (winged horses still look cool giant scorpions have sting) and the asp-haired Medusa delivers the necessary nasty bites. The much-ballyhooed Kraken however looks like a leftover monster from director Louis Leterriers previous movie 2008s ""The Incredible Hulk.""It doesnt help that the actors are either too over-the-top or oddly withholding. Worthington remains a haircut in search of a person; with his zero magnetism hes an avatar of a hero.His elders provide no guide. Its a wonder Neeson can sleepwalk in all that tinfoil while Fiennes with his ratty Rasputin beard and Dog the Bounty Hunter hair mewls and waves his arms like a bat. These great actors may just be playing good god/bad god - its Aslan the Lion versus Lord Voldemort - but they dont get points for just showing up.It may seem beside the point to say the flesh-and-blood elements disappoint in an effects-heavy epic (one with 3-D added just prior to release at that). But even here the fantastical and the mortal need each other to make things work. With that missing and an inadequate action punch just release the Kraken straight to DVD.              jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Clash of the Titans amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << The Last Song There is Truth Love is Real >> Clash of the Titans The Theogony Greek mythologys first record of events establishes a world of continual revolt. Ouranos the sky fought for and lost power to his sons the Titans. In turn they fought for and lost power to their own sons headed by Zeus. And eons into Zeus reign over Olympus humans--his ""children"" or really pets--want control over their lives. Still theyre divided over how much control. The royals want merely to dispatch with the gods; their peasants want to get rid of both bums. French director Louis Leterrier loves this world and all the hostile complete-sentence speaking cranks in it. But Clash of the Titans feels like he fought--and lost--his own battle for control. The tidy 90-minute flick feels cut down from a grander smarter if duller epic where a demigod (Sam Worthington) is thrust into a three-way battle between mankind Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and his older brother Zeus (Liam Neeson). The gods are weakened by humans disinterest. To restore awe Hades wants to use fear and narcissistic Zeus--bright and fuzzy like hes been run through a VCR--thinks he can spin fear into prayer. Again go-to action hero Worthington is swamped by a series of set pieces deserts marred by bulldozer-sized roaring scorpions hellish Hades and the home of Medusa and of course the town of Argos as it bitterly readies itself for the Kraken--70 minutes of build-up climaxing in a slow legs-to-face reveal that stretches on longer than microwaving a TV dinner. At my screening the word ""Kraken"" made people burst into giggles. An ominous sign for the fortunes of this not-terrible (though not-good) blockbuster but not quite as ominous as the sign of at least a dozen people choosing to watch the 3D screening without their 3D glasses. Halfway through I took mine off too and was shocked to find that often the picture looked better. Now I understand why James Cameron warned that post-production 3D conversions would harm the technology. Leterrier didnt ask to make a 3D film; it was thrust upon him just months ago when Warner Bros. realized it could make a few extra bucks but instead of the fullness of Avatar (and the nearly-superior How To Train Your Dragon) it looks like a shoebox diorama just a flat face in the foreground. Clash isnt a pox upon the multiplex but it wont replace the original in our hearts--which to be honest is better remembered than rewatched. But at least Leterrier set out to blaze his own immortal warpath. And when Ray Harryhausens mechanical owl pops up eager to guide Worthingtons journey this time a soldier growls ""Just leave it.""

But they still exude a sense of balletic action grace and painstaking detail an unlikely delicateness that Keaton or Chaplin might have admired. They contained wonderment - a tough commodity to conjure in the big loud action epics of today. Movie Information Clash of the TitansRatingShowtimes | Official site and trailerDirector Louis LeterrierActors Sam Worthington Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes Gemma Atherton Jason Flemyng and Alexa DavalosRun time 103 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (violence mild sexual content)Synopsis Sam Worthington (Avatar Terminator Salvation) stars in this 3-D remake.More movies from GuideLive.comThat brings us to the new Clash remake a competent slog that takes itself too seriously to have a whole lot of fun. The giant scorpions are bigger and badder; the dragon is a fine feat of movie technology; and Hades the underworld god with a chip on his shoulder comes and goes in a swirling cloud of black smoke (when hes not splitting himself into innumerable flying lizard creatures). In the end you feel as though you might as well be watching another Mummy sequel.You may know the story. The folks of Argos have made the gods on Mount Olympus really angry. (Why taunt the gods? I just dont see the percentages.) Hades (Ralph Fiennes) lays down an ultimatum Sacrifice Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) or face the wrath of the dragon Kracken. The foolish mortals only hope is Zeus half-human son Perseus (Sam Worthington jaw clenched) who must find a way to ahem get Kracken.Across the desert and mountains he goes aided by some of Argos finest to consult with witches (nasty little hags with one communal eye) battle some mega-scorpions face off with Medusa and ultimately fight the dragon whose emergence from the sea and sheer size are quite impressive. One wag of the tail and towering monuments are a crumblin. (Like seemingly every effects-laden movie these days Clash can also be seen in 3-D. The effect doesnt add much here but its recent ubiquity has me eagerly anticipating the 3-D version of Greenberg .)Director Louis Leterrier (The Incredible Hulk) and three screenwriters insert the occasional stab at humor at least once at the expense of the original movie and create a jocular tone between the men and their reluctant demigod leader. Fiennes and Liam Neeson who plays Zeus as a disappointed parent at the end of his tether have some fun with their stilted dialogue. None of them can keep Clash of the Titans from feeling rote an undercooked offering to the fanboy gods. This Clash of the Titans isnt bad.

"Clash of the Titans The gods must be crazy | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesClash of the Titans The gods must be crazyClash of the Titans the faux 3-D remake of the 1981 beards-and-bombast epic opens Friday. Peter Howell gives it 2.5 starsScowling Sam Worthington plays Perseus in The Clash of the Titans opening Friday April 2.  (Jay Maidment SMPSP / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 1 2010Clash of the Titans (out of four)Starring Sam Worthington Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes Mads Mikkelsen and Gemma Arterton. Directed by Louis Leterrier. At major theatres. 14ABe careful how you yell ""Argos""Thats my viewing tip for Torontonians sallying forth to watch Clash of the Titans the faux 3-D remake of the 1981 beards-and-bombast epic. It opens Friday.Article Continued BelowYoure supposed to pronounce the name of the ancient Greek city as something like ""Ar-gauze"" in keeping with the oh-so-serious tone of the committee-written screenplay.But T.O. citizens watching this unintentionally hilarious hash will be tempted to groan ""Argh-oohs"" at regular intervals as fans of the Toronto Argonauts football team are wont to do whenever their pigskin heroes disappoint them which is often.Trust me you dont need any further enticement to moan or snicker than whats already on offer from Clash of the Titans directed by Louis Leterrier (The Incredible Hulk). Its definitely in the so-bad-its-good category of blockbusters (hence my highly charitable ""good"" rating of 2 1/2 stars).Imagine the twee mysticism of The Lord of the Rings crossed with the sweaty male bonding of 300 blended with the contrarian posturings of Bewitched and you get the idea.On that last comparison Avatars Sam Worthington plays a half-man half-god hero named Perseus who is leading a human grudge match against the gods of Mt. Olympus disco-dressed Zeus (Liam Neeson) and his bilious brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes).Perseus could just summon up the godly side of his nature and take on the giant scorpions and other CGI creations hurled at him by Zeus Hades and Hollywood. But just like reluctant witch Samantha in Bewitched he obstinately refuses to act like a god other than as a last resort. We know hes a hero because hes the only guy without a beard and he gets his hair buzzed by the Marines.Perseus is steamed because his dad Zeus conceived him by doing the Rosemarys Baby thing raping and impregnating his mortal mom Danae who is played by Danish supermodel Tine Stapelfeldt (whom I would call a goddess but never mind).Dastardly divine acts like these have the humans so miffed at their immortal masters they topple their giant statue of Zeus into the ocean leaving only one colossal foot later to appear in innumerable Monty Python sketches.The clueless Zeus is stunned that the humans would be so naughty ""I created them and they reward my love with defiance?"" he thunders. Earth to Zeus Ask any parent of a teenager. Deal with it dude.Zeus allows his nutty bro Hades to have at the humans which hes wanted to do for eons and its up to Perseus and his many merry band of unshaven scruffs to get on the good foot and do the bad thing against the aforementioned scorpions.Team Human includes two Bond film alumni Casino Royales Mads Mikkelsen whose Draco character is considerably manlier than his blood-squirting Bond baddie; and Quantum of Solaces Gemma Arterton whose character Io a va-va-voom visionary also has eyes for Perseus.Ios role is actually the toughest in the film since she has to utter lines like these with an utterly straight face ""Perseus youre not just part man and part god youre the best of both""Show me a man who wouldnt want hear that and Ill show you Sam Worthington who seems to have acquired a permanent scowl. He wasnt in control of his body in Avatar but in Clash hes completely lost control of his senses because hed rather wrangle with digital creations in the dirt than swing with vestal virgins on a cloud up on Mt. Olympus.Hes also completely humorless. He doesnt smirk when three soothsaying witches with Lady Gaga bangs give him the hairy eyeball -- as in literally give him a giant hairy eyeball that they have swinging from a rope. Instead he tries to charm them possibly for a franchise spin-off to be titled Romancing the Crone.Perseus doesnt even get the one gag that directly riffs on the 1981 original Clash a reference to that films ridiculous mechanical owl which was not one of producer/animator Ray Harryhausens better ideas.Harryhausens stop-motion creations were so much a part of the appeal of the first Clash and its hard to top his earlier work.This reborn Clash certainly doesnt. But it does offer the sexiest Medusa ever seen -- or rather not seen unless you want to turn to stone. Shes a hottie even with that snake hairdo.Pity about the beheading part but thats nothing for this Clash which has more meat on spikes than there are lamb kebabs at Taste of the Danforth.Its one supremely silly movie but its also a Razzies-ready hoot especially when the gods get really mad at the rebellious humans and Zeus yells ""Release the Kraken"" a reference to the giant sea monster this movie thriftily shares with Pirates of the Caribbean.Turns out that the Kraken when we finally get a good look at it is just a giant snapping turtle with tentacles which makes it a lot less scary and a lot funnier than its supposed to be.So is that hilarious call of ""Release the Kraken"" which is destined to become a catch phrase. I propose that it be shouted at all screenings of films which have been shot in 2-D and then converted into 3-D as this one was.The process does nothing to improve the movie going experience and it only leaves your wallet lighter by a few more dollars.Repeat after me all ye gods and mortals ""Were mad as Hades and were not going to take it anymore Release the Kraken""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Though it became a reasonable hit when released in 1981--and a served as a whole generations first taste of classical mythology thanks to incessant cable airings--Clash Of The Titans was also the end of the line for a certain kind of big-screen fantasy. Stop-motion wizard Ray Harryhausen whod been bringing fantastic beasts to life since Mighty Joe Young in 1949 made it his valedictory effort ceding special effects extravaganzas to new kids like Steven Spielberg and sailing off to a retirement hes still enjoying today. While calling the original Clash a great movie would be a stretch its still pretty charming and filled with Harryhausens lovingly handcrafted special effects from the towering Kraken to a clockwork owl. The latter makes an appearance in this remake only to be tossed aside with a scoff by one of the heroes which says pretty much all that needs to be said about director Louis Leterriers muscled-up revamp. Never mind the whimsy Lets get to the clanking swords. Sam Worthington plays Perseus the demigod son of Zeus (Neeson) who finds himself stuck in the middle of an ill-advised war between gods and men. (Note to humanity Its best not to take on foes capable of smiting you with thunderbolts.) Hoping to save a princess from being devoured by a sea monster he sets out on a quest that takes him to the underworld and back and which occasionally takes the film to an Apple Store-white Mt. Olympus where Neeson and Ralph Fiennes (as Hades) attempt to overact one another. Its a generally more entertaining contest than the action on the ground. Which isnt to say the new Clash isnt modestly entertaining by the low standards of spring blockbusters. As with Transporter 2 and The Incredible Hulk Leterrier aims no higher than competence and achieves just that shepherding a series of slick CGI creations across the screen to the accompaniment of an organ-rattling sound design. Hes a professional seat-filler as is Worthington who again proves--after Avatar and Terminator Salvation--that charisma isnt always a prerequisite for movie stardom. Together they get the job done efficiently and with minimal personality. If Clash were a meal it would come in a paper bag and have some grease stains near the bottom.

ABOUT THE MOVIEClash of the Titans 1/2 (out of four) Stars Sam Worthington Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes Gemma ArtertonDirector Louis LetterierDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13Running time 1 hour 46 minutesOpens in some theaters at midnight and nationwide Friday By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Theres nothing worse than a boring behemoth. UPDATING CLASH Remake revisits gods and monsters TRAILER Release the Kraken on your screen In Clash of the Titans the immortals on Mount Olympus threaten to dispatch a gargantuan creature known as a Kraken when mortal soldiers declare war on them. Humans quake in their sandals at the thought of encountering such a beast. But when the rampaging fiend finally appears its a big yawn -- much like the rest of the film. This wannabe epic is overwrought and frenetic but not even sporadically exciting. Its most astounding achievement is the ability to be both chaotic and dull. Because the action sequences are so frantic special effects look muddled. Despite state-of-the-art CG the film is no improvement over the 1981 original with its memorable stop-motion effects by Ray Harryhausen. Those who endure this remake will be bombarded by references to the dreaded Kraken. ""The Kraken is the end of us"" one mortal moans. ""You were born to kill the Kraken"" proclaims Io (Gemma Arterton) a guardian angel to heroic Perseus (Avatars Sam Worthington). ""Release the Kraken"" Zeus orders. And in case we missed it a ragged man shrieks ""The Kraken comes now"" The story of Perseus the son of Zeus and a human mother is a well-worn tale. He undertakes a perilous quest to stop Hades god of the underworld from overtaking the city of Argos. He must battle the venomous Medusa and the fearsome Kraken and save Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). Along the way he rides on winged Pegasus. Less than two months ago the family movie Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief fused this saga with a contemporary humor. Though aimed at younger audiences Percy was more entertaining thanks to its cheeky wit. Clash of the Titans is virtually humor-free. Claps of thunder are only a jot more subtle than the bombastic musical score and the dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. Liam Neeson plays white-haired Zeus with gleaming robes that look Vegas cheesy. Worst among the gods is Hades hammed up by Ralph Fiennes. Menacingly hissing his lines Fiennes seems to think hes still on the Harry Potter set playing Voldemort. Medusas head of writhing snakes is perhaps the best effect in a production that was filmed in 2-D but to capitalize on the latest screen fad was converted to 3-D. But overall its a colossal waste of time. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Thats the principal twist inserted into the new ""Clash of the Titans"" a remake of the sometimes fondly recalled technologically dated 1981 film about the fury of the gods of Mount Olympus and the rise of the young earthly demigod Perseus. This time Perseus (Sam Worthington) bears a distaste for his godlike nature He just wants to be a regular dude and do normal guy stuff -- like ride his winged horse Pegasus on the beach. Its perhaps a fitting updating of the film for an era marked by distrust for political leaders and Internet-empowered masses. Now even the gods are spurned in their own movie Deity is so out. On Mount Olympus that golden round table in the clouds Zeus (Liam Neeson in the part played by Laurence Olivier in the original) is angry at an ungrateful mankind and lets loose his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) to destroy the city of Argos. As a new citizen of Argos Perseus (the son of Zeus) doesnt much like this. He embarks on the familiar journey (particularly familiar for those who saw the recent bouncier teen version ""Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians"") in defeating a number of mythical creatures including a serpentine Medusa and the sea monster Kraken -- which rest assured is eventually released. 3-D? What 3-D? Directed by Louis Leterrier (2008s ""The Incredible Hulk"") ""The Clash of the Titans"" will likely lure moviegoers chiefly by its digital effects (which are largely quite good but forgettable) and its promise of 3-D spectacle (which disappoints altogether). Advertise Advertise Advertise Video Clash of the Titans Like several blockbusters being released now in the post-""Avatar"" environment ""Clash of the Titans"" was made in 2-D but converted to 3-D in post-production. Audiences will hardly notice any increased depth. Though this is preferable to the distraction of most 3-D its surely not worth the hike in ticket price. Worthington the Australian actor who stared in ""Avatar"" knows a little something about 3-D. Here he trades aqua blue-colored skin for an equally artificial bronze spray tan in the mold of ""300"" torsos. Worthington was largely eclipsed by the surrounding effects of ""Avatar""; its an interesting irony that few would be able to name the star of the biggest box-office grosser of all-time. In ""Titans"" his presence is more explicit but also less substantial. With a crew cut atop his almost perfectly spherical head Worthington grits his way through the film and does plenty of dramatic leaping while brandishing a sword. But he doesnt supply the charisma that the movie needs and the whole thing feels like a joyless slog. Fienness appearances provide a jolt. Arriving always with his head curiously fixed within a cloud of swirling black smog he knows how to make an entrance. His part is surely the best in the movie and hes clearly having fun. He hisses in a horse whisper ""What could be more beautiful than death?"" But thats not nearly enough to engender the kind of fondness people feel for the original ""Clash of the Titans"" campy though it is. Copyright 2010 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"Clash of the Titans movie review The gods must be cringing at this remake |       NJ.com comments Clash of the Titans movie review The gods must be cringing at this remake Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 01 2010 at 417 AM View/Post Comments Jay Maidment Sam Worthington as a harded Perseus recycles his Navi warrior grimace from ""Avatar."" Only the blue makeup is missing. Sing Muse Sing of the age when kings lived in the wood of holly and made pictures move upon the walls and with their gold bought marble pools and seaside villas and concubines named Tiffani with two Is. For it was in that time that the tale of the ""Clash of the Titans"" was told again. Clash of the Titans (PG-13) Warner Bros. (106 min.) Directed by Louis Leterrier. With Sam  Worthington Ralph Fiennes Liam Neeson.  Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating One and a half stars Rating note The film contains much ungodly violence. And this was not the song that Ray of Harryhausen had sung before made for lyre and magic and Harry of Hamlin and Ursula of Undress. For the time for that song had passed -- or so thought the kings of this age of folly. And the gods took notice. But no the mortals decreed this was an epic made for Sam of Worthington and Ralph of Fiennes and Liam of Pay Me Now. And it would be full of tricks made by machine and talk made by fools and pictures of three dimensions that seemed merely like the View-Masters of old. And it did make the gods angry. For lo what they saw at the special sneak preview was a mockery. For long before his Perseus even confronted the Medusa the thespian Sam already seemed made of stone and only gave rise to the hope in many breasts that he once again be painted blue. And though the Hades that Ralph did play whispered like a serpent and displayed the posture of a hunchback these were ancient tricks seen before most often in the stories of Hogwarts. And the questing Zeus of Liam seemed in search only of his check. And so the true gods did leave Olympus and look for vengeance. For this plot did desecrate their memories and dilute the ancient myths like cheap wine bringing in the djinns of Arabia and the sea serpents of the Norsemen and a painted mystic from Burning Man. And these effects were full of slime and cheap outsourcing and the much-heralded third dimension blurred the vision giving every character the heads of hydras and citizens in the amphitheater the pain of migraines. And the gods did come to earth to lay waste to the picture-makers. But lo Apollo did spy a comely lad in the west of the wood of holly and did lay aside his wrath and woo him with sweet songs. And the two now run a bed-and-breakfast that does a very nice brunch. And on her way to the multiplex Hera did see her weary countenance in a looking glass and was shamed to see she wore a mom toga. And now she does Pilates and spinning and Atkins and her pool boy. And abandoned by the gods Zeus did rage and seek out the brothers Warner with his mighty lightning bolt. But the sirens sang to him and offered a very sweet two-picture deal with profit participation. So sing oh Muse And pray for a long drink at the waters of forgetfulness. Or at least a beer and a DVD of ""Jason and the Argonauts.""

But now for the first time a film arrives for which the 3D element may prove to be a commercial hindrance. Its not only that Clash of the Titans will compete with Alice in Wonderland How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar for the nations 3D screens. More critically than that the films conversion to 3D (a decision taken late in the filmmaking process) has rendered this campy unashamedly old-school but still highly enjoyable blockbuster rather painful to watch.In story terms Clash of the Titans doesnt stray too far from the beloved 1981 Ray Harryhausen classic which spawned it. The setting is mythical Ancient Greece - an age of Gods monsters and muscular men in little chainmail skirts. Sam Worthington is Perseus an orphaned demi-God drawn into the battle between man and the immortals when Hades (Ralph Fiennes) lord of the underworld threatens to unleash his great sea-beast the Kraken on the city of Argos. Accompanied by a ragtag band of warriors Perseus sets off to learn the secrets of the Kraken and end the reign of the Gods once and for all.Theres no ignoring the fact that Clash of the Titans is a mess the plot is episodic and rushed the dialogue blunt and occasionally laughable and there are far too many characters few of whom leave much of an impression. Both Worthington and love interest Gemma Arterton look like theyre on a strenuous Aegean package holiday but luckily theyre surrounded by the likes of Fiennes Pete Postlethwaite and Liam Neeson as Zeus whose commanding armour-clad presence seems at times to be the only thing holding this crumbling edifice together.Other notable names dont fare so well Danny Huston gets a mighty fake beard but just one line as sea-God Poseidon Mads Mikkelsen does little more than bare his teeth as burly swordsman Draco and most egregiously Jason Flemyng gets a terrific backstory and some superb melting-face makeup as ruined ruler Calibos - and thats it. Its is a recurring problem throughout the film with dialogue and character motivation cut back to the bare minimum theres no way for anyone to express themselves except through action.But luckily this is where Clash of the Titans succeeds. Whatever the flaws in the script theres no faulting director Louis Leterriers visual ambition this is a film of mighty vistas beautifully designed beasts and intense well-structured combat sequences all rendered in eye-popping though still rather fake-looking CGI. Taking the lessons of The Lord of the Rings to heart Leterrier goes all-out for excess his computer-generated camera soars above sprawling cities endless deserts and blasted underworld hellscapes lending the film a dizzying epic scale.A shame then that the addition of 3D has rendered much of this grandeur all but unwatchable blurring the image to a headache-inducing degree and adding absolutely nothing to a film which was obviously shot in two dimensions and should have stayed that way. As an experiment in high-Hollywood style over substance Clash of the Titans is a very entertaining ride. But take our advice sidestep the 3D and see it the old fashioned way.

The story was so different from Greek Mythology Like in the film Acricius was the husband of Danae Perseus mother. However in mythology Acricious was Danaes father. And at the end of the film Andromeda didnt get to marry Perseus when in Mythology he did. Anyway the movie effects were great. Its very fast paced makes your heart beat faster.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 11 2010RCOGFeaturedTook my young cousins lads both to see this and it occured to me that I was around their age when the original Oliver ""Clash"" came out in the Eighties. They enjoyed it tremendously and what the Hades so did I. In fairness to Director Louis Leterrier he paces and moves the story along with a lot more urgency than most established practicioners of the genre the biggest problem is Worthington who never sells it. Still theres Neeson and Fiennes having fun hamming it up and Lads on mid term or of middle age could do worse than Gemma Arterton as Io and Alexa Davalos as Andromeda.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 11 2010AliFeaturedRubbishFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 11 2010sarwar ahmedFeaturedVery very cool.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 5 2010Thomas NoctorFeaturedAndy just because I dont like this film doesnt mean to say I hate all films.

Like I say Sam Worthington cant work out who he is in this movie - and whether English Yank or Aussie. The (lack of) continuitys bad. And yes Gemma Artertons as much at fault for her characters depth - I think the idea is you read the script before signing up to a movie. A 1 star movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 5 2010laurenFeaturedI agree with most of what Tom Huddleston says athough I disagree in his assessment of Ralph Fiennes being better than Sam Worthington- Fiennes seemed to invest in the funny voice and CGI a little too much to sell his character. The female characters were essentially useless which was disapointing- Io was okay except for her lack of depth (scripts fault not Gemma Artertons). The CGI was decent although I dont think the 3D adds anything (perhaps they shouldve invested more time and money into making the script a bit less 2D instead). The story line was so-so although visually it was a pretty good-looking film. It was refreshing to see a lead Australian allowed to use his natural accent and not an RP or American as is ususually the case in these films (I mention this because Dicky references it as a bad mix of UK/US and Aussie- sorry Dicky but youve obviously never heard an Australian talk before...). Overall yeah it was fun but Im not going to bother buying it on DVD. Next time I want a 3D epic hit Im going back to see Avatar.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 4 2010DickyFeaturedThis is a desperately bad movie. Ignore TOaEUR(tm)s rating aEUR"" itaEUR(tm)s way too generous as pretty much everyone else (below) seems to agree. This film is barely worth 1 star. Unimaginative script bad wigs bad make-up bad CGI bad accents (WorthingtonaEUR(tm)s varies between well spoken English New Yorker and broad Aussie) and very dodgy CGI. At one point one of the soldiers waves a hand and tells Sam Worthington what heaEUR(tm)s seeing is Argos. I wondered if that meant the town in question was cheap and cheerful and looked as thought it came from a catalogue or whether he was talking about the original Greek town of Argos.

This Clash provides frequent occasion for awe as Perseus and company men in rebellion against the tyranny of Olympus embark on a tour of hodgepodge theme-park antiquity rendered in button-by-button detail I especially liked the warped ferry to Hades with oarsman Charon replaced by an outboard motor. Transporter director Louis Leterrier is sure-footed when battling Gorgons and giant scorpions but he muddles the comic-grotesque opportunity of the Stygian Witches. His shopworn ""hearty camaraderie"" scenes and LOTR helicopter sweeps over exotic terrain dont do much to sway one to the cause of humanity and the hasty romance will make no heart palpitate. Its not surprising to learn that Clash was converted to 3-D as an afterthought; nothing onscreen justifies wearing dumb glasses -- until a certifiably stunning climax which has you barnstorming on the back of Pegasus above and through the streets of a Kraken-besieged city. (Nick Pinkerton) (Citywide) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - DON MCKAY A strange largely inert indie thriller Don McKay has good bones (inspired by Blood Simple it has a solid cast and a strong pitch) but a terrible metabolism. Rigorously oblique in form and content the writing and directing debut of Jake Goldberger follows the trials of the downtrodden title character played by Thomas Haden Church as he is pulled back to his hometown after 25 years. Don is summoned by his high school sweetheart Sonny (Elisabeth Shue) who has made their reunion and marriage her dying wish but from the cackling cabdriver who drops him off to Sonnys imperious nurse (Melissa Leo barely recognizable and loving it) and reptilian doctor (James Rebhorn) Goldberger works hard to communicate that something is really off. Playing a janitor who has spent his adult life pining for Sonny Church wears a look of dazed consternation throughout and the wonky camera angles and non sequitur exchanges compound what becomes a tiresome impenetrability. There are moments of fine comic blackness -- a body count begun early on is played for Coen-esque jollies and Shues flaky femme fatale has her moments -- but the energetic revelation of the finale is too much of a relief for Don McKay to deliver it as a reward. (Michelle Orange) (AMC Burbank Sunset 5)THE GREATEST Hours after losing his virginity to Rose (Carey Mulligan) his dream girl 18-year-old Bennett Brewer (Aaron Johnson) dies in a horrific car crash. Three months later Rose knocks at the Brewer familys front door pregnant with Bennetts baby and in need of a home. Allen Brewer (Pierce Brosnan) a mathematics professor welcomes her but his angry and withdrawn wife Grace (Susan Sarandon) does not. First-time writer-director Shana Feste has made an uneven but often affecting film that requires its gifted cast to push hard against the scripts schematic plotting to find moments of real emotion. A series of flashbacks to Bennett and Roses courtship contains few words but is rich in nuance and feeling thanks to the quivering intensity of Johnson and Mulligans chemistry while a late-film confession by Bennetts younger teen brother beautifully played by Johnny Simmons provides the films emotional highlight. Clearly Feste can write young people but she has zero insight into married adults. A brave actor if not a technically dazzling one Brosnan gives a moving performance but hes constantly undercut by the predictability of Allens woes and sad to say by the overly familiar tics of Sarandon a sometimes great actor who seems these days to always play a grieving mother. Move on Ms. Sarandon. Please. (Chuck Wilson) (ArcLight)TYLER PERRYS WHY DID I GET MARRIED TOO? was not screened in advance of our publication deadline but a review will appear here next week. (Citywide)GO  WARLORDS No less a man than Jet Li cries multiple times in The Warlords an impressively gargantuan Chinese battle epic that generously accommodates director Peter Chans proven talent for jerking tears (e.g. Comrades Almost a Love Story). A quasi-remake of the Shaw bros. 1973 hit The Blood Brothers Chans gory meller follows the tender bonding and tragic split of a trio of 19th-century bandits turned warlords. Yes a ""beautiful courtesan"" (Xu Jinglei) is partly to blame. She nurses Lis battle-scarred General Pang back to health with soup and batted eyes despite being married to Er-Hu (Andy Lau) a gang leader who along with sidekick Wu-Yang (Takeshi Kaneshiro) makes an ill-fated blood pact with Pang. An early bullets-versus-arrows skirmish stretches to almost half an hour climaxing with a rather wicked decapitation. Then power-hungry conqueror Pang building an army of starving heroes begins to set his sights on Suzhou City and Nanking Chans old-fashioned highly watchable megaproduction comes complete with Gods-eye surveys of mass carnage the moist sounds of sword-skewering and little or no discernible CGI. Pushing two hours (whereas the Chinese version runs slightly longer) the damn thing finally ends with a helluva knife fight -- in the pouring rain yet. Or are those heavens tears?

Posted April 1 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT These days it seems that whenever someone in Hollywood decides to remake a classic movie (like you know The Hitcher or Rollerball) it cant be called a remake. It has to be a ""reimagining"" that renders the new version a totally different animal. If ever there was a movie that cried out for a reimagining its Clash of the Titans the 1981 gods-and-monsters spectacle of mythological B-movie kitsch. It had a slapped-together story line (think The Odyssey meets Hercules vs. the Moloch) that turned the denizens of Mount Olympus into ersatz Star Wars elders; shameless paycheck acting from the ancient Laurence Olivier; a leading man (Harry Hamlin) who was all hunk and no talent; and special effects by the 60s stop-motion wizard Ray Harryhausen that -- well to call them primitive would be kind though the herky-jerky invention of Harryhausens creations did lend the movie a quaintly entertaining magic-shop charm. Thirty years later I recall Clash of the Titans with a certain trashy fondness. I did assume however that the creators of the new version would throw out everything but the generic antiquity setting and Medusa. But no Bravely they have not reimagined Clash of the Titans -- they have remade it with 3-D added after the movie was filmed (translation There isnt a single good ""Wow"" of a 3-D shot in the entire picture). Its not just the story in all its Olympian garishness thats more or less the same. The special effects while mostly digital have been intentionally crafted to conjure some of that old-school analog delight. At one point a tribe of scorpions emerges from the desert and you can swear that the close-ups of their spindly limbs are giant scale models. Its a sweet retro touch. The new Clash isnt a cynical rehash. It has the flavor of a certain pre-CGI innocence. If only it had a zestier hero Perseus played by Avatars Sam Worthington is a Hercules/Christ figure a half-man/half-god (unbeknownst to him hes the son of Zeus) who leads a tribe of soldiers in revolt against the gods. To do so he must seize the greatness within himself but Worthington shows less personality than Harry Hamlin did. He looks smashing in his Russell Crowe gladiator haircut but unlike Crowe hes volatile without any gravitas. When he has to show fury its token ""fury"" -- fiery resolve on antidepressants. Hes like a handsome statue thats still coming to life. As Zeus Liam Neeson twinkles where Laurence Olivier kvetched and Ralph Fiennes as Zeus dark brother Hades (who has egged on the revolt to challenge Zeus) has a slinky nastiness. In a movie like Clash of the Titans -- a trash-compacted mash-up of other better movies -- about all you can really do is sit back enjoy the expert hamming of pros like these and wait for the cheeseball F/X wonder. Medusa with her angry snake tresses is still a thriller and the Kraken the supersize creature unleashed at the films climax conjures a bit of that old tacky matinee-movie awe. He may not be a reimagining of anything but hell do.

Its a big hunk of feta comin at ya in 3-D -- that is if you subject yourself to this mythical-gods silliness in the stereoscopic format available in many theaters. More about Clash of the Titans >> (A note about that dont bother. Unlike Avatar Clash of the Titans was 3-D-ized on the cheap; its a low-end conversion that essentially gives the actors and CG- computer-generated monsters a dimensional shadow. Theres nothing particularly impressive about it.) A remake of the even-cheesier 1981 Clash with Harry Hamlin and the great stop-motion monsters of Ray Harryhausen French action maestro Louis Leterriers Olympian endeavor assembles Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes Avatars Sam Worthington (Perseus with an Aussie accent) and scores of British thespians and Eurobabes to tell the tale of a war between gods and men. Its an epic conflagration that pits the restless rabble against a clique of ethically challenged deities who dont know what to do with all their free time. Like a good Bible story Clash of the Titans begins with a voice-over telling us that ""into this world a child was born."" And behold the little demigod Perseus found in a floating sarcophagus by a humble fisherman (Pete Postlethwaite) and his wife (Elizabeth McGovern). The couple raise him as their own teach him how to fish and then when he grows into a strapping bloke (with an Aussie accent) the familys boat is sent to the bottom of the sea in a raging storm of demons unleashed by Hades god of the underworld. Mom and Dad drown but Perseus survives embarking on a quest to end Hades reign of terror and teach that smug Zeus -- Perseus biological father -- a thing or two. Zeus and Hades dont get along a fact that has much to do with ego temperament and celestial allegiances but also because the two bearded and bewigged gents playing the gods -- Neeson as Zeus Fiennes as Hades -- cant agree on how to pronounce Kraken. The Kraken of course is the ""colossal and elemental beast"" and ""the unspeakable horror"" unleashed from the oceans depths to mess with peoples heads and homes and cities. Neeson of Irish origin prefers craaack-en; Fiennes English to the core says krah-kin. Let the battle begin. Clash of the Titans does a nice job giving the giant mythical creatures -- blood scorpions sea snakes the winged black horse Pegasus -- a retro-fantasy feel even if they were digitally rendered. Medusa whom Perseus must slay if he is to send Hades back to the underground is essentially a giant CG serpent sporting a black brassiere and the head of a fetching Russian supermodel (Natalia Vodianova). Her coif a dreadlock-y mess of snakes. Gemma Arterton the Bond girl is Io Perseus bare-shouldered guardian angel. Alexa Davados is Andromeda who when things get bad is tethered to a sacrificial altar. She dangles over the Argos bay for hours hanging by her arms. (Hence the Andromeda strain?) There are many obstacles along Perseus path three Stygian witches with one eye among them; the river Styx; the aforementioned scorpions; and ultimately the half-snake half-cover girl Medusa who turns you to stone if you make the mistake of looking at her. So try not to. Especially with those 3-D glasses. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Clash of the Titans | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; clash-of-the-titans_2049 ) Clash of the Titans (United Kingdom/United States 2010) March 30 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Seen in standard digital 3D. To employ a clichA(c) theres good news and bad news for Clash of the Titans fans. The good news is that the 2010 remake is an improvement upon the 1981 original. The bad news is that the degree of improvement is minor and much of whats enhanced about this interpretation of Greek mythology is undone by some of the worst 3D rendering since circular polarization replaced the old red lens/blue lens approach. Anyone interested in seeing Clash of the Titans is recommended to seek out the 2D experience - not only is it less expensive but it will permit enjoyment of the story without distractions that include but are not limited to motion blur during action sequences perpetual dimness and headaches/nausea. The 3D looks bad; for the most part its 2D in different planes - an effect which makes everything appear unconvincing and is as compelling an argument as one can find for why this sort of ""quickie"" conversion should not be foisted upon audiences. Clash of the Titans can best be described as a re-imagination of the 1981 movie which was in turn a re-telling of the legend of Perseus. The 2010 version focuses on the half-god/half-mortal hero (played by Sam Worthington) but also explores the politics of Mount Olympus with Hades (Ralph Fiennes) plotting against his brother Zeus (Liam Neeson). The gods have become annoyed that men are failing to show them proper respect. As a form of punishment Hades has issued an ultimatum to the citizens of Argos sacrifice their princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) or hell unleash the full fury of the monstrous Kraken upon the land. Perseus who bears a grudge against Hades related to the death of his adopted father (Pete Posthethwaite) assembles a group of men and one woman. He has ten days to discover the means by which the Kraken can be defeated before Andromedas life is forfeit. Many of the memorable elements of the original have been carried forward to this re-make including a fight against supersized scorpions the battle to claim Medusas head a romance between Perseus and a female companion (in this case its Io played by Gemma Arterton instead of Andromeda) and the manner in which the climactic struggle is resolved. The creature Calibos is present but he is no longer a centaur. The mechanical owl Bubo sometimes referred to as the Jar-Jar Binks of the original Clash of the Titans makes a cameo appearance. Pegasus is here although he has undergone a color change. Improved special effects less cheesy dialogue and a reduction in inappropriate humor allow the 2010 Clash of the Titans to be taken more seriously than the 1981 version but improbabilities in the story occasionally make it difficult to swallow whats being spoon-fed. Even a fantasy adventure needs to apply some level of internal logic and thats not always the case here. (Hades master plan for example - which is new to this incarnation - does not bear up to even cursory examination.) The monsters are represented effectively in CGI - they lack the signature appearance of the painstaking Ray Harryhausen stop-motion animation that characterized the first one but they are state-of-the-art and as believable as one might expect for giant sea monsters and serpentine women with snakes for hair. The 1981 Clash of the Titans was a mix of the good and the bad when it came to special effects. This one is less open to criticism on that level. And although Olympus doesnt dazzle with its spectacle the Underworld is impressively realized. The scenes in which the characters approach Medusas lair aboard Charons ferry are among Clash of the Titans most evocative. When it comes to the characters thats where the movies Achilles heel becomes apparent there arent any or at least none that attain even a semblance of three-dimensionality. Okay no one goes to something called Clash of the Titans with the expectation of meaningful drama or deep introspection but would it be too much to ask that the lead character have a personality? Sam Worthington has become the go-to actor for big budget spectacles - this is his third in less than a year (following Terminator Salvation and Avatar) - and he continues to show as much range as the special effects with which he is surrounded. To say there is no chemistry between Worthington and Gemma Arterton (Strawberry Fields in Quantum of Solace) is to state the obvious because director Louis Leterrier obviously doesnt care about the films love story. (Its so underdeveloped that one wonders why he doesnt dispense with it altogether.) An expectation that the presence of acting giants like Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes might elevate the quality of performances proves to be unfounded. Like Lawrence Olivier in the original they play down to the material rather than having it rise to their level. Clash of the Titans is perhaps the first major 3D movie to be aimed squarely at teenage boys. Its hard to imagine this movie capturing a wider audience although there will undoubtedly be viewers who attend the production for its nostalgia value. The film offers a no-frills approach to fantasy/adventure providing monsters mayhem and violence aplenty with just enough restraint not to overstep the bounds of the PG-13 rating. Those who see Clash of the Titans in 2D might argue that it harkens back to some of the classic B-movie fantastical adventures that were popular during the middle decades of the 20th century. Those who see it in 3D may be so exasperated by the visual clutter that they wont be as kindly disposed. Clash of the Titans is a flawed but mildly entertaining regurgitation of Greek mythological elements but its also an example of how poorly executed 3D can hamstring a would-be spectacle.

Clash of the Titans Director Louis Leterrier. Cast Sam Worthingon Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes. Rating Rated PG-13 for fantasy action violence some frightening images and brief sensuality. RELATED Harry Hamlin fondly recalls original Clash Avatar star Sam Worthington goes Greek Swords and sandals Spotlight Liam Neeson Lets throw that stupid idea out the window right here at the start shall we? Its impossible to talk about the new version of ""Clash of the Titans"" without keeping the 1981 original firmly in mind. Comparisons are inevitable and theyre not going to be especially kind. Its not as if the first one was ""Citizen Kane"" or anything but what it lacked in oh plot and acting it made up for with an undeniable charm. Theres a reason its still a cult favorite. Charm alas is the one thing lost in all the banging and clanging of the remake. Director Louis Leterrier has all the tricks of the trade - including an odd sort of 3-D that serves mostly to blur images in the background - at his disposal as did special-effects legend Ray Harryhausen in the original. (Well all the tricks that stop-motion animated offered anyway.) Yet while Harryhausen used the rather goofy device to enhance the story Leterrier just cant help himself. Nothing is enough. The battle scenes are so manic and harried that its impossible to tell whos winning (unless the enemy is say a giant scorpion and even then things are muddled). The chance to utter the immortal line ""Release the Kraken"" was probably enough for Liam Neeson to sign on as Zeus. That and a fat paycheck. But once the Kraken finally arrives hes so enormous so ridiculously over the top in terms of scale and ferocity that we lose all sense of context. Hes just a big giant . . . thing with sharp teeth and we dont see those for several minutes. Thats a lot of build up for not much payoff. The first film took liberties with Greek mythology; this one does as well. Perseus (Sam Worthington following up ""Avatar"" with this making one wonder if well ever see him in 2-D again) is cast into the sea as an infant and saved. This time however hes not on a solo quest to win the hand of Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). Instead he finds himself in the middle of a war between man and the gods not realizing that he is the son of Zeus and a mortal mother. He learns soon enough. The gods are offended by the growing independence of man and especially by the claim from Cassiopeia (Polly Walker) that man has indeed replaced the gods. Up pops Hades (Ralph Fiennes) all fire and brimstone; evidently living in the underworld has given him a mean case of laryngitis. He will have the Kraken destroy Argos and everyone in it unless Andromeda is sacrificed. Unhappy at learning of his lineage Perseus signs on to try to save the city and Andromeda. Hes accompanied on his quest by soldiers and the beautiful Io (Gemma Arterton). Determined to succeed as a man and not as a god he rejects the gifts his father offers and has no interest in becoming a ruler. For the most part it seems as if hed be happiest to the extent that hes happy at all just to go fishing. The story again features a showdown with Medusa the hideous Gorgon with snake hair who turns men to stone when they look into her eyes. While the effects are arguably better - certainly more realistic - than in the original the scene like most of the others involving action is too harried to be anywhere near as effective. There is one funny reference to the original involving the ridiculous mechanical owl that was an obvious nod to R2D2 in ""Star Wars"" though it passes quickly so be ready. Silly though that owl was at least it fit the spirit of the original. So tone deaf to the material is Leterrier that the spirit of the remake owes more to ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" than a sword-and-sandal film. Bigger louder more expensive? All that for sure. But better? Not by a long shot. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

Even more haphazardly plotted than the original ""Clash of the Titans"" boasts 3D imagery and kinetic action that cant obscure a movie that is finally pretty flat. Influenced almost as much by ""The Lord of the Rings"" as a 1981 namesake most notable for Ray Harryhausens stop-motion effects the technical upgrade doesnt improve the clunky mythological underpinnings while the script ratchets up the man-vs.-the-gods quotient. Result feels mostly like a (very expensive) kids pic and international prospects appear more promising than domestic box office which after a muscular opening -- with apologies to the gods -- should be somewhat less than titanic. Theres always the risk of a camp factor when dealing with the denizens of Mt. Olympus sword-and-sandal derring-do and earnest utterances like ""Release the Kraken"" -- which in some respects is part of the films charm. Its just that as directed by Louis Letterier (""The Incredible Hulk"") from an adaptation credited to a trio of writers ""Titans"" is both dark and busy visually and nearly devoid of humor. Indeed the one memorable laugh a fleeting reference to the first movies idiotic mechanical owl will likely fly over much of the target audiences heads. An introductory sequence finds Perseus (played as an adult by Sam Worthington looking buff but not blue fresh off ""Avatar"") the bastard child of Zeus being rescued and raised by a kindly fisherman (Pete Postlethwaite). Alas their happy existence is disrupted by the angry lord of the underworld Hades (Ralph Fiennes) who convinces his brother Zeus (Liam Neeson) that they must punish the city of Argos for daring to disrespect the gods. ""A new era has begun The era of man"" the king proclaims which does not sit well among the Olympians triggering the decision to release a massive beast the Kraken to lay waste to Argos unless the king agrees to sacrifice his daughter Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). So Perseus embarks on a quest to save the girl one that includes tractor-trailer-sized scorpions oracular witches and an inevitable showdown with Medusa whose gaze turns men to stone. That scene -- easily the most effective in the Harryhausen version -- is more chaotic but considerably less impressive here. There are a few new wrinkles to the story the main ones being the gods heightened malevolence and Perseus disdain for his immortal heritage -- prompting him to resist using his demigod-given gifts among them a magic sword. That defiant near-pigheaded attitude comes despite prodding from two Bond alumni Draco (Mads Mikkelsen) a steely soldier accompanying him; and Io (Gemma Arterton) his beautiful guide. Other than Mikkelsen alas the cast is largely wrestled into submission by the stilted dialogue. Fiennes in particular hisses most of his -- looking and sounding a bit too much like a bearded Voldemort. As for the action everything is literally bigger but not necessarily better including the gigantic Kraken which now resembles ""Return of the Jedis"" Rancor monster but remains every bit as anticlimactic as it was three decades ago. Technically in fact the effects are too frequently muddied by the pace at which they flash by limiting opportunities to appreciate the combined animatronic computer-generated and motion-capture visuals. The most satisfying creative element actually is Ramin Djawadis operatic score. Given the mythological nature of the violence were the movie a bit less dark it actually could have been pitched more to ""PG"" territory than to young adults inasmuch as theres limited bloodletting and scant mushy romance to distract from the adventure. Once state-of-the-art Harryhausens work is surely dated from a technical standpoint compared with the magic CGI can conjure; still this ""Titans"" reboot merely demonstrates that building a more elaborate mousetrap doesnt necessarily produce a more entertaining one.
