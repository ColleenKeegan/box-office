To be sure its a solid respectable work one that will interest a sizeable number of viewers internationally due to both the subject matter and the man who made it. The young Roman Polanski spent World War II hiding from the Nazis in Poland but coming from a child of the Holocaust ""The Pianist"" plays as a remarkably conventional film. To be sure its a solid respectable work one that will interest a sizeable number of viewers internationally due to both the subject matter and the man who made it. Still this sober account of a talented Jewish musician who managed to survive in Warsaw throughout five years of German occupation surprisingly lacks a feeling of personal urgency and insight that would have made it a distinctive even unique contribution to the considerable number of films that deal with the war in general and Holocaust in particular. As happened with Polanskis ""Tess"" 23 years ago there is the possibility that a motivated distributor could muscle the picture far enough into prestige territory -- where the film has had the good fortune to begin its public life thanks to its Palme dOr in Cannes -- to make Polanskis ""comeback"" a decent B.O. attraction. Not wanting to make a strictly autobiographical picture about his boyhood traumas and adventures Polanski long searched for the proper vehicle with which to merge his own memories of the rape of Poland. He found it in ""The Pianist"" a survival memoir by Wladyslaw Szpilman who was a well-known composer and musician for Polish radio before the war and not quite 30 when the Nazis invaded in 1939. Szpilman wrote his book in 1945 and it was published the following year as ""Death of a City"" but the tome was soon banned by the communist authorities for showing that there were good and bad people alike among the Poles and Jews and even the Germans one of whom had helped Szpilman avoid detection at a crucial late stage of the war. Under its new title the book was finally republished to great success in 1998 two years before the authors death. Szpilmans book is notable for its unstressed dispassionate description of horrific events and the approach of Polanski and writer Ronald Harwood (""The Dresser"") is similarly watchful and unmelodramatic -- to the point however of draining most of the tension and emotion out of the storys many precarious situations. The film has its moments of bleak power but only occasionally are the incidents of mans inhumanity to man shocking unfamiliar or dramatically fresh. First-hand aspect is felt at the outset as Wladyslaw (Adrien Brody) is in the middle of a radio piano performance when a blast from a German bomb explodes through the studio. Like everyone else in Warsaw the Szpilmans know whats coming but they are convinced that everything will be fine once England and France declare war on Hitler. The upper-class family which includes Wladyslaws father (Frank Finlay) mother (Maureen Lipman) brother Henryk (Ed Stoppard) and sisters Halina (Jessica Kate Meyer) and Regina (Julia Rayner) has a well-appointed apartment and beautiful clothes and the basic attitude toward the incipient hostilities is one of agitation and concern not panic and despair. One of the areas in which the films understatement proves most effective is in positioning Wladyslaw as a man of privilege who innately believes that he can handle any situation that he can somehow finesse the rules that apply to everyone else. Even when the Nazi vise closes in on Warsaws 360000 Jews -- first requiring that they wear identifying armbands then forcing them to move out of their homes and into a ghetto that is soon walled up then making them subject to arbitrary arrest and execution -- Wladyslaw maintains an image of himself that sets him apart as he continues to play piano in a Jewish-only restaurant obtains a valued employment certificate for his father and reassuringly tells his family ""It wont last long dont worry."" Polanski reveals interesting aspects of everyday life under the first couple of years of occupation such as how the Jews were forced to move from one part of the ghetto to another at special crossing points how rumors of outside events spread and how the special Jewish police force did the Nazis bidding in many routine matters. But the early going is marred by too much dialogue thats peppered with what sound like news bulletins expository information that might have been worked more gracefully into the narrative thread. Further irritants are the stiff and unpersuasive acting by some of the thesps notably those playing Wladyslaws mother and brother and the haughty British accents affected by the cast in general. In August 1942 Wladyslaws family is among those rounded up for ""deportation"" although no one knows exactly what this means. As his parents and siblings are crammed into a freight car Wladyslaw is abruptly pulled out of the doomed crowd by an acquaintance in the Jewish police and placed in a work detail; one striking scene has the small group entering Warsaw proper where life for non-Jews is shown to be proceeding superficially at least in a relatively ""normal"" fashion. Storys second half is devoted to Wladyslaws life on his own in Warsaw. A friend helps him hide and for a long time he lays low in a nice flat from which he is able to witness the uprising in the ghetto in April 1943. As the Germans situation deteriorates over the course of the next year so coincidentally does Wladyslaws condition; starving filthy no doubt diseased and highly conspicuous with a beard and long hair he scuttles from place to place trying to avoid being seen. Finally with Warsaw all but entirely destroyed by the retreating Germans Wladyslaw is found in an abandoned house by a German captain (Thomas Kretschmann) who upon learning what the trapped man did for a living asks him to play the piano and later returns with food and the information that the Russians will be arriving soon. The physical reproduction of a vanished Warsaw has been impressively managed by production designer Allan Starski via a combination of street sets built at the Babelsberg Studios near Berlin and surviving old suburbs of Warsaw; pic marks the first time Polanski has shot in his native land in 40 years. The generally gray and pastel backdrops are inflected by few bright colors in Pawel Edelmans cinematography and Wojciech Kilars effective score is overshadowed on the soundtrack by the classical music pieces especially those of Chopin that speak to Wladyslaws profession as well as to the culture that is being suppressed if not obliterated. Quietly watching whats going on acting decisively when need be obviously horrified by his familys fate but never losing his grip Wladyslaw is mostly a reactive character and Brody gives an admirably restrained reading of the man. Hes able to convey whats important mostly with his eyes which seem to assume a naturally sad wistful look in repose. But some major elements are missing from the film factors that might have given it something more than its disappointingly modest impact. One is a strong sense of Wladyslaws scheming calculating side a picture of his special if inadvertent talents that made him one of the very small number of Jews to last through the entire war in Warsaw. Another is emotion. Polanski smartly avoids the easy melodrama that could have been generated by Wladyslaws separation from his family and he avoids sentimentality just as he has always done. But one imagines that were the film fully realized a huge outpouring of subconscious emotion would have surged to the surface when Wladyslaw finally -- stumblingly at first but then wonderfully -plays the piano again for the first time in years. In fact one feels very little throughout the entire picture which is actually quite an accomplishment given the extraordinary nature of the story.

He continues as the first bombs of the invading Nazis rock the studio. He quits only when the station is knocked off air. This behavior it turns out is typical of Szpilman on whose memoirs Roman Polanski a survivor of Polands wartime ghetto has based his very good movie. Szpilman portrayed with stoic grace by Adrien Brody clings to every last shred of normality despite confronting one of the great abnormalities in human history -- the monstrous ghetto in which Warsaws Jews were brutally forced to live. For a time he finds work playing piano in a cafe. He barely escapes transport to a death camp. He becomes a slave laborer then a fugitive finally living in the ruins of a destroyed city. Always he maintains his silence. Never does he commit a heroic or rebellious act. His only obligation is to go on living which is mostly a matter of chance supplemented by his own cunning. The Pianist is a raw unblinking film. It teaches that in dire circumstances our only obligation is to our own survival; all else -- culture ideology even love -- is a dispensable luxury. We admire Szpilman for the way he embraces that pitiless truth. We admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears our sympathies. --RS THE HOURS STARRING Meryl Streep Julianne Moore Nicole Kidman Ed Harris DIRECTED BY Stephen Daldry Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) published Mrs. Dalloway in 1925. Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) reads it in post -- World War II Southern California and it reshapes her life. In present-day New York City Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) lives a version of the day Woolf imagined for her protagonist in distant London. One can imagine this intricate intertwining of historically and geographically separate lives working as a literary conceit. Indeed Michael Cunningham won a Pulitzer Prize for it with his novel The Hours. While a reader can imagine Woolf and the others a movie must literally flesh out fictional creations and so a certain unfortunate literalness of presentation creeps into the picture. Watching The Hours one finds oneself focusing excessively on the unfortunate prosthetic nose Kidman affects in order to look more like the novelist. And wondering why the screenwriter David Hare and the director Stephen Daldry turn Woolf a woman of incisive mind into a hapless ditherer. Gentlemen she was only a part-time madwoman. Most of the time she possessed one of the most interesting sensibilities of her century. But this movie is in love with female victimization. Moores Laura is trapped in the suburban flatlands of the 50s while Streeps Clarissa is moored in a hopeless love for Lauras homosexual son (Ed Harris in a truly ugly performance) an AIDS sufferer whose relentless anger is directly traceable to Moms long-ago desertion of him. Somehow despite the complexity of the films structure this all seems too simple-minded. Or should we perhaps say agenda driven? The same criticisms might apply to the fact that both these fictional characters (and it is hinted Woolf herself) find what consolation they can in a rather dispassionate lesbianism. This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score -- tuneless oppressive droning painfully self-important. --RS Previous Page 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page Home U.S. Politics World Business Tech Health Science Entertainment Newsfeed Living Ideas Parents Sports History The TIME Vault Magazine Subscribe Give a Gift TIME Shop Newsletters Customer Service Site Map Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights Terms of Use Advertising Ad Choices (c) 2016 Time Inc.

Directed by Roman Polanski from a screenplay by Ronald Harwood based on a memoir by Wladyslaw Szpilman. 148 minutes. Rated R for violence and brief strong language. Uptown Metro. For most of Roman Polanskis wrenching Holocaust drama we hear little or no music -- a deliberate omission all the more striking in a film called ""The Pianist."" Only at the end does Polanski let us revel in the beauty of the music after a long and devastating journey and its a glorious moment. A soul has not been broken by evil and misery; art has endured. The phrase ""triumph of the human spirit"" has been uttered so often its become a hideous cliche; but Wladyslaw Szpilmans story of wartime survival is exactly what the words were minted for. Szpilman was a young concert pianist and composer in Poland before World War II. On Sept. 23 1939 he was playing a Chopin nocturne on Polish radio when the Luftwaffe bombed the Warsaw station. Six years later he played the same piece when the station began transmitting again -- the lone survivor of his Jewish family. He wrote a memoir in 1946 which was suppressed at the time but republished worldwide in 1999. Szpilman who lived his entire life in Warsaw (though he traveled the world as a pianist) died in 2000 at 89 shortly before filming began. Polanski a child in Warsaw at the time of the bombings seems to have been waiting his entire career to tell this story. ""The Pianist"" is beautifully made; shot in burnished browns and icy blues by cinematographer Pawel Edelman. Ronald Harwoods screenplay is economical and unsentimental and Polanski himself perfectly understands the value of silence -- horror in the form of a dead child lying in a wet street or a Nazi savagely beating an old man has more impact with a whisper than a shout. Adrien Brody as Szpilman undergoes a harrowing transformation; changing from a confident ever-so-slightly arrogant young artist to an emaciated wraith scrabbling for food with trembling hands and desperate eyes. ""The Pianist"" takes us step by step through his journey. Szpilman moved with his family to the Warsaw Ghetto (where Nazis rounded up the citys 360000 Jews) then narrowly missed boarding a train to an extermination camp. Helped by a network of friends and resistance fighters he was moved from place to place hiding in wall cubbyholes or empty flats. We dont get much of a sense of Szpilman pre-war or much discussion of what music means to him -- obviously Chopin nocturnes pale by comparison with survival. (Early in the movie he plays with pleasure but Brody hints at a certain businesslike detachment.) But theres a telling moment midway through as Szpilman finds himself alone in a clandestine flat with a piano. Warned that he must be quiet he sits at the piano and plays a concert piece -- his fingers an inch above the keyboard the music audible only in his head. His taut pinched face relaxes slightly; a terrible hunger has been eased. Music turns out to be Szpilmans savior quite literally in a beautifully played scene late in the film between the pianist and a German officer. And it sustains the audience as well with a final concert played with melancholy joy and ardor; its like food for the soul. ""The Pianist"" is a devastating story of survival and a tribute to the redemptive powers of art.

Starring Adrien Brody. Directed by Roman Polanski. (VHS and DVD. R. 148 minutes.) People have a tendency to adapt make do and look on the bright side. One of the many terrible unforgettable things about ""The Pianist"" the harrowing drama from Roman Polanski is that it shows how that normally healthy impulse worked to seal the doom for hundreds of thousands of innocent people during the Nazi occupation of Poland. The Holocaust has been the subject of many films. ""The Pianist"" is one of the great ones. Polanski eschews the big canvas of Spielbergs ""Schindlers List"" and follows the true story of a single individual and his family from the day the Germans invade Warsaw to the day the Allies liberate it. We never see more than he sees or know more than he knows (except what we know from history). Polanskis subjective approach takes us gradually into the horror and the effect is terrifying and also psychologically revealing. We get an idea -- just an idea but an idea -- of what it must have been like. Adrien Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman a classical pianist for Warsaw radio whose broadcast is interrupted one day in 1939 by an explosion. He goes home to find his siblings and elderly parents contemplating evacuation now that the Germans are at the gates. But a radio broadcast consoles them. England and France are joining the war. The family decides to tough it out. In a lesser movie wed see the Germans arriving and in the next scene wed see desolation bodies in the streets and people being crammed into boxcars. But ""The Pianist"" shows how this was a two-year process. At first Jews werent allowed in public parks. Then they werent allowed to keep more than a small sum of money in their homes. In one scene Szpilmans father reads incredulously that all Jews will be required to wear star-of-David armbands -- their exact color and dimension are described with typical German meticulousness. What we know to be the beginning of the end the characters regard as a mind-boggling absurdity. Its a dehumanizing process and we see the effect on Szpilman who as played by Brody starts the film with the bearing and confidence of a young man whose talent has paved the way to a golden future. Gradually doubt creeps into his eyes and then terror and then blind animal panic. His performance is so true that we dont even notice it as a performance. There are scenes in ""The Pianist"" some based on Szpilmans wartime experience and others from Polanskis own recollections that will make audiences despair of humanity. With a jovial sadism a German soldier makes old Jews dance by the ghetto gate. In another scene the Szpilman family watches as their neighbor across the street an old man in a wheelchair is thrown out of a window. Unlike Spielberg Polanski doesnt press for emotion in these scenes but presents all with cool detachment. In the meantime the audience can keep its head. We watch the atrocities mount and marvel at how despite the horrors life keeps defaulting into stasis routine the illusion of normality. There are work permits to be obtained meals to be made. So that even when the dead bodies of children are in the street and people are being stripped of everything and carted off to death camps a Polish Jew can say ""The Germans will never squander such a large workforce"" -- and we understand how hed believe it. ""The Pianist"" is the product of an extremely knowing cinematic mind. As Szpilman goes from one hiding place to another much of the action is seen from his perspective as he looks out a window. Polanski resists the temptation ever to move in for a close-up of what Szpilman is looking at.

The result is a film of riveting power and sadness revolving around the modulated intensity of Adrien Brody in the title role. Calmly and passionately addressing his past for the first time Polanski creates a huge straightforward picture built of countless small shockingly casual details of brutality desperation and kindness.

"The Pianist is the best film of 2002. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Pianist is the best film of 2002. The Pianist is the best film of 2002. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 27 2002 524 PM The Sound and the Saved The Pianist is the best film of 2002. By David Edelstein Pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman watches as his people perish Roman Polanskis The Pianist (Focus Features) has a classical detachment that keeps the cruelty at a distance--yet paradoxically heightens it. In the first scene the title character Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is playing a Chopin Nocturne live on Polish radio when German bombs hit the Warsaw station. Its 1939 and the celebrated pianist is annoyed when the windows of the control room are shattered; he keeps playing after the technicians have fled until hes blown off his bench. Advertisement When the Nazis move into the city Szpilman and his wealthy family are humiliated and then herded into the ghetto with the rest of the citys Jews but the pianists stature gives him a slight edge. He makes money playing in a ghetto cafe where the Jewish beau monde behave as if nothing has changed; and he has an offer to work for the collaborationist Jewish police which helps the Nazis keep the rest of the Jews in line. The pianist is sickened by that prospect but when his brother Henryk (Ed Stoppard) is hauled in for likely execution Szpilmans appeals to the vanity of a collaborator Itzak Heller (Roy Smiles) get Henryk sprung. And it is Heller who pulls Szpilman out of the long line for the freight train to Treblinka where the rest of the Szpilman family will perish. Treated as something of a precious commodity a special case Szpilman is shuttled by a small network of artist friends from apartment to apartment while he slowly wastes away from lack of food human contact and music. Through windows from a fixed and limited perspective the pianist watches his people perish--and history go by. The movie is grueling for long stretches wordless yet nothing in its nearly two-and-a-half hours feels unnecessarily prolonged. Polanski and his screenwriter the English playwright Ronald Harwood (working from a memoir that Szpilman wrote in the late 40s) keep the scenes short and severe like blackout sketches. Szpilman and his family watch from their apartment window as a wheelchair-bound old man in a building across the street is dumped off a balcony then the rest of his family shot down and run over The sequence with its helplessly restricted vantage is like a circus of horrors viewed by someone shackled to a seat. Each image seems concentrated as if boiled down to its terrible essence. The first hour tells a grimly familiar story--of the Jews ignorance of whats coming of the accelerating brutality of the Germans and the indifference of the majority of the Poles. The Nazis behave like sadistic ringmasters In one scene they pick Jews out of a crowd and make them dance like carnival animals the very tall with the very short; they shoot them down for spectacle and for sport. Meanwhile Polanski who escaped from the Krakow ghetto as a small boy shows the Jews going collectively insane--becoming delusional preying on one another above all standing by helplessly as people they know are slaughtered before their eyes. The Pianist is classical in its restraint but radical in its perspective--the Holocaust viewed from an eerie frozen side angle. Like Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976) its about being stuck in ones own head and going quietly mad only this time the external demons are real the threat of discovery ubiquitous. Szpilman is paralyzed as he watches from the window of an apartment on the outside of the ghetto as the uprising begins and the German tanks converge on the wall--and a month later as the defeated Jews hurl themselves out of windows or are lined up and machine-gunned. In 1976 Lina Wertmuller made a movie called Seven Beauties that presented (with vulgar bravura) a concentration-camp survivor as the ultimate moral sellout but thats not what Polanski is up to here. The Pianist suggests that the instinct for survival transcends moral categories. We dont want to judge Szpilman--and we have no right to. Thomas Kretschmann as an SS officer with a soft spot for music This is a major performance by Adrien Brody the son of the superb photographer Sylvia Plachy. At first the actor has a sleek rather finicky demeanor and he speaks in the clipped English cadences of the late Peter Cushing. (He looks a bit like Cushing too--reedy with the Jewish version of Cushings aquiline beak.) Brody has long fingers and sad rolling eyes--the perfect hammy-pianist countenance. Later after Szpilman spends months alone--miming his piano playing or staring out the window--Brodys gestures become spasmodic and his mouth twisty as if he has forgotten how to move or speak. To see this elaborately civilized man reduced to an emaciated animal state is overwhelming. And yet even then he has a kind of poetry. In later scenes confronted by an impassive SS captain (Thomas Kretschmann) he clings forlornly to a can of food he has discovered and speaks with the hopeful credulity of a Beckett tramp. The Pianist has a few piddling flaws. Its hard to keep track of all the supporting characters and the ghetto uprising sequence (viewed like much else from a window) goes by too fast. In an early scene Szpilman meets a beautiful blond non-Jewish cellist (Emilia Fox) who adores his playing and its clear the two would have had a relationship if not for the Nazi encroachment. Later Szpilman seeks refuge with a blond singer (Ruth Platt) and her husband (Ronan Vibert) an actor; and while all non-Jewish blondes dont look alike from a distance these two do and virtually everyone I know who has seen the film confuses them. I think its also important to add that this great and moral movie--the best of 2002 and one of the most indelible Holocaust films ever made--is the work of a sex criminal a man who fled this country after drugging and molesting a teenage girl in the mid-70s. I frankly dont know how to reconcile my feelings about The Pianist with my feelings about Polanski. What I do know is that he lost two families--with sickening brutality--in a single lifetime and that he has been through a hell that few of us can even imagine. Perhaps returning to his native Poland for the first time in 40 years--and to the Holocaust--has given him a new moral clarity. Perhaps it is time for this magnificent artist and monstrously conflicted human being to return to the United States and make amends. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

With this 2002 Cannes Film Festival best-picture winner he skips the quirky flourishes and simply brings history to life. Adrien Brody plays the title character classical musician Wladyslaw Szpilman as he struggles to survive the Holocaust. In a rare move for a man who consecutively spun off the macabre Cul-de-sac The Fearless Vampire Killers and Rosemarys Baby Polanski depends almost totally on story. (He did the same with 1980s Tess which was affecting enough to land Oscar nominations for best picture and director.) Yet the story is so strong that a director with his natural gifts finds no problem compelling us with a 2 1/2-hour narrative as real-life classical pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) dodges literal and figurative bullets to eke out an existence from 1939 to 1945. Review of the movie The Pianist ( out of four) Stars Adrien Brody Thomas Kretschmann Director Roman Polanski Distributor Focus Features Rating R for violence and brief strong language Opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles The movies early and stronger scenes echo what weve heard so often in Holocaust documentaries denial by Jewish families that the Germans could be planning what theyre planning and hopes diminished as atrocities occur. A neighbor in a wheelchair gets pushed out an upper-floor window and the family is shunted off again and again to increasingly meager living situations before concentration camp confinement and death. The story loses steam in the final hour when it becomes the next thing to a one-man drama as Szpilman miraculously avoids the camps and lives in hiding in a frozen abandoned house. But even here the picture rebounds with a stirring sequence in which this pianist who can no longer practice is saved by a remarkable encounter with a German officer leading to the bittersweet conclusion. This isnt giving anything away because we know going in about the ""sweet"" half of the finale; Szpilman flourished in his postwar career until his death two years ago. The Pianist isnt perfect but it stays with you and its an overdue rebound for 69-year-old Polanski. No World War II film has gotten more dramatic use out of rubble since the climactic battle in Saving Private Ryan.

"Pianist The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pianist-the ) Pianist The (UK/France/Germany/Poland/Netherlands 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli To lump The Pianist in with all of the other Holocaust stories brought to the screen does a great disservice to this powerful compelling motion picture. Crafted without a whiff of melodrama this motion picture takes a steady unflinching look at the plight of Jews in Warsaw during the years when Poland was occupied by the Nazis. For director Roman Polanski this represents his most effective film in nearly three decades. Not since 1974s Chinatown has Polanski reached such dramatic heights. How is The Pianist different from an ""average"" Holocaust drama (if there can be said to be such a thing)? To begin with there are no concentration camp scenes. Instead of taking us into the depths of Auschwitz the film leaves us on the streets of Warsaw where life and death was as uncertain a prospect as it was in the camps. In addition Polanski does not flinch from showing the naked horrors perpetrated by Nazis on Jews. There is no attempt to sugar-coat this bitter pill a we see frequent gunshots to the head torture and the effects of starvation. The tone and style of the film are documentary-like - Polanski observes from a detached perspective detailing atrocities without manipulating his audience. The result is bleak and powerful and may overcome more sensitive viewers. And we are not spared the sight of piles of corpses a these were as evident in Warsaws Jewish ghetto as they were in the death camps. The Pianist opens in 1939 Warsaw shortly after Polands defeat to Germany. The films protagonist is celebrated Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) who along with his family is forced to watch as the restrictions against Jews become increasingly more odious. Initially Jews are forbidden from eating in certain establishments walking in public parks or sitting on public benches. Soon they must wear distinguishing armbands bow to Nazis passed in the streets and walk in the gutters. Eventually all Jews in Warsaw a approximately 500000 aare moved into a ghetto where whole families are crammed into single small rooms. After the Nazis begin implementing their ""Final Solution"" most of the Jews in Warsaw are shipped to the concentration camps to be exterminated. Only those capable of labor are allowed to remain behind. Wladyslaw is separated from his family at this point. He remains behind as part of a work force while his family is herded into a cattle car. Eventually with the help of the underground Wladyslaw escapes into hiding where he battles starvation disease and cold until the arrival of the Soviets. The only actor to have significant screen time is Adrien Brody whose forceful portrayal of the title character represents one of the years best male performances. Brody starts the film as a cultured intelligent Jew but by the time the film has entered its final act he resembles a cave man. His speech has been reduced to grunts his shaggy hair and gaunt appearance recall images of those dying in the not-so-distant extermination camps and his goal of survival has devolved into two things a hunt for food and a flight from predators (the Nazis). Recognizing that The Pianist is a true story adds another layer to its impact (although it is the case that most Holocaust films are based on factual incidents). However it is Polanskis mastery that makes this movie unforgettable. While The Pianist has a strong clear narrative the director uses music and images to emblazon Wladyslaws struggle on our memories. No one who has seen this film will forget the staggering sight of the main character limping down the blasted bombed-out streets of Warsaw with twisted half-destroyed buildings lining the streets and no sign of life. The impromptu ""concert"" he gives for a Nazi officer Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) is an equal standout as music transforms (if only for a moment) the bestial-looking Wladyslaw into a magician with music. The movie ends on the perfect bittersweet note a life and hope have returned but no aspect of the future will remain untouched by the past. With The Pianist Roman Polanski has not only given us the most recent motion picture to remind future generations of what happened under Hitlers regime but he has also provided us with hope that his own career after numerous dead-ends may finally be back on track.

It has no particular ""angle"" on the Holocaust. Its not even noticeably a Polanski film. Yet The Pianist which won the Palme dOr and a standing ovation at Cannes last year is made with humility and intelligence and though its not the directors own Holocaust story (Polanski survived the bombing of the Warsaw ghetto and at age seven escaped the Krakow ghetto through a hole in a fence) I have no doubt its the movie hes been waiting to make all his life. Though the movie labors under an awkwardly expository screenplay by the British dramatist Ronald Harwood (The Dresser) it is gorgeously shot by Pawel Edelman in rich dark browns with an edge of sepia -- the colors of old photos the color of history -- and even if youre up to here with images of emaciated corpses it will break your heart many times over. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Based on a memoir written soon after the war by Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman who died in 2000 at the age of 88 a few months before filming began The Pianist stars a wonderfully restrained Adrien Brody as Szpilman who as the movie opens is playing his beloved Chopin for Polish radio. When a German bomb lands in the studio he carries on playing. Polanski doesnt milk heroism from this Either the real Szpilman was a very modest hero or he was a little detached from reality. In the movie hes monomaniacal about his work not a little egocentric less than understanding of his jealous brother and something of a dandy even when food shortages grow desperate. Hes no joiner either even though the fledgling ghetto resistance movement tries to pull him into its ranks. When after his family has been hauled off to the concentration camps an opportunity presents itself to escape the ghetto he seizes it and has no compunction about enlisting the reluctant aid of a freedom fighter. Few would have done otherwise. The rest is a series of astonishing narrow escapes as Szpilman one step ahead of the Nazis moves from safe houses to the streets to another safe house with a perfect view of the guerrilla war being fought between the Germans and those Jews with enough energy to resist. Szpilman is the lucky one the one who got away but as a fugitive hes intolerably isolated not to say absolutely lacking in control not only of his fate but of his survival minute by minute of day after day. The Pianist is particularly good at depicting the terrifying blend of arbitrary personal sadism by individual German soldiers and the institutional brutality of the Nazi machine. And however unsparing the movie is in cataloging the Jews desperate predicament the movie is never reductive. It shows us good and bad Jews good and bad Poles and a cultured Nazi sensitively played by Thomas Kretschmann who saves Szpilmans life after hearing him play and whose life the musician cant manage to save in return. Like that of many Holocaust survivors Szpilmans story is so inherently dramatic that as it plays out in The Pianist you have to keep reminding yourself that all this really happened. Polanski wisely doesnt interpret or explain. He seems to have decided that in the face of such meticulously planned horror the best one can do is get the details right.

Aug. 15 705pm Premium Seating Los Angeles Angels v SEATTLE MARINERS Tickets Mon. Aug. 15 705pm AS OPINIONATED AND SELF-CONSCIOUS AS The Pianist is unassuming Max -- a first feature written and directed by Dutch screenwriter Menno Meyjes -- suggests that had young Adolf Hitler managed to get his art show the Holocaust might never have happened. This seems absurd not to say insensitive on its face but Meyjes whos best known in this country for writing the overheated script for The Color Purple has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of Nazi politics and aesthetics. Set in Munich in 1918 when Germany was smarting from its humiliating defeat in World War I the movie turns on a tenuous friendship between two veterans of the battle at Ypres -- Max Rothman a Jewish art dealer (hes a composite of several real-life Jews from the art world who helped Hitler sell his work) and Hitler himself who is unemployed starving and longing for some recognition of his sentimental paintings. Max played with lazy elegance by John Cusack has it all money sophistication a beautiful Jewish wife (Molly Parker) and loving family and a shiksa mistress (Leelee Sobieski). Having lost an arm to the war he can no longer paint but hes thrown himself into the burgeoning modernist art movement that sprang up in Germany between the wars exhibiting the abstract work of George Grosz Max Ernst and others (who later were numbered among the ""degenerate"" artists persecuted under the Third Reich) in the cavernous gallery hes set up in a disused railway station. Hitler whos played by Australian actor Noah Taylor is as appalled by the new art as he is fascinated by the rise of right-wing populism and anti-Semitism among former soldiers of his own class. But again hes desperate for recognition and Max through some combination of pity fellow feeling and patronage encourages the resentful young nerd. Taylors performance is clearly intended to be provocative designed to liberate Hitler from the jackbooted toothbrush-mustached cliches his image has accumulated over the years. So its unfortunate that Taylors histrionic acting makes of the future Fuhrer a cartoon in its own right. Buried under layers of pallor-inducing makeup the actor whines and scowls and froths at the mouth and it doesnt help that Meyjes screenplay loads him up with declarative topic sentences -- ""The man has no technique"" ""War is the hygiene of the world"" ""Politics is the new art"" -- that drain away from the movies central insight which is that Max and his protege have one fateful thing in common They both believe in the future. As a painter Hitler is a failure but Max comes to see that he is a gifted designer who for all that he abhors the abstract modernists has learned much from them. Except that where Max and his Dadaist friends imagine a freer more liberal and tolerant world to come Hitler sees the future as a return to some fancied glorious past governed by purity of blood. We know whose vision won but Meyjes is not alone in suggesting that the Nazi aesthetic was shaped by the modernist aesthetic. Some historians now believe that Hitler was as much a man of his time (not to mention an intellectual autodidact) as he was a rebel against it. Meyjes takes pains to show that Hitlers rise depended upon a disenfranchised and reactionary proletariat but he cant resist giving the story a last-minute tweak that implies that it was mere chance that shaped Hitlers destiny and that of European Jewry. In the movies final scenes Max and Hitler arrange a meeting to go over Hitlers promising new sketches. For the most urgent of reasons Max doesnt show. The rest is history -- or one idea too many by a writer-director with a penchant for going over the top.
