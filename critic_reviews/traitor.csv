By Peter Rainer Film critic July 1 2016 Save for later Saved Our Kind of Traitor stars Ewan McGregor (l.) and Stellan Skarsgard (r.). Jaap Buitendijk          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide John Le Carres novels have been adapted so many times sometimes superlatively for the movies and television that each new arrival seems to conjure up all the others. ""Our Kind of Traitor"" directed by Susanna White from a script by Hossein Amini and starring Ewan McGregor and Stellan Skarsgard is in the midrange in quality better than a few not nearly up to say ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"" ""The Russia House"" or the TV miniseries ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy."" Which is not to say the movie is anything less than diverting. Its just that diverting is often all it is.McGregor plays Perry a British academic vacationing in Marrakesh with his lawyer wife Gail (Naomie Harris) as they attempt to patch up their marriage. There they encounter Dima (Skarsgard) a wealthy boisterous Russian with mob connections who it turns out wants Perry to persuade the British government to secure his familys escape in exchange for proof that a British MP (Jeremy Northam in a bit role) is laundering dirty money for the Russians.Its all far-fetched in a way that only international spy thrillers - bless their hearts - can be. Perhaps the most far-fetched thing about it is Skarsgards Russian accent. But he strikes a sympathetic note as a man whose obstreperousness cannot disguise his ferocious love for his family. McGregor by contrast seems a bit miscast as an addled academic who must locate his inner ninja. Grade B (Rated R for violence language throughout some sexuality nudity and brief drug use.)

""Essentially"" he wrote ""how do you tell a story it took the author 165000 (my guess) good and necessary words to tell with 12000 words (about the number of words you get to say in a two hour movie based on 150wpm speaking rate less 30% silence and action) without flattening everybody into gingerbread men?"" Chuckle all you want at the hilariously precise Kubrickian calculations but in the letter (which can be found at the Stanley Kubrick Archive held by University of the Arts London) the director makes an astute point. As far as action and incident are concerned le Carres expansive stories are often dense and mundane. But the way the characters think speculate and speak -- and the detailed milieu in which the author sets them -- makes the books compelling even riveting. And for that you need ""good and necessary words"" -- a lot of them. Many filmmakers have wrestled with le Carres words; few have won out. The best recent le Carre adaptation Ive seen Tomas Alfredsons Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy discarded plot clarity and instead elevated atmosphere and psychology You could smell the years of cigarette smoke caked into the gray walls of its Cold War interiors and follow the characters glances -- indicative of secret passions and long-held resentments -- even if you didnt care too much about the incomprehensible minutiae of who-did-what-where-and-when. I saw the film three times always moved by it and still couldnt explain to you a damn thing that happened in it.Susanna Whites Our Kind of Traitor adapted by Hossein Amini doesnt quite have as ornate a story or as vast a cast to work with -- the book is one of le Carres shorter works -- but even one richly drawn figure can buy a lot of suspense. The plot is built around the very idea of charisma. During a vacation in Marrakech Perry (Ewan McGregor) a forlorn English academic trying to mend his marriage to lawyer Gail (Naomie Harris) is approached by boisterous Russian businessman Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) who spends long nights partying and drinking thousand-dollar bottles of champagne. Their meeting however turns out to have been not entirely coincidental.Dima is a veteran money launderer for the Russian Mafia and hes about to lose his empire -- and most likely his life -- to a brutal new kingpin called the Prince who is consolidating power and slaying anyone who gets in the way. So Dima wants to escape with his family to safety in the U.K. and is prepared to give up both the Prince and some high-ranking British officials tainted by mob ties. Perry chooses to help Dima get in touch with MI6 even though he himself knows nothing about espionage. That sounds promisingly Hitchcockian but since the source is le Carre the story winds up being more about budget approvals account numbers and government oversight than international conspiracies or last-minute escapes (though one of those is quite effective marvelously staged by White). But our investment in the characters holds it together. As played by Skarsgard Dima is a wonderful creation a tattooed garrulous bear of a man who regards sex and violence with nonchalance but perks up at any demonstration of honor or bravery. You can tell this crook has seen some shit and that the rarest thing in his world right now is an honest man -- a touching revelation.The mostly reactive Perry doesnt captivate quite so much. Hes a typical spy-story protagonist the wrong man in the wrong place at the right time. But McGregor brings depth to the role. He beautifully portrays his characters thinking His sharp inquisitive eyes and thin lips seem forever caught between a smile and a grimace. That uncertainty serves the story well as bookish Everyman Perry befriends world-weary criminal Dima and mulls how far to risk his own life in the process. Theirs is a classic matchup and Our Kind of Traitor is at its best when it lets them dance.

Neither can I. Who better to play a college poetics professor who apart from being a principled sort is utterly unremarkable? (DJ Qualls would have been the honorable choice.) Knowing a kosher salt when he sees one a money-laundering Russian mob accountant (Stellan Skarsgard boisterous as a jack-in-the-box coiled and prone to physical outbursts both random and amusing) inveigles the altruistic patsys sympathy in order to facilitate a deal with British Secret Service to help usher his family to safety in exchange for top-secret documents. Government agents generally play to one of two extremes all bad or all good. Underneath the power frames Damian Lewiss ruthless MI6 agent grooves on the complexities of moral functioning needed to turn his otherwise rank-and-file pest into an appreciably well-heeled heel. The mid-summer release of an adult effects-free British thriller relating to the collapse of Europes global financial system timed out perfectly.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 01 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 01 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Susanna White Written by Hossein Amini Starring Ewan McGregor Stellan Skarsgard Damian Lewis Classification 14A Genre thriller Year 2016 Country U.K./France Language English Did we believe in James Stewart as the titular everyman in Hitchcocks The Man Who Knew Too Much? We totally did. Did we believe in Cary Grant as a Madison Avenue executive mistaken for a spy in Hitchcocks North by Northwest? One supposes so. And do we believe in Ewan McGregor as the poetry professor Perry Makepeace who by pure happenstance gets roped into some good old-fashioned international espionage involving a money-laundering Russian oligarch and British intelligence officers? Eh.Early on in Our Kind of Traitor a capable enough adaptation of the 2010 John le Carre novel we find McGregors Makepeace (some name) befriended by Dima an outsized and gregarious Russian businessman played with ravenous enthusiasm by Stellan Skarsgard. Its a party in exotic Marrakesh and baby does it swing - with blondes on stallions and pool-side cocaine. ""What"" Makepeace asks himself ""am I doing here?""The camera lens gets blurry. Makepeace successfully breaks up a rape and gets slugged for his valiance. Hes extracted from the party by the burly Dima but hes clearly in over his head.What follows is a somewhat convincing British spy thriller and entertaining cooks tour through Paris the French Alps and London. Directed by Susanna White and written by Hossein Amini Our Kind of Traitor packs a middleweight punch and no wit. The intrigue is loose but Skarsgard is gloriously heavy. Hes also buck naked at times.But lets get back to Makepeace. Hes married to a sparky lawyer played by Naomie Harris. Lets hope you know this talented actress from the James Bond films Skyfall and Spectre because you wont know her from Our Kind of Traitor. Shes underused and pretty much literally along for the ride here. That the producers dont get their Moneypennys worth out of her is not her fault though.Shes been wronged by Makepeace; their trip to Morocco was made in hopes of restoring their relationship. Our man gets his chance at redemption when he becomes embroiled in a high-stakes plot involving the British foreign service the Russian Mafia and political bribery.What happens is that Dima is being squeezed out by a new brand of Russian mafia that is dishonourable. He wants to turn on them by striking a deal with British intelligence thus ensuring the safety of his family. (Our kind of traitor.) Because Dima can trust no one he enlists a layman - Makepeace - to help him get shady global banking information into the right hands.Makepeace finds his professorship to be unsatisfying - poetry is boring ""when you study it under a microscope"" - and maybe hes secretly relishing his unlikely introduction into the world of international sneakery. Maybe he is but it doesnt really come across by McGregor. A little more Walter Mitty from him would spice up the character. As it is his earnestness comes from a place of wanting to do the right thing thus rectifying a moral transgression of his from the past.The result is Makepeace as a bland hero. The likeable McGregor may be our kind of star but hes not Hitchcocks.Have I mentioned Damian Lewis? Hes Hector a taciturn MI6 officer with a real hate on for a former boss of his who is now a high-ranking politician - one he strongly suspects of snakery. Hes resourceful and determined but understaffed. Thus he has no problem at all putting Makepeace and his wife in harms way.Like James Bond Hector constantly runs up against bureaucratic interference. Unlike Bond he wouldnt know a Pussy Galore if she popped up in his soup. (He likes to cook)Scratch off Lewis as a contender for the new Bond actor. As for McGregor he may have failed his audition as well. Our Kind of Traitor is tense enough but lacks lustre and pizzazz. Perhaps a better-utilized Harris could have popped things up. So back to Bonds maybe its time for a promotion for Harris and Moneypenny both.

The performances are fine but theyre not enough to rescue this would-be thriller from its own contrivances.McGregor plays a college professor on vacation with his wife (Naomie Harris) when he makes the acquaintance of Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) while dining at an expensive restaurant. Dima is a sleazy oily Russian gangster but Perry is intoxicated by his personality and they end up hanging out together all night. Good times.Except Dima has more on his mind than just friendship. He passes Perry a flash drive and asks him to bring it back with him to the UK. Red flag Perry is stopped at customs while returning home and is interrogated by an agent named Hector (""Homelands"" Damian Lewis). Perry ends up with his fate anchored to Dima in ways that simply dont seem realistic.Perry is a man of his word but his loyalty comes at the expense of any semblance of common sense as ""Our Kind of Traitor"" unspools. The movie grossly overestimates the audiences sympathy for a murderous thug and its interest in the morality of international banking. ""Our Kind of Traitor"" values honor but theres no honor in being dumb.agrahamdetroitnews.com(313) 222-2284twitter.com/grahamoramaOur Kind of Traitor GRADE CRated R for violence language throughout some sexuality nudity and brief drug useRunning time 107 minutes 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/29hLJND MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/07/01/review-morality-tale-kind-traitor-fails-test/86573922/,200,traitor5,traitor,detroitnews

(JAAP BUITENDIJK / Roadside Attraction)GALLERY Spies like us Ewan McGregor and Stellan Skarsgard... (JAAP BUITENDIJK...)By Tirdad Derakhshani Staff WriterPosted July 02 2016I wonder whether its possible to make a bad John le CarrA(c) movie Every one of the 15 films and miniseries based on his espionage thrillers is well worth watching. There are the masterpieces including Martin Ritts The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965) and the BBCs 1979 miniseries Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. But even the weakest films - the 1984 terrorism romance The Little Drummer Girl and the 1990 Cold War love story The Russia House - still outstrip most spy movies. Director Susanna Whites Our Kind of Traitor a Russian mafia bromance is a lesser entry but theres much to recommend. Based on the 2010 novel it stars Ewan McGregor as Perry Makepeace a professor who is on holiday in Marrakech with his power-lawyer wife Gail (Naomie Harris) when hes approached by a Russian mobster (Stellan SkarsgAY=rd). SkarsgAY=rd (the father of The Legend of Tarzans Alexander SkarsgAY=rd) is all hand gestures and belly laughs as the gregarious bigger-than-life bruiser Dina. One of Russias top money-launderers Dina hands damning evidence about his bosses to Perry and begs him to deliver it posthaste to British intelligence. Hes terrified he tells Perry that the new mob boss (Grigoriy Dobrygin) plans to wipe out his whole family. McGregor is highly likable as a clueless and sheepish - if secretly sly - Hitchcockian everyman who knows hes out of his depth the second he gets sucked into the spy game. Less palatable is Damian Lewis as Hector an MI6 middle manager who handles Dinas case. Lewis so wonderfully understated in Homeland is too intense here. His character prone to go off on extended monologues about ethics seems to speak every third word in italics. Le CarrA(c)s work is so effective in part because his stories usually feel so plausible and grounded.Our Kind of Traitor strains credulity The world it attempts to depict - international organized crime - is too large too unmanageable and too easily caricatured. With its emphasis on action and exotic locales it feels closer to Ian Fleming than Le CarrA(c)s more cerebral work.

"Familar spy thriller Our Kind of Traitor fades into scenery - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Familar spy thriller Our Kind of Traitor fades into scenery Our Kind of Traitor; Jaap Buitendijk / Lionsgate / Roadside Attractions Naomie Harris and Ewan McGregor in the movie ""Our Kind of Traitor."" Naomie Harris and Ewan McGregor in the movie ""Our Kind of Traitor."" (Jaap Buitendijk / Lionsgate / Roadside Attractions) Gary Goldstein Its competently made well-acted and largely intelligent so why isnt the spy thriller ""Our Kind of Traitor"" more rewarding? Perhaps its the feeling that weve trod this kind of twisty treachery on screen ad infinitum since before the Cold War-era stylings of Alfred Hitchcock -- and far more vividly. That the film directed by Susanna White is based on a novel by prolific -- and oft-produced -- espionage master John le Carre may add to the deja vu.Poetics professor Perry (Ewan McGregor) and lawyer Gail (Naomie Harris) are on a romantic holiday in Marrakech when they become enmeshed in the fallout from an international money-laundering web. The trouble starts when Perry to Gails dismay befriends showy persuasive Russian mobster Dima (Stellan Skarsgard).  Perry then impulsively -- and incredibly -- agrees to deliver secret information to British intelligence that will implicate a corrupt Parliament member (Jeremy Northam) extricate Dima from the Russian Mafia and ensure the safety of Dimas family.Suffice to say this is all easier said than done especially once a steely MI6 agent (Damian Lewis) gets involved. Globe-trotting murder and cat-and-mouse intrigue ensues but without a glut of action or mayhem. This relative restraint might have been more admirable if the pragmatic script by Hossein Amini took the time to explore Perry and Gails shaky relationship instead of allowing their woes to ultimately fade into the nicely shot scenery.-------------Our Kind of TraitorMPAA Rating R for violence language throughout some sexuality nudity and brief drug useRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesPlaying In limited release See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Naomie Harris HBOs new programming boss talks True Detectives fate pulling the plug on Vinyl and a hope for more diversity Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mini-our-kind-of-traitor-review-20160627-snap-story.html,200,traitor7,traitor,latimes

Credit Jaap Buitendijk/Roadside Attractions Every so often a news story shows up that seems to beg for fictionalization. Its no wonder that so many journalists love playing make-believe producers as when they write that the news theyre covering ""has all the makings of a Hollywood movie."" These days though the major American movie studios are more in the business of comic-book intrigues than in realism. Even so the continued trickle of adaptations of John le Carres work (including the recent miniseries ""The Night Manager"") suggests that someone still believes that theres a market for adult stories about real-world stakes. Video Movie Review Our Kind of Traitor The Times critic Manohla Dargis reviews ""Our Kind of Traitor."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date June 30 2016. . Mr. le Carres 2010 novel ""Our Kind of Traitor"" -- with its Russian mobsters British civilians and international intrigue -- certainly sounds ready for its closeup. And its framework is more or less intact in this murky (narratively visually) adaptation which stars Ewan McGregor as Perry a professor of poetics whose dreary life perks up after hes swept up in a scheme involving a charismatic gangster Dima (Stellan Skarsgard). The head of the money-laundering enterprise for a Russian mob Dima wants to cut a deal with the British intelligence that would guarantee the safety of his family in exchange for information about politicians on the mobs take.Unsurprisingly there are complications both geopolitical and conjugal. Its a combination that will be familiar to fans of Mr. le Carres George Smiley books in which marital infidelity -- with its convulsions of deception and betrayal -- is at once personal and political an ingenious tradecraft means of attack and a maker of lost faith. In the screen version of ""Our Kind of Traitor"" by contrast Perrys relationship troubles with his wife Gail (Naomie Harris) arent organically integrated into the intelligence story and only siphon attention away from the cloak-and-dagger doings. Though it proves a marital aid of a type the spy stuff could have used a lot more tender loving care. Video Clip Our Kind of Traitor A scene from the film.

Watch in Times Video >> embed The director Susanna White makes a lot of strange choices including the dark fussy visuals best described as stained-glass noir. As an Expressionist choice it doesnt make much sense. Then again neither does much of ""Our Kind of Traitor"" which has loads of twists and all the ritualistic pessimism you expect but none of the political and moral outrage that might have elevated this genre story into a le Carre one. Mr. Skarsgards outsize turn gives the movie energy even if it does the wanly paired Mr. McGregor and Ms. Harris no favors. Damian Lewis as a single-minded British agent proves better ballast to Mr. Skarsgard and together they suggest what might have been.""Our Kind of Traitor"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Short)  Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris in Our Kind of Traitor.  (Entertainment One)  By Peter HowellMovie Critic and Linda BarnardStaff Reporter and Bruce DeMaraEntertainment and Nick PatchStaff ReporterThu. June 30 2016Swiss Army ManStarring Daniel Radcliffe and Paul Dano. Directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. Opens Friday at the Varsity. 97 minutes. 14AIt seems safe to say there will be no crazier film this year involving major actors than this existential love story. And maybe no more beautiful one either.Swiss Army Man is written and directed by Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan a.k.a. ""the Daniels"" of music video fame. They make ample use of their imaginations and visual talents to tell a unique love story.Article Continued BelowPaul Dano is Hank marooned on a remote Pacific Ocean isle who has come to realize that no one is coming to rescue him. Hes prepared to take desperate measures to end his loneliness -- until the day the body of a man played by Harry Potters Daniel Radcliffe washes ashore.Hank becomes involved with the stiff he calls ""Manny"" in ways that seriously need to be seen to be believed. It all makes for the strangest of bromances one thats destined to divide audiences as happened at the films Sundance premiere back in January. There were a few walkouts.No sensibilities are spared as Hank makes use of Mannys surprising dead-guy talents which include mad flatulence that allows him to be ridden like a JetSki and handy skills at providing water and starting fires. Go ahead and guess how Manny works as a compass.When Manny begins to shows signs of an after-death personality -- is it a zombie thing or is Hank going crazy? -- all bets are off as to where this story is headed. But its impossible not to get caught up in it even if youre simultaneously repelled by it.Peter HowellWeinerDocumentary by Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg. Opens Friday at Bloor Hot Docs Cinema. 96 minutes. 14ACo-directors Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg begin their doc as a redemptive chronicle of disgraced former U.S. Democratic Congressman Anthony D. Weiner. It turns into an astounding chronicle of hubris.Weiner resigned in 2011 after tweeting explicit photos of himself to young women online. Afterward he penitently claimed to have ceased his sordid habits but the lie catches up to him as he runs for NYC mayor in 2013.The camera catches his shock and paralyzing fear and the anger and dismay of his wife Huma Abedin and campaign staffers as an online gossip site reveals the candidate is still sexting women at least one of whom is seeking some kind of vengeance.Wrapped up in his own narcissistic bubble Weiner allows the astonished Kriegman and Steinberg to continue filming him to devastating effect.Peter HowellThe DaughterStarring Sam Neill Geoffrey Rush Paul Schneider and Odessa Young. Directed by Simon Stone. Opening Friday at Cineplex Yonge amp; Dundas. 91 minutes. 14AHenrik Ibsens The Wild Duck shifts from Norway to a moodily decaying Australian lumber town for this drama about a potentially heartbreaking long-quiet family secret.Estranged for years from his wealthy mill owner father (Geoffrey Rush) Christian (Paul Schneider) returns from the U.S. for the old mans wedding to his much-younger housekeeper. There he reunites with a childhood friend Oliver (Ewen Leslie) now married and with a teen daughter Hedvig (Odessa Young impressive).Oliver is out of work since the mill closed. Hes a struggling while damaged Christian who denies his demons and pieces a mystery together that will have far-reaching consequences if he cant keep it to himself.After a slow build the final act picks up the pace but director Simon Stone shows his hand too early. Still its chilling to watch the wreckage pile up.Linda BarnardThe Purge Election YearStarring Frank Grillo Elizabeth Mitchell and Mykelti Williamson. Directed by James DeMonaco. Opens Friday at major theatres. 109 minutes. 18AThe world has gone so topsy-turvy that the dumb-fun Purge franchise now qualifies as political satire.By vowing to end the annual Purge -- the one night when murder is legal -- underdog presidential candidate Sen. Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) has made seriously psychopathic enemies. Naturally they choose the grisly fiesta to take her out.She relies on her loyal security (Frank Grillo Anarchys taciturn butt-kicker) a deli owner (Mykelti Williamson spouting the best lines) and a Good Samaritan who kills like a samurai (Betty Gabriel) to ward off hordes of white-supremacist mercenaries ""murder tourists"" and bloodthirsty schoolgirls in gory corsets.Occupy Trump Black Lives Matter and the NRA all figure into the ideological swirl but purge the urge to look for real meaning. Like the election it clumsily invokes the lively third Purge is as thrilling as it is silly.Nick PatchOur Kind of TraitorStarring Ewan McGregor Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Susanna White. Opens Friday at major theatres. 107 minutes. 14AThe Cold War may be over but the Russian mafia schemes to infiltrate London one of the worlds financial capitals to launder dirty money.Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris are British couple Perry and Gail holidaying in Morocco and struggling to get past infidelity. They encounter Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) a bluff Russian with a prodigious memory for numbers.Dima desperate to avoid certain death at the hands of a ruthless oligarch sees a ""gentleman"" and honest soul in Perry drawing him into a plan to defect by providing information on crooked British politicians.The performances are lovely and director Susanna White manages to wring maximum tension from the cat-and-mouse game. Fans of spy novelist John le Carre may take umbrage with the reworked ending but the film is nonetheless a riveting and accomplished work.Bruce DeMaraThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Roadside Attractions hide caption toggle caption Roadside Attractions Gail Perkins (Naomie Harris) and Perry Makepeace (Ewan McGregor) in Our Kind Of Traitor. Roadside Attractions Our Kind of Traitor is the first thriller adapted from a John le Carre novel to be directed by a woman -- not that youd notice from the sang froid with which British filmmaker Susanna White serves up the gruesome carnage that opens the movie. A Russian family having sold its soul to a soft-spoken local mafioso (Grigoriy Dobrinin) is methodically massacred on its way to safety by a hit man with clear blue eyes and a thousand-yard stare. Well run into this assassin later doing what he does best as were swept around glittering capitals of the global economy pausing to goggle at the depraved doings of brassy new elites in gold-plated nightclubs. Thats where the post-millennial thriller goes for fun these days. Moral compasses are not invited though a lost soul like college professor Perry (Ewan McGregor) may rise to the desperate occasion if tested. Marking time in a Marrakech dive while on a vacation thats meant to revive his ailing marriage to Gail (Naomie Harris latterly Skyfalls Moneypenny) Perry is scooped up by Dima (Stellan Skarsgard enjoying the f-word to its fullest) a burly party animal and money launderer to the mob. Dimas connection to the slain family has placed him in peril and after softening Perry up with a visit to an orgy he persuades the reluctant prof to slip some classified information to British intelligence in return for safe passage for Dima and his family. ""I need some of your f------ British fair play"" roars Dima. Forgive his fantasies This is all pre-Brexit and clearly he hasnt read the le Carre oeuvre where even English fair play takes a pounding when MI6 gets into the mix with its own iffy agendas. Perry dithers Dima yells and soon the refugees find themselves herded from one scenic or scummy European hot spot to the next not knowing whom to trust or fear. Its a whole new multi-culti world of good and evil in which -- admirably -- nothing much is made of the sly casting of Egyptian actor Khalid Abdalla as a British intelligence agent. The movie observes its crimes and misdemeanors through warped glass or mirrors set at wonky angles as if to underscore the moral murk that hovers over pursuers and pursued alike. The ambience of contaminated elegance suggests underlying depth yet screenwriter Hossein Amini with input from le Carre himself is working with pretty thin material. Moral ambiguity has always been one of le Carres great subjects but for my money the writer has never been as comfortable working the post-Soviet post-Berlin Wall world as he was in his superb Cold War novels. Which may be one reason why the best le Carre film adaptation since 2000 remains Tomas Alfredsons 2011 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy which took us back to le Carres brilliant spy George Smiley. Theres a Smiley of sorts in Our Kind of Traitor too an MI6 agent with Old Etonian diction and a trimmer waistline. Played with understated flair by Damian Lewis Hector Meredith has his own scores to settle and his own code of honor. But as the keeper of the films existential doubt hes a feeble ghost of the Smiley whose task as he saw it was to deploy the unpalatable against the Soviet unspeakable. Here the villain is the toxic alliance of political corruption with the business underground and though Our Kind of Traitor has a deft turn of the screw at the end for all its blather about honor and courage the movie doesnt really go anywhere with its inquiry into the new evil. That may be because Perry is such a wan construct dwarfed in every way by his new friend the money launderer. ""Why did you choose me?"" the plaintive professor asks. ""There was no one else in the restaurant"" booms Dima and roars with laughter as he heads out to do what a mans gotta do.

EntertainmentMovies Our Kind of Traitor succeeds despite implausible plot Originally published June 30 2016 at 1223 pm Naomie Harris and Ewan McGregor play a couple on holiday who get caught up in international espionage in ""Our Kind of Traitor."" (Jaap Buitendijk) Movie review of Our Kind of Traitor With its fine performances and moody cinematography this spy thriller starring Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris is smart entertainment. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic ""Our Kind of Traitor"" directed by Susanna White (HBOs fine ""Parades End"") and based on a John le Carre novel is an elegant well-made spy thriller with just one problem believability. Perry (Ewan McGregor) is a London professor whos on holiday in Marrakech with his barrister wife Gail (Naomie Harris) trying to patch their troubled marriage back together. While there he befriends a money launderer for the Russian Mafia Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) and agrees to transport a memory stick in his luggage back to London to give to the British intelligence agency M16. ""I thought I could just hand it over and be done with it"" says Perry who has clearly never in his life seen a movie nor read a John le Carre novel. (He also at an earlier point willingly hands over his credit card to Dima. I always thought that ""Dont give your credit card to a mob-connected money launderer"" was the kind of advice that could go without saying but apparently not.) As you can imagine Perry and Gail are soon pulled into the center of a complex hurricane of dirty money corrupt politics and international espionage. And if you can accept Perrys actions as the logical behavior of a not-insane man (a stretch to be sure though McGregor really sells it) ""Our Kind of Traitor"" otherwise works as smooth smart entertainment from its swirling music to its moody cinematography to its fine performances. I particularly liked Skarsgards haunted Dima -- theres an entire movie in this mans weary side-eye -- and Damian Lewis as perpetually smiling M16 agent Hector. A late scene with Perry and Hector in which neither man can say what he actually thinks is fascinating; its a subtle little master-class in acting. Movie Review    Our Kind of Traitor with Ewan McGregor Naomie Harris Stellan Skarsgard Damian Lewis Jeremy Northam Khalid Abdalla. Directed by Susanna White from a screenplay by Hossein Amini based on the novel by John le Carre. 107 minutes. Rated R for violence language throughout some sexuality nudity and brief drug use. Several theaters. The movies good enough to suspend skepticism; ""Our Kind of Traitor"" by its end made me believe. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

More News 11 Best Movies of 2016 So Far How Tom Hiddleston Makes Psycho Sexy The Night Manager A Cloak-and-Dagger Masterpiece All Stories >> Related Alt-Summer Movie Preview 2016 The Wild WTF and Oh-So-True From docs on sex scandals and rock stars to a stop-motion samurai epic your cure for the summer blockbuster blues The film flies highest on the wings of two dynamite actors Stellan Skarsgard as Dimitri ""Dima"" Vladimirovich Krasnov a big roaring bear of a Russian money launderer looking to defect; and Damian Lewis as Hector Meredith a reserved British intelligence officer who helps save Dima and his family as long as it suits his own agenda which may be more personal than it is professional. What hurts is that Skarsgard and Lewis must take a backseat to a pair of characters who occupy more screen time. They would be Perry Makepeace (Ewan McGregor) a college professor and his barrister girlfriend Gail Perkins (Naomie Harris). No knock on McGregor and Harris -- fine actors both -- but they never hold us rapt the way the plot demands. Perry and Gail are on vacation to heal a relationship bruised by Perrys habit of boffing his students. In Marrakesh they meet Dima and his family and get in over their heads by reaching out to Hector and helping Dima and his family defect before a revenge plot wipes them out. The device is pure Hitchcock something akin to James Stewart and Doris Day in The Man Who Knew Too Much. But White lacks the masters skill at building and sustaining our interest in these fish out of water. Its the cat-and-mouse game between Dima and Hector that creates the almost unbearable tension and suspense. It also reveals the humanity in two dangerous men whose survival mechanism relies on keeping their personal feelings in check. By the end Lewis -- outstanding in TV projects as diverse as Homeland Billions and Wolf Hall --takes possession of the movie by revealing with quiet devastation a lifelong cynic in the act of growing a conscience.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1200am on Thursday Jun. 30 2016 Thursday Jun. 30 2016 Monday Jun. 27 2016 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Our Kind of Traitor has all the earmarks of an enjoyable if disposable contemporary thriller intrigue exotic locales evil Russians Moneypenny from the James Bond movie Spectre a John le Carre pedigree and Ewan McGregor looking frightened.But unfortunately the predictable sum is less than its potentially entertaining parts.McGregor is Perry Makepeace a British university professor on vacation in Morocco with his wife Gail (Naomie Harris aka Moneypenny). Their marriage is in trouble and its something Russian mobster Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) picks up on when he spies them across a restaurant.After Gail walks out Dima invites lonely Perry over for a drink with his Russian pals.Dima lures Perry deeper into an instant friendship (they bond even more over a tennis game the next day) and then Dima reveals his true motive He believes his new boss dubbed The Prince (Grigoriy Dobrygin) is going to kill him and his family.As Dima doesnt have faith in any of his henchmen he needs Perry to deliver some information and a message to MI6 involving high-ranking English politicians making cozy deals with Russian crime gangs. In return for that information he wants protection and asylum in Britain.Based on a novel by John le Carre and directed by Susanna White ( Nanny McPhee Returns) Traitor could be a jolt of a joyride with Perry being the unenviable man in the middle not knowing whom to trust.Instead it limps from plot point to plot point with little suspense to a conclusion that offers few surprises.The performances are solid especially Skarsgard Damien Lewis as the MI6 contact and Khalid Abadalla as his assistant but thats not enough to make Our Kind of Traitor our kind of movie.

TWITTER 5/13/2016 Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris star as a couple mixed up with Stellan Skarsgards Russian mafioso in this adaptation of John Le Carres thriller. With the TV adaptation of novelist John Le Carres The Night Manager drawing attention in the U.S. after its successful U.K. run it would seem to be an especially fortuitous time for distributors on both sides of the pond to be releasing Our Kind of Traitor at least from a marketing point of view. Whats more with so many effects-driven blockbusters about in this late-spring early-summer window the pic could profitably soak up members of the older upscale demographic whose literary tastes stretch beyond comic books. But Traitor suffers somewhat in comparison with Night Manager Feature length doesnt always suit the longform dense storytelling of Le Carres work. Director Susanna White whose varied resume includes some very fine TV (Parades End Bleak House Jane Eyre) and the larkish Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang and the ever-distinctive d.p. Anthony Dod Mantle (The Celebration 28 Days Later Rush) work hard to compensate with stylish jet-set-sexy cinematography. Nevertheless although engaging enough to hold interest the just slightly off casting of Ewan McGregor and Stellan Skarsgard as respectively an academic and a Russian money launderer caught up in MI6 shenanigans dampens plausibility. Ultimately its a middling effort as Le Carre adaptations go better than The Tailor of Panama (2001) or the uneven A Most Wanted Man (2014) but not in the same class as the 2011 version of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy let alone that last books immortal TV adaptation from the Cold War glory days. The screenplay by Hossein Amini a writer who has done both literary adaptations (Jude Wings of a Dove The Two Faces of January) and offbeat action (Drive Snow White and the Huntsman) only dickers moderately with the original novel. Most of the major changes presumably stemmed from decisions to cast younger names (such as Damian Lewis playing a character whos much older in the book) or the need to take advantage of finance incentives for using certain locations like Morocco where the opening scenes are set. Either way the movie still functions as a travelogue of picturesque settings some just gritty enough to appease viewers who prefer to think of themselves as richer in cultural capital than mere tourists. The milieu and vibe is halfway between a spread in Conde Nast Traveler and a Bourne movie. After an opening prologue that contrasts the high-culture world of the Bolshoi Ballet (with a cameo from dancer Carlos Acosta) with a brutal Mafia-ordered slaying of a family of three in the snow the action cuts to a fancy resort near Marrakech. Academic Perry (McGregor) and his lawyer wife Gail (Naomie Harris) are trying to mend their relationship after Perrys affair with a student. When Gail is called away to make a conference call Perry lets himself be tempted by an invitation from wealthy Russian Dima (Skarsgard affably hammy bad at the accent) to spend the night partying in the mountains queuing up opportunities for Dod Mantle to bust out some glassy reflections electric colors variable focus shots and light flares to suggest hedonistic wooziness. The two men bond further the next day over a game of tennis and Gail gets to know Dimas wife Tamara (Saskia Reeves) and the various children in their entourage. But soon it becomes clear that Dima has befriended the couple for a particular purpose He wants them to help negotiate his escape from the clutches of the Russian mob for whom he works. It turns out that the dead-eyed oligarch met in the prologue (Grigoriy Dobrygin) known only as the Prince and his underlings will kill Dima and everyone in his family just as they did with the brood in the opening scenes unless Perry and Gail can persuade the British government to help. Dimas only bargaining chip is his promise to provide hard proof that a British MP (Jeremy Northam) is being paid off by the Russians and abusing his influence to help them launder dirty money. At Heathrow Gail and Perry meet MI6 handler Hector Meredith (Lewis rocking a fantastic pair of hornrims that perfectly suggest his characters eccentric bookishness) who is perhaps just a little too keen to help and persuade the two of them to help patriate Dima to the U.K. Khalid Abdalla (The Kite Runner) and Mark Gatiss (Sherlock) round out the cast as Merediths fellow spies and while they make the most of their screen time both feel seriously underutilized as are Reeves Northam and to be honest Harris who spends most of the rest of the film scowling seriously or babysitting the kids while McGregor and Skarsgard stalk down streets and sneak around hotels. This is where even a fairly responsible well-intentioned feature adaptation like this will suffer in comparison with a TV series. With so much backstory to get through and gobs of explication to shoehorn into the dialogue there never seems to be enough time to explain basic motivations persuasively. Many might come away wondering exactly why Perry would want to trade in lecturing on The Waste Land (hes supposed to be a professor of poetics a cute touch) in a brightly lit lecture hall for risking his life for a man he barely knows. Is the chance to earn air miles and pick up some duty-free really that tempting? White does make some interesting choices to go for a quieter tone where another director might have elected to milk it with big gestures and loud noises. A key moment involves an explosion far in the distance barely heard on the soundtrack but the loss is as significant as the fall of Icarus as in the famous Brueghel painting on the same subject celebrated in Audens poem ""Musee des Beaux Arts."" Indeed whats best about the film is the way it evokes the sense of momentous power struggles political shifts and tragic events happening just out of earshot or on the edge of the narrative while others just go about their daily lives how ""the ploughman may/ Have heard the splash the forsaken cry/ But for him it was not an important failure.""

Comments Our Kind of Traitor Video Rated R  108 minutes  2016 A British professor of poetics (Ewan McGregor) trying to salvage his marriage with a romantic vacation in Marrakech has a chance encounter at a bar with a Russian mobster (Stellan Skarsgard) who convinces the scholar to help him turn on his bosses and expose a conspiracy that extends to the upper echelon of British intelligence. (Many more non sequiturs follow.) I havent read the John le Carre novel that inspired this incoherent mess but I have to imagine the old spymaster connected the dots better than they are here. To judge by the puzzled looks plastered on the actors faces for the entire movie they had no clue what any of it meant or why anyone would care. Susanna White directed.

In subtitled Korean and Japanese. Theater St. Anthony Main. Brace yourself for mythic weirdness. Korean director Na Hong-jins supernatural thriller will throw you for a loop. It begins as a sort of quirky Asian ""Fargo"" about a low-ranking policeman Jong-gu (Kwak Do-won a comedic common man with solid screen presence). Hes ineptly investigating a series of mysterious fatalities in his rural village. Are they due to hallucinations caused by wild mushrooms or connected to an eerie Japanese stranger living in the woods? Paranoid accusations finger everyone. When Jong-gus daughter is seized by the victims venomous signs of possession he seeks help from a shaman of rock star charisma (Hwang Jung-min combining the magnetism of James Franco with stronger acting chops). And then literally all hell breaks loose. The film operates on an amazing sensory level with each shot brilliantly composed to trigger your emotional synapses. As the film moves from whodunit to whats-happening its points of view fluctuate gags shift to electrifying guts and gore and visual clues are revealed as red herrings. Its deliberately designed as a baffling film and still never loses its dramatic balance. Kim Hwan-hees performance as the cops stricken daughter makes Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist"" look like a Disney princess. Feed Loader Danny DeVito in ""Wiener-Dog."" IFC Films Colin Covert Wiener-Dog [?][?][?] out of four stars Rated R for language and some disturbing content. Theater Uptown. A four-part sick joke from cinemas dean of depressive coldhearted humor Todd Solondz. The flawless cast includes Danny DeVito Julie Delpy Greta Gerwig and Ellen Burstyn playing people who adopt and abandon a lovable sausage-shaped dachshund. Revolving across a quartet of Americas classes and regions the pooch observes suffers and helps comfort human shortcomings. The characters are quickly introduced wild cards that keep the audience guessing and the dog is extra-cute -- sure to elicit endless awwwwws. Theres even an animated intermission where we hear ""The Ballad of the Wiener-Dog"" an original ditty by Tony winner Marc Shaiman complete with YouTube-worthy shots of the titular pup waddling here and there. He is far more adorable than the human characters presented here with Solondzs trademark cynicism. But while he triggers viewers Pavlovian impulse toward interspecies affection (a theme the lightweight trailers present as the focus of the whole film) the dark subtext is how we all face the challenges of life and death. While it would be spoileriffic to reveal the conclusion be warned ""Benji"" it aint. C.C. Our Kind of Traitor [?][?] out of four stars Rated R for violence language nudity and drug use. More character drama than heavyweight spy suspense film this adaptation of John le Carres old fashioned British espionage story feels like a middle-range TV miniseries. Its slickly made generic forgettable ho-hum. On a romantic getaway in Marrakech Ewan McGregor and his lawyer wife Naomie Harris cross paths with Stellan Skarsgard a Russian tycoon who invites them to share a few days of his decadent high life. All he asks in return is for McGregor to carry a USB drive back home to MI6. That he says will expose corrupt officials in London earning him asylum in the capital city and protection from the Russian Mafia. Despite detours to Paris and the Swiss Alps not much in the way of thrills arrive. In the past Ive respected but not enjoyed Le Carre films which are overly abstract; this one I enjoyed scarcely at all. Credit where its due however. Director Susanna White delivers fine cinematography throughout and may soon be doing second unit work on the next James Bond film. C.C. Therapy for a Vampire [?][?][?] out of four stars Rated Unrated. Theater Edina. Count Geza von Kozsnom (Tobias Moretti) is a vampire bored with his life and wife (a terrifically icy Jeanette Hain) in 1930s Austria where he seeks help from Sigmund Freud. Another of Freuds patients a young artist named Viktor is having issues with his girlfriend Lucy. When the two cross paths the Count finds that Viktors lover is a spitting image of his former true love Nadila -- and he begins to pursue Lucy. Writer/director David Ruhm incorporates classic Hammer Films and ""Love at First Bite"" in this entertaining vampire spoof by keeping the pacing brisk the jokes quick and the blood gushing. JIM BRUNZELL III Tickled [?][?][?]1/2 out of four stars Rated R. Theater Lagoon. When reporter David Farrier stumbled across a ""competitive endurance tickling"" video he decided to investigate further into the ""sport."" Traveling around the world to find answers he found few people willing to speak out on what the videos meant and who was behind them. Farrier and co-director Dylan Reeves hallucinatory saga begins as an amusing caper eventually unfolding into the discovery of severe cases of blackmail corruption and the underbelly of a darker internet terror. Not quite answering every question it asks ""Tickled"" still opens a dangerous ""can of worms"" of stranger-than-fiction journalism. J.B. Les Cowboys [?][?][?]1/2 out of four stars Rated R for violence drug use. Theater Edina. What triggers someone to abandon her family and root out all traces of her culture and society? That question pulses through Thomas Bidegains slow-burning homage to ""The Searchers."" As in John Fords classic western the need of this films protagonist to rescue is all-consuming. Frenchman Alains daughter has vanished having eloped with her Muslim boyfriend and decided to live under Islamic law. His search morphs into a seemingly endless quest thats ultimately passed down to his son. What does it mean to search for someone who doesnt want to be found? Bidegain keeps the answer poignantly elusive while shining an unforgiving light on the weight that bears down on a soul in perpetual journey.

Photo Jaap Buitendijk MOVIE REVIEW Our Kind of Traitor Running time 107 minutes. Rated R (profanity violence nudity sexuality drug use). A tightly controlled British spy thriller with more brains than heart ""Our Kind of Traitor"" is a dismal low-energy affair. On vacation in Marrakech a London professor (Ewan McGregor) having difficulties with his wife (Naomie Harris) strikes up a friendship with a gregarious vaguely seedy Russian (Stellan Skarsgard) who asks for their help in delivering a memory stick to the British spy agency MI6 (ably represented by a natty Damian Lewis). It contains scandalous info about Swiss bank accounts. The story lacks both kiss-kiss and bang-bang though Talky and slow-moving the John le Carre adaptation fails to make us care much about the Russian who turns out to be a master money launderer or make the unlikely friendship with the professor credible. Even the titular character a British pol who is responsible for his colleagues son going to prison is a thinly imagined background figure whom we meet only briefly. For all its machinations and scene changes the movies emotional temperature is strictly room.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan June 30 A British couple get embroiled with a Russian oligarch and high-profile money launderer while on holiday in Marrakech Morocco. (Roadside Attractions) ""Our Kind of Traitor"" boasts a series of onscreen titles that signal a certain kind of thriller -- one that hops from Moscow to Marrakesh to London to Paris to Bern to the French Alps with the clockwork regularity of a James Bond film. But the hero of this dutiful yet effective adaptation of a 2010 John le Carre novel is no gunslinging international man of mystery. Rather he is a mild-mannered British professor of poetry with a soft spot for the bullied and a notable lack of firearms training. When the aptly named Perry Makepeace (Ewan McGregor) finally does get hold of a pistol only toward the end of the film he picks it up like it smells funny. The fact that the person handing it to him -- a loudly effusive tattooed Russian thug on the lam named Dima -- is played by Stellan Skarsgard contributes significantly to the films pleasures. Skarsgards accent might not be utterly convincing but he seems to be having so much fun with the part of a money launderer for the mob who has handled as many handguns as deposit slips that its easy to forgive a slippery vowel or two. British poetry professor Perry Makepeace (Ewan McGregor) left decides to assist an on-the-outs Russian mobster (Stellan Skarsgard) with a story to sell in ""Our Kind of Traitor."" (Jaap Buitendijk/Roadside Attractions) Naomie Harris and McGregor play the vacationing couple at the center of the film. (Jaap Buitendijk/Roadside Attractions) The strange alliance between Perry and Dima begins in Morocco where the Russian has befriended the vacationing Perry and his girlfriend Gail (Naomie Harris of ""Skyfall"" and ""Spectre"") handing the academic a thumbdrive with instructions to turn it over to MI6 the British intelligence agency when the couple gets home. It seems that Dima -- who has been marked for a bloody purge by his new boss (Grigoriy Dobrygin) -- is seeking asylum for himself and family in exchange for information linking a high-ranking British official named Longrigg (Jeremy Northam) to the Russian mafia. Perrys willingness to do what most others would say ""heck no"" to speaks more to his weakness than his bravery. It also imparts a slight whiff of preposterousness that the film for the most part manages to outrun. In keeping with the films brisk pace it isnt long before Perry has made it his private mission to help Dima in ways that go far beyond the Russians original request. An MI6 agent (Damian Lewis) begins to assist Perry motivated by his own personal vendetta against Longrigg. Director Susanna White who was nominated for Emmy Awards for the television miniseries ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Generation Kill"" keeps the tension just taut enough as Russian hoodlums pursue Dima and his family and the British bureaucracy scrambles to obtain passports for them. No theres nothing earth-shaking about ""Traitor."" No topical reverberations or thorny moral quandaries. Just a respectful appreciation for the old-fashioned political thriller in an adaptation by screenwriter Hossein Amini (""Drive"") that knows how to get the job done. Theres little of the poetry that Perry teaches in the script but the storys mechanics are solid. R. At area theaters.

"Our Kind of Traitor starring Ewan McGregor Naomie Harris underwhelms - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Our Kind of Traitor starring Ewan McGregor Naomie Harris underwhelms Trailer Our Kind of Traitor Watch the trailer for ""Our Kind of Traitor."" Watch the trailer for ""Our Kind of Traitor."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Many aspects of ""Our Kind of Traitor"" mark it indelibly as John le Carre material moody ruminative one foot in the movies one foot in the real world.Early on theres an abrupt love scene between Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris that by narrative design ends before it gets going. Harris plays Gail a London barrister married to McGregors character Perry a literature and poetry instructor. The marriage is on rocky ground; we hear of the husbands affair with a student. Perry and Gail are vacationing in Marrakech (it was Antigua in le Carres 2010 novel) and there they meet Dima a gregarious but lethal Russian money-launderer for the Russian mafia played by Stellan Skarsgard dining out on a role originally meant for Mads Mikkelsen. (For a time Ralph Fiennes was scheduled to play the McGregor role.) MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOURA bearlike mobster who loves his family Dima is trying to save his skin and get his wife and children to England. After a night of Moroccan debauchery Perry agrees to sneak a flash drive through customs for Dima and to deliver incriminating information (a list of British politicians and financiers backing a bank deal funneling dirty Russian billions into the U.K.) to the hands of British intelligence. Damian Lewis plays the MI6 point man smiling even when being threatened. Its one of the strengths of le Carres story adapted for the screen by Hossein Amini that Perry never knows quite how much to trust his own handler in this risky bit of international brinkmanship. The plot proceeds from Morocco to London to Paris and then ultimately to a bloody standoff in the French Alps. Typical of le Carre theres a refreshing de-emphasis on casually glorifying gun violence in ""Our Kind of Traitor."" (In other words le Carre sticks to his guns by not sticking with them.) Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle saturates his digital imagery with great washes of yellow and green and brown; the look of director Susanna Whites proficient moderately engaging film is slick and creamy more so than the usual le Carre affair. Our Kind of Traitor review Roadside Attractions Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris star in ""Our Kind of Traitor."" Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris star in ""Our Kind of Traitor."" (Roadside Attractions) I dont the think the ""look"" is quite right for the story. Nor is the dreamy wandering score by Marcelo Zarvos which adds the blandest sort of ambient ""tension music"" to whatevers going on. McGregor struggles to make Perry credible in his credulousness; Harris far better doesnt have enough to do; Skarsgard is fun.

Imagine youre an average Joe who stumbles into a situation full of danger and intrigue. How do you react? And more importantly are you up to the challenge?Thats what happens to Perry (Ewan McGregor) a rather frayed British professor vacationing with his wife in Marrakesh. Its not a particularly happy trip. Gail (Naomie Harris) is a successful lawyer who cant leave work behind. Perry is frustrated by his career and recently ended a fling with one of his students. The two seem to exist in silence with tiny drops of conversation scattered in between.In ""Our Kind of Traitor"" Dima (Stellan Skarsgard foreground) takes a liking to Perry (Ewan McGregor) after a night of partying. (Photo Jaap Buitendijk)One night Gail leaves Perry behind in a restaurant to take a phone call. He strikes up a conversation with Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) a big bearish Russian in a leather jacket. Dima is friendly and jovial sure but hes also vaguely threatening. Still the two hit it off. Soon Perry is partying with Dima snorting cocaine and eyeing prostitutes including one whom he defends from an attacker.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceDima impressed by Perrys surprising vigor has a proposal for the dispirited professor. He reveals that hes the top money launderer for the Russian mob and now he fears for his safety. He wants Perry to take a USB drive to British intelligence. On the memory stick is information that links a British politico (Jeremy Northam) and other VIPs to the mob. Dima wants to spill the beans; in exchange he wants to defect along with his family.Perry (Ewan McGregor) and Gail (Naomie Harris) are pulled deep into a complicated plot in ""Our Kind of Traitor."" (Photo Jaap Buitendijk)Does Perry take the bait? Well it would be a short film if he didnt. But in this slow-burn thriller adapted from a 2010 book by John le Carre the intrigue comes as Perry and Gail are pulled deeper into the quagmire. Gail in particular is presented with a compelling situation. Logically she knows she should bolt but shes also concerned about the fate of Dimas family including two orphaned twins who have come under his care. That gives her an idea of the kind of forces they are dealing with.Director Susanna White keeps things low-key and absorbing as the action moves from Marrakesh to London to Paris to Switzerland. The movie doesnt boast the travelogue flair those locations suggest though there is an effectively sinister sequence set against a French housing project which isnt a typical movie setting.Hector (Damian Lewis) is an MI6 agent in ""Our Kind of Traitor."" (Photo Jaap Buitendijk)McGregor and Harris are both good and its interesting to see how their relationship shifts as they are drawn further into Dimas situation. McGregor disheveled and more low-key than usual seems perfectly benevolent and one anxiously awaits his reactions though le Carre may have overplayed his hand when he gave the character the last name of Makepeace.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestSkarsgard covered in a road map of tattoos is riveting offering a character that doesnt really recall anything else hes done.

Photo Credit Studio Canal / Japp Buitendijk advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A classics professor becomes a reluctant player in a British-Russian information exchange. CAST Ewan McGregor Stellan Skarsgard Naomie HarrisRATED R (some bloody violence)LENGTH 147BOTTOM LINE Feeble action and bogus plotting make this one of the dullest John le Carre adaptations youll ever see. Imagine youre a literature professor vacationing in beautiful but lawless Morocco. Youre alone in a restaurant when in walks a Russian gangster named Dima. He invites you for a drink then to a cocaine party and eventually asks a favor Could you take this thumb drive of incriminating information to MI6? Hed do it himself you see but he and his family would be killed. Would you oblige? If so congratulations Youre the dumbest tourist in the history of international travel. advertisement | advertise on newsday Ewan McGregor plays that professor named Perry in ""Our Kind of Traitor"" based on one of John le Carres less plausible novels. Perry is a hero whose shoes are impossible for us to step into partly because hes ridiculously noble -- at that party he stops a rape by attacking the massive perpetrator -- and partly because he never suspects hes being duped or used. When MI6 agent Hector (Damian Lewis) asks why anyone would ferry information for a criminal he just met Perry answers guilelessly ""He seemed scared."" PhotosBooks turned into moviesPhotosMovies that got zero-star reviewsPhotos10 best movies of 2016 so far Driven almost entirely by such threadbare motivations ""Our Kind of Traitor"" is the rare le Carre adaptation in which everything is exactly as corny as it seems. Youll wait in vain for a shocking betrayal or a stunning revelation. Instead youll get a rudimentary plot about a British politician Aubrey Longrigg (Jeremy Northam) whos taking money from a Russian oligarch named The Prince (Grigoriy Dobrygin). We barely meet either one so its a little difficult to care. The films one bright spot is Stellan Skarsgard as Dima. Wearing a leather jacket and an oily mullet Dima looks like movie mobsters often do but Skarsgard turns him into an appealing personality with a lust for life and a world-weary wisdom. Naomie Harris by contrast is ill-used as Perrys wife Gail whose job is to stand by her gullible man and provide a lap for any frightened children. Directed with a strange sense of calm by Susanna White from Hossein Aminis belabored screenplay ""Our Kind of Traitor"" skimps on action and never builds anything close to suspense.

The actor has so often played dire and/or imposing scarf-wearing men (he even looked grim during Mamma Mia though in retrospect perhaps that was understandable) that a Skarsgard character inviting a stranger over to have a drink with him and his comrades should be cause for immediate suspicion. But poor college professor Perry (Ewan McGregor boasting long hair and a contrasting buttoned-up manner) shows only the minimum reluctance at the outset of Our Kind Of Traitor. Tensions with his lawyer wife Gail (Naomie Harris) have radiated through an aborted attempt at a romantic dinner during an aborted attempt at a romantic getaway. So when Dima (Skarsgard boasting long hair and a complementary boisterous Russian accent) beckons and immediately starts referring to Perry with a booming affectionate cry of ""PROFESSOR"" Perry responds. The two men form a mutual trust at a near-ludicrous speed.Dima as it turns out is a money-launderer who wants out of the Russian mob and hopes Perry will be able to deliver information to British intelligence which will help him and his family. The pinched officious face of British intelligence is provided by Damian Lewis as Hector who intercepts Perry and Gail when they return to England. Perry has several opportunities to more or less cut and run but he sticks around and tries to work his way out of this mess as befits the particularly unslick hero of a John le Carre spy novel from which Our Kind Of Traitor was adapted.Our Kind Of Traitors story requires some leaps especially in fully believing Perrys near-instant loyalty to Dima and his ability to participate in complex international espionage. But the film balances out some potential preposterousness with quotidian details of Dimas and Perrys respective family lives. (There is a reason for Perry and Gails hesitant attempts to rekindle their relationship.) For that matter the spy stuff isnt ridiculous enough to qualify as sexy. Even for a le Carre adaptation--sometimes an invitation for dry realism--much of the story flirts with the rote exposition dumps uncooperative spooks and bureaucrats and the frequent exchange of meaningful glances.Director Susanna White on only her second feature jazzes up the proceedings to match the skill of actors like McGregor Harris and Skarsgard. Most notable is her smart use of cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. Together they give the movie bleary textures and rich colors especially its yellows blues and greens. Some of the visuals have a dreamy edge without going full-tilt feverish striking just the right balance of shimmery glamour and digital grit. White also gooses interpersonal conflicts by often framing McGregor and Harris through glass or having them share the frame via their reflections.The presence of Trainspottings McGregor 28 Days Laters Harris and the cinematographer of Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours among others brings to mind Danny Boyle which in turn can make Our Kind Of Traitor feel like the kind of stodgier British films Boyles rebelled against fed through more modern filmmaking techniques. But Whites keen eye and her strong cast make a case for this type of hybrid which matches the marriage of domestic and geopolitical drama at the films center. Our Kind Of Traitor develops slowly but not dully into the right kind of old-fashioned thriller.

Another ho-hum tale by John le Carre (one of his weaker efforts published in 2010) Our Kind of Traitor is about a civilian couple that tangles with Russian mobsters on a vacation in Morocco and end up trying to stop a government conspiracy to covertly endorse a money laundering crime syndicate in London that goes all the way to the top of the U.K. power block. Overexposed and barely awake in the most dramatic scenes Ewan McGregor is the star but its not one of his most energetic performances. The movie is easily stolen by Stellan Skarsgard as the seedy Russian crook and Damian Lewis as an M16 British intelligence agent with an agenda of his own. Its pokey and preposterous and the thrills it promises arrive too late to matter. No wonder Stellan Skarsgard makes such an impression from his first scene charging into frame full-frontal naked from a sauna--beefy pot-bellied long-haired and covered with tattoos. Now thats what I call an entrance. OUR KIND OF TRAITOR  (2/4 stars) Written by Hossein Amini Directed by Susannah White Starring Ewan McGregor Stellan Skarsgard and Damian Lewis Running time 107 min. After two years of delays that resulted in the defection of Ralph Fiennes as the star and too much tinkering with the script to guarantee smooth sailing Our Kind of Traitor has finally arrived directed by Susanna White with a screenplay by Hossein Amini who wrote the brilliant underrated Two Faces of January but only about half of it seems to have survived the cutting room floor. Perry Makepeace (McGregor) a university poetry professor and his wife Gail (Naomie Harris) a barrister are on holiday in Marrakesh when they meet a gregarious flamboyant and overbearing Russian named Dima (Skarsgard). In the hotel bar he confides in Perry that he controls a vast fortune in laundered money for the Russian Mafia that is in the process of being moved to London illegally and concealed in a newly opened bank funded by some of the most powerful members of Parliament. Dima gives Perry a memory stick containing vital secrets that will expose the scheme and send key cabinet members to prison convincing him hes a poor slave of the Kremlin who is desperate to protect his family from being murdered. All he asks in return is asylum in the West. Perry is not the brightest bulb in the lamp but he agrees to help despite his wifes objections. This kindhearted but life-threatening mistake plunges them both into a dangerous world of international espionage that takes them on a journey to a fashion show in Paris a safe house in the French Alps and the shadows of political corruption and greed in the British underworld. Back in London Perry who is ridiculously naive for a college professor is targeted interrogated and stalked by a ruthless M16 agent (Mr. Lewis) who will stop at nothing to expose his ex-boss (Jeremy Northam) as a government traitor who is being paid billions of pounds by a Russian crime syndicate to filter mob money from London into numbered bank accounts in Switzerland. The absurd plot asks the viewer to believe Perry is the only one who can get the illustrious names on those numbered accounts from Dima while the death toll mounts. Anyone with a computer can do the same thing in a matter of minutes but you dont talk logic in a movie like Our Kind of Traitor or it would be over in half an hour. The theme of innocents abroad out on a limb to save the world was more fun back in 1943 when Fred MacMurray and Joan Crawford played newlyweds on a European honeymoon stranded behind Nazi borders in Above Suspicion. ""We dont even know these people"" protests Gail in one of the films few lines that make sense. ""You dont know the people you defend"" counters her clueless husband as though that justifies taking on the U.K. government the Russian mob and dozens of unidentified killers with assault rifles hell-bent on reducing the population. The movie stumbles further in the direction of incredulity when the secret agent acting as a poor mans 007 compares the governments willingness to look the other way to the profits they made from heroin in Afghanistan arms in Sudan female trafficking and other sins that pumped billions into the British economy. The premise is not without purpose but cliches abound the film lacks narrative thrust and the camerawork looks like one of those slick British Cadbury commercials for after-dinner mints.

Ewan McGregor (left) Naomie Harris and Damian Lewis in ""Our Kind of Traitor."" Photo Japp Buitendijk/StudioCanal TNS Our Kind of Traitor has a good first hour 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Mysteries have to work in two ways. They have to make us want to know whats going on and then -- this is the hard part -- keep us interested after we find out. The spy thriller ""Our Kind of Traitor"" gets the first part of that equation right. For almost an hour it keeps us off balance. But once we find that balance the movie seems to coast. Instead of expanding it contracts. It becomes a small story about a handful of people and once it slows down we have time to notice other little problems. That is we have time to become skeptical and wonder at the motivations of the characters. We start seeing them not as people but as entities being maneuvered by the demands of plot. Still the movie begins well stays there for a while and never really falls apart. Based on the novel by John le Carre ""Our Kind of Traitor"" starts off with a couple on holiday trying to blast through a rough patch in their relationship. In a restaurant one night the man Perry (Ewan McGregor) is approached by a boisterous Russian who invites him to have a drink with his friends. The Russian (Stellan Skarsgard) is a hard guy to say no to. Hes persistent familiar and charismatic but with the faint hint of something unsavory and threatening about him. Skarsgard locates his performance in that odd zone where appealing meets scary and hes by far the most interesting thing in the movie. McGregor who goes through the proceedings looking as if hes slept in his clothes for a few days running is nominally the protagonist but his role is mostly reactive. The only thing he doesnt react to here is a shower or a bathtub or for that matter soap and water. Naomie Harris as his partner Gail has a role thats even worse. She has to keep reacting to McGregors reactions -- and keep resisting and then relenting as Perry is drawn further into the Russians circle. The story of ""Our Kind of Traitor"" turns on a favor that the Russian asks Perry to do for him very early in the movie. Its a matter of life and death but as favors go its easily done and given the persuasiveness and engaging quality of Skarsgards performance its very easy to believe that Perry would do it. But the movie suffers from a small but nagging fault in the construction After Perry does the one favor theres no reason for him to continue to be in the movie. Theres even less reason for Gail to be in it. Of course theyre in it -- hes the star and shes standing next to him -- but the movie has to come up with reasons they should want to keep putting themselves in danger. The script suggests that Perry just has an exaggerated sense of duty and doesnt care about consequences but thats a weak justification. Thats rather like saying ""He does these things because hes the kind of guy who does these things."" In any case its one thing to expect an audience to worry about characters who are dragged into trouble and struggling with all their might to disentangle themselves. Its quite another to expect us to worry over the fate of a guy who is so worked up about other peoples problems that he forgets to wash. Such a case is not so difficult after all. A little less altruism and a little more hygiene and hed be fine. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Area Theaters. Yet another John Le Carre novel has been adapted to the screen but few of his fans will be thrilled by this one. Back in the 70s Le Carre was a literary superstar-youd have a hard time finding a parents bookshelf that didnt include at least one of his political thrillers. Many of those novels have been adapted to film including ""The Little Drummer Girl"" (1984) ""The Constant Gardener"" (2005) and ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" (2011). By the time Le Carre wrote his 2010 novel ""Our Kind of Traitor"" he had already fallen out of favor with readers maybe because the end of the Cold War cooled interest in his type of spy thriller. Similarly the movie adaptation doesnt feel like a spy movie despite the inclusion of British MI6 agents trying to take down the Russian Mafia known as ""the Vory."" Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris play husband and wife Perry and Gail vacationing in Morocco despite their marital conflicts. On a night out Perry meets Dima (Stellan Skarsgard from ""Thor"") a boisterous Russian criminal who invites him to have a drink. Perry is brought into the strangers world of endless partying and the next day Dima confesses to the Englishman that he means to defect to the UK -- and willing to supply MI6 information on the Vory in exchange for their help. Back home the couple is greeted at Heathrow by MI6 agent Hector Meredith (Damian Lewis from ""Homeland"") who convinces them to work with him to take down the Vory while also fulfilling Dimas request. The BFG charms but is not a giant step forward for Spielberg As with many political thrillers ""Our Kind of Traitor"" has a fairly complex plot with plenty of moving parts. Opening at the Russian ballet we watch a young ballerinas parents being murdered after her father signs a mysterious deal but it will be over an hour before we learn what this scene has to do with the vacationing couple or the Russian gangster they meet while on holiday. Even with a decent cast ""Our Kind of Traitor"" mainly falters due to the snails pace at which it unveils its plot. Generally one expects political thrillers to offer a little more suspense or excitement so when this is such a deathly dull affair you wonder what you might be missing. Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris play a married couple whose life gets shaken up by a Russian defector in Our Kind of Traitor. The casting of McGregor and Harris at least gives some humanity to the couple at the storys heart especially the drama between them. But between Stellan Skarsgards deplorable Russian accent and Lewis inability to make more out of his spy character the intrigue never really take off. Sure part of the problem may be British television director Susanna Whites efforts to be faithful to Le Carre for the sake of the books fans. One could just as much fault screenwriter Hossein Aminis adaptation for the same reason. Todd Solondzs Wiener-Dog has too much bite The MI6s help eventually leads to Perry Gail and Dimas family in hiding from the Russian mob Dima betrayed. You already have this feeling things wont end on a positive note -- and they dont. As much as ""Our Kind of Traitor"" tries to sell itself as a classic British espionage thriller with spy work this boring this isnt our kind of movie.

By Anthony Lane The aliens return in Roland Emmerichs sequel to his 1996 movie.   Credit Illustration by Paul Hoppe Twenty years ago in ""Independence Day"" an alien attack was repelled by David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) a scientist so brilliant that he even knew how to send a virus from his laptop. Assistance was provided by his grumpy father (Judd Hirsch) a Marine Corps pilot (Will Smith) and Tom Whitmore (Bill Pullman) who was the leader of the free world and of the airborne defense. So noble was their effort apparently that it ushered in two decades of universal peace armed conflict among nations has subsided and the world in line with John Lennons instructions has lived as one. Needless to say this dreary state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist and the bracing news brought by the sequel ""Independence Day Resurgence"" is that the aliens have returned to harvest Earths molten core. Who will stop them this time around? Whitmore is now a shaggy ruin with a walking stick and a supply of meds; the current President (Sela Ward) seems decisive but the film confines her to the fringes of the action. Meanwhile Smiths character has died either because Smiths agent considered the financial package insufficiently galactic or more likely because Smith read the script. The pilots son Dylan Hiller (Jessie T. Usher) is now in the hot seat though sadly he lacks the firepower of his fathers personality. Rivalry flares between Hiller and Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) a fellow sky jockey but it peters out after a single punch in the canteen. In short its up to Goldblum to save the film. (The world by comparison is easily saved. It always is.) I will watch him in anything; that stop-start delivery all ums and hums combines with his smile--so winning yet so quick to die--and his buggy eyes to suggest a soul both hyper and hazed-over. You never know quite how he will respond to any predicament nor you sometimes feel does he. The main reason for the success of ""Independence Day"" was the mashing together of Goldblum and Smith. They were a genuine odd couple--the wonkish ruminant sharing a cockpit with Mr. Congeniality whose days flew by without a flutter of self-doubt. No surprise then that Goldblum seems a little lonely and marooned in the latest venture which suffers from a nagging case of Smithlessness. Theres nothing here to compare with the eruption of joy back in 1996 when our heroes hurtled free of the enemy stronghold by the merest squeak eliciting from Smith the triumphal roar ""Elvis has left the building."" The director now as then is Roland Emmerich who like a constant lover refuses to tame his devotion; and what he loves is enormity. The incoming mother ship this time is round and flat and three thousand miles in diameter as if the aliens deepest ambition were not to exterminate us but to make paella for everyone on the planet. And if you dig the ship check out the mother--the queen of the meanies who rolls up late in the show gambolling across salt flats toward a school bus full of innocent children. In a way Emmerich is more fearless than any of his characters boldly embracing cliches from which other directors would shrink and flee and unabashed by his old-school craving to astound. Witness the gravitational field exerted by the ship which can suck buses cars and bridges out of a city and whoosh them upward. As a spectacle that is outdone only by the spooky sight of Judd Hirsch who hasnt aged a minute since the last film. The first ""Independence Day"" had the gratifying slap of good pop cinema harmless and weightless; the follow-up is twice as big and half as fun. Even the special effects begin to pale and some of them in the closing scenes feel sketchy and unfinished. Either Fox ran out of time or cash or Emmerich taking his cue from Schubert simply threw up his hands and said ""Screw it. Thatll have to do."" In truth the film doesnt really end let alone draw to a cathartic conclusion; it just stops. If you must see it then at least try to do so as I did in IMAX and 3-D. This is known as immersive moviegoing and what it means in practice is that rather than watching London being destroyed before your very eyes you are left with the distinct impression that London is being destroyed midway between your eyeballs. Everything quakes. For the price of a single ticket I got to experience a two-hour sci-fi extravaganza and had my sinuses drained at the same time. You cant argue with value like that. No one but John le Carre would write a novel called ""Our Kind of Traitor."" That unstable compound of clubbability and deceit belongs to him alone. The book which appeared in 2010 has now become a film directed by Susanna White. Its hero is Perry Makepeace (Ewan McGregor) who would rather not be a hero at all. He is married to Gail (Naomie Harris) a lawyer; he teaches English literature at a university in London; and his surname betrays a constitutional wish to stay out of trouble. But trouble comes to find him anyway. It takes the portly shape of Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) an effusive Russian thug. (His naked body glimpsed at a sports club is so richly inked with tattoos that its more like a treasure map than like a living form.) Dima works for the Mafia of his motherland and his job is to launder money as efficiently and no doubt as regularly as the rest of us wash our shirts. He has fallen foul of his employers however who will soon exact vengeance and his plan is to trade his wicked secrets--some involving British politicians--for a new life plus a new identity in England. But how can he communicate with the spymasters of London and not alert his predators who presumably track his electronic spoor? If Dima asked me I would say ""Write a letter and pop it in the mail"" but I guess that might abbreviate the plot. Instead he befriends Perry who is on vacation at the same hotel in Marrakesh. The Englishman wary of being impolite accepts a glass of Chateau Petrus not a wine that you should ever spurn and an invitation to a night of Bacchic misrule. Thus wooed he agrees to transport a memory stick on Dimas behalf only to find himself wading up to his chin in the slime of the intelligence game. The novel was adapted by Hossein Amini who clearly enjoys the challenge of tough texts. If you have conjured screenplays as he has from Thomas Hardy Henry James Elmore Leonard and Patricia Highsmith then le Carre is no cause for alarm and some of Aminis alterations are well wrought. Where Perry and Gail in the book are on their trip because she has inherited a slab of money the movie tells us--with a shot of her lying sadly in bed reluctant to make love--that they are trying to repair a dented relationship. That suits the mood of sorrow (le Carre long ago persuaded us that a country can fray and fail as easily as a marriage) and it also suggests why Perry might accede to Dimas plea--not out of moral probity or patriotic duty but simply for the thrill. How better to rouse your sex life than by turning into a spy? And yet there is a blank space in this film where plausibility should dwell. Since the end of the Cold War le Carre has increasingly drawn his players not from the corridors or smoky pubs of power but from the amateur ranks--the tyros and the patsies who are leaned upon to answer powers bidding. That is as true of Perry as it is of Jonathan Pine in ""The Night Manager"" (recently dramatized and shown on AMC) although in the case of the bookish Perry you are tempted to ask Does the fun of the film--a shoot-out in a forest a midair explosion and so on--take place for real or could it all be unfolding inside his brain? Maybe he did nothing more than sprawl on a Moroccan beach with a copy of Graham Greene glance at Russian tourists and feed them into his daydream of a plot. A hint of that reverie hangs over the movie thanks to the cinematography of Anthony Dod Mantle. He often works with Lars von Trier and Danny Boyle and the images in ""Our Kind of Traitor"" feel woozy and submarine--hardly what we associate with this most clinical of genres. Indeed the whole film is oddly poised between the pensive and the peevish with a topdressing of high jinks. We get a cameo from le Carre himself as we did in ""The Night Manager"" and a good sly performance from Damian Lewis as Hector Perrys contact in London. (Hectors thick-rimmed glasses pay homage to Harry Palmer the agent played by Michael Caine in the nineteen-sixties.) Slowly though it is Skarsgard who takes charge positioning Dima--ruthless jovial and doomed--at the heart of this saturnine tale. Only in one respect is Dima a naif. Preserving faith in what he calls ""your famous fucking British fair play"" he even describes Perry as ""a gentleman."" In the world of le Carre that is like seeing a unicorn.

His latest cinematic adaptation opens in sleek very le Carre style--opulent European setting possibly sketchy exchange of goods cold-blooded assassination in the snow--before cutting to Marrakech where a shaggy poetry professor named Perry (Ewan McGregor) and his carefully composed wife Gail (Naomie Harris) are straining to reconnect. Their attempt at a romantic dinner falls flat but when Gail is called away for work a neighboring table of rowdy Russians invite Perry to join them. Soon Perry has a new best friend in the bighearted flamboyantly tattooed Dima (Stellan Skarsgard). Dima it turns out is a numbers guy but hes not on call at Hamp;R Block; he launders billions for the black market and hes desperate to extricate himself before his family becomes the target of a murderous new boss. Thats where the British secret service--and a trustworthy go-between like Perry--come in. Immersing an ordinary citizen in the criminal underworld and then turning up the heat is a timeworn trick and Traitor doesnt do anything particularly new with it. The film while gorgeously shot is schematic and wholly implausible. But Skarsgard saves it; wild and funny and ferociously alive hes a crucial bolt of color in all that tasteful gray.

In British television director Susanna Whites Cold-War-rekindled thriller ""Our Kind of Traitor"" Ewan McGregor plays a character named Perry Makepeace whose moniker is only slightly more subtle than those of classic Bond girls Pussy Galore Plenty OToole and Xenia Onatopp. A tweedy college professor roped into brokering the defection of Russias ""No. 1 money launderer"" Makepeace would appear to be making good on his name were this not the latest espionage thriller from cynic extraordinaire John le Carre who might have done better to christen his unwitting protagonist Patsy McGullible. Makepeace is vacationing with girlfriend Gail Perkins (Naomie Harris) in Marrakesh when he takes the bait accepting the invitation of boisterous Russian oligarch Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) to attend the sort of party where revelers dance among the fireworks and high-dollar prostitutes roam the halls on horseback. This is pretty much the lifestyle taxpayers figure Gerard Depardieu left France to enjoy and though it might have been fun to see the ""Marseilles"" star chew the scenery in the role Skarsgards turn as an overbearing open-collared Russian stereotype proves to be the films strongest asset. Still smarting from the sort of confidence-shattering indiscretion that serves to make their characters slightly less one-dimensional the couple left London to rekindle the proverbial spark. By accepting Dimas offer to hand-deliver a USB drive to British intelligence the excitement-averse academic inadvertently ignites far more thrusting them both into what sounds like a classic Hitchcock plot Ill-equipped everyman is yanked from a life of comfortable obscurity to save the world and/or clear his name. Perry figures he can turn the USB drive over at customs and be done with it though it turns out British intelligence wasnt what it once was. The dirty Russian money Dima has been laundering all these years seems to have found its way into some very prominent British pockets and as such semi-disillusioned MI6 agent Hector (played by ""Homelands"" shifty-looking Damian Lewis) must pursue his investigation with minimal manpower. Actually hes so short-staffed -- and yet so personally invested in bringing down a potentially corrupt rival -- that Hector manages to convince Perry and Gail to put their own lives on the line in order to bring Dima in. And so ""The Two Faces of January"" writer-director Hossein Aminis screenplay invites armchair espionage fans everywhere to imagine how they might navigate such a tricky negotiation tapping into their sense of chivalry and/or patriotism rather than that more urgent Hitchockian notion of misplaced guilt. In order to convey the stakes director White -- who leans on d.p. Anthony Dod Mantle to strike the balance between seduction and danger -- takes us into the inner circle of ""The Prince"" (Grigoriy Dobrygin) the ruthless Russian mobster who signs his enemies death sentence by presenting them with a cherished pistol only to have his goons collect it from their cold dead hands hours later. White depicts one such execution on a lonely stretch of icy road and the disturbing image of an entire family killed in cold blood haunts us as it does Dima. Outward flamboyance aside hes a committed family man which is perhaps the quality that convinces Perry (clearly atoning for his own shortcomings in that department) to stick his neck out for the near-stranger -- that and the free trip to Paris he and Gail get out of it. At Horaces urging the couple hops the Channel for a second romantic getaway this time playing cloak and dagger with Dima right under the noses of the men who intend to kill him -- including the dreamy blue-eyed Russian (Pawel Szajda) whod dispatched the aforementioned family. Perry and Gail are completely out of their depth in these scenes and White milks their naivete (and ours) by putting them in situations that could presumably turn fatal at any moment including a detour by retro-futuristic housing projects the Tours Aillaud where a tea break turns tense in an otherwise dead-end scene. Perry Makepeace may be virtually incapable of making violence but Dima has no such impediment and things heat up when the Russian starts to feel cornered. So many of Skarsgards past performances rely on his intellect that its a rare pleasure to see him slip into such a physical role whether hes puffing his chest to show off Russian prison tattoos or strangling one of the Princes thugs with his bare hands. By contrast McGregor is arguably too physical for his role which (as when he was cast as an uptight fisheries expert in ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"") really ought to have gone to a stuffier and far less handsome actor. But audiences come to movies like this -- a sort of latter-day ""Charade"" minus the mistakes of its less charming remake ""The Truth About Charlie"" -- fully expecting to enjoy the scenery. To that extent photogenic co-stars McGregor and Harris are as indispensable to the equation as the films exotic exteriors which range from the skylines of Paris and London to the Swiss Alps. Despite the real-world bombshell of the recent Panama Papers scandal Dimas secrets are too juicy for the general public to digest and this is where le Carres trademark skepticism distinguishes the web he weaves from that of any less venomous spider. Still the shattering of ones noble ideals is a delicate thing to capture on film and White plays the moment of rupture with a banality that threatens to undermine our faith in her as storyteller more than in the system itself. If Makepeace was meant to be our kind of hero its a shame to see him made out to be such a sucker. Film Review Our Kind of TraitorReviewed at Club 13 Paris March 18 2016. (In San Francisco Intl.

The latest is Our Kind of Traitor based on le Carres 2010 spy story. Like The Night Manager its a globetrotting story of ordinary people dragged into a high-stakes conspiracy that reveals our world to be run by snakes. Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris play Perry and Gail two pretty average Londoners on holiday in Marrakesh. One night in the hotel bar Perry befriends Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) a boisterous Russian mafioso who begs him to take information back to the UK and hand it over to British intelligence. Dimas USB drive contains details of British politicians helping Russian oligarchs launder money through London. In return for the scoop he wants to defect to Britain. Back home principled but bruised MI6 agent Hector (Damian Lewis) is sympathetic to Dimas cause but he struggles to get support for a mission from higher up. The idea of a wimpy British holidaymaker being drawn into a dangerous plot that hops from Paris to the Alps might have you rolling your eyes. However once you get past some bumps in the road of believability Our Kind of Traitor turns into a brisk energetic drama with Anthony Dod Mantles photography adding interesting layers to a fairly straightforward plot. In the hands of director Susanna White this is a less opaque film than some recent le Carre adaptations (especially 2014s murky A Most Wanted Man). But it still allows for some rich characterisation especially from Skarsgard as the larger-than-life Russian and Lewis as the British spook trying to put on a brave face. Most pointedly it leaves a lingering inescapable stench of corruption.

Based on about the only Le Carre book I havent read and boasting a first-class cast especially Lewis and Skarsgard I took my seat with high hopes. I was prepared to take the absurdity of a top Russian spy seeing a couple of boring Brits in a posh Marakesh restaurant (no such thing when I was last there in 1974) and persuading the husband to take a top-secret list back to British intelligence. Ewan McGregor plays his usual uncharismatic plodding nobody and the plot went from absurdity to impossibility. Skarsgard tries to make up for his characters implausibillity by bellowing swearing and shouting and with car chases plots and intrusive backgroung music it all descends into a total mess. Only redeeming feature is Lewiss creepy but sympathetic agent.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 29 2016MikeTFeaturedGiven Damien Lewis was in this I thought it was a good choice.  Like others below I feel it misses the mark.  Frankly as it also stars Naomi Harris I should have known better..I found the editing poor.  Either that or Skarsgard was twitching and quickly changing expression between shots in the same scene.  I didnt think he made for a convincing Russian.  His accent was terrible.  Also I found the incidental music very clumsy and obvious..If this were shown on TV Id switch to any channel showing the test card as thatd be infinitely more interesting..Avoid. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 27 2016John CtastemakerFeaturedA respectable John Le Carre adaptation. Just a little flat amp; uninspired.It does start to come to life near the end (thanks mainly to Daimian Lewis) - but its too little amp;  too late.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 24 2016JKFeaturedEntertaining but fairly routine thriller that never quite hits the mark. Skarsgard is excellent as the Russian mafioso who decides to defect but McGregor gives a bland and insipid performance as the everyman Englishman who is roped in to helping him. The rest is pretty much thriller by numbers with a denouement you can see coming a mile away. Not terrible by any means but not in the same league as Tinker Tailor.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/our-kind-of-traitor,200,traitor30,traitor,timeout
