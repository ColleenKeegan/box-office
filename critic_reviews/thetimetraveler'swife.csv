"The Time Travelers Wife | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    The Time Travelers Wife Print Page Email Page Search The Time Travelers Wife (2009; Rated ) C- "" Go buy the book. Please."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION The Time Travelers Wife(2009; PG-13)In theaters Friday 14 August 2009 Summary A romantic drama about a Chicago librarian with a gene that causes him to involuntarily time travel and the complications it creates for his marriage. Genre Drama Romance Science FictionDirector Robert SchwentkeCast Michelle Nolden Audrey Niffeneggers The Time Travelers Wife is one of my favorite novels of the decade but I cant say I was surprised by this earnest but lackluster and sometimes unintentionally funny screen adaptation. On the printed page when a 40ish naked man shows up in a meadow and charms a little girl its magical and you go with it. On the screen where its all so literal theres no way to avoid the creepiness. And thats just one of the many many many problems here. As is the case with every other movie in which time traveling is a central component you cannot avoid the scenes where characters are saying things like ""Let me see if I have this straight..."" even as the viewer is experiencing brain-freeze while trying to decipher the logic-bending developments unfolding onscreen. In ""The Time Travelers Wife"" Eric Banas Henry can skip back and forward in time----he can even talk to a younger version of himself----but he cannot alter events and he cannot control when he disappears. Theres also the matter of his clothes. As we learned in the original ""Terminator"" when you jump the time-space continuum your clothes cant make the trip with you so every time Henry time-travels his first order of business is finding shirt/pants/shoes/money. As an adult Henry skulks around Chicago unable to connect with society or forge a meaningful existence because theres always the chance he might disappear and wake up in 1987 or 1992. He drinks a lot even though drinking seems to trigger the time-travel mechanism. Apparently he has never even attempted to use his powers for the greater good. Hes just miserable waiting around for the next time when he finds himself naked and shivering on the streets of the city. But then theres Clare (Rachel McAdams as grownup Brooklynn Proulx as a little girl) who loves Henry unconditionally and brings meaning to his existence. The adult Henry travels back in time to prepare Clare for their meeting later in life which seems somewhere between unbelievably romantic and manipulative and cruel depending on your perspective. Much of ""The Time Travelers Wife"" focuses on Clares unbelievable patience and dedication as she remains true to Henry despite his disappearing act (including just before the wedding and just before the honeymoon) and the fact that she suffers multiple miscarriages possibly because their child carries the same genetic disorder Henry has. Bana and McAdams are of course two of the more attractive people on Earth but their chemistry doesnt approach the fireworks generated by McAdams and Ryan Gosling in the equally sappy but far less confounding ""The Notebook."" The script from Bruce Joel Rubin (""Ghost"") forgoes any effort to analyze Henrys condition save for a ridiculous discussion of Henrys condition as ""Chrono-Displacement Disorder."" The introduction of a child further muddies the waters and makes Henry Clare and child seem kookier and creepier than ""The Addams Family."" Maybe the source material was simply unworkable as a potential movie. Despite a few genuinely touching moments ""The Time Travelers Wife"" is far too confusing and beyond-loopy to succeed as a supernatural romance. Buy the book. Please.

As a sucker for time-travel romance (Ive considered joining the dewy-eyed souls who make yearly pilgrimages to the lake where Christopher Reeve went loop-de-loop for Jane Seymour in Somewhere in Time) Im over the moon about this movie which smooths out the psychological dissonances in Audrey Niffeneggers fine novel but is still an emotional workout. With no warning (though often when drunk or stressed) Eric Banas Henry is whisked back into the past or ahead to the future which would be more fun if he knew where he was going and his clothes went with him. At age 40 or so Henry leaps back in time and wins the heart of a girl named Clare played by lovely Brooklynn Proulx then Rachel McAdams. (Its a measure of my affection for this film that I didnt dwell on the standard implications of a naked fortyish man calling out from the bushes to a 6-year-old girl.) Ultimately theres no explanation for Henrys gift beyond a genetic abnormality and since he cant alter the pastbutterfly effect shmutterfly effectthe film is steeped in fatalism. It ends up evoking all our emotional waveringsthe ways in which we abandon lovers to relive the past or anticipate the future only sometimes connecting in the moment. Gracefully directed by Robert Schwentke the film has a perfect performance by Bana rangy and haunted never at home in his body. The sole jarring note is Henry and Clares first dance at their weddingto Broken Social Scenes Love Will Tear Us Apart. I might have suggested Love Will Keep Us Together. Passing Strange. The Broadway rock opera by Stew (just Stew) and Heidi Rodewald is captured on film by Spike Lee who sells the material hard but doesnt for once interpose himself. A full-throttle onstage band and a singing narrator (Stew again) chart the journey of an African-American youth called uh Youth (Daniel Breaker) as he searches for fulfillmentfirst with his mama (Eisa Davis) on the south side of L.A. (via church gospel then rock and roll) then in Amsterdam (sex drugs) then in Berlin (anti-bourgeois rants) then back home always leaving people who love him behind. The first act is camp but as the various artistic philosophies accumulate something magical happens This musical about the evolution of an artist becomes a metaphor for itself. When Stew (whos Youth grown up) lectures his younger self that life is a mistake that only art can correct the shows reason for being couldnt be more crystalline. The cutting is hyperkinetic yet Lee is always in synch with the casts phenomenal energy. Hes in their thralland so are we. The Headless Woman. Guilt and alienation from Argentinas Lucrecia Martel so arty enervated and allegorical it might have been made by a European in the early sixties. And yet the lead actress Maria Onetto holds you through the longueurs. The aging affluent dentist hits something with her carwe barely see it but we and she know what it isstops breathes closes her eyes and after an eternity drives away. Everything onscreen conspires to remind her of what she fled a deluge a digging gardener a dead animal on her kitchen counter. Under dry bleached-blond hair she blinks slowly her face placid her manner blandly abstractedbut you can feel her insides churning despair carried by acid reflux. District 9. Part pseudo-documentary part Kafkaesque conversion melodrama part astounding splatterfest. To call this the best shrimp-from-outer-space South African apartheid allegory ever made does not begin to do it justice. But its a start.

"Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams in The Time Travelers Wife. Slate Sign In Sign Up Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams in The Time Travelers Wife. Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams in The Time Travelers Wife. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 14 2009 535 PM The Time Travelers Wife I wish I could travel back to a time when I hadnt seen this movie. By Dana Stevens Physicist Dave Goldberg has a fascinating Slatepiece this week on how The Time Travelers Wife stacks up against other movies with a time-travel theme. In a survey of physicists speculations on the possibility of time travel he mentions one theory involving ""gargantuan cosmic strings [...] of matter of almost unimaginable density and length."" That about sums up The Time Travelers Wife adapted from Audrey Niffeneggers best-selling novel by Bruce Joel Rubin (who also wrote Ghost another metaphysically inflected love story). Ill take Goldbergs word that the movie obeys the laws of Einsteinian physics (no alternate universes you cant change history etc.) but its in flagrant violation of the rules of narrative logic character development or the most basic audience satisfaction. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) has a genetic disorder that causes him to disappear at random moments into parts of his own future or past. Henry has no control over when he travels where he goes or how long he stays there; he simply evaporates leaving a pile of empty clothes behind. (Its not easy to imbue the image of a collapsing pair of pants with pathos but director Robert Schwentke does his best.) Even the ever-renewed opportunity to see Eric Bana naked isnt enough to keep these repeated disembodiments from getting old fast. The fact that Henry seems to have no learning curve--his only takeaway from all this zipping through time is ""Dang Im powerless""--makes his character too passive to earn more from the audience than a vague sense of pity. Advertisement But The Time Travelers Wife isnt really a sci-fi tale of temporal displacement; its a domestic weepie about the abandonment Henrys wife Clare (Rachel McAdams) feels each time her husband pops off for an unannounced holiday in another dimension. Clares plight is that of an army wife times a thousand; when Henry vanishes she has no idea whether to set aside dinner for him that night or start looking for another mate entirely. The couples union seems to have been divinely predetermined by their first meeting in a meadow when Clare was 6 and a naked adult man suddenly began calling to her from the bushes asking if he could borrow her picnic blanket (in a scene thats not in any way horrifyingly suggestive of pedophilia). But their destiny doesnt make Henry less annoying to live with--though the DeTambles conjugal strife is significantly ameliorated by the fact that theyre stinking rich. (The already-well-off Clare wins 5 million in the lottery when Henry on a trip to the future memorizes the winning ticket number.) Theres something curiously off about The Time Travelers Wife. McAdams and Bana are charming and attractive actors capable of elevating the most banal material (cf. The Notebook in her caseand Troy in his) but both of them along with many of the supporting players (especially Ron Livingston as Henrys best friend Gomez) appear stiff and glazed. Long spans of time pass between lines of dialogue many of which seem to have been inexpertly translated from a foreign language so that they almost make sense but not quite. (""Its so good to see you"" a traveling Henry tells his future daughter played by the sisters Hailey and Tatum McCann.  ""Me too Dad"" she responds.) If as Henry does in the films opening scene I could pop in naked on my younger self to offer some wise counsel Id tell her to review District 9 this week and skip that screening of The Time Travelers Wife. And for Gods sake hand over that picnic blanket.

Its cozy sentimentality is the only thing that grounds it. Joe Neumaier Thursday August 13 2009 305 PM Title The Time Travelers Wife Its hard to live in stolen moments but trying to find a few enjoyable ones in ""The Time Travelers Wife"" is nearly impossible. The fact that this clumsy film of Audrey Niffeneggers popular fantasy novel is being dipped into theaters in mid-August is a clue to its quality. Timing after all is everything.Thats one of the things Henry (Eric Bana) learns as he pops in and out of existence. He first does it in childhood when he dematerializes sans clothes out of the car crash that has killed his mother and into an instant weeks earlier. Turns out he has a genetic ""chrono-impairment"" that keeps him unstuck in time.Flash-forward 15 years when Clare (Rachel McAdams) meets Henry in a library and announces that various versions of him have visited her since she was 6 telling her tidbits about the future shell have and the love coming her way. During Henry and Clares life together he spontaneously quantum leaps glimpsing what will happen to him though why remains a mystery.The cozy sentimentality in ""The Time Travelers Wife"" is the only thing that grounds it. Mostly its just featherheaded and even if youre not a stickler for consistency the movie makes and breaks its own mystical rules with irritating abandon.For instance Henry moves only between the times of his birth and death -- except for when he suddenly doesnt so a crucial event can be revealed. He talks to people he knows yet never to himself which would come in handy and another ""traveler"" does it fine. He chrono-skips when stressed though not always. Some of the bouncing Henrys but not every Henry know whats going on. And he cant change history except for a winning lottery card.Bana and McAdams generate no chemistry. Though Clare has talked to Henry many times since she was in grade school (he continually shows up naked in the shrubs which is creepy especially when it happens on their wedding night) McAdams while adorable makes Clare too much of a stickler; Henry cant control his jumps yet shes annoyed when he misses dinner. Bana had better moments this summer in ""Star Trek"" and ""Funny People.""Many movies -- from ""Somewhere in Time"" to ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" to ""Happy Accidents"" to ""The Lake House"" -- have had fun with unscientific time-twisting but the pretzel logic and half-baked execution here have a butterfly effect The dumber it gets the more you want it to disappear.

"The Time Travelers Wife - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMOVIE REVIEW The Time Travelers WifeOut of sync in love and storytelling An adaptation of the graceful romance hits the screen with an ungainly thud. Lack of chemistry is a big problem.August 14 2009|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC ""The Time Travelers Wife"" is a modern day fable of love in the face of a genetic anomaly that keeps tossing a guy named Henry naked and quivering in and out of his better halfs life at the most unpredictable and inconvenient of times.This happens first when young Clare is 6 and alone in a meadow and a 36-year-old naked stranger calls to her from behind the bushes. He asks for her blanket and wants to say ""Hi."" Now that is a very tough love-at-first-sight moment to pull off with the innocence that Audrey Niffenegger managed in the graceful book on which the film is based.It is also the first of many clues that adapting this romantic drama starring Eric Bana as the oft bare Henry and Rachel McAdams as the object of his affection might be far more difficult than director Robert Schwentke imagined.On the surface the story is a poignantly simple one with Henry given the wisdom and knowledge that normally comes only at lifes end. For him and Clare theres never a doubt that they are soul mates that their love will endure. Henrys seen it on his travels.That misplaced gene creates a case of life interruptus for Henry who is forever ping-ponging around various decades. His journeys have him bumping into his future and his past and Clare. As a result life unfolds in fragments often painful particularly for Henry who learns early on that while he might be able to see the future he cant change it. Since everything is so out of sync and with all those unplanned day trips Henry and Clare always have a lot to talk about which is more than you can say for a lot of married couples.There are other rich possibilities created by time travel which by its very nature upends many of the normal romantic conventions. When early in the film a grown-up Clare discovers Henry in the Chicago library where he works she knows they will marry; he doesnt even know theyll have dinner. All of which she explains over said dinner which may be why what should have been a steamy night for the lovely couple comes off as chaste. It turns out that love needs a little mystery.McAdams as Rachel is luminous with a dimple so deep Henry can drown in it. And Bana does naked quite effectively so even though the wife sometimes wishes he wouldnt travel so much most of the rest of us are hoping for more.On-screen the two of them are beautiful; in fact the entire look of the film thanks to cinematographer Florian Ballhaus (""The Devil Wears Prada"") is ethereally lush.Yet where there should be heat a cold wind blows. When the films fate rests on the alchemy of its stars you really dont want to get that wrong. But here chemistry is a problem and it proves a significant one. Instead of blazing passion flames igniting emotion bodies melting into each other our fireplace has but a few scattered embers covered in ash and barely glowing. That Ballhaus has created such saturated beauty on-screen makes it sadder still.And then theres the whole time-traveling issue. Its not so much that Henry disappears; its the way he disappears.In the book that seminal moment that conceit on which the entire story rests is described as a sort of tingling sensation that builds as your body disassembles then reassembles. Its never a soft landing either. You turn up naked confused in a place and time you know nothing about with not a penny to your name. It sounded intense.In the film it looks as though someone has taken a Photoshop eraser to Henry. The result is a dissolve that looks mechanical when it should look emotional. Its as if the CGI studio was locked that day.Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin (""Ghost"") has stripped the book to just the bare essentials of Henry and Clares story and softened some of the more wrenching moments though we do watch the couple go through the pain of multiple miscarriages.The film should have swept in and swept us off our feet with its grand romance and a story that is a welcome relief from the cliches of desperate girls chasing Neanderthal guys that has become Hollywoods default love story. Sadly McAdams facility as an actress is mostly wasted and you wish that Bana could have borrowed some of his haunting intensity from ""Munich.""But wishes arent enough and we never get the fairy-tale ending just a glimpse of what might have been.--betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--The Time Travelers WifeMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic elements brief disturbing images nudity and sexualityRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Cast makes About Time work in spite of time...October 31 2013Not all see the Wonder of Terrence Malick but his actors...September 12 2012To the Wonder frustrates Toronto audiences but should it?September 10 2012Movie review Morning GloryNovember 10 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTFilmHenryRachel McadamsCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-time-traveler14-2009aug14,0,348543.story",200,thetimetraveler'swife7,thetimetraveler'swife,latimes

The agent sent that chilling prediction in an explosive email to an analyst at FBI headquarters just 13 days before Sept. 11 it was revealed at congressional intelligence hearings yesterday. The FBI agent - who testified from behind a screen to shield his identity since hes still involved in sensitive cases - was expressing his anger at bureau lawyers who insisted on legal grounds that he was barred from looking at certain information on terrorist Khalid al-Mihdhar. The agents story is perhaps the most stunning example yet of how poor communication between the FBI and CIA hindered any chance of preventing 9/11. The federal crime fighter who was part of a team investigating al Qaedas deadly attack on the USS Cole said hes unsure what would have happened if hed gotten full support from his superiors and CIA cooperation. The FBI man said he hed been told by superiors to lay off al-Mihdhar because it would violate the legal ""wall"" that prevented overseas intelligence from being used in criminal prosecutions. After being turned down the New York agent wrote back to an analyst at FBI headquarters on Aug. 29 2001 ""Whatever happened to this - someday someone will die - and wall or not - the public will not understand why we were not more effective and throwing every resource we had at certain problems. "" The devastating email continued ""Lets hope the [FBIs] National Security Law Unit will stand behind their decisions then especially since the biggest threat to us now UBL is getting the most protection. "" UBL refers to Osama bin Laden whose name is spelled ""Usama"" by the feds. The FBI agent said he first learned about al-Mihdhar in the spring of 2001 through a source who claimed that someone bringing money to the chief suspect in the Cole attack had met with al-Mihdhar in Malaysia. When he became aware of the hijackers names after the attack the FBI agent told Congress ""I remember saying that this was the same Khalid al-Mihdhar that we had talked about for three months.""

""The Time Travelers Wife"" Movie Review -- Henry has a real problem being present in his marriage. Hes distant undependable -- sometimes in fact he seems miles away. His wife Clare knows she isnt the first woman to complain about that kind of distance in a relationship. Except in their case Henry really is miles away. The Time Travelers Wife (PG-13) Warner Bros. (104 min.) Directed by Robert Schwentke. With Eric Bana Rachel McAdams. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO STARS Rating note The film contains nudity violence and alcohol abuse. Hes often years away in fact because Henry through no plea or power of his own regularly becomes unstuck in time suddenly traveling into the future or the past sometimes for days. And Clare has to face being ""The Time Travelers Wife."" I will admit to a bias at the start. I am not one of the millions of people who read Audrey Niffeneggers bestseller when it was published in 2003. Also even as a sci-fi fan I tend to have problems with time-travel stories. This story for example features the usual migraine-inducing paradoxes with characters meeting themselves. It also never bothers to lay out its own logic. Can Henry only go into his own past or future? Or can he also go into realities that he was never a part of? Yes and yes. The movie of course wishes to work as a fantastic romance not as any kind of classic sci-fi story. Even its own pseudo-science is shaky and the one explanation it throws out (a rare ""genetic abnormality"") is hardly convincing. Yet its romantic underpinnings are shaky too. If the filmmakers wanted to set up time travel as a metaphor for the many things that can keep or drive couples apart that would be fine. But Henry has absolutely no control over his condition and Clare knows that when she marries him. So having her blame him for this problem later is a little like reviling a spouse for a disability which is cruelly unfair. German director Robert Schwentke gives the locales (mostly Toronto as usual substituting here for Chicago) a very European look. And Rachel McAdams of ""The Notebook"" is gently charming -- a helpful attribute when playing such a potentially unsympathetic heroine. As for Henry Eric Bana does a solid job although I got tired of his perpetually perfect stubble no matter what era hes transported to not to mention (as he time-travels in the nude) the endless shots of his backside. Female fans may be more forgiving. Occasionally the romantic scenes work. The story was adapted by Bruce Joel Rubin who also wrote ""Ghost"" and the parallels to that film (as well as the recent ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") are easy to spot. Theres a tragedy at work here not of this young couples making. But the whole thing feels arbitrary. Henry and Clares love is bedeviled not by anything theyve done or have any control over so the drama fails to build. The fault lies not in the heavens or in the characters themselves but in Henrys chromosomes. Perhaps he could get unstuck just one more time -- and go back and punch up the script.

Without warning he vanishes leaving clothes in a puddle at his feet.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted August 14 2009Im a time traveler. I come from the future. And I dont get to bring my clothes.""That about explains everything doesnt it?A kooky head-spinning romantic mess The Time Travelers Wife stars Eric Bana as the naked time traveler and Rachel McAdams as the bright-eyed Chicagoan who has known this guy since she was a little girl.Well she was a little girl. He was already a grown-up time-traveling dude - naked and hiding in the bushes. Didnt Clares parents tell her not to talk to weirdos lurking in the underbrush?A syrupy and extraordinarily ridiculous adaptation of Audrey Niffeneggers bestselling novel The Time Travelers Wife is about the timelessness of true love about the intersection of fate and chance and about how its possible to be in two places at once or to be in the same place twice and still not be able to show up for dinner.Acting is all about finding the ""truth"" in a character and a situation and delivering your lines with conviction - becoming the part. I kept thinking about Bana as his Henry goes caroming around from his young 20s to his mid-30s meeting up with Clare when shes a wee wide-eyed lass (played by the charming Brooklynn Proulx) or with McAdams Clare as she stumbles on Henry one day in the Chicago Public Library. Henry doesnt remember Clare then but that doesnt stop her from announcing that ""Ive known you since I was 6 years old"" and inviting him to meet at his favorite Thai eatery.How could the actor keep a straight face? How could she? Isnt there a point on the space-time continuum where mawkish hooey and moonstruck inanity collide to form an implosion of cosmic implausibility?With a screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin a veteran scribe with a special expertise in the spiritual and paranormal (see Ghost see Jacobs Ladder) and directed by the German-gone-Hollywood Robert Schwentke The Time Travelers Wife is astounding for the plodding leaden approach it takes to this wild woolly idea.Henry has a genetic defect you see a ""chrono-impairment"" that causes him to slip off without warning to other times other places. He leaves his clothes in a puddle at his feet and arrives wherever in his birthday suit. Its embarrassing for him sure but fine for the Australian hunks fans in the audience. (Its shocking the lengths Henry will go to clothe himself however once hes reached his new destination He smashes the windows of locked cars he burglarizes offices and shops. Is this any kind of message to send to our chrono-impaired youth?)I havent read Niffeneggers book so I could be wrong about this but The Time Travelers Wife might just be a clever bodice-ripping metaphor about boyfriends and husbands who cant commit to a relationship who will fly off at a moments notice dodging responsibilities and appointments with the in-laws.And parenting? Forget about it. Who needs to hang around raising a kid when you can go running through the trees as clothesless and carefree as a monkey with a time machine?Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Id watch the vibrant Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana in anything but The Time Travelers Wife is pushing it. Based on the chick-lit bestseller by Audrey Niffenegger the movie is Kryptonite for guys pulling out every tearjerking stop to make us believe in the undying passion between Clare (McAdams) an artist and Henry (Bana) the Chicago librarian shes loved since she was six years old and he appeared to her bare-assed in her familys garden. Does she pull out the mace and scream for daddy? No way. The charming utterly unthreatening Henry is a time traveler zipping around from past to present to future with no control over the where when why and how. And after each trip he ends up freezing his cojones in some alley but always gym-toned naked. The porn industry might have treated this premise with more blunt honesty. But director Robert Schwentke (Flightplan) is PG-13 circumspect with the script by Bruce Joel Rubin who won an Oscar for writing Ghost in 1990 and figures theres still gold to be mined from tales about dewy-eyed damsels in love with men who arent there. Clare seems incredibly uninterested in where Henrys ""chrono-impairment"" takes him. So is the movie. When Clare and Henry marry she makes a pretty fuss about how he keeps missing birthdays and holidays and how she cooked such a nice dinner and all. Sheesh do men really need to pay for a movie about guilt trips they can get for free at home? For the same effect dive nude into a tub of molten marshmallow.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Aug. 13 2009 343PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Time Travelers Wife Directed by Robert Schwentke Written by Bruce Joel Rubin Starring Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams Classification PG In sentimental fiction if not in sorry reality romances heart always pounds to the same reassuring three beats and the script is the trusty metronome that keeps time. Its rhythm never varies (1) introduce the problem; (2) complicate the problem; (3) resolve the problem. Well The Time Travelers Wife poses a doozy of a romantic problem but heres the weird thing Beyond that there are few complications. Seldom has the course of true love run more smoothly a happy fact thats good for the lovers in the film but bad for us. We need a romance with ruts deep enough to collect our puddled tears and put those tissues to weepy use. So ladies and any interested gents be advised Dont bother to stuff your purses or clutter your pockets - this is definitely a Kleenex-free zone. The source material for the film is that bestseller by Audrey Niffenegger a novel that boasts more dates than Paris Hiltons social calendar. Of course when a girl tumbles for a time-travelling guy for a bedmate with a habit of appearing today and then disappearing into the vast reaches of tomorrow-land chronology is a bit of an issue. Thats why the book takes great pains to keep his whereabouts straight constantly issuing italicized memos September 1977 or June 2000 or July 2053 . The movie does none of this choosing instead to clarify the story by streamlining the journey - shortening the travelled distances discarding key characters and focusing squarely on the central romance. Yet theres the dilemma. The streamlining does its job too well Gone is any potential confusion but gone too are the ruts the animating complications. The gadfly in question is a hunk named Henry (Eric Bana) a fellow with a ""rare genetic anomaly"" that hurls him sporadically and randomly through the space-time continuum. (Gee is that ""rare"" really necessary?) One moment hes fully clothed in the here and now; the next poof  hes stark naked in the there and then wearing nothing but the overnight stubble of any jet-lagged journeyer. Bana-philes will doubtless enjoy the discreet nudity while the rest of us repeatedly watching his frantic search for replacement duds are left to grapple with the forced comedy. Okay his airline may be unique but that lost-luggage joke gets stale fast. Still spare a little sympathy for Bana and some respect too. Only an actor with real gravity could prevent lines such as ""Im a time traveller I came from the future and I didnt get to bring my clothes"" from spiralling off into farcical orbit. Mainly what hes performing here is an impressive feat of damage control. Rachel McAdamss role as the faithful wife however is a thankless role at best and pretty near impossible with these sci-fi encumbrances. Clare first meets her beloved in a sunny meadow when shes a fearless girl of 6 - a prepubescent Eve whose Adam pops up in the gardens green thickets. As the adult Clare and the non-commuter in this long-distance relationship her sole mission is to carry the torch through Henrys many vanishing acts - a task McAdams executes with a plastered-on smile as constant as her love. Now metaphorically all this might have been an elaborate yet intriguing take on the commitment-phobic male forever offering his heart only to withdraw it disappearing behind a cold wall of reticence. But neither the book nor the film is interested in metaphor. Rather director Robert Schwentke steers a determinedly literal-minded course and amours only impediment is Henrys quirky DNA. Occasionally his twitchy hold on the present is played for tepid laughs giving new meaning to wedding-day jitters (will the groom take a powder at the altar?) and fresh certainty to winning the lottery (time-travelling does whisk the gamble out of gambling). Mainly though the impediment is mined for emotion with few recovered nuggests. Thats hardly surprising for the simple reason that Henrys magical ailment contains the seeds of its own magical cure Whenever a complication arises such as the wifes wish to give birth or the husbands appointment with death the plot can simply time-travel to the solution. So like that rigged lottery ticket romance is robbed of its gamble stripped of its suspense shorn of its mystery and deprived of an ending that feels earned. Its little wonder that our hankies stay dry. The Time Travelers Wife slips the romance cards into a stacked deck - read em if you will but no need to weep.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Time Travelers Wife Romantic drama. Starring Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams. Directed by Robert Schwentke. (PG-13. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It would really help to get into the right frame of mind before seeing ""The Time Travelers Wife"" because viewed from some angles - maybe most angles - the movie is ridiculous. As a time-travel movie its a bust because our hero only gets to visit a small span of history (about 40 years) has no ability to alter events and has no particular interest in any of the places he sees. As a movie dealing with a scientific phenomenon its disappointing in that it violates its own logic in a number of places. And simply as a spectacle the movie flirts with becoming unintentionally funny The gimmick is that each time our hero (Eric Bana) gets zapped to another time and place he arrives naked. Take those elements and add in something else - a tone of absolute mournful super-seriousness - and you have a ripe target for satire. Still anything earnest risks being mocked and the reflexive irony of our time is nothing to brag about. The truth is ""The Time Travelers Wife"" in its clumsy way does something significant. It takes as its subjects the sadness and grandeur of life and the mystery of time and it offers a full experience to those who find its wavelength. Time travel is a natural topic for movies. Take a moving picture camera and point it at anything absolutely anything. Then wait a year or two or 50 or 100. Eventually those images will become heartbreaking to somebody. Its the nature of the medium. In the same way ""The Time Travelers Wife"" makes us aware of the ephemerality and preciousness of all things. So a boy is in a car with his mother in the opening scene and theyre talking about nothing in particular - always a bad sign. It means you guessed it a fatal car crash is on the way. Mom is killed and the boy survives. Hes on the street moments later shocked and grief stricken when Eric Bana suddenly materializes. He tells the boy that he is him as an adult and that ""everything is going to be all right."" So in a matter of 30 seconds the boy loses his mother but finds out that hell eventually look like Eric Bana. Call that breaking even.

Review Time Travelers Wife 1 / 3 Back to Gallery For Henry (Bana) time travel is an affliction. Like everyone else he moves through life one moment to the next but every few days or weeks he is involuntarily detoured sent catapulting back to an earlier or later period. This is the given and the strength of the movie is how much emotion it can wring from that simple premise. Theres a scene for example in which Henry finds himself on a Chicago subway train some time in the early 1970s. He looks over and sees his mother (Michelle Nolden) sitting there reading the paper - on some random commute on some forgotten day. The scene that follows is simple but beautiful. Most of ""The Time Travelers Wife"" deals with the relationship between Henry and the woman he marries Claire whos played by Rachel McAdams. Based on the novel by Audrey Niffenegger the film is less interested in the specifics of time travel than the effect time travel might have on a marriage. McAdams undergoes the biggest transformation calibrating Claires journey from hopeful girlhood to romantic young womanhood to middle-aged doubt fear and disappointment. But its Bana who carries the films emotion. Hes aided enormously by Bruce Joel Rubins screenplay - the author of ""Ghost"" and ""Jacobs Ladder"" is a natural for this material - and by a director Robert Schwentke who knows when to put the camera on Banas face and leave it there. I used to assume that Bana was just a handsome guy which is reason enough that he should be in movies. But two weeks ago ""Funny People"" proved he had something more going on and now ""The Time Travelers Wife"" defines what that something is. Just look at him in those close-ups in which he lies He knows the truth he knows the future but he decides not to burden the other person with this terrible knowledge. In those moments he doesnt move a muscle but his eyes just ... change. They darken literally. This is not an intellectual talent and this is no acting trick. This is a guy who has an ability to open up to be unguarded to feel something without getting in his own way. Among actors this ability is uncommon. Among male heartthrobs its almost unheard of. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations and violence.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Audrey Niffeneggers much-praised bestseller The Time Travelers Wife hardly seemed like a good contender for adaptation to film. As genetic oddity Henry DeTamble inadvertently and unwillingly jumps through time he and the love of his life Claire create a complicated asynchronous history She first meets him when shes six years old he first meets her much later in his life. Theyre endlessly out of sync and struggling to bridge their emotional gaps. The resulting complicated masterfully created tangle of timelines didnt seem likely to make it to the screen intact. But after a lengthy troubled production history including a year on the shelf the film is finally hitting theaters. And in the hands of director Robert Schwentke (Flightplan) and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost Deep Impact) the problem isnt the timeline--its everything else. The issues begin with Eric Bana who plays Henry as a flat one-note character. The books version of Henry is a tragic larger-than-life man with huge appetites for food sex alcohol music and normalcy; Banas version is flavorless and strangled a guy whose affliction seems to have stripped away his personality leaving only vague peevishness behind. When he first meets Claire (Rachel McAdams) hes a veteran time-traveler who still seems incapable of understanding how she could know him when he doesnt know her. And his woeful pissy bafflement is symptomatic of a character--and a film--lacking in imagination. McAdams by contrast tries far harder to bring a sense of charm and energy to Claire but since the film elides over most of their relationship-building in order to cut to the drama when things go wrong between them she all too often comes across as a shallow brat. The many scenes packed with awkward pauses and clumsy line-readings hamper the film irrecoverably but even stellar actors might have stumbled amid the films portentous tone which ratchets up the intensity at the cost of sincerity. Nearly every overplayed melodramatic moment seems unearned especially once Schwentke underlines it all with treacly music to drive the point home. The story is still mostly fabulous and its novelty helps carry the film but this still comes across like a poor high-school stage version sincere and kind of sweet but endlessly clumsy.

By Peter Rainer August 14 2009 Save for later Saved Rachel McAdams as Clare left and Eric Bana as Henry in New Line Cinemas romantic drama ""The Time Travelers Wife"". Alan Markfield/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Ill let you in on a little secret that film critics have known for years. A major studio production released in August with top-list stars is almost certain to be a gobbler. Case in point ""The Time Travelers Wife"" based on a bestselling novel by Audrey Niffenegger that one assumes makes a mite more sense than the movie that has been melted down from it.Eric Bana plays Henry the eponymous time traveler who was born with a genetic defect enabling him against his will or conscious intervention to flit back and forth in time. Whenever he passes into another zone he rapidly dissolves into thin air leaving his clothes behind in a heap. This means hes buck naked whenever and wherever he reappears. You would think that the director Robert Schwentke and the screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin (""Ghost"") would try to milk a few laughs out of Henrys predicament but laughs are not on the menu here. Neither is logic thrills or romance. Henrys wife Clare played by Rachel McAdams wears out her smile muscles trying to put up with a husband who at any moment can suddenly vanish only to reappear sometime later as a younger or older version of himself. Again this could have been the basis for some terrific comedy - talk about errant husbands - but the filmmakers are after bigger mythic game. They miss by a mile - or should I say a light-year.

The latter phenomenon occurs here in this modestly appealing screen adaptation by Robert Schwentke (Flightplan) of the best-selling 2003 novel by Audrey Niffenegger. Something like Groundhog Day as penned by Henry James the time-travelling conceit as presented onscreen (it worked better in the book) makes for an awkward hybrid. Article Continued BelowIts a goofy premise built more for comedy than drama especially when the clock-shocking Romeo is constantly arriving in public places as naked as a jaybird. Eric Bana is Henry a Chicagoan we meet at age 6 as hes being magically transported away from a fateful car accident. As young Henry shivers on the snowy roadside hes consoled by an older version of himself who suddenly appears to tell him that everythings going to be all right.Its the first instance and definitely not the last where The Time Travelers Wife violates the standard sci-fi laws of time travel. To wit you cant talk to your younger or older self (the space-time continuum would explode silly); you cant alter the past or future; and you mustnt tell people about how their lives are going to change.Henry does all these things even while explaining why he cant or wont do these things which makes for much confusion. More for the audience than for Clare (Rachel McAdams) who first meets Henry as a young girl while shes gambolling on a field straight out of a Monet painting while Henry is hiding his naked form in shrubbery.As both child and adult Clare accepts rather blithely and occasionally resentfully that Henry has a mysterious ailment called ""Chrono Displacement"" that causes him to disappear for days or weeks at a time while he skips across the decades (mostly the 1970s through 2000s.)""Yeah its a problem"" she says.Not an insurmountable one however as the couple manage to fall in love regardless of Henrys habit of not only vamoosing but also reappearing as younger and older versions of himself (but without the Benjamin Button extremes.) It makes for a baffling wedding photo when the groom looks to be first in his early 20s and then his late 40s and back again.Others get into Henrys time-shuttling groove their close pal Gomez (Ron Livingston) Henrys dad Richard (Arliss Howard) and obliging egghead Dr. Kendrick (Stephen Tobolowsky) who coins the ""chrono impairment"" diagnosis.Its amazing what humans can get used to but theres a downside to this familiarity. The Time Travelers Wife settles into a dull pattern of Henrys comings and goings with no rhyme or reason to them. Could he alter his flight plan? Maybe if he stops drinking starts singing or stops being stressed. Or maybe not.The whole thing would amount to little more than a (vanishing) hill of beans where it not for the strong connections between Bana and McAdams who rise above the shaky material with performances worthy of the Oscar contender this movie aches to be (that Mychael Danna score is certainly gorgeous).Whats missing from the film is any real sense of purpose apart from Henrys and Clares squabbling efforts to have a child in the here and now and not the there and then (Ally McBeals phantom dancing fetus comes to mind). Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin also penned Ghost which managed to incorporate a genuinely exciting drama in the context of a supernatural love saga. Was similar inspiration lacking here or was he required to stick too closely to the source novel?The novel at least provided regular updates as to the years and the changing ages of Henry and Clare signposts that are sorely lacking in the film.If you can get past the calendar gymnastics The Time Travelers Wife plays as an affecting allegory of love that persists even when the lover is gone - as in really gone. Its also gorgeous to look at; Toronto makes a great Chicago.And it certainly fits the current mood of moviegoers. Todays romancers seem to want a little conjuring with their canoodling. Is real-world love simply too mundane?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

It sends him reeling forward and backward in time without rhyme without reason without warning--and without clothes. Theres a fair bit of light fiction that plays much more winningly on screen than between book covers. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is one such example. Some pop lit clips along reasonably well on the page but on screen reveals itself for the claptrap it truly is. Here ""The Da Vinci Code"" springs immediately to mind. Let me come clean right off and say that I have not read Ms. Niffeneggers book. Perhaps its just one of those novels that defies translation to the screen. Or perhaps what we have here is yet one more instance of Hollywood taking a poignant nuanced page-turner and turning it into a tale told by a nitwit signifying absolutely nothing but providing many unintentional laughs. This of course is a matter best left to the authors myriad fans who bless them are probably already lining up at the cineplex. ENLARGE Rachel McAdams as the title character in The Time Travelers Wife Warner Bros. In any case the turgid screen adaptation of ""The Time Travelers Wife"" stars Eric Bana as Henry the accidental ecdysiast and Rachel McAdams as Clare the long-suffering but patient-as-Penelope title character. The two first meet when Clare is a 10-year-old having a picnic in a meadow and naked-as-a-jaybird Henry is hiding in the bushes for reasons of modesty and a PG-13 rating. Clare gives Henry her blanket and her heart. Through the years if I can make any sense of this nonsense he makes periodic visits back to the meadow solidifying the intensity of her feelings. Now an adult Clare is finally in the same time zone as Henry and wants to make a life with him. But what kind of future can she expect with a time-travelin man? And heres the thing Henry is just such an uninteresting time traveler. Unlike other fictional characters blessed--or cursed--with the gift of shuttling off to last year or next decade he never witnesses great moments in history or in the distant future never meets anybody of note. Unfortunately hes also incapable of altering the course of events. He just toddles off leaving a heap of clothes on the floor (so like a man) to show hes good and gone. Dont count on him for dinner or New Years Eve. Mr. Bana who seems to have two modes of acting shaven and unshaven and the ill-used Ms. McAdams dont generate much heat. But clearly the two of them are suffering mightily. Their situation is hopeless and so is their dialogue. ""I come from the future"" says Henry. ""You forced yourself into the mind and heart of a little girl"" says Clare. Heres the take-home message Love conquers all and time is fleeting. Viewers will likely think otherwise. The movie moves at such an agonizingly stately pace that by the end side effects be damned Henrys time-traveling gene starts to look mighty appealing. Ponyo ENLARGE A goldfish transformed into a little girl scampers over the waves in Ponyo. Disney It doesnt get screen credit but the big beautiful and often temperamental star of Hayao Miyazakis latest animated charmer ""Ponyo"" is the ocean. In this loose adaptation of Hans Christian Andersens ""The Little Mermaid"" (no relation to Disneys ""Little Mermaid"") typhoon-tossed waves--in terrific two-dimensional renderings--morph suddenly into dolphins that dissolve back into water then back once again into fish. Brunhild a mischievous strong-minded goldfish (the voice of Noah Cyrus Mileys younger sister) is determined to become a little girl when shes rescued from a jar and befriended by Sosuke (the voice of Frankie Jonas the Jonas Brothers kid brother) a plucky self-reliant 5-year-old. He feeds his new pal ham (oh ever so much better than plankton) becomes the most diligent of protectors and dubs her Ponyo. Sosukes mother (the voice of Tina Fey) an administrator at a senior center is perfectly tolerant about the whole thing (even though Ponyo as a little girl is a bit of a hyperactive handful). Not so Brunhilds father (the voice of Liam Neeson) a dissipated-looking sorcerer with a ringmasters coat streaming seaweed hair and a harried expression (possibly because hes the single parent of hundreds of impish little daughters possibly because of the wreck that environmentally careless human beings have made of the underwater world and the world above). If the plot of ""Ponyo"" is small as a minnow its themes--the relationship between parent and child between the young and the elderly between friends between man and nature--are large and fully realized. District 9 Major urban centers like Manhattan and Washington are popular destinations for alien spacecraft in science-fiction movies. But in the often inventive apartheid parable ""District 9"" directed by Neill Blomkamp a protege of ""Lord of the Rings"" auteur Peter Jackson the spacecraft in question lands in Johannesburg. ENLARGE Sharlto Copley is armed and ready in District 9 TriStar Pictures Its been 20 years since the vehicle stalled out above the city. Its passengers--a teeming mass of creatures resembling arachnids that eat cat food and speak in a guttural patois that requires subtitles--are coralled into a shantytown. There they are shunned by the dregs of the dregs of society viewed with suspicion by the government and derisively nicknamed ""prawns."" Prawn spawn are routinely aborted. The local human population is relieved to hear at long last of plans to move the prawns to a new camp many kilometers outside the city. But amid the complicated attempts at relocation Wikus van de Merwe (the very good Sharlto Copley)--an officious bureaucrat in way over his head--is hit by a virus that starts turning him into an alien. This makes him a prawn of great interest to a sinister corporation and threatens to break up his marriage. Its also the catalyst for loyal company man Wikus to examine his own prejudices and rock-bound belief system. ""District 9"" begins in cinema verite style with a collection of talking heads--one speaker is identified as ""the head of alien relations"" another as an entomologist yet another as a human-rights activist--to bring viewers up to speed. Earnestly they meditate about such troubling social issues as prawn gangs and ""interspecies prostitution."" Theres a wonderfully sly farcical verve to these early moments but it dissipates when the script with its strains of ""E.T."" and ""The Fly"" moves into high sci-fi gear. DVD FOCUS Portrait of Jennie (1948) Joseph Cotten is Eben Adams a starving disillusioned New York artist in this fantasy. Walking through Central Park one day he meets Jennie Appleton a pretty voluble young girl whos wearing puzzlingly old-fashioned clothing and who leaves behind a decades-old newspaper the first of many clues that shes of another time and another world. The bedazzled Eben makes a sketch of Jennie then paints what becomes a celebrated portrait--hes found his muse and lost his heart--but every time he sees his mysterious subject she seems to have aged a few years. Time After Time (1979) Its the London of 1893 and the police are hot on the trail of Jack the Ripper who has just struck again in Nicholas Meyers terrific whirligig. Their search takes them to the home of H.G. Wells (Malcolm McDowell) where a dinner party is in progress and where the author is about to unveil a real-life version of the time machine he immortalized in his novel ""The Time Machine."" The constables believe that Wellss physician friend may be the killer but before they can nab him he hops into his hosts curious device and escapes almost a century into the future with H.G. making determined chase. Spirited Away (2001) Chihiro a sulky 10-year-old girl is moving with her family to a new town in Hayao Miyazakis magical fantasy an Oscar winner for best animated feature. They take a wrong turn and the shortcut chosen by Chihiros father leads down a pathway inhabited by spirits then to what seems like an abandoned amusement park. There the girls parents feast greedily on the marvelous offerings at a food stand and are turned into pigs. Now Chihiro must navigate this weird new world and come up with a way to free her parents from the clutches of a powerful witch. --Joanne Kaufman For television listings visit LocateTV.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Time Travelers Wife  (out of four)Stars Rachel McAdams Eric Bana Ron Livingston Arliss HowardDirector Robert SchwentkeDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13 for thematic elements brief disturbing images nudity and sexualityRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Time Travelers Wife is a slog rather than the sweeping romance it aspires to be. Meant to be grand in the irresistibly starry-eyed vein of 1980s Somewhere in Time or 1990s Ghost instead its dull and sappy. The problems start with the script. The movie adaptation of Audrey Niffeneggers best-selling 2003 novel is convoluted and mired in minutiae which prevents the viewer from getting caught up in the decades-long love story. Even the title is a misnomer. The tale is more focused on Henry (Eric Bana) who has a genetic anomaly that causes him to be suddenly transported to another time than it is on his wife Clare (Rachel McAdams). Clare meets the adult Henry when she is 6 years old. She explains that he quickly became her best friend and secret crush. Though the time-travel narrative is supposed to capture the progression of a life-long love its disconcerting to watch a pre-pubescent girl have recurring meetings with a grown man who suddenly appears in her familys garden out of nowhere. And hes stark naked. Mindful of the seeming impropriety Henry attempts to be modest and land behind some thick shrubbery on his visits. Soon Clare begins leaving her fathers old clothes at the outskirts of her familys estate in preparation for Henrys surprise stopovers. When they are both roughly the same age they meet again. Clare now an artist has eagerly anticipated this day. They marry and try to have a semblance of a normal life even as Henry continues to skip back and forth between the years with virtually no control over his comings and goings. We learn that there are certain ""triggers"" to his peripatetic condition. His flights can be exacerbated by stress -- what isnt these days? -- and can catch him unaware if he is overtired. Even sci-fi romances apparently are grounded in the mundane realities of our contemporary society. But his flights are nonetheless a problem and expose him to a wide range of dangers. Though Bana and McAdams make a lovely couple and do their level best to strike up sparks their romance is lost among the complex comings and goings and the arcane rules and limitations of time travel. The Time Travelers Wife tries to transcend time and place but it ultimately becomes bogged down in details.

Starring Rachel McAdams Eric Bana Ron Livingston Director Robert Schwentke Running time 148 Release Opened Aug 14 2009  Editorial Review Going the Distance to Stir the Heart By John AndersonSpecial to The Washington PostAugust 14 2009Not that we needed any more evidence but the perversity of mankind can be illustrated by what we find most romantic in our popular entertainment Namely thwarted romance. Theres nothing that jerks a tear like two people head over heels who cant be together -- Catherine and Heathcliff because of death; Rick and Ilsa because of Hitler; Will and Grace because of . . . well you know what we mean.In ""The Time Travelers Wife"" German director Robert Schwentkes adaptation of Audrey Niffeneggers novel (with a script by Bruce Joel Rubin of ""Ghost"") the lovely Rachel McAdams returns -- not to the madcappery of what is probably her biggest movie (""Wedding Crashers"") but to the genre of her most beloved movie ""The Notebook."" In that film her character is kept from the man she loves (at least temporarily) by issues of class.In ""The Time Travelers Wife"" in which she plays the title role the issue is time Her true love Henry (Eric Bana) is afflicted by a ""rare"" (i.e. ridiculous) genetic abnormality that causes him to abruptly leave the present tense for eras unknown returning who knows when and in what kind of shape.Its the kind of mutant disorder that makes a committed relationship an impossibility Tell him to take out the garbage and he ends up in the 60s.In a sense ""The Time Travelers Wife"" is about men who leave which doesnt make it particularly novel. But in another sense the difficulties of being Henry and Clare serve as a metaphor for the obstacles to love that pop up in every relationship. And just as every woman seemed to find her own mother in ""The Joy Luck Club"" every lover will find a commonality with ""The Time Travelers Wife."" As such it will worm its way into the hearts of anyone vulnerable to stories about ill-fated romance and star-crossed love. Most people one would guess.What makes ""The Time Travelers Wife"" work as drama though and certainly better than it might have is an unhesitating emotional commitment on the part of the actors (and Schwentke). They are in total allegiance to a conceit which had there been any semblance of doubt or ironic detachment would have been rendered preposterous. To their credit Bana and McAdams give it their all regardless of plausibility never wavering from the plot at hand and delivering in quasi-profound fashion what might have easily been a comedy.Not that the circumstances arent grim When we first meet Henry his mother is being killed in a car crash from which he has miraculously been snatched by his genetic quirk. We meet Clare (played by McAdams as a grown-up and by the winning Brooklynn Proulx as a girl) as she is meeting a considerably older Henry after he is dropped into the shrubbery around the meadow where she lives in need of a sympathetic ear and some pants. (Henry is swept out of his clothes and deposited naked in each time period he visits providing many of the movies situational giggles.) Clare falls in love with Henry of course but has to wait to meet him when they are both of a similar age.And whats more romantic that the concept of waiting? Where would the history of popular love songs be without the concept of one lover saving him- or herself for the other? In that respect ""The Time Travelers Wife"" is as pure as the driven mush. And so from a marketing perspective its a chick flick disguised as science fiction -- which presumably will mean girls can get guys to go see it.Only time will tell but there seems no question that tears will flow and hankies will suffer terribly. The mind may boggle at the inconsistencies and logistical impossibilities posed by all of Henrys disappearances and tampering with the past and his crisscrossing travels with his alternate selves. Einstein and H.G. Wells would have a few problems with this movie. Nora Ephron probably not.Contains sexuality nudity and violence.

Pictures Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams in ""The Time Travelers Wife."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Science fiction and soap opera collide in ""The Time Travelers Wife"" in which Eric Bana suffers existential commitment issues. Because of a ""genetic anomaly"" he involuntarily evaporates from the present for minutes or weeks at a time then randomly reappears from the past or future. Rachel McAdams in the title role is understandably irked. Exploring an emotional bond over time but not in chronological order is the hot theme this season. Both ""(500) Days of Summer"" and ""Julie amp; Julia"" rely on flashbacks (and forwards) to tell their tales. Here screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin (an Oscar winner for ""Ghost"") adapts Audrey Niffeneggers novel without straining to make the setup plausible. The only way to watch the movie is with complete willing credulity. The movie is more about love than metaphysics. Rubin concentrates on creating winning characters and romantic chemistry. This is trickier than it might appear. Bana first appears in McAdams life when she is 6 and he is a man of 30 -- a naked man of 30. You see time travelers vanish out of their clothes and appear at their destination starkers. Bana speaking from behind a bush persuades the child to lend him her picnic blanket. Because she is growing up on her parents estate with no experience of threatening outsiders she doesnt bolt screaming ""Stranger danger"" Instead the pair strike up a friendship that warms over subsequent visits; eventually he spills the beans about their future relationship. Its a tribute to Bana and the young actress Brooklynn Proulx that these encounters feel charming and innocent even though he is inserting himself into the imagination of an impressionable child as a mystical superbeing who is her inevitable lover. When they cross paths years later (in linear time) McAdams is flustered and delighted to encounter her ideal man just as he foretold. Bana however is off-balance; he hasnt yet reached the age when he began visiting the little girl. This is one of the few passages in which the film ponders the sorts of paradoxes anachronisms deja vu and revelations common to time-travel stories. Bana and McAdams relate to each other and their friends (who are in on his malady) as a nice charming couple with an inconvenient quirk not guardians of an astonishing secret. They lead a normal life of meeting mating marrying dinners decorating and child-rearing interrupted by Banas time-warp walkabouts. The appeal of the story is its promise that love is a force that overpowers the laws of the universe that we can defy time rather than letting it defeat us. But the energy level the storytelling momentum needed to drive that idea home is absent. The attraction between the leads is only Hallmark-postcard level romance. You dont believe that they share an invincible love that can batter a loophole in reality hold death and loss at bay. THE TIME TRAVELERS WIFE  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic elements brief disturbing images nudity and sexuality. ""The Time Travelers Wife"" is an uninspired alternative to comic book pandemonium and solemn family dramas a gloppy serving of late summer corn.

"Time Travelers Wife The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; time-traveler-s-wife-the ) Time Travelers Wife The (United States 2009) August 13 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Time Travelers Wife is a conventional adaptation of an unconventional novel. Thats not necessarily a bad thing - screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin and director Robert Schwentke (Flightplan) impose structure on a story that in Audrey Niffeneggers long and complex book cartwheels freely through time. The film version plays like a ""best hits"" compilation shoehorning in most of the key events while glossing over subplots and subtleties that are explored in depth on the written page. But thats the way it is with motion picture adaptations and although this is not the best one its more than respectable and provides the romance humor and pathos demanded by fans of the genre. The prominence of ""time traveler"" in the title might lead the viewer to believe this is a science fiction film but its nothing of the sort. At best the chronological impairment can be considered a plot device - a fantasy conceit employed to enhance the love storys flavor. Ultimately The Time Travelers Wife succeeds not because it toys with things like time travel paradoxes (which it does albeit not mind-bendingly) but because as in all good romances we learn to care about the characters and want them to experience happiness with each other. Henry (Eric Bana)is a time traveler although not by will. He cant control when it happens or where he will go (although he is frequently drawn to specific geographical and/or chronological points that have a particular resonance in his life) but the condition has afflicted him since age five when he nearly died in a car accident that claimed his mothers life. Since clothing cannot travel with Henry he appears naked at his destination so finding garments is always job 1. Henry has been visiting Clare (Rachel McAdams) since she was a little girl - they first cross paths when she is six - but their encounter at a Chicago library when she is 21 is the first meeting for him and the umpteenth for her. She has long since fallen hopelessly in love with him so its natural for her to open her heart to him and join him in bed. Its a different story for Henry who is stunned and awed by the way this woman comes into his life like a force of nature. It is fated it seems for them to become man and wife but Henrys frequent unpredictable travels (often into Clares past) put a strain on their union especially when he disappears on a two week excursion. The screenplay keeps from losing coherence by anchoring itself to a ""present"" timeline associated with Clares adult life. Henrys trips are shown in relationship to that fixed period and since there are fewer than in the novel the potential for confusion is reduced. It isnt hard to follow The Time Travelers Wife even considering the various Henrys that appear throughout Clares past and the mobius strip that represents his lifeline. Theres something incredibly compelling about love being a lifelong concept as only time travel can make it. These two characters discover each other in different ways at different times and theyre never quite on an equal footing until the end. This is of course not the first recent movie to use time travel as a romantic ingredient. The 2006 film The Lake House postulated that two people separated by years might fall for each other via letters they deposit in a time traveling mailbox. The Time Travelers Wife doesnt necessarily make more sense (no attempt is made to explain Henrys ability beyond stating that its a genetic disorder sharing similarities with epilepsy) but it sounds less silly and plays out more credibly. The suspension of disbelief barrier isnt as high. And while there are plenty of weepy moments in The Time Travelers Wife theres also a fair bit of humor. Consider for example the clever way in which Henry resolves what could have been a disaster on the day of his wedding and the way some of the others - especially Clare - react to it. The casting is solid. Eric Banas low-key style proves effective for Henry who is by nature a reserved and introverted character (until Clare he is afraid of becoming close to anyone). Rachel McAdams who earned her romantic movie credibility in The Notebook is luminous. Her spirit and energy form the perfect counterpart to Banas reticence. Interestingly its not only Bana and McAdams chemistry that sells the pairing but the more parental bond that forms between Bana (as the adult Henry) and Brooklynn Proulx who plays Clare at six and eight. Dont worry - its not as creepy as it might seem. (In the book Henry is firm about their not being any overt sexual contact until Clare is eighteen. In the movie they wait that long to kiss.) The best thing about The Time Travelers Wife is that the romance feels organic rather than manufactured. This isnt like The Proposal where love magically materializes. Here it literally grows over time. Also the film honors its source material without being slavishly constrained by it. The movies epilogue although different from the one in the book retains the storys tone. Its hard to imagine Niffenegger fans being upset by this film. The book is richer but this is a solid endearing telling of the same essential story and is well worth the price of admission for those who appreciate romantic fantasy.

Only instead of being milked for elaborate science-fiction thrills the problem at hand gets treated as a weepy and grandiose inconvenience. Sort of like the metaphysical version of having a husband who takes too many business trips. Henry (Eric Bana) is deeply and eternally in love with Clare (Rachel McAdams) and ?she with him. The only problem is that he has a ""genetic anomaly"" that causes him to skip around through time without warning. All of a sudden he will melt out of the present and pop up...somewhere else in the future or in the past without a stitch of clothing on so that he must scramble for cover and regain his bearings. Then just as suddenly hell pop back into Clares life -- sometimes when hes too young a man to have any idea who she is. (A little confused? So was I.) More jarringly he sometimes appears when hes an adult and shes an adoring young girl standing in a ? pastoral meadow. Thats when she falls in love with him -- which is meant to be innocent but comes off as a bit unintentionally creepy. I mean is the movie supposed to look like a contemporary version of The Lewis Carroll Story? To muddle matters further Henry is seen at assorted ages but except for the moment when he shows up at his wedding with sudden streaks of gray in his hair Bana looks exactly the same in every scene. The Time Travelers Wife is built as a game that the audience learns to play and after a while yes we do get the hang of it. That is we accept the films mixture of the playful ?and the slightly arbitrary; we become romantic time travelers too. Although the script is by Bruce Joel Rubin who wrote Ghost the films mood doesnt change very much; its gentle wistful gauzy and placid. Bana so fantastic in Munich has always had to work overtime to prove that an actor who looks like the Aussie gym-rat version of Rodins The Thinker ?can play a gentle unassuming regular guy. But he does nicely here. He and McAdams are sweet together with matching dimples and starry eyes and we grow eager to see them remain in the same place. In the end thats all there is to the movie really. Its a time-travel fantasy in search of a cozy love seat. B?

"movie review the time travelers wife the time travelers wife movie review movie review the time travelers wife the time travelers wife movie review rachel mcadams eric bana - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review The Time Travelers Wife -- 4 out of 5 stars Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana Warner Bros. Warner Bros. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Clares jaw drops the moment she spies Henry and its not just love at first sight. Clare knows Henry even if he doesnt recognize her. Shes met him many times over the years. And his visits to the meadow on her familys estate turned him into her ideal man -- tall dark and handsome.It doesnt matter that she was 6 and he was 40ish. His nudity on their first meeting (she lends him a blanket) didnt scare her off nor did his presumptuous kiss when she was 18. She presses for a date and since shes played by the gorgeous misty-eyed Rachel McAdams thats not an issue. Hell meet her at the restaurant she assures him ( Eric Bana) is his ""favorite.""""Weve been planning this dinner a long time."" An elegy to love fate loss and free will The Time Travelers Wife is to science fiction what Twilight is to vampire tales -- a femme-centric exploration of relationships wrapped in genre fiction. We follow the decades of connection between this open-minded woman and a man who has had ""fits"" since childhood each one followed by his fading away only to reappear at some other place at some other point in time naked. He ""travels"" like The Terminator.Her ""ideal"" keeps showing up and courting her luring her into a relationship that to her seems pre-ordained. ""Ive been in love with you all my life"" she confesses. But who would want to be a time-travelers wife? His absences are long and unexpected the very definition of the guy ""afraid to commit."" He might wink out on her wedding day. Even if he takes great pains to show up as his older self and make good that big day theres all that explaining to do to the relatives.Robert Schwentke ( Jodie Fosters Flightplan) doesnt quite have what it takes to make this a first-class weeper. But if youre making a romance with a touch of the supernatural you cant do better than hiring the screenwriter for Ghost. Bruce Joel Rubin finds scenes of irony and pathos in Audrey Niffeneggers novel and makes them work even if his director isnt a romantic. Schwentke fixates on the logistics of time travel -- Henrys need to steal clothes with every fade out how a time traveler might get rich (think Back to the Future). Hes caught up in the sci-fi just like a guy.But the movie invites questions about entering into a love affair when you know the ending and accepting the consequences about how you treat the knowledge of someones impending death.McAdams is cast to great effect and shes nicely matched with Bana who finally plays a lead that feels conflicted earnest and romantic. Time traveling aside they make the relationship that is the heart of this work especially in those scenes where as in real life you realize that love may not as the cliche goes ""conquer all.""The Time Travelers Wife Four of five starsCast Rachel McAdams Eric BanaDirector Robert SchwentkeRunning time 1 hour 45 minutes.Industry rating PG-13 for thematic elements brief disturbing images nudity and sexuality Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel Movies Entertainment Transportation Industry Trips and Vacations Travel Fiction Rachel McAdams The Time Travelers Wife Movie Reviews Complete coverage of the Florida Film Festival Pulse ShootingAll SectionsNewsSportsBusinessClassifiedEntertainmentTravel92deg","http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/orl-movie-review-the-time-travelers-wife,0,1383626.story",200,thetimetraveler'swife30,thetimetraveler'swife,orlandosentinel

Theres no warning when this anomaly will strike but every time it does he just dissolves leaving behind a puddle of clothes as he melts like Margaret Hamilton in The Wizard of Oz and returns stark naked on busy streets or in crowded public rooms providing the audience with a number of unobstructed views of Australian actor Eric Banas rear end. Those who keep tabs on such things might consider that much skin adequate compensation for suffering through just under two hours of stultifying tedium. Unfortunately this movie needs a great deal more to keep more-demanding viewers from snoring. Henry the time traveler first became aware of his skills and their resulting predicaments when as a small boy he survived a automobile accident that killed his mother and left him traumatized for life. Through the years she keeps appearing not even knowing the man shes talking to is her son but there is nothing he can do to reverse fate warn her to stay off snowy highways or change the course of history. The time travelers wife played by scrumptious Canadian actress Rachel McAdams is a beautiful art student named Clare who has been in love with Henry since she met him at the age of 6 in a meadow behind her house. He was a 36-year-old naked man hiding in the bushes who asked her for her picnic blanket to cover up his private parts. (""Im a time traveler--I come from the future and when I do I dont get to bring my clothes."") In this preposterous fable instead of running screaming to the police she believes his story pledges undying love and waits decades for the day when they can finally meet in real time. When they do he doesnt recognize her from a different time zone but she weathers every challenge until he marries her. Sometimes shes 6 back in the meadow where she learns to keep extra trousers on hand just in case and sometimes shes a grown woman but one thing that never changes is her love. There are a few perks to time travel (you see the world and you never have to pack or wear a tie) but it doesnt take long for Clare to experience the downside. When he shows up on their wedding day hes got gray hair. When he vanishes on their wedding night hes got black hair. Young old or in Never Never Land one thing is constant--he never ever shaves. Lets face it Time travel is the pits. I mean you just cant depend on a mate who is never around when needed. Henry cant drive a car because he might disappear behind the wheel in the middle of traffic. He cant fly in a plane because if he vanishes on board it will never be in the same place in the sky when he returns. Hes never around for the big events like meeting Clares parents childbirth or holidays. ""Did I miss Christmas?"" ""And New Years."" But when he comes back from the future with a winning lottery ticket for five million dollars all is suddenly forgiven. Arriving at various destinations with no wallet and his Johnson hanging out its inevitable that he turns to thieves thugs and killers for travelerss aid. The movie grows longer and loopier by the minute until Henry comes home again one day with a bullet hole in his head. Thats when Clare sees her own future--as a single parent to daughter Alba. Eventually Henry travels beyond his own life span and meets Alba who may be seeing things herself and ... Oh forget it. The movie long ago stopped making a lick of sense. From here youre on your own. German director Robert Schwentke who guided Jodie Foster through Flightplan about the search for a child who disappears on a plane 30000 feet in the sky may have a feel for action in tight places but the claustrophobia in The Time Travelers Wife leads to a completely different kind of panic. I couldnt wait to escape and it wasnt for a breath of fresh air. Maybe the novel by Audrey Niffenegger which a number of people seem to have read and enjoyed was more convincing but the unsatisfactory yo-yo script by Bruce Joel Rubin who wrote Ghost makes no real effort to explore the inner emotions of the characters. Nobody loves loses and learns. Theyre just desperate and confused at all times. Among the supporters Arliss Howard is wasted as Mr. Banas drunken suicidal father and all-American Ron Livingston is miscast as his lifelong friend and best man an ethnic pal named Gomez. The film has none of the twists ironies and paradoxes (not to mention humor) that gave the Back to the Future time-travel trilogy such a wallop. Instead it concerns us more with trying to figure out exactly whats going on when and why. Half the time I didnt know whether the action was taking place in the future the past or outer space. Clearly Mr. Banas Henry is not the brightest bulb in the lamp. Consequently Ms. McAdams goes through so much unnecessary and ill-advised cardboard confusion that you begin to wonder if shes lost her marbles too. Bring back Michael J.

Eric Bana to his credit continues to wear the outfits picked out for him remarkably well. The hip-bougie upholstery even covers the band at the fairy-tale wedding playing ""Love Will Tear Us Apart."" Its not really love though that complicates things between Clare (Rachel McAdams) and Henry (Bana) but instead Henrys tendency to inconveniently melt in and out of the present finding himself unceremoniously stranded somewhere in time naked. The ""absentee time-traveling partner"" is an open invitation to apply your own metaphor--I favor a time-travel-equals-chronic-blackout-drinking reading but its elastic enough for whatever. Wife recalls a few other timeline-tangled romances not least the telescoped lifelong love of 1948s Portrait of Jennie--but where Jennie favored a ""poetic"" logic (and no-strings-attached romance) Wife forgoes any sense of mystery dealing in the daily difficulties of synchronizing schedules doctors appointments vasectomies pregnancies and meeting friends and parents (all crowding the movie and further diluting the already-limited rapport of the central lovers). This thoroughness may impress fans of the bestseller source novel but will disappoint anyone looking for transport from a movie--being a time travelers wife it turns out is mostly a drag.

""The Time Travelers Wife"" may not make a lick of sense but it does make for fairly irresistible nonsense. Auds who like their supernatural cinema rigorous and cerebral may have trouble warming to this beguilingly irrational tale of two soulmates finding and losing each other across time and space. But despite its breezily demented Mobius-strip construction the films unerring emotional logic anchored by a pair of actors (Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana) who give themselves over to the conceit completely should win over a solid femme-driven audience with even stronger returns from date-night ancillary. Adapted from Audrey Niffeneggers 2004 bestseller the picture falls in a tradition of endearingly ridiculous impossibly dreamy sci-fi romances from 1980s ""Somewhere in Time"" to 2006s ""The Lake House."" Like those films ""The Time Travelers Wife"" insists on a love that transcends both time and common sense; with the winsome pairing of Bana and McAdams its a fantasy that for the most part happily rings true. Things get off to a rough start as a fiery car crash claims the life of a woman but not that of her 6-year-old son Henry (Alex Ferris) who at the last minute unwittingly teleports himself into the recent past. Quickly returned to the accident scene Henry meets an older version of himself (Bana) who abruptly informs the traumatized tot that he has just traveled through time. ""He"" of course refers to older Henry and younger Henry both of whom have the ability -- or rather the uncontrollable compulsion -- to hopscotch between past present and future. Confused yet? As penned by Bruce Joel Rubin (Oscar-winning scribe of another paranormal love story ""Ghost"") the film plays out as a series of chronological seizures a la ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" leaping back and forth across the long arc of Henrys life -- the dazzling centerpiece of which is his relationship with earthy dark-haired beauty Clare (McAdams). Here they are meeting for the first time (or is it the 200th?) in the library where Henry works. But there he goes back to a lush green meadow where he tries to convince 6-year-old Clare (Brooklynn Proulx) hes her friend without giving away that hes also the love of her life. Stymied at first by exposition that complicates more than it clarifies (when Clare says ""I dont know what the hells going on"" you want to tell her to get in line) helmer Robert Schwentke (""Flightplan"") keeps the narrative threads moving so swiftly and with such hypnotic urgency even viewers who initially object to the films silliness may find themselves firmly in the grip of its romantic delirium. (For some it wont hurt that Henrys condition forces him to time-travel in the nude one of the few rules the pic sticks to with dogged consistency.) ""The Time Travelers Wife"" asks viewers to surrender their reason but not their wits; theres pleasure to be had in working out the storys puzzles (because there are multiple Henrys in play details of hair color become especially important) and poking holes in its paradoxes. Never so somber that they neglect the entertaining possibilities of their premise Schwentke and Rubin playfully invest their storytelling with a real sense of fun even mischief -- from the door-slamming farce of Henry and Clares wedding to the highly pragmatic solution Clare takes when she has trouble carrying a child to term. The governing principle here unusual for the time-travel subgenre is that even when Henry tampers with his past he is fundamentally unable to alter his future. For all its obvious forerunners the film emerges as a close cousin of ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" another bittersweet account of two lovers trying to live together as best they can in the face of inconvenient and unusual biological circumstances. McAdams draws on the romantic-tearjerker chops she displayed to captivating effect in ""The Notebook"" while Bana suffers endures and charms like a pro. While theyve had meatier roles the two actors keep this restless film firmly grounded; its focus on them is so consuming that even the fine supporting cast (including Ron Livingston and Arliss Howard as Henrys friend and father respectively) has little time to fully register. The pic is set in Chicago but was mainly shot in Toronto; the locations have an old-fashioned picturesque quality that along with capable visual effects and clever camera tricks heightens the films underlying sense of fantasy. The story may fall apart the minute the credits roll but any movie that can wring fresh emotion from the image of two lovers running toward each other across an open field is clearly doing something right.
