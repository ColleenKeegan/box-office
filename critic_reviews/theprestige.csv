Touchstone Pictures hide caption toggle caption Touchstone Pictures Scarlett Johansson shown here with Jackman is sent to discover what sort of tricks Bale has up his sleeve. Touchstone Pictures hide caption toggle caption Touchstone Pictures When the movie The Illusionist premiered this summer it took audiences by surprise with its early 20th-century magic act. Now comes The Prestige which deals with similar subject matter and has A-list stars a better-known director and a bigger budget. So with all those bells and whistles is it magical? Well first a digression. About a year ago I was invited up on stage to watch Ricky Jay the worlds most amazing card shark -- I think the actual word is prestidigitator -- spend a few minutes turning threes into queens and making aces rise up out of a deck and generally doing things way too cool to be possible. I sat at his elbow and never blinked and concentrated like crazy and decided after a while that the molecules in the card faces must be rearranging themselves. So it was fun to see him at the very beginning of The Prestige playing a bit part as a BAD magician. Hes got a manager (Michael Caine) who defends him and two assistants who dont think hes very good. As magician wanna-bes these assistants -- played by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman -- are naturally competitive. And when tragedy strikes the act theyre helping with they become enemies too. Soon theyre calling themselves The Professor and the Great Danton rival magicians on stages across the street from each other. They sneak in disguise to spy on what the other is doing; they sabotage tricks and steal them when they can. One trick that The Professor develops is called ""The Transported Man."" In it the magician travels from one side of the stage to the other in a split second. Its pretty fabulous and The Great Danton can only figure one way to do it and that pretty clearly isnt how The Professor is doing it so he sends his beautiful assistant played by Scarlett Johansson to see if she can squirrel it out of him. Thats all I can reasonably say about the plot this being what you might call a magical mystery tour of subterfuge. Suffice it to say that Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan who burst on the scene with Memento that murder mystery that moved backwards in time are up to some new tricks in The Prestige. These brothers arent interested solely in illusion. Theyre also playing games with science -- this being an age when electricity was considered mysterious -- and generally crossing up audience expectations and then double-crossing them. The film is never less than engaging though considering that the title The Prestige refers to the moment in a magic act that gives it its ""wow"" factor its kind of a shame that the ultimate ""reveal"" in the movie is a little too tricky for its own good. But then I say that as someone so clueless about magic that the only explanation I can come up with for a real-life card trick is that the card-face molecules must be rearranging themselves.

Selfhood emerges from these films as a rickety trick an illusion dependent on misdirection and oversight. Apt then that the directors latest is a story about magicians.Nolans first period picture The Prestige shares the fractured chronology common to his earlier work. Based in turn-of-the-last-century London the plot centres on two ambitious young illusionists flashy easygoing Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman abetted as in Batman Begins by Michael Caine) and the more original but less extrovert Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). Fellow apprentices turned bitter rivals after a grisly onstage accident their escalating feud is a game of cat and mouse played out in a hall of mirrors set in cramped prison cells and Colorado expanses as well as theatres as they compete to deliver the most spectacular version of a teleportation trick that calls for something like real magic. Jackman and Bale make impressive tango partners neither wholly sympathetic nor villainous each drawing out the synergy between his characters personality and his onstage style. Its a handsome film too beautifully photographed by Wally Pfister in a chocolate-and-cinnamon sepia palette flashed with electric blue. But The Prestige languishes in a structural Catch-22 of its own making. Explicitly modelled on the pattern of a magic trick its also bound to the rules of the mystery thriller genre; yet the one relies on lingering uncertainty the other on full disclosure. And in devoting so much room to hollow romantic subplots the film ends up breaking two of the magicians cardinal rules not only does it tell you how its all done it takes so long about it that youve got time to look up its sleeves and work it out for yourself.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 20 2006 556 PM Old Tricks The wizardry of The Prestige; plus Flags of Our Fathers and Running With Scissors. By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens Spoiler Special about The Prestige. Click here to play the audio or subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast in iTunes. Like Christopher Nolans first major film Memento The Prestige (Newmarket Films) has an intricate time-shifting story that never stops turning the tables on the viewer. Also like Memento it ends with a rapid mind-bending montage that wreaks havoc with our previous understanding of the films events. But unlike the previous film and to its great credit The Prestige is utterly without pretense. It doesnt want to explore epistemological questions about the nature of perception and memory; it just wants to mess with our heads. And as a wily slightly sadistic chess game of a movie it succeeds quite nicely. Without giving anything away I can say this much Robert Angier  (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are dueling magicians in Victorian London. The genesis of their quarrel Borden accidentally killed Angiers wife (Piper Perabo) onstage in an escape trick gone wrong. But as the years pass and their rivalry escalates her death becomes a mere pretext for the mens ever-more absurd feats of one-upmanship. Obsessed with Bordens signature trick the ""Transported Man"" Angier embarks on a quest to figure out how he does it--a quest that as every good quest should eventually leads him to David Bowie on a mountaintop.  Bowie plays Nikola Tesla the real-life inventor who was a contemporary and rival to Thomas Edison. Teslas technological contribution to the Angier/Borden matchup provides the plots fulcrum. It also shifts the movie from a Realist (if Gothic) thriller toward the realm of science fiction--a move that it might be argued cheats viewers at the game the movie itself has set for us. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Advertisement I know Im not the first to compare Jackman to Cary Grant but the analogy really is compelling. In addition to the physical resemblance they share a suave lightness that can easily shade over into menace. Bale is the perfect nemesis all brooding and cockney roughness. And Michael Caine whos cast as an ingeneur (a kind of magicians trainer) has enough sly wisdom not to take the whole thing too seriously. Clint Eastwoods last two movies have been overpraised genre pieces. Mystic River had a crude emotional power despite its rough spots but Million Dollar Baby came by its tears far too easily and some of its broad caricatures--the greedy redneck family the stoic black man--were downright disturbing. Disliking Flags of Our Fathers (DreamWorks) Eastwoods tribute to the Greatest Generation feels tantamount to spitting on the flag--or worse your father. But however deeply felt Eastwoods commitment to the project however laudable his struggle with the moral complexities of war he simply hasnt made a movie thats compelling to watch on its own terms. A potent one sure Its impossible to see young mens bodies blown up by grenades at point-blank range and not feel fear anger and nausea. But as graphic and frightening as parts of this film are--and some of the battle scenes can be watched only from between your fingers--Flags relies too often on the standard war-movie structure Develop the soldiers characters just long enough to be able to tell them apart then throw them on the battlefield to be picked off one by one in increasingly horrible ways. The long graphic battle scene of the landing on Iwo Jima filmed in desaturated colors recalls the opening of Saving Private Ryan and the final shot in which we revisit the same beachhead in the present is straight out of Schindlers List. In the movies best scenes Eastwood examines the way heroism is constructed retroactively by the PR machine of war. He follows the three surviving subjects of the famous Iwo Jima flag-raising photo (played by Ryan Phillippe Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach) as theyre sent on a U.S. tour to promote war bonds. The whole thing is folded into a present-day frame story in which one survivors son (Tom McCarthy) travels around interviewing the survivors who knew his father. The modern-day scenes are stiff enough to resemble an Army training film. It feels disrespectful to say it but this kind of war movie like war itself is starting to feel sickeningly familiar. Advertisement Augusten Burroughs the author of the best-selling coming-of-age memoir Running With Scissors (Sony) was sued by the Massachusetts family with whom he lived for several years in the late 1970s and whom he depicts as slovenly manipulative dog-food-munching child-abusing lunatics. But maybe the Turcottes (the real name of the family here called the Finches and played with gusto by the likes of Brian Cox Gwyneth Paltrow Jill Clayburgh and Evan Rachel Wood) neednt have worried so much. In the movie version written and directed by Ryan Murphy of TVs Nip/Tuck they actually come off as kind of loveable. Of course Murphy does change some of the books more jaw-dropping details for palatabilitys sake. For example when he was first molested by Neil Bookman (Joseph Fiennes) the gay schizophrenic who would become his sort-of boyfriend the real Burroughs was only 13 not 15. Joseph Cross a fresh-faced kid who also appears briefly as cannon fodder in Flags of Our Fathers hits just the right note as the exploited and vulnerable but ultimately resilient Augusten. Annette Bening who keeps getting better with every movie she makes plays the mother as a darker twist on the loveable narcissist she created for last years Being Julia. Her Deirdre Burroughs solemnly declaiming subpar feminist poetry from beneath a frosted shag haircut is a delicious monster. By turns cruel self-pitying and mordantly witty she makes living with a delusional psychotic seem like the adventure of a lifetime.

"Prestige The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; prestige-the ) Prestige The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Watching The Prestige is like observing a magic act where the magicians sleight-of-hand isnt deft enough. The trick almost works but not quitea| With its mechanical twists and turns and lack of heart the movie often resembles Sleuth in superficial ways except The Prestige resorts to cheating while Sleuth relied on cunning and guile. As is too often the case with narratives that try to be oblique to the end the films climax is strangely predictable. The Prestige goes to a great deal of trouble - including a triple time-line - to protect secrets that arent all that surprising or hard to guess. With a pedigree as splendid as the one behind The Prestige the movies inability to captivate consistently must be considered a disappointment. In the sweepstakes for best 2006 movie about conjurors performing circa 1900 The Illusionist is a few steps ahead of The Prestige. While one could argue that both films telegraph their third-act surprises The Illusionist is less ponderous and more enjoyable. There are times when The Prestige bogs down and the needlessly convoluted way in which director Christopher Nolan elects to present the story doesnt help. Maybe he was looking for inspiration from his brilliant non-linear Memento. The Prestige is too well made to be considered ""bad"" but it fails to deliver in ways that will earn it more shrugs than raves. Theres nothing wrong on the acting front headliners Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are at the tops of their games as rival magicians caught in the grip of an obsession to defeat one another. Michael Caine is delightful in a supporting role. Scarlett Johansson is wasted playing another love interest - a part with which she is gaining too much familiarity. Rebecca Hall plays a similar role but does it better. Theres also a bit of stunt casting with David Bowie playing real life scientist Nikola Tesla. The Prestige unfolds during three time periods. In the earliest we meet Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) who along with Ruperts wife Julia (Piper Perabo) are assistants to a magician. When a trick goes wrong because of something Alfred does and Julia dies Rupert blames his former friend. After that incident the two become bitter opponents not only attempting to out-do each other on stage but instigating acts of physical vengeance against one another. In the second time line Rupert is in Colorado Springs consulting with Nikola Tesla about a machine the scientist built that became an integral part of Alfreds show. Finally the film skips ahead to the fateful night when Alfred is seen to be involved in Ruperts death. He is tried convicted and sentenced to death. The Prestige is about obsession and the price paid to pursue it. Both Rupert and Alfred lose lovers because of it. Alfred pushes his wife (Rebecca Hall) away during a critical juncture in their marriage. Rupert falls in love with his assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) then uses her as a spy to uncover Alfreds greatest secret. She defects and tells Alfred the truth but retains a degree of loyalty to Rupert. Both men tease each other with messages in diaries and both are connected to one of the greatest trick designers of the era Cutter (Michael Caine). The narrative eventually missteps by taking a wrong turn down a road that leads into science fiction. For a period piece that is so meticulously detailed this is an odd way to go and in a way it seems to be a betrayal of all that has gone before. Its integration is awkward and it alters the suspension of disbelief curve (not for the better). Even buying this premise is not guaranteed to open the gates to unfettered enjoyment. As is often true of movies about revenge and obsession The Prestige is cold and Nolan crafts a storyline that is more complicated than necessary. If his goal is to make things seem more profound or to obscure whats around the next curve in the plot he is not entirely successful. As for the explanation at the enda|yes its one of those instances in which a guy holding a gun provides a blow-by-blow account more for the benefit of the audience than the other character. Those hoping to gain insight into how magicians work wont find a lot of help here. The details of a few tricks are revealed but theyre filled with cheats that can be found only in movies or literature. The title is explained as being one of three steps in a trick the pledge the turn and the prestige. Oddly its that third act the prestige where this film is found lacking. Theres plenty going on but never any real magic.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe That Old-Fashioned Magic on the Big Screen By RICHARD SCHICKEL Friday Oct. 20 2006 Share Tweet Read Later Send to Kindle Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME According to director Christopher Nolans new movie a great magic trick consists of three parts ""The Pledge"" in which the illusionist produces a common object (or ordinary person) and promises to do something wondrous with it; ""The Turn"" in which he subjects this object to an astounding transformation; and finally ""The Prestige"" in which perhaps a life but certainly the illusionists always tenuous hold on his audience is held in thrilling and suspenseful balance. This narrative structure analogizes rather neatly to the customary three-act movie plot and it is both clever and apt of Nolan (he of the backwardly told Memento) to underscore this point. The Prestige which he co-wrote with his brother Jonathan presents us with two magicians at first friends but soon enough deadly rivals Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) slick and romantically appealing is a master of on-stage presentation; Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is his technical superior but nowhere near so commanding a figure in the theater. One night something goes terribly wrong with their act (an assistant who happens also to be Angiers lover dies) and Borden is convicted of murder and languishes in jail waiting to be hanged. Meanwhile the radically deranged Angier seeks out a real historical figure Nicola Tesla (pioneer of alternating current among many other inventions) who is marvelously played by David Bowie. Angier wants the inventor whos into cloning to supply him with the ultimate trick. To be perfectly honest The Prestige is wildly overplotted and it contains a final gimmick that youre going to kick yourself for not recognizing sooner. In this context youre going to especially appreciate Michael Caines work as Cutter the man who engineers the lads best illusions and who is finally the most sensible and sympathetic figure present grounding the film in some sort of rationality. Yet for all the films murky misdirections it is very enjoyable. Thats because Nolans recreation of the illusionists backstage world is so marvelously detailed including as it does revelations of how some of their best tricks are accomplished. Its also because it conveys an excellent sense of the way these figures -- the rock stars of their era -- commanded their stages and the gaping attention of their public. In some measure it is because there are real romantic issues at stake in the film-emotional losses and betrayals (Scarlett Johanssons tricky sexually riven character). Persuasively acted this material is played with a simple often dark and passionate force that contrasts effectively with the spectacular chimeras over which Angier and Borden endlessly obsess.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Prestige"" with Hugh Jackman Christian Bale Michael Caine Scarlett Johansson Rebecca Hall Piper Perabo Andy Serkis David Bowie. Directed by Christopher Nolan from a screenplay by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan based on the novel by Christopher Priest. 135 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images. Several theaters. On a leaf-tossed hillside we see a strange crop a slew of top hats black and glossy strewn loosely on the ground as if growing like mushrooms. Its silent and we hear only the dry rustle of an autumn breeze stirring the leaves. Then a whisper male and knowing ""Are you watching closely?"" This is the alluring entry point of Christopher Nolans period drama ""The Prestige"" an assured bonbon of a film thats thoroughly and deliciously entertaining. Its about light and shadow; about time-bending and plot-twisting and sleight of hand; about the way a frock coat and a dusty spotlight transform a street kid into a gentleman before our eyes. Marred only by an awkward disappointing ending (you dont have to watch too closely to see it coming) ""The Prestige"" creates a magic of its own. Based on the sprawling novel by Christopher Priest the film is the tale of two competing magicians in turn-of-the-century London. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) were once friends and colleagues but after an illusion goes wrong with tragic results the men part bitterly. As their fame increases their rivalry builds -- Borden is the better magician Angier the superior showman -- leading to desperate measures ever-more-elaborate illusions and twisting side roads one involving the maverick scientist Nikola Tesla (played with great restraint by David Bowie). Better to know no more than that about the plot; its twists are best experienced fresh. But ""The Prestige"" is much more than its story. Nolan the skilled director of ""Memento"" ""Insomnia"" and ""Batman Begins"" knows more than most how to hold an audience in the palm of his hand; its almost a magic trick like those practiced by his characters. Jackman and Bale (both looking devilishly handsome as magicians should -- the better to distract the eye) stride confidently through the movie creating characters far from our world. Scarlett Johansson who seems born for Victorian frills breaths life into what could have been a candy-box figure. And Michael Caine playing an aging creator of stage illusion lends his soft-leather voice to the mix as he watches from the sidelines. ""Obsession"" he observes knowingly ""is a young mans game."" All this is captured in the flickering warm tones of cinematographer Wally Pfister a Nolan regular in burnished colors and come-hither darkness. Magic isnt always easy to come by on screen but ""The Prestige"" (like ""The Illusionist"" before it -- who knew this would be the year of turn-of-the-century magicians?) finds plenty in that mysterious art where in Teslas words ""people are happy to be mystified.""

Starring Hugh Jackman Christian Bale Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Christopher Nolan. (PG-13. 128 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Prestige"" the latest from Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") is a flat story about a rivalry between two magicians in turn-of-the-century London. Like ""The Illusionist"" also dealing with magic and set in the same era it presents a double cat-and-mouse game -- one between the main characters and the other between the filmmaker and his audience. Nolans fascination with magic and with tricks in general comes through without question but he approaches the subject with a seriousness that soon turns grim. Once the grimness descends it never lifts. It doesnt get a lift from its central characters who despite being played by charismatic leading men (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) remain neither appealing nor compelling. Neither does the story provide much interest. The film is devised as a kind of magic trick but here we see the trick coming from about an hour away. The obscure title derives from the name magicians give to a tricks third and final stage. (For example A man made to disappear is then made to reappear.) The ""prestige"" is where the shock surprise and magic happens and so the implicit promise is that the movie -- based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Priest -- will have the same effect. It doesnt. Jackman is Angier and Bale is Borden two aspiring magicians who begin their career as flunkies for a master magician (played by real-life master Ricky Jay). Angier cuts a good figure and has an engaging stage presence while Borden has no personal appeal at all. Hes a creep onstage and off. But he has a gift for creating magic tricks that far exceeds anything Angier can imagine. The two men start out as pals and then something happens -- something bad -- and they become enemies equally matched in that they each possess advantages that the other doesnt have. Their rivalry is not merely professional but also personal. Each without quite admitting it or perhaps even knowing it is intent on the others destruction. Such a setup should have been enough to fuel 100 minutes of drama (maybe even 130) but the film remains a cold exercise. Neither man relishes the idea of destroying the other -- at least not enough to be fun about it. Borden is a cold introvert whose emotions are hidden and so the movie follows Angier who is more recognizably human. But a peculiar situation develops. Though were focused on Angier and his earnest quest to find the greatest trick ever devised it begins to become ... not clear nothings clear ... but rather just possible that the cold obnoxious Borden may be ever so slightly more in the right than Angier. Thus we find ourselves watching an ice-cold movie about competition that contains not a shred of rooting interest. Theres not much in the way of romance either despite the presence of Scarlett Johansson as the lovely Olivia who is a kind of ""magician hag."" Olivia doesnt really care which magician shes in bed with. She likes anything in a top hat and if a guy has birds in his pockets all the better. Johansson is a good actress but anything before the 1920s seems too much of a stretch for her. Her consciousness at least for the time being registers as very post-World War I -- that is modern as in our era which began around 1920. David Bowie appears as the Serbian American scientist Nikola Tesla. But aside from the initial kick of ""Hey theres David Bowie"" he might be any actor stuck in a role that could have ended up on the cutting-room floor without anybody missing him. -- Advisory Sexual situations violence.

Plus Dirty Harrys anti-violence campaign. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis Illustration by Anooj Khan amp; Sons  (Photo Suzanne Tenner/Courtesy of TriStar Pictures Inc.) The bar is dauntingly high for blaming-mom memoirs but Augusten Burroughss Running With Scissors delivers its unkind cuts from a singular vantage. The narrator is an adoring gay boy who loses his Auntie Mameish (and bipolar) mother to the seventies an era in which loony-tunes therapists counseled patients to act out their anger instead of learning to manage it and to indulge their inner childrensometimes to the point of abandoning their families. A quarter-century on Burroughs has learned to manage his anger. He chronicles his surreal upbringing in a voice thats craftily deadpan so that each outlandish revelation makes you gasp with a mixture of horror and vindictive glee. You feel at once Omigod the poor helpless child and You are so burned you bad mom Ryan Murphys jaunty screen version of Running With Scissors proves that nothing consecrates ones depiction of a narcissistic mother like having her embodied by Annette Bening. Benings specialties are (a) insane people and (b) actresses. No the two arent synonymous but for Bening the two exist on a continuum. Her genius is for locating the actress withinthe person struggling to translate her inchoate feelings into performance. As Deirdre Burroughs she spreads the wings of her irradiated yellow caftan and declaims her latest unprintable confessional poem then turns to her son eyes shining and asks Was it powerful? Was it emotionally charged? Deirdre needs to dramatize her lifelong oppression by males among them Augustens alcoholic and emotionally unavailable dad (Alec Baldwin). Theres nothing unusual about the absent-dad-overbearing-mom household The shrinks once said it was the garden-variety gay-male-engendering environment. The source of Burroughss bitterness is that his mother didnt stick around. In the film its when Augustens bond with his fame-seeking mom is strongestwhen he fantasizes hes Deirdre giving poetry readings to packed auditoriumsthat she has a particularly ghastly breakdown (the music goes out of Benings voice) and her psychiatrist makes a house call. Murphy shoots the arrival of Dr. Finch (Brian Cox) as if hes Father Merrin come to exorcise Deirdres demons which is cute but upside-down Encouraging this sick woman to plumb her dark side is like making up a guest room for her demons to reside. The director does gravitate toward the cute but thats in keeping with the detachment of his source The feelings of loss and alienation are woven into the portrait of the timeinto the otherworldly fluorescent seventies fashions and sitcoms in which its hero seeks escape. A director doesnt have to melodramatize a moment like Deirdres parting from Augusten after depositing him in the squalid chaotic Finch manse with leaning towers of filthy dishes and teenagers toying with electroshock machinesa household that Gomez Addams would find unhealthily permissive. (Deirdres smug feminist mantras are about as apt as mad Alexs in Fatal Attraction Had Augusten renounced his homosexuality Running With Scissors would make a textbook neoconservative attack on the counterculture.) Running With Scissors would be more involving with a less distanced Finch the therapist whose external world (mousy hunchback wife slavish and semi-delusional older daughter patients adopted like stray cats) expresses the disorder within. Burroughs describes a man with a reassuring Santa Claus warmth but Cox is a frosty actor with a gift for making you laugh at his creepy unknowability and he inhabits a different plane altogether from Joseph Crosss Augusten. Augusten is a passive role but Cross gets a lot of dramatic mileage out of his hurting blue eyes and throbbing Adams apple. Running With Scissors ends with its hero growing up and moving on but it doesnt seem finished until Murphy shows you the real Burroughs sitting side-by-side with his fictional counterpart. This coming-of-age story is cathartic only when it spells out the idea that writing a best-selling memoir is the best revenge. 1 2 3 Next Share this story...

A master magician (Christian Bale) pulls off an amazing trick and his rival tries to learn the secret in The Prestige. Photo Touchstone Pictures The Prestige 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Rival magicians Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale strive to be the hardest act to follow in The Prestige. Too late. Theyve both been trumped by The Illusionist a more satisfying entertainment that explores the same esoteric territory magicians as superstars in late-19th-century Europe. Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale) are London magicians who become bitter foes after a stunt goes horribly wrong. While The Prestige masquerades as a romance the film chiefly concerns the mens insufferable competitiveness. They act like extreme-sports junkies with adrenaline to burn -- and not much sense. Nor does the film involve much wonder for magic itself. Rather than tantalizing illusions it offers magic thats revealed as not-so-cheap tricks. We see the guts of the gizmos and the sneakiness of the stunts while each man tries to one-up the other -- at any cost. The film also applies misdirection which is what magic is all about. Not everything is as it seems not when theres money to be made reputations to be carved body-doubles to be used and surprise endings to be sprung. With Christopher Nolan (Memento) directing its time-jumbled narrative also never really clicks. Its more confusing than absorbing. The film has fine period details and a strong supporting cast which includes Michael Caine and David Bowie as magic-driven men. Oh yes -- Scarlett Johansson plays a showy stage assistant who bounces between the rivals. But its a bland thankless role so dont expect much. The real magic would be for Hollywood to start giving women as many meaty roles as it lavishes on men. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Dicks Sporting Goods Clearance Sale Extra 40% off + free...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Critics have been warned not to reveal the plot secrets of the exhilarating dueling-magicians movie ""The Prestige."" Which of course gets my back up and inclines me toward giving something away out of spite - except I havent yet figured out the movie myself. This picture about the soul of a trick has a tricky soul. So the hard- earned wonders of ""The Prestige"" are hereby preserved through a combination of the directors skill and my own blissful ignorance. Director Christopher Nolan who adapted ""The Prestige"" from a book with his brother Jonathan never met a rabbit he couldnt move to the least-suspected hat. He first twisted ""Memento"" into a feverish nightmare of audience surprise then went on to the dark puzzle of ""Insomnia."" His most commercial success ""Batman Begins"" was disarmingly smart and Nolan let good casting do much of Batmans work. All those directing skills are in evidence with ""The Prestige"" which follows the long feud of Victorian-era illusionists Borden (Christian Bale) and Angier (Hugh Jackman). Nolan takes us inside the gritty world of competing showmen and explores their lives seriously only to reveal that much of what weve just seen may itself have been an illusion. ""The Prestige"" begins in the middle folds back to the beginning lurches forward toward the end and doubles back again. Borden and Angier start as lowly helpers to a mediocre magician. Angiers wife is the pretty assistant and Borden is the audience plant who must tie her up in a way that allows her to escape a dunk tank. She drowns and Angier vows a lifetime of revenge on Borden. We also know that later in chronological time Borden is on trial for drowning Angier. He allegedly sneaked backstage during Angiers dunk-tank trick and jammed the secret escape door. In between Borden and Angier battle across London and America alternately stealing tricks or sabotaging each others acts. Bale is his usual intense self to good end here as a magician more condescending than entertaining. Jackmans Angier meanwhile has the stage presence to make himself rich but perhaps not the psychological depth to stay ahead in the feud he started. The fact we dont much like either one of these wayward wizards is the only real problem with ""The Prestige."" The story intentionally keeps us from identifying a winner but letting us root for one would help. Before the Nolans are done toying with us weve even visited physicist Nikola Tesla in his Colorado Springs electricity lab - another trick in a way as Tesla is David Bowie disguising himself as a good actor. The climax of ""The Prestige"" is a long argument over how both magicians carry out their versions of ""The Transported Man"" a trick that requires the illusionist to be in two places at once. What can a critic say that will help you enjoy the movie without giving away any secrets? The same youd tell yourself before a spine-tingling magic show Believe nothing the showmen say about themselves or their associates. Remember theres a reason some refer to magic as the dark arts. And the best explanation for a trick might be the simplest. Unless theres real magic involved in which case youre on your own. Call when youve figured it out. |""The Prestige"" PG-13 for mild language violence and adult subject matter|2 hours|PERIOD THRILLER|Directed by Christopher Nolan written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan based on the book by Christopher Priest; starring Christian Bale Hugh Jackman Scarlett Johansson David Bowie and Michael Caine|Opens today at area theaters.

Comments The Prestige The premise of this Victorian drama--a London theatrical magician (Hugh Jackman) tries to fend off a more cunning rival (Christian Bale)--weirdly parallels the predicament of director Christopher Nolan whose movie opened in the long shadow of Neil Burgers The Illusionist. That movie also centers on a 19th-century magician and the elegant contours of its story are even more impressive compared with Nolans clutter of double and triple crosses. A substantial subplot here involves Jackman developing a secret project with pioneering electrical engineer Nikola Tesla (a delectably arch David Bowie); it doesnt really add anything but Teslas high-voltage coils throw off a lot more lightning than Scarlett Johansson as Jackmans sultry stage assistant.

"Its magician vs. magician in Prestige - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Its magician vs. magician in Prestige By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  October 20 2006 Now you dont see them now you do. On the heels of ``The Illusionist"" the seasons surprise hit comes a second tale of period legerdemain. Ironically doubles are at the heart of ``The Prestige"" which sets two magicians at each other  s throats in a decade-long battle for supremacy. Its like ``The Illusionist"" crossed with a really hard Sudoku.Fun? Yes even when the machinery of betrayal and counter-betrayal gets overly busy. Based on the 1995 novel by Christopher Priest ``The Prestige"" has been directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan and its very much the work of the man who gave us 2000s ``Memento."" There are flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks here and not all of them tell the truth.The setting is Victorian London and the first thing we see is well-known magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) slip backstage and queer the act of his rival Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) . Angier drowns Borden is tried and in prison he is given the dead mans diary which unleashes the films back-story.The mutual vendetta began we learn following an onstage tragedy in the two mens youth. Each subsequently vows to best the other in magic and in life Borden has the skill Angier has the showmanship and their loved ones can only look on aghast. These include Rebecca Hall as Bordens increasingly confused wife Scarlett Johansson as a stage assistant whose heart may or may not belong to both men and Michael Caine cackling from the sidelines as the creator of the stage tricks that dazzle the multitudes.Eventually Borden debuts a number called ``The Transported Man"" which drives Angier into a fit of jealousy. His obsession leads him -- why not? -- to the Colorado Springs laboratory of Nikola Tesla inventor of AC current and himself a rival of Thomas A. Edison. In one of the movies most felicitous appearing acts Tesla is played by David Bowie who acts as if its perfectly normal for him to be here. Even better his assistant is played by Andy Serkis -- Gollum of ``The Lord of the Rings  "" finally allowed to take human shape.This is grand half-crazy fun and Jackman and Bale are committed to their parts Genuine madness glints in their eyes. (Johansson by contrast appears to have been cast to fill out that eensy-weensy assistants costume; this is not criticism.) ``The Prestige"" begins to spin out of the directors control around this time though. One shadowy character in particular is easy to identify; once you tumble to that the games up.Worse ``The Prestige"" doesnt play fair to a fundamental rule of the magician-movie genre That everything that occurs must be physically possible. An element of sci-fi is introduced at a crucial juncture and while it takes the movie to an interesting (if weird) level its hard to shake the sense that someone is cheating.The title is theater slang referring to the third part of a magic trick. The set-up is called The Pledge the initial ruse The Turn. The Prestige is the twist that sends you home gobsmacked . Nolan has the first two down perfectly  but the finale requires more sleight of hand than even this skilled prestidigitator can manage.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Hugh Jackmans upper-class Angier and Christian Bales working-class Borden are obsessives who will go to any length to outshine the other. Part of the fun is learning the tricks of the illusionists trade. The ubiquitous Scarlett Johansson plays Jackmans assistant spy and lover Michael Caine his designer of illusions. The beguiling Rebecca Hall is Bales wife and a sly David Bowie plays the inventor Nikola Tesla. This cerebral thriller is a sleight-of-hand act itself it proceeds by misdirection and culminates in triple-whammy twists.

He finds summer work as factotum to an eccentric former actress (Julie Walters). Besides helping Ben cut the apron strings it gives him confidence behind the wheel of a car - and in life - as well as a better appreciation of his father. This understated comedy-drama allows Walters and Grint a great opportunity to step out of their familiar roles as mother and son Molly and Ron Weasley in the ""Harry Potter"" films. Grade B- M.K.

I wasnt nuts about ""The Illusionist"" but because I love magic on film I was reasonably entertained. Im also not crazy about plot-heavy ""Prestige"" but it has its moments too.

It presents no grand conspiracy theory to explain why Kerry failed to carry the state. Instead supported by commentary from both Republican and Democratic operatives the movie confirms what most of us have known all along Electability is all about staying on message.

In the Victorian age of high magic showmanship a woman gets dunked with a violent splash into a glass tank and its far from preordained that shell ever get out. A man makes a bird vanish by smashing its cage; a bullet catcher asks a ruffian in the crowd to fire a gun at him and the trick turns out to be as hazardous as it sounds. Then theres the enigmatic silver sphere invented by Thomas Edisons rival Nikola Tesla that shoots off white bolts of Frankensteinian voltage teleporting a top hat (or a person) from one place to the next. Magic or technology? Either way The Prestige wants to fool your senses by ripping a hole in reality. It does so with a busy at times brutal singlemindedness. Nolan unfurls the parallel stories of two magicians the sleek showman Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and the brooding virtuoso of illusion Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) the two of whom start as young partners but end up as fierce competitors trying to top each others secrets in a fake-out to the death. The Prestige leaps around in time with dizzy abandon a deliberate strategy to make magic seem like the most concrete grounded thing in the movie. It works though at the expense of giving the audience much room to breathe. Kicking off with an apparent murder the movie flashes back to Angier and Borden as they learn the tricks of their trade abetted by Cutter (Michael Caine) a builder of illusionary hardware who explains the three parts of every great feat of magic the Pledge (mundane setup) the Turn (which fashions it into something extraordinary) and the Prestige (in which the ordinary is restored with a miraculous twist). This formula of wonder comes alive as each magician lures audiences with his version of the Transported Man in which the performer enters a door on one side of the stage only to emerge moments later from a door on the other side. How Borden achieves his far more amazing version is the movies pivotal mystery. Watching The Prestige you may find yourself longing for a bit of the old-fashioned streamlined trickery of The Illusionist. Nolan gives his heroes wives plus an assistant (played by Scarlett Johansson) who becomes the spy/mistress for each man in turn but the relationships arent convincing; theyre more like setups for illusions -- flesh-and-blood versions of the Pledge. The film works best on stage where Nolan keeps your eyes popped wide in curiosity. His canniest move is to reveal the key to certain tricks thus upping the ante on the tricks we arent in on. Jackman all keen intensity and Bale who knows how to push passion to the brink of pathology are magnetic foils and David Bowie makes Tesla a turn-of-the-century gentleman freak genius. The Prestige isnt art but it reaps a lot of fun out of the question How did they do that?

Yet thats precisely where Christopher Nolans plush period mystery goes from middling to messy. Combined high polish so-so character involvement and a confusing denouement wont help this handsome production once word-of-mouth trumps alluring advance come-ons. ""Every great magic trick has three acts"" were told early on in ""The Prestige."" Title is lingo for a stage stunts capper moment. Yet thats precisely where Christopher Nolans plush period mystery goes from middling to messy. Tale of dueling magicians played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale takes itself awfully seriously yet might have ideally suited a 1938 programmer pitting Karloff against Lugosi. Combined high polish so-so character involvement and a confusing denouement wont help this handsome production once word-of-mouth trumps alluring advance come-ons. Pic will also suffer from being ""the other"" movie about 19th-century professional conjurers though its very different from current ""The Illusionist."" While that pic is essentially a romance ""The Prestige"" focuses on the blood feud between American abroad Robert Angier (Jackman) and Cockney Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). Theyre introduced as ""volunteers"" picked from an English music hall audience to bind magicians assistant Julia (Piper Perabo). Plunged into a water tank she miraculously escapes. In fact the two young men are apprentice magicians secretly a part of the act. Further Julia is wife to personable Robert. Hes a natural showman while taciturn Alfred is a more gifted illusionist. But in the name of slick presentation Alfred takes risks that dont pass muster with safety-minded mentor Cutter (Michael Caine). One day Alfred ties a more-difficult yoke -- with Julias permission -- that results in her being unable to free herself; she drowns before an ax can break the glass tank. Robert is enraged and inconsolable particularly when he spies Alfred with new wife Sarah (Rebecca Hall) and baby -- the happy family he feels robbed of. The men develop separate acts with Roberts successful while Alfred toils in dives. Nonetheless Robert remains consumed by thoughts of vengeance. What starts out an exchange of petty humiliations turns into vicious increasingly violent one-upmanship. Seeing Alfred perform a stupendous act called ""The Transported Man"" Robert vows to steal it. When hes unable to figure it out himself he dispatches onstage assistant and offstage lover Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) to seduce the secret from his rival. This central chronology is interspersed throughout with dual flash-forward threads. In one Robert travels to Colorado Springs to petition reclusive inventor Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) to build a machine like the transport he supposedly built for Alfred. In the other thread Alfred stands trial for the death of Robert whom weve seen drown just like his late wife. While complicated intrigue might have fascinated in Christopher Priests novel it tends to overwhelm Jonathan and Christopher Nolans adaptation. Pic insists on a depth of human emotion that isnt developed -- protags emerge as one-dimensional despite the efforts of two of our best leading actors -- amid increasingly elaborate uninvolving plot mechanizations. Pics resolution suddenly admits to fantastical and hitherto-unsuspected elements. Its a flame-out likely to send most viewers home perplexed. Clearly director Nolan is aiming for something else. But the delight in sheer gamesmanship that marked his breakout ""Memento"" doesnt survive this projects gimmickry and aspirations toward ""Les Miserables""-style epic passion. Jackman a familiarly intense Bale Caine Johansson (good if risking overexposure these days) and others all hit notes previously played in better roles. On the other hand perpetually undervalued as an actor Bowie brings an elegant enlivening edge to Tesla though that figures resonance as a real-life enigma will be lost on many.
