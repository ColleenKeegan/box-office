Comments The Unborn This exuberantly creepy mash-up of Jewish folklore J-horror atmospherics and demonic possession boilerplate might have fared better with critics had writer-director David S. Goyer not gone overboard with references to Dr. Josef Mengele and his sadistic Auschwitz experiments on identical twins. Issues of Holocaust exploitation aside the movie is a proficient creepshow spiked with sly quotes from past schlock classics and dry humor related to its substitution of a mild-mannered reform rabbi (Gary Oldman) for the usual grizzled Jesuit. Willowy Odette Yustman looks great in her underwear and otherwise gets by just fine as a Chicago teen whose nightmares and hallucinations bespeak dark family secrets. PG-13 87 min.

But now the latest in an infected bloodline to be possessed by a dybbuk (a spirit) wants to be born. It all began with her grandmas experience at the hands of  Nazi eugenicists and now college girl Casey (Odette Yustman) must finish what began in Auschwitz. One of her brown eyes turns Aryan blue and she is compelled to pad around in her underwear. Her sensitive boyfriend (Cam Gigandet) and sassy girlfriend (Meagan Good) cant help so Casey asks a rabbi (an embarrassed Gary Oldman) to rid her of this evil spirit. Goyer throws everything at this preposterous plot - a demonic child spooky mirrors a rabid dog with an upside-down head and an exorcism conducted in Hebrew. Its almost too silly to be offensive. Almost but not quite.

ABOUT THE MOVIEUnborn 1/2 (out of four) Stars Odette Yustman Gary Oldman Meagan Good Jane AlexanderDirector David S. GoyerDistributor Rogue PicturesRating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and terror disturbing images thematic material and language including some sexual referencesRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Theres no escaping the Holocaust at the movies. Just when it seemed we reached a tipping point of dramas chronicling Nazi atrocities along comes The Unborn a laughably bad horror flick involving demonic possession concentration camps and torturous genetic experiments. The Unborn cribs from so many movies its enough to make your head spin. Perhaps thats why so many craniums go rotating during this cheesy thriller. Casey (Odette Yustman) spends most of the movie fighting off an evil spirit. The malevolent force has taken up lodging primarily inside a creepy ashen-faced boy for whom Casey baby-sits. He turns up at inopportune -- though not exactly unexpected --times and appears to be in cahoots with her medicine cabinet which is haunted. He makes cryptic usually nonsensical but always sinister pronouncements. Then theres a dog-like creature whose head spins in disconcerting ways. And if those standard instruments of fear and loathing arent sufficiently terrifying beware the swarms of giant scuttling bugs. The malicious spirit or dybbuk is somehow connected with Caseys twin brother who died in utero. Why this wicked creature waited until she was in college to begin tormenting her is anybodys guess. The dybbuk travels from the bug-eyed neighbor kid to infiltrate other innocent victims flitting from person to person like a diabolical game of tag. Caseys grandmother (Jane Alexander) is a Holocaust survivor who tries to explain the demonic presence spinning a convoluted tale involving Nazi genetic experimentation. She first encountered the satanic spirit when she and her twin bother were children in Auschwitz. She claims to have slain the devil that inhabited her brothers body. But for some reason it has returned. Apparently they just do that. The elderly Jewish woman urges her granddaughter to slay the demon thusly ""It has fallen on you to finish what began in Auschwitz."" Did writer/director David Goyer actually write that sentence and not hear its implications? Or maybe an errant line from Valkyrie made its way onto a page of The Unborn script. Gary Oldman plays a rabbi to whom Casey goes for an exorcism. She begs him to translate a massive Hebrew tome. He doesnt actually believe in dybbuks and has never performed an exorcism but within days hes translated the voluminous book and assembled a slew of assistant demon-slayers from several religious faiths. What a wonderful night for an ecumenical exorcism. Bodies flail glassy eyes flash and the demon hops from person to person till almost no one remains standing.

"Unborn The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; unborn-the ) Unborn The (United States 2009) A movie review by James Berardinelli For a while The Unborn unfolds like a nice little PG-13 horror film should a dash of atmosphere a heroine who spends lots of time in her underwear a general sense of enhanced creepiness and an effective ""boo"" moment or two. Then it commits a cardinal sin and tries to explain whats going on. This is where many a horror movie falls and never again rises too much exposition. Not only does it defuse the mystery but it often makes it impossible to continue suspending disbelief. The more the characters babble about twins demons the door being open and other such nonsense the more preposterous The Unborn seems. It then crosses the threshold from ludicrous to idiotic during its final third when the blood starts flowing the body count mounts and the evil spirit moves freely from body to body. The climax is presented in such an operatic over-the-top style complete with a bombastic score that its nearly impossible to stifle a guffaw. Maybe approaching The Unborn as horror is the wrong approach. Perhaps this should be seen as a comedy. It is quite possibly the most egregiously laughable high-profile supernatural tale since Roman Polanski and Johnny Depp impaled themselves on The Ninth Gate. Casey Beldon (Odette Yustman) is an average well-adjusted teenager (her mother committed suicide and her father is almost never around) until the day when a creepy little boy who looks like he just stepped out of a grave invades her dreams and dogs her waking footsteps. She is understandably freaked out by this especially when she has a vision of the kid curled up in her medicine cabinet. But never fear theres always the Wise Old Woman Whose Sole Purpose Is To Provide Plot Exposition. In this case shes Auschwitz survivor Sofi Kozma (Jane Alexander) the Grandmother Casey never knew she had. So instead of doing what any vaguely rational teenager would do and paying a visit to a psychiatrist Casey elects to spend time with Grandma. Its around this time that she also discovers she had a twin brother who died in utero when her umbilical cord wrapped around his neck and apparently thats whos haunting her. Or something like that. Thankfully Sofi makes everything clear - at least to Casey if not to us. After having her conversation with the elderly lady Casey goes home and breaks all her mirrors steals a really old book from a library and finds a Rabbi (Gary Oldman) and asks him to perform an exorcism on her. Oldmans appearance in The Unborn comes as a bit of a surprise. My guess is that he was between appearances in Harry Potter and Batman movies and needed a little spare cash. Either that or Max von Sydow wasnt available. The movie steals so much from The Exorcist (including a man doing a ""spider walk"") that an appearance by von Sydow woudnt have been unexpected. But its just Oldman. As a performer he acts circles around his young vivacious co-star Odette Yustman whose ""big break"" was in last years Cloverfield. Thespian talent aside she trumps him in certain areas like looking better in her skivvies. Not that we see him strip down for comparison. He is playing a rabbi and theres not much call for men of the cloth to wander around half-naked in movies like this. In their desperation to market The Unborn as something more substantive than it is Rogue Pictures has latched onto the hook that writer/director David S. Goyer was also involved in last years biggest movie The Dark Knight. Goyer was co-credited with Christopher Nolan for the story upon which Nolan and his brother Jonathan based the screenplay. For a better representation of Goyers cinematic legacy one needs look no further than the Blade series. He wrote all three of those movies and directed the third. Sad to say as bad as Blade Trinity was it was better than this. There is one thing of interest about The Unborn. Its not a remake of an Asian horror film but it feels like one. Thats not just because its incoherent and borderline-unwatchable - characteristics common with those remakes - but it has the same gothic style-over-substance approach favored by them. And the plot distills to the same basic ingredients a nasty ghost or demon is messing with our poor heroine in sinister but PG-13 ways. Perhaps thats how Goyer got a greenlight on The Unborn - by fooling the producers into thinking this is actually an Asian horror remake. Those things get funded no matter how bad they are and some of them are very bad - even worse than The Unborn. Hey but at least the girl looks good in her underwear. And if you dont think thats a big selling point take a look at the poster. Unborn The (United States 2009) Director David S.

"Movie review The Unborn -- 1 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review The Unborn -- 1 out of 5 stars A scene from The Unborn Universal A scene from The Unborn A scene from The Unborn (Universal) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Lets treat the horror film The Unborn as a teachable moment. The movies not very good but there are ideas good and bad in its execution that are worth mulling over.Cast the best actors you can afford. If you can get Jane Alexander to play a Holocaust survivor James Remar as a two-scenes dad Carla Gugino as a ghost-mom with no lines in her flashback scenes and Gary Oldman and Idris Elba as a rabbi and a priest who moonlight as exorcists (hey we all have to take on second jobs in this economy) you do it. Putting your skinny young leading lady (Odette Yustman of Cloverfield) in panties in several scenes and on the poster? Again smart move. Know your audience for PG-13 horror. Yustman an indifferent Jennifer Connelly clone is so thin you could roll a bagel with lox between those thighs. Not that youd want to do that sort of thing.But this fright show from writer-director David S. Goyer (The Invisible and he wrote the awful Jumper) is a maddening hodgepodge of plot distractions gimmick fights and too many characters. Its a pretty but pretty cluttered un-frightening mess that brings in the Holocaust Jewish myth and mysticism mental illness unsafe sex and a very strange-looking little boy (Atticus Shafer) who seems willing to hurt people to get a message to his baby-sitter Casey (Yustman). ""Jumby wants to be born now.""This freaks out Casey and sends her running to her boyfriends arms (Cam Gigandet) and off to seek help from her superstitious friend (Meagan Good another plum in the cast). As Casey hallucinates more visions of dogs with their heads upside down and demons in her medicine cabinet she recalls her dead mom (Gugino) and begins to decipher this mystery which is why she goes to the rabbi (Oldman professional as always).There are hair-raising moments here though theyre not the shock-edits (complete with loud musical effect) that Goyer hurls at us the bugs or even the creepy dogs and people whose heads spin around upside to mimic the Dybbuk an evil spirit described in Jewish folklore. A scratchy old home movie is the most chilling bit. But who takes home movies of the place where Mom was institutionalized and hung herself? And black-and-white home movies from ""six years ago?""Finally a word of caution to parents wanting to turn their little darlings into child stars. Its bad enough naming your lad Atticus. Hes going to get teased until his classmates see or read To Kill a Mockingbird. Cashing in on your childs odd appearance (its not makeup) is kind of creepy no? He was a punch-line in American Carol too. Let him age out of his Eddie Munster years in peace.

And then theres ""The Unborn."" The most effective horror movies prey on fears percolating just beneath societys surface. And then theres writer-director David S. Goyers ""The Unborn"" which conceives a demon unleashed by Nazi experiments in Auschwitz to justify its derivative Japanese-horror-style scares rather than tapping into the anxiety of a pregnancy suggested by its title. Rogue Pictures just sold to Relativity Media should deliver healthy opening-weekend crowds for the PG-13 thriller by stressing Goyers ""The Dark Knight"" connection as well as the genetic advantages of young leads Odette Yustman scene-stealing Meagan Good and ""Twilights"" Cam Gigandet. Pic marks a departure for Michael Bays Platinum Dunes shingle representing the first original scarefest from an outfit best known for remaking such horror classics as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Amityville Horror."" And yet so familiar are the recycled bits that make up this ""The Exorcist""-meets-""The Grudge"" combo that Goyer isnt likely to get much credit for all the background research he did trying to flesh out a fresh backstory for such supernatural shenanigans. In this case he combines Jewish mysticism -- technically thats a dybbuk possessing the people in scandalously sexy coed Casey Beldons life -- with the perverse pseudoscientific experimentation practiced on twins by German doctors during World War II. Early in the film Casey (""Cloverfield"" vet Yustman) learns she is a twin though her brother died in the womb. Casey is still haunted by visions of her mother (Carla Gugino) who went crazy and hanged herself years earlier and now she fears the same thing may be happening to her. How else to explain the fact that Jumby (the dead boys nickname) ""wants to be born now""? Casey has creepy dreams about demon fetuses and hears an ominous knocking behind her bathroom mirror; breaking eggs one morning shes startled to find giant potato bugs in her skillet. Each of these visuals is accompanied by all the usual racket that can be expected to make teens jump that much higher in their seats -- though widespread giggling seemed to be the more pervasive response at a preview screening. It doesnt help the directors credibility that Casey spends much of her time taking showers and running around in her underthings (carefully balanced by footage of her beefcake boyfriend played by Gigandet). Eventually the sheer number of disturbances compel Casey to do some amateur sleuthing which leads her to a Holocaust survivor (Jane Alexander) with clues about her family history. Goyer presents these revelations in all seriousness but betrays his comicbook background in the process. Whereas ""The Dark Knight"" (for which Goyer received a story credit) surprisingly allowed the Jokers origins to remain a mystery the medium typically goes to great lengths to explain villainy through a single iconic creation myth. Here we get a fetishistic Nazi montage caught somewhere between camp and outright offensive meant to explain the most original of ""The Unborns"" supernatural details Caseys eyes which have been brown her entire life are slowly turning blue. An exorcism is Caseys only hope and for this task Goyer enlists ""The Dark Knights"" Gary Oldman to play the rabbi charged with casting the demon out. But pic doesnt imbue Rabbi Sendak with any of the self-doubt that afflicted ""The Exorcists"" Father Merrin and the actor seems content to phone in his performance. To Goyers credit he never shies away from showing the things that terrorize Casey and her circle which range from a snarling dog with its head upside-down to a multi-tentacled Lovecraftian presence lurking in the walls of a public restroom. But before long the connective tissue between scares starts to call attention to its own preposterousness. Whereas Japanese horror movies have been criticized for not making sense ""The Unborn"" errs on the opposite extreme coming off all the more ridiculous for over-explaining itself.

The Unborn. (PG-13) Rogue (96 min.) Directed by David S. Goyer. Stars Odette Yustman Cam Gigandet Gary Oldman Jane Alexander. Now playing in New Jersey. ONE STAR. What do you get when you combine mysterious old women small saucer-eyed children hunky young athletes mystical Jewish teachings and ferociously toned bodies in skimpy lingerie? Outside of a weekend at Madonnas I mean? Well if you add some cheap scares a few slumming actors and some PG-13 gore you get ""The Unborn"" a new horror movie. And if you go see it you lose about 90 minutes of your life. Its more than a bit disappointing because there are a couple of respectable names in the cast including the lovely Jane Alexander and the entertainingly eccentric Gary Oldman. The pleasant Carla Gugino shows up too albeit in wordless flashbacks. At least director/writer David S. Goyer while erratic -- last year he was responsible for the story to one of the best films ""The Dark Knight"" and the screenplay to ""Jumper"" one of the worst -- has been writing genre movies for more than 15 years. He should know the ropes. Unfortunately he knows them a little too well. That dog with the human face? A nod to the second remake of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (or if youre even a little older ""The Mephisto Waltz""). The backward ""spider-walk"" up the stairs? A steal from the restored re-release of ""The Exorcist."" Actually the whole movie is a bit of an ""Exorcist"" re-possession with Odette Yustman -- and if its not an alias she should get one -- as the girl with a spirit out to get her. Cam Gigandet recently of ""Twilight"" (cue tween sighs here) is her boyfriend; Oldman is her rabbi. Which should worry her right there. I mean you go into temple and Gary Oldmans there on the bema? Thats kind of like going into the confessional and seeing Father Christopher Walken on the other side. Time to seriously check out another congregation. Actually the religious angle is this movies sole bit of creativity. Instead of having the Catholic Church do the heavy metaphysical lifting this time its Judaism. Which after a long -- and insultingly exploitative -- detour to Auschwitz enables the filmmaker to bring on a shofar and plenty of Hebrew prayers. After half an hour or so however you may be making some desperate pleas yourself. Characters appear and disappear and theres no logic to the horror. Im willing to believe mirrors are a gateway to another world (hey I saw ""Candyman"" too) but why are there giant bugs everywhere and whats with the creepy neighbor kid? The script also takes the easy horror-movie way out of giving the heroine bad dreams. This is a screenwriters cheapest cop-out -- dont integrate the scares into the plot just turn them into nightmares. And when youve written yourself into a corner have the young woman wake up Our escape isnt so easy. Unless we trudge up the aisle prematurely were stuck there with nothing to do but count Oldmans changing accents or mourn that this is the best gig actresses like Alexander or Gugino can get. Thats assuming of course that you can watch this without dwelling endlessly on the gore. Or the wan charms of Gigandot playing a boyfriend so annoying you start hoping for a death scene. Or Yustmans own painful nothingness. ""I just want this to be over"" she whines at one point. Oh bubbala you and me both. Rating note The film contains gory violence and strong language.

Long overdue. Meets ""Schindlers List""? Hold on a minute. ""The Unborn"" is a baby-sitter horror flick (its for and about them) with classic creep-out elements that unite in a surprisingly engrossing story. Theres a missing mother a Gothic mental hospital bad dreams a lurking child with glowing blue eyes the possibility of an evil twin and demonic possession. The basis of it all though is the fear of getting pregnant. This movie knows its audience and its set in Chicago because if youre a Cubs fan it isnt hard to believe that Satan is at work. Casey (Odette Yustman who is in the Jennifer Connelly family of blank lookers who should be in magazines not movies) has bad dreams in which shes pursued by a little boy and discovers a fetus in a shallow grave. Also the toddler boy she baby-sits has been shining a mirror on his baby sisters face while mumbling ""Jumby wants to be born."" These words are pretty disturbing the first time the little blighter utters them and by the time they become the movies mantra they have a pronounced cooling effect on the blood. When Gary Oldman Jane Alexander and Carla Gugino bother to show up for a horror movie it threatens to be above average. This one is especially during the middle when Casey starts to piece together the details of her familys hidden past. This takes us back to . . . Nazi experiments? Tastewise writer-director David S. Goyer is crawling out there on the end of the limb of a tree he has set on fire. Do we really want a fantasy film that builds on the real horrors experienced by people still living? How did Goyer feel about himself when writing the line ""It has fallen on you to finish what began at Auschwitz""? Still the people at whom the movie is aimed were born in the 1990s. For them the Holocaust and the Middle Ages lie in approximately the same corner of the dusky past. They wont be bothered. Goyer is on firmer ground with the story of the Jewish demon - the dybbuk - a restless spirit of a dead person that can slip from one human body to the next at will. It particularly likes to use mirrors as portals between this world and the next. So theres another quintessential teen moment in which the heroine smashes every looking glass she can find. Most of the teens in the audience have probably felt like doing the same. I enjoyed the visual effects used to create some hellish creatures and the amusing nods to ""The Exorcist"" - cranial rotation even a spooky staircase. But the movie slips in the last act. Oldman as a rabbi who agrees to do an exorcism (instead of referring the girl to Father OLeary down the street) doesnt get any space to develop his character so there arent really any stakes for him. Idris Elba is even sketchier as an Episcopalian priest who drops in for no particular reason. As we rush through a climactic battle between good and evil the ground rules about what the dybbuk wants and how to defeat it arent clearly established. So theres this horrifying deadly legend - and yet it comes in such small portions. kyle.smithnypost.com THE UNBORN Fetal attraction. Running time 88 minutes.

(AP/Rogue Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday January 8 2009 336 PM Horror movie about a student possessed by an ancient demon. With Odette Yustman Gary Oldman (136). PG-13 violence language sexuality. At area theaters. ""We should all get our money back"" grumbled the guy sitting next to me as the lights went up after a recent showing of ""The Unborn."" The screening happened to be free so we actually had nothing to lose. But ignore his warning and you may not be so lucky. What ""The Exorcist"" might look like if Madonna rewrote it this silly fright flick finds college student Casey (Odette Yustman) haunted by a Kabbalistic demon. At first she thinks she might be going crazy She sees images of fetuses and howling dogs in her nightmares and has equally unsettling hallucinations during the day. But its when the little boy next door attacks her that she decides something seriously strange is going on. After Caseys father (James Remar) confesses that her twin brother died in utero she goes to visit her grandmother Sofi (Jane Alexander). Sofi explains that when she and her own twin brother were in Auschwitz a dybbuk -- the demon of Jewish folklore -- entered her brothers body. Apparently unable to find anything better to do hes been haunting the family ever since. Now its Caseys turn to play host. The only person who might be able to help her is Rabbi Sendak (Gary Oldman also apparently unable to find anything better to do). Though he takes a little convincing the rabbi finally agrees to perform an exorcism with help from the more experienced Father Wyndham (Idris Elba). The dybbuk we are told has been around for thousands of years. So you would think hed have more original tricks in his arsenal than broken light switches rattling doors and swarms of insects. Still at least writer/director David S. Goyer had the sense to boost these generic proceedings with pros like Alexander Oldman Elba and Carla Gugino who plays Caseys mother in a series of embarrassing flashbacks. Surely these fine actors signed on to the project solely because they believed in it with no thought to the car boat or Caribbean vacation the paycheck would provide. At some point however they may realize that this movie will haunt their resumes forever. And no spiritual incantation exists to erase it.

Often this involves starlet Odette Yustman approaching some obscured inevitably terrifying figure from behind very . . . very . . . slowly.Yustman plays Casey a well-heeled young Chicago-area suburbanite whos been having bad dreams. The night terrors begin to infest her waking life when while babysitting one of those whey-faced grade-schoolers who populate modern horror films as if by quota the kiddie cryptically intones ""Jumby wants to be born now."" (Not quite ""Theyre heeere"" granted.)Trying to figure out what exactly that means leads Casey and The Unborn into a thicket of exposition--involving suicided mothers Nazi mad geneticists kabbalah/Jewish folklore--from which it never returns (though it does leave a memorable pungency behind). A catnapping MPAA stamped this one with a PG-13 but you can still see our heroine in an out-of-body dream-float witnessing her own mutilation by some sinister moppet; the hallucinated return of the dead matriarch with a howling slimy saber-toothed skull; and an eruption of slopping slithering grub-like fingers grabbing at sweet hapless Casey.Yustmans ""character"" is basically skin-deep peeping views of her in various stages of intimacy her dramatic development (a view of the actresss pert butt in vacuum-wrapped panties is The Unborns international poster). Writer-director David Goyer (creator of the Blade franchise) is resourceful in maneuvering his muse into suggestively deviant setups; one scene sure to set any crowd abuzz with ""Wait really?"" anticipation has her putting her ear to a mysteriously whispering glory-hole in a nightclub bathroom stall (cue inadvertent flashbacks to Shawn Wayanss phallic de-braining in Scary Movie). During a penultimate exorcism she gets to model a ball gag.No The Unborn is not a remake of the little-loved 1991 Brooke Adams fertility clinic shocker of the same name (the VHS cover art of which mildly disturbed many younguns on trips to the neighborhood Video Time). The titular reference to from-the-womb haunting is only an afterthought; this Unborn more fully belongs to the durable exorcism subgenre. The cultural-milestone success of The Exorcist was sufficient to establish an entertainment cottage industry that has made room for Marvel Comics Ghost Rider a Blaxploitation spinoff (1974s Abby) and even a day-late Zucker-biting parody (Repossessed) with the 00s having seen a small-scale return of the cycle (Exorcist prequels Hex An American Haunting The Exorcism of Emily Rose).The Unborn however harkens back pre-Linda Blair to one of the earliest mass-culture manifestations of the roving-soul-looking-for-a-host-to-enter-the-corporeal-plane thing shtetl ethnologist S. Anskys 1920 smash of the Yiddish stage The Dybbuk (filmed by Micha Waszynski in 1937).Goyer may have changed the name and spiritual trappings but the symptoms of dybbuk possession are only as novel as their CGI here involving crab-walking while ones head twists backward. Old World Jewish superstition is reintroduced to an assimilated way-beyond-the-pale America as Casey and her BFF sidekick (""Do you believe in ghosts?"" ""You know I do"") follow hunches to a Holocaust survivor in a local rest home and to a Talmudic scholar (Rabbi Gary Oldman looking old man).Tracing the dybbuks birth to the concentration camps seems a stab at giving The Unborn--only superficially Semitic--a real cultural identity. This results in dialogue that either sounds cribbed from a Mens Adventure pulper (""The Nazis believed that twins could unravel the mysteries of the genetic"") or oversteps the jurisdiction of a shallow multiplex horror show (""It has fallen on you to finish what began in Auschwitz""). Blame it on the smartie horror-as-metaphor crowd.""Dybbuk"" instead of ""demon"" is just a matter of novel semantics here. The Unborn is one of those movies evidently conceived by digging a Dungeons amp; Dragons Fiend Folio out of storage to find resurrect and rebrand some long-forgotten bugaboo (e.g. the dusting-off of ""djinn"" to fill in for ""genie"" in Wishmaster). Given the cover-band constraints that rule in horror it seems a safe bet that someday soon well be menaced by such obscurantist horrors of lore as Baba Yaga Tailypo and David Gest.The final exorcism-by-committee performed in an abandoned asylum that looks like it was laid out by the Illinois chapter of the Knights Templar is a pan-denominational p.c. update of The Exorcists implicit verification of Catholicisms One True Faith--an eclectic outreach conference with everyone but an imam along for the ride. Tune out the battle royale bombast and start wondering where to eat after the movie.
