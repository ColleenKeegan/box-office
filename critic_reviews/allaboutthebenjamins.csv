This review was corrected on Apr. 24 2002. Boilerplate crime comedy is the coin of the realm in ""All About the Benjamins"" which amiably replays the now-familiar formula of unlikely partners in thievery all with the underlying hope that the Ice Cube-Mike Epps pairing is the start of a beautiful franchise. Veteran vid director Kevin Bray shows early signs in his debut feature that hes going to toy with every action movie effect within reach but then calms down and keeps his caper comedy on reasonably sound footing. Cube who is building a cottage industry of his own with distrib New Line calmly plays straight man to Epps riffing fool whose antics provide extremely mixed results for pics laugh quotient. Cube knows his aud and delivers just what they expect which means the Benjamins will be flowing. From the South Florida setting to Cubes bounty-hunter character Epps small-time con man and a range of Miami types the script by Ronald Lang and Cube resides precisely in Elmore Leonard territory. Its not hard to wish that Leonard himself had been given a swipe at the story in order to beef up characters and deepen the comedy since ""Benjamins"" shows the difference between mere formula and a fully developed crime yarn. Pre-title prelude establishes Cubes Bucum (sounds like ""book em"") as a wild man among bounty hunters busting in on the Everglades shack of his quarry Lil J (an especially mangy-looking Anthony Michael Hall). Bucums boss bail bondsman Martinez (Anthony Giaimo) refuses to insure this loose cannon and gives him the most irritating cases -- such as tracking down Epps Reggie. True to the code of the classic movie bounty man Bucum works alone refusing to invite eager bonds office secretary Pam (Valarie Rae Miller) along on his pursuits. Reggies intro is little more than an overlong showcase for Epps improvisations one of several times when the movie stops cold for the standup comic to do his thing. The action then picks up again as Bucum chases the lanky crook through the streets of Miamis South Beach. However this repeated stop-start motion harms the flow of the action-comedy and isnt nearly as smoothly calibrated as it was in pics obvious models ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Bad Boys."" What Bucum and Reggie dont realize is that theyre running right into an elaborate 20 million diamond heist overseen by the evil Williamson (Tommy Flanagan) and carried out by Julian (Roger Guenveur Smith) and Williamsons sultry but deadly g.f. Ursula (Carmen Chaplin granddaughter of Charlie). Hiding from Bucum in Julians van Reggie overhears that the diamond thieves have been double-crossed with fake rocks but before he manages to get away Reggie conveniently leaves his wallet -- containing a winning lottery ticket worth 60 million -- in the van. Bucum suspects something big is going down and thinks Reggie has the information he needs so they join forces against Williamson and his gang. Pic shifts nicely into caper mode featuring some nifty setpieces including a particularly Leonard-like scene where the good guys find the real diamonds at the bottom of a tropical fish tank. The script and Brays direction keep a tight lid on out-of-control wackiness in favor of the more businesslike approach that is Bucums m.o. An action finale does go a bit loopy but with enough of a nod to fans of ""Thunderball"" to keep things fairly amusing. The Cube-Epps combo is a tad rough around the edges and lacks that necessary friction of the better straight-man/comic pairings. Theyre best as a visual duo Cube is thick solid and a bit pudgy looking like he was born with a scowl; Epps is rubbery and antic his mouth his only weapon. With the right writer they may have a future together. Casting goes for broad types with strong thesps such as Flanagan and Smith. At first seeming to be just sexy bodies strutting for the camera Miller and Eva Mendes as Reggies g.f. provide their own doses of gal power. Lensing in extensive South Florida locales is slick though not overproduced while most of the action setpieces are somewhat less than state-of-the-art. NBA fans will puzzle at Bucums favorite garb a Miami Heat jersey embossed with the name of Tim Hardaway -- who was traded a while ago by the Heat to the Phoenix Suns.

Theres a subplot about Reggies lost winning ticket to a 60 million lottery stuff about the straight-man-jokester relationship between Bucum and Reggie and some souped-up post-""Miami Vice"" impressions of South Beach from music video-turned-first-time feature director Kevin Bray. A couple of gals (Eva Mendes and Valarie Rae Miller) tag along after their guys; a scarfaced Scottish baddie (Tommy Flanagan) gets tough on the boys in a speedboat; a couple of doggies bolt out of the blocks during a shoot-out at a racetrack. Actually ""All About the Benjamins"" is all about extending the Cube/Epps franchise following their pairing in 1999s ""Next Friday"" which may have been a commercially successful comedy partnership but which aint no rockin 1995 Cube-and-Chris-Tucker ""Friday"" either. I dont know if Cube is melting as he warms up his persona to be all things to all audiences - tough but tender rap-real but corporate-ready - or if Epps off-spin discount-Tucker prattle is slowing Cubes game. But something puddles to nothing in this relentless Miami sun.

"Benjamins All About Epps washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Benjamins All About Epps Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday March 8 2002 YOU GOTTA LAUGH. Not just because ""All About the Benjamins"" is so bullet-riddled with hip-hop cliches someone ought to draw a chalk outline around it. But you also gotta chuckle because Mike Epps has the shamelessness -- and enough comic talent -- to play Eddie Murphy Chris Tucker Damon Wayans and everyone else who has filled the jive turkey role in an action movie. Its old hat but hes funny. Ice Cubes the straight man the one pushing the story along. Hes a Miami bounty hunter named Bucum Jackson whos hired to pick up con man Reggie Wright (Epps). But when Reggie makes a break for it the two men stumble into Robert Williamson (Tommy Flanagan) a rather nasty Scot whos busy stealing 20 million in diamonds. One groan-inducing familiarity begets another. Bucum and Reggie become temporary partners with complementary goals. Bucum wants to catch Williamson and get enough street cred to launch his own P.I. firm. Reggie needs to retrieve the winning lottery ticket he dropped while running away from Williamsons goons. And neither of them is going to say no to those diamonds. The less said about this not-ready-for-""Miami-Vice"" script with its requisite speedboat finale the better. Of course Ice Cube (also an executive producer on the film) doesnt hurt for screen time or likability. But hes the official frowner the disapprover. He hits people. He shoots people. Hes always pulling the gun from his back pocket. But Epps shoots from the lip. As Reggie he whines like a kid when he doesnt get his way. He imitates people who annoy him right in their faces. He does all the physical business too -- falling on his head from a great height swinging uselessly when hes caught in a fight. And he cusses re-cusses and triple-cusses no matter whats happening. Hes a one-man show disguised as a character. You can laugh with or without irony. Or you can simply stay away. -- Desson Howe ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS (R 99 minutes) -- Contains violence relentless obscenity sexual situations and not a scintilla of originality. Area theaters.

"USATODAY.com - All About Benjamins all about offensive gags Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/08/2002 - Updated 0911 AM ET All About Benjamins all about offensive gags By Claudia Puig USA TODAY All About Benjamins (out of four) Stars Ice Cube Mike Epps Eva Mendes Tommy Flanagan Rating R for strong violence pervasive language and brief sexuality New in theaters The title All About the Benjamins refers to 100 bills which are printed with Benjamin Franklins face. And this buddy action flick as that title implies is all about the almighty dollar and the quest to grab a wad of it. Ice Cube and Mike Epps play Miami hustlers who team up to retrieve Epps wallet containing a winning lottery card from the clutches of sleazy diamond thieves. The thieves have bigger fish to fry than a pilfered billfold Theyre intent on getting the annoying duo off their trail -- permanently. Read more below Video Benjamins trailer The action unfolds at a frenetic pace -- the cuts are quick chase scenes careen and bullets fly -- to the pulsing soundtrack of Latin-flavored and hip-hop tunes. The music especially conveys a rich sense of Miamis sultry appeal but the rest doesnt add up to much. The buddies themselves are bummers. Ice Cube -- with a powerful presence but limited acting range -- occasionally pulls off well-timed withering remarks but mostly hes sullen. Epps meanwhile tries to liven up the screen with slapstick energy. While at times he manages to be endearingly goofy he often comes off hyper or verging on hysterical. Their contrasting personalities provide some of the rare laugh-worthy scenes but they are far outnumbered by lame offensive gags. When Ice Cube commands Epps to jump from atop a stationary yacht with his hands bound behind his back Epps replies ""You think Im gonna jump off here and end up like Christopher Reeve?"" Such tastelessness might be tolerable if there were a touch of originality but the action cliches just pile up. When Ice Cube and Epps think theyve finished off the baddest of the bad guys he rises up from his nearly dead state and attacks but not until (what a surprise) were supposed to think our heroes are safe. Nearly everyone good bad or irrelevant is armed and the amount of gunplay makes a shootem-up Western seem like gun-control propaganda. Theres gruesome bloodletting and other bad behavior thats so overdone it loses its shock value. At one point the pair tortures a villain with a broken arm by twisting pins on his cast with a screwdriver. Wince-inducing at first but its shown over and over and over. Such overkill might seem like an asset to teenage boys (and those who think like them). The rest of us are better off not wasting our Washingtons.

Photo Tracy Bennett/New Line Cinema (HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT Ice Cubes latest lacks payoff / Benjamins funny despite poor script 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS Action comedy. Starring Ice Cube and Mike Epps. Directed by Kevin Bray. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The team of Ice Cube and Mike Epps made a very funny picture called ""Next Friday"" a couple of years ago. In ""All About the Benjamins"" they try to move from low-down laughs into an action-comedy on the order of Eddie Murphy s ""48 HRS."" but something is off. Actually everything is off. ""All About the Benjamins"" is the strange case of a movie that clunks in every possible way but the ultimate way -- it entertains. We can talk about tone problems script problems jokes that fall flat and scenes that just lie there but sit people down in front of it and they wont necessarily want to go away. At least they wont run away screaming. Cube plays a Miami bounty hunter who in the course of chasing a con man (Epps) finds himself getting shot at by a scary pack of jewel thieves. From this a complicated story -- a little too complicated -- spins out in which the bounty hunter and the con man team up to find the jewels. Everyone in the movie is after money -- everyone is all about the Benjamins as in the currency with Benjamin Franklins picture on it. Epps goes a long way toward making the picture work. Playing a con artist he gets plenty of chances to talk in a stream of nonsensical bluster. He also has some nice moments of physical shtick in which he bluffs that hes a fighter even though its clear from the way he throws punches that he cant fight at all. In ""Next Friday"" Epps wiry manic energy made him the ideal sidekick for the beefy and somber Cube but in ""All About the Benjamins"" the pairing doesnt work as well. Here Ice Cube is too somber. He plays variations on one note -- mild irritation -- for most of the movie. Cube has shown more nuance in the past -- that impassive facade can be a comic instrument -- but here he is working with people who are not bringing out his best. He collaborated on the screenplay with Ronald Lang a writer making his debut and the result often seems amateurish. Throughout characters keep announcing their motives in the course of clumsy explanatory conversations. Arguments are used incessantly to convey information. If that werent bad enough the arguments arent shaped dramatically. The picture was directed by Kevin Bray a video director who until now had never made a feature. Key moments arent pointed. Actors are clearly left to fend for themselves. Its a mess. The actors also seem to have been given license to improvise. With a performer of Epps ability thats freedom to flower. Everyone else is lost. Its a tendency of actors -- let them improvise and all they do is insert the f-word twice in every sentence. Theres a lot of that here. Still I cant totally trash a movie that I halfway enjoyed. The plot holds interest and the lurid Miami atmosphere has its allure. Best of all theres the outrageousness of the humor -- downright nasty references to Christopher Reeve and Oprah Winfrey for example -- that makes Ice Cube an original voice. Advisory This film contains graphic violence and strong language.
