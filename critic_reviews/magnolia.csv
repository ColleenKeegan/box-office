More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

But its also one of the most enthralling and exhilarating American movies in ages. Much in the style of Nashville and Short Cuts (though lacking Altmans light touch) this intimate epic charts the various fortunes over a day or so of various individuals living in the San Fernando Valley - including the dying Earl (Robards) his young wife Linda (Moore) and his nurse Phil (Hoffman); Frank Mackey (Cruise) prophet of machismo; and numerous people associated past or present with a TV quiz show - whose paths cross by design destiny chance or coincidence. Insofar as the film is about story little happens save that Anderson initially conceals information and then slowly scatters snippets so that we can piece the jigsaw together. For all the humour its a dark portrait of loss lovelessness and fear of failure in contemporary America and not a film that trades in understatement. As the lost souls make their way towards - what? - redemption? - a deus ex machina plot development occurs as contrived ludicrous bold and grandly imaginative as any Biblical flood or plague.

But they keep trying. Paul Thomas Andersons ambitious sprawling mess of a film ""Magnolia"" is Altman-esque in every sense of the word. Which is to say that it fluctuates wildly between great crazy and nearly intolerable. ""Altman-esque"" is one of those film-critic adjectives -- like ""Capra-esque"" and ""Hitchcockian"" -- that implies a lot more than you usually end up seeing on the screen. VIDEO Theatrical preview for ""Magnolia"" QuickTime Play Real 28K 80K Windows Media 28K 80K Boiled down to its essence an Altman-esque film has anywhere from 10 to 20 main characters; multiple plot threads that seem virtually unrelated until the final 15 minutes; a running time of nearly three hours; and a loopy sense of timing that allows for tons of rambling dialogue and oddball psychological quirks. Its a rich stew and Altman makes the coolest films youve ever seen when he gets the ingredients right. ""MASH"" (1970) ""McCabe amp; Mrs. Miller"" (1971) ""The Long Goodbye"" (1973) ""California Split"" (1974) ""Nashville"" (1975) ""The Player"" (1992) and chunks of ""Short Cuts"" (1993) are vivid provocative tapestries of the American experience. But that 17-year gap between ""Nashville"" and ""The Player"" says a lot. The balance of this kind of film is so precarious that Altman himself botches it more often than he succeeds. And when he botches it he does so with a vengeance. ""Magnolia"" is Andersons follow-up to his 1997 hit ""Boogie Nights."" That movie although too long and too indebted to Martin Scorseses visual sense is a tremendously entertaining film that holds up the porn industry as a microcosm of modern American life. Just as he did in ""Boogie Nights"" Anderson wrings startling performances from most his ""Magnolia"" cast members. But the restrictions of dissecting only porn usually held him in check with ""Boogie Nights."" This time hes reaching for existential angst. And there arent clear-cut parameters when it comes to that concept. He ends up with a swirling series of sometimes inconsequential tangents a number of which would have been better off lying on the editing room floor. ALSO Chat William H. Macy on ""Magnolia"" Mamet and more MESSAGE BOARD Does ""Magnolia"" have Academy potential? Share your thoughts on the Oscar hopefuls. Cast of thousands Theres so much going on here that the best approach is to simply list the characters and tell you what each ones particular problem is. As in ""Short Cuts"" from which Anderson obviously takes most of his cues these people are uniformly miserable. Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) Bedridden Earl is dying of cancer and wants to be reunited with his long-estranged son before meeting his maker. Robards is one of the finest actors in the world and he gives another moving performance here as a man wracked with spiritual as well as physical pain. Hes so good its sometimes hard to watch him. Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) Earls wife Linda finds that shes finally falling in love with her husband just as hes dying. She married Earl solely for his money but now realizes that hes her badly needed lifeline. Moores innate sexiness is often drowned by Lindas gloomy self-absorption. It gives her room to experiment. Anderson allows her to overheat a lot and she does it dramatically. But the character is often more shrill than tortured. Frank Mackey (Tom Cruise) Frank is a pumped-up TV self-help guru. But his self-help is also self-centered. Hes a distastefully narcissistic expert on how to seduce and dump women in the cruelest manner possible. Whooping groups of chauvinist pigs pay thousands of dollars for Franks profane guidance. Cruise is nearly unwatchable in what has to be the most grating ""performance"" of his career. Hes always been one to confuse staring laser beams through his fellow actors with thespian passion. But Frank looks like hes constantly lifting weights even when hes just sitting there. It can drive you nuts after a couple of scenes especially given the high quality the other performances. Kudos to Cruise for appearing in an ensemble cast but hes not about to let anybody forget that hes Tom Terrific the big fat movie star. The results are plain old obnoxious. Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman) Stanley is a child genius whos become a minor celebrity as the star of a popular TV quiz show. He hates his father for making him participate in the media circus but Stanley is probably the most expendable character in the script. God only knows why hes there. He certainly doesnt accomplish much aside from serving as a reflection of one characters past experience. Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) Donnie was the star of Stanleys quiz show back in the 1960s when he was just a kid. Now however hes a world-class schmuck. Hes sexually repressed and cant even hold down a simple job at an electronics store. People are constantly recognizing him as ""that smart kid from TV"" although hes now in his mid-40s and doesnt know a damned thing about forging a proper adult existence. Macy plays losers as well as anyone in the world and Donnie is a meaty character. His desperate robbery of his former employers is so ill-advised that even he starts to wonder why he did it two minutes after hes done. Macy is spectacular and is one of the bravest actors weve got. He wallows in his characters ineptitude as much as Cruise shouts out his characters world-beating strength. Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) The weary heavy-drinking host of the quiz show Jimmy is also diagnosed with terminal cancer and suddenly has to come to terms with his own mortality. Hall is especially good with slow-moving panic and his craggy features serve him well. Jimmy is one of the films more complex characters. He eventually has to admit to some horrific missteps during his life. The anguish keeps mounting through the film and Jimmy gets more than his fair share. Claudia Wilson Gator (Melora Walters) Jimmys estranged daughter (you can see how unrelated stories bounce off of each other in key ways) Claudia is a coke head whos too wired to acknowledge when people are concerned for her well-being. She also gets irritating a little too often. But she turns out to be one of the more blessed characters before its all over. Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) The heart and soul of the entire story Jim is a kind somewhat dimwitted protector of the public. He skips through the story line as one of the few characters who really wants to help someone beside himself. Theres an amusing core of decency to Jim that often keeps the film anchored when things threaten to spin out of control. Reilly is astonishing. He finds unexpected tenderness in the character and his fumbling declarations of integrity come from somewhere deep inside Officer Kurring. You walk away remembering more about this performance than anything else in the movie. ""Magnolia"" establishes Reilly as one of our premiere character actors. Its one of the best performances of the year. Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) Hoffman fully redeems himself after surprisingly mundane work in the recently released ""Flawless."" Phil is Earl Partridges at-home caretaker and the person responsible for locating his estranged son. Hoffman spends most of his time responding to Robards death-rattle soliloquies; he almost seems to take the old mans pain into himself as he listens. This is a rather small role but one that makes an indelible imprint. Hoffman like Reilly is the conscience of a story that badly needs one.

In its ambitious scope and grand operatic style ""Magnolia"" Paul Thomas Andersons eagerly awaited followup to ""Boogie Nights"" confirms his status as one of the most audacious filmmakers in Hollywood today. This imposing tapestry about the mysterious workings of fate and coincidence and the need for interconnection and love interweaves the stories of a dozen characters as they embark on a moral odyssey during one intense day in their tumultuous lives. A superlative ensemble headed by Tom Cruise (in his best dramatic turn to date) Jason Robards Melora Walters and Julianne Moore gives this meditation on urban alienation the aura of a major work highly in tune with the zeitgeist. But a running time of more than three hours the largely downbeat tone and other demands on viewers will curtail pics commercial appeal resulting in moderate B.O. Self-discipline not talent is the major issue in Andersons career. In his new movie as in the previous ones he proves to be an astute writer making sharp observations about the human condition a flamboyant high-voltage visual stylist and a terrific actors director -- here he coaxes splendid performances from a cast that consists of about 30 speaking parts. What Anderson lacks however is restraint in telling his complex postmodern tale. ""Magnolia"" suffers not only from an exorbitant running time but from the excessive abrasive visual approach and musical mode including several repetitive montages in which the fractured tale unfolds. Despite rave reviews ""Boogie Nights"" didnt play well in the plexes due to its subject matter the porn industry. But those who saw it were surprised by the sweet nature of the saga which succeeded in making its offbeat characters accessible and likable. The problems with ""Magnolia"" arguably a more ambitious and mature work are not so much thematic as structural and stylistic. A brief prologue which sets the films disturbing tone presents three acts of violence jumping among a 1911 prison yard a 1958 tenement and the early 1980s. Accompanied by voiceover narration this unconventional overture signals pics dominant motifs the role of chance in life and the notion that ""strange things happen all the time."" At the center of the elaborate maze set in the San Fernando Valley area of L.A. is patriarch Earl Partridge (Robards) a dying man whos forced to come to terms with his failures -- specifically cheating on his loyal first wife and irresponsibly walking out on her leaving their only son Frank Mackey (Cruise) to care for his mother when shes sick with cancer. Earl is now married to the much younger Linda (Moore) who tends to be hysterical and cant deal with his impending death. The burdensome routines of his care are carried out by Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a devoted nurse whos unable to separate his professional duties from his emotional involvement with Earl. Refusing to see Earl or even acknowledge his existence Frank is a seductive guru who runs popular high-priced seminars that teach angry frustrated men how to get their way with women. Frank markets his philosophy -- ""Respect the Cock"" -- in brilliantly staged sequences that are more unsettling than the similarly themed scenes in ""The Fight Club."" As with all the characters a chain of weird circumstances forces Frank to come to terms with his family and past. The most emotionally engaging -- and splendidly acted -- story centers on the travails of a compassionate religious cop Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) whos prone to babbling about the importance of ""doing good and helping others."" During one of his routine calls Jim drops in on Claudia (Melora Walters) a high-strung woman whos addicted to drugs and loud music. Their interaction begins with yelling and screaming with Claudia insisting that she wants to be left alone but eventually she consents to go out on a date with Jim and a tentative courtship follows. The weakest section (which could be cut by half) is a TV quiz game hosted by veteran Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) who is Claudias father. This yarn brings to the surface the conflict between Rick Spector (Michael Bowen) a father living off the brilliance of his genius son Stanley (Jeremy Blackman). Anderson introduces his dramatis personae in a bold original manner constructing for each character a parallel or an opposite. Stanley is juxtaposed with Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) a 60s quiz show star whos now reduced to a routine job at an electronics store hoping that some pricey dental work will provide his salvation and bring much needed love to his dull existence. The narrative is divided into three parts designated by titles that describe the weather (""light showers high humidity""). The organizing principle of the sprawling material is that of the duo with each interaction marked by the changing balance of power and control. This is particularly evident in the relationships between professionals and their patients or clients; Linda attacks her pharmacist TV game players disobey their host and his rules various residents scream at the well-meaning cop. If ""Boogie Nights"" was unmistakably influenced by Scorseses style ""Magnolia"" which is named after a boulevard near which most of the action unfolds invites comparison to Altmans ""Short Cuts"" and to John Sayles political drama ""City of Hope"" two mosaics of American life woven through a series of darkly comic vignettes. All three films present a poignant portrait of human and urban malaise underlined by hidden elements of a crisis that threatens to erupt. Similar to Altman who employed the device of an earthquake to unify his self-absorbed characters Anderson uses a ferocious and surreal rain of frogs to bring his lonely characters together. But ""Magnolia"" avoids the bitter and cynical tone of ""Short Cuts"" ending with a series of emotionally satisfying reconciliations. And it lacks ""City of Hopes"" schematic melodrama; Anderson views all his characters with empathy. With a style thats full of quirks and surprises he turns a perceptive gaze on such traditional American traits as unbridled materialism and uncontrollable dependency on the mass media as well as such values as monogamous marriage and familial love. Ace lenser Robert Elswit works wonders with his dynamic mobile camera. In a bravura sequence that borrows from opera and musical theater all the characters burst out singing with the camera conveying their disparate locations and moods. The interdependent plot lines are set to the songs of Aimee Mann whose music becomes part of the films warp and weft. Her title song ""Save Me"" fits the films melancholy mood like a silk glove. Peppered with beguiling appearances (with luminous turns by Cruise Walters Hall and Reilly) and piercing commentary on both estrangement and renewal ""Magnolia"" is a remarkably inventive and audacious film that almost overcomes its flaws.

"Magnolia | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; magnolia ) Magnolia (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli With Magnolia director Paul Thomas Anderson has segued into the realm of the three hour movie. Its an ambitious step to take - making lengthy ensemble movies with tangentially related and occasionally interconnected storylines can be a risky endeavor both creatively and financially. When it works and everything snaps into focus the rewards can be great but when it fails the finished product often looks worse than the mangled wreckage of a head-on car crash. Fortunately Anderson has a deft hand when it comes to filmmaking and this project does not tax his talent beyond the breaking point. Magnolia is a fascinating and worthwhile motion picture that manages to keep viewers interested in the plights of ten different characters for nearly its full length - right up to and through the improbable climax. Anderson is one of only a few recent directors who has shown growth in each of his first three outings. His motion picture debut Hard Eight was an intriguing but uneven character study of an older man and his surrogate son. Boogie Nights pulled no punches in chronicling the rise and fall of a top porn star during the late 70s and early 80s. Now Magnolia presents a slice-of-life look at a group of characters whose fates are intertwined even though their paths dont necessarily intersect during the course of this film. One can argue whether Boogie Nights or Magnolia is the more accomplished feature but theres no debating that Magnolia represents the greater challenge. It also features one of the most audacious plot developments ever to grace the silver screen. Anderson does something so outrageous during the films final 30 minutes that jaws will drop throughout the theater. In order to get a sense of where Magnolia is going it is necessary to introduce the various characters. At the center of events is Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) a television producer who stricken by cancer lies on his deathbed. His young wife Linda (Julianne Moore) is desolate with grief and guilt and has trouble coping with her impending loss. His estranged son Frank Mackey (Tom Cruise) the charismatic guru of the ""Seduce and Destroy"" lifestyle has worked hard to sever all connections with Earl. His nurse Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) seeks to fulfill his employers dying wish and reunite him with Frank. Meanwhile Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) who is the host of Earls most popular TV show the long-running ""What Do Kids Know?"" also has terminal cancer. Like Earl and Frank a rift exists between him and his child. When he attempts a reconciliation with Claudia (Melora Walters) she rebuffs him. Later she embarks on a strange relationship with a gentle but ineffectual police officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly). And Jimmy must explain to his wife Rose (Melinda Dillon) why Claudia hates him so intensely. At the same time Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman) a child genius on Jimmys show finds that the only way to get his fathers attention is to win money. And as Stanley continues to answer questions right a former quiz show star Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) watches the remains of his life go up in smoke. Together these characters make up the leaves and branches of this tree. In essence Magnolia deals with the effects of physical and spiritual cancer on individuals and families. Earl and Jimmy who are in many ways mirror images of each other are afflicted with both forms of the malady. And while their bodies have previously been untouched they have been emotionally diseased for years. Like a reverse Midas touch this malaise has spread to everyone close to them. Claudia is a drug abuser with no self-confidence. Frank hides behinds a misogynist image he has created. Linda is suicidal. Even the ex-quiz kid and current contestant on ""What Do Kids Know?"" have deep-rooted problems. The only exemptions to this pervasive ailment of the soul are Jim Kurring and Phil Parma who do not have lasting connections to any of the other characters. Three hours is a long time to keep an audience involved and Anderson almost pulls it off. There is a bit of a lag during the early part of the third hour but a surprising incident of almost Biblical proportions re-invigorates the proceedings. This will undoubtedly be the most hotly debated aspect of the film. For some it will ruin an otherwise keenly observed study of human behavior and interaction. However for those who share my opinion it will elevate the movie to a new level. Nothing prepared me for Magnolias conclusion and for that I am grateful. One of the reasons the movies energy level remains high is because of the way Anderson and cinematographer Robert Elswit (who collaborated on Hard Eight and Boogie Nights) vary Magnolias visual style. Aside from the usual variety of quick cuts and close-ups there are an unusually large number of long unbroken takes. One is a tracking shot that follows different characters through the behind-the-scenes halls of the quiz show. Another keeps the camera in a room while two characters drift in and out. There are also some oddball moments such as when characters sing along with a song on the soundtrack. In fact music in general plays an important part in Andersons approach. Not only are Aimee Manns songs carefully woven into the movies fabric but the score by Jon Brion is almost omnipresent. During Magnolias first two hours nearly every scene has background music. Only during the third hour are there a significant number of traditionally scored sequences. Although Magnolias ending will generate most of the films buzz the movie begins with an enjoyably offbeat prologue that is set across three time periods 1911 (with the hanging of three criminals) 1958 (with the homicide of a man attempting to commit suicide) and the early 1980s (with the inadvertent death of a man in a fire fighting operation). These three disconnected segments are meant to illustrate that some events regardless of how strange or hard-to-swallow they may be occur simply as a matter of chance. In a universe of infinite possibilities all things no matter how improbable can happen. In addition to being interesting in their own right these pre-title sequences help prepare the audience for what will occur 150 minutes later. In a film of many strengths nothing ranks higher in Magnolia than the quality of acting. From top to bottom there isnt a weak link in the cast. However when it comes to Oscar nominations the movie will likely have a problem. Because this is an ensemble piece with nearly everyone getting equal time there are no leads and everyone cant be nominated in the supporting categories. Regardless of what the Academy decides that doesnt negate the fact that there are several deserving performers. Leading the list is Tom Cruise who gives one of the best performances of his career (if not the best). Those disappointed by the actors work in the recent Kubrick film will have their eyes opened wide by his effort here. He plays Frank with the fervor of an evangelist and its a riveting portrayal. Equally effective are Jason Robards and Melora Walters and the rest of the acting troupe isnt far behind. For Magnolia Anderson has brought on board a number of repeat contributors. A significant portion of the cast of Boogie Nights has been re-united including Julianne Moore Melora Walters John C. Reilly William H. Macy Philip Baker Hall Luis Guzman Philip Seymour Hoffman and Alfred Molina. Of those four - Walters Reilly Hoffman and Hall - also appeared in Hard Eight. Its a testimony to the directors craft and dedication that so many fine actors have sought additional opportunities to work with him. Not since Robert Altmans Short Cuts have we seen such a finely-tuned ensemble piece. Yet a direct comparison between the two films would be somewhat misleading. Thematically at least when considering the role played by chance there are similarities but Altman used a different more languid style than Anderson does. Magnolia is a kinetic picture that doesnt stop moving and rarely stays with one story for more than a couple of minutes before moving to the next. This approach allows us to get to know the principals quickly and keeps us engaged by all of the storylines. (The tendency in this sort of movie is for the viewer to focus on one or two characters and in the process lose interest in the rest.) Magnolia is admittedly not for everyone but those who ""get"" the film are in for something that ranks as more of a cinematic experience than a mere movie.

Macy Julianne Moore Felicity Huffman John C. Reilly; Director Paul Thomas Anderson; Author Paul Thomas Anderson; Runtime (in minutes) 188; MPAA Rating R; Distributor New Line Cinema Posted December 29 1999 -- 1200 AM EST A street in Californias San Fernando Valley lends ""Magnolia"" its perfumed name. But the botanical implications are apt Paul Thomas Andersons big showy flower of a movie unfurls brilliantly each plot petal a thing of exquisite design. Then it ripens. Then it disintegrates leaving a mess of color and a faint whiff of rot. Anderson of course would probably say that rot - specifically the rot that infests California family life - is what interests him most. The prodigiously original filmmaker who recognized the family ties among 1970s porn brokers two years ago in ""Boogie Nights"" here dwells on anger and remorse love and forgiveness parents and children in interlocking stories that take place on one meteorologically unstable day A rich dying man (Jason Robards) tended by his distraught younger wife (Julianne Moore) and a compassionate nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) wants to reconcile with his estranged son (Tom Cruise) a strutting high-priced self-help guru who teaches hurting men how to ""seduce and destroy."" Another rich man a quiz-show host (Philip Baker Hall) just beginning to die tries in vain to make peace with his furious cocaine-stoked daughter (Melora Walters). And throughout the aching songs of Aimee Mann run as a musical ribbon binding these trembling buds into one bouquet. ""Magnolia"" has been compared to Robert Altmans bitter 1993 assemblage ""Short Cuts"" for its mosaic approach to storytelling (and its La-La Land ethos). But the connection exists only superficially. Inventive excess-addicted Anderson leaves his elder far behind in his emotional warm-heartedness (he like Reillys good cop loves even the most wretched of characters) as well as in the infectious pleasure he takes in choreographing grand-scale chaos. Anderson adores giant steps and big (even biblical) portents and hed rather err with too much - as there is here in a tangle of too-long too-showy scenes - than hand off a retentively neat arrangement. Its with Cruise as Frank T.J. Mackey a slick televangelist of penis power that the filmmaker scores his biggest success as the actor exorcises the uptight fastidiousness of ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Preening and trash-talking Cruise - whose erotic charms have always been displayed wrapped in cellophane - blossoms into a man of potency. Like John Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction"" this cautiously packaged movie star is liberated by risky business. Asking for and granting forgiveness in modern life is also risky business but oh this overblown exotic bloom of a movie says how beautiful it can be.

Starring Tom Cruise and John C. Reilly. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. (Rated R. 180 minutes. VHS.) Any director who shuffles the stories of nine major characters over the course of three solid hours as Paul Thomas Anderson does had better come up with a flabbergasting climax. In ""Magnolia"" damned if he doesnt. It all comes together to demonstrate in case we didnt know already just how comic terrifying and unpredictable life can be. In the most amazing performance of many here Tom Cruise plays the charismatic guru of a cultish self-help ""seminar"" for would- be macho lady-killers. He teaches them how to ""Seduce and Destroy."" The role of Frank T.J. Mackey demands a mesmerizing performance and Cruise delivers one. ""Magnolia"" is a kaleidoscope of twisting images and stories of intersecting lives in the San Fernando Valley as an old man (Jason Robards) is on his deathbed with cancer. Julianne Moore is his neurotic wreck of a guilty wife. John C. Reilly (""Boogie Nights"") is the magnificently decent police officer who holds the moral compass in the film. A burly lonely heart he watches ""Today"" works out prays and calls in his personals ads. As he goes about his duties and interrogates strangers in their apartments the off-balance tone can be both comic and ominous. William H. Macy is a has-been television quiz kid and Jeremy Blackman his contemporary 11- year-old counterpart. In these two we seem to be witnessing the past and present of the same character. The cast just doesnt stop. Theres Philip Seymour Hoffman who has piled up an astounding resume of character roles (""Happiness"" ""Boogie Nights"" ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"") as the dying mans pasty-faced nurse and Philip Baker Hall as a TV icon at the end of the trail. At times Anderson may be too brilliant for his own good and there is a risk that viewers will tire of the directors relentlessly prowling camera. They may think the movie is never going to end.
