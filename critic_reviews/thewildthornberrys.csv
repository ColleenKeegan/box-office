Comments The Wild Thornberrys Movie A spin-off from the animated kids series that debuted on Nickelodeon in 1998 this antic feature finds the title family traveling through Africa to film episodes for a wildlife TV show. Eliza the plucky 12-year-old heroine can communicate with animals and with a chimp sidekick she escapes from her English boarding school to rescue noble elephants from evil poachers. Screenwriter Kate Boutilier provides plenty of sharp patter (in one scene Elizas bored older sister gives their father a tutorial on teen sarcasm) and Paul Simon contributed the catchy song ""Father and Daughter."" Directed by Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian and featuring the voices of Brenda Blethyn Tim Curry Rupert Everett Lynn Redgrave Marisa Tomei and Alfre Woodard. 88 min.

The star of The Wild ThornberrysMovie has the carrot-colored braids of Pippi Longstocking and the fearless dedication to animals of a young Jane Goodall. Mischievous tyke Donnie roams the wild in Thornberrys. The spunky adventuress runs with chimps and cheetahs eagerly exploring the African savannahs. She also rides rapids jumps off a moving train dangles from a helicopter and single-handedly saves a herd of elephants from poachers. The animated redhead is the gutsiest young female heroine to hit the big screen since the live-action ladies in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The movie opens with Eliza (voiced by Lacey Chabert) in the Serengeti Plain with her family. Nigel Thornberry (Tim Curry) is an intrepid Brit who hosts a wildlife documentary show. His wife Marianne (Jodi Carlisle) is the shows equally intrepid photographer. Their teenage daughter Debbie (Danielle Harris) is a sarcastic Valley girl transplanted to the savannah. Four-year-old Donnie (Flea) is a lovable hellion they found roaming in the wild. Visiting from England are Nigels parents Grandmumsy Cordelia (Lynn Redgrave) and Grandpapa the Colonel (Tim Curry again). Theyre a loving if eccentric family. Movie review The Wild Thornberrys Movie ( out of four) Stars Lacey Chabert Tim Curry Jodi Carlisle Danielle Harris Tome Kane Lynn Redgrave Rupert Everett Alfre Woodard Directors Jeff McGrath Cathy Malkasion Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG adventure peril Opens Friday nationwide Elizas chimp Darwin (Tom Kane) has the manner of a British dandy. We know this because he and Eliza share many conversations. Her special gift for communicating with animals was bestowed upon her by a magic shaman. This ability kept secret from her parents does not keep her from getting into trouble. After she ventures too far from home with her animal companions she is sent off to boarding school in London punishment for Eliza and a dream trip for Debbie who would give anything to ditch the African bush for a big city. Debbie stays Eliza goes Darwin stows away. The adventure kicks into gear when she runs away from the boarding school back to Africa to rescue a baby cheetah from the clutches of a pair of evil poachers (Rupert Everett and Marisa Tomei). The movie features a musical score aimed more at boomer parents than their tykes with original songs by Paul Simon Peter Gabriel and Dave Matthews. The lilting lullaby Father and Daughter is classic Simon Im gonna watch you shine/ Gonna watch you grow/As long as one and one is two/ There could never be a father who loved his daughter more than I love you. The Wild Thornberrys will no doubt brighten the day of parents looking for family activities during the holidays.

Darwin Eliza and Phaedra the elephant are three characters in ""The Wild Thornberrys Movie."" FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ANTWONE FISHER Drama. Starring Derek Luke and Denzel Washington. Directed by Washington. (PG- 13. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The best thing most Denzel Washington movies have going for them is Denzel Washington and thats the case with ""Antwone Fisher"" in which he plays the fatherly psychiatrist of a troubled young sailor. Washington also directed the film and as a director his hand is less assured. His film has warmth and integrity but it lacks the urgency of a story that had to be told. Based on a true story the movie stars Derek Luke as the title character a sailor with a chip on his shoulder who keeps getting into fights. This brings him to the attention of a Navy shrink named Davenport (Washington) who gradually persuades the man to tell the story of his childhood a dead father a criminal mother a sadistic foster mother and a sexually abusive baby sitter. The director Washington is acutely aware of the actor Washingtons strengths. He knows for example that he is the best in the world at looking concerned and calling a younger man ""son"" with the perfect mix of authority and comfort. Washington has been throwing ""sons"" around since at least ""Courage Under Fire"" made when he was barely past 40. He makes me wish hed call me son and hes not much older than I am. Washington has a harder time directing Luke who does everything hes asked to do but should have been asked to do more. For the journey of Antwone to pay off fully there needs to be a journey from darkness to light. But Antwone is not a bad fellow to begin with and Washington lets scenes settle too soon into reasonableness. He may have also been hampered by the script written by the real Antwone Fisher which by adhering to the truth makes us wonder Why this story? As it stands its the story of a clean-cut kid who becomes an even nicer clean-cut kid. Washington also allows his director of photography Philippe Rousselot to film entire scenes in deep shadows. What is a first-time director to do when up against a cinematographer and a French one at that with a massive resume? Next time out Washington will have learned to crack the whip. . This film contains mild strong language. -- Mick LaSalle THE WILD THORNBERRYS MOVIE Animated comedy. Starring Lynn Redgrave Tim Curry and Marisa Tomei. Directed by Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian. Written by Kate Boutilier. (PG. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Everyone in the Thornberry family has skinny little arms and legs and a head the size of a watermelon. Good thing they are animated characters. ""The Wild Thornberrys"" is the latest concept to jump from the Nickelodeon Network from TV to the big screen. Although it may not get an Academy Award nomination like ""Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius"" it is a perfect antidote to the inevitable Christmas vacation cabin fever. Pack up the kids hit the multiplex and relax. Youre in good hands. As the Thornberry fan in your house will be happy to explain to you Eliza is the star of the show. Twelve years old she can communicate with animals which is lucky because her best friend is a chimpanzee named Darwin. She also gets to speak elephant whale and lizard while her mother and father are traveling the world filming a nature documentary show. The movie wastes little time explaining who is who however. Out playing with cheetah cubs on the African plain Eliza is unable to stop a poacher who swoops down in a helicopter and grabs one of the little cats. And were off rambling all over the map from African watering holes to a snooty British boarding school. Eliza has to save the cub find the poachers and thwart a plot to kill elephants for their ivory. It is all done not only with perfect political correctness -- no gunfights or inappropriate language -- but with a sense of fun that will have parents smiling too. Taking their British accents way over the top Tim Curry as Elizas father Nigel Thornberry and Lynn Redgrave as Grandmumsy Cordelia Thornberry are clearly having a ball. This may be Currys best character since he was Dr. Frank-N-Furter in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" Viewers will also appreciate that not everyone is a goody-goody. Elizas self-absorbed teen-queen sister Debbie suggests that people might want to ""talk to me and pretend I am listening."" Also Darwin turns out to be a complete wuss. Told that he and Eliza are going off to boarding school the chimps greatest concern is that the ""gym shorts show off my problem area."" Also worth noting is an all-star musical lineup including Paul Simon (with a nice original song) Peter Gabriel P. Diddy and Brandy. It all adds up to a cheekier ""Lion King"" on a lower budget. But what you miss in spectacle you will make up in laughs. -- C.W. Nevius ON GUARD Swashbuckler/romance. Starring Daniel Auteuil and Vincent Perez. Directed by Philippe de Broca. (Not rated. 128 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) . ""On Guard"" which shouldnt be judged by its silly title is a big gorgeous sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand uncomplicated fashion. The photography and costumes are sumptuous Daniel Auteuil is tremendously entertaining in the lead role and the whole enterprise has the buoyancy humor and eagerness to please of an Errol Flynn adventure yarn. Sure its high-flung hokum -- a storybook romance painted in broad vivid strokes on a wide historical canvas -- but veteran director Philippe de Broca (""King of Hearts"") knows what hes doing and precisely how to pitch his saga of revenge swordplay love and chicanery. Based on a popular 1857 novel ""Le Bossu"" (The Hunchback) ""On Guard"" opens in the early 18th century when a flamboyant duke (Vincent Perez) takes Lagardere (Daniel Auteuil) a gifted swordsman of humble birth under his wing. When the duke is stabbed in the back by his vicious cousin Gonzague (Fabrice Luchini) he asks Lagardere in his last dying words to raise his infant daughter Aurore. Sixteen years pass Lagardere is living with a group of traveling actors and Aurore has grown into a magnificent beauty (Marie Gillain). Making good on his vow he masquerades as a hunchback penetrates the royal court where Gonzague is holding Aurores mother prisoner and avenges his patrons death. ""On Guard"" rounds out its two-hour length with a predictable but utterly satisfying episode of virtue stomping out craven ambition. Theres a slightly creepy aspect to Lagarderes growing passion for Aurore -- shades of Woody Allen and Soon-Yi -- but Auteuil is an actor of apparently unlimited resources and energy and he makes ""On Guard"" a large unexpected pleasure. . This film contains mild nudity and violence. -- Edward Guthmann Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 7 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...
