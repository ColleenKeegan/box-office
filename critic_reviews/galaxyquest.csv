Getting a life is the punchline of Galaxy Quest a fast loose and very funny parody that pulls off the not-so-simple feat of tweaking Trekkies and honoring them ribbing long-in-the-tooth actors and applauding them bringing together Star Trek savants and those who couldnt give a squat about dilithium crystals and saying See theres room on the final frontier for everyone. Just the sight of a Shatneresque Tim Allen a Nimoyish Alan Rickman (with a touch of Patrick Stewarts British grandiosity) and a generically blond and full-bosomed Sigourney Weaver as cast members of a late-70s Trek clone called Galaxy Quest making their wretched middle-aged livings signing autographs is treat enough. But the movie takes a giddy leap when the hungover faux spaceship commander is visited by aliens who look like overenthusiastic fans but who turn out to be...Thermians from the Klatu Nebula who have studied old episodes of the TV series as ""historical documents"" and who desperately need the ""crews"" help. Director Dean Parisot (Home Fries) working from a sharp script by newcomer David Howard and Robert Gordon (Addicted to Love) understands the Trek ethos. When the picture jostles as the spacecraft is bombarded and when life-forms that look cuddly as babies turn out to be stone-cold savages you know that Parisot knows that you know that Star Trek long canceled will continue to provide comic inspiration to infinity and beyond.

Galaxy Quest opening tomorrow spins out of a single joke about a bunch of washed-up actors from a canceled television series who are enlisted by some credulous interplanetary simpletons to champion them in conflict with a scaly bellicose villain who has all but exterminated their people. If Galaxy Quest never attains consistently giddy heights as it plays out its combination of knowing satire and heroic adventure it nevertheless keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek offers a few genuine laughs moves swiftly if not at warp speed and is led by a talented cast. The crew includes Tim Allen as the egotistical Jason Nesmith. To his legions of fans he is Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggart of the immortal line Never give up; never surrender. Sigourney Weaver no stranger to combat with slimy space aliens plays Gwen DeMarco known to her fans as Lt. Tawny Madison the voluptuous communications officer aboard Taggarts ship Protector. And Alan Rickman is Alexander Dane who sadly remembers that he once portrayed Richard III in the days before he signed on to become the Spock-like humanoid Dr. Lazarus. These actors and Tony Shalhoub as Fred Kwan alias Tech Sergeant Chen and Daryl Mitchell as Tommy Webber the navigator Lieutenant Laredo have been reduced to signing autographs at fan shows for 15 a pop and snipping ribbons at supermarket openings when fate (directed by Dean Parisot from a script by David Howard and Robert Gordon) intervenes. In a scene that skewers the ubiquitous Star Trek fan conventions as the testy disheartened crew copes with costumed cultists minutiae-obsessed teenagers and giggling groupies Nesmith-Taggart is approached by a group of odd creatures he assumes are fans. He dismisses their monotonous babble. The next day after he wakes up on the floor at home hung over after a night of solitary drinking they whisk him off to what he thinks is another re-enactment a negotiation as Taggart with the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs) on behalf of the gentle Thermians. But when Nesmith-Taggart is miraculously returned he realizes that he has been aboard a genuine spaceship. It seems that the Thermians led by Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni) believe the courage- and principle-filled Galaxy Quest television episodes they have witnessed to be actual historical documents and have sought out Taggart to lead them. Alexander Taggart tells the once and future Dr. Lazarus after he rises to the challenge and enlists his old crew this is the role of a lifetime. So off they go joined -- in one of the films best comic conceptions -- by Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell) now a convention organizer but once an obscure bit player who died a quick death in episode 81. Throughout the adventure as the heroes do battle with Sarris and his minions encounter cannibalistic space creatures who resemble children face off against assorted monsters and other perils while standing between the Thermians and extinction Fleegman remains convinced that being an unknown actor he is fated by the laws of scriptwriting to perish once more. In the parched comic landscape that now stretches over much of planet Earth Galaxy Quest may not be a monument to the genre but it offers a ray of hope for the future. Galaxy Quest is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes a mildly crude word a standard issue of space monsters and associated violence. GALAXY QUEST Directed by Dean Parisot; written by David Howard and Robert Gordon based on a story by Mr. Howard; director of photography Jerzy Zielinski; edited by Don Zimmerman; music by David Newman; production designer Linda DeScenna; produced by Mark Johnson and Charles Newirth; released by DreamWorks Pictures. Running time 102 minutes. This film is rated PG. WITH Tim Allen (Jason Nesmith) Sigourney Weaver (Gwen DeMarco) Alan Rickman (Alexander Dane) Tony Shalhoub (Fred Kwan) Sam Rockwell (Guy Fleegman) Daryl Mitchell (Tommy Webber) Robin Sachs (Sarris) and Enrico Colantoni (Mathesar).

"Galaxy Quest | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; galaxy-quest ) Galaxy Quest (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli Back in the years when Star Trek was still a cult phenomenon (instead of a mainstream cash cow for Paramount Pictures) fan fiction was about the only way Trekkies could experience the latest exploits of their favorite characters. One of the more inventive examples of such writing was called ""Visit to a Weird Planet Revisited"" (by Ruth Berman). The premise underlying this story is that a transporter malfunction causes three Star Trek characters (from an alternate universe) to switch places with the actors playing them. Consequently William Shatner finds himself in command of a very real starship out in space that is under attack by the nefarious Klingons. This same central conceit forms the basis of the movie Galaxy Quest except that the TV show in question is only Star Trek in spirit not in fact. Since its cancellation in 1982 Galaxy Quest has developed a loyal and fanatical following. However none of the actors who appeared in the series have gone on to greater glory. Instead they continue to earn a living by taking bit parts and appearing in costume at Galaxy Quest conventions. Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart seems to enjoy being associated with his character but his opinion is not shared by his fellow cast members. Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver) Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) regard their lot in life with resignation but Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman) who played the alien Dr. Lazarus is resentful. Then during one Galaxy Quest convention Nesmith is approached by a group of fans dressed up (or so he thinks) as aliens. Their leader Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni) explains that his people the Thermians need Commander Taggarts help. In short order thinking theyre going to some sort of low-level acting gig Nesmith and his fellow actors find themselves transported to a space ship where they are expected to dispatch an intergalactic tyrant. It seems that the Thermians have picked up the Galaxy Quest TV show broadcasts and have mistaken the program for a series of ""historical documents."" So believing Nesmith to be Taggart they expect him to save the day. In terms of parodying all things Star Trek Galaxy Quest is often inventive hitting both obvious and not-so-obvious targets. Fandom receives the sharpest edge of director Dean Parisots satirical blade although he and his screenwriters (Robert Gordon and David Howard) are never overtly vicious or cruel in their thrusts (at least no more than William Shatner was in his famous Saturday Night Live appearance). More than one attendee at the Galaxy Quest convention has a hard time differentiating reality from fantasy and almost everyone there quotes dialogue from episodes with the kind of reverence that deeply religious people reserve for scriptural text. What we see of the Galaxy Quest TV show looks an awful lot like Star Trek - right down to the indoor planet sets with styrofoam rocks. Taggart is a Kirk clone and theres more than a passing likeness between Dr. Lazarus and Spock. The tempestuous relationships among the Galaxy Quest actors also recall those of the Trek cast members. Nesmiths colossal ego is undoubtedly supposed to echo the personality trait for which Shatner became best known after the original program went off the air. From time-to-time Galaxy Quest does something exceptionally clever. A case in point is the scene where the USS Enterprise - er make that the NSEA Protector - is leaving spacedock. This is something we have seen in more than one of the Star Trek movies with the ship gliding smoothly from its moorings as majestic music plays in the background. Unfortunately in Galaxy Quest the navigator doesnt quite know what hes doing and the Protector fails to get out of the garage unscathed. For those few potential viewers who are completely ignorant of Star Trek the movie still offers a mildly enjoyable (although completely predictable) storyline of normal people who become heroes. In addition theres the fish out of water aspect of actors having to fly a space ship. In many ways Galaxy Quest is more fantasy than science fiction. Its a lighthearted romp. If you buy into the infectious (but admittedly corny) spirit youll enjoy the experience. Those expecting a heavy dose of action and adventure or some genuine substance will be disappointed. Galaxy Quest isnt always funny but for the most part it is fun. And in terms of production values the film looks a lot better than one might expect from a space comedy. Most of the special effects are first-rate. The actors do solid jobs. Tim Allen who is almost certainly on hand to broaden the films appeal doesnt attempt to mimic Shatner or Kirk but there are times when certain mannerisms make it apparent that he has seen a few Star Trek episodes. Sigourney Weaver trying to get as far away from Ripley as possible goes through the film as a blonde who displays ample cleavage (she credits the costume designers with ""supporting"" her in this area). Alan Rickman is suitably dour and Tony Shalhoub has his moments. Meanwhile Sam Rockwell is on hand as someone who had a walk-on part being killed off in a Galaxy Quest episode and is now afraid the same thing is going to happen in real life. Galaxy Quest has a good time playing with different aspects of science fiction in general and Star Trek in particular. And although it isnt necessary to come armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of the original Star Trek TV series to enjoy this movie the better you know Galaxy Quests inspiration the more you will get out of this picture.

Starring Tim Allen Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman. Directed by Dean Parisot. (PG. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Everybody gets another Christmas gift this morning and thats ""Galaxy Quest"" a new space comedy that arrives in theaters today. The premise is irresistible. The cast of a ""Star Trek""-like TV show is brought to outer space by aliens who have been watching reruns of the program for years. Since these aliens have no concept of deceit in any form -- not even in the form of acting -- they believe that they are watching historical transmissions. Now they are hoping that the cast of ""Galaxy Quest"" will lead them to victory in a space war. This picture is an example of what is called ""high-concept"" filmmaking. The setup alone is enough to make people curious to see it. Unfortunately most high-concept films have only the concept. They are ideas that go nowhere. Not ""Galaxy Quest."" This movie is more than one joke or one idea. Its a thoroughly satisfying comedy -- and a respectable space adventure as well. It has been 17 years since the ""Galaxy Quest"" TV series was canceled and the actors careers have been reduced to appearances at annual conventions. Jason who played Captain Taggart on the series is played by Tim Allen. Allens movements are dancelike and he exudes William Shatners impervious optimism and radiant self-satisfaction though the portrayal could not quite be called a Shatner imitation. ONCE A SHAKESPEAREAN Taggarts first officer was played by Alexander Dane who is in turn played by Alan Rickman who gives us a dryly comic picture of an actor in hell. He hates his life; he hates his career; and he remembers with bitter regret that he once starred in ""Richard III"" before fate landed him on a prime-time series wearing ears that look like fins. He is mortified when he has to stand onstage at conventions and say his signature line ""By Gramthas hammer I shall be avenged"" As on ""Star Trek"" all the characters in ""Galaxy Quest"" -- in the movie and also on the fictitious show -- are made vivid and individual if only in superficial ways. Sigourney Weaver is Gwen DeMarco known as communications officer Lt. Tawny Madison. On the show she wears low-cut uniforms and repeats back to the captain what the computer tells her. She winds up doing the same in a real-life space adventure. The actors follow the aliens onto their spaceship thinking they are taking an acting gig. Next thing they know they are in a fierce war and the only way to go home is by winning. Fortunately they know their way around the equipment. The friendly aliens who have built their entire civilization around ""Galaxy Quest"" have created a spaceship whose controls are identical to those on the TV show. ENGINEER IN CONTROL Tony Shalhoub usually a dour screen presence is very funny as the space mechanic the temperamental opposite of ""Star Treks"" Scotty. He reports the most horrific damage to the ship with an impossibly relaxed demeanor. Sam Rockwell gets a comic workout as Guy Fleegman a convention organizer who appeared on one episode of the original series and was killed off in five minutes. He goes through the movie in a state of panic that life is about to imitate art. Also worthy of note is Enrico Colantoni who plays the alien leader as a creature of such benignity that his naivete is not only amusing but also rather touching. ""Galaxy Quest"" has many comic elements but its the adventure story that brings them together. After all to successfully parody ""Star Trek"" for almost two hours one must ground the parody in a respectable ""Star Trek"" episode. Thats precisely what ""Galaxy Quest"" does.

More ingratiating than uproarious ""Galaxy Quest"" nonetheless emerges as one of the holiday movie seasons more pleasant surprises. A mischievously clever and slickly commercial sci-fi comedy with strong cross-generational appeal pic gets impressive mileage from a one-joke premise -- stars of a ""Star Trek""-type TV series are drafted into battling real extraterrestrial villains -- thanks in large measure to game efforts from a first-rate cast. Look for good-to-superior B.O. numbers followed by stellar homevid biz. Scripters David Howard and Robert Gordon persuasively limn a parallel universe where a cheesy primetime space opera called ""Galaxy Quest"" continues to inspire a cult following almost 20 years after its cancellation. Die-hard fans known as Questerians flock to conventions where stars of the beloved series sign autographs -- for a price -- while enduring scads of questions about ridiculously arcane trivia. Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) the ""Quest"" equivalent of William Shatner is an overbearing and unreliable egotist who clearly enjoys the adulation he receives at the conventions. And with good reason Since his heyday as Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggart a heroic National Space Exploration Agency officer in charge of the starship Protector Nesmiths career has been in almost total eclipse. Its only at the conventions -- and better still during solo promotional appearances unknown to other ""Galaxy Quest"" alumni -- that Nesmith gets a chance to jump-start his faded stardom. But the conventions are painfully mixed blessings for Nesmiths overshadowed co-stars who havent done much since the series either Gwen DeMarco (a becomingly blond Sigourney Weaver) who did little more than serve as a bosomy babe on the TV series; Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman) a cynical Shakespearean actor who permanently typecast himself by playing the half-human half-reptilian Dr. Lazarus; Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) a conspicuously non-Asian fellow who nevertheless played Tech Sgt. Chen; and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) who was a child actor back when he played the 10-year-old navigator of the Protector. Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell) a frequent convention host has an even more dubious claim to fame In an early ""Galaxy Quest"" episode he played a semi-anonymous crewman who was killed before the first commercial. After an amusing prologue at a typical ""Galaxy Quest"" convention the real fun begins when Nesmith is approached by a group of what he assumes to be odder-than-usual fans. The worshipful strangers -- who move stiffly smile sweetly and sound more than a little like Coneheads -- turn out to be extraterrestrials in human guise. Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni) is leader of the Thermians naive creatures who assume the TV programs theyve picked up from Earth are documentaries not dramas. They believe that ""those poor people"" on ""Gilligans Island"" really were shipwrecked. And more important they believe Cmdr. Taggart and his crew are true-blue heroes who can help the Thermians defend themselves against the intergalactic marauders led by the dreaded Sarris (Robin Sachs). Even though the Thermians have built a fully functioning version of the Protector meticulously copied from the TV series Nesmith and his co-stars (including Fleegman) are singularly ill-prepared for offscreen heroics. And Sarris and his warriors are far less credulous -- and much more media-savvy -- than the innocent Thermians. You dont have to be an ardent Trekkie to fully appreciate ""Galaxy Quest."" But your enjoyment of the comedy will increase in direct proportion to your familiarity with the cliches and conventions that the screenwriters affectionately spoof. In addition to the running gags about the high mortality rate among bit players cast as unnamed crew members there are cheeky jokes about pinch-penny set designs absurdly booby-trapped tunnels and air ducts and distant planets where human visitors conveniently find all the oxygen they need to breathe. Attention is also paid to the notoriously active libidos of starship commanders. Under the fleet and playful direction of Dean Parisot (""Home Fries"") the well-cast actors are exceptionally deft at playing thesps who arent always quite so comfortable in their roles. Allen might have been even funnier if Nesmith were written -- and played -- with more of an edge. Still Allens quite good at charting the characters predictable evolution from self-absorbed ham to empathetic hero. No stranger to outer space after her ""Alien"" misadventures Weaver makes the most of an all-too-rare opportunity to demonstrate her talents for graceful pratfalls and spirited self-mockery. (In the grand wink-wink nudge-nudge tradition of coed space adventures ""Galaxy Quest"" contrives for Weaver to flash increasingly generous swaths of cleavage as the plot progresses.) Rickman smoothly underplays while delivering Danes snooty and acerbic wisecracks while Rockwell Shalhoub and Mitchell earn laughs as their characters acknowledge (and work against) the limitations of the TV series roles. In sharp contrast to what we see of the cult-fave TV series ""Galaxy Quest"" is decked out with all the flashy production values and f/x wizardry you would expect in an age when ""Star Wars"" not ""Star Trek"" sets the standard. Some of the trickery has a welcome touch of spoofery. The Sarris character looks like a cross between the Borg of ""Star Trek"" and the evil grasshopper of ""A Bugs Life."" And when he tries to drive the Protector out of its intergalactic parking space Mitchells Tommy Webber demonstrates just how hard it is to maneuver something that big without causing a little friction. While trying to maintain a brisk pace during the slam-bang climax Parisot occasionally sacrifices transitional detail for warp speed. On the plus side ""Galaxy Quest"" remains light and bright as it races along and never turns nasty or mean-spirited as it satirizes the cliches and cults of ""Star Trek.""

Getting a life is the punchline of Galaxy Quest a fast loose and very funny parody that pulls off the not-so-simple feat of tweaking Trekkies and honoring them ribbing long-in-the-tooth actors and applauding them bringing together Star Trek savants and those who couldnt give a squat about dilithium crystals and saying See theres room on the final frontier for everyone. Just the sight of a Shatneresque Tim Allen a Nimoyish Alan Rickman (with a touch of Patrick Stewarts British grandiosity) and a generically blond and full-bosomed Sigourney Weaver as cast members of a late-70s Trek clone called Galaxy Quest making their wretched middle-aged livings signing autographs is treat enough. But the movie takes a giddy leap when the hungover faux spaceship commander is visited by aliens who look like overenthusiastic fans but who turn out to be...Thermians from the Klatu Nebula who have studied old episodes of the TV series as ""historical documents"" and who desperately need the ""crews"" help. Director Dean Parisot (Home Fries) working from a sharp script by newcomer David Howard and Robert Gordon (Addicted to Love) understands the Trek ethos. When the picture jostles as the spacecraft is bombarded and when life-forms that look cuddly as babies turn out to be stone-cold savages you know that Parisot knows that you know that Star Trek long canceled will continue to provide comic inspiration to infinity and beyond.
