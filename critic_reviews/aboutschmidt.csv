Photo Claudette Barius/New Line Productions HANDOUT PHOTO Photo HANDOUT About Schmidt digs for the truth 1 / 1 Back to Gallery About Schmidt Comedy-drama. Starring Jack Nicholson Hope Davis and Kathy Bates. Directed by Alexander Payne. (VHS and DVD. R. 120 minutes.) ""About Schmidt"" is the movie that dares to say its all a lie that the truisms that movies and mass culture live by are reassuring myths but lead nowhere. Here old age is a time of confusion not insight. Love doesnt grow but grows stale evolving into vague contempt. A child is no comfort and taking off down the road -- the great American standby -- offers nothing in the way of self-discovery. Its all empty. In ""About Schmidt"" co-written and directed by Alexander Payne (""Election"") the laughs are few and mostly bitter. At heart this is a serious movie and its not necessary to endorse its viewpoint to recognize that its also a seriously good movie a challenge to viewers a rebuke of the way many Americans live. Jack Nicholson stars as Warren Schmidt a healthy but exhausted 66-year-old retiring from his job as an insurance executive. At his retirement dinner  a friend tells Warren that if a man works hard and provides for his family he can look back on his life with satisfaction. Thats the very premise that the film doubts -- and Schmidt doubts it too. Heres an actor whose smile has always suggested a fellow one step ahead of the crowd and here he just looks stumped and overstuffed. Nicholson lends Schmidt hope as though he expects life to finally start and quiet anger as if knowing it wont and that it just might end. In a series of letters to a foster child in Africa Schmidt narrates a free- form story which takes him through the Midwest in a Winnebago in the days leading up to his daughters wedding. Payne a Midwesterner himself understands the manners of the region the strained friendliness the excessive bonhomie and laughter that can be used to deflect contact as much as invite it. Kathy Bates as the randy ex-hippie mother of Schmidts future son-in-law provides some comedy giving Schmidt another wacko to endure but the more enduring scenes are the quieter ones -- as when Schmidt watches his daughter (Hope Davis) get married. Nicholson quietly conveys that its not just the specifics of the wedding that sadden Schmidt (the groom is a goofball) but the phenomenon itself the ephemerality of life the near inevitability of disappointment. Payne and his co-writer Jim Taylor have little hope or wisdom to offer and their occasionally condescending way with characters may put off some viewers. But the limits of their vision only help them making the movie all the more despairing and thus more effective. These filmmakers are not standing on the outside of their creation understanding all. Theyre in the midst of its confusion. ""About Schmidt"" is as spiritually lost as its character. . The film contains brief nudity.

This is not because Jack Nicholson who plays him to perfection is particularly weighty or out of shape for a 66-year-old man. What slows him is the rhythms of his region and his culture; he is a Midwesterner of the Wasp persuasion which means he is solid stolid and silent except when exchanging arms-length pleasantries with his friends. Like so many men of his class and place he has bent himself to a job (as an insurance company actuary) that is at once dull and intricate and to a city (Omaha Neb.) where the agreed-upon illusion is stability. Schmidt is probably in touch with certain things his football team his wifes tuna-noodle casserole and at this season of the year his snowblower. What he is not in touch with is his feelings -- in particular with his anger. He would deny its very existence or that of any other emotion that might upset the even tenor of his days. But speaking of denial I had forgotten that men like Warren Schmidt still exist even though they are my people. I was raised among them though I fled their phlegmish company decades ago to join the chattering classes. Once in a while I read something that evokes them -- Evan S. Connells lovely novels about Mr. and Mrs. Bridge Garrison Keillors sweet-savage Lake Wobegon comedies -- but an air of reminiscence touches those works. I guessed that television the Internet the jet planes that could whisk these characters to Europe overnight had long since thawed their taciturnity granted them full citizenship in the culture of complaint.

After all some of my old high school buddies still do pretty good Warren Schmidt imitations. So the first and most lasting surprise about Alexander Paynes About Schmidt is finding its protagonist unaltered by the passing years. The street he lives on still looks like the street where I grew up. His ability to turn potential drama into manageable banality remains unchanged. And yet Schmidt has what the rest of us have learned to call ""issues."" His wife with whom he has settled into a life of hostile boredom dies suddenly. She leaves him the house trailer in which they planned to embrace a footloose life and evidence that she once had an affair with his best friend. His ill-favored but blindly loved daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) is about to marry a slippery water-bed salesman (Dermot Mulroney) and be absorbed into his awful family. They are ruled over by a mom (Kathy Bates) who is an overbearing monster of cordiality and are lost in a time warp more preposterous than Schmidts they still live like 60s hippies. Off Schmidt goes in his trailer to rescue Jeannie. After a lifetime of self-effacement a lifetime in which his every clumsy word has driven Jeannie into deeper resentment we wonder if finally he will find the gumption to break the habit of polite dissimulation. What gives us hope is a character we never see. His name is Ndugo. Hes a 6-year-old Tanzanian boy whom Warren sponsors with a 22-a-month contribution to Childreach. The charity encourages donors to write their ""adoptees"" and to this child Schmidt pours out all the suppressed secrets of his heart. We begin to think Well maybe. Perhaps we is the wrong pronoun. Maybe you would be more appropriate. Because not for a moment did I think Nicholson or Payne -- an Omaha native -- would betray Schmidts essence. The director who co-wrote the screenplay with Jim Taylor understands that lives like Schmidts are composed of incidents that cannot must not be forced into confrontation. Payne also understands what it has taken me most of a lifetime to comprehend that the Schmidts of this world are not to be easily dismissed. Payne did that brilliantly in Election a few years back. Here hes after something deeper. And maybe if places like Omaha are not bred in your bones you will grow impatient with the patience he expends on Schmidt his refusal to satirize him and his dim inconsequence. But not me. The contempt I once felt for Schmidt and his ilk the men who shaped me and my emotional refusals was at least temporarily dissolved by this sublime and sorrowful movie replaced by something that feels a little bit like compassion and a little bit like -- dare I say it?--love.

Flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others 65-year-old Jack Nicholson could be looking at his 12th Oscar nomination by proving that hes now more than ever choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary. Movie review About Schmidt ( out of four) Stars Jack Nicholson Hope Davis Dermot Mulroney Kathy Bates Director Alexander Payne Distributor New Line Rating R for some language and brief nudity Opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles He even plays an actuary (subcategory put out to pasture) in director Alexander Paynes deliberately slow-paced but insightfully moving portrait of a lifes third act. Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor who also did Citizen Ruth and Election now own the patent on portraying the Midwests emotional underbelly even though the bulk of this movies gently satirical skewering takes place in Denver. Nicholsons Warren Schmidt isnt crazy about his 42-year marriage nor his recent retirement in Omaha in favor of a doofus successor. He doesnt hate it quite enough to effect one of those patented Nicholson screen rages but then his wife suddenly keels over while vacuuming their home into its standard smothering state. After a brief period of going to seed he climbs into his motor home and takes to the road with a mission. Through a successfully employed screen device -- an incongruously funny voice-over of letters he has written to an African foster child -- we learn about everything bugging him. His chief goal is to sink though not recklessly the pending marriage of his daughter (Hope Davis) to a low-class waterbed salesman (Dermot Mulroney). When Nicholson is put up in his future son-in-laws old bedroom the set design immediately shows us why this guy is such a loser. And thanks to sharp writing plus a marvelous performance by Kathy Bates as Mulroneys mom (last week she won the 2002 supporting actress award from the National Board of Review) we easily sense why this flaky woman went through two husbands -- and why shes on the prowl for a third. (Guess who?) Nicholson has at least three magnificent moments in Hour 2. The best is a wedding toast that comes after another that will painfully remind you of every banal wedding toast youve ever heard. The actors restraint is superbly on the mark though after 2001s equally subdued Pledge it makes you wonder whether Jack will ever be a wild man again. Happily the funny coming attraction for Aprils Anger Management -- with Nicholson and Adam Sandler -- tells us we dont need to worry about that.

Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.com Movie reviews (CNN) -- ""About Schmidt"" a dark comedy from the brilliant mind of Alexander Payne will undoubtedly earn Jack Nicholson his 12th Academy Award nomination which will add to his current record as the most nominated actor ever. It may be a year for oft-nominated actors Meryl Streep is likely to earn a 13th nomination for either ""The Hours"" or ""Adaptation."" Nicholsons nomination will be well deserved he is pure perfection as Warren Schmidt a card-carrying ""everyman"" who has played by the rules his whole life only to have the game changed in the final innings. Schmidt is an average guy who has lived an average life in an average house married for 42 years to an average woman (June Squibb) and together theyve had an average daughter whom Schmidt has essentially taken for granted her whole life. Suddenly his bland tidy predictable existence is blown apart. In quick succession hes forced -- at the age of 66 -- to retire from his decades-long job as an actuary for an insurance company in Omaha Nebraska; his wife drops dead; and his daughter Jeannie becomes engaged to underachieving loser named Randall (Dermot Mulroney from 1997s ""My Best Friends Wedding"") who makes his living as a waterbed salesman. Making connections Nicholson tries to break up the engagement of his daughter (Hope Davis) and her fiance (Dermot Mulroney). Schmidts life becomes a train wreck as he realizes everything in his world that had any shred of meaning is now gone. They only human connection he has left is Jeannie (Hope Davis of 1998s ""Next Stop Wonderland"") who now lives in Denver and over the years that connection has become based more on habit than on love. He needs something to live for and decides that his new mission in life is to prevent his daughter from marrying Randall. He sets out in a 35-foot motor home in which he had planned to travel the country with his late wife. His journey to Denver becomes a quest of self-discovery exploring his roots across Nebraska. The results of that tour are disappointing to say the least. And when he finally reaches his destination he gets a whole lot more than he bargained for. Jeannie is less then receptive to his new-found interest in her life and Randalls parents are so far out in left field they make Randall look like a choirboy. Expressing himself Nicholson plays a recently retired insurance executive in ""About Schmidt."" In a performance to rival Nicholsons Kathy Bates plays Roberta Hertzel Randalls free-wheeling free-spirited earth mama with a passion for hot tubs nudity and sex. Howard Hesseman plays her ex-husband and Randalls father but its Bates who steals the show. Schmidt is utterly horrified by Roberta. When she strips (yes Bates has a nude scene) to join Schmidt in the hot tub Nicholsons reaction is worth the price of admission. After his wifes death -- in an odd but completely charming touch -- Schmidt begins sponsoring a six-year-old Tanzanian orphan for 22 a month and begins corresponding with the child. His name is Ndugu Umbo and Schmidts long letters to the boy are filled with the things hes left unsaid all his life. This outpouring of emotion from the older man to the small stranger is a thread throughout the film and allows the viewer glimpses of Schmidts inner turmoil. Payne along with his writing partner Jim Taylor is one of the brightest lights and greatest talents working in film today. From ""Citizen Ruth"" (1996) which took a cock-eyed look at both sides of the abortion issue to ""Election"" (1999) which put Reese Witherspoon on Hollywoods radar he has consistently provided a uniquely adult and refreshingly intellectual voice to the art of filmmaking. He and Taylor explore the human condition with the keen eyes of social satirists. They excel at making the most uncomfortable situations deeply poignant and exceedingly human. ""About Schmidt"" is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year. If youre not deeply touched by this movie check your pulse. ""About Schmidt"" opens in New York and Los Angeles on December 13 expands to the top 20 markets on December 20 and then opens nationwide on January 3 2003.

"About Schmidt | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; about-schmidt ) About Schmidt (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli When youre young you live your life looking forward. The future looms larger and more full of promise than the past and everyone not afflicted with incurable pessimism believes that the best is yet to come. But all things age and die and wither away and there comes a time when every human being must pause and take stock of his or her mortality. It can be a hard thing to acknowledge that the expanse of the past is wider and more fertile than the ever-shrinking distance to the futures horizon yet this is a reality that no one can escape. Until recently Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) was like so many millions of American workers leading a life bounded by conformity and routine. Now at age 66 he has been forced to leave behind his assistant vice president job at a Nebraska-based insurance company and amble into the great unknown of retirement. Suddenly life seems to be closing in on Warren. Helen (June Squibb) his wife of 42 years is getting on his nerves he despises the man (Dermot Mulroney) about to marry his beloved daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) and most importantly when he looks back at his six-plus decades of life he cant see any way that he has made a difference. So after watching a television infomercial he writes out a check to a ""Save the Children"" organization and ""adopts"" a six-year old Tanzanian boy named Ndugu. Then unexpectedly Helen dies and Warren finds himself alone. So he packs his bags climbs into the spacious RV sitting in his driveway and heads off to visit his daughter a after making a few stops along the way. About Schmidt is an unsentimental yet effective portrait of a character struggling with the essential questions of life. Although it has moments of cynicism this is not a cynical film. Although it contains instances of humor it is not a comedy. And although it contains elements of the road trip genre it is not a road trip movie. Instead this is an opportunity to spend two hours in the company of a fairly ordinary man who no longer understands the point of anything. About Schmidt is at its best when the satirical and comedic elements are low-key and unforced. With the darkly funny Election director Alexander Payne displayed a deft hand when combining serious issues with humor. He is not as successful here. At times such as when Warren finds himself unwillingly sharing a hot tub with a naked woman (played with gusto by an uninhibited Kathy Bates) the laughs seem awkward and out-of-place. This results in an uneven uncertain tone. One thing that is rock-solid throughout is the performance of Jack Nicholson. Nicholson carries the movie and does so by not just being Jack but by using an understated approach to playing Warren. This isnt a flamboyant over-the-top individual but a sad quiet man who looks at the world though lenses tinted with despair. This is one of Nicholsons best acting assignments in years and the smart money has him at least being nominated for a Best Actor Oscar next year. About Schmidt is on the long side. Some of the road trip detours drag a little and there are perhaps a few too many ""colorful"" characters. (For example the vignette with Warrens exuberant temporary RV neighbors comes across as little more than an opportunity to tack about 10 minutes onto the running length.) The catharsis at the end hits the right note giving the viewer a sense of closure without betraying the character or cheapening what has gone before. On balance I recommend the movie both for Nicholsons performance and for the opportunity to spend some time with the kind of man that we often meet in real life but rarely see on screen.

Now hes driving a Winnebago hes alone and nothing comes easy. Paunchy with varicose veins in his ankles and a bad comb-over Warren Schmidt is a just-retired just-widowed Omaha insurance actuary facing mortality in an empty home. ""About Schmidt"" I should add is a comedy. But its laughs--and there are many--arise from loss and pain and you may leave in tears.In need of a mission Schmidt sets off to Denver hoping to persuade his only daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) to back out of her imminent wedding to water-bed salesman Randall Hertzel (Dermot Mulroney) an affable lunkhead with a mullet and an entirely unwarranted optimism about his prospects. With no one to talk to Schmidt takes to writing letters to his pen pal Ndugu a 6-year-old Tanzanian boy whom he sponsors for 22 a month. These voice-over letters often at odds with reality are a brilliant stroke allowing us to overhear Schmidt wrestling with his dawning awareness of the emptiness inside him.This is not the Nicholson youre used to. Its startling when you see him with his small gray-haired wife (Jane Squibb) at his retirement party because you never see Nicholson paired with a woman his own age. Audiences expecting the devilish ""Jack"" to burst out are in for a surprise. The sardonic wit is replaced by the stunned confusion of a man realizing that his life has added up to zilch. This powerfully contained painfully funny performance has to rank with the greatest work hes ever done. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week It takes a little time to find your way inside Paynes movie which is in no hurry to wow you. Payne and his writing partner Jim Taylor who gave us ""Citizen Ruth"" and the brilliant high-school satire ""Election"" are working in a quieter vein here--and a deeper one. Under its deceptively flat Nebraskan surface it has a delayed-release emotional charge as devastating as that of any American film this year.Payne and Taylor have great ears for the way Middle Americans talk for the smokescreens of cant and bonhomie that disguise real feelings. Though the film is nominally based on Louis Begleys novel (in which Schmidt is a Manhattan attorney) its been thoroughly reinvented. And its by no means a one-man show. Davis is pitch-perfect as Schmidts resentful daughter a tiny tightly wound bundle of rage. Mulroney is hilarious without lapsing into caricature as her cloddish fiance. ""About Schmidt"" reaches its comic peak when Schmidt arrives in Denver where Randall Hertzels divorced mother Roberta (Kathy Bates) a libidinous bohemian wants to lure the widower into her hot tub. (Shes the run-to-seed descendant of Nabokovs Charlotte Haze.) Roberta is the sort of woman who would describe herself as a ""free spirit"" but Bates in a piercing performance shows us the alcohol-fueled fury within.Paynes comedy can make you squirm because he cuts so close to the bone of middle-class family dysfunction. But the acid satire is balanced by a compassion that saves the movie from cruelty. In one unforgettable scene Schmidt comes on to a married woman (Connie Ray) in a trailer park. Shes seen into his soul and hes so moved and aroused that he misinterprets her interest as a sexual invitation. We laugh at her exaggerated cheeriness and her pop-psychology jargon. But all her perceptions about Schmidt are true and you can see why hes drawn to her. This scene is a perfect example of Paynes uncanny ability to wed hilarity humiliation and heartbreak in a single moment. This road movie gives you emotional whiplash and youll be glad you went along for the ride.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Barius) A About Schmidt Genre Drama; Starring Jack Nicholson Kathy Bates Hope Davis Dermot Mulroney June Squibb; Director Alexander Payne; Author Alexander Payne Jim Taylor; Release Date Limited 12/13/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 124; MPAA Rating R; Distributor New Line Cinema Posted December 13 2002 -- 1200 AM EST At a press conference following the premiere of About Schmidt at Cannes last May Jack Nicholson said that he rooted the character of Warren Schmidt a Nebraska insurance actuary in the mans comb-over - a serious stuck hairdo for a serious stuck man who endures our laughter and earns our empathy. Theres much more to Nicholsons Oscar-worthy performance than hairspray of course but the wily star is onto something The power of this great movie - part comedy part tragedy part satire mostly masterpiece - is in the details. You dont have to know Omaha to know that Omaha-bred filmmaker Alexander Payne has located what is right and true personal and universal about quiet American desperation and raucous American individuality. Even more than in his previous two beauts ""Election"" and ""Citizen Ruth"" Payne is in perfect vibration with the Om in Omaha. Not that 66-year-old Warren Schmidt would know Om from an omelette. He has paid out a lifetime of workdays calculating precisely when a man is likely to die but has never let himself feel the painful astonishment of what its like to live. Yet here he is recently retired with time on his hands. It may be too late for big changes in life - like his comb-over some things are set. But Schmidts odyssey he decides will be to drive his motor home to see his only child Jeannie (Hope Davis) in Denver where he will try to prevent her from marrying her boobish fiance Randall (Dermot Mulroney) a charmless waterbed salesman with an era-defying tonsorial style all his own. Much is being made of the lack of vanity with which Nicholson inhabits the part; the actors containment of his famous Jackness is striking in its discipline and the understatement pays off in a climax of lasting power. But the generosity and concentration the actor gives to the movie is by no means a solo act. Expertly navigating between sharp social satire and bracing compassion - those places where we can locate our own vulnerabilities in the eccentricities of others - Payne and his cowriter Jim Taylor have created a neighborhood of beautifully flawed characters. (The writers shaped the script from an earlier unproduced work by Payne combined with ideas from the Manhattan-based novel ""About Schmidt"" by Louis Begley.) And every role is a corker including that of Ndugu Umbo a never-seen 6-year-old Tanzanian orphan Schmidt sponsors for 22 a month and to whom he writes long letters smoothing grief rage and bewilderment at the puniness of his life into chirpy prose of stalwart Midwestern alrighty-ness. Davis evokes the resentful competence of a disappointed daughter making it easy to understand why shes attracted to the no-expectations messiness of Randall and his cheerfully boorish parents Roberta and Larry. We understand why those parents (Kathy Bates and Howard Hesseman) are divorced as well as why theyre still shouting at each other in intimate irritation. And by the time the incomparable Bates jumps beside Nicholson into her hot tub we realize that this brave and hilarious scene is destined to win awards for one of the best films of the year.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

New Line will have to emphasize the pics comic content and that this is one of Jack Nicholsons major performances. Films exist for different reasons and the indisputable raison detre for ""About Schmidt"" is to showcase Jack Nicholson giving a master class in the art of screen acting. A bit slack in its first half before erupting into some fine character-based hilarity in the latter-going Alexander Paynes look at an ordinary mans late-life crisis lacks the sharp satiric kick of his earlier efforts especially ""Election"" but is marked by knowing observations about the Midwestern middle class and a generally sagacious posture. Pic will be a tricky sell for New Line which will have to get out the word about the films comic content as well as to emphasize that this is one of Nicholsons major performances. Script by Payne and Jim Taylor which reps a synthesis of a script the former wrote years ago and an adaptation of Louis Begleys novel examines a man at the crossroads as he passes from a productive working life into potentially bleak retirement. Warren Schmidt (Nicholson) has worked as an actuary for a big insurance company in Omaha for his entire career and now at 66 is being put out to pasture. He has no particular plans other than to drive around in the enormous motor home hes bought at his wifes insistence. While hes not exactly bitter about his circumstances hes not really happy either; everything wife Helen (June Squibb) does and says bugs him and he disapproves of the man whom his only child Jeannie (Hope Davis) is about to marry. Opening reels are graced with insights into the traditional lifestyle in Omaha (Paynes hometown and the location of all of his films to date) and Schmidts moderate disenchantment is expressed in quiet ways that indicate his need to escape. These include his ducking out of his hale-and-hearty retirement party to have a drink alone at the bar secretly foster parenting an African orphan with whom he begins a correspondence and popping into a fast food joint just to slightly prolong his time away from Helen. Suddenly however Helen dies of a blood clot while cleaning the house. In a daze throughout the funeral period Schmidt badgers Jeannie who has come in from Denver with her fiance Randall (Dermot Mulroney) to stay a little longer and to consider postponing her wedding. But Jeannie resists all of her father entreaties leaving him of a mind ""to make the most of the time I have left."" His first move is to let the immaculate house go completely to seed. And when he finds some incriminating letters revealing a long-ago indiscretion between Helen and his best friend he clears her things out of the house and sets off in earnest to torpedo Jeannies wedding plans a visit she manages to postpone until the weekend of the event. Schmidt has felt all along that Randall who works a low-end job as a waterbed salesman and sports a Fu Manchu moustache and long ponytail that are hilariously declasse isnt good enough for his daughter that hes not ""up to snuff."" He finds out why when he arrives in Denver and meets the young mans family a motley crew whose antics send the picture into a major comic upswing. Giving Nicholson a run for his money here is Kathy Bates who is sensationally funny and on the money as an aging flower child and earth mother whos twice divorced and has no shortage of opinions on every topic. Her startlingly upfront nude scene in which she joins Schmidt in her Jacuzzi in attempt to nail husband No. 3 is something no audience would ever have expected to see and its funny as hell. Just as the film starts with the ceremonial event of Schmidts retirement dinner it dramatically concludes with Jeannies wedding and reception at which Schmidt is expected to give a speech. All along Nicholson has provided an open window into this man one like so many in that he had youthful ambitions to accomplish more than he actually did but who settled into a quietly productive conventional life dictated by the need to provide for a family. His marriage wasnt the greatest the nagging frustrations have presumably always been there but never bad enough for him to overhaul everything. Nicholson has plenty of opportunities to indicate his superiority to the character hes playing by indulging in his specialties of sarcastic line readings and squinty looks of disgust. But he resists them all very subtly suggesting Schmidts scorn and irritations but never losing his grip on the mans bedrock decency and solidity. When it comes time for the big speech Nicholson makes the mans temptation to say whats really on his mind vividly palpable his acute desire to tell the assembled crowd what mutts and bozos and under-achievers they are almost but not quite overtaking his instincts as a gentleman and a human being. Nicholsons solo verbal dance during this sequence is remarkable as his naked emotionalism just before fadeout. Davis has to work with the liability of her characters unvarying disagreeable resistance to her father as her prime attribute while Mulroney is gamely willing to be the butt of considerable disparaging humor. The pic has a plain look much of this deriving from the overwhelmingly grayish landscapes and pointedly mundane interior settings. Visual strategies are straightforward although there is one stunning shot in which Jeannie emerges from an out-of-focus mass of passengers disembarking from a plane to greet her father after her mothers death.
