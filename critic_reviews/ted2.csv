Entertainment ""Ted 2"" Is Too Lazy To Be Offensive Being awful is still no substitute for being funny -- but Seth MacFarlanes talking teddy bear sequel does manage some laughs anyway. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Mark Wahlberg and Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) in Ted 2. Universal Pictures ID 6084589 Seth MacFarlane is the king of frat boy comedy a spray-tanned bro turned Hollywood mogul who makes fun of everyone yet always seems to be most fiercely defended by young white men who want to know why everyone else wont just loosen up a little man its FUNNY. MacFarlane has built an empire off of a particular type of humor -- scattershot and rapid-fire rife with random cutaways pop culture references and an overwhelming certainty that being shocking is the same thing as making a joke. Its an approach that made him a billionaire with his multiple animated series an awkward leading man in A Million Ways to Die in the West and in 2013 a miscast Oscar host -- though admittedly hes got some august company there.Basically it doesnt matter if you cant stand Seth MacFarlane because Seth MacFarlane doesnt need you to. He has his fandom. Its dedicated. Its big. He has accomplished the seemingly impossible feat of becoming a celebrity animator. He has dated Daenerys Targaryen. He has recorded and released two albums of big band music. Even if you do not like Family Guy as I do not you have probably seen at least a dozen episodes as I have because it is essentially unavoidable courtesy of syndication and its continuing run on Fox. So when it comes around to Ted 2 -- which like its 2012 predecessor is about the adventures of a Boston man named John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) and his foul-mouthed living teddy bear Ted (voiced by MacFarlane whos also the directer and co-writer) -- it feels exhausting to even begin digging into its morass of would-be offensive jokes about race gender or homosexuality.Ted 2s sporadic need to provoke is the worst aspect of a movie that is against all odds sweet-centered and sometimes very funny. That compulsion is reminiscent of a child who once made a group of grown-ups laugh by running around pantless and so kept it up growing into an adult who whips his junk out all the time at parties in hopes its still hilarious. On that note consider this tale of two penis jokes. One involves genitalia-free Teds attempt to have a baby with his bride Tami-Lynn McCafferty (Jessica Barth) by sneaking into a sleeping Tom Bradys room to steal his sperm with the help of John who actually has performance anxiety about giving his football hero an adequate unwilling handjob. When the two lift the blankets a Pulp Fiction suitcase-style glow emanates out from his apparently magnificent johnson. View this image > Ted Wahlberg and Tom Brady in Ted 2. Universal Pictures ID 6084608 Its a laugh Theres buildup and theres a payoff. Which you cant say about the movies ongoing gag about how every search on the internet leads to ""black cocks"" a weird instance of empty goading that goes nowhere and is one of multiple examples of the movie leaning on race or sexuality for some hoped-for jolt. Theyre not mean-spirited jokes so much as breathtakingly lazy and half-written -- like the bit about Guy (Patrick Warburton) and his boyfriend Rick (Michael Dorn) attending New York Comic Con in costume (take a guess) in order to beat up attendees. Its not really a joke about geeks and its not really a joke about confounding expectations of gay men -- its just incoherent and sour.The trouble with Ted 2s ""no one is spared"" broadsides beyond the fact that its the kind of approach only Don Rickles has ever pulled off is that the only characters MacFarlane actually feels for are John and Ted. Theyre idiot stoner dirtbags with an abiding affection for each other and the fondness the movie has for them and their friendship is real and yes appealing. The scenes in which they just hang out and banter are the best in the movie aside from the random one in which Liam Neeson comes into Teds grocery store. Ted 2 works when the jokes are in some way on its heroes -- as in the unexpectedly hilarious exchange about F. Scott Fitzgerald or the sequence about how the pair spend their Tuesday nights.Guileless lovable moron is the best sort of role for Wahlberg who revels in the movies Boston-based jokes and has easy consistent chemistry with his computer-generated co-star. The first Ted put Mila Kunis in the thankless role of demanding John grow up and get some distance from the adorable-crass bear that was the movies whole reason for being. Shes gone by Ted 2 having divorced John and Amanda Seyfried appears in her place as the new lawyer helping Ted with his personhood case. She gets to smoke pot and shoot the shit with the boys and this time at least the movie doesnt set up a divide in which romantic relationships are the death of male friendships. View this image > Wahlberg Ted and Amanda Seyfried in Ted 2. Universal Pictures ID 6084616 That personhood case in which Ted goes to court to prove hes not property and that he deserves the rights of any human is the central example of how the movies aim is nowhere near sharp enough to draw the comparisons it does. The storyline is forever teetering on the verge of disaster throwing in references to Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson including a scene in which Ted watches Roots and exclaims ""Thats just like me""It is not just like him because he is a magical stuffed animal and slavery was a real historical atrocity. Ted 2 maintains just enough distance to suggest its aware that Teds comparisons of himself to oppressed minorities are inane while also being sincerely felt by the character. But its a close call the humor so haphazard that it actually takes a slur-filled line to clarify the films place. When the legal battle takes a turn against Ted he yells ""This is exactly what you been doin to the fags"" and then catches himself clarifying ""Sorry the homos"" Its a potentially ugly joke except that its not presented as a joke at all because Ted clearly means no slight by it -- hes ignorant but genuine in reaching for what he thinks of as more appropriate phrasing.Ted 2 is not a comedy about how the loss of a talking teddy bear makes its characters think they understand persecution but there are moments where its almost that movie. There are moments where it verges on a sly poke at people whove never previously thought about systemic oppression suddenly calling it out when something bad happens to them. Then it goes back to being a movie about a pot-smoking bear who makes dick jokes and lives (spoiler) happily ever after. Itll probably be a big hit.

Comments click to enlarge Ted 2 Video Rated R  115 minutes  2015 The tasteless teddy bear (given voice by writer-director Seth MacFarlane) and his emotionally retarded human pal (Mark Wahlberg) return for more snarky laughs in this sequel to the hit comedy Ted (2012) though as usual with MacFarlane the movie is so indifferently plotted that it soon becomes a bore. The opening credits offer an irresistible dance number with Ted fronting a line of tuxedoed grooms on a giant wedding cake; nothing that follows equals it though there is one priceless gag near the end in which moon-eyed Amanda Seyfried attending a Comic-Con convention comes face-to-face with her double--Gollum from Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings cycle.

Audiences made Ted one of the highest-grossing R-rated comedies ever. Theyll do it again with Ted 2 because even when MacFarlane pushes too hard and long he keeps the jokes gut-busting and laced with satirical bite. The tenderness between Ted and John -- Wahlberg plays this likable dim bulb with winning dexterity -- is an unexpected treat.

"Ted 2 - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Ted 2 Posted by Christy Lemire on June 28 2015 1 Comment Universal Pictures Rated R for crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug use. Running time 115 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four. If you liked the original ""Ted"" Seth MacFarlanes 2012 surprise smash about a pot-smoking potty-mouthed teddy bear then you will probably like ""Ted 2."" It is essentially the exact same movie and more -- and less. As director co-writer and star MacFarlane offers a lot of the same kind of brash and ballsy humor that is his trademark. Nothing is off limits. No one is spared. So if you have a problem with a slapsticky pratfall involving scads of semen followed by a wildly inappropriate joke about sickle cell anemia followed by a crass Kardashian reference (and its a loooong way to go for that punchline) then you should probably look elsewhere. Ill admit I laughed at that joke -- and at a lot of the jokes in ""Ted 2"" -- but Im also a longtime fan of MacFarlanes ""Family Guy"" for its energy daring rapid-fire pop-culture references and a willingness to go anywhere for a gag. (Our child can recite verbatim the entire Brian and Stewie ""Cool Whip"" exchange. Were good parents.) Along with fellow screenwriters and frequent collaborators Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild MacFarlane throws a lot of stuff at the wall. Not all of it sticks. But when it does stick it works like crazy. As in his television work and the original ""Ted"" some of the best bits here are the random non sequiturs flashbacks and fantasy sequences. My favorite joke in the whole movie involves Ted and his human best friend John (Mark Wahlberg) going to an improv comedy club to yell depressing suggestions to the performers on stage. Its a clever and bizarre idea well-executed. Having said that ""Ted 2"" is also overlong repetitive and self-indulgent. In trying to offer a substantial dramatic plot line about civil rights alongside the raunchy comedy its reach exceeds its grasp. And as in last summers ambitious failure ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" ""Ted 2"" makes you wish there were someone around to rein MacFarlane in and hone his instincts. Theres a brisk and irresistible 95-minute movie somewhere in here but as is so often the case MacFarlane cannot contain his excesses and it seems theres no one around him who can stop them either. The delightful wrongness of the central premise remains strong however. Ted (whom MacFarlane voices in a thick New England accent identical to Peter Griffins) has married his girlfriend gum-chomping grocery cashier Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). But John is now divorced from his wife (Mila Kunis unseen here) and in no time Ted is having marital troubles of his own. He and Tami-Lynn make the always-wise decision to have a baby to save the union but since Ted is a teddy bear he lacks the equipment to impregnate her. When trying to find a sperm donor fails to work -- including a truly uncomfortable visit to Tom Bradys house in the middle of the night in one of the films many celebrity cameos -- they try to adopt. But then that doesnt work either when Massachusetts state officials decide that Ted isnt an actual person but rather a piece of property. This leads John and Ted to seek the help of young up-and-coming lawyer (and fellow stoner) Sam L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) who agrees to work pro bono to prove that Ted is indeed a person. Sam doesnt know who Samuel L. Jackson is -- and doesnt get any pop-culture reference these guys throw at her -- because she actually studied and immersed herself in the classics and didnt waste her youth sitting on her ass on the couch watching bad television. MacFarlanes detractors often accuse him of misogyny but as was the case with Charlize Therons character in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" Seyfrieds character is the smartest and most capable person in the room at all times. Forcing her into a romantic subplot with Wahlbergs John seems needless but Seyfried is game for whatever comes her way. Despite her comic abilities though Seyfried is also stuck with some of the heavier material especially in long droning courtroom scenes that seriously bog down the films momentum. MacFarlane may try to enliven some of these moments with a spontaneous song or a profane outburst but its impossible to ignore the fact that this kind of meaty writing -- this desire to Say Something Important -- is beyond him and his team. Connections to civil rights fights throughout history harkening all the way to the atrocities of slavery seem poorly planned and tenuous. Maybe hes aiming for satire but he never truly hits his mark. But wait theres more. ""Ted 2"" features another subplot in which Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) the creepy dad from the original ""Ted"" tries to kidnap the bear at New York Comic-Con to present him to the head of Hasbro (John Carroll Lynch) as the basis for mass production. Nothing in this story line is ever funny or suspenseful; it could have been jettisoned entirely. ""Ted 2"" begins in much more lively and promising fashion than its eventual ending however with a wedding-themed Busby Berkeley-style production number during the opening titles thats beautifully choreographed and hugely entertaining. As in the first film the integration of this computer-generated creature in a live-action setting is seamless. This is yet another sign that MacFarlane needs to make an old-school musical next -- and hopefully if he does hell invite some seasoned folks to help him make his ideas truly sing.

JOHN SEMLEY Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 25 2015 1157AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 26 2015 1219PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Seth MacFarlane Written by Seth MacFarlane Alec Sulkin Wellesley Wild Starring Mark Wahlberg Seth MacFarlane Amanda Seyfried Giovanni Ribisi Classification 14A Country USA Language English To say that Seth MacFarlanes Ted 2 is an improvement on his last film A Million Ways to Die in the West is one of those ""damning with faint praise"" deals. That film was totally laughless. Ted 2 meanwhile coaxed exactly three laughs out of me during its 115-minute running time. Thats one laugh every 38 minutes. Or after some generous rounding up 0.03 laughs per minute. Granted Im a pretty easy laugh when it comes to jokes about Aerosmith frontman Steven Tylers insane face. Speaking of faces the saving grace of Ted 2 is that MacFarlanes is hidden behind the fuzzy not-unappealing form of the titular talking teddy bear who was magically brought to life in the first movie to pal around with his BFF John (Mark Wahlberg).The hardest thing about A Million Ways was watching MacFarlane whose caricaturish good looks - dimpled chin knowingly devilish glint in the eyes etc. - make him seem well weird. Theres this whole aesthetic theory about the ""uncanny valley."" It states that creations that appear and move in a way thats mostly-but-not-quite human can illicit revulsion in the viewer comparable to watching the antics of an animated corpse. MacFarlane is living breathing totally human proof of this theory. Theres something just...sort of...off about him. Yet as the voice of a swearing bong-hitting Bud Light-swilling teddy bear MacFarlane feels right at home.Ted 2 picks up with Ted marrying his longtime girlfriend Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). When the two plan to save their failing marriage by having a kid their adoption plans are stymied when its revealed that legally Ted isnt a person. Ted and John team up with an upstart lawyer named Sam Jackson (Amanda Seyfried; and yes they milk the ""Sam Jackson"" joke for all its worth which isnt much to begin with) to prove that Ted is just like you and me and not property of Hasbro which hopes to disassemble Ted and build living talking cursing teddy bears for all the children in the world.The plot has a certain Pinocchio ring. But it more directly recalls a Star Trek The Next Generation episode in which android officer Data has to demonstrate his personhood or else surrender to the tinkering of Starfleet scientists who hope to replicate his unique consciousness.MacFarlane acknowledges the debt by inserting STTNG cast members Michael Dorn and Patrick Stewart in minor roles and figuring the shows Enterprise starship prominently in a sequence set at New York Citys Comic Con. Considering the number of times MacFarlane has been accused of ripping off ideas and characterizations acknowledging his Star Trek debt with a wink and a nudge is a canny move.But then this is MacFarlanes whole tack as a comedian. He appropriates and recycles pop culture in the most fatuous and self-satisfied way. Recognize a famous character like Gollum or Obi-Wan Kenobi and youre in on the joke. Its the kind of thing that gets called ""irreverent"" but that would presume anyone is reverent of My Little Pony or the Kool-Aid Man or Chucky from the Childs Play movies. What it reveals isnt so much a satiric sensibility as a readiness to please to show viewers that hes just like them - breathing the suffocating air of the same pop cultural ecosystem.It all culminates an a Comic Con melee with Transformers and Imperial Stormtroopers bouncing off one another as Godzilla knocks down a pyramid made of Play-Doh cans. This is MacFarlanes idea of comedy in a nutshell smash some easy pop references together and itll be funny.But MacFarlanes eagerness is never more apparent than in his bent toward the saccharine. He wants to do the silly parody stuff of Mel Brooks. He wants to do the bromantic riffing and dick-and-fart jokes of Judd Apatow. He wants to be the Hollywood song-and-dance-man as dopey schlub. But he also wants the swooning strings and big emotions of Frank Capra.That he tackily hangs Teds fight for legal personhood on references to gay marriage the Civil Rights movement and Americas history of slavery (this has to be the only movie that references both Dred Scott and Rocky IIIs Clubber Lang) isnt so much topical as it is openly disrespectful.MacFarlane wants to prove that theres something like a heart beating somewhere inside that densely-packed stuffing of pop reference and juvenile humour. He wants his sappy faux-poignant emotional moments but has no idea how to sell them without warping himself into some repugnant pose. Its as hard to watch as his attempts to contort his smug smiling face for comic effect in his last movie. And in a way its pitiable more than anything.Like Ted the swearing bear Seth MacFarlane just want to be a real boy.

Laughing yet?John (Mark Wahlberg) top and Ted (voiced by Seth Macfarlane) are Thunder Buddies for life in the comedy sequel ""Ted 2.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Ted 2"" opens with Ted the foul-mouthed Teddy bear who starred in Seth MacFarlanes raunchy 2012 smash ""Ted"" marrying the girl of his dreams. ""Im going to go 50 Shades of Bear on you tonight"" he tells his bride illustrating the depth of humor MacFarlane is utilizing in this lazy phoned-in follow-up.""Ted 2"" doesnt get much better or try much harder than ""50 Shades of Bear."" Take a warmed-over pop culture reference already pushing its expiration date twist it by putting it in the mouth of a Teddy bear (voiced by MacFarlane) and serve it to the people. Is it funny? Is it even a joke? Doesnt matter; ""Ted 3"" is probably already in the works.""Ted 2"" slogs along at a laborious pace with set piece after set piece designed solely to keep the running time going. The movies holy trinity of humor revolves around Boston the male anatomy and homophobia and in some sequences -- including one involving New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady -- it manages to mash all three together. Huzzah Semen jokes abound porn gags are high-fived over. Fraternities will sing its praises for years.But only in rare instances does it push past the lowest common denominator. Writer/director MacFarlane who penned the script with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild thinks making a Teddy bear say inappropriate things is the height of comedy. It wasnt the first time around though its 550 million worldwide gross said many people thought otherwise. ""Ted 2"" is designed to keep the boat afloat and ride the high tide.There are occasional flashes that MacFarlane wants more. His affinity for Old Hollywood glitz and glamour is displayed in the dazzling opening credits sequence which plays like a Busby Berkeley musical and finds Ted dancing alongside a chorus line of tuxedo-clad guys and dolled-up gals. There are no jokes and no attempts to undercut the scene its a straight up homage to yesteryear. But the bubble is soon burst and were back to jokes about weed and porn which are about as fresh as the old ""Family Guy"" scripts from which they likely originated.The movie centers on Teds attempts to be recognized as a human which MacFarlane uncomfortably uses to draw parallels to Dred Scott and the legalization of gay marriage. Ted and his best bud John (a glazed-over Mark Wahlberg) hire a young lawyer (a slumming Amanda Seyfried) who tries his case but only when the movie feels like focusing on that storyline does any of it matter. Elsewhere theres a road trip some celebrity cameos a side plot about a creep who wants to kidnap Ted (Giovanni Ribisi returning from the first film) a sequence at New York Comic Con -- anything to keep things moving. The stakes are kept low and the humor is scattershot with a surprising number of jokes landing with loud empty thuds.For a movie that pretends to address issues of what it means to be human ""Ted 2"" is soulless at its core a pure product. Its ""50 Shades of Bear"" and theyre all drab.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaTed 2GRADE D+Rated R for crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug useRunning time 108 minutes 25 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1LyFeAK MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/06/25/movie-review-seth-macfarlane-aims-low-scores-lower-lame-ted/29297985/,200,ted25,ted2,detroitnews
"Ted 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ted-2 ) Ted 2 (United States 2015) June 26 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli The original Ted was an engagingly ribald comedy that worked in large part because the gimmick was fresh. After all Teddy Bears even on those rare occasions when they talk dont normally curse smoke weed and engage in sexual pantomime. At the time of its release the movie seemed like a one-off and it probably should have been left that way. The sequel disappoints in large part because it doesnt bring anything new to the table. Ted (voiced by director/co-writer Seth MacFarlane) is not substantially different than in the first film and the bloom is off the rose. The film fumbles its lame narrative and although some of MacFarlanes jokes are hilarious theyre just blips on the radar. The film once again begins with the dulcet tones of narrator Patrick Stewart (one of three Star Trek personages appearing in the film - the other two being Michael Dorn and Nana Visitor) saying things one doesnt expect someone of his stature to say. The first scene shows the marriage of Ted to Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). Teds Best Man John (Mark Wahlberg) is down in the dumps because his wife Lori has left him. After this setup things jump ahead a year. The bear/human marriage isnt going well and Ted decides that having a baby might be the solution. Once artificial insemination is determined to be a non-starter Ted and Tami opt for adoption. This results in an official government declaration that Ted isnt eligible to adopt because hes ""property"" not a person. Ted and John obtain legal representation from an inexperienced lawyer named ""Sam(antha) L. Jackson"" (Amanda Seyfried) and decide to fight for Teds civil rights in court. It would be disingenuous for me to claim that Ted 2 isnt funny. Although I was often bored by the plodding direction of the story I laughed from time-to-time. MacFarlane employs the ""saturation humor"" approach favored by Zucker-Abrams-Zucker (Airplane The Naked Gun). In this environment the audience is bombarded by so many jokes that even a 50% success rate is considered good. (Id peg Ted 2 at significantly lower than that.) There are some hilarious cameos - Jay Lenos blink-and-youll-miss-him is one and Liam Neesons is deliciously odd. (The Tom Brady appearance however doesnt work nor does Morgan Freemans oh-so-serious turn.) Theres a lovely little homage to Jurassic Park. Michael Dorn who played the Klingon Worf in a couple of Star Trek series gets to dress in a Worf costume when he goes to Comic-Con.  And theres a line about Amanda Seyfrieds eyes that I wont spoil here. Subtlety has never been one of MacFarlanes notable qualities and his sledgehammer approach to civil rights lacks only a flashing neon sign announcing ""Allegory"" The snarky cynicism evident in lines of dialogue makes it unclear whether MacFarlane is advocating equality or lampooning it. Maybe its intended to be both but it doesnt really work as either. And whenever Ted 2 draws an historical parallel it spells it out rather than leaving it to the audience to make the connection. The chemistry between Mark Wahlberg who appears to be phoning in his one-note performance and the bear is less apparent than in the first film. Perhaps thats because Ted was about the human/toy relationship while its only a tangential aspect of Ted 2. In fact John is so unnecessarily that he could have been replaced by anyone willing to banter with a CGI bear. Newcomer Amanda Seyfried adds the sex appeal lost by the departure of Mila Kunis (who dropped out due to her pregnancy). Seyfried does a credible job with the good girl/bad girl dynamic of her character a sweet innocent-looking lawyer whose first word is the f-bomb and who climbs up on her desk barefooted and whips out a bong. Meanwhile Jessica Barth and Giovanni Ribisi are simply annoying (probably by intent). Comedy sequels are almost never as good as the originals that spawn them and Ted 2 is not an exception. Yes there are some laughs but MacFarlane has not yet been able to show hes capable of keeping the comedic momentum going for a full-length feature. The story isnt the only problem. Theres a sense that the movie plays it too safe at times. The Busby Berkley opening number is oddly straightforward. The sperm donor clinic scenes fall back on regurgitated material. And surprisingly little is done with the Comic-Con setting of the third act (outside of some gags with Michael Dorn and Patrick Warburton). Ted 2 has enough laughs to make it passable late night cable TV fare. But summer destination movies need considerably more than what this threadbare sequel has to offer.

"Dumber Than Your Average Bear << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Watch Kristaps Porzingiss Pro Day  Next Shed Be Hella Proud Universal Pictures Facebook Twitter Print Movies Dumber Than Your Average Bear Seth MacFarlane reaches new lows with Ted 2 by Wesley Morris on June 24 2015 It takes about 10 seconds for the funniest moment in Ted 2 to become the worst. Mind you ""worst"" in a movie like this -- one from Seth MacFarlane whose sense of humor generally bodes about as well for moviegoers as a dorsal fin does for swimmers -- doubles as a badge of honor. The movies opening title sequence is a musical number in which Ted -- that magical teddy bear first brought to insult-comic life by MacFarlane in 2012 -- and dancers in formalwear frolic around a skyscraping wedding cake. Its like something out of Mel Brooks but utterly sincere. The bear slides along a piano keyboard and leaps along the male dancers top hats. The leaping feels right for MacFarlane and Ted 2. He wont be happy until he has danced on your head. Anyway that moment. Its at a fertility clinic. For this sequel Ted has wed his girlfriend Tami-Lynn McCafferty (Jessica Barth) and after that wedding cake sequence the movie flashes forward a year to a life of shouting matches in their Boston apartment. Their fellow supermarket cashier Joy (Cocoa Brown) senses discord and crassly suggests a baby. But Ted is anatomically ill-equipped to create one -- or to provide adequate sexual pleasure as Tami-Lynn might add in a Boston accent that has traveled the I-95 corridor from Queens. After some fruitless digressions Ted asks his dim luckless nominally human best friend John (Mark Wahlberg) to donate his sperm which leads to the clinic where John is childishly eager to show Ted his load in a room piled high with the canistered donations of other men. You never expect a movie to hurt you. Disappoint? Dismay? Depress? Fine. But when a movie has a field day asserting the humanity of a fake toy bear at the expense of your own it hurts. I was led to believe in part by the posters that I was getting a movie about a character whod be masturbating or urinating with his back to us. They shouldve turned Ted around since the emissions are aimed at the audience. One giant rack of apparently unfastened containers falls on John leaving him soaking and screaming on the floor. Ted laughs. So do we because watching Walhberg degrade himself this emphatically is funny. Its one of the few times in any movie that an emotion really surfaces on his face and that the emotion is disgust somehow makes it funnier. Someone from the clinic comes in alarmed but says not to worry. Johns only been doused with the unusable sperm of men with sickle cell. Theres no explanation of sickle cells being a blood disease that potentially affects the health of about 100000 Americans most of whom are African American. Theres just Ted connecting the dots enough to say through his laughter that John shouldnt feel bad. ""You see that? Youre covered in rejected black guys sperm"" he says. ""Youre like a Kardashian"" Its possible that at the theater where you watch this movie the initial laughter will be too loud to hear Teds punch line. But I imagine that if Kanye West were to wind up in the audience the punch would feel actionably real. MacFarlanes inept attempt to meat-grind race into comedy doesnt end there. Ted and John share a running joke about the predominance of black penises on the Internet. (Youre always no more than two clicks away John more or less says.) And when Ted and Tami-Lynn discover that -- because she was once a junkie-whore -- children arent possible biologically they attempt to adopt only to be told that Ted isnt a human. Hes property. There goes his cashier job his bank account and his dignity. There also went my patience. The movie turns Teds fight for personhood into its cause. For representation they wind up with Amanda Seyfried as Samantha an expensive attorneys much cheaper niece who dashes off some of the civil rights movements greatest legal hits to brush up on the case all while getting stoned with her clients and surfing a John Hughes-style montage of high jinks. Maybe this is why they lose the case and take a road trip to Manhattan to convince an actual civil rights lawyer to take up their cause. Hes played by Morgan Freeman whose participation suggests a customized script in which references to black semen and black penises have been redacted. Its strange enough that Freeman would endorse MacFarlanes bankrupt evocations of justice and equality by loaning the movie his movie-god status -- but a film like this demonstrates the hollowness at the core of that omnipotence Hes basically doing butler work for the bear. Universal Pictures You never expect a movie to hurt you. Disappoint? Dismay? Depress? Fine. But when a movie has a field day asserting the humanity of a fake toy bear at the expense of your own it hurts. I was led to believe in part by the posters that I was getting a movie about a character whod be masturbating or urinating with his back to us. They shouldve turned Ted around since the emissions are aimed at the audience. Its tricky. MacFarlane would seem to identify as progressive but he uses his liberalness conservatively to berate what he thinks is normal or safe or established in American culture. His tolerance is tinged with intolerance. In Ted 2 Michael Dorn and Patrick Warburton play a brutally masculine interracial gay couple. Dorn played Lieutenant Worf on Star Trek The Next Generation. Warburton among other characters played a live-action TV superhero called the Tick. Here they show up at New York Comic Con in their respective costumes and lay waste to nerds. At that moment the gag moves from their being absurdist gays (""Were gonna tie our dicks together"") to their being bullies irrespective of their gayness. Where precisely the joke is depends on what you find funny at either extreme. MacFarlanes sense of humor is at its best when it conflates innocence with the asinine. At the grocery store Liam Neeson turns in an amusingly weird cameo as one of his brooding tough guys trying to buy a box of Trix. Neeson commits to the deviancy of buying something ""for kids."" Its random and very funny. But MacFarlane has always done situational randomness well. Take the Tom Brady scene from the trailer Before Ted asks John for his sperm they break into Bradys bedroom to steal his and MacFarlane has Ted show up dressed prophylactically as Paddington Bear. But MacFarlane -- writing once again with Wellesley Wild and Alec Sulkin -- isnt sophisticated or honest enough to unpack his sexual and racial fantasies and hangups. He just spews them. Ted becoming a person includes the acquiring of a surname. He chooses Clubber Lang after the villain Mr. T played in Rocky III. Samanthas full name turns out to be Sam L. Jackson but shes been too busy getting high and studying the law to know who that is. Either way her cluelessness is the premise for a series of limp jokes predicated upon racial ignorance. As a filmmaker MacFarlane makes a show of how easy it is to assume a black affiliation and cherry-pick from black cultural and political history. America just rode a wave of speculation and revulsion over Rachel Dolezal the white woman whos been living for years as a black one. With MacFarlane the appropriation is both too much and not enough. Dolezal has remained committed to her performance. She believes she is what she says she is. But MacFarlane doesnt appear to believe in anything. He just likes to mess around with things that still have value without seeming to get whether that value is greater than his jokes. Its as if he doesnt really know what hes laughing at or care what race and sexuality and gender are. Its as if he doesnt know women or black people -- just white comedy writers who love to make fun of them. For some reason the movie has Ted and John watch LeVar Burton as Kunta Kinte receiving a whipping in Roots for refusing to accept his American plantation name. Teds gleeful embrace of the Clubber Lang name mocks that determination. ""Thats just like me"" he says of Burtons character. I suppose it could have been with a satirist capable of or interested in taking that kind of ridiculousness as far as it can go. Theres plenty of Roots comedy out there. Its a miniseries not a sacrosanct text. And MacFarlane is comedian enough to sense the musty camp that comes off this movie now. But MacFarlanes joke in this scene is that Teds empathy is backward. Its not the whipped he should be identifying with. Its the whipper. MacFarlane doesnt have a measuring stick long enough to take in the incongruity between a beaten black body and his teddy bears narcissism. His tolerant intolerance is lazy and incurious. The black characters are all movie-servant class1 -- Dennis Haysbert might be a doctor Ron Canada might be a judge but its in the same way that Morgan Freemans a lawyer. In the movies these are menial jobs for women and people of color spending their slivers of screen time handing out advice bits of plot and verdicts. And add to that the scene where the cashier Joy demonstrates Ted and Tami-Lynns fitness for parenthood by pointing to a nonblack couple cooing over a baby as ""those white n---s."" Twice. That sort of comedy veers into territory beyond MacFarlanes understanding. Hes included that line from Joy as a defense against anything on tap for later. He might have equated this teddy bear with oppressed black people who once were legally three-fifths a person. But he never called anybody the n-word. This is probably not the moment for Ted 2 a time when a young white man can sit among a group of black Charleston churchgoers for the better part of an hour before taking out his weapon and shooting nine of them dead; one in which the ensuing conversation focuses on whether the cause was racism and why we have to keep going there even after its been demonstrated that the shooter was well steeped in white-supremacist concerns. Its one in which the president can come under fire for saying the n-word as though he were using it the way Joy does in MacFarlanes movie; and one in which the cross-racial outrage over the racist flag that waves on the South Carolina capitol lawn reached such a political pitch that for the first time theres actually a possibility that it could be removed. In one sense MacFarlane is just making dick and personhood jokes in a commercial comedy that is gleefully marketed to all. But for the people who own those penises who rarely in American movies experience equal personhood this can sting. That of course isnt all. Part of the Charleston shooters pre-massacre statement apparently expressed contempt for black sexuality (""You rape our women""). That contempt is almost as old as this country. But its expression from a 21-year-old unemployed landscaper and a very popular 41-year-old entertainer would seem to suggest that its not going anywhere soon. For people of color some aspect of friendship with white people involves an awareness that you could be dropped through a trapdoor of racism at any moment by a slip of the tongue or at a campus party or in a legislative campaign. But its not always anticipated. You dont expect the young white man whos been seated alongside you in a house of worship to take your life because youre black. Nor do you expect that a movie about an obscene teddy bear would invoke a sexual stereotype forced upon you the way Kunta Kinte was forced to become ""Toby."" MacFarlane goes a step further daring to commit a defensive racial consecration along the way. When Ted and John lift the bedsheet over Tom Bradys genitals theyre bathed in the same golden light that shined from whatevers in that briefcase in Pulp Fiction. Calling Bradys junk holy would be funnier if this movie werent simultaneously implying that Cam Newtons is scary. MacFarlanes insecurity is what it is his. But in that fertility clinic he has aimed some of that sense of inadequacy at a multiracial family with diverse sexualities that unthinkably through its very public existence has come to represent revolutionary love compassion and social imagination. So to see Wahlberg wailing in a pool of semen is to recognize a great truth that still appalls disparate pockets of this country Were all Kardashians now. The women all do what youd expect them to do in a dude movie -- as do the nerds.

Photo Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Ted 2 Running time 118 minutes. Rated R (profanity crude humor drug abuse sexual references). Sequels to comedies tend to be superfluous. Did we really need a follow-up to ""Airplane""? Or ""The Hangover""? Or ""The Phantom Menace""? ""Ted 2"" was also unnecessary and the movies as much of a mess as the scene in which the boys extravagantly mismanage an encounter with a rack of sperm donations. Yet ""Ted 2"" has so many moments of crazy brilliance that I laughed a lot if infrequently. Is a ballplayer who whiffs four times but hits the ball 500 feet on his fifth try worth watching? I say yes. Mark Wahlberg (from left) Ted and Amanda Seyfried in ""Ted 2."" Ted now married to Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) -- while best friend John (Mark Wahlberg) has gotten divorced -- wants to have a baby to make her happy. But despite his fondness for porn (at his bachelor party he watches grizzlies mate) Ted cant produce a cub. His quest for fatherhood brings the full force of state scrutiny on him He is ruled a nonperson loses his job and even has his Papa Johns loyalty card revoked. Needing a lawyer he hires a rookie (Amanda Seyfried) so young he worries that she might sing ""Frozen"" songs in her opening arguments. If the first films fantasy-celebrity nexus was a collision of ""E.T."" the movie and ""ET"" the gossip show the second approaches civil rights from the general direction of Kafka. Ted at trial must prove he is a person not property. Surely anyone who can tell weed jokes is human? Like Kafkas Joseph K. Ted lacks a last name though unlike Joseph Ted chooses one Clubberlang. Its the Mr. T character from ""Rocky III."" Writer-director Seth MacFarlane who again performs the voice of the foulmouthed teddy bear has a cluttered and interesting mind. He has created an existential d -  - k joke of a movie one that ruminates on Thomas Jefferson Dred Scott and the 13th Amendment in the course of presenting a penis-shaped bong an attempted burglary of Tom Bradys manly essence and an investigative report on Jay Lenos mens room perversions. Jessica Barth as Teds wife Tami-Lynn.Photo Universal Pictures The sweetness of the first film though has been displaced by arrogance This is a directors cut of a movie with four musical interludes a long road trip and many failed attempts to revive the Flash Gordon gags from ""Ted."" MacFarlane can leave no joke behind. If he had cut out the worst 30 minutes ""Ted 2"" might have been great. Still by this point MacFarlane is like that attractively errant friend you have to keep up with. Its as if he has every comedy channel going at the same time. He loves a joke about shaking up a beer the way he loves old-school musicals and absurdism (among the forest animals gathered to hear a lovely ballad are a raccoon a fox and a lobster). Theres sharp dialogue (""We dont know any lawyers. All our friends make sandwiches"") insult comedy (the comparison of Seyfried to a famous movie villain is brilliant) and a parody of 80s movie montages. Then there are forays into the nihilistic and the dark MacFarlane is a guy who was almost killed on 9/11 who makes 9/11 jokes. Theres a Robin Williams reference too. MacFarlane isnt an intellectual but he isnt just a gross-out comic either. Like 1970s Woody Allen he is attuned to thanatos as well as eros; he may not read books but hes heard of many of them. Really hes a song-and-dance man who takes the measure of the void the missing link between Sammy Davis Jr. and Samuel Beckett.

"Review Ted 2 is overstuffed and absurd but wickedly funny - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Ted 2 is overstuffed and absurd but wickedly funny Ted 2 Universal Pictures John (Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) keep their friendship going through life changes in ""Ted 2."" John (Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) keep their friendship going through life changes in ""Ted 2."" (Universal Pictures) Rebecca KeeganContact Reporter One joke in ""Ted 2"" potentially offends women African Americans couples struggling with infertility sufferers of blood disorders people who make medical shelving and the Kardashians. I laughed so hard at it that I waited for security to emerge from the theater aisles escort me out and force me to watch sensitivity training videos with my eyes propped open like Malcolm McDowells character in ""A Clockwork Orange.""What does it mean that I responded so strongly to this joke? Surely I will burn. But maybe so will you because while ""Ted 2"" is absurd and occasionally disgusting it is also wickedly funny. This sequel to the 2012 R-rated comedy about a magical pot-smoking teddy bear reunites the appealing computer-animated character voiced by writer-director Seth MacFarlane with his human best friend the joyfully doltish John (Mark Wahlberg). Together they embody the comedy truths that a cute cuddly toy can get away with anything and a Boston accent is inherently entertaining.With a fuzzy bear Busby Berkeley number a ""Breakfast Club"" homage and impassioned courtroom speeches that could be delivered by Atticus Finch ""Ted 2"" is also surprisingly earnest. The movies singular high-low tone springs from MacFarlanes strange fecund brain the same one that brought us the ribald animated TV show ""Family Guy"" the odd comedy western ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" and the controversial Oscar night ode ""We Saw Your Boobs."" The too-shaggy plot gets in motion after Ted marries brassy gum-chewing grocery checkout girl Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) and despite the plush toy grooms anatomical challenges they decide to have a child enlisting a now divorced and depressed John in an attempted sperm heist. When that fails a bid for adoption leads to questions about Teds legal status and they meet newbie lawyer Samantha a loopy Amanda Seyfried. Ted 2 Universal Pictures While the first ""Ted"" was an origins story the sequel expands on Teds uncertain place in the world. While the first ""Ted"" was an origins story the sequel expands on Teds uncertain place in the world. (Universal Pictures) Samanthas one maddening character flaw as far as Ted and John are concerned is her pop-culture cluelessness; she knows her Dred Scott v. Sandford but not her starship Enterprise v. Millennium Falcon. Like MacFarlanes Oscar night musical number many misinterpreted as a sexist joke at the expense of the actresses it featured Ted and Johns irritation is a comment on their puerile value system not Samanthas.Thats a tricky needle to thread and MacFarlane doesnt always manage it. When Ted watches ""Roots"" and likens his own struggle to Kunta Kintes brutal whipping the butt of the joke is meant to be Ted not the human misery of slavery. But the thing about human misery is its kind of hard to breeze by. Ted 2 official trailer The trailer for ""Ted 2"" was released online on Thursday January 29 2015. The movie is set to open on June 26. The trailer for ""Ted 2"" was released online on Thursday January 29 2015. The movie is set to open on June 26. See more videos The brazen performance of black female comic Cocoa Brown who plays a fellow cashier at the grocery store where Ted and Tami-Lynn work is like a one-woman rebuttal to that scene delivering a tart history of slavery. More of her voice would have helped the movie in many ways. While the first ""Ted"" was an origins story the sequel expands on Teds uncertain place in the world with John continuing his role as straight man and loyal idiotic co-conspirator. The overstuffed story takes one too many detours -- including an inane set piece at New York Comic-Con -- and the ubiquitous Hasbro product placement is distracting. The movies best jokes are simple and visual like the sight of Ted dressed in rain gear to procure Tom Bradys sperm.Though several celebrity cameos in ""Ted 2"" are apt to spark some chatter the movies silent heroes are the character animators who created its leading man. Like Carroll OConnors Archie Bunker or Jackie Gleasons Ralph Kramden it is the sweetness of the performance the communication of sadness or hurt with the lift of a furry eyebrow or swat of a paw that lends the horrible words coming out of Teds mouth their texture and pathos.In the courtroom when Ted drops a slur for gay men and then another in a misguided attempt to link his civil rights struggle with theirs only a blind person could think he actually hates gay people. Hes ignorant yes but hes not a bigot.Its a conundrum of MacFarlanes career that he depends on viewers to grasp the nuance of that moment at the same time that they should be the kind of people who genuinely enjoy a good Kardashian joke. How much does the Venn diagram of those two groups overlap? I dont know. I just know Im in it.

He unleashes all that and more in hyperactive fashion before the opening credits even finish in Ted 2.Boston working-class guy John (Mark Wahlberg) and his childhood-friend-come-to-life the foul-mouthed Ted (voiced by MacFarlane who also directs) return for more politically incorrect misadventures in the fitfully hilarious but needlessly overstuffed comedy sequel ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide).The story picks up with both ""thunder buddies for life"" in the dumps. John has already divorced the first films love interest (Mila Kunis noticeably AWOL here) and after getting married in the first scene Ted and his wife Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) are far from the picture of domestic bliss a year later.USA TODAYReview Emotions run wild in Inside OutA bear and a woman getting hitched is apparently totally normal for everyone but the state of Massachusetts. When Ted and Tami-Lynn decide to adopt a baby -- after a late-night mission to get Tom Bradys sperm goes horribly awry -- the government get a whiff and annuls their marriage downgrading him from ""person"" to ""property.""Rookie lawyer Samantha (Amanda Seyfried) takes on their case to get the state to recognize Ted as more than a talking stuffed toy and she makes up for her complete lack of pop-culture knowledge by enjoying the wonders of weed and pelting joggers with apples.USA TODAYFive most awkward Ted interactionsMacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild have a gift for referential riffs but the plot is the thinnest of narratives just to connect all the comedy bits. Because something has to get us from Cookie Crisps being tossed down a blind guys butt crack to an all-out nerd fight at New York Comic Con.There are no sacred cows for MacFarlane Charlie Hebdo Obamacare Ferguson and Deflategate all get to be punchlines at some point sometimes cringingly so but the actors too are game. (Kudos to Seyfried for being cool with being compared to Gollum from The Lord of the Rings.)USA TODAYReview Dinos still rule Jurassic WorldBut having a comedy with slavery references sharing screen time with Wahlberg being covered with an avalanche of semen rings a bit odd even with Morgan Freeman around as a crusading civil-rights attorney. Its par for the humorous course For every two smart gut-busting gags theres one that whiffs and everyones bound to get offended at least a little.USA TODAYSeyfried shows raunch-ability in Ted 2At just under two hours Ted 2 meanders too often from its focal twosome; a subplot involving the first films antagonist Giovanni Ribisis creepy teddy-adoring Donny is completely meaningless. The celebrity cameos are all top notch and its fun watching Patrick Warburton and Michael Dorn play gay lovers while also sending up their characters in The Tick and Star Trek The Next Generation respectively. A returning Sam Jones of cult Flash Gordon fame also gets to play more with his aging coke-snorting screen persona.Ted 2 locks into a nice groove whenever its just Ted and John being buds (and smoking bud) and Seyfried actually adds to the chemistry. If only the nonstop parade of craziness and lack of story coherence around them wasnt so hard to bear. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1Ly4xTH",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/06/25/ted-2-movie-review/29205029/,200,ted211,ted2,usatoday
"Ted 2 returns with unbearably crude humour and cheap laughs review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTed 2 returns with unbearably crude humour and cheap laughs review Seth MacFarlane enjoys playing a crude teddy bear so much it seems almost cruel not to mention redundant to point out that his comedy sequel Ted 2 is wildly racist sexist profane juvenile -- and occasionally funny.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 25 2015Ted 2Starring Mark Wahlberg Seth MacFarlane (voice) Amanda Seyfried Jessica Barth and Giovanni Ribisi. Directed by Seth MacFarlane. At GTA theatres. 115 minutes. 14ASeth MacFarlane enjoys playing a crude teddy bear so much it seems almost cruel not to mention redundant to point out yet again that his humour is wildly racist sexist profane and juvenile.It can also be funny although the laughter is mainly of the guilty I-cant-believe-he-just-said-that kind.Article Continued BelowWhich leads us to Ted 2 and also a consumer warning. If you didnt see and laugh at the first Ted and maybe also at MacFarlanes button-pushing TV series Family Guy then another movie deserves your entertainment dollars.Mark Wahlberg and Amanda Seyfried and their bruin companion hit the road in Ted 2.This sequel to the riotously successful 2012 summer comedy has MacFarlane again directing co-writing and voicing the title bruin a sentient toy with a deceptively sweet face and the filthiest of minds and mouths.Also back is Mark Wahlberg as doofus sidekick John Teds loyal ""thunder buddy for life"" who strangely seems to have a fake Boston accent even though Wahlberg hails from Beantown.Jessica Barth returns as Teds human girlfriend Tami-Lynn who figures more prominently in the story. Another encore is Giovanni Ribisis bear-napping loner Donny who is superfluous to both of these overlong movies.Ted 2 is every bit as over-the-top as its predecessor with all the bong hits beer guzzling and penis jokes this implies. Song-and-dance routines suggest MacFarlane really hankers to do an old-fashioned Disney musical. But the absurdity of the overall concept reaches new heights.After blithely accepting Ted as a living thing in the first film Ted 2 seeks to prove hes a person not merely a material freak of magic. He wants to legally marry his grocery store co-worker Tami-Lynn and also have a child with her either through artificial insemination (since he lacks the requisite man parts) or adoption.This requires not only huge suspension of disbelief but also a lawyer to argue the case. Enter Amanda Seyfried whose courtroom advocate Samantha L. Jackson (see what they did there?) is the not-so-secret weapon of Ted 2.She succeeds Mila Kunis Wahlbergs love interest from the first Ted. Her absence is reportedly due to real-world pregnancy.Seyfried makes for a better-than-expected replacement and not just to play the straight woman for sexist jokes although there are plenty of those along with a running gag about her resemblance to a Tolkien film character.She does things you dont expect and makes you laugh without feeling guilty. Seyfried sifts gold from the dross of Ted 2s screenplay which MacFarlane co-wrote with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild and which tries really hard to be dumb and smart at the same time.The films many celebrity cameos either satirize things we expect of people such as a certain action stars taciturn manner or attempt to shock us with things we dont expect such as a late-show comedians supposed predilection for random washroom sex.Its hit-and-miss stuff but when it connects it really does. When Ted and John covertly assess the massiveness of a sport stars manhood in one of the films best moments the scene amusingly brings to mind Wahlbergs early fame as the endowed porn star of Boogie Nights.And you cant help but grin at a stoners take on Jurassic Park replete with John Williams inspirational original score. In your face Jurassic WorldOther times these smart alecks are too clever by half and too full of themselves to recognize that a joke is improved by brevity not length or repetition.Repeated comparisons between Teds quest for person status and the civil rights struggles of enslaved black people are neither appropriate nor funny even when a character in the film calls out Ted for making the connection.Its also a little weird to see a revered actor one who played a legendary freedom fighter in another film get involved in Teds legal quest. For those who desire to be seen as a good sport anything goes just as its apparently OK for MacFarlane to voice offensive things as long as he has a cuddly bear saying them.One persons unspeakably bad taste is another persons daring comedy. Ted 2 has a joke about the Charlie Hebdo office massacre that is appalling even by this movies low standards -- yet its exactly the kind of humour Charlie Hebdo would celebrate so what are we to think?I can picture Ted on the cover of Charlie Hebdo doing something outrageous. Thats actually a more appealing thought than the inevitability of a Ted 3.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

That might be the meanest sentence I have ever written about anyone including George W. Bush Uwe Boll and the Australian dude with weird hair who sells ""pickup artist"" videos to losers on the Internet. Seriously though that captures the potential and the limitations of MacFarlanes brand of comedy pretty well. Like Sandler hes a dude who revels in dude humor that most oppressed persecuted and underrepresented of comic modes where the boundary between self-mockery and outright stupidity is never entirely clear. (Is there an emoji that lets you know Im being facetious while also expressing something that some people actually believe?)Somewhat to his credit MacFarlane seeks to create a safe zone for dudeliness while subtly expanding its range. In his new foulmouthed teddy-bear sequel ""Ted 2"" as in its predecessor - yes MacFarlane has now made two movies about a talking stuffed bear and isnt America marvelous? - he suggests that dudes can still be dudes can still ogle hot chicks and revile yuppies who exercise and improvise lyrics to the ""Law amp; Order"" theme song while baked all without hating women or LGBT folks or people of color. Thats progress of a kind but its important to note that Sandler plays that melody too just in a dumber and more acutely agonizing key. Could any major Hollywood star possibly be upstaged in his own movie by Vanilla Ice? Sandler could which is a tribute to his genius of a sort.Like Sandler MacFarlane identifies as a dude from Boston or rather from BAUWHS-ton with the obligatory set of cultural obsessions to match. Theres an overly long gag in ""Ted 2"" about the fact that Ted the living teddy bear and Mark Wahlbergs ""Thunderbuddy for life"" cannot stop himself from singing along to Neil Diamonds ""Sweet Caroline"" even at risk of imminent dismemberment. (What does an undeniably infectious pop hit from 1969 by a guy from Brooklyn have to do with Boston? Im glad you asked.)MacFarlane is not quite as fixated on obscure New England sports marginalia as Sandler is; ""Ted 2"" is free of Hartford Whalers jerseys or University of New Hampshire baseball tees. In fact ""Ted 2"" wanders as far afield as ComicCon in New York where Ted and his former owner sad-sack divorce John (Mark Wahlberg) and their lawyer Sam (Amanda Seyfried) come face to face with Darth Vader and Lt. Worf from ""Star Trek The Next Generation"" and Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"" which is meant to be funny because of an extended joke about how Sam the nerdy-cute lawyer kind of looks like him. By the time we get there though it has that pounded-with-a-leaden-hammer quality understood by dude-humor fans and practitioners as a virtue.If youre getting the impression that ""Ted 2"" is a pointless and deliberately absurd reworking of an idea MacFarlane pretty well wore out the first time you would be right. Which is not to say I didnt laugh on several occasions including the ones where MacFarlane dares you to decide he has gone too far into patently offensive territory. Theres a Kardashian-related joke involving Wahlberg lying on the floor of a fertility clinic with the contents of dozens of jars of sperm specimens all over him that I cannot come close to repeating and where your first reaction may well be OMG thats incredibly racist before realizing that no its not exactly racist its just crude and mean and calculated to provoke outrage. In its better non-jizz-related moments ""Ted 2"" is a loosey-goosey stoner road trip with an irrelevant appealing blend of innocence and sweetness John and Sam doing a ""Walk Like an Egyptian"" dance number in the law library for no particular reason or the ""Law amp; Order"" theme-song lyrics a bit of brilliant standup material stuck in the middle of a movie. You Might Also Like The problem with MacFarlane -- who directed and produced the movie and co-wrote the screenplay with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild -- has nothing to do with his gifts as a comedian and showman which are considerable. (Lets stipulate that many people will not agree there is a problem with MacFarlane ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" notwithstanding.) Its all a question of packaging and containment. I will continue to defend the actual content and presumed intentions (as I see them) of MacFarlanes disastrous turn as Oscar host in 2013 but his signal-to-noise ratio was way off and he left every female viewer not already familiar with his shtick convinced that he was a smirking sexist turd. MacFarlanes animated series ""Family Guy"" did not suffer from that problem I guess because if you watched 10 minutes of that show you either got it and laughed along or decided to watch something else indeed anything else - a county board meeting on public access your terrier refusing to stop gnawing that mangy spot - and never went back.So we return to the fact that MacFarlane has now made two films about Mark Wahlberg and a talking teddy bear (voiced of course by MacFarlane himself) and that they both involve failed sexual-stalker attacks on Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. (Oh and yes DeflateGate comes up Dressed as an A/C repairman John gushes ""I dont think youre a cheater. I think your balls are perfect."") Well you cant say that the homoerotic subtext of the ""Ted"" movies is concealed or is even subtext. Cheerful dim John with his lower-management haircut and his borderline Dad jeans is one of Wahlbergs more appealing characters and if ""Ted 2"" comes nowhere near the cheerful insanity of the first ""Ted"" it starts with a premise that could have been the basis for genius subversive satire if werent just another throwaway MacFarlane container. Ted has gotten married to his downscale Boston sweetheart Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) who doesnt mind his lack of a penis because the guys who come attached to those are generally such jerks. Gender revolutionary But when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts decides that Ted cant get married because hes not a human being and if hes not a human being he must be an item of property well we have a groundbreaking civil-rights case. One that is not without precedent in American jurisprudence as an African-American co-worker of Teds points out. This case likely to change history gets assigned to 26-year-old stoner Sam even though shes a brand new lawyer because well because we need Amanda Seyfried in the movie to make googly Gollum eyes at John. Sam knows about the Dred Scott decision but does not know who Clubber Lang or Apollo Creed are or why it doesnt make sense for Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader to be walking down the street together. She will become enlightened on those topics and others besides in an intermittently amusing movie that could almost have decided to become a deranged commentary on the state of contemporary America but just turns over the jizz-rack instead.

Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday June 25 2015 Follow AnnHornaday As a rude crude slapdash one-liner the boy-and-his-toy comedy ""Ted"" was the surprise hit of 2012 earning more than half a billion dollars most of it abroad and proving that all a movie needs is a vulgar talking Teddy bear weed jokes and some naughty sight gags to teach the world to laugh if not sing in perfect harmony. With ""Ted 2"" director and co-writer Seth MacFarlane -- who also voices the Boston-accented profanity-spewing plushie of the title -- tries to re-bottle that lightning making a halfhearted bid for humanistic respectability in the bargain. As ""Ted 2"" opens Ted is marrying his sweetie from the first film Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). One year later theyre bickering about bills and throwing epithets at each other. Advised that a baby would cure all their marital woes Ted and Tami-Lynn decide to expand their family an adventure that stops short when theyre informed that in the eyes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Ted is not legally a person but property. [The 2015 Summer Movie Guide] As with the first movie the novelty of ""Ted 2"" lies in the hostile puerile graphically gross verbiage that spews out of the mouth of the otherwise cuddly protagonist as well as the copious amounts of dope that flow into it. And as in the first movie those novelties fade quickly. What are clearly manufactured to be the movies most memorable set pieces -- a scene at a sperm bank where Ted and his human friend John (Mark Wahlberg) run gloppily amok; a random rendition of the ""Law amp; Order"" theme song they sing together while doing bong hits on Johns couch; and a sequence where a stoned Ted drives a car into a barn on a pot farm -- are executed with more of a sense of duty than genuine antic inspiration. As he proved with his misbegotten ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" MacFarlane is essentially a guy whos gotten appallingly lucky on television. He exhibits zero proficiency in cinematic staging and no sense of pace. The coarseness and monotony of politically incorrect jokes wear the viewer down. At one point Ted goes to an improv comedy club to yell out such tasteless prompts as ""9/11"" ""Robin Williams"" and ""Charlie Hebdo."" Yet moments of disarming sweetness sneak through. ""Ted 2"" begins with a smashing opening musical number that recalls Busby Berkeley and Amanda Seyfried -- who plays a young attorney helping Ted in his quest for justice -- sings a lovely original song MacFarlane wrote for the film during which creatures from the animal kingdom harken to her voice in Disney-fied adoration. ""Ted 2"" the sequel to Seth MacFarlanes 2012 film ""Ted"" stars MacFarlane as the title character along with Mark Wahlberg and Amanda Seyfried. The film is scheduled to be released on June 26. (Universal Pictures) As ever Wahlberg nails his portrayal of a man-child whos still devoted to his best ""thunder buddy"" and the throwaway lines he delivers with utter sincerity -- about everything from Tom Bradys manhood to ""Beetlejuice"" -- are among the films funniest. (Brady by the way delivers one of several cameos in ""Ted 2"" which reaches ""Entourage"" proportions. One scene in particular set in the store where Ted and Tami-Lynn work is a mini-showcase of deadpan lunacy.) Between wordy courtroom fights and a climactic donnybrook at the New York Comic Con great swaths of ""Ted 2"" sag into a punchy sluggishly overlong assemblage of stunts and calculated provocation. In setting Ted on a quest for recognition of his rights and his love for Tami-Lynn MacFarlane clearly means to address Americas freighted history with slavery as well as the issue of marriage equality. Despite this dubious bid for respectability the filmmaker doesnt come across as enlightened but rather as someone having his cake and greedily eating it too. It takes a particularly glib entitled form of chutzpah to invoke Dred Scott the 13th Amendment and the Emancipation Proclamation on behalf of a character beloved for spewing dim-witted epithets. Whether his intentions are innocent or ham-handedly cynical MacFarlane -- the man who gave us the song ""We Saw Your Boobs"" at the 2013 Oscars and who lards his film with running jokes about gay sex and the physical endowment of African American men -- has made ""Ted 2"" less a spirited defense of tolerance and equality than a facile only fitfully funny burlesque.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Prude alert ""Ted 2"" is profane socially incorrect pro-pot irreverent deliberately obnoxious and packed to the end credits with decadent jokes that are not legally quotable in most states. It mocks sacred cows like Robin Williams 9/11 and Charlie Hebdo. It is deliberately crass. Wisenheimer advice Dont miss this one its a riot. The follow-up to 2012s ""Ted"" one of my favorite anything-goes comedies of the decade extends the prankish original to new levels of cheesy genius. Mark Wahlberg returns as John who as a lonely Boston boy wished that his stuffed teddy bear would become his real best friend and got his request. Co-writer/director/vocal co-star Seth MacFarlane again plays the animated animal who entered adulthood less sensitive and adorable than he was in his cuddly youth. While the pair do remain buddies forever their connection has the kind of bong-fueled bro humor you hear when lowbrows get high. In this chapter John is divorced from Lori (Mila Kunis) whom he married at the end of the previous episode and a bit dejected by his return to solitude. Ted and his hottie blue-collar bride Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth who does very much with a very little role) face their own problems. Their efforts to have a child are rather tricky since Ted lacks a male appendage. Johns assistance sets off a downpour of bodily fluid jokes that range from an overflow at a local sperm clinic to burglarizing Patriots quarterback Tom Bradys bedroom. As before there are cool celebrity cameos throughout. Ultimately Teds quest for a child triggers a legal battle as the state of Massachusetts aims to revoke the plushy toys citizenship because he isnt a real person. A courtroom clash like a giddy lampoon of ""Law amp; Order"" finds Ted without his marriage rights employment and pizza delivery discount card. Watching a rebroadcast of ""Roots"" where LeVar Burtons slave character Kunta Kinte is introduced to life in the colonies with a whip Ted says ""See thats just like me"" Before you can say Plessy vs. Ferguson Brown vs. Board of Education or Dred Scott (and the film does) the issue that everyone should be treated equally becomes the main theme. Rachel Dolezal and Caitlyn Jenner dont show up in the mix maybe because they hit the headlines too late. In their place we have Amanda Seyfried as a new lawyer who takes on the case for free because it defends justice -- and Wahlberg is cute compared with most Boston losers. And yeah she likes cannabis too. Morgan Freeman mocks the wisdom-heavy parts he often plays as a lawyer who represents clients against racial discrimination. Universal Studios ""Ted"" (voice of Seth MacFarlane) in ""Ted 2."" This is MacFarlane balancing the films heavy use of tribal humor -- there is not a subset of society the film doesnt ridicule -- and its well-meaning heart. MacFarlane grabs every example of political censorship and progressive guilt it can find and sets them afire but at the same time offers positive representations of diverse groups. Whenever someone stereotypes others in the film its that idiot whos the butt of the gag. ""Ted 2"" doesnt walk on eggshells carefully it stomps them. Its reminding us that were all juggling problems and making fun of ourselves is a part of dealing with that. Dadaist absurdity like this is a rare gift in an era when ethnically offensive laughs are increasingly considered off limits. Yes at times it pushes its jet-black race-based sexist jokes a smidgen too far. Sure the plotting is stubbornly spotty and at times its gags are too tossed away to make the impression they deserve. OK at nearly two hours its a good 15 minutes overlong. But I wouldnt cut the countless left-turn subplots. Why lose that opening with a multimillion-dollar tribute to Busby Berkeley dance extravaganzas? Or stop Seyfried singing MacFarlanes fine new love song ""Mean ol Moon"" while woodland creatures from across the world drop by to listen? Or remove that battle royal at New Yorks Comic-Con that riffs off every science fiction movie of the last half century? It kept me happy until the last moment of the long end credits and if youre lucky itll do the same for you. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Updated July 29 2016  153 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Second Ted tickles the funny bone By Joe Williams / film critic / joewilliamspost-dispatch.com Joe Williams Jun 25 2015 (...) When it comes to writing reviews movies about dying are easy and comedies are hard. Because one mans mirth is another mans poison this critic can only consult his belly as the barometer. On a gut level ""Ted 2"" is a funny film.As in the previous installment writer and director Seth MacFarlane voices the title character a 2-foot-tall teddy bear who came alive after a young Bostonian named John Bennett made a wish. Three decades later John (Mark Wahlberg lovably dumb) is a divorced grown-up and Ted is his ageless alter-ego a foul-mouthed intoxicated tour guide through Neverland.Soon after Ted weds brassy bimbo Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) their interspecies marriage is in the doldrums. Ted suggests that they try to have a child together which would be difficult because he has no reproductive organs. When they attempt to adopt a baby the state of Massachusetts decrees that Ted is not a person and the marriage is annulled. To plead his case the only lawyer that Ted can afford is Samantha aka Sam L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) a recent graduate of Arizona State University. (One suspects that the many jabs against ASU are private jokes. This is a movie that will reward those with enhanced senses or freeze-fame capabilities as when the fine print in a newspaper article about the court case says supporters around the world are declaring ""Je suis Ted"")Like Ted and John Sam is an unrepentant pot smoker and a montage where they blaze a trail through a law library is a stoner spoof of ""Footloose."" Other funny scenes include a disruptive visit to an improv club a slapstick chase through a comic-book convention and a cameo by a particularly paranoid Liam Neeson. Theres even room for some sweetness here. A moonlight serenade for an audience of woodland creatures is reminiscent of a scene from ""Joe vs. the Volcano"" and thankfully its not punctuated with a fart joke. After a small handful of films MacFarlane still isnt much of a director but he is clearly fond of old-school musical interludes.Yet he also has a weakness for bodily-fluid gags and last-resort obscenity. For some audiences low-brow humor is the whole point of the ""Ted"" movies. And if a critic tries to make a big stink about it that objection is hereby overruled.What ""Ted 2""  Three stars out of four  Run time 151  Rating R  Content Crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug use Tags Seth Macfarlane Liam Neeson Ted 2 Mark Wahlberg Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

AndA Ted 2 for a good chunk of its first half manages to live up (down?) to the surreal grossness all that implies. Its a hell of a thing making a dirty movie about a teddy bear thats come to life; you can get away with all sorts of stuff ordinary movies cant. You can show a bunch of guys watching bears screwing on TV and have one of them yell in anguish ""Hey Thats someones daughter"" And you can make a lot of dick jokes -- I meanA a lotA of dick jokes -- because of course teddy bears dont have dicks. Ted 2 begins with Ted (voiced by writer-director Seth MacFarlane) the aforementioned talking hirsute toy marrying his girlfriend Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). Over images of the happy couple celebrating with friends and family a narrator informs us that the wedding proves two things ""One happy endings can come true for anyone and two America doesnt give a shit about anything."" A funny enough line sure but also an interesting one in the context of the rest of the film. Because Ted 2 surprisingly winds up becoming about America suddenly giving a shit -- and not always in a good way. But first more of the setup because thats easily the best part. Ted and Tami-Lynns marriage hits the rocks not long after their wedding (in a gritty handheld scene straight out of Raging Bull that MacFarlane plays straight to great comic effect -- again context is everything). To try to mend their relationship they decide to have a baby. Unfortunately Teds a teddy bear and unable to impregnate Tami-Lynn. Thus the aforementioned Brady Option and several other attempts by Ted and his best friend John (Wahlberg) to try to procure a donor. But it turns out that Tami-Lynn is also infertile due to her long history of drug abuse. When the couple tries to explore adoption the legal system starts to take notice of Ted Suddenly it turns out that in the eyes of the law he is still considered property. (No really.) To help defend him in his civil-rights case (no really) Ted enlists the services of a very high-powered and expensive lawyers young inexperienced and significantly less expensive niece Samantha (Amanda Seyfried). She brings up the Dred Scott case Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. Board of Education. (No really.) Ted is excited John is smitten and away we go. Its at this point that Ted 2 mostly goes off the rails. Its not so much that MacFarlane doesnt know what hes doing with respect to the films conscious evocation of civil rights It fits in with his nothing-sacred approach to comedy in which the laughs often come from the sheer transgressiveness of the gags. Theres no such thing as going too far Early on a sperm-bank mishap leaves John covered in a crate full of semen but a nurse instructs Ted and John not to worry; those were the ""rejected sickle-cell samples."" Ted immediately ribs his friend ""Youre covered in rejected black-guy sperm -- like Kim Kardashian"" Its not a funny joke; in fact its a pretty offensive one. But theres an oh-shit-he-went-there tension to it and thats what MacFarlanes going for. He couldnt care less if you laughed. He probably hopes youll sue. But as Ted 2 proceeds theres increasingly less there to the he-went-there. The film seems mostly content with the running and eventually tiresome gag of equating Teds ordeal with that of the civil-rights movement. At one point Ted watches a scene of Kunta Kinte being whipped on the mini-series RootsA and sighs ""Thats just like me."" Yes yes we get it your inner voice yells. Its supposed to be funny cause hes a bear. Move on. The problem isnt so much one of repetition or boundaries but rather purpose If you are going to repeat a joke this much you should probably have a point to make. But Im not sure MacFarlane does other than to make us admire his irreverence. The film opened with a narrator admonishing America for not giving a shit. So wait is Teds humanness supposed to be a good thing or a bad thing in the eyes of this movie? Look I realize that asking for consistency or a unified vision of the world from a dirty comedy about a foulmouthed teddy bear from Boston is a fools errand. And Ted 2 has enough decent laughs to keep things moving along. Theres an early bit with Liam Neeson anxiously buying a box of Trix thats very hard to explain but very very funny. Theres an out-of-nowhere bit where John and Ted go to an improv-comedy show and yell out sad suggestions. (""Can anyone suggest an event?"" ""9/11"") The whole movie is mostly just an excuse to toss around a bunch of random jokes and see what sticks. Many of them do. And were supposed to forget the jokes that dont and the halfhearted excuse for a story and the wink-wink echoes to the countrys dark past. The trouble is lazy opportunistic writing can be distracting in its own way and theres way too much of it in Ted 2 to fully ignore.

Universal Universal Ted 2    Director Seth MacFarlane Cast Mark Wahlberg Amanda Seyfried Rated R (crude and sexual content pervasive strong language drug use) Running time 115 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1154am on Thursday Jun. 25 2015 Thursday Jun. 25 2015 Thursday Jun. 25 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Who would have thought that the most topical and timely mainstream movie of the summer would be one with a trash-talkin teddy bear and his beery Boston bro best friend? And its a sequel no less -- from the often woeful Seth MacFarlane the guy who delivered one of last summers worst films A Million Ways to Die in the West.Yet the uneven and overly long Ted 2 dropping into theaters just as the topic of race dominates the national conversation and the Supreme Court is expected to make a ruling regarding gay marriage manages to find moments of uproarious if raunchy and groan-inducing humor from todays hot-button headlines. At its best its better than Ted 1.0 and its like a tonic against the parade of bad-news bears delivering the cable-TV news. At its worst its like well a Seth MacFarlane movie.In 2 Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) the teddy bear who came to life as the best bud to Mark Wahlbergs John in the first film has married his supermarket sweetheart Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). In fact the film opens with a wonderful re-creation of 30s-era movie musicals (choreographed by Broadways Rob Ashford) meant to evoke that sense of young wedded bliss.A year later its a different story. The magic has evaporated and Ted and Tami-Lynn are on the cusp of divorce. Meanwhile John is no longer with Lori (Mila Kunis in the first film) so these two guys are just a festival of sadness.Ted and Tami-Lynn figure having a child might help but Ted being a toy doesnt have reproductive capabilities so they at first try to get a superstar donor (New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady) and failing that a sperm bank. Of course the results for both are predictably disastrous.Then they try adoption but the process kicks into motion a legal action no one was prepared for the state deciding that Ted isnt human but is instead property with no rights.Not only is he forbidden to adopt but his marriage is annulled he loses his job and -- now that hes officially a ""thing"" with no recourse -- a toy company wants to steal him cut him up to find out what makes him tick and manufacture foul-mouthed bears for all of America. (This subplot revolving around Giovanni Ribisi as a super-nerdy janitor turned bear-napper is the least humorous part of the movie.)With the unspoken but implied motto of ""bears lives matter"" Ted and John decide to fight back hiring a fresh-from-school dope-smoking lawyer Sam (Amanda Seyfried) hoping to force the courts to recognize Teds humanity. The trouble is she has never handled a real case but she does have enthusiasm and a law degree. Game on.Riffing on everything from the Dred Scott decision to Roots F. Scott Fitzgerald to Billy Veras 80s Ramp;B song At This Moment -- and featuring cameos from Liam Neeson Morgan Freeman and Flash Gordons Sam Jones -- Ted 2 is too scattershot to be consistently funny.MacFarlane who also co-wrote this simply cant resist the most juvenile drug race sex and penis jokes -- though the running gag about Google searches almost makes it all worthwhile. Another running joke involving Patrick Warburton ( Seinfeld) and Michael Dorn ( Star Trek The Next Generation) as a cruel gay couple falls flat.And if youre resistant to MacFarlanes liberal politics then Ted 2 probably isnt for you.But when MacFarlane connects as in a send-up of Disney musicals with a song sung by Seyfried Ted 2 just might have you singing -- and laughing -- along.Out of the mouths of bears ...

(Photo courtesy Universal Pictures/TNS) Seth MacFarlane returns as the voice of the bawdy bear in ""Ted 2."" (Photo courtesy Universal Pictures/TNS) Photo Handout McClatchy-Tribune News Service Ted 2 -- lowdown and very funny 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Some people wont want to laugh at ""Ted 2"" and they might succeed if they fold their arms across their chest close their eyes and gag themselves. But they might laugh even then. Writer-director Seth MacFarlane is like some weird combination of a stupid dirty-minded teenager and a brilliant comic master. His impulses are sophomoric but he knows where to find the punch line and he hits it again and again. He has more going for him than audacity but he has plenty of that too. Are you ready for a Robin Williams joke? Are you ready for a 9/11 joke? How about a joke that combines Robin Williams and 9/11? ""Ted 2"" contains laughs about things that seem as if they just happened -- for example a scene with Patriots quarterback Tom Brady that references the deflated football scandal. Watching ""Ted 2"" is like being in the mental space of a comedy piranha ready to devour any red meat the second it appears. Very quickly it becomes fun just trying to figure out where MacFarlane will go. At one point Ted -- the teddy bear come to life voiced by MacFarlane -- and his best friend John (Mark Wahlberg) are in a room with sperm samples. There really is no reason for them to be there so clearly something funny has to happen. It does and on a grander cruder scale than you might guess. Oh yes and on three occasions the movie suggests that Amanda Seyfried who co-stars bears a resemblance to Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings."" Seyfried is a very good sport because if MacFarlane hadnt mentioned it nobody would have noticed. But the resemblance is enough that the audience catches the reference immediately. Throughout there are celebrity cameos all of which find their mark. Liam Neeson plays a version of the cautious paranoid character hes been playing in action movies and Jay Leno appears in a single shot thats a big laugh. The movie begins with the marriage of Ted and his girlfriend Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) and with its vivid language and drug allusions the movie earns its R rating within about three minutes. The sheer vulgar-mindedness of ""Ted 2"" is off-putting but only briefly until the movie wins over the audience with its fertility and inventiveness. There are just too many jokes not to laugh and they come from every direction. One of the first scenes for example is a marital spat between Ted and Tami-Lynn thats like a parody of real-life versions inflected by the absurdity of one of the participants being a teddy bear. This is probably a good place to mention that for all the vulgarity of MacFarlanes impulses he does not sexualize Ted lest the bear become a version of Chucky from the horror movies. Ted has no genitals and doesnt seem to miss them but it does mean that he and his wife may have to adopt. The story of ""Ted 2"" deals with Teds legal troubles -- that is his societal status as a bear that has come to life. Does he have full civil rights? The story is enough to hang the jokes on but not so much as to slow things down though if youre counting there are probably more laughs in the first half. Jokes aside there is something not only funny but winning in the way that Wahlberg plays his scenes with Ted. He buys into the fantasy completely and like the most simple openhearted soul imaginable talks to it/him like this is the most cherished friend in the world. That openheartedness helps ""Ted 2"" succeed -- and for almost two hours of running time. MacFarlane is cynical but hes not a cynic and there are moments in ""Ted 2"" where you can sense a longing for the gentler and more upbeat entertainment of an earlier generation. Just look at the opening credits which take place over a production number straight out of ""The Great Ziegfeld"" (1936). MacFarlane is doing it as a spoof but its too well done to be only a spoof. Theres some love there too. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com Twitter MickLaSalle Ted 2 Comedy.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a scene in Ted 2 that so perfectly encapsulates what people detest about Seth MacFarlane that youd swear he stuck it in there just to mess with the haters. In a darkened auditorium Boston lunkhead John (Mark Wahlberg) and his walking talking stuffed-animal friend Ted (MacFarlane) bombard an improv troupe with inappropriate suggestions. As the comedians nervously shrug off these touchy talking points--9/11 Ferguson Bill Cosby--a viewer cant help but feel as though theyve wandered into a pitch session at Fuzzy Door Productions. Who is MacFarlane after all but a class clown shouting jokes from the back row trying to crack up half his audience with referential humor and scandalize the other half with envelope-pushing irreverence?Its a funny thing to say about a movie with a foul-mouthed pot-smoking teddy bear but there actually were signs of a maturing sensibility in Ted MacFarlanes first foray into big-screen comedy. The film boasted plenty of the writer-directors famous (infamous?) cutaways those one-joke non sequiturs that remain Family Guys raison detre. But Ted also proved how much his particular comedic style benefits from the demands and limitations of live-action storytelling; if youre going to ask audiences to stay planted for two hours instead of 22 minutes you have to give them a little more to cling to than random acts of cruelty and pop-culture allusions. Ted 2 MacFarlanes third feature after the (somewhat unfairly) maligned Western spoof A Million Ways To Die In The West is less toxic than his small-screen work. Yet without the Apatovian arc of its predecessor it also feels a bit like a regression--especially given its typical sequel strategy of undoing the hard work of the previous film.One of the best gags in the first Ted was how everyone just kind of accepted the existence of the title character a toy brought to life through the power of a childs wish. (A couple decades after earning worldwide headlines he was basically treated like a washed-up celebrity.) The sequel flips that gag on its ear; after trying to adopt a child with his new wife Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) Ted finds his very personhood called into question the government attempting to revoke his basic liberties by reclassifying him as property. Thats right The creator of Family Guy and American Dad has made a crude civil-rights parable complete with fiery courtroom speeches about what it means to be human. Not that MacFarlanes newfound enlightenment conflicts much with his affinity for racial humor; there are passing references to Frederick Douglass Roots sickle-cell anemia Tyler Perry movies and--in the films most persistent running gag--the unavoidability of black penises on the internet. Is the civil-rights angle only there to balance out the barrage of black jokes? Or are the jokes a way for MacFarlane to prove that he hasnt lost his edge? Either way Ted 2 strikes a sometimes-awkward balance between sincerity and cheap provocation. It also forgets that the real draw of the first film wasnt Ted himself but Wahlberg whose sweet-lug routine scored a lot of belly laughs. The actor has less to do this time around. His character is now divorced and its a genuine bummer to see MacFarlane treat his ex--wonderfully played by Mila Kunis in the original nowhere to be seen in the sequel--like a wet blanket who brought him down instead of the catalyst for a positive life change. The love interest slot has been filled by Amanda Seyfried cast here as Teds wide-eyed pothead lawyer. Shes a down-for-whatever dream girl straight out of the Farrelly brothers wheelhouse--though given her pop-culture illiteracy probably not really MacFarlanes type. (He sets an entire sequence at the New York Comic Con the ideal backdrop for a writer whose work often hinges on colliding one reference with another.)The comedy as expected is scattershot. There are lame cameos like a one-shot appearance by Jay Leno but also inspired ones like a priceless exchange with Liam Neeson. And while an early Breakfast Club spoof is lazy even by MacFarlane standards a Jurassic Park parody plays smarter tribute to Spielbergs blockbuster than anything in Jurassic World. An avowed musical-theater devotee the director also finds room for a little song and dance The Busby Berkeley-inspired opening credits are basically a live-action remake of Family Guys title sequence and MacFarlane later stops the movie cold with a time-suck of an acoustic lullaby. Whether this smattering of shtick has the desired effect will depend on ones tolerance for jizz jokes celebrity namedrops and frequently desperate attempts to shock or offend. But even the target demographic may feel as though theyre watching a rerun especially once Giovanni Ribisi shows up to act out his same villainous scheme from Ted. Theres nothing like an inevitable sequel to put a growth spurt in reverse.

Actually thats Seth ""The Man from Family Guy "" MacFarlane talking through the mouth of the CG-created teddy bear that turned the 2012 comedy bearing his name into a bonkers box-office behemoth. Writer/director/fuzzy-critter-vocalizer MacFarlane is Ted and Ted is its creators id off the leash. Theres no speed governor on the bears potty-powered motor mouth -- a mouth that will say just about anything for a laugh no matter how un-PC those things may be. Sex jokes and dope jokes are ""Teds"" stock in trade. Quite a few work hilariously well. A gag that has characters gawking in awe at a lush field of super marijuana in the manner of the moment when the dinos are first revealed in ""Jurassic Park"" complete with John Williams signature score is a hoot. Others like a gay bathroom sex joke featuring Jay Leno not so much. That ones a throwaway moment thats emblematic of MacFarlanes scattershot directorial style Throw everything at the wall and see what sticks comedically speaking. Many of the stickier moments revolve around Ted and his best buddy Johns (Mark Wahlberg) efforts to secure sperm so that Ted can father a child with his ex-druggie wife (Jessica Barth) and thereby save his cratering marriage. (Leading candidate for worst idea ever.) For a donor they choose Tom Brady because Ted and John Boston lads are big Patriots fans and well ... When the donor gambit comes a cropper Ted and wife seek to adopt a baby but that lands them in legal trouble because Ted is not a human being and therefore has no right to adopt. That precipitates a courtroom battle to which the pairs spunky dope-smoking young lawyer (Amanda Seyfried gamely participating in the rude goings-on) brings in the infamous 19th-century Dred Scott Supreme Court decision which decreed that African Americans could not be American citizens and the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery. Thats to make the point that depriving a talking teddy bear of legal personhood is akin to slavery. In the midst of comedy seriousness. The combination feels forced. A more disciplined and smarter director might have been able to successfully blend the two elements but crude dude MacFarlane hasnt the skill to bring it off.

Needless to say this sequel is every bit as irreverent as the dispiritingly profitable 2012 original with which Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane transitioned his brand to the big screen. Whether or not thats a good thing will vary on an individual basis but if youd like to watch Mark Wahlberg accidentally get drenched in human sperm youve come to the right place. Continuing the perversely sincere story about the friendship between a Boston bro named John (Mark Wahlberg) and his talking teddy bear (Seth MacFarlane) this installment begins with the hard-living stuffed animal getting married. Nobody bats an eye about the union until a year later when Ted and Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) begin to confront the unique logistics of a human woman having a baby with a penis-less stack of sentient cotton. But the real issue only comes into play when the couple applies for adoption which prompts the state of Massachusetts to strip the sentient doll of his personhood. Cue a prolonged legal battle that pits Teds newbie lawyer Samantha (Seyfried) against the prosecutions high-priced heavyweight (John Slattery) in a civil-rights case for the history books. Yes Ted 2 is a courtroom drama. Its also a Busby Berkeley musical a road-trip movie a rom-com and whatever else MacFarlanes famously digressive sense of humor wanted to accommodate. MacFarlane follows the jokes that flitter through his head like a distracted bloodhound abandoning plot in order to chase a punch line. But who else would stop a movie dead in its tracks to squeeze in a prolonged scene about Liam Neeson nervously buying a box of Trix cereal? MacFarlanes preference for quantity over quality results in a lot of dead air but the gags that land are howlers and all of its crudeness (and racism and sexism and homophobia etc.) the movie beats with a real heart.

And it did? And now 20 years later the two of them still sit around getting stoned cracking dirty jokes and basically wasting their lives? Yeah. I heard that one too. Sadly. But although youd think the original ""Ted"" had gotten all the gags to be gotten out of that setup - and youd be right - here comes ""Ted 2"" with Mark Wahlberg returning as the technically grown-up John and creator Seth MacFarlane once again voicing Ted. And its unbearable. Sure MacFarlane can write simple jokes as long as the f key on his laptop holds out. Some of them are even funny. But a lot of them dont pay off and most trod the same well-worn territory - potheads practical jokes politically-incorrect cliches. And when it comes to everything else that goes into a real screenplay - developing characters who change and deepen or even just creating incidents that lead logically into the next - MacFarlanes terminally clueless. The story picks up as Ted is getting ready to marry his prostitute girlfriend from the first film. Ah romance. But when they want to start a family and try to adopt - Teds lack of anatomical detail making other options impossible - the state turns him down for not being human. And its off to court to fight for Teds civil rights. Its hard to keep track of how many ways this goes wrong cinematically but lets try. First of all MacFarlane isnt just a shallow fratboy when it comes to writing about relationships - far worse he doesnt realize hes a shallow fratboy. The few times he disastrously tries to get serious he merely reveals himself as being comically out of touch. For example the film tells us gravely that Johns marriage broke up because his wife tried to change him. From what being a stain on the couch cushions? It also has Ted and his wife deciding to have a kid because theyre fighting all the time over money. Right because having a baby is suddenly going to make that go away. Even a comedy about a talking teddy bear needs to have a vague concept about how real people behave and the consequences of that behavior. MacFarlane doesnt know or doesnt care - and the story ends with Ted and John no wiser than they were at the beginning. Nor can MacFarlane even structure that story. A self-deluding song-and-dance man he not only starts the film with an elaborate tap number for Ted but then stops the movie halfway through so Amanda Seyfried can sing a love ballad. The idea of Ted being put on trial is so fake so unfunny so Capra-corny he does it twice. There are a few good jokes and one or two nice sequences - like Ted and Johns favorite pastime of going to an improv theater and yelling painfully unfunny suggestions at the comics. But little of the movie is shot or staged nicely - it has the flatly lit dully composed look of a 80s studio comedy - and Wahlberg and MacFarlane grow tiresome fast. Seyfrieds character meanwhile might as well be called Miss Wish Fulfillment - a pretty young lawyer who on their first meeting sprawls barefoot on her desk flipping her blonde hair out of her eyes and smoking dope. Most sequels are simple callous cash grabs but this one is particularly grisly. Wahlberg really -- after that awful ""Entourage"" movie youre giving us this? And MacFarlane - you know wed just about forgiven you for the Oscars. Just. And this is how you repay us? With a tapdancing teddy bear? Ted may indeed be more than a stuffed animal. But the guys who made ""Ted 2"" are a couple of dummies. Ratings note The film contains strong language gross humor sexual situations drug abuse and violence. Ted 2 (R) Universal (108 min.)

While MacFarlane clearly doesnt stage this bullying to get laughs presenting this arbitrary cruelty in a fairly neutral way there seems to be a little voice underneath that says ""Dont these losers sort of deserve it?"" This sequence doesnt display all-out malice but rather sucker-punch meanness smacking someone in the face when they least expect it. That tone is typical of MacFarlanes comedy; his tone is so slippery that the nastiness of his sensibility sometimes knocks you out before you can steel yourself against it. But if ""Ted 2"" contains any real surprises its that long stretches of whats supposed to be a ribald comedy are spent on a soapbox making Message Movie speeches. See Video Ted 2 New Red Band Trailer Spoofs Star Wars; Mark Wahlberg Just Wants to Go Home (Video) In the opening scene living toy Ted gets married to Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) after which he tells his bride at the reception ""Im going to go 50 Shades of Bear on you tonight."" But soon their marriage is on the rocks prompting the pair to try to have a baby to solidify their relationship. Ted lacking the necessary anatomy turns to his friend John (Mark Wahlberg) as a donor leading -- of course -- to a scene in which Wahlberg knocks over a shelf of samples and gets drenched in semen. After this sticky gross-out sequence things get very high-minded When Ted and Tami-Lynn try to adopt a baby our bear is told he has no rights as a human being and that the state considers him property. So Ted and John hire Samantha (Amanda Seyfried) a young lawyer who shares their passion for smoking pot to defend Ted in court as he tries to prove his rights. MacFarlane draws many comparisons between Teds legal plight and the plight of African-Americans under slavery and one comparison about the plight of gay people trying to win civil rights in this day and age. Though MacFarlane makes obsessive jokes about blacks and gays most of them are unexpected sharp and layered so that they dont merely prompt knee-jerk offense. Also Read Mark Wahlberg-Will Ferrell Comedy Daddys Home Gets Holiday Release Yet when it comes to women MacFarlane shows that he is not an equal opportunity offender. During one scene at a diner when Ted is talking about women making eyes at John Samantha asks what her eyes are like and Ted says ""You have Give me the ring my precious eyes."" This gets a laugh at Seyfrieds expense but its an uncomfortable one. Its like that moment in the Farrelly Brothers ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" (2000) where Jim Carrey tells Renee Zellweger that she has a face thats ""pursed up like you just sucked on a lemon."" This is the kind of joke that gets a laugh of recognition but its so heedlessly not-nice that the laugh really isnt worth it. Yet MacFarlane doesnt stop with that one mean line He makes an ongoing running gag of Gollum references for the rest of the movie. After the second one they begin to leave an extremely sour taste and you start noticing how often MacFarlane has set up his camera to ogle Tami-Lynns behind in her tight clothes. Also Read Amanda Seyfried Joins Daniel Radcliffe Dane Dehaan in Young Americans (Wahlberg meanwhile endures some gross-out and gay-panic humor here but he also has sexy young women throwing themselves at him all through the movie without irony. This obvious display of Wahlbergs power as a star is never questioned once by the supposedly relentless jokester MacFarlane himself a rich and powerful guy.) MacFarlane very clearly wants to be taken seriously as a progressive liberal for long stretches of ""Ted 2"" but maybe even this is just a cynical pose. There are some good laughs in this movie as opposed to the bad laughs the lame laughs and those non-laughs at Comic Con. (Liam Neeson is admittedly unexpectedly funny in a brief bit that sends up his gloomy image.) But bad taste needs to be more honest and more all-inclusive if its to make a lasting impression and MacFarlanes bad taste here is both too wishy-washy and too knee-jerk cruel to really make any impact.

"Ted 2 review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Ted 2 review More of the same bawdy bear Ted 2 HANDOUT Mark Wahlberg left and Seth MacFarlane (the voice of Ted) are joined by Amanda Seyfried in ""Ted 2."" Mark Wahlberg left and Seth MacFarlane (the voice of Ted) are joined by Amanda Seyfried in ""Ted 2."" (HANDOUT) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A sequel fully up to the hit-and-miss quality of the original. ""Ted 2"" reunites Mark Wahlbergs insecure wallflower character (its called acting folks) with the chubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff and racial sexual scatological and 80s-reference insults voiced with movie-saving acumen by co-writer and director Seth MacFarlane.""Saving"" is relative. Madly uneven more so than the mediocre 2012 hit that made half a billion worldwide this ones an easy predictive call. If you got your laughs out of ""Ted"" youll likely come crawling back for ""Ted 2."" Its not the same film but its same-adjacent. ""Ted"" was rated R for ""crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug use."" ""Ted 2"" on the other hand is rated R for ""crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug use"" though with MacFarlanes interest in keeping his lifelong pals forever in the vicinity of a nice big bong and a nonstop supply of weed ""some drug use"" is also relative.The sequel opens with an absurdly lavish musical credit sequence stealing from Fred Astaire and the Nicholas brothers set to Irving Berlins ""Steppin Out With My Baby."" (Broadway verteran Rob Ashford choreographed and beautifully.) Ted the magical talking teddy bear is celebrating his marriage to the woman he calls his ""Bawston hoor"" played by gum-chewing Jessica Barth. John played by Wahlberg married Mila Kunis blandly tolerant female lead in the first ""Ted"" but that union has been severed and Johns alone and depressed and addicted to porn. What a lovable loser Until you start dwelling on that particular detail; then he becomes something less cuddly. Teds marriage to his fellow grocery store cashier sours as well until the genital-free plush toy and his bride decide to have a baby. With full sincerity ""Ted 2"" believes in Teds own line with a kid in an unhappy home ""itll teach us to love each other again."" Works every time.The serious bits in ""Ted 2"" relate to Ted being revoked of his basic civil rights his personhood when the courts declare him to be property not human. Parallels to Dred Scott the legacy of slavery and Americas history of prejudice and intolerance are made throughout the film sometimes effectively sometimes in ways where you think Huh? Wha? Teds marriage is annulled; he loses his job. Its up to a fledgling lawyer (Amanda Seyfried introduced lighting up a bong) to right the wrongs and reawaken Johns lust for life. Ted 2 HANDOUT Ted (voice of Seth MacFarlane) and John (Mark Wahlberg) prepare to go scuba diving in ""Ted 2."" Ted (voice of Seth MacFarlane) and John (Mark Wahlberg) prepare to go scuba diving in ""Ted 2."" (HANDOUT) I laughed three or four times mostly at verbal byplay since director MacFarlane struggles when it comes to timing filming and cutting sight gags many of them (including the accident at the fertility clinic) straight out of his cash cow ""Family Guy."" Theres a riff on F. Scott Fitzgerald that works mysteriously well. The Liam Neeson cameo does too. A lyric interlude featuring Seyfried singing an original tune (""Mean Ol Moon"") written by MacFarlane and composer Walter Murphy resurrects the old joke about woodland creatures cooing over the female protagonists musical charms When the lobster rolls up with the raccoon and the fawn its just stupid enough to click.The rest of the movie eh. What I said three years ago about the formula in ""Ted"" goes for ""Ted 2"" MacFarlanes career is built on ""a high quotient of startlingly crude ethnic and cultural stereotypes leavened by a sincere appreciation for American popular music of another era.""

(Universal Pictures via AP) ( ) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press on June 24 2015 at 1004 AM updated June 24 2015 at 1047 AM comments ""Ted 2"" a Universal Pictures release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug use."" Running time 115 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. By LINDSEY BAHR AP Film Writer ""Ted 2"" asks a question that we never needed or particularly wanted to know the answer to Is Ted the magical foul-mouthed pot-smoking teddy bear a person in the eyes of the law? While its unfair to judge a comedy simply for a ridiculous premise here it also happens to be the unlikely killer of the overstuffed ""Ted 2."" And resolution does not come quickly enough in this nearly two-hour rumination on civil rights and abject stupidity. Part of the charm of ""Ted"" writer-director Seth MacFarlanes better-than-it-should-have-been story of a grown man and his sentient stuffed animal was how unaffectedly it treated its talking teddy. Ted just is. No one thinks too hard about the why of it. Combining that silly foundation with Mark Wahlbergs endearingly dopey intensity was a stroke of brilliance. The movie was allowed to only be about their friendship and it worked. Making a sequel to an original comedy is always a tough game though. More often than not the desire to please fans and recreate the magic of the first produces nothing more than an exaggerated rehash. In an admirable effort to go a different route MacFarlane has instead done something hopelessly bizarre Hes given his film too much sincerity and story and it practically crushes whatever fun does exist. This time we meet up with Ted (voiced again by MacFarlane) at his wedding to fellow grocery store clerk and gum-smacking bombshell Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). Their newlywed bliss soon curdles and they decide to have a baby to save the marriage. Because the natural way of going about this business is not an option (for a few reasons) Tami-Lynn and Ted decide to try adoption. Its then that a state authority asks whether or not a stuffed animal should be afforded the rights of a human. And very quickly after that Ted loses his job his marriage is invalidated and audiences are forced to endure a horrifying thing a whiny self-righteous Ted. So best friend John (Wahlberg) now a sad-sack divorcee and Ted hook up with Samantha Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) a newbie law associate whos willing to take their case pro bono and a few montages later theyre off fighting the good fight in excruciating detail. Seriously there are almost interesting debates over Teds humanity and a few fairly earnest references to the 13th Amendment and Dred Scott. Its a wonder ""Ted 2"" didnt venture into artificial intelligence territory. Still its very rare for a MacFarlane venture to be completely unfunny. Even ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" had moments. The highlights in ""Ted 2"" are almost worth it. Theres a Busby Berkeley-style opening number a fantastic Liam Neeson cameo a riff on what the F stands for in F. Scott Fitzgerald a ""Jurassic Park"" bit and a few others. Theres even an over-the-top fight at New York Comic-Con (with more than a few ""Transformers"" peppering in the background though its unclear whether thats poking fun at Wahlbergs association with the franchise or promoting it).The sequence had some promise in spite of the vitriol fueling the joke but its all too late. MacFarlane continues to be a unique and probably misunderstood artist in popular culture. His venomous humor basic moral code crass sensibilities and fondness for classic showmanship are at the very least an interesting combination for a modern entertainer. But they havent quite meshed yet at least on film. The misadventures of a couple of crass knuckleheads should be simple fun and its quite all right to try for a more substantive story in something so trivial. But the silliness of the first has ceded to something thats also a little more hateful and bitter. Ted and John shouldve stayed on the couch and out of the courtroom.

"Review Ted 2 will make you laugh and cringe - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Ted 2 will make you laugh and cringeBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 06/24/2015 122406 PM PDTUpdated 06/24/2015 053528 PM PDT Related StoriesJun 24Ted 2 Where Seth MacFarlanes Ted ranks among talking bearsI didnt want to laugh. I swear.But I did laugh at ""Ted 2."" A lot. I also cringed squirmed and covered my eyes a couple times. But I laughed -- repeatedly. And thats what Seth MacFarlane wanted me to do.Damn him.The laughter came from the 15-year-old boy that still resides somewhere in this 47-year-old body. Which is why I was probably as glad as everyone else in the theater that the darkness hid my identity. Because they laughed too.""Ted 2"" is of course the sequel to 2012s ""Ted"" which focused on John (Mark Wahlberg) a Boston resident whose childhood wish brought his teddy bear (voiced by MacFarlane) to life. Now as adults the pair are foul-mouthed non-PC porn-loving pot-smoking best friends. Amanda Seyfried as Samantha Jackson Mark Wahlberg as John Bennett and Ted voiced by Seth MacFarlane in Ted 2. (Iloura/Universal Studios) ( Iloura/Universal Studios ) In the sequel Ted gets married and has to go to court to prove hes human enough to adopt a baby (after trying to steal Tom Bradys sperm) with his equally foul-mouthed sassy and gorgeous wife Tami-Lynn (a surprisingly good Jessica Barth). Amanda Seyfried plays Samantha their lawyer who ends up being nearly as bad as the boys in what looks like the most enjoyable role of her career.The plot means to play off the irony of a stuffed bear trying to prove hes human. But like in the original the story takes a back seat to the ridiculousness. There are a couple of subplots. The more successful one centers on the now-divorced John showing some heart while being gun-shy about relationships. The one that doesnt pay off involves an evil toy company trying to use Ted for its own greedy ends which does nothing more than set up MacFarlane to make fun of Comic-Con. Advertisement Perhaps to establish credibility with viewers who dont find jokes about black mens manhood funny MacFarlane enlists Morgan Freeman to play a famous civil rights attorney who is courted by Ted and Tami-Lynn when their case hits a snag. Freemans deadpan persona brings some of the movies best moments and it allows MacFarlane to show that he can write intelligent dialogue when he puts his mind to it. Whether he should be able to get away with dressing a civil rights statement in a bear suit even as he repeatedly makes race jokes is in the eyes of the beholder. MacFarlane is nothing if not divisive. Either you think his humor is racist sexist homophobic crude and not funny; or its hilarious harmless and refreshingly un-PC -- the equivalent of a roomful of guys -- admittedly probably white guys -- uttering jokes theyd never tell in front of their wives. MacFarlane actually manages to cram jokes about 9/11 police violence and Bill Cosby into one short scene.Unlike MacFarlanes last effort the awful ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" ""Ted 2"" is funny without being overly mean-spirited. Thats not to say its not repugnant and tiresome at times. Body fluid comedy only goes so far (as in not very); the same goes with cursing for the sake of cursing. There are times when ""Ted 2"" merely celebrates stupidity without irony. But just when the beating-up-nerds and anatomy jokes get old along comes the greatest and funniest geek fight scene ever filmed and then John plays perhaps humanitys cruelest joke ever on Ted leaving them high-fiving with glee as Samantha looks on mouth agape at their idiocy. (I laughed because I recognized the look and many men will have the same reaction.)The first ""Ted"" was a surprise hit. ""Ted 2"" wont surprise anyone. But it is funnier than the original and MacFarlane likely has scored another box office hit by making people laugh at things they might feel weird about laughing at.Damn him.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.Ted 2   1/2Rating R (crude sexual content pervasive language some drug use) Cast Mark Wahlberg Seth MacFarlane Amanda Seyfried Morgan Freeman Jessica BarthDirector Seth MacFarlaneRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesbear talkThe sarcastic and furry protagonist in ""Ted 2"" seemingly has an endless bag of one-liners.

One hilarious scene will kill terrible suggestion-based shortform improv comedy dead so thank you Seth MacFarlane.Its also detestable even as its charming and ingratiating. The laughs come so often that its easy to overlook that this is a bizarre self-pitying reversal of the white-savior genre Here whiteness is victimized. Ted 2 is a tale of oppression. That racist transphobic homophobic monster Ted has to go to court to win his civil rights -- with a case based on Dred Scott the Thirteenth Amendment and how Americans are always slow to grant equal protection to minority populations. In the end hes only successful when he convinces a famous black lawyer -- played by Morgan Freeman -- that hes a good enough guy to defend. Ted doesnt do that by changing -- being suddenly not a monster. He does it by having Pure Love for that best friend of his played by Mark Wahlberg.Film DetailsCritics Pick Ted 2 RatingR GenreComedy Running Time108 min. More Info Trailer Ted compares the annulment of his marriage to the injustices suffered by ""the fags -- I mean the homos"" He corrects his language since hes in court at that moment but never his heart. The film like MacFarlane himself desperately wants two things that should be incompatible to be the rudest filthiest most un-PC thing society will allow yet also to be embraced and celebrated as good and sweet and decent.All throughout I wondered How could people smart enough to craft the movies many funny scenes have signed off on a story that is overall so poisonous? (Theres never much indication that the movie is satirizing its lead bears understanding of what his minority status means. And I should point out that our chief critic the great Stephanie Zacharek in our official review acknowledges that the film may be indefensible but persuasively argues for its vitality and hilariousness. Also yes I know if you dont want to get mad at Seth MacFarlane dont watch Seth MacFarlanes movies and shows. I know. I wanted to skip this one but it didnt work out.)First lets establish how nasty this stuff gets. Wahlberg at one point crashes into a shelfful of samples at the sperm bank. Hes covered in the stuff and the moments a well-orchestrated gross-out laugh much better handled than the half-assed outrages of A Million Ways to Die in the West. But then a worker at the clinic tells him that theyre not in trouble -- that those are rejected samples that tested possible for sickle-cell.Related StoriesLets Hear It for the Indefensible Laugh and Laugh With Seth MacFarlanes Ted 2Voice Film Club Ted 2 and Inside OutTed yells ""Youre covered in rejected black sperm Like a Kardashian""First off how is Kanye West a reject? Second the idea that black sperm is more disgusting than white sperm is baked into the joke although Im sure the writers would contest this. Third MacFarlanes shock humor often depends on people we know are ignoble idiots saying things the rest of us know to be reprehensible -- that were laughing at these small-minded Boston chowderheads. But were not asked to laugh at the characters reprehensibility. No the joke is the joke -- its comedy writers idea of whats funny not comedy writers idea of what Boston bros think is funny.That gag follows a dispiritingly transphobic one of the sort MacFarlane has often been called out for. In fact he has expressed love and support for the transgender community in recent weeks. Asked about a series of gay-bashing Bruce Jenner jokes on Family Guy MacFarlane said ""My philosophy is live and let live and if something makes someone happy and theyre able to do it -- as long as it isnt hurting anybody -- live and let live.""So why keep the moment in Ted 2 where Ted disgusted to see that his pal John (Wahlberg) has some sort of gender-bending porn on his laptop actually shouts ""Chicks with dicks? There are no chicks with dicks Its just guys with tits"" Thats followed by an extended set piece where Ted instructs that the only way to be sure that this particular pornography doesnt come back to haunt John is to bash the laptop into pieces and then sink the remains in Boston Harbor. Live and let live MacFarlane is saying in essence ""Its hilarious that your lives are the most disgusting thing most Americans could possibly imagine but dont be thin-skinned or anything -- Im a good guy""Then theres the black characters. Cocoa Brown plays a supermarket cashier who is friendly with Ted and offers him terrible advice -- and with ferocious random hostility points out white customers and calls them the one slur that the dumbest white people you know complain that they cant say. Theres no logic to it and no point really Its just that the films one black woman is angry and incomprehensible and a little scary to Ted.As for its black men? Ted testifies in court that he is a person not a toy and therefore is due the rights enshrined in the Constitution. On the stand Ted is asked if he has a soul; he responds by singing ""At This Moment"" an ramp;b hit from the mid-Eighties. The judge a black man leans in and gives Ted a smooth high-five.So for Ted the whitest bear since Snuggles black women are a source of bewildered discomfort and black men are there to grant the award of coolness. Croon a white soul ballad most famous for appearing in a Family Ties? Man who cares if you think black sperm is lesser -- youre down.The plot mirrors in many ways the worries of white people who feel theyre becoming the minority in their own country. Heres Ted a pothead Southie lout having to prove to the state that he deserves to be treated as a full citizen that his marriage shouldnt be annulled just because he doesnt fit the commonly accepted idea of personhood. In the end of course the sage lawyer played by Freeman endorses Ted to a jury but only after first refusing. Ted isnt likable enough to defend the lawyer insists at first. But then hes moved by Teds love of John.Freeman the voice of American promise and decency doesnt get to be funny in Ted 2 -- hes the movies problem-solving hand-of-god but also its character witness there to let us know that its not the job of the Teds of the world to grow or change or stop joking that sex with black men is the ultimate debasement. No its Teds job to wait around until everyone else decides to love him whether or not he affords them their full humanity.Theres a dozen big laughs in this movie that scene at the improv show; a cameo from a great tough-guy movie star; a montage of forest critters; a great payoff to a joke about Amanda Seyfrieds raw and protuberant eyes; an inspired re-appropriation of John Williamss cheesiest score. But lord the scene where Teds feelings get hurt when his pals dont laugh at his joke about the phrase ""un-dick bong"" sounding like the name of the president of South Korea? MacFarlane and his writers write the scene so that the joke bombs within the actual world of Ted 2 so that even these chowderheads dont think its funny -- dude if you have to do that much work to make dumb punning assholery justifiable why not just come up with something that actually funny instead?

Seth MacFarlane brings back his foulmouthed dope-smoking teddy bear who must prove in court that hes a person not property. Mark Wahlberg returns as his friend. More of the same.Married life is not so great for Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) and Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) in ""Ted 2."" Maybe having a child would fix all that.(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 2 stars (out of 5)Ted the living teddy bear must fight to prove he is a person and not propertyThis remains a one-note joke now watered down even furtherSeth MacFarlane telegraphs his jokes.At least he does in ""Ted 2"" the sequel to his 2012 film about a teddy bear that comes to life -- and becomes the foulmouthed best friend of the now-grown kid who wished him alive. At the beginning of the second film a voice-over tells us that Ted is now getting married (to a woman) and that this means two things There are happy endings and ""America doesnt give a (expletive) about anything.""Then MacFarlane spends a couple of hours proving it.A lot of people liked ""Ted"" in which Mark Wahlberg played John Teds friend. (MacFarlane who directed and co-wrote the film provides the voice for Ted.)I was not a fan.RELATED Arizona State University the butt of Ted 2 jokesI didnt hate the film like I hate ""Family Guy"" one of MacFarlanes animated TV shows. It was just a one-note joke that wore thin over the course of a film. And now theres an entire second movie to further water it down.The film like most of MacFarlanes work is a mix of occasional laugh-out-loud moments -- there are some here -- and cringe-worthy misfires that play a lot more tone-deaf than he seems to intend.Maybe its just me for instance but this exact moment in history may not be the best time for a movie that argues for the civil rights of a dope-smoking profane teddy bear come to life.OK MacFarlane couldnt have known about the timing when he was making the movie but honestly would this ever have been funny? (And please dont tell me Im a prude. I love raunchy humor -- when its funny.)But were getting ahead of things. As the narrator says Ted marries a woman Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) who we met in the first film. Despite a happy wedding and a Busby Berkeley-like dance number over the opening credits however married life is not the dream come true the couple hoped for.Meanwhile John has gotten divorced (no Mila Kunis in this film alas) and is gun-shy about dating. Life is a bit of a mess for John and Ted until one of Teds co-workers at the supermarket where he and Tami-Lynn are clerks hits upon an idea Have a baby and your marriage will be saved.That this is horrible advice is a given and maybe part of the joke. Whatever the case Ted and Tami-Lynns efforts to procreate result in the discovery of a little-known law in Massachusetts where the film takes place Ted is not considered a person but property.AZCENTRALTed 2 (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsIt says something about MacFarlanes considerable intelligence that the Dred Scott Decision will come up during the movie. It says something about MacFarlanes taste that it will be inappropriate and uncomfortable. It says something about you whether you think its funny.John and Ted find a lawyer Samantha (Amanda Seyfried) who helps them sue the state to declare Ted a person not property. Much of the film is spent in preparation for the trial which involves a surprising amount of bong hits for such a landmark case. (And yet Johns reaction to Samanthas potent marijuana is actually one of the funnier bits.)A subplot that brings back Giovanni Ribisis deranged character from the first movie is a non-starter which eventually drives far too much of the story.There are some funny cameos and a couple of smart ones which I wont spoil (even if the trailers will) and Seyfried proves an incredibly good sport about her characters supposed resemblance to a certain resident of Middle Earth. Dennis Haysbert playing a doctor has the funniest line in the movie but youll have to listen closely for it. Its a throwaway totally clean all the funnier for MacFarlane not overselling it.Thats the thing MacFarlane preaches to the choir as much as a conservative radio talk-show host. His films and shows are an exercise in giving people exactly what they want. He doesnt offend his audience because it wants to be offended to see things taken as far as they can go. To his fans thats enough.To anyone else as ""Ted 2"" illustrates it isnt.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

For Ted the foul-mouthed stuffed animal and star of the surprise 2012 hit that moment has arrived. PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes Actually . . .that moment arrived about two-thirds of the way through the original (and admittedly laugh-out-loud) comedy when Ted was kidnapped by an abusive dad and got the stuffing knocked out of him at Fenway Park. Ha. This unnecessary and tedious sequel is an extension of that unfocused narrative. Except now as Ted (voiced by director and cowriter Seth MacFarlane) and his dim-witted thunder buddy for life John (Mark Wahlberg) embark on a new adventure of pot celeb cameos pot gross outs and pot it plays out like a smug game of ""lets see how we can fill two hours while we cash these ginormous paychecks."" And were the losers. PHOTOS Stars rewear iconic costumes Try to follow along Ted marries a blonde bimbo. Ted and the blonde bimbo argue. Ted and the blonde bimbo decide to have a kid to save the marriage. But Ted and the blonde bimbo cant have kids. So Ted and John try to find a sperm donor. Then Ted and the blonde bimbo try to adopt. But Ted cant adopt because hes classified as a ""property"" in Massachusetts. Ted wants his civil rights and hes willing to legally fight for it. Meanwhile creepy kidnapper Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) now a janitor at Hasbro hatches another plan to call Ted his own. Thats Act 1. Mila Kunis who gamely played Wahlbergs patient fiancee during the first go-round wisely bowed out of the sequel. Enter new love interest Sam Jackson (get it?) played by Amanda Seyfried a doe-eyed lawyer hired to take on Teds case. She takes hits from a bong in her office because of her headaches and gets razzed from the guys because shes pop-culture illiterate. Ted makes two jokes about her resemblance to Gollum from Lord of the Rings. PHOTOS Celebs whove lost or gained weight for roles What that pop culture reference doesnt make you smile? Fear not about 300 more are on deck. And while some of them hit (especially the Jurassic Park and Planes Trains and Automobiles homages) the majority of them are mean-spirited superfluous misses. The same goes for the celebrity cameos which serve no purpose other than for MacFarlane to show off his famous friends (Jay Leno) and former coworkers (Liam Neeson). Even the heralded Tom Brady appearance disappoints Hes a good sport about Deflate-gate and letting Ted and John gaze lovingly at manhood in his bedroom but wheres Gisele Bundchen? Everyone knows this guy doesnt sleep alone. True to form MacFarlane also tries to shock his audience by throwing a slew of crass un-PC jokes at the screen -- think racial slurs and homosexuality gags and 9/11 punchlines. Hearing an adorable toy spew vitriol was shocking once upon a time; now theres a palpable desperation to the button-pushing. In 2015 theres no need to include an easy-target (and filthy) joke about the skin color of the men who hook up with the Kardashians. PHOTOS Celebrity bromances All of the flicks deleted scenes apparently made the cut too. One throwaway in which Ted and John go to a comedy club and yell out insensitive material (Charlie Hebdo Germanwings etc.) has zero to do with anything Its as if MacFarlane tossed it in just to amuse himself. The self-indulgence extends to the out-of-place tap-dancing sequence during the opening credits and in the running time itself. Six times he could have ended the movie but it just keeps on going and going and going . . . Oops thats the wrong annoying stuffed animal. MacFarlane however does pull off one true jaw-dropper As Seyfried stands up in court to plead Teds case she earnestly compares his injustice to that of. . . 19th century slavery. Hello this is a teddy bear. Ted might be able to watch Law amp; Order reruns while lighting up but hes still a bear that squeaks if you press his belly. Equating his plight and the usage of the word ""property"" to one of the most heart-wrenching chapters in American history is appalling. At best.

Even though were all familiar with the films one-joke premise by now--the raunchy bromantic adventures of an affably underachieving Boston chowderhead (Mark Wahlberg) and his childhood pal an adorable stuffed bear come to foulmouthed life (voiced by MacFarlane)--the sequel still manages to walk the tightrope between clever and crass. For a while at least. Then after the 10th or 11th semen gag crass wins out leaving clever in the dust. Thats when you realize what it must be like to be trapped in detention with a bunch of 15-year-old boys who think theres nothing more hilarious than repeating the same jokes about porn pot and pulling your pud over and over again. Its funny until its not. Picking up shortly after the first film left off Wahlbergs John is in the dumps after breaking up with his wife (played by Mila Kunis in the first film) while Ted has tied the knot with Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) a gum-snapping townie who works in the same supermarket. The couples honeymoon phase is over so they decide to save their marriage by having a kid. Problem is as lifelike as Ted seems hes still an anatomically incorrect plush toy. So he and his ""thundah buddy fa life"" John have to find a sperm donor leading to sticky encounters with Flash Gordon himself (Sam J. Jones) and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. After failing to procure celebrity seed Ted and Tami-Lynn move on to adoption. But it turns out that the state refuses to recognize Ted as a person and the film quickly downshifts into a civil rights crusade to prove that Teds more than just Johns property. He deserves rights. With Amanda Seyfried as their stoned counselor they take Teds case to court. Theres also a needless subplot about Giovanni Ribisi as a creepy janitor scheming with Hasbro to kidnap Ted to see what makes him tick. Plenty of decent movies have been built on flimsier narrative scaffolding than Ted 2s but MacFarlane and writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild are smarter than a lot of the material theyve come up with here. Sure some of their jokes are inspired (Liam Neeson stealthily buying a box of Trix cereal worried that its just for kids; a series of jabs at Seyfrieds Gollum-esque saucer eyes) but too many are just loutish and lazy and dont land. Of course not every comedy--even the proudly lowbrow ones--has to be a Mensa-level exercise in meta humor. But MacFarlane who takes such mischievous delight in thumbing his nose at the uptight guardians of political correctness that he almost seems to get off on turning himself into a target (most notably with his ""We saw your boobs"" 2013 Oscar-hosting gig) tends to be sharper than the inoffensively offensive gags he tosses off here. Which is a shame because hes just handing his detractors more ammo. At some point MacFarlane will probably have to give up his Did I say that? merry prankster routine and grow up a little. When that time comes I have no doubt hell nail it.

Teds wife Tami-Lynn McCafferty (Jessica Barth) wants kids so its up Ted to track down a sperm donor. BY Jacob Hall NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday June 24 2015 900 AM Title Ted 2 Film Info Bear-ly believable sequel featuring the same stars and alas the same material. Starring Mark Wahlberg Seth MacFarlane Amanda Seyfried Jessica Barth and Morgan Freeman. Director Seth MacFarlane (115 minutes). Rated R. Opens wide. The original ""Ted"" wrung its ridiculous concept bone dry but co-writer/director Seth MacFarlane is back in the foul-mouthed teddy bear business for the sequel. Once again you will believe that a talking CGI stuffed animal can be a racist hateful monster with no redeeming qualities ... but his greatest sin is that hes not funny. ""Ted 2"" finds that sentient childrens toy (still voiced by MacFarlane) embarking on a new set of misadventures most of them involving sex drugs and pop culture references to 1980s movies. That ambling storyline begins with Ted teaming up with his buddy John (an agreeable Mark Wahlberg) to track down a sperm donor for his human wife. You can set your watch to the semen jokes. Eventually the real plot kicks into gear and Ted must prove that he is a person in a court of law so that he can be a father. Amanda Seyfried plays his young lawyer filling the position of ""thankless female co-star"" vacated by Mila Kunis. Other newcomers to the cast include Morgan Freeman who pops up to collect a quick paycheck. The bottom line The whole thing is stupid. Wahlberg returns as Teds lifelong friend and Thunder Buddy John Bennett. (Justin Lubin) THE WAHLBERG FAMILY INCLUDING DONNIE MARK AND PAUL IS BRINGING IS WAHLBURGERS CHAIN TO CONEY ISLAND A cute Busby Berkeley-inspired opening credits sequence suggests that MacFarlane would rather be doing anything else that his tired retread. Indeed ""Ted 2"" is jam-packed with familiar jokes. A swearing teddy bear is funny for about 90 minutes. The first film ran for 106; the sequel feels desperate from frame one. The jokes in ""Ted 2"" are stale repackaged leftovers. The film still finds any shot of its title character inhaling from a bong totally hilarious. There is nothing more amusing or terrifying than a penis. When the overly familiar third act rolls around even the most forgiving of audiences will realize that the screenplay is copying and pasting from the first entry. The movie leans heavily on celebrity cameos in place of actual laughs with a gonzo appearance from Liam Neeson earning the movies only real chuckle. MARK WAHLBERG JOINS NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK ON STAGE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN SHOW If ""Ted 2"" was funny clever or even sweet it would be easy to forgive its hateful main character. Any humanity has been ejected to make way for jokes at the expense of every minority in existence; this is a movie made by smug white guys for smug white guys. Theres nothing wrong with crude jokes but these barely qualify as jokes. This is bottom of the barrel finger-pointing. ""Ted 2"" is the equivalent of a middle school bully. Its not as funny as it thinks it is. Its penchant for casual cruelty masks a hollow soul. And it will be totally forgotten once we move onto bigger and better things. John and Ted find themselves in a beer emergency. Ted must legally prove that is a person so that he can be a father. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.

Not only is this a movie about a libidinous foul-mouthed stuffed bear; its the sequel to an earlier movie about a libidinous foul-mouthed stuffed bear. But I laughed and laughed at Ted 2 -- as I did at the 2012 Ted -- and I can hardly tell you what that says about me let alone about you. Will you laugh at Ted 2? That depends. The picture is somewhat ungainly. It putters along occasionally attempting to be about something bigger than itself and not really succeeding. But if youre in the right frame of mind and willing to give yourself over to its unapologetically idiotic id it has the power to shake something loose in you. We all claim to long for smart comedy but is it possible that puerile audacity is its own kind of intelligence? Or to put it another way this is your only chance this summer to watch Mark Wahlberg attempt to steal sperm from Tom Brady.Ted 2 like its predecessor was directed and co-written by Seth MacFarlane who also provides the voice of the bear known as Ted -- his diction has plenty of burly swagger straight out of Southie marked by those peculiarly elongated and flattened vowels that turn the thing most of us know as a ""car"" into a ""caah."" Ted 2 is not above turning human beings into caricatures; hell its all about turning human beings into caricatures poking fun as the first movie did at Boston lunkheads in particular. This time around though MacFarlane is going for something bigger In the opening scene Ted gets hitched to his lady love Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth); months later theres trouble in paradise and in a classic comedy setup ripped straight from the misguided motivations of real life the two decide that having a child will fix their marriage.Film DetailsCritics Pick Ted 2 RatingR GenreComedy Running Time108 min. More Info Trailer Forget that Ted doesnt have the necessary physical attributes to get his wife pregnant; it turns out that Tami-Lynn cant conceive anyway. When the two try to adopt the authorities decree that Ted isnt a human being but ""property."" MacFarlane treats Teds battle for personhood as a civil liberties issue analogous to gay-marriage rights Talking bears should be able to marry and have families too. EXPAND Related StoriesTed 2 Insists That Racist White Bros Are the Real Oppressed MinorityVoice Film Club Ted 2 and Inside OutThey should of course but luckily MacFarlane doesnt stretch that slender metaphor too thin. The gags mostly revolve around pot smoking and rampant joyful use of the F-word -- the latter flows from Teds CGId lips as freely and breezily as a scull skimming along the Charles. Meanwhile Teds human sidekick John (Wahlberg) mopes around -- his marriage to Mila Kuniss character from the first movie has ended in divorce -- but is revivified by the charms of the young lawyer who takes Teds case Amanda Seyfrieds Samantha. Unbeknownst to all the first films nefarious unbalanced villain Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) lurks in the shadows once again mounting an evil bearnapping scheme.Thats one plot point too many but it still doesnt dim the crude exuberance of MacFarlanes film which is after all just a delivery receptacle for raunchy jokes and cockeyed societal observations. As comedy masterminds go MacFarlane is a strange success story He amassed a healthy following with Family Guy and if Ted hadnt been such a huge hit there wouldnt be a Ted 2. But MacFarlane isnt walking on easy street Most critics hated his oddball western-comedy hybrid A Million Ways to Die in the West with its gonzo elliptical jokes. And many will never forgive him for the ""We Saw Your Boobs"" number at the 2013 Oscars obviously intended as a jab at the crass sixth-grade-level taste and inarticulateness of male moviegoers but instead interpreted as the most heinous example of it. MacFarlanes misfire elicited lots of wailing along the lines of ""Instead of celebrating the talent of these women hes insulting them by reducing them to body parts"" But face it Singing ""Hail women of Hollywood -- we recognize your vast accomplishments and we salute you"" just wouldnt have had the same ring to it. MacFarlanes ""Boobs"" number suggests that he knows exactly what the women of Hollywood are up against not that hes blind to it. Comedy needs to push boundaries -- how else can it get our attention? Even if MacFarlane sometimes pushes in what we perceive as the wrong direction do we really want him or anyone to stop?Ted 2 may not be sophisticated on its face but the mechanisms behind it are delicately calibrated.MacFarlanes comedy may not be sophisticated on its face but the mechanisms behind it are delicately calibrated. Teds desperate efforts to make a baby with Tami-Lynn dont begin with the attempted theft of Tom Bradys sperm. Brady is a fallback choice; Ted and John first try to get some from Sam Jones -- star of Mike Hodgess underappreciated space-glam extravaganza Flash Gordon which figured in Ted 1 -- but he refuses on the grounds that he has a sperm count of one. Yes one and hes hanging on to it ""Ill need it for protein if I ever get lost at sea.""You may not find that joke funny but you can probably at least see the multiple layers lurking behind it. The funniest things here arent even the crudest. When Ted John and Samantha try to get help from a hotshot lawyer played by Morgan Freeman Ted stares at him in trancelike silence adrift on his dulcet tones. When hes finally able to speak the words that slip out are ""I think I wanna sleep on a bed made of your voice."" Theres also a sight gag involving Teds discovery of and disgust at the amount of porn John has stashed on his computer. Its not enough to just erase it Ted tells his friend Theyll have to smash the hard drive and because not even that is enough to prevent recovery theyll need to bury the shards of the tainted laptop in Boston Harbor. The sequence lasts all of twenty seconds but it reaches a Looney Tunes level of ridiculousness. EXPAND We havent even gotten to the Liam Neeson cameo -- but you should see that for yourself. Ted 2 is bumpy and imperfect; MacFarlane has lots of ideas and he tries to squeeze too many of them in. But he does love musical numbers and he includes two charming and lively ones the first of which features Ted and a bevy of guy-and-gal Busby Berkeley-style dancers tapping away to Irving Berlins ""Steppin Out With My Baby."" Ted dressed in his wedding tux bounces along atop a row of top-hatted dancers touching down so lightly that he doesnt knock a single topper out of place -- you can do that when youre an animated bear. The number suggests the flip side to MacFarlanes love of coarse humor He likes a nicely cut suit a whisper-light soft-shoe an old song with a champagne kick. Maybe its time for him to retire the Ted concept and make a picture where he can put more of that sensibility to work. Ted movies may be like martinis and breasts -- threes too many but two is just right.Directed by Seth MacFarlane. Written by Seth MacFarlane Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild.

The magical teddy bear with the heart of gold and the mouth of potty is back in ""Ted 2"" and so is writer-director-star Seth MacFarlanes mischievous mojo which went missing somewhere in last years mirthless comic Western ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" A sequel to MacFarlanes surprise 2012 smash (549 million worldwide) ""Ted 2"" is surely the last movie one would expect to find quoting from the anthropologist Dawn Prince-Hughes writings on the essence of human consciousness. But in its own sweetly subversive way this might be just the tolerance plea America needs right now -- a movie that says in effect ""Love thy plushie as thyself."" Fret not Such high-mindedness has little diminished MacFarlanes appetite for locker-room humor gross-out sight gags and bounteous pop-culture in-jokes which should make ""Ted 2"" the seasons go-to attraction for arrested-adolescent males of all ages and continue Universals beary good summer box office. The last time we saw Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) hed been brought back from the brink of death and was serving as best man at the wedding of his lifelong ""thunder buddy"" John (Mark Wahlberg) and bride Lori (Mila Kunis). When the sequel picks up its Teds turn at the altar where he trades vows with brassy checkout girl Tami-Lynn (the terrific Jessica Barth whos like a trailer-park Judy Holliday) while returning guest star (and erstwhile Flash Gordon) Sam J. Jones once again serves as officiant. Its a fitting start for a movie that acknowledges its own inescapable sequel-ness at least as often as ""Jurassic World"" repeating some gags inverting others and lining up a new raft of ""I cant believe thats really ... "" celebrity cameos. Alas romantic bliss is not long for either of these Beantown couples. By the time Ted says ""I do"" John is already six months divorced from Lori (a convenient way of explaining the absent Kunis whose real-life pregnancy coincided with the shoot). One year after that Teds own once-happy home has become a kitchen-sink melodrama of tears and recriminations (including the amusing notion that Tami-Lynn has been blowing too much of the family budget on shopping sprees at Boston discount retailer Filenes Basement). The only way to save their relationship Ted reasons is for him and Tami-Lynn to have a child -- a plan that faces only one small hitch the fathers lack of anatomical correctness. That sets the stage for a delightfully crackpot artificial insemination scheme that sees Ted and John plotting to make off with the sperm of New England Patriots QB Tom Brady (gamely playing himself). But its only during a later meeting with an adoption counselor (slyly modeled on a similar scene from Michael Manns ""Thief"") that Ted discovers erectile dysfunction to be the least of his problems. The state of Massachusetts has determined that he is a piece of property not a person -- and before you can say Dred Scott Ted stands stripped of his identity his job and his marriage certificate. What remains intact is Teds sense of self and so ""Ted 2"" evolves (to use the term loosely) into a MacFarlanized courtroom drama in which man and anthropomorphic stuffed bear struggle to find common ground. Helping in that battle is eager young civil rights attorney Sam(antha) L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) a recent law-school grad who wins over her first clients by demonstrating that she knows her way around a bong. (Well that and the fact that her name is Sam L. Jackson.) As it turns out Jackson knows her way around a courtroom too just as Seyfried (who was one of the few bright spots in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"") cheerfully fields whatever new humiliation (including a running bit about her resemblance to Gollum) MacFarlane lobs her way. She brings a warmth and sweetness to the film that balances nicely against the bad-boy crudity and even croons a lovely original ballad ""Mean Ol Moon"" during a campfire scene set on (what else?) a marijuana farm. The trial scenes (featuring ""Mad Mens"" John Slattery for the prosecution) drag on a bit as does pretty much everything else in this 115-minute extravaganza suggesting that MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild dont always know their A material from their B material. Thats especially true of an expendable subplot that sees erstwhile stalker Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) now working as a janitor for Hasbro once again plotting to kidnap Ted and cut him open to see what makes him tick. In fact outside the two leads most of the returning cast are given precious little to do this time around including Jones and Patrick Warburton (as Wahlbergs gay bully co-worker). But the movie makes better use of new additions Morgan Freeman (parodying his saintly airs as a storied civil rights lawyer) and Liam Neeson (as a grocery shopper with some most unusual concerns about Trix cereal). Both ""Ted"" movies are ultimately one-joke affairs rooted in the idea of taking some emblem of childhood innocence and vulgarizing it (like Stewie the nefarious infant from MacFarlanes ""Family Guy"" series). That joke though turns out to be a resilient one and the chemistry between Wahlberg and MacFarlane is infectiously puerile whether theyre playing an ill-conceived game of catch in a sperm banks storage room or shouting out ""sad suggestions"" during a night of improv comedy. The visual effects responsible for transforming MacFarlanes on-set motion-capture performance into his 2-foot-tall alter ego have once again been seamlessly executed. Special mention is also due Tony-winning director-choreographer Rob Ashford for staging the films opening title sequence -- an elaborate Busby Berkeley-style dance number featuring a tuxedoed Ted and a chorus line of dancers in geometric configurations atop a giant wedding cake.

With Ted I didnt even laugh once. Wont be bothering with this one. McFarlane is pretty hit and miss but he does seem to understand his audience (thats 13-year-old boys...nobody over the age of 25 or with a college education...) Reply jhs39 says June 24 2015 at 1157 am The main problem with A Million Ways to Die in the West was the attempt to turn Seth MacFarlane into a live-action movie star-he just comes across like too much of a douche to be successful live rather than as a voice actor. Hopefully he wont try that again-Mel Brooks movies went down the crapper when he decided to make himself the lead rather than use real actors. Part of Gene Wilders deal with letting Mel Brooks direct his script for Young Frankenstein was that Mel Brooks couldnt appear in the movie because hes incapable of playing a part in character. Gene Wilder was right about Mel Brooks way before Brooks realized it and the same is true of Seth MacFarlane who was his own worst enemy in A Million Ways to Die in the West and his Oscar hosting stint where he came across as a too pleased with himself jerk. Reply joe b. says June 24 2015 at 1051 am Tell me Judith what is the highest form of comedy?

Reply Jeff says June 27 2015 at 1238 am Yet the movie itself is very good. Surprisingly deep and emotional for a movie about a foul-mouthed pot-smoking teddy bear with a ton of Hollywood in-jokes. Sure most the the humor is locker-room material but youre not getting anything else from a swearing pothead bear. One might as well blame the family dog because he doesnt play a good game of chess. Thats exactly the kind of humor you expect to get from Ted given his character and it delivers exactly whar is expected. That it delivers so much more is not expected and why the movie shines. If you liked the first one youll love this one even more. If you didnt youre in the wrong place anyway. Reply CTSadler says June 24 2015 at 213 pm Someone must have gotten her fee-fees hurt.

TWITTER Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg return for this sequel to the 2012 smash hit about a foul-mouthed teddy bear and his human best friend. One of the screenwriters of this sequel to Seth MacFarlanes 2012 smash hit Ted has joked that his suggestion for the title was Ted 2 More of Same. There was certainly no compelling reason to provide further adventures of the profane pot-smoking teddy bear and his human friend -- other than of course the originals 550 million worldwide box-office receipts. Delivering the same brand of anarchic vulgar humor Ted 2 should easily compensate Universal Pictures for the lackluster business of MacFarlanes ill-received A Million Ways to Die in the West. The sequel pretty much hews to the template of its predecessor with the same creative team and the return of most of the original cast members save for Mila Kunis. Set a few years later the story begins with Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) tying the knot with his sexy grocery store co-worker Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) as his best friend John (Mark Wahlberg) cheers them on. We soon learn that Johns marriage has ended and it isnt long before Teds begins to hit the rocks as well. In a desperate attempt to restore harmony Ted suggests to Tami-Lynn that they have a baby not an easy proposition since he was not exactly designed to be anatomically correct. Read More Minions Film Review The search for a sperm donor includes a nighttime raid on the mansion of Tom Brady (one of many celebrity cameos) with a reluctant John assigned to milk the football great while hes asleep. Needless to say the plan ends disastrously although it does provide the opportunity for a timely joke obviously added at the last minute about the quarterbacks balls. John volunteers to be the donor himself cueing a raucously funny scene set inside a sperm bank that will be familiar for those who have seen the movies trailer. But when Tami-Lynn turns out to be infertile the couple decides to adopt a child a process that leads to the state of Massachusetts stripping Ted of his identity since hes technically not a person but ""property."" So Ted and John enlist the services of a beautiful young lawyer Samantha (Amanda Seyfried) who despite her inexperience proves herself ideally suited for the job when she fires up a bong during their initial meeting. The ensuing court battle in which Samantha is pitted against an unbeaten hotshot attorney (John Slattery) ends badly leading to a road trip to New York City where the three hope to convince the countrys leading civil rights lawyer (Morgan Freeman comically riffing on his voice-of-authority persona) to handle the appeal.

Working as a janitor at teddy bear manufacturer Hasbro Donny persuades the head honcho (John Carroll Lynch) that if they can cut Ted open to see what makes him tick theyll make millions selling similarly animated bears. Although the originals over-the-top vulgarity has been dialed down a notch Ted 2 still offers plenty of R-rated laughs involving sex rampant pot smoking and profane language that will surely prove a challenge to network censors when the film is aired on television. Its also once again filled with endless pop culture references including elaborate sequences recalling such 80s-era films as The Breakfast Club and Planes Trains and Automobiles. The slew of cameo turns from celebrities who gamely make fun of themselves includes once again Sam Jones of Flash Gordon fame. The others identities wont be revealed here but an appearance by a certain action movie veteran with a stone-faced gravelly delivery is exploited to hilarious effect. The screenplay co-written by MacFarlane with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild gets bogged down by the serious plot turn with no less loaded a subject than the Supreme Courts Dred Scott decision frequently invoked. The courtroom melodramatics prove predictably tiresome and a lengthy set piece at New Yorks Comic-Con with its outlandish array of costumed geeks is the comedic equivalent of picking low-hanging fruit. Read More Vin Diesel Hints at Last Witch Hunter Sequel Teds Boston-accented zingers are expertly delivered by the director/star whose voice talent is undeniable and Wahlberg again demonstrates that hes skilled at comedy (no small feat considering that hes working with a CGI character) agreeably playing the straight man and happily throwing himself into his physical shtick. The appealingly laid-back Seyfried proves adept as well easily holding her own with her co-stars as Samantha inevitably becomes a love interest for John. The real love story of course is the bromance between John and Ted with the characters loosey-goosey interactions including harmonizing to the Law amp; Order theme song complete with made-up lyrics providing the films funniest moments. Their relationship will no doubt deepen even further in the inevitable third installment.
