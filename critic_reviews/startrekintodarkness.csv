By Anthony Lane Credit Photograph by Eric Ogden It seemed illogical when John Belushi played Captain Kirk on ""Saturday Night Live"" in 1976 that ""Star Trek"" could still be a sentient dramatic form thirty-seven years later. The skit showed an NBC executive in blazer and shades played by Elliott Gould invading the bridge of the U.S.S. Enterprise and announcing the death of the original TV series--a death that had already occurred in 1969. Phasers were to be confiscated and returned to the props department. Gould ripped the ears off Spock (Chevy Chase) and tossed them on the floor. And Belushi was perfect; he mimicked the dying falls of William Shatners voice and added a smear of his own perennial fatigue never that far from disgust. The deconstruction process was complete. How could any show come back from that? And now look at it. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" directed by J. J. Abrams is a great thundering cudgel of a movie set to stun. It continues the rebuilding of the franchise that was initiated by Abrams in ""Star Trek"" in 2009 with much of the same cast Chris Pine as Kirk Zachary Quinto as Spock Zoe Saldana as Uhura Karl Urban as Bones Anton Yelchin as Chekov (who stands in as chief engineer) John Cho as Sulu and Simon Pegg as a semi-Scottish Scotty. New to the scene is Peter Weller--a fine actor frightening and reflective who was well used by Antonioni and David Cronenberg though he is still best known for the jutting of his mandible in ""RoboCop."" In this film he plays a Starfleet admiral and one glance at that taut bony face tells you that he considers the old mission statement--exploring strange new worlds and all that--to be no more than long-distance tree-hugging. How about anchoring the Enterprise off the shore of a distant Klingon hangout and launching seventy-two photon torpedoes? Thats more like it. The cause of this intemperate act is a man named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) although that is a nom de guerre. When he reveals his true identity half the audience will yawn while the other half--Trekkies who revere the ""Star Trek"" of the nineteen-sixties in the way that certain Catholics hark back to liturgical life before Vatican II--will dissolve into warm trembling puddles beneath their seats. Harrison having created havoc on Earth and fled through space is caught and hauled onto the Enterprise. ""Seems that we have a superman on board"" Bones says. Wrong movie Doctor We are also told that Harrison has ""superblood"" which suggests that the screenplay was composed not by Roberto Orci Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof as the credits claim but by a classroom of eight-year-olds. All of which presents a problem how do you dig deep into a character when hes only two inches thick? Benedict Cumberbatch has found international fame with the BBCs ""Sherlock""--a chance to meld his honeyed mellifluous voice with the comical speed of tongue and of wits that the part of Holmes demands. The timbre remains in Abramss film and there is sufficient natural oddity in Cumberbatch with his stone-still posture and his polished unhandsome features to hint at an alien gene but the movie simply gives him too little to bite on. ""I am better"" he tells his captors. ""At what?"" ""Everything"" he replies. Yeah whatever. In most respects sad to say starting with the grammatical fuzz of the title ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" marks a big leap backward from Abramss effort of 2009--and even further from his handling of ""Super 8"" (2011) whose teen-age heroes were so much more appealing and more acutely observed than any of the tight-suited strivers on the Enterprise. As for the new plot it proceeds by spasm and lurch. At one juncture for no good reason other than a desperate injection of suspense Bones descends to a ""planetoid"" in the company of an implausible weapons expert (Alice Eve) just to inspect a torpedo. Later on the same principle the warp drive on the Enterprise sputters to a halt forcing poor Chekov to stop drafting his sequel to ""The Cherry Orchard"" and change the carburetor in the warp-core. The climaxes come one after another with diminishing returns. By the end the sight of a crippled spaceship crashing into San Francisco counts as a welcome breather. As if to counter this chaos more intimate scenes are moisturized in ways that Shatner and other veterans would find risible. For one thing people keep weeping. Why? The only thing at stake here is intergalactic war and peace. Toward the end even Spock succumbs for crying out loud; I hoped that Vulcan tears might prove to be made of nitric acid and that he might blow his nose and burn a hole in his handkerchief but no joy. The gist is that he has finally broken the interspecies barrier and experienced human feelings but this surely sets a dreadful precedent. As a biologically determined hard-ass Spock may flirt with mortal mush but must never yield to it and if hes going to spend the next few movies mooning over his fellow crew members like something out of ""The Notebook"" and assuring them that hell always be there for them what is the point of him or his ears? You wind up feeling doubly bullied--first by the brutal enormity of the set pieces and then by the emotional arm-twisting of the downtimes. Neither bears more than the faintest impress of reality and the outcome is not a proper film at all. Its a filmoid. No happy families are alike. Turn a camera on them and they will start to look unhappy in their own way. Such is one of the thoughts arising from ""Stories We Tell"" a film by Sarah Polley. Her previous works as a director ""Away from Her"" and ""Take This Waltz"" revolved around fictional characters--women cut adrift from the course of their lives and swept into unexpected currents. No need for the new movie to look so far; it is a documentary about Polleys nearest and dearest. You could call it family history except that as Polley discovers the present remains flooded by the past. The dear is always near. At the beginning we are introduced to Sarahs father Michael; to her siblings Joanna Susy Mark and John; and to a few aging friends with names like Harry and Mort each of them summoned in turn and asked to remember. They seem genial enough making the usual cracks about how nervous they are how they will appear onscreen whether they can take a pee before they start and so forth. Yet beneath the bonhomie you sense a more deep-bedded anxiety which Polley taps away at with a mischievous good cheer. ""Weve told you its a documentary but its actually an interrogation process"" she says. The common theme is Diane Polley Sarahs mother who died of cancer twenty-three years ago when Sarah was eleven. Diane was a laugher a partygoer and a fount of delight; John used to watch ""I Love Lucy"" and think that Lucille Ball was his mother. She and her husband were both actors based in Toronto but she found him increasingly sparkless and disappointing. Like many openhearted souls she kept her secrets firmly stashed away among them the question of what occurred and who was involved when she once went to Montreal to do a play and left Michael in charge of the kids. There was a long-standing in-joke that Sarah never resembled her father and as with most such jokes it became less funny over time and more tender to the touch. Had her actual father been one of the performers in that play--Tom Wayne or Geoff? And who would want to star in a real-life rerun of ""Mamma Mia"" without Abba to soothe the pain? ""Stories We Tell"" finds a dazzling and difficult poise between obfuscation and epiphany. The stuff that gets unearthed is hardly shattering and some viewers will read the ending as a happy one. Others though will notice worrying levels of fallout ""Oh we all got divorced"" Joanna says with a merry smile when asked about the aftermath of Sarahs inquiries and there is a squirm of discomfort early on when Mark mutters darkly about not speaking on the advice of his lawyer. Yet that is not what needles you most. The Polleys had a cine-camera and Sarah makes lavish use of old footage; but so adept is she at locating the exact shots sometimes from decades earlier to match the contributors spoken memories that you start to harbor suspicions. Could she be inventing as well as recording? We are told for example that after Diane passed away a mourning Michael spent hours playing solitaire; and right on cue up comes a grainy sequence of his younger self at cards. I will say no more except that Polley in her conjurors artfulness demonstrates that it is possible both to keep something up your sleeve and to wear your heart on it. Seldom has our modern taste for the confessional mode been so smartly explored although it must be said by the end part of me wanted to get out of the cinema into fresh and less constrictive air where family truths are still there for the grasping or so we like to believe. I kept thinking of Spock in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" and of his proud declaration ""Vulcans cannot lie."" Lucky them.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Zade Rosenthal/Courtesy Paramount Pictures The opening sequence of J.J. Abrams new entry in the Star Trek universe has all the ingredients of the classic franchise. Theres Kirk and his crew bellowing on the bridge everyone worrying about the prime directive and our favorite Vulcan trapped in a volcano. Star Trek Into Darkness Director J.J. Abrams Genre Science Fiction Running Time 132 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence. With Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Zoe Saldana Benedict Cumberbatch OK Im in. I may not be a fanboy anymore but I sure was in my youth and having these guys in their youths again is just as cool at the outset as it was last time. Related NPR Stories Movie Interviews Quinto Turns Inward To Find Spocks Soul Monkey See The Fundamentals Of Battle Star Wars Versus Star Trek Chris Pines baby-Shatner is spitting his lines while Zachary Quinto channels his inner Nimoy. We know these characters even if the reboot resulted in some weirdness. Spock and Uhura romantically involved for instance. Even Kirk seems perplexed by that one. Just as TVs original Trek boldly went where 60s civics classes had gone before Star Trek Into Darkness tackles issues with a contemporary ring. Theres a suicide bombing drones and some chatter about genetic engineering. All of it is debated by Kirks man of action Spocks man of thought and a villain whos a little of each. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a consummate warrior who surrenders to Kirk when he clearly doesnt have to. Director Abrams is working with a script that touches just about every touchstone from the original series you could imagine which means I cant talk about much of anything without spoiling the fun. Happily theres a good deal of fun if you like things crashing violently into each other and out of warp-drive at regular intervals. At one point while a character urgently aligned what looked like giant sparkplugs as if the drifting Enterprise were a stalled Buick I found myself thinking that the film seemed aimed pretty precisely at the mindset of a 16-year-old boy. There is lot of stuff blowing up strong feelings nobody quite knows what to do with rule-breaking is a turn-on and girls are largely eye candy and confounding. All of this is tied to a plot thats almost entirely concerned with getting from one cliffhanger to the next which is exciting but never left me feeling terribly engaged to borrow a term from a later generations commander. This team of filmmakers knows how to make the sparks fly and how to mix the sparks with feeling but it doesnt bother making the sparks and feeling matter very much. Does that matter very much? Probably not if youre just looking to trek with a bucket of popcorn into some multiplex darkness.

Its right there in their respective titles--a saga of exploration versus one of conflict. Related Story A Grating Gatsby The distinction has never been total of course but it began to collapse altogether with J. J. Abramss first Star Trek film in 2009 and its demise was rendered official with the news early this year that the director would also be taking over future installments of the Star Wars franchise. Abramss latest outing Star Trek Into Darkness for better or worse represents a final burial. The Trekkie trappings are still in evidence--distinctly more so in fact than in the previous installment. The movie ruminates loudly if never very coherently about war and peace vengeance and justice preemptive attack and negotiated settlement. In case were unclear on which side the film comes down--or how its lessons might be relevant to the present day--a central character helpfully summarizes at the conclusion ""There will always be those who mean to do us harm. To stop them we risk awakening the same evil in ourselves."" Are you listening Vice President Cheney?Ultimately though such moralizing amounts to little more than narrative window dressing which is perhaps appropriate for a film whose deeper message is that all rules--the Prime Directive the injunction against altering history--are made to be broken. The rule-breaker-in-chief is again James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) whom we first reencounter running though an alien jungle pursued by primitive natives. (Is it just me or did they sound for just a moment like Tusken Raiders?) Its not long before hes leaping off a cliff toward the ocean below--the first of several times in the course of the film that he will find himself at odds with gravity a law he is unable to break.In most respects Star Trek Into Darkness bears a close similarity to its predecessor. The screenplay (by Roberto Orci Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof) is baroque and preposterous with plot holes big enough to drive a Constitution class cruiser through. The action sequences are plentiful and characterized by a certain gee-whiz exuberance. This being an Abrams/Lindelof venture there are multiple sets of Daddy Issues to resolve. And we are subjected to an escalating experiment in the human tolerance for lens flare an effect that when rendered in 3-D has a neuro-ocular impact not unlike that of an oncoming motorist with his high beams on.As before the movies strongest suit is its cast. Pine plays Kirk as one part Han Solo and two parts Evel Knievel. Zachary Quinto continues to find wit and nuance within the tight characterological constraints of Mr. Spock. Zoe Saldana (Uhura) Karl Urban (McCoy) Simon Pegg (Scotty) John Cho (Sulu) and Anton Yelchin (Chekov) round out the crew and Bruce Greenwood and Peter Weller appear as Star Fleet admirals/Daddy figures--Dadmirals?--both good and bad. Benedict Cumberbatch makes a strong impression as the Villain Whose True Identity I Am Contractually Forbidden to Reveal and Alice Eve makes almost none at all as new science officer Carol Marcus. (Her principle role in the film is to appear briefly in her underwear thus achieving the dual purposes of supplying Kirk with a romantic interest for the next installment and reaffirming the commitment of any Trekboys whose enthusiasm for spaceships has begun to wane.) For all its chasing and falling and fighting--and the movie supplies a great deal of each--Star Trek Into Darkness is at its best when the Enterprise crew are merely bickering and bantering among themselves less space opera than soap opera. Indeed I would have been happy if Abrams had taken away their high-tech toys altogether for a while a la Iron Man 3 and left them to their playful squabbling.For all its chasing and falling and fighting Star Trek Into Darkness is at its best when the Enterprise crew are merely bickering and bantering. But no there are fugitives to capture and warp drives to repair and Klingons to stare down and special effects budgets to be spent. It all works well enough in its openly dizzy way for the first hour and a half or so and that may provide enough momentum to power most viewers over the finish line. (The movie clocks in at a relatively forgiving 134 minutes.) For my part I found my interest flagging in the final act. Without giving away details Abrams inverts a classic sequence from Treks past and in so doing reaches simultaneously for an emotional crescendo and an extended inside joke Its unclear whether were supposed to laugh or cry. Moreover amid the principal casts mortal melodramas--characters saving one anothers lives dying for the greater good etc.--the movie scarcely pauses to note let alone mourn the lives of tens of thousands of San Franciscans it has implicitly sacrificed in the service of a special effect. (Im hardly a stickler but it does seem that a film explicitly dedicated to post-9/11 veterans might be a bit less casual about toppling skyscrapers in a major American city.)Until that point though Star Trek Into Darkness is a loose and giddy ride a more recognizable heir to George Lucas than to Gene Roddenberry. Only time will tell whether its a good idea to make Abrams the future custodian of Star Wars. But given where hes already taken the Trek franchise its almost certainly a redundant one.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace.

We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane.

""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Comments (20) click to enlarge Star Trek Into Darkness Video Rated PG-13  132 minutes  2013 The starship Enterprise blasts off again going boldly where its gone innumerable times before. As in the successful 2009 reboot the blockbuster machinery overwhelms everything else though this hardly matters because everything else is recycled characters (the wicked Khan played here by Benedict Cumberbatch) conflicts (the stale debate over logic versus emotion) and themes (weepy male romance as Spock watches Kirk expire inside a quarantine chamber just as Kirk watched Spock die in Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan). The conceptual sci-fi of the original series is nowhere to be found though you might enjoy watching the skinny young actors approximate their counterparts from the 60s; Chris Pine is especially good as Captain Kirk reviving the cocky young adventurer of the TV show instead of the chunky sub-Shakespearean agonist of the later movies.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Zade Rosenthal) less This undated publicity film image released by Paramount Pictures shows Zachary Quinto left as Spock and Chris Pine as Kirk in a scene in the movie ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" from Paramount Pictures and ... more Photo Zade Rosenthal Review Star Trek Into Darkness both funny and thoughtful 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" the second installment of the rebooted ""Star Trek"" series -- depicting the early careers of Kirk Spock and the whole Enterprise crew -- has the self-consciousness of a sequel. Its written and conceived in full awareness of everything people liked about the previous movie and with a determination to make everything even bigger and better this time. Here and there that becomes bigger and worse. The last film had an amazing opening sequence showing the birth of Captain Kirk and the death of his father. And so in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" they try to top it by beginning the movie with Kirk on the run from the primitive makeup-wearing natives of a doomed planet. The entire episode is so tangential that with the slightest tinkering it could be excised from the story. Likewise in response to the appealing emotion of the last film this time Kirk and Spock dont just like each other. The love is so palpable that soon Spock might have to turn in his ears. Yet every time ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" looks as though its about to retreat behind the wall of silly something happens that surprises or delights or demonstrates the filmmakers genuine knowledge of and affection for these characters. The film is for whatever else it might be one of the funniest of the ""Star Trek"" entries. The wisecracks are grounded in character with some flashes that are welcome and unexpected and others that are totally expected and necessary Youre not allowed to make a ""Star Trek"" movie without McCoy insisting ""I am a doctor"" at least once. More Information  Review ""Star Trek Into Darkness""Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violenceLength 132 minutes Excellent  Good  Fair  Poor ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is also one of the entries most clearly of its time (that is our time) with story elements directly in response to events taking place in our world. As such the movie stands beside the original TV show which was often as much about the concerns of the late 1960s as it was about the distant future. So once again we find the ultimate team a marriage of complementary strengths and temperaments. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a young hotshot who trusts his instincts and has disdain for the rules and Spock (Zachary Quinto) is strictly by the book worships the rules and trusts only logic. In these early incarnations they are too much like themselves -- and not enough like each other -- but they will learn to be their best by toning down yet retaining their original natures. Its a partnership tested under pressure. An interplanetary terrorist organization run by John Harrison -- a mysterious and icy-cold superman (Benedict Cumberbatch) detonates a bomb at the Federations London archive. Later the villain has the colossal effrontery to attack Federation leaders at their main headquarters in San Francisco. The comparison to todays terrorism cant be missed. More subtle yet equally clear is the moral analogue between Peter Weller as a Starfleet officer who wants to kill everybody irrespective of interplanetary law and todays hard-liners. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a straight-up summer action movie and so its rather interesting and surprising to see how willing director J.J. Abrams and the screenwriters are to go beyond the good guy-bad guy thing and look at some gray areas. Indeed at one point the Enterprise is the one locus of light in a sea of gray There are no clear-cut choices and their opponents and allies are just as good as they are bad. Some rooting interest is sacrificed but whats gained is a rumination on morality and judgment. Spock that is Spock Prime as in Leonard Nimoy makes another appearance giving young Spock subtle hints about the future. Kirk Prime still hasnt shown up in these series yet -- I know Kirk is supposedly dead but if the future has been changed by the new generation might he not still be alive? It would be worth the credibility stretch just to see how new Kirk reacts to Classic Kirk. Theyre both so vain they might not hit it off. mlasallesfchronicle.com Todays Deals Lenovo Sale Up to 36% off + free shipping Apple Smartwatches at Best Buy 50 off from 249 + free...

AP AP AP AP MCT More information Star Trek Into Darkness Director J.J. Abrams Cast Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Rated PG-13 (intense sequences of science-fiction action and violence) Running time 132 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 649am on Friday May. 17 2013 Friday May. 17 2013 Thursday May. 16 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Theres a scene in Star Trek Into Darkness J.J. Abrams second installment in his reimagining of the voyages of the starship Enterprise that seems almost lifted from the pages of the most ardent fan fiction. Just as we think Captain Kirk may have set his last phaser on stun he and Spock have a bromantic epiphany that gets even the emotionless pointy-eared second-in-command teary-eyed.Its the kind of moment thats going to have longtime followers of the franchise purring like tribbles and its just one of many in this entertaining adventure that doesnt quite live up to the bleak promise of its title.Chris Pine returns as the young Kirk who as the movie opens loses his title as captain after violating the Federations ""prime directive"" against interfering with the development of an alien culture. But Kirk had a good reason to reveal humankinds technology to the primitive souls of the planet Nibiru to rescue his good buddy Spock (Zachary Quinto) from the inside of an erupting volcano -- because thats the kind of thing good friends do for each other.Back on Earth Kirk is nursing his emotional wounds when hes called back to duty after a terror attack in London. The guy behind it is the cunning if blandly named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) whos got a freezer full of beefs with Star Fleet. And it may not just be madman talk.Star Fleet Admiral Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller) is up to something showing that the Federation -- an unstoppable force for good in Gene Roddenberrys original vision of Star Trek -- may be just as riven with politics and power plays as any other human organization.Faster than you can say ""live long and prosper"" the Enterprise is sent to hunt down and kill Harrison and its here -- with talk of the Federations true mission and summarily killing people without trial -- that Star Trek Into Darkness seems ripped from todays headlines not those of the 23rd century where its set. You half expect someone to mention ""drones"" or call a planet Gitmo. But Abrams and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman ( Transformers the last Star Trek movie) dont really push the political angle too hard and Star Trek Into Darkness ends up being less provocative -- and less dark -- than it might have been. They make up for that with a rousing sense of action and humor that builds upon what everyone knows about these characters Kirks womanizing Spocks logic not to mention the engineering derring-do of Scotty (Simon Pegg) and the ""Damn it Jim Im a doctor"" stridency of Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban).Cumberbatch a British actor previously seen in War Horse Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and the Sherlock TV series makes for a formidable foe and his character offers a surprise twist -- though its been leaked all over the Internet by now. Star Trek Into Darkness is a step forward from Abrams initial foray into this universe in the 2009 movie. It will be intriguing to see where he takes it from here though in between theres that other little movie he has to do Star Wars. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Abramss ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" the sequel to his prequel delivers the goods even if some of the goods are less than fresh. Since Disney has also entrusted him with the ""Star Wars"" franchise I guess hes officially Hollywoods anointed one for all things outer space.Capt. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) are the emotional core - such as it is - of this space odyssey. After Kirk disobeys a Starfleet dictum and rescues Spock from a bubbling volcano on a prehistoric planet heads roll. Kirk feels unloved by the man he rescued but hey the guy is only half human. (Ive often wondered if the Vulcan half is actually the emotional half.) Their rapprochement is the films true climax even more than the battle royal between the Enterprise and a very bad cyborg-like guy whose name is John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) but who actually inhabits an identity hallowed in the annals of Trekkiedom.Since 9/11-style terrorism is very much on display here I suppose its fair to say that ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a sci-fi blow-out with overtones of the real. Series founder Gene Roddenberry would I think approve. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence.)

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a scene in Star Trek Into Darkness J.J. Abrams zippy operatic return to the final frontier that includes what can only be described as a new cliche of blockbuster myth-making. The good guys hotheaded James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his relentlessly logical foil Spock (Zachary Quinto) have arrested and imprisoned the bad guy a stoic terrorist-demigod played by the imposingly proper British actor Benedict Cumberbatch. The heavy is safely contained behind a thick plate of Starfleet-grade glass. So why does it feel as though he has his captors right where he wants them? Anyone whos seen Skyfall or The Avengers The Dark Knight or Abrams own Mission Impossible III will recognize this textbook tactic in establishing villainous bona fides. (In truth it probably goes back to Hannibal Lector--a fiend never more menacing then when scheming in captivity.) That the scene still works like gangbusters is a testament to the primal goosebump-provoking power of Cumberbatchs performance. For the first time in years maybe decades the crew of the Enterprise faces a worthy adversary though he ends up proving more of a physical threat than a cerebral one. Yes brawn trumps brains again in Abrams alternate-universe Star Trek where the heady philosophical concerns of Gene Roddenberrys original series take a back seat to expertly engineered pyrotechnics. Even more so than its 2009 reboot predecessor Into Darkness is a machine built for speed fueled by its unyielding digital cacophony and the popping personalities of its bickering spacemen. (The spacewomen alas still havent been given much to do besides look good in flattering regulation uniforms.) This Trek is taller faster and stronger than the last one but its not quite better. The warp-speed pacing makes Into Darkness consistently nimble entertainment but it also obscures some of the careful character work Abrams achieved during his first outing in the captains chair. ""I thought we were explorers"" moans Scotty (Simon Pegg still delightful) in protest of the crews militaristic marching orders--a seek-and-destroy mission through enemy territory. The search for Cumberbatchs turncoat who lays siege to Starfleet in one of the films numerous sound-and-fury showdowns serves as the catalyst for this war-minded sequel. As pure spectacle Into Darkness delivers. The opening chase scene--set on a gorgeously crimson alien world--is a puckish tribute to the stranded-on-a-rock away-mission episodes of the original TV show. Theres also a wonderfully kinetic human-missile sequence and a topsy-turvy passage in which Pine must navigate a turned-on-its-ear Enterprise as though he were traversing the capsized Titanic. Is this a 200 million dry-run to the directors forthcoming Star Wars sequel? Rip-roaring set-pieces aside the biggest pleasure here is still the yin-yang chemistry between Kirk and Spock even as the writers sand down the barbed edges of the characters interactions. (The two are full-fledged friends now brothers even; the antagonism is missed.) Quinto looking and sounding more Nimoy-ish than ever remains the heart and soul of this spit-shined Trek but the last movie gave him a bit more to sink his teeth into. Having largely gotten a handle on his un-Vulcan-like temper Spock spends much of Into Darkness serving as a mouthpiece--airing moral objections providing a voice of reason reminding audiences of the core Trek principles. (Theres a stodgier less sexy movie in the repercussions of the first scene in which a flagrant violation of the Prime Directive reshapes an entire civilization.) Through Quinto Abrams pays lip-service to bigger political and ethical questions before moving along to the next CGI blitzkrieg. While Into Darkness rarely resembles the thinking-mans science fiction saga it purports to continue the films worst moments are ironically the ones in which it pays direct homage to its forebears. For especially misguided example Abrams parallel-timeline conceit allows him to re-imagine one of the most iconic scenes (and lines) in the Trek canon through a revisionist callback as cynical as the entirety of Super 8. But theres a middle ground between too much reverence and not enough and the actors hit it consistently. The new Enterprise crew--not just Pine and Quinto but also Karl Urbans hilariously cranky Bones and John Chos steely Sulu--nicely capture the spirit of their characters without ever resorting to imitating those who used to play them. Heres to boldly going where others have gone before but taking different routes to get there.

Abrams is often dinged by Trekkers for daring to futz with the Star Trek universe (theyll probably stone him when he revives Star Wars). I thought his 2009 Trek reboot proved the naysayers nuts. And now Abrams boldly goes into Star Trek Into Darkness and crushes it again. Its more fun and more intense without giving less to the characters. The Enterprise crew is back plus a sexy stowaway (Alice Eve). Zachary Quinto is a marvel as the Vulcan Spock war between intellect and id raging inside his half-human brain. This brings tension into his bromance with Kirk (a fired-up Chris Pine) the rule-busting starship officer not averse to a three-way with two aliens. More News Seven Questions for Star Trek Villain Benedict Cumberbatch The Top 10 Star Trek Villains 26 Movies Not to Miss This Summer All Stories >> Like the best of Trek on TV the script by Roberto Orci Alex Kurtzman and the invaluable Damon Lindelof (Abrams co-creator on Lost) is sharply topical. Domestic terrorism drives the plot putting Kirk and Spock into conflict with a villain for the ages. Hed be John Harrison and the brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock Holmes) plays him in a tour de force to reckon with. Spoilers would cause me more trouble than an army of Klingons. One hint If you rewatch any Star Trek movie before seeing this one make it 1982s iconic The Wrath of Khan. Kudos to Abrams for going bigger without going stupid. His set pieces from an erupting volcano to the hell unleashed over London and Frisco Bay are doozies. Sos the movie. Its crazy good.

"Star Trek Into Darkness | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; star-trek-into-darkness_2619 ) Star Trek Into Darkness (United States 2013) May 15 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Spoiler Alert This review contains spoilers. Not earthshattering plot revelations but hints that might dampen the virgins pristine viewing experience. Proceed with caution if this sort of thing concerns you. In moving to the future J.J. Abrams has pillaged the past. One could make an argument that Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan has cast a long shadow over the entire Star Trek movie franchise. Attempts to recreate the suspense of the second Trek feature were evident in Star Trek III The Search for Spock Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country and Star Trek (X) Nemesis. Villains like Christopher Lloyds Kruge Christopher Plummers Chang Malcolm McDowells Soran and Tom Hardys Shinzon were inevitably compared to Ricardo Montalbans iconic superman. For J.J. Abrams whose genesis of an alternate Star Trek universe/timeline in his 2009 feature allows him great freedom to move forward without obliterating ""canon"" the decision to make another attempt at replicating the alchemy of the first Star Trek sequel might be considered ""safe."" But little about where Star Trek Into Darkness plunges is without risk. Long running franchises like Star Trek survive because they embrace change while maintaining connections to what came before. The James Bond series has featured six starring actors and while the continuity is a nightmare there are a lot of little hooks that tie the films together. Doctor Who changes its lead every four or five years but never forgets its past. In rebooting Star Trek Abrams found a way to tie his universe to the pre-existing one where five TV series and ten movies transpired. Leonard Nimoys presence forms the bridge. The octogenarian actor making an appearance in his eighth Star Trek movie serves much the same purpose here as in 2009s adventure. (Ironic that the man who once tried desperately to divorce himself from his Trek alter-ego has become the one to play it the most often.) His cameo isnt mandatory; its a Valentine to those long-term loyalists who have been with the series for nearly 50 years. In fact with admitted uber-fan Bob Orci on the screenwriting team the movie is loaded with little ""Easter eggs"" for Trekkies/Trekkers. Star Trek Into Darkness doesnt feel like a ""Star Trek film"" - at least if one defines that term based on the 80s productions. Its much more action/adventure oriented. The space battles unfold with lightning quickness rather than as suspenseful gradual events. Theres some nice character interaction but the new actors havent been together long enough to replicate the easy camaraderie evidenced among the core group of Shatner/Nimoy/Kelley. Nevertheless Chris Pine Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban are good enough that we never feel like were watching imposters. Pines Kirk has the swagger looks and heroism to match Shatners. Quinto finds the balance between logic and emotion that Nimoy mastered. And Urbans McCoy offers a near-perfect echo of Kelleys sardonic wit and countrified humanism - a true homage. The film picks up a short time after the conclusion of the 2009 entry. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew are trying to save a primitive society from an erupting volcano. In the process Spock (Zachary Quinto) becomes trapped and Kirk must violate The Federations ""Prime Directive"" to save him. This results in the Enterprise being given back to Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and Kirk being demoted to First Officer. However as this is happening a rogue Starfleet officer Commander John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) has declared war on his employers. He detonates a bomb in London then stages a sneak attack on Starfleet Headquarters in San Francisco. Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) Pikes superior gives Kirk back his ship with new orders track down Harrison who has gone into hiding on the Klingon home planet and bring him to justice. Star Trek Into Darkness does some admittedly unique things with Harrisons character. At first he appears to be little more than a standard-order terrorist with an extreme grudge but as the story unfolds we learn that at least theres a reason underlying his actions. Cumberbatch does an excellent job portraying Harrison as more than a one-dimensional bad guy. Theres a lot of depth to the portrayal - arguably more than the character deserves. This is a fast-paced production (as befits a would-be summer blockbuster); it doesnt take many breaks for exposition. Nevertheless it seems to have fewer obvious plot holes than the 2009 Star Trek and is at least equally engaging. The film takes an opportunity to do what the old Star Trek often did and use a futuristic scenario to comment on contemporary issues - in this case terrorism and the policy of manufacturing a war to eliminate a perceived threat. If theres an obvious flaw its that the ending is an anticlimax; proceedings conclude with a whimper. After an epic journey featuring distant worlds space battles and surprise revelations it all comes down to a fist fight. The movie also cheats by playing on the viewers emotions (although Star Trek has been guilty of that from time-to-time - Im thinking specifically of ""Amok Time""). One of the most controversial aspects of Star Trek Into Darkness is likely to be the extended segment lifted almost intact (albeit with a role reversal) from one of the earlier Star Trek films. Some will see this as theft but I prefer to view it as Im sure its intended an homage and another opportunity to find familiarity in a newly reshaped universe. This stuff worked for me - especially the very loud utterance of a famous line - but some may not feel the same way. In addition to Cumberbatch there are two other newcomers in significant roles Alice Eve and Peter Weller as the daughter-and-father team of Dr. Carol Marcus and her dad. Eves role is limited but Star Trek fans know that in the other timeline she was Kirks lover and the mother of his son. Whether that history will be repeated in this universe remains to be seen. Weller plays the upper echelon Starfleet admiral in much the same way that upper echelon Starfleet admirals have been portrayed since the TV series aired in the 1960s - which is to say as more of an obstacle than a help. The special effects are first rate - not always the case with Star Trek movies although Abrams has been given a budget the likes of which directors Nicholas Meyer Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner would have salivated over. The 3-D is thankfully not an abomination. Compensations have been made for many of the usual problems with the format. On the other hand it adds little making the surcharge an unnecessary expense. Michael Giacchinos score is reminiscent of the work he did on the 2009 film. He waits until the end to use the Alexander Courage theme but when he employs it he does so with relish. From time-to-time he also echoes (without directly copying) some of the music that Jerry Goldsmith contributed over the years. J.J. Abrams wanted Star Trek Into Darkness to be the revived franchises The Dark Knight. In establishing this lofty goal he forced himself to take some bold steps yet for all the suspense action and special effects razzle-dazzle the movie doesnt ascend to the highest pinnacle of big budget entertainment. Its an immensely satisfying summer blockbuster but its not a genre-defining masterpiece. Its hard to imagine many die-hard Star Trek fans putting Star Trek Into Darkness ahead of The Wrath of Khan on their personal ""best of"" lists. Nevertheless this is sufficiently rousing and entertaining that it should please a majority of movie-goers whether theyre confessed Trek fans or not. In the wake of Star Trek Into Darkness the familiar characters look ready to continue to live long and prosper. Star Trek Into Darkness (United States 2013) Director J.J.

RELATED NEWS 14 best movie franchises Interview Zachary Quinto talks being Spock By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed May 15 2013 1022 AM Whenever someone makes a movie from an existing source complaints follow. Based on a novel? Not as good as the book. Remake? Not as good as the original. Messing around again with a reboot of ""Star Trek""? Now thems fightin words. Some Trekkies the hardcore fans of the original television series had serious complaints about ""Star Trek"" J.J. Abrams 2009 recharge of the franchise. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is going to make their heads explode. The new film with Abrams again directing before heading off to make the new ""Star Wars"" movie (which some Trekkies complained was what he was trying to do with ""Star Trek"" anyway) both honors and plays with the legacy of Gene Roddenberrys creation. Thats my take anyway. I thought it was really fun an inventive surprising rethinking of some of ""Star Treks"" most hallowed inventions but Im not wedded to the source material as gospel. Trekkies will think its a desecration. So pick your side. The film begins on some far-flung planet or other where James Kirk (Chris Pine) and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise including Spock (Zachary Quinto) Bones (Karl Urban) and Scotty (Simon Pegg) are trying to fix things without the inhabitants realizing it. (They have their orders about that sort of meddling after all.) Kirk is still a cocky headstrong sort which lands him in hot water with his superiors (again). But then a terrorist attack on Starfleet changes things considerably. The man behind the attacks is no secret since the film makes no effort to hide him Its John Harrison a former Starfleet officer played brilliantly by Benedict Cumberbatch whose icy aloofness (and superhuman strength) makes him a great bad guy. Or is he a bad guy? He says no that he was duped by someone else that ... well maybe the film is harboring a few secrets. No. No more of the story here. There is one great surprise a ""whoa"" moment that is stunningly great and then an overarching reveal in which you realize that Abrams is messing with us a little bit. Or a lot. I found it immensely satisfying. Some are just going to be ticked off. But surely even those who dont like anyone toying with the ""Star Trek"" mythology who find even the slightest tweaking of it blasphemy will appreciate what Abrams is trying to do here. Which is it seems first and foremost to make a good movie. Abrams motives are his own but how freeing it must be to slip away from the constraints others would impose upon a filmmaker who takes up the mantle of the franchise. If all this sounds a little circumspect a little nebulous well thats the idea. It is fair game however to say that the cast is once again perfect in their roles and Quinto still looks like Leonard Nimoy who again makes a cameo as the original Spock (though frankly in this case the circumstance felt like a bit of a cheat). Abrams can stage a good action scene; maybe its because hes had a lot of practice. They pop up with regularity throughout the movie. And Cumberbatch is an evil delight if he is indeed evil. Whatever he is hes magnetic with a regal bearing and air of superiority that serves the character. But the heart of the film as with the previous iteration of the franchise as with the TV show as with the fan fiction and everything else is the relationship between Kirk and Spock. Which is to say heart vs. head emotion vs. reason. It remains a volatile-yet-successful mix. Like most things Abrams does (how many times must he have watched ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" before making ""Super 8?"") ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a giddy homage to whats come before it but it also at least tries to go boldly where ... well you know. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday May 15 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday May 15 2013 600PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by J.J. Abrams Written by Roberto Orci Alex Kurtzman Damon Lindelof Starring Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Zoe Saldana Benedict Cumberbatch Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English For those who enjoyed J.J. Abramss frisky relaunch of Star Trek back in 2009 the good news is that the new Star Trek Into Darkness is more of the same. The bad news is that Star Trek Into Darkness is well a bit too familiar. This should please the diehard fans but leave more casual fans hovering on the edges of the Trek universe with an uncomfortable sensation that the USS Enterprise and its crew may be doomed to an eternity of recurrences. Multimedia Star Trek Into Darkness The official trailer For the first hour director Abrams is to paraphrase Gilbert and Sullivan the very model of a major modern movie-maker. He guides the tiller with a firm hand and pushes all the buttons in the right fast-scene slow-scene order. He works the 3-D depth unobtrusively for a balance of big-screen spectacle and emotional intimacy and he knows the fan culture inside out. No surprise hell be directing the next Star Wars movie as well.The opening sequence set on an Avatar-like planet of clay-covered humanoids chasing Kirk (Chris Pine) and Bones (Karl Urban) through a forest of red trees while the entire planet is about to blow from a giant volcano. In the aftermath the crew is saved only to be punished and disbanded. Lieutenant Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is suffering wounded feelings toward Spock (Zachary Quinto) Kirk is demoted for insubordination by his superior (Bruce Greenwood) and the too-honest Spock has been assigned to another ship.All of this is a model of economy taking us through the Indiana Jones-style opening briskly re-introducing the new cast of characters and their various conflicts and setting up the motive for the new mission. Pine with his watery blue gaze now seems entirely relaxed in evoking William Shatners choppy speech patterns and swagger as James T. Kirk though hes still more of an impulsive brat. Similarly Quintos performance as young Spock emphasizes the characters aggrieved adolescence more than his supercilious intellect. The rest of the cast do amusingly baby-faced versions of the crew of the Enterprise first introduced to television viewers almost a half-century ago.A fresh catastrophe (thats the ""Into Darkness"" part of the title) brings the Enterprise together again. A bomb blows up the Starfleet facility in futuristic London (portrayed as a forest of multiform high-rises spearing the sky). The crew is reassembled for a covert mission directed by Admiral Marcus (Robocops Peter Weller) to track down and eliminate the enemy leader who goes by the innocuous name of John Harrison. Harrison has retreated to the planet Kronos on the edge of dangerous Klingon territory. Against Starfleet protocol Admiral Marcus insists the ship be armed with torpedoes which isnt the only extra baggage the Enterprise is carrying. A sexy science officer Carol (Alice Eve) lied to get onboard and she seems equally interested in Kirk and the ships torpedoes.As with the recent Iron Man 3 the antagonist here suggests Osama bin Laden. Once again a British actor with stage-trained gravitas is given the villain role. This time its Benedict Cumberbatch the bow-lipped star of Sherlock and the recent BBC series Parades End. He stands extremely still like a reptile ready to strike and proves a disturbingly calm adversary for the short-fused Kirk. ""Captain"" he says in a funereal baritone that drips with pained condescension. Cumberbatch says it so wonderfully in fact that the script provides him with a chance to say ""Captain"" exactly the same way a second time.To anyone looking to explore new frontiers be warned Star Trek Into Darkness slips not into darkness but into a dark echo-chamber of fanboy self-referentiality in Abramss second outing. Anyone with interest and an Internet connection will already know theres a familiar nemesis hiding behind John Harrisons handsome mug. As delectable as his vocal delivery is Cumberbatch is mostly on hand to provide chunks o backstory between the action scenes which are lined up like boxcars in the movies second half.Upping the brutality a notch as if to prove Star Trek isnt just for eggheads the script calls for enough old-fashioned face-punching to make the film feel more like Rocky 12 than the 12th Star Trek movie.All of this contributes to the impression that this is generally a coarser less buoyant affair than Abramss first Star Trek movie. That one left you leaving the theatre elated like the sensation of re-reading a favourite book after several years and rediscovering that it still charms. Star Trek Into Darkness offers much more qualified satisfaction which especially after the second half is akin to the relief of surviving a long beating.

Naturally the Vulcan stays cool as a cucumber ready to die to save his crew -- an impeccably logical decision that also happens to be the compassionate one. But Capt. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) commander of the U.S.S. Enterprise has other ideas. Hell rescue Spock even if that means violating a Federation rule that says the Enterprise cant be exposed to the planets uncivilized hordes. Kirk who never met a regulation he couldnt trash guides the starship up into the air and over to where his comrade is about to perish and the white-mud-caked warriors stare at the ship as if it were a god. Its a sensation that the movie transmits to the audience since the Enterprise emitting an awesome thrummm never looked quite so massive or looming. Four years ago director J.J. Abrams rebooted the Star Trek franchise with great swagger by treating the launch film as a unique pop culture origin story. The movie was all about how the Enterprise crew first came together but really it was about how Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto rose up to become those superheroes of yore Kirk and Spock by echoing the looks voices and personalities of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy just enough while still making the roles their own. The two actors now really have a chance to get their Kirk and Spock on. Pine with ice blue eyes and lips that dance on the edge of a smirk does something marvelously clever He evokes Shatners hamminess by underplaying it. And Quinto makes the glowering dagger-browed Spock almost fiercely withholding. Into Darkness provides room for these actors to deepen their interplay. The movie has an often sinister grandeur but the images never overpower the human (or Vulcan) factor. Like Abrams first Trek movie this one is positioned as a prequel to the original TV series and subsequent films though it also lifts (and twists) elements from that sacred text 1982s Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan. Kirk and Spock each following his own nature (hothead detached brainiac) are usually at loggerheads but even when they wind up coming to the same conclusion they cant stop arguing about how they got there and thats part of the movies texture of cocky one-upmanship. The whole Enterprise crew has become a collection of colliding egos. Zoe Saldanas badass Uhura whos in the middle of a lovers quarrel with Spock; John Cho as the so-stoic-hes-cool Sulu; Simon Peggs frantically funny and resourceful Scotty -- these characters pop out at us with a new dynamism. And they all confront a villain who has been brilliantly retrofitted to throw everyone including the audience off guard. This dastardly dude is a boyish-looking terrorist named John Harrison who starts off by striking a note of urban chaos. But its not long before hes revealed to be -- how can I say this? -- a foe familiar to Trekkies with a concealed agenda and 70 of his comrades cryogenically frozen in photon-torpedo capsules. Hes played by rising British star Benedict Cumberbatch in a totally original way with the physicality of a dancer and an eager puckish sincerity that ingeniously disguises his vengeful mission. Once Harrisons been captured and placed in a cell Kirk has to listen to his own hunches about who this man is and what he wants. Thats the real ""darkness"" the films title is referring to the place where youre no longer certain what the right thing to do is. And thats a place of genuine excitement. Into Darkness is a sleek thrilling epic thats also a triumphantly witty popcorn morality play. Its everything you could want in a Star Trek movie.

"Review Star Trek Into Darkness ramps up action leaves room for heart - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Star Trek Into Darkness ramps up action leaves room for heart Star Trek Into Darkness Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto star as the iconic characters James T. Kirk and Mr. Spock respectively. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto star as the iconic characters James T. Kirk and Mr. Spock respectively. Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" bursting at the seams with enemies wears its politics its mettle its moxie and its heart on its ginormous 3-D sleeve. Director J.J. Abrams and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise try to build a better sequel with action spectacles to get lost in clever asides to amuse emotional waves to ride and allusions to terrorism in general and 9/11 specifically.Abrams first reimagining of the beloved Gene Roddenberry franchise was a stellar surprise in 2009. The casting was spot-on with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto embodying and embellishing the iconic characters of James T. Kirk and Mr. Spock respectively. The story from screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman was highly inventive not easy for a franchise with 11 movies and four separate TV series under its plot-twisting belt. There were astute nods to that history -- Leonard Nimoys cameo as Spock in old age was by far the showstopper. The expectations were impossibly high but Abrams proved to be a cool-hand Luke as he kept the Enterprise moving at warp speed.VIDEO Upcoming summer films A follow-up was risky. And in fact ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" doesnt quite match 2009s blast from the past.There are times when it feels as if the director has pulled a page out of the Michael Bay playbook taking some of the action to exhaustive extremes. At other moments all that bravado collapses into safer-than-necessary choices. But before that whither-Star Trek sigh has time to build the film does something bold surprisingly pointed in its treatment of terrorism for one.So many things are done right that even with the bombast ""Into Darkness"" is the best of this summers biggies thus far. Its a great deal of brash fun and it should satisfy all those basic Trekkie cravings.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 The movie begins in blinding light. Kirk and Bones (Karl Urban) are making a mad dash through the red fields of Nibiru trying to distract and evade the planets primitive people -- bodies baked in clay painted faces spears superstitious you know the type. A volcano is about to destroy their world though they dont know it. Ice bombs and Spock come to the rescue.Naturally being dropped into a very hot spot doesnt phase Spock though I do believe he breaks a slight sweat. Hes not the only one in mortal danger and in short order Starfleet rules have been broken to save the day.The icy volcanic ash has barely cleared before Kirk and Spock have that age-old logic-versus-emotion argument. And they are barely back on Earth when they find themselves on the ropes for the Nibiru fiasco -- Kirk suspended Spock reassigned.Indeed there is virtually no time to breathe until the credits start rolling. The script by Kurtzman Orci and Damon Lindelof the latter of whom has a string of action/drama credits but most significantly created ""Lost"" with Abrams and Jeffrey Lieber sets an exceedingly fast pace.PHOTO GALLERY The Billion Dollar Box Office ClubWhich means Kirk has only started to grumble about Nibiru when a bomb blows up the Starfleets main archive in London. Control of the Enterprise is handed over to Kirks old mentor the no-longer wheelchair-bound Capt. Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Somehow before the ship lifts off Kirk and Spock are back on board along with the rest of the ""Star Trek"" essentials -- Uhura (Zoe Saldana) Sulu (John Cho) Scotty (Simon Pegg) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin). As are the top-notch film crew including director of photography Dan Mindel production designer Scott Chambliss costume designer Michael Kaplan and composer Michael Ciacchino.This time out ""Sherlocks"" Benedict Cumberbatch is the major menace to society. He portrays top Starfleet agent John Harrison who may or may not have gone rogue but is unquestionably indestructible. It makes for some fun fights. The race against time to track him down will have the Enterprise globe- and galaxy-hopping from a futuristic San Francisco and London circa 2259 filled with polished metal and glass spires to the down-and-dirty Kronos home planet of the Klingons. Just their mention is likely to elicit a cheer. At this point in time they are still archenemies.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsAs important as the Klingons and Cumberbatches of the Star Trek world are villains do not this franchise make. What helps keep the motor humming are the ships family dynamics the very familiar squabbles between crew members that all Trekkies and most of the rest of the movie universe know so well. It is here that ""Into Darkness"" really shines. One of the movies major themes is what place if any feelings have in guiding actions.This comes into play in broad strokes as cities are attacked in ways that echo todays terrorists. And more telling with a great deal of intimacy as the crew comes to each others aid. Pine and especially Quinto expose much deeper layers of the complex bond between Kirk and Spock. So intensely personal does it become you may find yourself moved in unexpected ways. In this way ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" really does boldly go where no man has gone before.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--------------------------------Star Trek Into DarknessMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violenceRunning time 2 hours 12 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Action (Movie Genre) Entertainment Movies Star Trek into Darkness (movie) Unrest Conflicts and War J.J.

Abrams gets it. The director and his star fleet of writers and actors proved that with 2009s rousing humorous ""Star Trek."" That adventure breathed relevant but not too hagiographic life into a beloved (to put it mildly) 1960s television sci-fi adventure series. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" penned by Robert Orci Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof continues to honor the deep tug of Gene Roddenberrys iconic collection of characters Capt. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) first officer Spock (Zachary Quinto) Chekov Sulu Bones and Scotty (Simon Pegg in fine surly form) -- and Zoe Saldanas astute and foxy Uhura. If the 2009 film reintroduced audiences to a crew in the making this outing plunges them -- and us -- into the greatly amped action. Amid terrible explosions and fierce fire fights friendship loyalty personal ethics and Starfleet protocol will be tested. There continues to be something touching in the ideal of divergent personalities uniting in -- and quibbling throughout -- adventures in discovery of new worlds but also of self. ""Into Darkness"" which opened Wednesday begins on a planet on the verge of volcanic cataclysm. The prime directive of not getting mixed up in another worlds beeswax is being ignored -- as it was throughout Kirks service to Starfleet. The white-painted natives of Nibiru will get an eyeful when the Enterprise bursts from watery depths and high-tails it toward space. (This isnt the last time the Enterprise will crest magnificently out of the elements. ) Kirk is as headstrong as ever. Though Pine does an able job showing fissures in the good captains certainty. When Kirk ignores rules for the slightly more tricky value of loyalty he takes a hit. Returning as Adm. Christopher Pike Bruce Greenwood defends but also chastises the cocksure officer. And Spock ever the rationalist has a hand in his comeuppance. Spock and Kirks still-evolving relationship and the tensions between fealty and code provide a worthy set-up to the story of what happens when one of Starfleets own attacks it. What an intelligent foe the movie has in John Harrison. Played with brooding intensity by Benedict Cumberbatch his superlative smarts and commensurate strength make him more than formidable. The British actor brings an intelligent authority and seductive reasoning to the character which makes Kirks prickly alliance with him believable. The 3-D here feels more a matter of studio bottom lines and moviegoers tastes than essential to the experience. More interesting visually is the fact that after Christopher Nolan showed Abrams IMAX images from ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Abrams and cinematographer Dan Mindel decided to shoot portions of ""Into Darkness"" in that bold format. Ill see it again on that ride alone. ""Into Darkness"" is not as winkingly fun as its Abrams predecessor. How could it be? Harrison is too deft and devastating an adversary for that. Hes a disarming monster with perfect frosty diction and a superior stare. For all its reckoning with mass destruction this franchises vision of a future Earth remains optimistic. The film mixes the iconically familiar with the futuristic. A San Francisco trolley car shares the frame with an advanced powered vehicle.

Caption From the TV show that sparked the franchise in 1966 to four spinoffs and an animated series 12 movies and multiple Captain Kirks heres a look at the long and prosperous voyage. -- Michael Cavna Launched In September 1966 show ""captain"" Gene Roddenberry launches the voyages of the starship Enterprise with his new sci-fi adventure TV series ""Star Trek"" starring William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy as the perfectly complementary Kirk and Spock and DeForest Kelley as Bones. NBC Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday May 14 2013 Follow AnnHornaday The nervy reboot of the ""Star Trek"" franchise by action impresario J.J. Abrams can be summed up quite simply as a triumph of casting. From the moment Chris Pine Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana showed up in Abramss ""Star Trek"" four years ago it was clear that he had found exactly the right actors to portray captain James Kirk first officer Spock and communications officer Uhura in their years as Star Fleet rookies. Bright bold playful and ingenious Abramss prequel to the classic 1960s television show (and subsequent film series) possessed equal amounts of respect and cheek. But mostly it boasted an ensemble of superb young actors who with every raised eyebrow and vocal inflection inhabited their characters with uncanny ease and seamless physical mimicry. With ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" Abrams proves that hes still got the golden touch. The USS Enterprise crew is back -- including ship doctor ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) chief engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg) Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Sulu (John Cho). But the casting coup here is Benedict Cumberbatch who exudes steely resolve and silken savagery as a villain on the cusp of becoming a legendary nemesis. Familiar to fans of another reboot -- ""Sherlock"" -- as well as tony historical productions such as ""War Horse"" and ""Atonement"" here Cumberbatch claims a deserved place front and center in a big brash popcorn movie. As gratifying as it is to watch Kirk Spock and their colleagues develop the camaraderie that would so optimistically anticipate a multicultural world ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" derives its ballast and most of its menacing pleasure from Cumberbatch who takes tantalizing ownership of a role with near-limitless future prospects for evil mayhem. It seems like just yesterday we were watching the Mandarin lay waste to Los Angeles in ""Iron Man 3."" Now its 23rd-century London where a Star Fleet archive has been sabotaged by a mysterious doctor named Harrison (Cumberbatch). Back at headquarters in San Francisco Kirk is tomcatting around and getting into trouble for getting cocky during a mission on the planet Nibiru -- a risky maneuver involving a volcano and a narrow escape that opens ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" Called on the carpet by his mentor Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) Kirk is busted back to the Academy. But soon hell be back on the Enterprise heading toward the Klingon home planet of Kronos and apprehending Harrison before his interstellar terrorism goes any further. In a post-Abbottabad world its easy to see every summer action movie about an attack and a manhunt as a modern-day political allegory. For its part ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" contains debates about weaponizing the Enterprise and unilateral assassinations that cant help but echo current arguments about due process and drone strikes. As intriguing as these parallels are though the best parts of ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" are purely escapist and sensory from its bright primary-colored palette and playroom-like production design to the lens flares and blown-out bursts of light that cheerfully belie the films title. Filmed in IMAX (yay) and tweaked for 3-D (boo) ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" banishes at least for the moment the lugubrious mood and sepulchral look that too many comic-book movies mistake for sophistication. All hail an action film that isnt ashamed to have fun and to be seen doing it in the dazzling light of day. Nor is ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" afraid to shed a few tears. This is a get-out-your-mankerchief movie with Spock struggling with his Vulcanized (and thus repressed) feelings Kirk struggling with his friendship with Spock and Bones dismissing all of it with his signature gruff fulminations (""Im a doctor damn it""). A distressing climactic moment of physical brutality notwithstanding ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" skillfully advances the characters emotional arcs their inner lives and foibles dovetailing with the galactic explorations theyve embarked on in the wider world. Once again theres real acting going on behind those campy outfits and absurd gadgets One look at Quintos face during an early pivotal encounter with Kirk reveals the subtle ripples of expression that can be found in no-expression. 1 of 31 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Summer movie guide 2013 View Photos Catastrophes superheroes sequels -- the months ahead have it all.

Chris Gallettas hilarious heartfelt script could turn this little dramedy into the breakout indie hit of the summer. A cast filled with established comedians such as Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally plus fresh talent including Arias (looking like the next Zach Galifianakis) provides plenty of laughs. CBS Films Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. With every element so clearly put in place and the ""Star Trek"" vernacular so lovingly preserved and elaborated the biggest challenge facing the filmmakers -- especially screenwriters Roberto Orci Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof -- is to make sure that subsequent stories deepen what they have built rather than just pile on more effects and stunts. Thankfully ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" leaves the hatch open to countless possibilities whether brand-new story lines or visits to familiar faces and places from the past. With the franchise now securely underway its reassuring to know that Abrams and his team have the con. Star Trek Into Darkness Three stars.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Zade Rosenthal) Star Trek Star Trek Into Darkness achieves liftoff By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams May 15 2013 (...) Paramount Pictures Zachary Quinto stars as Spock and Chris Pine stars as James T. Kirk in Paramount Pictures Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) Handout Chris Pine Zoe Saldana and Zachary Quinto in a scene from ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" Paramount Pictures Zachary Quinto stars as Spock in Paramount Pictures Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) Zade Rosenthal This undated publicity film image released by Paramount Pictures shows from left Zachary Quinto as Spock Benedict Cumberbatch as John Harrison and Chris Pine as Kirk in a scene in the movie ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" from Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions. (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Zade Rosenthal) Expecting a ""Star Trek"" sequel to boldly go where no movie has gone before would be highly illogical. Although director J.J. Abrams took four years to map a follow-up to the 2009 revival of the sci-fi franchise the steady helmsman stayed on course. Like its entertaining predecessor ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" offers much of what the fans expect and not much of what they dont. This character-driven vehicle is a supercharged example of cinematic craftsmanship.The character in command of course is Capt. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) a brash young Star Fleet officer.His latest violation of protocol is revealing his 24th-century spaceship to the Stone Age inhabitants of a newly explored planet called Nibiru thus potentially altering their evolution. As usual the cocky captain has a good reason for breaking the rules -- something about saving the life of half-Vulcan science officer Spock (Zachary Quinto) -- but its not enough to keep Kirk from being briefly demoted. Yet soon he is given a crucial assignment capture a traitor named Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who killed one of Kirks closest allies before fleeing to the Klingon planet of Kronos. When comic-relief Scotty (Simon Pegg) balks at the militaristic nature of the mission Chekov (Anton Yelchin) inherits the red shirt of the engineer and the crew gets a mysterious new member (Alice Eve) who may know more about the super-human Harrison than she admits.Like any good ""Star Trek"" story this one raises timeless questions about the nature of good and evil but not at the expense of entertainment value or character development.Spock gets a lot of face time in this one to develop his romance with the Klingon-fluent Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and his bromance with Kirk whom he dares to call a friend in the movies emotional crescendo. And there are plenty of check-listed elements -- including a troublesome tribble -- from the original TV series and subsequent movies. Yet Abrams has upped the pace and production detail like a warp-speed Spielberg. The sorcerers apprentice begins this 3-D release with a knowing nod to Indiana Jones and never loses control of the reins.In our cynical stardate its rare for a popcorn movie to deliver on its promises but ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a generous enterprise.

Not the one with Pope Francis and the Argentine torture scandals; I heard about that. Im talking about the high-level secret meeting in the super-secret sub-orbital space fortress where J.J. Abrams was elected sole curator conservator and monarch of three generations worth of nerdy pop culture history. Seriously people how does one guy end up in charge of both the ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" reboots? Give me a break Isnt that kind of nuts and megalomaniacal and wrong and just too much of the same flavor of peppermint hazelnut chip ice cream from that one summer in Connecticut when ""Alligator Woman"" was on the radio every single day? (We can discuss this another time but if I could create a world in which Joss Whedon had taken on ""Star Trek"" and given Abrams the freakin ""Avengers"" Id do it in a heartbeat.)Ive got nothing against J.J. Abrams. Hes got verve and enthusiasm and considerable technical ability and amid the hackwork that underlies so much of big-budget film and TV that stands out. I have generally enjoyed his work over the years although if you pressed me Id probably express the snobby opinion that its all been very slightly downhill since ""Felicity"" and ""Alibi."" I thought about becoming a big fan of ""Lost"" and sort of meant to but then I noticed that I wasnt getting any younger and there were lots of other things to pay attention to and also that the show had patches of remarkable dumbness. ""Super 8"" was super fun two summers back but also conveyed the odd sensation that Abrams lacked any artistic personality of his own so he had flayed Steven Spielberg and was wearing his skin like an Aztec sacrificial priest.But if youre a fan of either ""Star Trek"" or ""Star Wars"" or both you dont need me to deal you that theyre very different universes with divergent and often warring realms of fandom. (You ""both"" people What the hell is wrong with you? Are you Episcopalians? Do you use both Android and iOS depending on day of the week? Do you root for both the Yankees and the Red Sox because both cities are kinda cool?) Abrams infamous comments that he was never much of a ""Star Trek"" fan - ""It always felt too philosophical to me"" he recently told Jon Stewart - made it seem as if hes been using the second-most-popular science-fiction franchise of all time as a placeholder while waiting for the gig he really wanted the one without all that boring philosophy to open up. Next up Abrams plans remakes of ""Jaws"" and ""The Godfather"" and ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""The Exorcist"" all made slightly too jovial and with gratuitous lens-flare. (OK thats not true at least not yet.)So thats an admittedly long-winded way of working my way around to the question of whats wrong (and right) with ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" Abrams splashy and largely agreeable mega-budget sequel to his 2009 ""Star Trek"" reboot. As ""Trek"" buffs already understand - and have furiously debated for the last four years - this reboot features Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto who is terrific) and Capt. Kirk (Chris Pine who is um not terrific) but is set not in the universe of Gene Roddenberrys original TV show and subsequent films but in an alternate timeline often dubbed the ""Abramsverse"" (though in fact its mostly the work of screenwriter Roberto Orci). This alternate universe features many of the same characters and a roughly similar reality but all kinds of stuff is different and wildly inconsistent from the size of the starships (many times larger) to the existence of many previously unknown alien races to the fact that Jim Kirk can drive a stick-shift. (You think Im kidding) If youre really interested go study the intensely detailed work of Bernd Schneider at Ex Astris Scientia but I can summarize The Abramsverse is considered canonical by hardcore fans only because they have no choice; its ""Trek""-flavored but largely made-up and WTF.To extend the metaphor still further the Abrams ""Star Trek"" movies feel as if they didnt just depict an alternate universe but were created in one - a universe in which the original ""Star Trek"" was an action-adventure Marvel Comics title rather than a geeky Enlightenment-saturated 1960s TV series. Start with that idea and you can make sense of almost everything about ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" There are the pumped-up gym-toned physiques of Kirk Spock Lt. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and everybody else and the cutting-edge synthetic fabrics that make the whole thing resemble a 23rd-century workout video. There are the often spectacular and just as often nonsensical CGI outer-space action sequences (I saw this in IMAX 3-D and it looked terrific). Theres the dumbed-down dialogue - not Spocks in fairness -- and the incoherent scheming of Benedict Cumberbatchs super-soldier ultra-villain a compelling presence who turns out depressingly to be kind of an idiot. You Might Also Like Yes its true that Abrams and writers Orci Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof have reinvented one of the most feared and revered villains from the original ""Trek"" universe and have also worked a neat inversion on a key plot twist from the most beloved of the ""Trek"" movies. (Lets leave it there for now shall we?) There are references and in-jokes aplenty for ""Star Trek"" fans but lets be honest Thats probably 10 percent of the target audience and ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" never even tries to feel like an ""old-continuity"" ""Trek"" fiction. This is a brawny mass-audience popcorn-transmission vehicle pretty much in the vein of Whedons ""Avengers"" and Shane Blacks ""Iron Man 3"" and possibly not quite as successful as either. Its made with verve and gusto - some of the outer-space shots are among the most beautiful to be found in the genre -- and an entirely predictable formula. It throws in a few winks at the ""Star Trek"" nerds in the same obligatory way it slaps a veneer of post-9/11 apocalyptic sobriety on its plot. (Im getting pretty sick of that one honestly.)After an eye-popping but ultimately irrelevant prelude in which Kirk violates the Prime Directive in order to save Spock from the crater of an erupting volcano and suffers a temporary career setback Starfleet offices in London and San Francisco - which evidently have crappy security or none at all -- come under attack from the renegade secret agent played by Cumberbatch. After a lot of action-movie roaring and smirking and blam-blam-blam Kirk gets his captains chair back and heals his rift with his overly honest Vulcan senior officer but only because Starfleets commander Adm. Marcus (the leathery Peter Weller) is sending them to the Klingon homeworld armed with a bunch of super-secret photon torpedoes - all to kill one guy at the risk of starting a catastrophic war. Cough-cough-Osama-cough. Theres a lot of good material in the excitingly paced first half especially the ""Starship Troopers""-style suggestion that the Federation is being perverted into an expansionist military empire while its citizens arent paying attention. Hmm whered they come up with that crazy idea? Production design never fails to look great but the plot switchbacks become increasingly obvious as the movie plods on and despite Cumberbatchs abundant charisma the writers deliberately avoid twisting the characters samey invincible permanently pissed-off supervillain-ness in any interesting directions. One of the biggest differences ""Trek"" buffs have noted between the Abramsverse and the ""Prime Universe"" is the disappearance of moral cost and consequence (as in the destruction of Vulcan in the 2009 film). Here we see an enormous terrorist attack many times bigger than 9/11 which comes and goes as a plot element and is mentioned again.Theres absolutely nothing wrong with ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" - once you understand it as a generic comic-book-style summer flick faintly inspired by some half-forgotten boomer culture thing. (Heres something to appreciate about Abrams This is a classic PG-13 picture with little or no sex or swearing but one that never condescends.) Thats the way almost everyone will experience it and fair enough. Still if you feel like bitching about it come on over. Well crack a couple of watery brews and complain (in Klingon) about Uhuras ill-fitting romance with Spock or Chris Pines frat-boy weightlifter Kirk who completely lacks the air of provincial semi-educated suavity that made William Shatner the greatest bad actor in TV history. Or the fact that those in charge of the ""Star Trek"" universe could have entrusted its rebirth to someone who actually liked it. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Abrams Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence Running time 2 hours 12 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times) In English (and Klingon with English subtitles)The Quick HitJ.J. Abrams second ""Star Trek"" movie is chock-full of goodies but by the last quarter the action is so inflated and relentless that its like an anvil chorus played on your head. Grade B Mae West said ""Too much of a good thing is wonderful"" but ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" proves her wrong. Director J.J. Abrams second adventure with the crew of the Starship Enterprise revolves around a bad guy who looks like a normal Starfleet agent but is superhuman in his powers and subhuman or at least monstrous in his willingness to annihilate any species inferior to him and his kind. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is chock-full of goodies inventive exciting set pieces uproarious face-offs between Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock and amusing riffs on older movie hits and cults. But like its villain it doesnt know when to stop. You may find yourself going from loving it to liking it to becoming a wee bit tired of it - thats how relentlessly Abrams and his writers Damon Lindelof and the team of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman keep upping the scale of their cliff-hanging subplots and destruction fantasies. By the final half-hour the only thing that saves a climax from becoming an anti-climax is the weight and size of what soars through space or falls from the sky. The box-office prospects are rosy but if the series keeps hurtling in this direction the artistic forecast is mostly cloudy with a 90 percent chance of shrapnel. Fans will embrace it but the thundering music and sound effects and the dreadnought escalation will leave some audiences IMAXed out. Its hard to get your land legs back after this movie; you have to decompress. Abrams is a master at juggling pop heroes and heroines. His exhilarating opening sequence re-introduces Zachary Quinto as Spock Chris Pine as Kirk Zoe Saldana as Uhura Karl Urban as Bones and Simon Pegg as Scotty - in all their quirky glory. Before the heavy engineering of the main action kicks in Abrams and company ignite some cheeky fun imagining what it would be like for the Enterprise to hide underwater or for a Starfleet officer to lower himself into an active volcano (he looks like hes wearing a future Iron Man suit) or for a primitive planet to catch a glimpse of a space vehicle. A chase between that planets mud people and two Starfleet officers in disguise is as vivid as a summer-camp color war on acid. In the smart playful J.J. Abrams manner the movie nods and winks at the pop culture of several earlier ""Star Trek"" eras. The opening sequence offers a spin on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid leaping off a cliff as well as a twist on ""In Search of Ancient Astronauts."" It also swiftly etches in the push-pull dynamics between Pines risk-taking jocular sentimental Kirk and Quintos fastidious oddly boyish Spock who is equally rebellious in a subtler way. The movie mostly keeps its sense of humor. The script gives Urbans Bones as many corny turns of phrase as an intergalactic Dan Rather. Peggs excitable Scotty uses a tiny mute alien - who wears his brains on the outside of his head - as an unlikely straight man. And Saldanas Uhura can be comically intense. She seethes with passion and sometimes irritation as she tries to get her romance with Spock to work even when he accents his cerebral Vulcan side. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" starts living up to its title when renegade Starfleet agent John Harrison sets up a murderous explosion in London and a flying gunship ambush of Starfleets top command in San Francisco. (It resembles the chopper ambush of the Mafia bosses in ""The Godfather Part III."") Harrison goes into hiding on ""the Klingon homeworld of QonoS."" Since the Starfleet is on the verge of war with the Klingon Empire Kirk must command the Enterprise on a secret mission to corner and kill Harrison. Harrison mingles brute strength and surgical fighting skills with magnificent enunciation. After all hes played by the BBCs current Sherlock Benedict Cumberbatch who pulls off the role with power to spare. Its funny and scary to see Kirk punch himself out while trying to pummel Harrison - in that scene Kirk is like Angie Dickinson in ""Point Blank"" who ends up slapping herself silly when she takes on Lee Marvin. But Harrison is too one-note to be a great bad guy. Without giving anything away lets say that hes really the prelude to a glorious arch-villain. The challenge of filmmakers drawing on old TV series or comic books is to retain the casual pleasures that those forms provided every week or every month with the scale and dimensions - well pretensions - of a contemporary blockbuster. Abrams meets the challenge halfway. Individual scenes contain small miracles of logistics and timing. Even better Abrams treats every returning cast member as a luminary and gives each one a star turn. (The best may go to John Chos super-competent Sulu who displays lethal instincts when he briefly takes command.) But as Abrams and the writers pump up the action they show signs of strain - at roughly the hundred-minute mark. They want the movie to echo Americas reactions to 9/11 and they do it with an amped-up digital sledgehammer. (The closing credits dedicate the film ""to our post-9/11 veterans with gratitude for their inspired service abroad and continued leadership at home"" and the movie itself warns against trumped-up wars.) It isnt solely the hyped-up sound and imagery but also the thudding ambition that make you think someone is dropping an anvil on your head.

"Star Trek beams into the heart of Darkness review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesStar Trek beams into the heart of Darkness reviewJ. J. Abrams shoots off in as many directions as he can with Star Trek Into Darkness -- but great characters pull it all together. By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. May 15 2013Star Trek Into DarknessStarring Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Benedict Cumberbatch Simon Pegg Karl Urban Zoe Saldana John Cho Alice Eve Bruce Greenwood and Peter Weller. Directed by J.J. Abrams. 132 minutes. Opens May 16 at major theatres. PGNo one could say that Star Trek into Darkness doesnt give you bang for your buck.It crams almost a TV seasons worth of events into a single frantic movie an observation I make more as admiration than complaint. You barely get a chance to catch a breath as this saga takes off like a starship and just keeps going from its Indiana Jones-style opening to its cosmos-rattling finale. And all in 3D no less.Article Continued BelowAfter the relatively simple origin story of his first Star Trek prequel of 2009 director/producer J. J. Abrams seems eager to shoot off in as many directions and cliffhanger subplots as he can -- and that includes an actual leap off a cliff. There are frequent hat-tips to familiar characters and incidents from the original 1960s TV series some serious and others played for laughs.Capt. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his loyal crew of the Enterprise ping-pong all over the galaxy finding adventure wherever they roam on a primitive jungle world on a Klingon base near the moons of Jupiter and even in 23rd-century San Francisco and London back on good ol Earth.Theres at least one moment in the spotlight for each of the familiar and returning crew members Kirk Spock (Zachary Quinto) Scotty (Simon Pegg) Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) Uhura (Zoe Saldana) Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) along with new hire Carol Marcus a weapons specialist played by Alice Eve.And dont forget Bruce Greenwoods Captain Pike back to offer more fatherly scolding to his rule-breaking protege Kirk. They both have to pay heed to another new character Peter Wellers take-no-prisoners Starfleet Admiral Marcus. Youd have to do a Vulcan mind meld with director/producer J.J. Abrams to completely follow his reasoning for this all-in approach. It could be as simple as the addition of Damon Lindelof to the writing duo of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman Lindelof having shown from Prometheus and TVs Lost that hed sooner tell a dozen stories than just one. (For Into Darkness he works in a very clever tip to Prometheus that sharp-eyed viewers will enjoy.)Even more puzzling is Abrams continued and expanded use of blue lens flare a stylistic tic that was curious in the first film and is now downright annoying.He and his team have earned these indulgences though since the first prequel did such a solid job of introducing the new/old characters and establishing them as the younger versions of well-loved Star Trek figures.The new film develops the growing bond and frequent sparks between Kirk and Spock finding both drama and humour in the formers impulsiveness and situational ethics against the latters steadfast adherence to all things logical and truthful. Theres a noticeable maturity too in how Pine and Quinto approach their roles.But the masterstroke of Into Darkness is the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch the BBCs new Sherlock Holmes as the new galaxy-threatening super villain. Hes disaffected and dangerous former Starfleet ace John Harrison a terrorist whose true agenda is slowly revealed but whose callous disregard for human life is chilling. Cumberbatch plays Harrison as if hes the evil twin of Holmes. He coolly assesses every situation with an eye to maximizing his advantage and he uses deception whenever necessary. Hes the dark heart of Into Darkness and that symbolic connection with Joseph Conrads Heart of Darkness is duly noted. His presence is felt amongst the ping-ponging cast members even when hes not onscreen like Conrads Mr. Kurtz (or Francis Ford Coppolas Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now). Harrison is considered such a threat to the universe Kirk is given the controversial mandate from Admiral Marcus to have him removed with the proverbial extreme prejudice via torpedoes that a boldly going starship shouldnt be packing.This weaponizing of the peaceable Enterprise leads to ethical dilemmas that the film doesnt fully explore but you cant mistake the parallels between the 23rd-century war on terror and the ongoing 21st-century version of same.Its not like the film gives you much chance to ponder weighty matters. The prime directive is to entertain and it does so with brio. The pulse-raising action sequences include a chase between two starships and a death-defying space walk -- make that a space zoom -- where two men navigate an asteroid field with only spacesuits to protect them.My only serious quibble with Star Trek into Darkness is that so much of the plot revolves around situations where Kirk and his crew have to take matters into their hands and do something manually because the automatic function has failed. This gets almost laughable after a while.On the other hand Star Trek has always been more about the people than the machines as awesome as those machines may be. Humanity must always triumph over technology.To this concept Abrams and his crew remain rightly steadfast leaving us satisfied and looking forward to more adventures with Kirk Spock and the good starship Enterprise.Read more about Star TrekThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Abrams maiden Star Trek voyage in 2009 presented a best-case scenario for what weve come to call the franchise reboot a fast-paced and witty blockbuster with charm to win over newbies who dont know a tribble from a Gorn and enough inside-baseball references to please a good many diehard Trekkies. It felt old and new in the best possible sense.So whaddaya got for an encore? A fair amount of the same as it turns out. In Star Trek Into Darkness Abrams and his writers once again place more emphasis on characters than plotting which is frankly a little confusing and they have fun with the franchises vast mythology without becoming slavish to the conventioneer crowd.When Chris Pines Kirk is roused from a bedroom dalliance with two ladies who happen to have tails the moment nods to the characters age-old eclectic libido and economically suggests the central trait of this particular iteration The guys still got some growing up to do.Into Darkness gives him that crack at maturity and lets us revel in the callowness to be overcome. The core crisis involves a renegade Star Fleeter (Benedict Cumberbatch acting circles around most of his cast mates) who attacks the main office and leads the Enterprise crew into potentially catastrophic warfare with those pesky Klingons.The bad guy is a walking embodiment of Abrams eagerness to play with the ghosts of Treks past; I dont know if his identity would qualify as a spoiler at this point but its close enough to walk on the side of caution and I dont want any Trekkies storming my email bridge. More important for present purposes the trouble in Darkness points toward home. For all its kinetic spectacle Into Darkness is a distant cousin to the American paranoia films of the 1970s in which the enemy is a lot closer and better entrenched than anyone would like to think.With so much on its mind Into Darkness still works best on a moment-to-moment basis. Thats where the cast including Zachary Quintos Spock Zoe Saldanas Uhura Karl Urbans Bones and Simon Peggs Scotty finds its groove and where Abrams walks right up to the edge of glib without jumping over. These movies take great pleasure in verbal jousting the give-and-take of contentious young adults with egos to navigate and a job to do. Sure that job happens to be saving the universe but that doesnt mean theres no fun allowed.Despite its name Into Darkness has more zip than the average summer money machine. It demonstrates the difference between self-awareness and self-seriousness. Core fans are the only ones who might get nod-and-wink fatigue but this doesnt really seem fair Star Trek has so many TV and movie iterations to draw on that no film version in our contemporary pop-culture-mad world can possibly exist in a vacuum.Abrams sophomore effort picks its references well builds on the relationships established in the original series (and tweaked in the last movie) and keeps the quips and battles coming.

The answer is Khan. And thats not a spoiler--its a selling point. A less secretive director (i.e. all save the ghost of Stanley Kubrick) would trumpet that his 185 million movie stars Star Treks greatest villain but J.J. Abrams has so suppressed this fact that I suspect if you rearrange the letters in Khan Noonien Singh youll find the location of the Lost island. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Abrams mystery-box marketing gave a boost to weaker cheaper films like Cloverfield and Super 8 but if Star Trek Into Darkness bombs the trick is on him. Cumberbatch a tweedy Brit with an M.A. in Classical Acting and a face like a monstrous Timothy Dalton has beefed up to become a convincing killer. Hes brutal and bold and the film around him isnt bad either. In the opening minutes Khan terrorizes London then makes like Osama and flees to the mountains of an enemy planet causing Starfleet Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller--welcome back RoboCop) to make like Dubya and order his assassination sans trial. Picture Zero Dark Thirty with bright pullovers and laser guns and youll have Darkness whose heavy-handed political parallels just might feel smart in a summer of Vin Diesel crashing cars.Instead of Jessica Chastains overrated ice queen vengeance here will be served by the blubbering James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) who so bleeds his humanity across the Enterprises deck that its a wonder Chekov (Anton Yelchin) doesnt slip. Again the central conflict is between the captains swaggering impetuousness and the cold-blooded logic of First Mate Spock (Zachary Quinto). Even more than in the first film Quintos Spock is emotionally disjointed--even dangerous. In his first scene Spock sacrifices himself to preserve Starfleets Prime Directive. Kirk breaks the rules to save his life and Spock is furious which is to say he pens a memo of complaint. Demoted Kirk struggles to reconcile his feelings for his friend. ""Hed let you die"" cautions Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) while Spocks girlfriend Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is so enraged by her boyfriends death wish that she threatens to ""tear the bangs off his head.""Film Details Star Trek Into Darkness RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time123 min. Showing Today In1 Theater More Info Trailer After setting up its War on Terror allusions Star Trek Into Darkness becomes Paradise Lost in Space Its a battle for the good captains soul. Dispatched to Khans hideout Kirk is torn between Spocks wisdom and Admiral Marcuss war-mongering. Will he let his crew quit or die in his quest for justice? Can Khan destroy him simply by smashing his moral code? In Darkness darkest scene our hero beats a prisoner whos already surrendered. Its shocking stuff but Abramss screenwriters dont trust the popcorn audience to get their psychological implications. Instead they externalize Kirks turmoil by making him spend every second scene suffering unsolicited advice about what to do. That even his subordinates treat him like a passive sap neuters the character despite an early romp where he beds twin hotties with tails. His only real love is for the Enterprise that hermaphroditic ship shaped like three phalluses and a flattened boob.To validate his 2009 reboot Abrams worked in a space-time splice so Leonard Nimoy could cameo as old Spock or ""Spock Prime"" as though he specializes in overnight shipping. Ironically in 1982 Nimoy (who had already penned the bristling memoir I Am Not Spock) was so desperate to abandon starship that he only agreed to Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan when promised his character would die. Spock croaked but Nimoys Vulcan heart was so warmed by the fan agony that the actor returned to direct Star Trek III The Search for Spock and post-resurrection has clung to the franchise even titling his follow-up memoir I Am Spock. Today while William Shatner is sealed in his pop-culture terrarium chanting lounge covers of ""Space Oddity"" Nimoy returns again so that old Spock can advise young Spock on how to defeat Khan decades before the original Khan defeats the original Spock causing such a doubled-back crimp in the chronology that in our universe Wrath of Khan may now no longer exist. Thus freed Abrams lifts Khans climax thievery that will enrage the devout as it suggests the Star Trek saga is merely a game of Mad Libs into which he plugs characters and catastrophes.Hey why not? Trek diehards have long-since proven theyre impossible to satisfy. Instead Abrams glossy relaunch is tailored to fans who dont care for canon but know enough to grin when Dr. McCoy pokes a Tribble. Darkness is a cheery combo of classic catchphrases and young Hollywood heat like blond babe Alice Eve as a weapons expert who can only examine torpedoes in her underwear.Having crumpled up the franchise for kicks--not that Im complaining--Abrams wont have the chore of smoothing out the Enterprises future. Pine who may yet prove to be a leading man in the model of Harrison Ford will be pressed to return in sequels as will Saldana Quinto and Simon Peggs Scotty. (If the openly gay Quinto hasnt had the same big screen success as his co-stars I hope its because he sincerely prefers the theater.) But their intergalactic overlord will be in another universe entirely.

Abrams reverent re-invigorated re-boot of the franchiseZachary Quinto left and Chris Pine star in Star Trek Into Darkness which features superbly crafted action sequences and terrific performances that render it a cut above most summer blockbusters.(Photo Zade Rosenthal Paramount PIctures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of fourStars Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Benedict Cumberbatch Zoe Saldana Karl Urban Simon Pegg John ChoRated PG-13; Runtime 2 hours 12 minutes; Opens Wednesday on IMAX and Thursday nationwideStar Trek Into Darkness may be going not so boldly back to the archives but it serves up an exhilarating spectacle with noteworthy moments of intimacy.Spectacular special effects superbly crafted action sequences plenty of humor and terrific performances render it a cut above most summer blockbusters.Director J.J. Abrams sequel (   1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Wednesday on IMAX screens and Thursday nationwide) is only a jot less fresh than his 2009Star Trek and it continues to re-invigorate the 50-year-old franchise. Four years ago Abrams made being a Trekkie cool again. And with this follow-up the cool factor remains staunchly intact. Abrams knows just how much to reference and re-boot from the series and previous movies. Yet he also sets an exhilarating new course in this nimbly twisting feature which pays homage to 1982s Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan.STORY Abrams takes captains chair again for another TrekPREMIERE Spock and Kirk bondDARKNESS CLIP Harrison vs KirkMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYThough the focus is on fun theres a sense of grace amid the excitement. Familiar characters are injected with new life and theres renewed affection among them -- even a bromance.This gleeful adventure should please both hard-core fans and those unfamiliar with Gene Roddenberrys original mid-60s TV series. While densely plotted it manages to be both nostalgic and forward-looking. The adventure takes place in 2259 so the skylines of London and San Francisco look stunningly futuristic. But the uniforms aboard the starship Enterprise look strikingly similar to the mod styles from the iconic show.While the production design is vividly rendered the characters are the most enthralling aspect. The youthfully attractive and diverse crew members from 2009 return for this tale. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are spot-on as Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock respectively. Zoe Saldana as Officer Uhura makes a wonderfully feisty action heroine. Simon Peggs a delight as Scotty and Karl Urban is very funny as Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) attempts to formulate a plan to save Spocks life above the protests of Spock (Zachary Quinto) himself. Benedict Cumberbatch is a brilliant addition as John Harrison an elegant but sneering genetically enhanced rogue Starfleet officer. A top-notch villain he reveals a coiled menace beneath his glacial calm.The less said about the twisting plot here the greater the potential for viewer enjoyment. The USS Enterprise led by Kirk and first mate Spock is given a mission to nab a terrorist (Cumberbatch). In the process the crew encounters warlike Klingons starship malfunctions and internecine strife. Volcanic eruptions are thwarted buildings blow up and a great airborne mano-a-mano clash intensifies the excitement. A particularly suspenseful scene involves Kirk and Harrison donning jet packs and transferring to another ship under Scotts command.But though its exciting to see the vessel in intergalactic peril what makes the story surprisingly moving is the bond between Kirk and Spock as they risk their lives to save each other. (Though in a fit of pique Kirk snarls that hed like to rip the bangs off Spocks face.) The ever-logical half-Vulcan Spock taps into his rarely visible human emotions.The pace is whip-fast and the action thrilling. But more importantly justice vengeance and morality are explored intelligently as are the bonds of friendship.Balancing the venerated and the inventive Abrams is bound determined and likely to make Trekkies of us all. 339 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 29 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/13Z0jwlSummer Movies Calendar MayTake a look at the films heading to the box office this May complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

Abrams revitalized ""Star Trek"" four years ago the reboot was such a clever re-imagining of the moribund franchise that it caught Trekkers and casual fans alike by surprise. The result was a film that in hindsight was a touch overpraised.Abrams sequel ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is not going to sneak up on anyone arriving in theaters with the baggage of high expectations. Without that element of gleeful surprise ""Darkness"" may end up a movie that is underpraised -- even though it may be a better piece of filmmaking than Abrams first venture into creator Gene Roddenberrys world. The actors are now more comfortable with their characters the film is beautifully crafted and theres a much stronger villain for the crew of the Enterprise to battle. At the same time it retains the first movies affection for the conventions of the ""Star Trek"" mythology -- without taking itself too seriously. (Left to right) Zachary Quinto is Spock and Chris Pine is Kirk in STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS from Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions. Zade Rosenthal/Paramount ( Photo credit Zade Rosenthal ) The story cooked up this time around by Abrams and writers Damon Lindelof (""Lost"") and Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (""Fringe"") will be familiar to ""Trek"" devotees while still feeling original. The plot which Abrams plunges into without much setup involves a one-man terrorist attack on Starfleet beginning with an explosion that rips apart a top-secret war room in London dedicated to preparation for a possible war with the Klingon Empire. The one-man wrecking machine is a rogue Starfleet agent named ""John Harrison"" (Benedict Cumberbatch of TVs ""Sherlock""). The worst-kept secret about the film is just who Harrison really is. I wont spoil it although anyone who can use a browser can easily find out.Advertisement When things get started the Enterprise is on a mission to the world of Nibiru. In a thrilling setpiece Captain James Kirk (Chris Pine) manages to violate all kinds of Starfleet regulations including the Prime Directive -- much to the dismay of first officer Spock (Zachary Quinto). As a result Kirk loses command of his ship although an attack by Harrison on fleet headquarters in San Francisco quickly changes that. On orders from the hawkish Admiral Marcus (sci-fi veteran Peter Weller) Kirk and the Enterprise are soon rocketing off in pursuit of Harrison -- even though it means chasing him into Klingon territory with orders to terminate with extreme prejudice (a moral challenge to more than a few crew members).The bulk of the film is the running battle between the Enterprise and Harrison a slippery fellow who at times almost convinces the crew and the audience that he really isnt the bad guy at all. At times the story doesnt really stand up to close scrutiny but Abrams keeps up such a ferocious pace that you probably wont notice.Still hes smart enough to find room for the small moments involving Kirk Spock and the other crew members. He is deft at giving each crew member a time to shine. For once Scotty (Simon Pegg) gets more to do than worry about whether the warp engines will come back online.Throughout Abrams treads a very thin line between satisfying Trekkers with inside references to past characters and incidents and making the film accessible to those with just a passing knowledge of ""Trek"" lore. For the most part he succeeds and even if you dont have a clue what Mudds war was all about you wont feel left out. Abrams gets considerable help from a cast who go after their roles with great zest. Cumberbatch -- all deadly glare and menace -- is wonderful as Harrison. Quinto gives a performance as Spock that manages to be both subtle and rather amusing. Pegg hijacks every scene hes in as Scotty. If theres a weak link in the cast its Pine who is OK as Kirk but never really seems to fully inhabit the character.Given everything that is on his plate including a reboot of the other great space opera ""Star Wars"" its unlikely Abrams will be back to direct the next ""Star Trek."" If thats the case lets hope hell pick a worthy successor because there still seems to be a lot of life left in the Enterprises mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.For film news and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS    Rating PG-13 (for sci-fi violence and intense images)Cast Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Zoe Saldana and Benedict CumberbatchDirector J.J.

"Star Trek Into Darkness movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Star Trek Into Darkness boldly goes where weve gone before but its fun voyage  1/2 Star Trek Into Darkness Chris Pine left and Zachary Quinto star in ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" Chris Pine left and Zachary Quinto star in ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Its lame and sort of geeky to compare franchise apples to oranges. Oh well. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" does everything ""Iron Man 3"" tries to do in the realm of global terrorism imagery reprocessed for popcorn kicks but with a little more style a dash more brio and invention.Yes the film culminates in a vicious fistfight that goes on slightly longer than forever. Yes its brazenly dependent on our collective (and justified) fond memories of the best of the first-round ""Star Trek"" movies ""Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan."" We wont say how exactly but it is. But the new film works. Its rousing. The human element and the Vulcan element to say nothing of various other species are present accounted for and taken seriously enough to matter. Director J.J. Abrams film arrives four years after his successful 2009 ""Star Trek"" reboot. The opening is straight out of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" Bam were on the ground of a Class M planet with Cmdr. James T. Kirk once again played by Chris Pine on the run from the locals while the digital volcano in the background threatens trouble.Life on Earth in the 23rd century involves much of the same peril as life outside the multiplex or Imax auditorium in the early 21st. A massively destructive act of terrorism sets into motion a tale that leads early on to an attack on Starfleet apparently from within; a test of leadership for Kirk; the introduction of a formidable adversary (Benedict Cumberbatch as the terror-monger with the plummy English vowel sounds); and a series of crises one might describe as ""relentless"" and ""scarcely unceasing"" if they werent generally effective. Abrams has a real knack for the cliffhanger; most action movies offer a series of insane life-and-death scrapes and in that regard ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" resembles most action movies. Yet Abrams varies the game. The various ""10 seconds to destruction"" scenarios generate real suspense. An ultrafast space flight with Kirk zipping through the nothingness trying to avoid getting clocked by orbiting space debris clearly was designed with the gamer in mind -- but the scene is tasty on its own as is the sequence in which our heroes must crash-land with split-millisecond timing onto a runway without writing themselves out of the next ""Star Trek"" movie.Zachary Quinto as Spock turns into the rock-em-sock-em Vulcan in Abrams latest. I think its a mistake; or rather I think the final 20 minutes or so grind on past their usefulness. But its not enough to kill the fun which is often exhilarating. Karl Urbans Bones McCoy; Zoe Saldana as Uhura; Anton Yelchin as Chekhov The 2009 gangs all here plus Alice Eve as a special guest passenger on the redesigned Enterprise (heavy on the reds). The ship looks like a trillion bucks.Abrams favors the extreme eyebrow-to-chin close-up in simple two-person dialogue scenes yet his camera has an unfashionable mobility in its favor which makes the entire thing breathe more easily. I liked the 2009 outing; I liked this one a tick more.Postscript Cumberbatchs way with ... a precise ... yet unexpected ... pause rivals that of Alan Rickman in the ""Harry Potter"" series. There is no higher compliment in the pause department. Those pauses when experienced in the Imax screen format really are pips. mjphillipstribune.comStar Trek Into Darkness -- 3 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence)Running time 212Opens Wednesday in Imax; Thursday in all other theaters Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Star Trek (movie 2009) Star Trek into Darkness (movie) Raiders of the Lost Ark (movie) Alice Eve Anton Yelchin J.J.

If you didnt see the original. Too easy if every time they get in a jam they can call past Spock to see what he did to help. What happened to letting them figure out there own path.And reversing the death scene. When it came to the important parts of the movie the writing slipped. All in all I give it a solid C+ for a rehash of an old movie and a B+ for a summer popcorn movie. I left the movie disappointed that I saw it 20 years ago. Brad Wrightsaid on Tuesday May 28 2013 62401 PMBut Fast amp; Furious 6 is an A-? This film had layers with characters storytelling and dedication to the original series. But Fast amp; Furious 6 is considered ""great"" to you because there is a lot of action and Vin Diesel. Wow... Jonathan Lemmonsaid on Sunday May 26 2013 41813 PMI wouldnt say Im unfamiliar with the Star Trek universe but I knew enough about it to know what I was getting myself into. With that being said I was blown away by both of J.J.s Star Trek movies This one especially. Star Trek Into Darkness has everything I look for in movies; action drama and a super scary bad guy. I thought Benedict Cumberbatch was one of the more terrifying villains of recent years. Hes up there with Tom Hardy as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. I feel that this movie deserves a much larger rating than a B. Seeing as you gave the 2009 Star Trek a B as well I was hoping youd see Into Darkness as a vast improvement over the first both action and story-wise. But I cant judge you on your opinion because that would be considered cynical so heres hoping that Star Trek 3 will be more to your liking the same way Iron Man 3 was which I personally didnt like as much as the first two. Josaid on Sunday May 19 2013 80826 PMThis was a strong movie from start to finish. B+ or A- but only because so much of it was homage to other movies/science fiction at the expense of a ""simple"" plot.

"Star Trek Into Darkness (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Star Trek Into Darkness (PG-13) Director J.J. Abrams wild unpredictable sci-fi adventure is the summers first true thrill ride. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/14/2013 Editor rating 3.5 Star Trek Into Darkness gives you an exhilarating tingle-inducing rush -- that rare feeling that comes when a gigantic entertainment is firing on all fronts exceeding your expectations. Having dutifully built a foundation that honored the past but left the future wide open in 2009s Star Trek director J.J. Abrams makes Gene Roddenberrys original creation his own sending these iconic characters on a breakneck-paced adventure that delivers the goods on both narrative and razzle-dazzle action levels. Working with his frequent stable of writers Roberto Orci Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof Abrams pushes Star Trek into new territory while keeping a nostalgic eye trained on what has come before. The set-up is simple A terrorist named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) a former Starfleet member detonates a bomb in London that kills hundreds. Although the USS Enterprise is supposed to be used primarily for scientific exploration Capt. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and the rest of his crew are ordered to perform a military mission Track down Harrison on the planet Kronos even if it means invading Klingon airspace which could be considered an act of war. Thats all the plot youll get here One of the things that distinguishes Star Trek Into Darkness from most of the previous movies in the franchise is the number of big surprises the story springs. Although Abrams never allows the picture to get too heavy or allegorical (this is also probably the funniest Trek movie ever) the story raises the kind of moral and ethical quandaries that would have made Roddenberry proud. If the fate of a dear friend is in the balance should you risk altering the natural destiny of a primitive planet by giving them a glimpse of future technology? If you suspect someone is planning to attack you do you have the right to a pre-emptive strike even though you could be wrong? Is it ever proper to break the law or even commit murder for the sake of maintaining the greater peace? Kirk and his logic-bound first officer Spock (Zachary Quinto) spend a lot of time debating these issues sometimes with dire consequences. Spock also has trouble with girlfriend Lt. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) who doesnt think he gives their relationship enough weight. Engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg) gets in trouble when he disobeys a direct order but he is later rewarded with a critical role in one of the movies most exciting setpieces. Lt. Sulu (John Cho) gets a chance to sit in the captains chair and medical officer Bones (Karl Urban) used mostly for comic relief continues to go around spouting ""Dammit Jim."" Only Chekov (Anton Yelchin) seems wasted this time spending much of the movie running around the bowels of the ship making repairs. The attention to characters and their overlapping relationships is what gives Star Trek Into Darkness its heart (and the movie contains some unexpectedly moving moments; bring tissues). The cast having bonded over the first film work together as well as a troupe of trapeze artists This is a true ensemble. But it is Abrams who has brought all his previous experience (Mission Impossible III Super 8 TVs Alias) to bear on the picture who is the real star here. He has the enthusiasm of a fan a thorough grasp of storytelling and a superb command of craftsmanship and style (he also throws in so many of his beloved lens flares you could play a drinking game every time one shows up - in 3D too). The films 15-minute prologue set on a planet covered with red trees gives you a taste of what Abrams take on the next Star Wars (due in 2015) will feel like. The rest of Star Trek Into Darkness (which was shot with IMAX cameras and deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible) is Trek through and through doling out a seemingly unresolvable cliffhanger every 20 minutes inserting fresh wrinkles into familiar tactics (a chase through warp speed) and paying homage both subtle and overt to previous Star Trek lore. Diehard fans may be a bit rankled by how Abrams dares to tinker with canon but the end result is worth it. Forget Iron Man 3 The summers first true thrill ride has arrived.

The shows racially mixed crew and explore-strange-new-worlds wonderment gave a society at odds over skin color politics and an ever-broadening role in foreign cultures a number of idealistic goals to strive for--to go boldly forth not only outward but inward. Gene Roddenberrys overarching vision (utopian to a fault) has persisted through most Trek incarnations; even when Klingons or the Borg attacked you got the sense that the ultimate endgame was peace for all--that phasers would finally be sheathed and ""Live Long and Prosper"" salutes would prevail. How things have changed The second installment in J.J. Abrams amp; Co.s reboot of the Starship Enterprises continuing voyages is defined by a relentless simplistically solemn pall. At least the Abrams-helmed Star Trek from 2009 had a pretzel-logic playfulness; the portentously subtitled Into Darkness is attempting like hell to be a Trek for our troubled times. The franchise has been thoroughly Christopher Nolan-ized. The film opens with a bizarre pro-interventionist teaser sequence in which Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) willingly flouts the Starfleet prime directive to save both a primitive alien species and his volcano-stranded friend Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto). Kirks shrug-it-off insubordination should be familiar to anyone who knows the character but the consequences are distressingly ephemeral. Though the powers that be take away Kirks ship you can see a thats-my-boy glint in the eyes of our strapping heros superior and mentor Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). For all his jabber about following protocol its clear that Pike is enamored with this young hothead who doesnt play by the rules. The implication is that wed all be better off if more people would just say to hell with the repercussions and rush in with phasers blazing. Its not long afterward that a mysterious terrorist named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch blessedly lending shades to a warmongering cipher) wipes out a bunch of Starfleet heavyweights and Pikes unspoken wishes are given vengeful form. What was that about rescinding your captaincy Mr. Kirk? Never mind. Heres your ship. Heres your crew. (What up sexy proton-torpedo expert?) Lets roll As anyone whos watched Alias or Lost can tell you weightless melodramatics become House Abrams (his frequent collaborators Roberto Orci Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof coauthored this screenplay). Being foreboding and setting up smoky intrigue matter more than following through and when in doubt distract em with fan-pandering soap opera and spectacle. Its barely a secret that Into Darkness cribs many of its particulars from 1982s beloved second entry in the original film series The Wrath of Khan though the callbacks all seem desperate--anemic attempts by lesser artists to launch themselves out of creative corners by standing on the shoulders of their betters. (When Into Darkness dares to do a role-reversal replay of Khans most heartrending sequence it feels like sacrilege.) The crews many interpersonal tiffs meanwhile are pure histrionic filler despite the actors best efforts. (Quinto has truly made Spock his own--thank heaven for performative pleasures.) Plus the cliff-hanger scrapes though engaging in the moment have no lasting resonance. An impressive-looking action sequence involving two crew members flying through a space-debris field toward a very small air lock serves little purpose beyond its special-effects demo-reel sheen. Its not the first time Hollywood has churned out a vacuum of a blockbuster but theres something especially disconcerting about Into Darknesss hollowness given the visibly provocative content that in true Trek fashion is meant to put us in mind of our precarious present. A suicide bombing is shockingly bloodless treated like a mere plot-move-along pretext. Authority is ignored--and death is cheated--with zero character-deepening ramifications; theres nothing comparable to Spocks heroic sacrifice in Khan. Then theres the deadening finale in which Harrison flies a rogue starship into a bustling metropolis. In composition as well as in extras-plowing and building-toppling action it shamelessly calls to mind the terrible morning that two hijacked planes weaved their way into downtown Manhattan without ever earning the evocation. (Steven Spielbergs War of the Worlds--a similarly dour and destructive blockbuster--at least showed wrenching sympathy for lives lost.) By the time the film gallingly concludes with an onscreen dedication to our post-9/11 troops (I wish I were kidding) you want to boldly go somewhere all right...under a rock until a more empathetic and enlightened stardate comes around.

I really wish I hadnt its an abomination of a re-hash of various previous episodes of the original series and more recent films. There is nothing original or inspiring and it makes no sense to anyone who has seen those original episodes. If you are a Star Wars fan the action sequences are entertaining but JJ Abrams has no concept that Star Trek fans are in a different universe entirely and he is totally out of his depth. What a shame. FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 16 2013Maximus CleanFeaturedThis movie had it all which for a real Trekker like myself is hard to say for a sequel to a sequel. Brand name bad guy franchise villains a re-working of a classic death scene and some iconic lines spoken in an eerie deja-vu fashion makes this my favorite Star Trek movie of all time since Star Trek II. But then again if youve seen it youll realize its much the same and different at the same time. The original Khan was of Indian descent played by Latin Actor Ricardo Montalban. Not sure why an Englishman was chosen but Im willing to overlook that as the acting was incredible by all. I give this movie 5 out of 5.

That the new movie does so -- expertly exhilaratingly -- is a mark of director J.J. Abramss uncanny ease with modern Hollywood formulas. Theres a plot involving a past villain played by Benedict Cumberbatch but it takes a back seat to the sheer energy of the storytelling--the way the movie presses forward with a high-spirited wit and sense of purpose that makes other action extravaganzas look backward.

Mark Vancleave Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The warp drives on the USS Enterprise are as usual on the verge of meltdown in ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" Luckily the entertainment propulsion system for the sci-fi saga is roaring full throttle. The second entry in the revived franchise is a note-perfect blend of escapist fun and thought-provoking commentary ensemble drama comic relief daredevil action and senses-shattering spectacle. Director J.J. Abrams who recently was anointed the new master of the ""Star Wars"" empire leaves Gene Roddenberrys galaxy positioned to live very long and prosper like crazy. Despite its baleful title ""Into Darkness"" is fleet-footed and never far from a jovial wink at the audience. It opens with a stupendous chase sequence that out-Spielbergs ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Kirk (Chris Pine) and Bones (Karl Urban) hot-foot it through a weird/gorgeous scarlet forest. A primitive race of chalk-white primitives barrel after them flinging spears (the only use of 3-D that has caused me literally to jump out of my seat.) Piling emergency atop crisis Spock (Zachary Quinto) is trapped inside that ready-to-blow volcano on the horizon the second hand ticking toward its planet-obliterating explosion. Topside the sprinting duo hit the deadest of all possible dead ends. The multi-cliffhanger ends with multiple surprises and a sly punchline about the origins of fanboy culture. Here in a nutshell is the Abrams approach to blockbuster filmmaking. The sequence isnt a handful of undifferentiated characters amid a crushing concatenation of pyrotechnics. Its a series of cleverly engineered ""What next?"" moments with a surprising perfectly apt payoff. It is storytelling always the strongest attribute of the ""Star Trek"" tradition. Back on a 23rd-century Earth Kirk is in hot water. His crews heroic but forbidden interference with an alien culture earns him a suspension. His mentor Adm. Pike (Bruce Greenwood) strips the cocky beginner of his command and sends him back to the academy. But soon the service is in need of every able-bodied man. Starfleets London data archive is vaporized (or is it?) by a nefarious rogue officer (or was he?) named John Harrison (or is he?). English star Benedict Cumberbatch bringing the mandatory Old World pomposity to the villains role flees to the Klingon homeworld Kronos. Since a boots-on-the-ground strike force would turn the Federations Klingon cold war hot Adm. Marcus (Peter Weller) orders the Enterprise to launch missiles from a safe distance. The allusions to domestic terrorism and drone warfare add real-world resonance to the drama. Paramount Pictures John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch center) challenges Spock (Zachary Quinto left) and Kirk (Chris Pine) in ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" As Harrison Cumberbatch is a huge improvement over Eric Banas Nero the gale-force banshee villain of 2009s ""Star Trek."" Harrison is a daunting foe possessing icy intellect superhuman physical prowess and a psychologists eye for his adversaries weak spots as well as a menacing theatrically trained baritone. He taunts Kirk with his glacial disdain until the hothead snaps. When he discovers that Harrison isnt an opponent who can be defeated by a punch or three or 10 Kirk must rethink his strategy. He struggles to adapt to a murky moral dimension where evil deeds spring from understandable impulses and where the enemies of your enemies are possibly but not reliably your friends. As in last summers ""Avengers"" the main business of ""Into Darkness"" is to teach the series familiar characters a few lessons. Kirk the brash cadet who landed in the captains chair almost by accident is obliged to learn the qualities of leadership. Spock must understand that rule-bound robot logic doesnt cover every nuance of context-sensitive human life. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) must recognize that having a tongue as sharp as her beloved Spocks ears does not make her more persuasive. The romantic byplay of Spock and Uhura compliments the bickering bromance between Spock and Kirk which reaches a surprisingly affecting payoff. Without feeling over-packed the film contains a multiplex worth of standout action scenes all of which advance the story while boggling the mind. My favorite answers the question ""How do you travel a great distance between spacecraft without a shuttle or transporter beam?"" The sequence a callback to a bravura passage in the earlier ""Star Trek"" is hair-raising. Abrams and ace cinematographer Dan Mindel handle the special effects with a sure hand shooting as many of the sequences as possible with minimal computer trickery. A fistfight sequence aboard a speeding garbage scow attains a level of realism rarely seen thanks to most of it being filmed with real actors in real sunlight. The film isnt perfect. Michael Giacchinos score works overtime to let us know that Harrison is eeeeevil. New Enterprise science officer Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) strips down to her underwear in one brazenly gratuitous scene simply because she looks really good that way. Some might quibble about including a Tribble. I was captivated every moment. While building in myriad references to earlier ""Star Trek"" adventures ""Into Darkness"" feels like a summation of all the previous chapters.

(Photo / Zade Rosenthal Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions) by Steven Rea Inquirer Movie Critic Close icon Steven Rea Inquirer Movie Critic Star Trek Into Darkness answers a burning question for fans of the franchise What does James Tiberius Kirk do in his off-hours? Slideshow Star Trek hits warp speed with a sequel that soars Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Star Trek Into Darkness >> How about frolicking in bed with alien twin sisters - sisters with long devilish tails? If you blink youll miss the moment but its part of the reason J.J. Abrams sequel to his 2009 Star Trek reboot is so much fun. Sure intergalactic doom is imminent and sure the USS Enterprises bulkhead will be breached its warp-control crippled its snappy crew tossed this way and that in the face of Klingon assaults but the guy at the helm Captain Kirk - and Captain Abrams back as director and producer - knows how to have a good time. It says something about Star Treks place in the pop-cult firmament that after just one feature this new cast of Starfleet officers seems so familiar their return to the big screen (and even bigger IMAX screens) so welcome. Chris Pine blue-eyes beaming insubordinantly fits comfortably into the role of Kirk who finds himself in a bad place (no not that menage a trois) as Into Darkness gets rolling. Hes lied on an official Starfleet report violating a ""prime directive."" The admiralty has no choice but to relieve Kirk of his command. And so for a time Kirk is in the doghouse - a 23rd century doghouse. Earth looks like it does now if you happen to live in downtown Dubai. Towering spires shoot above the cityscapes. And terrorism is still rampant In a scene remindful of the latest Bond film Skyfall in which MI6 headquarters becomes the site of an embarrassing explosive siege Starfleets shimmering skycraper is seriously compromised by bombs and gunships. In fact civilization hasnt advanced all that much. The military is still using drones - and people are still debating the ethics of killing people (and other life forms) by remote control. But theres nothing remotely controlled about Star Trek Into Darkness screenplay and the way Abrams and his team deliver it. From the breakneck prologue situated on a ""class M"" volcanic planet inhabited by a primitive chalk-faced tribe to the third-act space walk that finds Kirk rocketing through the blackness in a streamlined silver suit the action is exhilarating the visual effects spectacular - and spectacularly realized. Inevitably there must be a power-mad villain (or two) but unlike Iron Man 3s bad guys and most other movie malevolents this one (or two) is accorded some respect. Benedict Cumberbatch the British thespian with the name out of Dickens is John Harrison a man with an agenda - and an arsenal of mysterious 300-year-old torpedos. The actor brings his theater-trained gravitas to the proceedings. Also new to Abrams Star Trek Alice Eve as the Enterprises visiting Science Officer Carol Marcus and Peter Weller as Robocop I mean as a top Starfleet commander bent on putting those hoary old enemy Klingons in their place no matter the price. And running around the bridge - and the engine room the transport room the medical bay - are the rebooted incarnations of Bones Scotty Sulu and Chekov played respectively by Karl Urban (with urgency) Simon Pegg (with comic urgency) John Cho (with helmsman-like efficiency) and Anton Yeltsin (with boyish pluck). Zachary Quinto is back as Spock the half-human/half-Vulcan First Officer. Ruled by logic hes the cool analytical opposite to Kirks hotheaded frat boy. And hes apparently reached a crisis point in his relationship with the ships beautiful communications officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana). ""Oh my God are you guys fighting?"" Kirk says to the brooding duo. ""What is that even like?"" And so Star Trek Into Darkness is about old friends flying off into the final frontier bickering and bruised but still boldly going where no man has gone before. And no Vulcan no tribble (the little furballs are back) and no alien twin sisters with devil tails either. Star Trek Into Darkness 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by J.J. Abrams.

Abrams ""Trek"" reboot now in its second installment puts 9/11 into the mix. If there was any sort of grace period where mainstream action movies thought that audiences werent ready to look at terrorism redressed as entertainment that moment has officially passed; ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" fulfills its title right here on Earth with the destruction of a building in London and attacks on skyscrapers in San Francisco. Those are only a few of the massive set pieces in the film and the movie is by no means a dreary and mournful examination of the effects of terror in the homeland. But they happen and theyre key to the story that Abrams and his writers are telling. Its a sign of Abrams skill as a filmmaker that the movie can travel to such dark places and still feel like an upbeat energizing and often very funny adventure. Also read Star Trek Into Darkness Early Reviews Are Mixed ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" begins with Capt. Kirk (Chris Pine) getting demoted to First Officer under Capt. Pike (Bruce Greenwood) after violating the Prime Directive in order to rescue Spock (Zachary Quinto) from a volcano. (Spock of course is such a stickler for the rules that he tells all in his report which contradicts Kirks whitewashing of the situation.) But all that changes when former Starfleet higher-up John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) blows up a building in London thats allegedly an archive but actually hides a top-secret facility. Starfleet protocol demands that captains and first officers meet with their admirals after such a breach and Harrison opens fire on Kirk and company as they strategize with Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) before teleporting himself onto a Klingon planet. Marcus sends a furious vendetta-hungry Kirk on a mission of revenge that will involve firing the experimental new photon torpedoes at Harrisons hiding place from the edge of Starfleet-controlled space. Spock of course counsels Kirk not to do anything that might start a war with the Klingons a war that Marcus thinks is inevitable no matter what happens. Everything past this point goes into spoiler territory but suffice it to say that the ensemble -- which also includes Zoe Saldana (Lt. Uhura) Karl Urban (Dr. McCoy) John Cho (Mr. Sulu) Anton Yelchin (Mr. Chekov) and Simon Pegg (Scotty) -- clicks just as well as they did last time with the addition of Alice Eve as Carol a science offer who may have an agenda of her own. Also read Star Trek Into Darkness Opens at Warp Speed at Overseas Box Office Cumberbatch makes a compelling villain and not only because the layers of his plan take a while to reveal themselves. The filmmakers are clearly going for something Hannibal Lecter-ish here -- he even plays mindgames with Kirk from inside a glass box -- and while Cumberbatch may not reach those heights of infamy hes enough of a threat to put real life-and-death consequences into play. One of the general strengths of ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" in fact is the feeling of high stakes and genuine threat which is exceedingly hard to pull off in any long-running franchise. As with the previous ""Trek"" incarnations its the chemistry of the team that goes a long way in making these movies work providing both the funniest moments (when they banter and disagree) and the most moving ones (when sacrifices are made). Abrams makes the movie look great (he obviously doesnt care if people make fun of his penchant for lens flares apparently) making this a film worth the extra bucks for 3D and IMAX. Granted the stereoscopic vision works best in the action sequences or in the vertiginous overhead shots of the city skyline of future San Francisco; its a little less appealing when hes shooting a conversation close up and a random nose pops in and out of the left side of the screen. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" continues Abrams gambit of retelling the ""Star Trek"" saga only slightly backward and upside down and some of his tampering with canon will no doubt solicit yowls from the usual corners of the internet. (Admittedly I felt a little cheated by writers Roberto Orci Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof indulging in a cake-and-eat-it ending but its not a deal-breaker.) The movie may not offer the jolts of surprise that its predecessor did -- no sequel can really -- but this new Enterprise remains exciting and compelling enough to make me want to follow it on any number of five-year missions.

Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The crew of the Enterprise match wits and brawn against a genetically superior foe. Rated PG-13 (Bloodless but intense violence; mild language) BOTTOM LINE Faster and funnier than the first episode though still trekking in the shadow of the originals. Increased in-jokes and a borrowed plotline may tickle some fans and irritate others. CAST Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Zoe Saldana Benedict Cumberbatch LENGTH 212 ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" says Mr. Spock in ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" Its a momentous line in the annals of Trekkie history and it comes right after Bones McCoys trademark ""Dammit man"" and Scottys insistence that he cannot guarantee the Starship Enterprises safety. This is a catchphrase cornucopia but sheesh -- were only five minutes into the movie For a series meant to inject fresh blood into a nearly 50-year-old franchise ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" leans even more heavily on the past than the 2009 reboot ""Star Trek."" Directed once again by J.J. Abrams though with increased confidence and muscle ""Into Darkness"" is fast and fun zipping along on all thrusters while everyone on the bridge settles comfortably into an agreeably lighthearted vibe (and into ever-slimmer outfits). On the path to reinvention however ""Into Darkness"" often feels like a step backward. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Its selling point is still an energetic young cast particularly Chris Pine as roguish Captain Kirk and Zachary Quinto as his logical alter-ego Mr. Spock. Spocks romance with Officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana) has progressed to the bickering stage -- men are from Vulcan -- while Kirk is ogling blond weapons expert Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) whose duties inevitably require disrobing. Karl Urbans pessimistic Bones and Simon Peggs harried Scotty remain the movies MVPs; John Chos Sulu and Anton Yelchins Chekovcq hover mostly in the background. Benedict Cumberbatch (the BBCs ""Sherlock"") sneers Britishly as genetically engineered terrorist John Harrison and at first he cuts an impressively ruthless figure. But Harrison too is a ghost from ""Star Trek"" past. When his true identity is revealed -- Ill pretend you havent Googled this -- its less a stunner than a letdown. Its also a reminder of how breezy this ""Trek"" feels compared with the grand operatic emotionally cathartic originals. ""Into Darkness"" does a fine job of carrying a venerable franchise into a flashy splashy new millennium. Its slightly empty at its core but thats a complaint that only a few old-guard fans are likely to make. The needs of the many must prevail. 218 MoviesStar Trek Into Darkness trailer advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT The crew of the Enterprise match wits and brawn against a genetically superior foe. RATING PG-13 (Bloodless but intense violence; mild language) CAST Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Zoe Saldana Benedict Cumberbatch LENGTH 212 434 VideoNewsdays 5 cant-miss summer movies BOTTOM LINE Faster and funnier than the first episode though still trekking in the shadow of the originals.

Abrams low-aiming entertainment the arrested adolescents of the starship Enterprise face off against Benedict Cumberbatchs suave terrorist By Richard Corliss May 13 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Paramount Pictures / Skydance Productions Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Those madcap galoots Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) are trying to escape a band of chalk-faced aboriginals on the Class-M planet Nibiru. Having broken a Starfleet rule by intervening in a prehistoric civilization they run for their lives like Bob Hope and Bing Crosby hightailing it out of Zanzibar after one of their schemes went kaflooey. Reaching a cliff with the natives in angry pursuit Jim and Bones leap desperately toward the water far below. Now theyre Butch and Sundance in every way except for yelling ""S--"" as they plummet to safety. Theyre just one Enterprise crew member short of being the Three Stooges. Actually Moe -- Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) -- is trapped nearby in an erupting volcano its spewing lava reminiscent of the kitsch special effects from the 1940 One Million B.C. but in 3-D and gaudy color. Kirk back on the Enterprise ignores another Starfleet dictum and flies into the inferno to rescue Spock; the primitive Nibirians gape at the spacecraft with the same perplexed wonder as the apes at the 2001 monolith. When the Enterprise returns to Earth Rear Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) demotes Kirk to Starfleet Academy and separates him from Spock. Pike might be an exasperated homeroom teacher forced to keep two troublemakers apart -- or a father regretting that he gave his reckless teen son the keys to the starship. (READ Can the new Star Trek Make Science Fiction Fun Again?) Any prequel series to a movie franchise is obliged to imagine younger versions of famous characters. We know from the Star Trek TV series spawned in 1966 by Gene Roddenberry and from the six subsequent feature films starring William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy that Kirk is the man of action Spock the half-Vulcan half-man of thought. J.J. Abrams applied that dichotomy to his 2009 Star Trek reboot and now to the first sequel to the prequel Star Trek Into Darkness. (Abrams has his plate full with revered sci-fi franchises. Disney has entrusted him with reviving Star Wars.) (READ Mary Pols review of J.J. Abrams 2009 Star Trek) The difference between the Roddenberry and Abrams Kirks This one has a severe case of arrested development. Hes always spoiling for a fight that might endanger his crew nay alter the fate of the universe. Not that Into Darkness doesnt provide bustling fun equal to its modest ambitions or that the script (by the writing duo of Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman and Abrams co-creator of Lost Damon Lindelof) doesnt find rich plunder in the maleficence of an early Star Trek villain. But with its emphasis on its heros adolescent anger the movie turns this venerable science-fiction series -- one that prided itself on addressing complex issues in a nuanced and mature fashion -- into its own kids version Star Trek Tiny Toons. At times the viewer is almost prodded to mutter ""Grow up"" When catastrophe reunites the crew members for one more mission we find the rest of them suffering growing pains as well. Spock whos hardly on speaking terms with Kirk after the Nibiru caper endures a puppy-love spat with Communications Officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana). Engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg) has a tiff with Kirk and decides to sit this voyage out though hell prove useful later. That leaves Ensign Chekov (Anton Yelchin) to keep the Enterprise from exploding midflight -- another case of a boy trying to do a mans job. Ships helmsman Sulu (John Cho) is not prominent enough to have a teething problem; he and Bones prowl the craft and work to keep their less stable colleagues out of trouble. (READ J.J. Abrams on making Super 8) The Enterprise also has a stowaway Carol Marcus (Alice Eve). Security must be lax under Kirks command especially as regarding a pretty blonde. Carol adds the requisite erotic tension -- actually sub-erotic since sexual interest is irrelevant in a boys-in-space epic. There was more sincere budding love in Abrams last film the excellent Super 8 in which four 12-year-old boys teamed with a 14-year-old girl to do battle against an alien invasion and its government cover-up. Those middle schoolers faced their challenges far more sensibly than some of the Enterprise crew members do theirs. Theyre like the kids from Glee charged with saving the universe -- or getting a third season for Smash. (All right some missions are impossible.)  Warning  Spoilers ahead   A few grownups step into this Darkness. Pike is the mutton-chopped father figure who in the 2009 Star Trek saved Kirk from a bar fight with space cadets and recommended him for the academy. Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller more than a quarter-century after he starred in RoboCop) is Pikes superior and Carols dad; his galactic trigger finger proves even itchier than Kirks. But the real adult supervision comes from a fellow named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch). Harrison mounts a one-man 9/11-style terrorist assault on Starfleet Central destroys the archive housing Klingon intel and in the process wipes out so many of the senior officers that Kirk and the gang among the few survivors are assigned to capture him on Kronos the Klingon home planet. (READ Corliss on the first season of the original Star Trek) Good luck with that. ""He is ruthless brilliant and will not hesitate to kill every single one of you"" warns Spock Prime (Nimoy back for another fleeting guest shot). Harrison is also the movies one compelling character and if you want to know his true identity dont read the cast list on the Internet Movie Database. We shall say only that he has his origins in the ""Space Seed"" episode of the TV shows first season; he later graced one of the best of the feature films. (For teasing purposes well add that that pictures title anagrams to What the ho Frank and the actors name to Drat Abnormal Icon) Cumberbatch raises the anxiety level and performance standard whenever hes onscreen. As the latest Sherlock Holmes on BBC he has embodied a supersmart hero of the 1890s. Here he is the supersmart villain of the 1990s teleported to the 23rd century.  All Clear You have left the Spoiler Zone   With high cheekbones and the penetrating stare of a superior automaton -- or maybe just a posh Englishman looking pityingly on the other mostly American actors -- Cumberbatch infuses Into Darkness with a creepy class. Everyone else has to make do by looking fabulous. Chris Pines face has the blurry handsomeness of James Dean painted on velvet. (When he and Greenwood confront each other going eyeball to eyeball the only question is Whose are bluer?) Saldana remembered as the Pandoran princess in Avatar wears eyelashes as long as light-years; and on Kronos when she speaks Klingon it sounds like a Sonnet from the Portuguese. Eve the perfect woman in Shes Out of My League provides light-dark contrast to Saldana and flashes her panties perhaps to establish her availability as a Kirk girlfriend in a later episode. Can a woman ever lasso this wild man? His heroic impulsiveness occasionally translates as the crackpottery of a gung-ho sergeant leading his men into the Big Galactic Muddy. When Pike disciplines Kirk and reminds him that he is meant to be primarily an explorer not a warrior it might be the spirit of Gene Roddenberry speaking. The original series didnt hold to the suspicious maybe paranoid belief that each new planet (read the Soviet Union) harbored a doomsday threat to Starfleet (read America). The show sought accommodation and understanding with distant peoples as much as triumph over alien warlords. Thats why Kirk and Spock had equal dramatic and ethical pull. (READ a 1975 story on the earliest Trekkies by subscribing to TIME) Parables of equanimity suit a TV series more than an action picture; one is essentially liberal the other conservative. And the 60s they were so long ago. Abrams knows that every contemporary sci-fi film is really a war movie and that Star Trek to be modern had to grow a tougher skin. Kirk the rogue warrior may be heading for the borderline of sociopathy but he has to be right in his hunches about the predatory nature of the creatures out there. Yet that makes Spock an irrelevancy -- the professor type from old sci-fi movies who tried reasoning with the evil or barbarous life forms before they swatted him into unconsciousness. A pacifist who hopes to be Magellan Spock must stand aside while the cowboy king does his thing. One aspect of Star Trek at least has to be honored in any prequel. Our planet and the universe can be on the brink of annihilation but most of the Enterprise crew members are immortal; they must survive to populate the 1966 TV show. Into Darkness flirts with the demise of one prominent character but when he revives Bones says ""Oh dont be melodramatic. You were barely dead."" This series will survive as well until 2016 -- when you can bet there will be a third Star Trek to celebrate the TV shows 50th anniversary. Heres hoping that those three years will bestow a measure of maturity on all concerned Kirk and his bright curators too.

(Paramount Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday May 13 2013 1039 PM Title Star Trek Into Darkness Film Info With Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Zoe Saldana Benedict Cumberbatch The crew of the Enterprise faces an interstellar terrorist. Director J.J. Abrams (212). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. In Imax 3D. Opens Thursday. Director J.J. Abrams doesnt believe in the no-win scenario. So for ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" the filmmaker steeps his action-adventure in myth but wires it for power. The result is a stunningly nervy sequel that vaporizes any worries that Abrams terrific 2009 reboot was a fluke. The ""Trek"" world is full of challenges of course including ridge-headed Klingons and rigid Starfleet rules. But second films pose a unique threat. Yet this action-filled sci-fi drama bridges the worlds of sci-fi brains and mainstream muscle much like that other famous second film in its history 1982s great ""Wrath of Khan."" ""Into Darkness"" well-guarded narrative thrills cant be revealed for fear of spoilers. But once its in full gear its steely streamlined story is propulsive in its own right. Zachary Quinto in ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" The actors are well-cast and the action-packed film has one of the best villains in recent memory. (Industrial Light amp; Magic) Picking up shortly after the events of Abrams earlier film this one finds James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and the Enterprise crew -- including Uhura (Zoe Saldana) Sulu (John Cho) Chekhov (Anton Yelchin) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) -- hunting down a terrorist called John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) whos aiming for Starfleet Command. Brilliant ruthless and seemingly indestructible Harrison is captured by Kirk amp; Co. while he hides on the Klingon home planet. Wrong move It turns out Harrisons plans involve getting a starship and wreaking havoc. With a sidelined Scotty (Simon Pegg) his ace in the hole Kirk first allies with then tries to outsmart this foe unafraid of death. Then all hell breaks loose. Zachary Quinto has a slightly more emotional take on Spock that helps his romance with Uhura. (Paramount) If galloping around the cosmos is a game for the young Abrams and his perfect cast have re-energized the franchises new prime directive Make it smart keep it moving and dont sweat the past. That last part may irk Trekkies but the 2009 films setup of messing with established timelines frees Abrams from orthodoxy. The ballsy way this film flip-flops ""Trek"" history is worthy of commendation. Yet that doesnt mean screenwriters Alex Kurtzman Damon Lindelof and Roberto Orci dont set up a chunky first hour. By the time its gripping second half kicks in were treated to several rousing action sequences including a wild space surf and a hand-to-hand battle long overdue. Explosions arent uncommon in outer space for the Star  Trek crew. (Paramount Pictures) The rock-solid cast is up to the challenge performing the tricky balancing act of recalling iconic pop-culture personas while adding their own stamp. Pine makes Kirk driven to succeed a bullish thinker striding through scenes shoulders-first. Quintos (slightly) more emotional take on Spock allows for new shadings of the green-blooded Vulcan -- and a romance with Uhura. Cumberbatch meanwhile makes for one of the best blockbuster villains in recent memory. While baby-faced in profile Harrison is hawkishly fierce when coming at Kirk straight-on. Hes more than a match for the Enterprises tenacious captain an element this brawny movie savors. Trekkies will love the breathtaking CGI and enhanced battle scenes. Even Alice Eve as a scientist whose assignment aboard the ship is crucial feels right and not just because of her 60s throwback hairdo and miniskirt. Accompanied by Michael Giacchinos noble score and cool effects this go-all-out sequel really does try to go where no one has gone before.

Photo Zade Rosenthal Uhura (Zoe Saldana) helps Spock (Zachary Quinto) suit up in a scene from Star Trek Into Darkness. (AP) Why would a Starfleet admiral ask a 300-year-old frozen man for help? asks Captain Kirk in his latest adventure -- and after sitting through two-plus hours of the mind-numbing ""Star Trek Into Darkness damned if I could tell you why. Or explain exactly why that defrosted villain levels San Francisco in what almost amounts to an afterthought. The only darkness here -- besides the dingy-looking images dimmed by 3-D glasses -- is the murky plot which is as silly as it is arbitrary. A more accurate title for J. J. Abrams followup to his vastly more satisfying 2009 reboot would be If you really wanted to leave out the colon ""Star Trek This Time Its Personal. After temporarily being demoted for disobeying directives for the 2947th time Kirk (Chris Pine) is made captain again. All he has to do is promise the aforementioned Starfleet admiral (Peter Weller) to take out the defrosted intergalactic villain (Benedict Cumberbatch) for killing Kirks mentor (Bruce Greenwood) and oh yeah destroying a good portion of 23rd-century London in a terrorist attack. This takes Kirk and company to a Klingon stronghold where the good captain is persuaded by Spock (Zachary Quinto) to give the bad guy who goes by the name John Harrison a chance to surrender. Bad move. Harrison -- whose actual identity will easily be guessed by Trekkers (no one else will really care) -- is a super being impervious to harm who knows everything except how to deliver a decent quip. In short hes lethally boring. RELATED WHY SOME HIGH-PROFILE TREKKIES ARENT HAPPY WITH THE NEW STAR TREK ""Harrison"" gets plenty of help in stunning audiences into submission from Abrams. The director and his writers serve up reams of leaden dialogue (""Cut the 23rd wire down) and utterly generic action sequences. Abrams shoots something like 90 percent of the film in closeups. After watching this in IMAX I felt like I knew every pore on Pines face personally as well as every square inch of the Enterprise. The special effects are surprisingly cheesy for a big-budget event movie and the post-converted 3-D is nothing to write home about. Youll find more impressive 3-D space footage in the trailer for ""Gravity than in all of this movie which plods along from climax to climax without actually building any momentum. This would be more tolerable if any of the regulars had anything more than one-dimensional characters to play or were permitted to relax their strained impressions of actors from a 50-year-old TV series. The budding romance between Spock and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is a nonstarter and the admirals dishy daughter (Alice Eve) doesnt seem interested in Kirk even if she does at one point appear briefly in a bikini. The Kirk-Spock bromance is better fleshed out but in clumsy fashion as each is required to save the others life. ""Star Trek Into Darkness doesnt end so much as pause at the end. Abrams will next direct a ""Star Wars reboot. Fine. Just keep him away from the sequel. Follow LouLumenick on Twitter for the latest movie news and reviews.

(Zade Rosenthal/Paramount Pictures) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 14 2013 at 630 AM updated May 14 2013 at 351 PM comments Live long and prosper. After more than 40 years in the public consciousness its clear that the ""Star Trek"" franchise has accomplished the first part of that blessing. But can it continue the second? ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" almost assures it. It is a long-held belief among Trekkers -- and yes you can call me one as long as you dont call me a Trekkie -- that all even-numbered ""Trek"" movies were great. The odd ones -- er not so much. And although it doesnt have a number after its title this one proves the point. Its not that the initial movie in the reboot was bad. It was bright and fun and -- after a series of increasingly rote ""Next Generation"" entries - full of a fresh energy. But the plot wasnt the best overly tricky and a bit fuzzy in a ""Lost"" kind of way. There are still some convolutions in the script here particularly as applies to time (the filmmakers are once again veterans of ""Lost"" which may help explain it). And diehard fans should be reminded that this is an alternate Trek universe in which characters we think we know -- Christopher Pike or Carol Marcus -- may have different pasts or futures. But yes the true-blue crew -- Kirk and Spock Bones and Scotty Uhura and Chekov and Sulu -- are all here. And as wed remembered them and grown to love them. There are some refinements. Spock and Uhura have a slightly bumpy relationship and Uhura gets quite a bit more to do. (Which is as it should be; groundbreaking as her character was on the TV show Nichelle Nichols was basically an intergalactic telephone operator.) There are also some false notes. While hes a bit more active too Simon Pegg still plays Scott too broadly for my taste and Im afraid nathink vill ever make me like Anton Yelchins curly-haired Chekov. And yes some of the rewriting of the ""Star Trek"" canon is a little jarring. But much of it is wonderful. The film draws on a number of plot elements from old TV episodes and earlier movies -- occasionally recasting and repurposing entire scenes -- in a way that shows both knowledge of and respect for the originals. Its done with a nod not a sneer. As to what those elements are -- well I wont tell you. (And honestly no real fan -- of the show or moviegoing in general - would.) But do know that a lot of favorite concepts and catchphrases -- including the Prime Directive tribbles and ""the needs of the many"" -- play a part. The basic story has young Captain Kirk getting busted -- again -- for disobeying orders. But then theres a traitorous attack on Earth by some home-grown terrorist. And Kirk and his crew are dispatched to find the villain and assassinate him by remote control. (Another thing this movie has kept the TV shows topical plotlines.) But death-by-drone is well not exactly a very Kirk thing to do. Disobeying orders however is. Except this time its going to have far more consequences than even dour Dr. McCoy can predict. Pine is very good here as the young Kirk who is even randier than we knew (a three-way with pussycat-tailed aliens is not beyond him). Karl Urban and Zachary Quinto create plausible alternate versions of Bones and Spock Zoe Saldana takes Uhura to a new level and Benedict Cumberbatch is a sort of Klaatu-gone-bad as Harrison the films icy villain. Add to that director J.J. Abrams good use of 3D several well-staged fight sequences and some excellent special effects -- and well you could spend the rest of the summer waiting for a better popcorn movie. But that would be highly illogical. Beam yourself down to a multiplex now Theres intelligent life there. Ratings note The film contains violence and some suggestive material. Star Trek Into Darkness (PG-13) Paramount (132 min.) Directed by J. J. Abrams. With Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Zoe Saldana Karl Urban Benedict Cumberbatch.

J.J. Abramss second Star Trek picture Star Trek Into Darkness is so mystically in tune with both the dictates of its studio and the yearnings of its audience that he ought to be anointed Most Reverend Guardian of the Holy Franchises. Even more than its predecessor the movie is a combination reboot and religious revival the Grail and Da Bomb. It symbolically resurrects the dead and sets a course for the starsa five-year mission that will introduce fantastical alien races and generate fantastical amounts of money. With a Star Wars picture looming Abrams is ready for his own Vatican-like countrywith a cathedral for Comic-Con conventions. Is the movie good? Its hard to be objective. The plotting is clunky and nonsensical but Abrams and crew bombarded me into happiness. More than that they made me feel so special for getting the in-jokes. Star Trek Into Darkness is a feature-length dialogue with Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan Abrams and screenwriters Alex Kurtzman Robert Orci and Damon Lindelhof set the 1982 films best-known lines (and best-known scream) in peculiar new contexts. Alliances are muddledfascinatingly. The narrative never stops twisting. A word about Wrath of Khan. Apart from reviving the series after the barbiturate that was Star Trek The Motion Picture director Nicholas Meyer found the perfect balance between wonky sci-fi and nautical sweep. (Its amazing how similar the Star Trek template is to Master and Commander.) The film is hard to replicate though. A sequel to the TV episode Space Seed that introduced the genetically enhanced psychopath Khan (Ricardo Montalban) it derives its power from Kirks inability to handle late middle ageand from pitting two over-the-hill titans against each other in a starship duel to the death. How can Abrams rekindle that rivalry with younger actors? Not easily. But in some ways he doesnt have to. He has a cleanish slate. In Abramss first Star Trek a nobody called Nero (Eric Bana) exploded out of the future to take revenge for the death of his wife and changed history. Kirk (Chris Pine) would now grow up fatherless wild instead of disciplined. Spock would lose his home planet and be Kirks sexual rival busy making the beast with two backs with Uhura (Zoe Saldana). The old crew would end up together anyway Kirk winning command of the Enterprise with almost no time served under anyone else. (Poor Riker from The Next Generation got paunchy waiting for his own ship.) In this time line the discovery of Khanfloating in space cryogenically preserved with his familyhas been moved way up. Hes played by Benedict Cumberbatch who made Sherlock Holmes his own and now takes on the legacy of a Latin lover with the greatest pecs ever seen on a 62-year-old. Cumberbatch has his own physiological objects of wonder though a pair of eyes so wide apart that he looks to have twice the peripheral vision of a normal human. As Khan he is ravenlike in repose with a preternatural stillness. He doesnt worry about the blows that rain down on him. Hes beyond pain. Beyond good and evil too. Hes not Montalbans declamatory Ahab. Hes a Nietzschean superman. What he sets in motion is the most brutal Trek ever with a mammoth body count and wince-inducing pummelings. The characters keep insisting that the Enterprise is a ship of exploration not warwhile its being torpedoed to pieces. I dont envision calm currents for this crew. And Abrams must have been limbering up for Star Wars Like George Lucas he sprinkles every frame with cyber-MSG for the wow factor. A scene in which characters in space suits zoom through a 3-D debris field had me wishing for an airsickness bag. But does the central trinity still play? Whereas the old Kirk had to navigate between cold logic (Spock) and humanist emotion (Dr. McCoy) the new one is too much of a hothead to listenmaking the doctor superfluous and Karl Urban little more than a one-liner machine. But then this whole Enterprise is staffed with quipsters and exhibitionists. Not for Zachary Quinto the still ever-so-slightly querulous demeanor of Leonard Nimoy. His half-humanity is more like three-quarters his feelings on the surface. Hes a good actor but his Spock has no secrets. The new-model characters are slim and alarmingly smooth-skinned. Anton Yelchins Chekhov still doesnt look old enough to shave. And whats the deal with his terrible accent? He was born in Russia but makes Walter Koenig look like a veteran of the Moscow Art Theatre. Simon Peggs Scotty is not a reassuring presence but an out-and-out hysteric. John Cho blessedly underplays Suluand as a result is always upstaged. The pleasure of an Uhura who takes part in the action is dampened by the rest of the role which requires her either to entreat Spock to be careful or exhort him to get the bad guy. Presumably to offset Saldanas Navi-ish exoticism theres a fresh-faced little blonde (Alice Eve) whos supposedly the young Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch in Wrath). Looks like the next one could channel that old porn standby Star Trek III The Search for Cock. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Abrams sets his filmmaking to stun with a sequel in every respect equal or even superior to its splendid 2009 predecessor J.J. Abrams sets his filmmaking to ""stun"" for ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" a sequel in every respect equal or even superior to its splendid 2009 predecessor which lovingly and cleverly rebooted Gene Roddenberrys long-running space opera following the black hole of 2002s ""Star Trek Nemesis."" Markedly grander in scale although never at the expense of its richly human (and half-human) characters ""Into Darkness"" may not boldly go where no ""Trek"" adventure has gone before but getting there is such a well-crafted immensely pleasurable ride that it would be positively Vulcan to nitpick. Global box office cume should easily warp past the prior pics 385 million for this sturdy Paramount tentpole which opens overseas May 9 before beaming down Stateside one week later. Abrams whose last pic was the lyrical ""E.T.""/""Close Encounters"" homage ""Super 8"" here tips his hat to the ""Indiana Jones"" series opening with a thrilling setpiece that finds Kirk (Chris Pine) and Bones (the sly loose-limbed Karl Urban) on the run from a tribe of very angry natives on the planet Nibiru. The natives decked out in head-to-toe clay body paint shimmer like human ceramics as they chase the Starfleet officers through a crimson forest the lush colors of returning d.p. Dan Mindel all but searing the screen. Meanwhile Spock (Zachary Quinto) toils away nearby attempting to insert a high-tech ice cube into the raging volcano that threatens to destroy Nibiru and its inhabitants -- a dangerous mission that quickly goes awry building to a classic ""Trek"" standoff between stubborn Vulcan logic and impulsive human emotion. <a href=""http//polldaddy.com/poll/7078636"">Take Our Poll</a> The Enterprise crew has scarcely recovered from that one when back on Earth a terror bombing lays waste to a top-secret Starfleet intelligence facility and brings to the fore a new galactic baddie a rogue Starfleet officer named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who claims credit for the attack and after an equally brazen follow-up hightails it deep into Klingon-controlled space. The hawkish Adm. Marcus (Peter Weller) dispatches the Enterprise in hot pursuit with this familiar-sounding objective Shoot first ask questions later and avoid starting a war with the locals. Welcome to ""Star Trek Into Zero Dark Thirty."" Only this John Harrison is a slippery sort who when given the chance claims not to be the villain at all but rather a pawn in someone elses deadlier scheme. And for much of its running time ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" makes a good guessing game out of whether this mysterious stranger with the glacial glare and bones seemingly made of steel is friend foe or -- like the ""old Spock"" of Abrams first ""Trek"" -- a little bit of history repeating. It hardly matters because whatever Cumberbatch is playing hes wonderful to watch infusing the movie with the kind of exotic grandeur Eric Banas wan Romulan henchman (arguably the weakest link in the 2009 film) largely lacked. Also making her maiden ""Trek"" voyage is the lovely Alice Eve as an ambitious science officer who lies her way on to the Enterprise deck and makes goo-goo eyes with the good Captain. She is not it turns out the ships only stowaway. Having previously established an alternate ""Trek"" timeline in which all the events of prior series and movies still happened but arent necessarily doomed to recur Abrams and returning writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (now joined by ""Lost"" co-creator Damon Lindelof) here take that idea and run with it invoking prior ""Trek"" lore when it suits them freely branching off into new directions when it doesnt. (Hell theres even some trouble with a tribble.) Its a tricky business balancing reverence with reinvention but like the young Kirk Abrams seems altogether more comfortable in the captains chair this time -- not just in the large-scale action scenes but particularly in the quieter ones where you can sense his real investment in these characters and his confident touch with actors. SEE ALSO Star Trek Premieres in London (Photos) The film builds particularly well on the burgeoning Kirk-Spock friendship with Pine showing reserves of vulnerability and doubt beneath his cocksure exterior while Quinto adds gravitas to Spocks eternal inner conflict -- and his deepening romance with Lt. Uhura (Zoe Saldana). But make no mistake The action when it comes is superbly executed whether its giant vessels making mincemeat of one another or the simpler excitements of old-fashioned hand-to-hand combat and foot chases through crowded promenades. The best even-numbered films in the original ""Trek"" film franchise were shaped by the guiding intelligence of writer-director Nicholas Meyer who laced the Starfleet jargon with high-toned literary references and a gently self-mocking sense of humor. Abrams too manages to keep the mood buoyant even when the fate of the universe is hanging in the balance more than earning his tears when he finally decides to milk them. But if Meyers primary references were Shakespeare Dickens and Conan Doyle Abrams are Spielberg John Hughes and Cameron Crowe. In defiance of the self-congratulatory snark that has become de rigueur in Hollywood franchise fare he brings a shimmering pop romanticism to ""Treks"" stalwart ideals of friendship heroism and self-sacrifice. Theres something bold about that indeed. ""Into Darkness"" is a beautifully modulated and sustained piece of work across the board with visual effects that seamlessly meld live-action and computer-animated elements given further texture by old-fashioned celluloid lensing (with 65mm Imax used for key action scenes). Post-production 3D conversion by Stereo D ranks among the best of its kind. The Enterprise has rarely looked sleeker than it does on production designer Scott Chambliss sets. Adding the cherry to the top of this cinematic sundae composer Michael Giacchinos soaring score once again revives Alexander Courages immortal Trek theme for the closing credits.

Susu says January 4 2015 at 656 am I know Ill sound like an old guy but J.J. Abrams just doesnt get Star Trek. Maybe thats just fine because he is searching for a new and younger audience that probably doesnt get Star Trek either. Star Trek was never about the special effects or action. Most of the best Trek stories from all of the television shows (TOS through Enterprise) didnt rely on either. Action and special effects were always there but they were used to tell a story instead of becoming the story. To be fair there is one thing to like about the new Star Trek reboot. The cast is great and it is easy to see the original actors through them. After that Im over this thing. It is just an action movie series using Star Treks name to sell tickets. If you think this is great science fiction in the Star Trek universe then enjoy it. If you are looking for something more and want to really understand what Star Trek is about then queue up ""Measure of a Man"" from TNG just one of many classic Star Trek episodes that expose this new ""reboot"" for the sham that it is. Gene Roddenberry would be ashamed. Reply RobB says May 18 2013 at 1224 pm Just saw this awesome movie in 3D IMAX and that is the way to see a movie like this This is the franchise for 3D IMAX and you will be amazed. The cast is great the visuals are spectacular and set a new standard. The story plot lines etc like all incarnations of Star Trek will remain debatable because that is also what fans enjoy about Star Trek. Reply jabtakhaijaandownload says May 4 2013 at 1151 pm Star Trek Into Darkness Full Movie Download http//startrekintodarknessmoviedownload.webs.com/ Reply John Freimann says May 3 2013 at 931 pm I dont care for Science Fiction which keeps me out of the theater a lot these days; however with that cast I might have to change my mind and get a ticket. Reply Thomas Bray says May 5 2013 at 1052 pm Im not trying to convince you but if you like a smartphone using your computer and flying on an airplane it all was once science-fiction. Thats what makes a well-made science-fiction movie exciting Everyone in the modern world reaps the enjoyment and pleasure of a small number of people who pushed ahead with ideas that were once thought of as ludicrous Science is a very beautiful thing because its all around us Reply Conspiracy says May 3 2013 at 813 pm SPOILERS........ I just want to know why they called this Villain ""Khan"". Why not just make him John Harrison...yet another Genetic Manipulation along the same lines. It just makes no logical sense that a white Englishman is named Khan Noonien Singh...perhaps the most Ethnic name in all of Sci-Fi....in fact it defined who Khan was...an Indian/Punjabi Prince who rose up out of India and ruled 1/3 of the world. And dont talk about timelines...the rift only occurred from the point Nero went back...everything that came before was the same. This smacks of Studio Whitewashing the character without changing the name just so they could hire Cumberbatch. Reply Jonah Krautter (kraut1701) says May 7 2013 at 154 pm Oh yes because a white Mexican named Ricardo Montalban was entirely believable as an Indian Sikh? Reply RobB says May 18 2013 at 1158 am I tend to agree with ""Conspiracy says"". The big reveal felt more like a big let down to me. If he were anyone one else I would have been happier at that moment in an otherwise fantastic movie. If I recall correctly in the TOS version Khan mentions there were others like him but he believed he was the last leader of his kind so there was room for another Khan like character and plot in ST cannon prior to the JJ alternate universe. John Freimann says May 8 2013 at 842 pm Im not really sure as to what you are referring however if one is a good actor why shouldnt he be believable? Acting is about being able to create a character outside of yourself. Whether an actor can do that or not tells us a lot about the extent of their talent. Tonka says May 8 2013 at 729 pm Love that comment ) TechFan says May 4 2013 at 232 pm I heard about this spoiler while the movie was being made. I dont know if Im in the ballpark since I havent seen the film yet but heres my thinking. Khan was overthrown on Earth in the late 1990s according to the episode ""Space Seed"" and his sleeper ship Botany Bay was discovered by the Enterprise over 200 years later. But ya gotta remember thanks to Nero the timeline has changed between these two events and Starfleet Command has sent the Enterprise to a different part of the galaxy when Khans ship is found this time by a Klingon vessel. A fierce battle for control of both ships kills everyone but Khan. Now worried hell be hunted down on a rescue freighter he sees an old episode of ""Undercover Boss"" and goes through the same process Colonel Moon in ""Die Another Day"" used to transform himself into James Bond nemesis Gustav Graves. Except this time Ricardo Montalban becomes Benedict Cumberbatch. So there you go. See how this timeline change thing can work out? Reply Brian Davison says May 3 2013 at 1158 am Geezer Trekkies clinging so desperately to the past crack me up. After the disasters of Voyager Enterprise Insurrection and Nemesis Star Trek had two choices -- evolve or die. No this isnt your Star Trek anymore and thats a good thing. People actually want to watch this version of Star Trek so you can either embrace a different take with a younger cast or you can sit in your basement watching the same DVDs over and over. Your call. Reply James A says May 8 2013 at 619 pm The real fans didnt like those things either. Into darkness is what nemesis tried to be but wasnt and the first movie only an answer to the better work Babylon 5 battlestar and mass effect did and which Ds9 and enterprise was only allowed to hint at. Reply RobB says May 18 2013 at 1210 pm Brian its not fair to compare weekly TV shows to mega budgeted theater movies. Fans of Voyager and Enterprise would disagree they were ""disasters"". JJ has made only two episodes by comparison. Over the decades fans have always found something they would have liked to see or not in all these Star Treks. We love the general concept so almost any Star Trek is better than no Star Trek. True fans love to nitpick. TechFan says May 3 2013 at 1111 am Abrams has been hit or miss with me. His TV shows ""Lost"" and ""Revolution"" left me wondering why I bothered. But his reboot of ""Star Trek"" four years ago was as Spock would say fascinating. Not fixing the timeline at the end of the film was an inspiration-a neat trick so theres no locked-in problem with the events of the original TV series and movies. The new Enterprise crew members were brilliantly chosen especially Simon Pegg as Scotty and Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy. All that helped make a movie that for me was fun surprising and exciting. And from what Ive seen and read ""In Darkness"" should continue to keep ""Star Trek"" boldly going in the entertaining direction it has gone before. Reply spokeat says May 8 2013 at 830 pm I quite agree - the cast are brilliant especially Zachary Quinto Karl Urban. Zoe Saldana and Simon Pegg. Chris Pine John Cho and Anton Yelchin are outstanding as well. In any Star Trek episode or movie there are usually plot holes large enough to warp a starship through but the ethics and morals and camaraderie on display more than make up for those. The team will be pulling more tightly together in this movie. What I like particularly are the ""familial"" and relational moments the moments of true emotion that come through in Orci and Kurtzmans writing. Reply Jeda says May 6 2013 at 356 pm Enterprise was on par with TNG as a series. Its such a shame that show wasnt given more time. Season 3 and 4 were fantastic. Reply Dr Spock says May 3 2013 at 710 am I LOVE this new reboot of the franchise. Star Trek Troopers; running and jumping off of things and dangling from things and falling off of things. What more could a Trekkie ask for? Non-stop running and jumping and falling and dangling. Star Trek Troopers is awesome Reply Zach Johns says May 3 2013 at 129 am I can hardly wait for May 15th - they took way too long to get this movie on-screen but I look forward to sterling performances a typically hokey Star Trek plot and great character development. I have always watched Star Trek for the characters interaction as a ""family"" and this film looks to draw the ""family"" closer together. Kewl splosions and plenty of action are hallmarks of Summer releases; I wish people would quit downing Abrams for making a movie that will draw new people into the world of Star Trek. Then there may be an audience for a television show which would be a great venue for science- and exploration-centered stories. Abrams and his writers have BROUGHT PEOPLE IN to see Star Trek and that is more important than how Engineering looks or the specifications of the Enterprise. Reply Stephanie Smith says May 2 2013 at 1149 pm As an old-school Trekkie I have to say that I am not at all pleased with this review. I saw the last Trek film that JJ Abrams did and while I like the fact that we got the actor who played Thor out of it to borrow a few words from the late Roger Ebert this version of Star Trek is ""an insult to science to fiction and to the hyphen in between"". Not to disrespect JJ but this version seems to be less about the story and more about ""kewl splosions"" and fights with bad guys who are bad solely for the purpose of being bad. Gene Roddenberry created the original Star Trek to be thought-provoking and this appears to be anything but. If I do see the new film at all it will be through a DVD rental. Reply Dan says May 3 2013 at 424 pm As a self-described ""old school trekkie"" you no doubt read Star Trek II and VI director Nicholas Meyers bio in which he basically described Gene Roddenberry as a crotchety old guy that didnt like Wrath of Khan and clung to a boring clunky Trek. Meyer took that and made it good. And now Meyer has taken that and made it exciting. People that worship at the altar of Roddenberry are elevating a false god. Reply RobB says May 18 2013 at 107 pm Not to take anything away form the ""Great Bird of The Galaxy"" but G.R. demanded the ""creator"" title and emphasized that over the reality of the team of creative people who made Star Trek more entertaining than his rather bland ambiguous and sometimes ridiculous ideas. An example being Spock who was originally conceived by G.R. to be red with a tail. When Paramount asked him for a movie idea his was a God plot where God was the bad guy. One of his best writers from TOS D.C. Fontana left the NextGen show in disgust. I am thankful for his ""wagon-train to the stars"" and his use of Horatio Hornblower as Capt. Kirk but many people contributed to both the success and failures over the past 47 years and I for one am looking forward to the future because of all of them. Scott Foundas says May 3 2013 at 620 am Dear Stephanie Ebert also wrote of the 2009 ""Trek"" ""The movie deals with narrative housekeeping. Perhaps the next one will engage these characters in a more challenging and devious story one more about testing their personalities than re-establishing them."" And so it is. Reply Cumbertrekky (cumbertrekky) says May 2 2013 at 1117 pm Really pleased by this review. I hope Cumberbatch will continue his relationship with JJ Abrams in Star Wars VII Reply sam says May 2 2013 at 919 pm benedict cumberbatch for the win i love love the 2009 film love the crew and jj- and having Benedict on board was like cherries upon cherries on top. Whats not to like??? Reply Al Milson says May 6 2013 at 312 pm Benedict Cumberbatch looks like the only reason to go see this confused mess. I think I will pass. Reply Gayle Falkenthal APR (PRProSanDiego) says May 2 2013 at 750 pm This is the one film Im eager to see this summer in an actual honest to God theater. im thrilled to read such a good review right out of the gate.

TWITTER J.J. Abrams returns to direct the crew of the Enterprise as Chris Pine Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana face off against Benedict Cumberbatch. Star Trek Into Darkness J.J. Abramss second entry in his reboot of the eternal franchise has been engineered rather than directed calibrated to deliver sensation on cue and stocked with just enough new character twists to keep fans rapt. At its core an intergalactic manhunt tale about a traitor to the cause the production gives the impression of a massive machine cranked up for two hours of full output; it efficiently delivers what its built to do but without style or personality. The widely admired 2009 series relaunch pulled in 385 million in worldwide box office (an unusual two-thirds of that in the American market) and this one should follow very closely in that trajectory. Continuity is assured by the full team reboarding the U.S.S. Enterprise for this flight from the attractive and capable cast headed by Chris Pine Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana to writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (now joined by producer Damon Lindelof) and other key behind-the-scenes hands. As seen in normally dynamic 3D Imax however the film looks surprisingly flat bordering on cheesy; the images are pale thin and bleached out makeup and facial blemishes are magnified and the very shallow depth-of-field in many shots (not the CGI but real photography) works against the point of the format. After a steady progression in the brilliant visual quality of big-budget effects-heavy major releases during the past couple of years this one takes a few steps backward. PHOTOS Star Trek Into Darkness Cast Beams Up to London for World Premiere Not that this incident-jammed yarn is dull or uneventful far from it. For a genre film of this sort extra attention has been paid to provide the leads with morsels of human dimensions including crises of conscience uncertainty fallibility hidden motives and character traits that determine that they sometimes just cant help themselves; these are details that are not essential but nonetheless prove welcome as they create undercurrents that werent always there in Star Trek TV episodes or in the previous 11 feature films. Right off the bat feelings that surface between the adamantly unemotional Spock (Quinto) and the overtly admiring Uhura (Saldana) add something to an otherwise rampantly hectic opening action sequence set on a volcanic planet. For his part Kirk (Pine) contents himself upon his return to Earth with a briefly shown three-way with two babes. But the good times end there as Kirk is upbraided by his superior (Bruce Greenwood) for insubordination and lying about his last mission his captaincy revoked while Spock is reassigned. The fundamental difference between the two is nicely played up all the way through Kirk will cover for his colleague and do whats expedient at the moment while a Vulcan as Spock reminds cannot lie. Both attitudes can cause trouble. But nothing like the trauma provoked by out-and-out bad guy John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) an insider who is immediately identified as the terrorist behind a huge explosion within a Starfleet archive causing enormous damage to a very vertical 23rd century London. With Harrison quickly fleeing to the planet Kronos to hide Kirk regains his stripes and the Enterprise sets out to capture the criminal without setting off a full-scale war with the local Klingons. PHOTOS 30 Groundbreaking Sci-Fi Films Even here moral issues between Kirk and Spock come into play that are marginally more engaging than the cranked-up action sequences that are manufactured every 10 or 15 minutes too often with a rote push-button feeling to them. Spock objects to the entire nature of the mission declaring it illegal and ""morally wrong"" to assassinate a suspect rather than returning him for trial. The flight seems further compromised by the presence of a stranger Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) a blonde hottie whos the daughter of a Starfleet admiral (Peter Weller) whose own motives seem more than a bit suspicious given his insistence upon transforming the Enterprise into a warship by the installation of special rocket torpedoes. The crew manages to take Harrison but under rather different circumstances than anticipated and the revelation of his true identity will come as no surprise to fanboys who live to unearth this sort of information. There are deceptions and numerous chess moves made purely on hunches or in Spocks case by his exceptional ability to determine the precise odds on any eventuality. Desperate suspense scenes chime in like clockwork sometimes dully spurred by technical malfunctions and one has Kirk and Harrison zooming through space in outfits that recall the two decades-old The Rocketeer. In the end justice is served and the day is won but not without another major city San Francisco taking it severely on the chin. PHOTOS Star Trek Into Darkness 13 Photos to Get You in the Mood The returning actors all fit their roles with absolute comfort while the deep-voiced Cumberbatch asserts fully self-justified treachery and Weller and Eve nicely essay equivocal characters. But after impressing well enough in his previous big-screen directorial outings Abrams works in a narrower less imaginative mode here; theres little sense of style no grace notes or flights of imagination. One feels the dedication of a young musician at a recital determined not to make any mistakes but theres no hint of creative interpretation personal feelings or the spreading of artistic wings. Those anticipating Abrams take on Star Wars as he embarks upon that franchise will no doubt have plenty of opinions about its future based on this professionally capable but creatively humdrum outing.

Director JJ Abrams - recently anointed the new keeper of the Star Wars flame - revived the Star Trek franchise back in 2009 by taking it back in time (in Trekkie terms that is; its still the future for us) pumping it with wit and style and giving life to younger versions of Captain Kirk Spock Scotty and the rest of that space geeks dream team. Here the main focus is internal strife rather than structural revolution as Kirk and Spock get catty with each other and Harrison emerges as a disgruntled insider bent on initiating spectacles of domestic terrorism. The result is a stop-gap tale thats modest fun and briefly amusing rather than one that breaks new ground or offers hugely memorable set pieces. The most striking scenes come without doubt at the start as Kirk (Chris Pine) struggles to rescue Spock (Zachary Quinto) from a volcano on a distant planet. We witness a primitive race - carefully colour-coded all white yellow and red - as they first lay eyes on a spaceship. Its a powerful moment and nothing later matches up to it even if two episodes of city-bashing (first London then San Francisco) offer their fair share of wide-eyed 3D viewing. The revived Star Trek films are shaping up to be the opposite of Christopher Nolans Batman tales in that theyre light on bleakness and attitude. There are enough gags (Simon Pegg is fun again as Scotty) and wit (the tension between Kirk and Spock is winning) between darker bouts of space fighting and ship-saving to keep the mood airy and unpretentious. Only when were treated to a gratuitous over-the-shoulder underwear shot of Alice Eve as the Enterprises new recruit does this breeziness tip into recklessness. Its here that we sense the filmmakers worry that the whole thing might be a bit too boyish and sexless. That said the script manages to introduce some thoughtfulness into proceedings via Spocks morose musings on death and feelings (or lack of them). Its compulsory for blockbuster villains to be British of course and Cumberbatch runs with an imperial theatrical haughtiness rather than trying to bury it. His bad guy is distinctly human if a little two-dimensional and he succeeds in showing real ice running through his veins and bringing some weight to a cast that generally offers more geniality than gravitas.

Theres plenty of action and som fantastic battle sequences. However it doesnt live up to re-watching with an overlong plot its main offender but its still fun. Chris Pine is pretty loveable as Kirk and Zachary Pinto excellent as Spock. Its a shame that Zoe Saldana has to have a scowl plastered on her face throughout but her standoff with the Clingon is one of the best scenes throughout. Benedict is eerily cool as the psychopathic villain somehow managing to be even more intimidating when locked in a prison. Its just a shame that the middle of the film carries too much extra weight - with a tedious stand off between two space ships that although it has some excellent moments should really have been cut by fifteen minutes or so.

Thoroughly enjoyed it...thought naffness was the blue contacts worn by the Captain..and lip jobs a bit sad on the guys. The underwear woman an unneeded extra she did not quite fit in the film bar modelling some new kind of moulded safe bra and pants. but came into her own a bit at the end. The real star was the other actress that talked to the clingons..far the better actress... in my opinion. Cried my heart out in the death scene. Would have liked more of spock talking to daddy spock..Villian was perfect we all hated him. Spock was probably what held it all together. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 11 2013IanFeaturedIts difficult not to like what is generally a pretty good film and I think the Time Out review pretty much has the film nailed. Cumberbatch is excellent and Pegg is making the role of Scotty his own. However from there things start to unravel a bit. The film looks stunning but it is all a bit too clinical all a bit too shiny. The plot is ok but only ok yes the discovery of Khan was a bit obvious as was the ending with its obvious lead into yet more films. My biggest concerns though remain about the leads. Saldhana looks disinterested and Quinto seems to be going through the motions. Only Pine seems to be developing into the role. Dont get me wrong I enjoyed it and yes it is a good film. Thats the problem it is only good and not really great. A solid 3 star film but could and should have been more.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 11 2013scrumpyjackFeaturedFlabby?
