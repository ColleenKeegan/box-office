Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Katie Kilkenny Oct 24 2014 Culture Say what you want about Hollywoods baffling enthusiasm for the board-game movie but the Ouija board was destined to inspire a horror film.Ouija has attracted an eager audience of players and wannabe mediums ever since Charles Kennard and a band of Victorian entrepreneurs filed a patent rebranding the popular spiritualist toy the ""talking board"" in 1891. They bought into a game with suspense in its very infrastructure A player (or multiple) lays his or her hands on a planchette and waits for the moment when it moves across letters and numbers to spell cryptic messages from spirits beyond--or plain gobbledygook depending on your perspective. In the eras since this eerie gameplay has had a way of inspiring great works--in the early 1900s author Emily Grant Hutchings claimed it allowed her to give voice to Mark Twain; the game would later inspire Norman Rockwell and James Merrill would write several epic poems from conversations he conducted via Ouija including a National Book Award winner.Ouija has all the elements of a great experimental film that could practically write itself--recruit a few actors to play introduce a board record the messages conveyed and fill out the backstory with fiction or nonfiction. The problem with the actual film version Ouija is that its pure Hollywood. A product of a corporate alliance between Universal Pictures and Hasbro the joint forces have presumably given the filmmakers no room to experiment. Or at least thats the way it looks in this film where the game of Ouija becomes just another possessed item an omen in the style of The Rings video tape or Annabelles Annabelle. While the rote screenwriting doesnt kill the dark spirit of the worlds creepiest board game it doesnt channel it either.Related Story Horror-Movie Marathon The Brilliant Not-So-Scary Classics The cardboard-and-plastic Hasbro version of the board game famously doesnt provide much instruction. As a result the writers had to improvise some arbitrary rules to fuel the ensuing hackneyed horror plotline. The film opens with two best friends--children who grow up to be Pretty Little Liars-lookalikes Laine (Olivia Cooke) and Debbie (Shelley Hennig)--preparing to play the game. Debbie sets down the law for Laine Never play in a graveyard never play alone and always say goodbye.Flash forward to senior year of high school and grown-up Debbies blowing off Laine to play Ouija alone front of her roaring Victorian-revival fireplace. The board tells her goodbye screen doors open the gas stove lights up on their own and soon Debbies strung up from the foyer chandelier by the very Christmas lights that once brightened up her hearth. Cue her close group of attractive formulaic friends--the Perfect Couple the Boyfriend the Hot One--sniffing around and splitting up to determine what happened. The film goes very quickly from amateur homicide investigation to the gang playing Ouija at night by candlelight.And as the movie progresses it takes a side on the age-old debate Why does Ouija seem to work? There are two modes of thought when it comes to why the planchette moves with apparent intent--either its a spiritualistic medium that channels dead people or its an exercise in the ideomotor phenomenon a scientifically explainable effect in which an individual moves unconsciously as a reflexive response. To keep the horror predictable (as well as to drum up the Ouija myth apologies to all spiritualists) Ouija favors the former. Since Laine regrets that she wasnt a better friend to Debbie she decides Ouija will be her conduit for her feelings and forces her friends to join her at the house where Debbie died and ghost-reception is apparently greater. They establish contact with a presence that calls them ""friend."" Suffice to say its not actually friendly. Before long each player keeps telling the others the mantra ""Its just a game"" with increasingly less conviction.They establish contact with a presence that calls them ""friend."" Suffice to say its not actually friendly. Of course its not just a game a point that Ouija takes to an absurd level of literalness. Absent a lurking killer with a chainsaw the wooden game pieces provide the popup scares. With increasing ridiculousness Ouija appears in strange places--on the bed in the closet in a cardboard box of Debbies things that Laine takes home (conveniently for the story but stupidly for her chances of survival). Is this trope supposed to be ominous or funny? Like the experience of playing Ouija itself it depends on the suspicions of the viewer You can either believe the conceit up front--in which case the exercise in communal spelling makes total sense as a conduit for the dead--or dont at which point everything is hilarious. At least the humor isnt unconsciously evoked--there are a few moments in which sudden ghost appearances yield a benign teen instead of the expected malevolent spirit providing a welcome break from the self-seriousness.The allure of the games spiritual lore proves too great to keep up the exploration of Ouijas true ambiguous player experience. Ouija falls back on the spooky ghost explanation even if there are early nods to the automatists. At a moment in the first act one of Laines friends perspicuously muses that the game might be communicating just because Laines subconscious craves closure. What might have happened if the movie had seen this idea through? Ouija after all remains a pretty compelling mystery for science which sees it as an expression of the fringes of the unconscious--a 2012 study by researchers at the University of British Columbia found that Ouija responses to fact-based questions are about 15% more accurate than normal vocal responses suggesting one were smarter than we (consciously) think we are and two that the game can unleash this hidden intelligence.What if the screenplay have been the result of a candlelit screenwriter seance?Unfortunately there is no hidden intelligence to be summoned from Ouija. While the spiritualist take on the game is only to be expected from a horror movie it doesnt even make the attempt to convert the automatists. Had screenwriting duo Juliet Snowden and Stiles White invested more time in writing authentic characters or spared a beat to mourn the board games victims (as friends fall away their supposed besties return to their detective work a bit too hastily) it might have converted or even intrigued the nonbelievers. If only the film had taken the time to plan shots that conjure scares from a cinematic standpoint rather than showing the Ouija board as a matter-of-fact horror fetish object--behold the chill-inducing sight of a beautiful teenage girl playing Ouija on her own Alas there is not even a ghost of original scares in the treatment which leaves behind the overwhelming impression of resting on its logoed laurels.Regardless the brand remains intact the powerful allure of Ouija and its planchette untarnished. Its mythical qualities have survived many low-budget horror films before (see all the titular versions here) and the games mystique has never waned though it has become something of a joke subject to parodies on I Love Lucy and Friends. But one cant help but wish the creators had tried letting Ouija write itself. What might the screenplay have looked like had it been the result of a candlelit screenwriter seance created at the whims of a planchette instead of Box Office Mojo? Rather less like an obvious money magnet but more befitting of the games timeless ambiguous mystery.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan October 23 2014 I cant help wondering what Hasbro executives were thinking in licensing the companys Ouija board property to Universal Pictures. Just how many copies of this seance-themed novelty item -- suitable for players age 8 and older who might be seeking to commune with the dead on family game night -- were they hoping to sell? A horror movie that practically opens with a shot of someone throwing the infernal thing into a fireplace is not exactly the best commercial. A better question might be Will this gambit sell movie tickets? ""Ouija"" the film is in a difficult position vis-a-vis Ouija the board game. Unlike other beloved Hasbro properties that have been turned into films (e.g. Battleship G.I. Joe action figures and Transformer robot toys) the object at the center of this story -- a device that has been said to facilitate communication with ghosts -- still creeps out a lot of people. That of course is an excellent reason to make a scary movie. The thing is if youre going to do it the movie better actually be scary. Though ""Ouija"" starts off evoking a nicely eerie atmosphere of dread it ultimately goes too far making the liminal space between the spirit world and this one all too eye-rollingly literal. Theres some good news here. ""Ouija"" features a strong believable cast. The young actors playing a group of teens who get sucked into an obsession with an antique Ouija board after the suspicious death of a friend (Shelley Hennig) are quite good at conveying the mix of healthy skepticism and morbid fascination that is necessary to pull an audience into the tale. Anything that presupposes the existence of a form of supernatural texting -- via a movable planchette sliding over a board that has been printed with the letters of the alphabet -- is going to be a tough sell in this modern age of reason and instant messaging. There are no credulous idiots among this crew. And the powers of persuasion of the films heroine Lane (Olivia Cooke) a reluctant Ouija board player who at first simply wants to say ""TTFN"" to her dead BFF are formidable. Its also nice to see actress Lin Shaye of the ""Insidious"" films and other horror titles crop up late in the film in a small but pivotal role. Like Lane the film is seductive. At one point our heroine is shown looking up an online video in which the Ouija boards allegedly supernatural powers are attributed to the ""ideomotor phenomenon"" (i.e. wishful thinking). This bit of preemptory debunking by director Stiles White who co-wrote the film with Juliet Snowden is canny. It sets up things nicely for when the action starts to get a little more ectoplasmic. And thats where the film goes off the rails. The deliciously unsettling ambiguity of traditional Ouija board play -- characterized by accusations that one player is deliberately moving the planchette and the subsequent heated denials -- is replaced quickly by standard horror-movie tropes involving ghoulish apparitions zombie-like trances and violent ""Exorcist""-style telekinesis. Little is left to the imagination which is where all real horror lies. Of course certain adjustments were necessary in adapting the board game to the screen. As with ""Battleship"" which turned an exercise in strategic guesswork centered around a plastic pegboard into a sci-fi-flavored naval action flick ""Ouija"" is hampered by the fact that watching a bunch of people sitting around a table is not inherently cinematic. Hence the filmmakers have added a little fillip not included in the original Ouija board rules In the film if you look through the ""window"" of the planchette you actually can see dead people. That accommodation may be a necessary evil but it violates a dictum that any true fan of the Ouija board will acknowledge Whats seen only by the minds eye is far scarier than anything that Hollywood -- or Hasbro -- might try to sell us. Ouija   (99 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for frightening images mature thematic material and some violence. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Y.E.S. By Mick LaSalle Updated 1150 am Thursday October 23 2014 At a certain point in ""Ouija"" a terrible dread seizes the audience. This dread takes the form of a realization and the realization is that somebody is trying to sell you a Ouija board. Whats more theyre employing a peculiar marketing strategy or at least one that might sound peculiar to someone who knows nothing of human nature Buy this. It will kill you. So the Ouija board is quite the homicidal entity in ""Ouija"" a horror movie that borrows a little from this and a little from that but mostly borrows from the bank called boring. This is an 89-minute movie -- less if you factor in the time it takes to roll the credits --and even then it makes you wish the board or the spirits unleashed by the board would just kill everybody and get it over with. There are many ways to scare people in a horror movie but most of the ways fall into one of three categories (1) through loud noises (2) by constantly threatening to show you something really really disgusting and occasionally following through on the threat (3) by creating a psychological and existential universe that feels so hostile and threatens to reveal so much of the true nature of life that viewers will feel scared soul-sick and educated against their will. Pull off method No. 3 and you may create a classic. ""Ouija"" goes for option No. 1 and just creates a racket. They must have been laughing all over themselves recording the soundtrack attaching thunderous crashing chords to the most bland of sights in order to make an audience jump. Go up to people and without warning shout right into their face. Theyll jump too but that wont make you Steven Spielberg. ""Ouija"" has something wrong with it from the first five minutes. A girl goes to a friends house and asks her to accompany her to a party. The other girl is evasive doesnt want to go seems to have something on her mind. Finally the friend persuades her to tell her whats wrong. The girl begins Remember the Ouija board we used to play with as kids? What would you do -- what would anybody do -- if you asked a friend what was wrong and the friend started talking about a Ouija board? Wouldnt you want to hear the rest of that? But no. Instead the friend cuts her off calls her a ""spaz."" And later when the girl kills herself the friend doesnt even remember her mentioning a Ouija board. As far as the friend is concerned the suicide is out of nowhere. Olivia Cooke who seems to be an intelligent young actress -- English doing an American accent -- plays the best friend who gets the bright idea to contact the dead friend through ... well wild guess. From there its boilerplate. Make out your scorecard If youre really good youll not only be able to figure out who gets killed but in what order.

The spirit-summoning parlor toy has already been employed successfully in a number of quite good movies (The Exorcist and Paranormal Activity come to mind). Whats left for the dead to say? Not much it turns out. After model high-school senior Debbie (Shelley Hennig) mysteriously dies bestie Laine (Olivia Cooke) convenes a seance in hopes of reconnecting with her pal. The skeptical crew might as well have been playing Mad Libs because the interchangeable spooks they conjure are as stock as they come. If theres any salvation its that precious little effort is spent on the how or why of those supernatural shenanigans leaving time for the films ensemble of young people to lurk clumsily in the dark waiting for unexpected crashes to startle them and send your popcorn flying. A more self-conscious approach would have been to double down on those payoffs and toss in a bit more gore (coming on home video no doubt). Ultimately though this officially sanctioned version fails to conjure psychological thrills or many earnest scares. It says a lot that the grossest moment involves a character flossing--no gag just flossing. Likewise the candy stuck in your teeth will be the only thing that lingers after the credits roll.

Chaplin said hed show her stepping over the banana peel then disappearing into the manhole on the other side. That story flashed through my mind a couple of times during Ouija which at times enacts the horror-movie equivalent of Chaplins comedy gag. It builds to a jump scare and distracts us with what we think was the big sudden jump reveal -- and then it pounces. When it works its a wonderful elemental thing. Im not going to lie I actually cackled with terror and delight at a couple of moments. The story is absurdly simple. A young woman Debbie (Shelley Hennig) mysteriously dies after playing with a Ouija board. Her friends among them her BFF Laine (Olivia Cooke) attempt to commune with her spirit at which point eerie things start to happen including the appearance of the words ""Hi friend"" in various places -- carved into a wooden desk written on a car window scrawled on the wall of a dark tunnel that nobody should have come near in the first place -- I mean Jesus. As often happens it turns out the friends have managed to commune not with Debbie but with an older more troubled spirit. Or maybe two. Ill let you find out for yourselves. Ouija is confident meat-and-potatoes horror and thats a lot harder to pull off than it sounds. The film has plenty of cheap jump-scares -- usually theyre accompanied by the requisite musical body-blows on the soundtrack or shrieking sound-effects -- but it earns them honestly through the patient way it builds. Director Stiles White (a former F/X guy and screenwriter) has a precise clean style and knows how to direct our attention. Shadows appear on walls but we dont notice them until someone else notices them which somehow makes them scarier. So many horror movies these days begin deliberately but then get mired in a mess of shrill nonstop ante-upping. They dont seem to understand that a movie that doesnt try to blow the world apart -- that sticks to its style and its pacing -- can often be more frightening.Part of the films efficiency lies in its concept. The whole joy of playing with a spirit board is the promise of a glimpse into the beyond however absurd we may think such a glimpse may be. That collective overt buy-in -- of audience and of characters -- means the story unfolds in an atmosphere of tension that gears us up early on and never quite lets us go. Ouija isnt going to redefine the horror genre but sometimes its just nice to have a movie that knows what its doing and does it well.

Were it not for the omnipresence of smartphones and a scene where a character watches an expositionally helpful YouTube video the film could easily be a relic from back when Parker Brothers first flooded the toy market with Ouija boards in the 60s. None of the clean-cut teen stars in the cast smoke drink do drugs have sex or get even remotely nude (when one character is dispatched as shes drawing a bath shes still wearing her socks). Theres no real gore and nothing beyond what looks like a relatively minor effects budget so without the usual trappings of a pick-em-off scare flick Ouija has to rely on atmosphere and narrative. It excels at neither. To director Stiles Whites credit the movie takes its time building a world beginning with an opening sequence in which the hero Laine (Bates Motels Olivia Cooke) checks in on her troubled best pal Debbie (Shelly Hennig of MTVs Teen Wolf). Debbie and Laine played with the Ouija when they were kids and Debbie may have accidentally unleashed something sinister with it. Once the ground rules are established and it turns out that the spirit of a girl murdered in Debbies house decades ago is using our well-scrubbed crew as conduits for a resurrection (and knocking people off when she sees fit) the atmosphere created by White and cinematographer David Emmerichs falls away and focus shifts to the thudding script. The early part of Ouija has some creepy bits that thankfully dont rely on simple sound gags. And it has the decency to not be a found-footage movie. But once the plot machinations kick in it becomes kind of goofy even for a film about malevolent ghosts who possess people through a board game. Ouija is one of those movies where everything is easily solved even though those solutions are completely absurd and the climax relies on both the advice of a character we barely know and a totally dopey deus ex machina. Within the pungent field of other wide-release scare jobs and films derived from cardboard-based time-killers for kids Ouija stacks up relatively well thanks to its look and a confident performance by Cooke. That said its still best left on the shelf.

Douglas Smith left Ana Coto and Olivia Cooke in the movie ""Ouija."" (Matt Kennedy / Universal Pictures) Robert Abele Review Try as it might Ouija cant seem to scare up a good fright story based on the board game Pronounced like ""squeegee"" ""Ouija"" is a tie-in fright flick only a group of toy and movie executives could summon from around a conference table a blah imitation of PG-13 haunted house movies like ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Insidious.""Olivia Cooke stars as thoughtful high schooler Laine whose Ouija-loving bestie Debbie (Shelley Hennig) mysteriously kills herself after private time with the spirit-calling board game. Co-writer and director Stiles White keeps reminding us Dont play it alone Dont play it in a graveyard (Duh.) Always say ""Goodbye""A thousand dull scenes later Laine her boyfriend (Daren Kagasoff) sister (Ana Coto) and two pals (Bianca Santos Douglas Smith) fatally investigate in Debbies big creaky house with the old timey-looking board discovered in her attic. The ghost scenario that this boring CW-ready ""Scooby-Doo"" gang uncovers isnt nearly as shocking as the blase attitude they have toward friends dying off or that some know to call the games circular-windowed arrow a ""planchette."" Whether its a rule that people in board game adaptations have to read the instructions aloud ""Ouija"" is only a mystery as a promotional tool. If youre not scared you wont buy one.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 24 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 24 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Stiles White Written by Juliet Snowden and Stiles White Starring Olivia Cooke Ana Coto Bianca A. Santos Douglas Smith Matthew Settle and Shelly Hennig Classification 14A Country USA Language English The first rule of Ouija is to not play the game on your own. The first rule of scary movies is to have characters who tempt fate by breaking perfectly sound rules.Ouija is a modestly budgeted pre-Halloween film from a first-time director (Stiles White) who mostly sticks to rules but is fairly unambitious. Supernatural happenings and staccato scares basically. It is harmless frighty fun for teenage audiences but adults will leave theatres with their bejeebers intact. What we have is gang of photogenic high school pals who feel the need to contact a friend of theirs who had recently committed suicide. Given the title of the movie you shouldnt need to be told that Ouija a seance-facilitating board game is importantly involved. After all one doesnt need to be Marshall McLuhan to know that the medium is the message.Ouija for the uninitiated is a board with letters numbers and a few words with a pointing device to determine answers from dead people. Its basically texting from the other side and in film Ouija invariably spells trouble. At one point the dead girls best friend Elaine (Olivia Cooke) asks ""Is there a presence among us?"" Oh theres a presence all right. Its Hasbro the game-maker which has hopes of making money in the movie business. Game-board movies havent done so well though Battleship was a sinker and Clue didnt have one.You know who else doesnt have a clue? The grown-ups in Ouija. The parents of the dead girl understandably want to get out of town. Outrageously however they ask her best friend Elaine to look after their house while theyre gone. The house in which Elaines best friend just hanged herself. Who does that?Elaines father isnt much better. The mother isnt around and dad cheerily takes off on a business trip leaving Elaine and her gothy kid sister to fend for themselves. Those two kids fend well though. Friends are dying and dead people are willy-nilly but Elaine is remarkably composed as she attempts to close down the dark channel that had been opened. Good for her but heres the thing If shes not scared out of her mind why should we be? In the end Ouija the board game is Ouija the bored game.

"Ouija is just a bored game review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesOuija is just a bored game review Dull horror movie Ouija is a bloodless teen screamer based on a board game and engineered to help empty wallets of babysitting money through Halloween. By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Oct. 23 2014OuijaStarring Olivia Cooke Daren Kagasoff Douglas Smith Bianca Santos Ana Coto. Directed by Stiles White. 90 minutes. Opening Friday Oct. 24 at major theatres. 14AWhat to say about board game-inspired horror movie Ouija?The heart-shaped planchette guided by the spirits of movie lovers skitters frantically between ""No"" and ""Goodbye.""Article Continued BelowIts a bloodless and not very scary teen screamer carefully engineered to help empty wallets of babysitting money through Halloween. But with the box-office bomb Battleship there is growing evidence that perhaps board games dont make the best inspiration.From left Douglas Smith Olivia Cooke and Ana Coto play the board game Ouija in the unsurprising movie of the same name.Laine Morris (a quite capable Olivia Cooke) is distressed when her childhood best friend Debbie (Shelley Hennig) kills herself after an ill-advised solo session with the board. Not believing Debbie would die by her own hand Laine enlists a group of high school friends to use a Ouija board to contact her and get the real story.Laines boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff) her rebellious sis Sarah (Ana Coto) their pal Isabelle (Bianca A. Santos) and Debbies occasionally grief- stricken boyfriend Pete (Torontos Douglas Smith) soon find they have stirred up something wicked with their Ouija exploration.The friends are getting picked off one by one by some unseen force with a thing for dental floss. The danger of messing with the spiritual world and how to defeat it is explained by Laines Italian grandmother who arrives just in time to do laundry and warn them off contacting spirits. The rest of the adults have all conveniently skipped town.Scares are more of the Saturday morning cartoon variety cliched or telegraphed well in advance. A pool cover all but has a neon arrow pointing to it with a ""danger"" sign.With a story that seems to change on a whim and a clearly limited budget the gang soon finds out theres spectral danger afoot. Someone died in Debbies house and its up to Laine to do some Nancy Drew-like investigating which results in a quite satisfying encounter with a strange woman in a mental institution (Lin Shaye of the Insidious franchise).The final -- and very loud -- showdown points directly to producer Michael Bay. Ouija has been in the works for years as the project based on the Hasbro game was bounced amid directors screenwriters and studios finally landing with first-time director Stiles White who co-wrote this version of the script with Juliet Snowden.I do understand the lure of the Ouija board having hauled it out many preteen Saturday afternoons to sit in darkened basement rec rooms with giggling girlfriends asking ""the spirit world"" questions about boys and looking to contact dead great-grandparents. Then one of the mothers would holler downstairs to put that stupid thing away and go play outside.Same advice could apply to Ouija the movie.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Though technically a board game--making Ouija technically a board-game movie--the Ouija board as narrative device actually offers a lot of creative leeway. Once the characters have done the necessary first-act work of conjuring some evil thing or another with the board the filmmakers have the opportunity to take the story in any direction they want an opportunity that is wasted here. Ouija feels like a film made under contractual obligation which--considering it experienced a few false starts before making it to theaters in its current significantly downsized form--could very well be the case. Its professionally produced but completely uninspired.Blame can be placed at least partially on the script written by genre specialists and frequent co-collaborators Juliet Snowden and Stiles White. The story is formulaic to the point of laziness with events unfolding seemingly because thats whats supposed to happen in a horror movie. This results in huge narrative leaps unresolved plot points and baffling character arcs. (Take the character of Nona We see her picking up socks and shes not a family member so shes presumably the cleaning lady. But shes also the demon-killing expert our heroines turn to facilitating the transition to the third act because their town apparently has no sympathetic priests or professors of the occult.) Everything is just so convenient in Ouija--of course the first thing Laine (Olivia Cooke) decides to take from her dead best friends room is a Ouija board even though they havent played with it since they were kids. Of course she hasnt forgotten any of the rules of the game or words to the invocation in that time. And of course dearly departed Debbie (Shelley Hennig) left behind hours of video of her discovering and then playing with the board. All these things happen because they are narratively efficient no more no less.The cast also isnt doing much to sell the material. The teen protagonists are all cut from the same CW-ready cloth alternately squinty (for the guys) and wide-eyed (for the girls). Bates Motels Olivia Cooke is disappointing in the lead role delivering emotional lines like ""I never got to say goodbye"" in a disinterested deadpan. (She might as well end every sentence with ""or whatever."") Even the presence of veteran character actor Lin Shaye known most recently as the medium from the Insidious movies in a small role feels less like a loving homage a la Barbara Crampton in Youre Next and more like a happy accident. Pretty much all the scares in Ouija are of the tawdry jump-scare variety but for what they are they arent bad. The key seance scene is actually pretty spooky and even if viewers see the kills coming a mile away (the audience at this screening certainly did) that shouldnt dull their cheap impact. Whats more likely to lessen the effect is the movies PG-13 rating which automatically precludes any moments of real terror. Ouija does give an unusual amount of screen time to its creature effects a probable byproduct of director Stiles Whites background working for Stan Winston Studios. However again the movie wastes an opportunity by applying expert makeup skills to a cliched spooky little dead girl the character design of which is more than a little reminiscent of similar entities in The Conjuring. Thats not to overstate the extent to which Ouija rips off other movies though because that would imply the filmmakers were coming from a place of overly enthusiastic fandom.So what was the motivation for making Ouija? To serve as an ad for Ouija boards presumably. Yet this movie is a terrible ad for Ouija boards ""based on the Hasbro game Ouija"" title card and throwaway ""they sell these things at toy stores"" line notwithstanding. ""Hey teens"" the movie says. ""You know those Ouija-board things available at a retailer near you? Play with one and all your friends will die"" Hardly the type of message to make a sane person want to run out and buy one. But Ouija isnt a good movie for thinking although (for those well out of the movies target demographic) with a few friends at a late-night screening its probably a good movie for drinking.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 643 p.m. EDT October 24 2014From left Pete (Douglas Smith) Laine (Olivia Cooke) and Sarah (Ana Coto) in a scene from the motion picture ""Ouija.""(Photo Matt Kennedy Universal Pictures)Nothing very spirited happens in Ouija a deadly dull and overly familiar movie about summoning ghosts that draws upon nearly every horror movie cliche. ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday night in select cities and Friday nationwide.)Even if the Ouija board accessory is shoehorned into the picture youve seen this movie before. Many times. Its essentially the story of evil spirits emanating from a dead person in a haunted house and terrorizing teenagers. Laine (Olivia Cooke) and Debbie (Shelley Hennig) are lifelong best friends. Some of their childhood time involved playing with a Ouija board. Whose didnt?USA TODAYAnnabelle joins ranks of freaky dolls in horror filmsFlash forward and all signs point to Debbie having killed herself. But Laine refuses to believe it. Besides she reasons Debbie played on the Ouija board solo flouting one of a few cardinal rules for Ouija enthusiasts. (The other two include not playing in a graveyard and always saying ""goodbye."") Laine convinces her boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff) her sister Sarah (Ana Coto) pal Isabelle (Bianca A. Santos) and Debbies boyfriend Pete (Douglas Smith) to try to summon Debbies spirit through the Ouija board she finds in her friends bedroom. Lights suddenly flash on. Or off. Doors open creakily. Or slam shut. A gas stove mysteriously flares on. A chair slides out. Standard stuff. The five teens dont react much. Neither will the audience.USA TODAYAnnabelle merely toys with genuine horrorThe rest of the convoluted tale makes little sense but does incorporate more horror-movie staples like a creepy doll in the attic and an old lady in an insane asylum (Lin Shaye) who attempts to explain things. Creepily of course since shes in an insane asylum. Apparently Laine has opened a spirit portal. No good can come from that. Ouija is all cheap jolts and no real spookiness. Ghostly images appear occasionally amid excessive exposition. But the movie commits the cardinal sin for horror flicks Its not frightening. Its a tedious and familiar teen drama -- friends are grieving parents are clueless. And the main five characters are of course shockingly dim about avoiding scary places or potential danger.Perhaps the only thing that stands out is a malevolent forces disturbingly creative use of dental floss. Four out of five dentists would not approve. USA TODAYWick has a short fuse - and too many weaponsBut when it comes to that familiar piece of polished wood with the letters and numbers on it not much is going on.Anyone who has ever played with a Ouija board knows that the game itself is hardly riveting. Repeated shots of teenage fingers on the planchette moving around the board are stiflingly dull.A few incantations are boringly intoned. Questions are posed. But much-needed suspense is glaringly absent. Characters dont seem to react appropriately to what is going on. Laine and Sarahs grandmother (Vivis Colombetti) suddenly becomes an expert in all things Ouija about two-thirds of the way through the movie. The story doesnt even bother to adhere to its own sloppy logic as events grow increasingly monotonous or pointless. When we first meet Debbie shes been noodling around with a Ouija board she found while cleaning the attic. (Is there a teenager on earth who willingly cleans an attic?) Apparently by dusting it off she awakened the dark powers of this ""ancient spirit board."" Those powers seem entirely focused on these teens perhaps in punishment for all the stupid things they do like walking into dark rooms without switching on lights venturing into musty crawl spaces and creepy basements and holding seances. The game is just a tool to make yet another movie about evil spirits and demonic presences.But didnt 2012s Battleship decisively prove board games simply dont make good movies?Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare After the death of a friend a group of friends must confront their most terrifying fears when they awaken the dark powers of an ancient spirit board.

(universal) BY Jordan Hoffman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 23 2014 119 PM Title Ouija Film Info With Olivia Cooke Douglas Smith. Creepy board game makes frighteningly boring movie. Director Stiles White (129). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. Squeezing a movie out of a Oujia board is not necessarily a bad idea. For those whove played with that spooky old board the nervous tension felt as the wooden planchette creaks toward a letter makes for some frightening fun (is that our hands moving toward letters or a spirit ?). Indeed the moments in ""Ouija"" dedicated to teens using the board have a nice giddy tension. The grafting of another rote plot however is as dull as reading Parker Brothers instructions. The good-lookin chums -- all unknowns including Olivia Cooke Douglas Smith and Ana Coto -- connect with a supernatural meanie through a game thats been up in the attic since before tablets were invented and they meet a cruel end. The madness will stop only when a tortured soul on the Other Side is granted peace. Cooke a young Brit seen on TVs ""Bates Motel"" is strong as the diminutive brunette at the center of the interworldly fright-fest. Her charisma is almost enough to keep you from rolling your eyes at the script. Shelley Hennig in Ouija (universal) Few will find themselves engaged in what happens to the throwaway characters. But if youre going a group movie outing might work best if only to share the shouts. Director Stiles White never met an unmotivated jump-scare he didnt like. There are countless instances where the kids turn corners to find lurkers in the dark as booms fill the soundtrack. Like playing with a Ouija board its meaningless but it helps if you gather a few friends.

""Ouija"" ""Ouija"" ""Ouija"" ""Ouija"" ""Ouija"" Gone are the days when the Halloween season guaranteed a new ""Paranormal Activity"" movie and before that a new ""Saw.""With ugly doll ""Annabelle"" thankfully on her way out of theaters and back into the toy chest the sole trick-or-treat-friendly vehicle in theaters is ""Ouija.""Hasbros classic board game Ouija purports to allow players to make contact with the dead. Here in the big-screen version BFFs Debbie (Shelley Hennig) and Laine (Olivia Cooke) dabble with a Ouija board as little girls and as a teenager Debbie is still at it like most teen girls these days. But this time around her dealings with the Ouija board arent so innocuous leading to fatal results.Laine and her barely distinguishable friends Trevor (Daren Kagasoff) Isabelle (Bianca Santos) and Pete (Douglas Smith) and her sister Sara (Ana Coto) use the Ouija board to contact their dead friend Debbie. But they get more than they signed up for instead conjuring up -- wait for it -- evil spirits.Theres screaming apparitions that pop up here and there some creepy-cool imagery of characters with their lips sewn shut and more as the group gets knocked off one by one in typical bloodless PG-13 fashion. Lin Shayne known to modern horror fans for her role in ""Insidious"" is on hand to provide some answers as a long-locked-away mental patient but not the type the teens are looking for.Apparently only Ouija can give those answers -- theres barely a trace of parents teachers or counselors in this mix. Directed by Stiles White whose credits lean more heavily in the special-effect arenas ""Ouija"" is bland safe horror for those who like their scares nonexistent.And whats the point of that? If the real thought behind ""Ouija"" is to revive interest in the old board game just in time for a splashy holiday season reboot thats just as laughable as the movie itself.What ""Ouija""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 130  Content Disturbing violence frightening horror images and thematic material Kevin C.

Photo Universal Studios MOVIE REVIEW Ouija Running time 90 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence disturbing images). At the Empire the Union Square others. If nothing else this Halloween offering from director Stiles White (and produced by Michael Bay) is entirely sincere in its desire to scare people. Two best friends once played with a Ouija board when they were little girls. Now Laine (Olivia Cooke) and Debbie (Shelley Hennig) are teenagers and Debbie is still playing with the thing. In the way of all horror movies poor Debbie meets a terrible fate. Its the fault of the spirits called up by the board of course. Grieving Laine becomes determined to contact Debbie and she coaxes her bad-girl sister Sarah (Ana Coto) and friends (Daren Kagasoff Bianca A. Santos and Douglas Smith) to go with her to Debbies creepy deserted house for a nice little session with her deceased pals favorite toy. This is one need hardly add a big mistake. Despite the embarrassing ""Based on the Game by Hasbro"" end credit which doesnt exactly suggest youve just taken a trip to the dark side a Ouija board is no worse than most other horror-movie premises. Shelley Hennig as Debbie in ""Ouija.""Photo Universal Studios And ""Ouija"" looks fine with its carefully styled actors its obligatory gingerbread Victorian house and a bunch of unreliable light fixtures throwing shadows everywhere. Its endearing how this glorified haunted-house movie tries to reclaim all the old tools and do so with a straight face and a PG-13 level of violence. Among the familiar tropes that ""Ouija"" resurrects the spirit-haunted person who decides to stay alone in the house the fake-out jump where a terrifying shadow turns out to be nothing the elderly person from the old country who warns the kids not to unleash these powers the amped-up sound effects that make pulling out a chair sound like a battleship weighing anchor. Depending on how jaded you are a lot of these old tricks still work. By virtue of a cast that ranges from pretty good (Cooke and Coto) to not-all-that-irritating and a director who is happy to play up the autumnal atmosphere its fun for most of the running time. The denouement involving a very game Lin Shaye sinking every last molar into the scenery is absurd. But once youve accepted the idea that Hasbro holds the key to the afterlife absurd is a feature not a bug.

Treehouse of Horror Unites Modern-Day Simpsons With Their 1980s Counterparts 10 of Hollywoods Creepiest Demon Dolls (Photos) Theres no taking this witchboard business seriously for a second but as PG-13 fright flicks for tweens go signs point to a few decent scares and at least one good idea You kids today -- it used to be that if you wanted Rice Krispies treats at a slumber party you had to make them yourself instead of buying them pre-wrapped off the shelf. And if you wanted to scare yourself and your friends with a little flavor of the occult you had to actually play with a Ouija board instead of popping in the eventual ""Ouija"" DVD that will no doubt become a staple of tween get-togethers. ""Ouija"" seems to be an odd choice for toy magnate Hasbros movie division throughout the film our young heroes are warned not to play with the board and are told time and again to destroy the thing. If the idea is to move more units among young consumers for Hasbro the films main goal is to portray the letterboard-and-spanner set as something that can actually commune with the dead with the added benefit of also annoying your parents. See video Game of Ouija Turns Deadly in First Trailer for Michael Bay-Produced Horror Flick (Video) Mind you ""Ouija"" is safely PG-13 so any encounters with the other side are never as grisly as they would be in say a new ""Hellraiser"" sequel. And even though the movie relies heavily on the SUDDENLY LOUD jump-scare for the first half or so first-time director Stiles White (who also co-wrote with Juliet Snowden) dredges up some appropriately creepy imagery and plot twists that work within the framework of the kid-friendly rating. Before the opening credits we see teen Debbie (Shelley Hennig ""Teen Wolf"") playing Ouija on her own despite a flashback in which young Debbie tells her BFF Laine never to use the board solo. Debbie kills herself and the grief-stricken Laine (Olivia Cooke ""Bates Motel"") gathers her boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager"") her sister Sarah (Ana Coto) Debbies beau Pete (Douglas Smith ""Big Love"") and friend Isabelle (Bianca Santos ""The Fosters"") to say goodbye using the mystical toy. (Despite the title the implement is almost never referred to as a ""Ouija board"" in the film with characters calling it ""the board"" or a ""spirit board"" instead. Almost every shot features ""OUIJA"" in big letters across the top however so Hasbro cant say they didnt get their marketing moneys worth.) Also read Ouija Board Predicts Box Office Teen Thriller to Beat Brad Pitt Keanu Reeves Bill Murray Naturally the kids soon discover that theyve tampered with forces beyond their ken and its up to Laine to figure who killed Debbie (and whos coming after her close friends one by one). The script lazily offers up a wise older Latina character (played by Vivis) to furrow her brow with concern and provide convenient intel about mucking about with the spirit world. (Theres also another character with intimate knowledge about whats been going on in Debbies house played in a cameo appearance by an actress who has made a second career out of juicing up dopey horror movies.) Also read Miles Tellers Whiplash Breaks Horror Mold for Producer Jason Blum Given its double burden of being both a toy adaptation and a bloodless kiddie horror show ""Ouija"" winds up being more fun than you might think even if its the sort of film you cant really take seriously for a second. A handful of creepy scenes and at least one decent surprise should be enough to make less-demanding fright fans move their fingers (and their ticket money) to ""YES."" Breaking News To Your Inbox.

After all what teenager hasnt spent at least one night with his or her friends trying to scare themselves silly contacting the dead? Unfortunately Universals low-budget quickie aimed at young audiences hopelessly squanders the opportunity being less scary than landing in jail while playing Monopoly. Profits are assured in this current undemanding horror movie marketplace when even a mediocrity like Annabelle can become a major hit and Hasbro will certainly reap the benefits just in time for the holiday season. But creatively speaking Ouija is dead on arrival. The films plot is set in motion when teenage golden girl Debbie (Shelley Hennig) finds an antique Ouija game in her home and makes the cardinal mistake of playing it alone. She not surprisingly winds up dead shortly thereafter an apparent suicide and her grieving friends decide to attempt to contact her in the time-honored tradition. The group led by the intrepid Laine (Olivia Cooke) seems to hit pay dirt at first getting in contact with a spirit calling itself ""DZ."" But afterwards things become spooky when each receives the same message ""Hi friend"" transmitted in various forms including the inevitable flashing computer screen. And the spirit soon turns murderous dispatching her victims in gruesome ways including in an imaginative conceit that will surely not please the dentistry profession death by dental floss. Read More Box Office Preview Ouija Calls on Spirits to Defeat Gun-Toting Keanu Reeves Laines search for answers leads her to a former resident of Debbies home Paulina (Lin Shaye) now confined in a forbidding mental institution. The elderly woman informs her that the spirit she and her friends contacted was not in fact Debbie but rather ... well better not to spoil the films few wan surprises. In the absence of anything truly original in the screenplay he co-wrote with Juliet Snowden director Stiles White vainly attempts to ratchet up the tension with a series of cheap jump scares fueled by loud noises that are the cinematic equivalent of shaking hands with someone wearing a joy buzzer. At the preview screening attended the technique produced the inevitable screams quickly followed by bursts of laughter which at least had the effect of relieving the torpor of the sluggishly paced proceedings. The photogenic young ensemble composed of television veterans including Douglas Smith (Big Love) Bianca Santos (The Fosters) and Hennig (Days of Our Lives) fails to make much of an impression with the exception of Cooke so impressive in AMCs Bates Motel who seems destined for bigger and better things. The true standout is Shaye (the younger sister of New Line Cinema founder Robert Shaye) whos genuinely creepy as the wheelchair-bound mental patient with a secret agenda. Read More Board Games Attack in New Ouija Trailer ""Do not go seeking answers from the dead"" warns a concerned elderly character at one point in the film. That advice naturally goes unheeded by the reckless teens as it certainly will by impressionable younger viewers who will no doubt rush out to buy their own Ouija boards and later line up for this intended franchise starters inevitable sequels.

Its the rare Hasbro/Michael Bay production that may actually dissuade audiences from buying the product its selling but aside from that rather charming distinction ""Ouija"" is fairly routine stuff. A tale of two teenage sisters their very expendable friends and the creepy board game that just wont leave them alone this silly but straight-faced supernatural thriller manages to elicit an occasional shudder in between cheap jolts and false scares emerging as a feat of competent direction (by debuting helmer Stiles White) over derivative scripting (by White and writing partner Juliet Snowden). Friendly box office spirits are already smiling upon Universals Oct. 24 release and should continue to hover at least through Halloween weekend. ""Calm down its only a game"" whispers young Debbie (Claire Beale) as she introduces her terrified friend Laine (Afra Tully) to the mysteries of Ouija using a heart-shaped planchette and an ornate board etched with letters and numbers to communicate with the spirit realm. But as anyone whos seen ""The Exorcist"" the ""Witchboard"" movies or any number of other occult chillers could tell you Ouija is a game you play at your peril -- a lesson that the teenage Debbie (Shelley Hennig) is destined to learn the hard way. After carelessly engaging in a solo session with the board which is apparently about as smart as talking about Fight Club she goes into a weird trance and hangs herself with a string of Christmas lights. For horror-savvy viewers the image of Debbie dangling from the ceiling may suggest a bloodless homage to Dario Argentos classic ""Suspiria"" but the rest of ""Ouija"" falls somewhere between a tween-friendly version of ""The Conjuring"" and a live-action episode of ""Scooby-Doo."" Determined to find out why her happy well-adjusted best friend killed herself Laine (Olivia Cooke ""Bates Motel"") hits upon the brilliant-stupid idea of using the board to contact Debbie inviting their respective boyfriends (Daren Kagasoff Douglas Smith); their close gal-pal Isabelle (Bianca Santos); and Laines sullen sister Sarah (Ana Coto) to participate in a nighttime seance at the scene of the crime. Soon enough the usual paranormal portents emerge and its not just the Ouija board that starts acting of its own accord Stoves light up doors open and close dental floss takes on terrifying new properties and lights flicker on and off with ominous frequency suggesting a call to either an exorcist or an electrician might be in order. As the body count rises and the planchettes movements become increasingly frenzied Laine begins experiencing ghastly visions of a young girl and her mother whose souls have clearly not been laid to rest (their rotting visages brought to impressively freaky life by special-effects makeup artist Mike Smithson) ushering in an obligatory murder-in-retrospect backstory that while not particularly complicated has the effect of making Laine and her comrades seem even more underdeveloped by comparison. Clearly White and Snowden (whose recent writing credits include the exorcism thriller ""The Possession"" and the Nicolas Cage vehicle ""Knowing"") are trying to pare down the plot to a barer-than-bare minimum -- as evidenced by the way they quickly introduce characters like Laines dad (Matthew Settle) and Debbies mom (Robyn Lively) only to hurry them out of town like unwanted chaperones. Far from seeming efficient the storytelling merely feels sluggish and noncommittal; theres so little in the way of connective tissue its more jarring than it should be when the characters are forced to acknowledge casualty after casualty (""I miss them all the time"" says one none too convincingly) or when Laines grandmother (Vivis) periodically emerges from nowhere to issue dire warnings about contacting the dead. As has become the norm with so much contemporary horror most of the scares in ""Ouija"" are gimmicky and repetitive ""gotcha"" moments owing more to d.p. David Emmerichs whip pans and a series of ear-splitting thwacks and shrieks than to any deeper more psychologically grounded shivers. Still White a longtime special-effects maven before he and Snowden shifted into screenwriting demonstrates a reasonable grasp of how to use silence and stillness to build tension and atmosphere and every so often he strikes an effective note of dread -- sometimes even in broad daylight where a simple bike ride through an empty tunnel can raise a surprising amount of gooseflesh. Anchoring a mixed-bag younger cast Cooke makes an engaging enough heroine managing to seem more likable than exasperating even when shes doing things like taking refuge in a dark closet climbing by herself into a dusty attic or crawling her way into an underground burial chamber. Ably stealing her two scenes as a wheelchair-bound mental patient with some unexpected advice for Laine Lin Shaye (a fixture of the ""Insidious"" horror franchise) achieves something the rest of ""Ouija"" only intermittently manages turning cliches into horror-movie gold.
