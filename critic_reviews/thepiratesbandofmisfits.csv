"Claymation adventure The Pirates only half baked |       NJ.com comments Claymation adventure The Pirates only half baked Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 27 2012 at 830 AM View/Post Comments Aardman Animation for Sony Pictures AnimationThe Pirate Captain voiced by Hugh Grant. When it comes to cheeky historical revisionism British filmmakers have Hollywood beat. Yes this June brings ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter."" But in that movie Honest Abe is the hero (and the cruel bloodsuckers actually work as a neat metaphor for parasitical plantation owners). The new ""The Pirates Band of Misfits"" however takes far bigger risks by making Queen Victoria the villain. A pretty mad villain too with popping eyes steel-plated petticoats and an obsession with pirates. As far as beloved national icons go its a little like someone making a Colonial ""Night of Ye Living Dead"" -- and having George Washington as one of the brain-munching zombies. But for all its rude Britannia attitude ""The Pirates Band of Misfits"" still doesnt quite work. Based on two books from a childrens series -- hence the clumsy title -- the film is from our old friends at Aardman who came up with the delightful Wallace and Gromit shorts and have spent the last decade or so pretty much winning all the animation Oscars that Pixar didnt. Over their last few films though theyve altered their approach concentrating on features (even though they dont always have the material to fill them out) and hiring movie stars to do the characters voices. Both changes make sense commercially. Neither has helped them artistically. The story here apart from being a bit sloppy (its mad mix of history could make teachers weep) isnt engaging. Even with a ""Pirate of the Year"" contest an encounter with Charles Darwin and an endangered-animals message theres just not enough going on. And although Hugh Grant is the supposed draw as the dully named Captain Pirate hes all wrong for the part. The point is that the buccaneer is a bit of a fop; the joke would be to cast not the similar vocally elegant Grant but a rough-hewn opposite like Brendan Gleeson (who actually has a smaller part in the film as ""Pirate With Gout""). But Grant adds nothing surprising to the dialogue and Gleeson is wasted. As are most of the rest of the vocal talent including Salma Hayek as a sexy pirate queen. (Only Imelda Staunton as the ferocious Queen Vic actually creates a character.) Of course some of the Aardman magic remains. Even though its had some computer help the frame-by-frame clay work is still inspiring. The animators are still at their best with animals too with the funniest character in the whole film being Mr. Bobo Darwins man ... er chimpservant. The artists are also good at hiding lots of little gags in the frame mostly in posters ballots and other bits of printed ephemera. And there are a few surprisingly dark adult jokes. (How many times have you seen a childrens film with a leprosy gag?) But there arent enough jokes and the films two big chase scenes -- once an Aardman trademark -- feel like lets-get-through-this obligations. The filmmakers have said they are already dreaming up a sequel. They neednt hurry. Whatever treasures these pirates have are well buried. Ratings note The film contains violence and some mildly rude humor. The Pirates Band of Misfits (PG) Columbia (88 min.) Directed by Peter Lord Jeff Newitt. With the voices of Hugh Grant Brendan Gleeson. Now playing in New Jersey.

The revolutionary scientist kept a chimpanzee manservant liked big butts and could in fact lie if it meant getting all up in one. So what will get Charles (voiced by David Tennant) the glory -- and girlfriend -- that he so desperately seeks? A rare dodo bird maybe the last one being mistaken for a big-boned parrot by the scallywag likes of pirate captain Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant). The Captain himself is looking for a different kind of booty though to fund his candidacy for the Pirate of the Year awards. Can both men achieve their goals even when it means venturing into London home of the pirate-hating Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton)? Thats the twisty narrative behind Aardmans latest gloriously irreverent outing The Pirates Band of Misfits (more aptly titled in the U.K. as The Pirates In an Adventure with Scientists). As one might imagine silliness reigns supreme as our motley crew -- including The Pirate with a Scarf (Martin Freeman) The Pirate with Gout (Brendan Gleeson) The Albino Pirate (Anton Yelchin) and The Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate (Ashley Jensen plus a fake beard) -- cherish their ""Ham Nites"" above any actual pillaging under the command of a captain who doesnt know the actual word for ""cannons."" A fitting union between the animation studios stop-motion techniques made famous by Wallace amp; Gromit and its computer-generated side used in full for last years Arthur Christmas Pirates marks the return of Aardman co-founder Peter Lord to directorial duties (shared with Jeff Newitt) some twelve years after he helmed the adorable Chicken Run. Nearly every frame is crammed with wonderful background details (the crest for the Royal Society of Scientists boasts that theyve been ""Playing God Since"" we missed the year) some of which are given their full due during the end credits and conventional sight gags abound. If you ever wondered how a ship leaves those little red trails on a great big map in the movies youre about to find out and if youre worried that todays cartoons dont have enough jokes at John Merricks expense then just you wait. Grants voice work effortlessly personifies the Captains dimwitted swagger and wounded pride -- not that its saying a whole lot given Did You Hear About the Morgans? but its easily his most charming performance in a good five years -- while Tennant Staunton and Yelchin respectively do underhanded menacing and impossibly earnest very well. The whole of The Pirates flies by in under ninety minutes even working in a Flight of the Conchords number at one point and its all so charming that ones willing to overlook the fact that A) the climax is essentially the same showdown featured in Lords own Chicken Run and B) the aforementioned silent simian sidekick Dr. Bobo is basically Gromit given index cards. But to paraphrase a certain man with a certain luxuriant beard its only impossible to enjoy if you stop to think about it.

The latest Aardman Animations adventure is silly enough for kids and smart enough for their parents but it gets a bit frantic by the end Pirates are right up there with vampires werewolves and people saying ""LOL"" out loud on the list of Played-Out Pop Culture Phenomena but leave it to the folks at Aardman Animation to find the remaining reservoirs of fun in a bunch of seafaring scalawags. Whether youre besotted with peglegs or sick to death of skulls and crossbones theres a good chance youll find yourself enchanted by ""The Pirates Band of Misfits."" Fans of previous Aardman ventures like the ""Wallace and Gromit"" films will recognize many of the studios trademark laugh magnets -- droll non-talking animals and those wide clenched-teeth smiles that last just a second too long -- but ""The Pirates"" feels like a technological step forward not only in the films densely-populated world (of stop-motion animated figures) but also in the rolling waves of the ocean. This movie does for water what first-wave CGI features like ""Shrek"" did for fur and feathers. The rollicking plot follows the good-natured but somewhat dim Pirate Captain (voiced by Hugh Grant) whos not particularly good at pillage and mayhem but makes up for it with stirring sea shanties and a very popular weekly Ham Night aboard ship. He wants desperately to win the coveted Pirate of the Year trophy so he starts attacking boats only to find himself face-to-face with lepers schoolchildren and ghosts none of whom are carrying much gold. Theres not much money to be found aboard the HMS Beagle either but passenger Charles Darwin (David Tennant) realizes that the Captains prized pet Polly isnt a chubby parrot but rather the last surviving Dodo bird. Darwin convinces the Captain to come with him to London to present the creature -- and to be showered with riches -- over the objections of the Captains Number Two (Martin Freeman) who worries that returning to England will put the crew at risk of arrest by the virulently pirate-hating Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton). The usual kid-movie messages about friendship and loyalty get trotted out but its a testament to screenwriter Gideon DeFoe (adapting his childrens book ""The Pirates An Adventure with Scientists"") that the moral of the story never overcomes the jokes. And the jokes are plentiful here from the ""strangely curvaceous"" pirate (Ashley Jensen) whos clearly a lady in a fake beard to the Captain and his crews propensity for ridiculous disguises (as scientists Girl Scouts etc.) to references to Jane Austen and the Elephant Man that will soar far over kids heads. The voice cast is terrific -- Grant hasnt been this dryly funny in ages -- but if theres a downside to ""Pirates"" its that things get a bit too frantic by the end. They might have cut back on one set piece one frenzied chase to let the movie breathe a little. But even if its not as perfectly paced as say Aardmans recent ""Arthur Christmas"" ""The Pirates Band of Misfits"" gives pop-culture pirates a snazzy new eye-patch to wear on the high seas.

Aardman Animations for Sony Pict In this film image released by Sony Pictures Pirate with a Scarf voiced by Martin Freeman left and Pirate Captain voiced by Hugh Grant are shown in a scene from ""The Pirates Band of Misfits."" (AP Photo/Aardman Animation for Sony Pictures Animation) For parents some of the most entertaining animated movies -- ""Shrek"" ""Rango"" ""The Incredibles"" -- include a level of humor aimed at adults while still keeping kids laughing. Its a relief when filmmakers remember that grown-ups have to sit through these movies too.""The Pirates Band of Misfits"" goes one step further. It tips the scales to favor adults over children.The 3-D movie spends little time at sea and while the pirates go ashore to outsmart an intellectual and battle a cruel queen. The result is an odd combination of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ""Wallace and Gromit"" Monty Python and middle school science class. The Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) longs to win Pirate of the Year but he faces tough competition. He doesnt have nearly the booty of the others vying for the title and doesnt get much help from his motley crew. In his efforts to win the award he attacks several ships but returns with little treasure. Then he strikes another vessel the Barnacle and meets Charles Darwin (David Tennant). The scientist quickly realizes that the pirates beloved parrot is actually a rare dodo bird.Darwin wants to present the bird to the Royal Society. The Pirate Captain agrees to help with the plan and expects a big monetary prize. So while the Clashs ""London Calling"" plays on the soundtrack the crew heads to the city for the judging. ""Pirates"" has funny moments -- especially from Darwins silent henchman a monkey named Mr. Bobo who is much smarter than his lovelorn boss -- and director Peter Lords stop-motion animation is a work of art. But the movie is missing the zippy chases and lovable characters of Aardman studios previous films (""Arthur Christmas"" ""Chicken Run""). It has darker elements the foreboding streets of London the pirate-hating Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton) and a would-be executioner. This pirate tale is a misguided adventure that doesnt fully set sail.""The Pirates Band of Misfits""Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 130  Content Mild action rude humor and some language Videos Watch a trailer for The Pirates Band of Misfits Apr 26 2012 (...)

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 27 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Chapter I The Funny Buccaneer Having been asked to write particulars about stop-motion/CG-animated 3-D film The Pirates Band of Misfits keeping nothing back but for spoilers and only because its chockablock with comedy treasure I go back to a time (2003) when Gideon Defoe took up his pen on a lark to write The Pirates In an Adventure with Scientists. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new animated comedy ""The Pirates Band of Misfits"" Movies The Pirates Band of Misfits The official trailer ""This is the berth for me"" said Defoe then a recent Oxford anthropology grad working in a London grog shop. And indeed he has now logged four more Pirates novels. The stories tickled Aardman animation studio co-founder Peter Lord convincing him to helm a feature for the first time since Chicken Run (2000). Irreverently silly stories they are about a pirate captain named Pirate Captain - a damp squib but unsinkably blithe and popular (to his crew). Rather than trim his novel the custom for adaptations Defoe expanded the Scientists story with bits from his other books and new characters. He also freshened the comedy with a running vinegar-and-baking-soda gag and better anachronisms. Methinks he watched a lot of Monty Python as a younker. Chapter II Sea Dogs at the ""Barnacles Face"" A tall man with a luxuriant beard love of ham and gift for errors in judgment Pirate Captain sounds like Hugh Grant talking lower. Its jolly good. The rum crew may disagree about looting and cutlasses but they are loyal to a man - or woman in the case of Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate (Ashley Jensen) whose fake beard fools no one but the crew. Pirate With a Scarf the lone voice of reason (Martin Freeman) advises Captain against his ridiculous schemes to no avail. At the Barnacles Face tavern more plunder-full pirates like Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) humiliate Captain when he enters the Pirate of the Year contest. More doubloons are needed. Chapter II The Treasure Hunt With the CG-rendered high seas rolling behind Captains ship - one of many gloriously detailed sets worth pausing to examine if you capture the DVD - the crew sallies forth. After a montage of booty-less boats they board the vessel of Charles Darwin (David Tennant) who saves himself from the plank by pointing out the crews beloved Polly (newly hatched for the film) is not a parrot but a dodo. Thought to be extinct the bird could win Darwin the Scientific Discovery Prize in London. But the trophy-hungry Captain has other ideas. Chapter III Madcap Shore Adventure Things get destroyed when Darwin and his ""man-panzee"" butler Bobo attempt to kidnap Polly in a signature Aardman slapstick sequence. Things get surreal when Captain poorly disguised as a scientist amazes the crowd of real scientists with a bizarre show. One excited chap says the dodo discovery ""makes electricity look like a pile of crap."" But the spoils of his victory are not what Captain had in mind. Chapter IV The Attack of the Killer Queen Defoes other new character is a young stout but nimble Queen Victoria one of the most terrifying villainesses in animation history -which is saying a lot. The voice performance of Imelda Staunton oozes with wicked energy. The pirate-hating monarch enacts an elaborate and distasteful plan which sets the pirates adventure on a different course - the outrageous twists hilarious sitcom-paced patter and fantastic action I leave you to discover for yourself. Chapter V Not Quite the Last Of Pirate Captain we may hear more; he is wanted for a sequel. It may only happen if the films thoroughly British style of absurd humour connects with North American audiences. Designed to please all generations of irreverent humour-lovers The Pirates Band of Misfits may not be heart-warming (it is about nasty scurvy pirates) but its breezy rollicking fun.

Photo Credit Sony Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The adventures of a clueless pirate captain his obese parrot and Charles Darwin. BOTTOM LINE This brainy zany treat may have adults laughing harder than kids though the inventive claymation should please all viewers. CAST Hugh Grant Imelda Staunton Martin Freeman. LENGTH 128 You may laugh more than the child who brought you to ""The Pirates Band of Misfits"" a subtly screwball animated comedy with a distinctively British wit. Packed with meta-jokes and think-fast historical references ""Pirates"" will come as a brainy zany treat for parents though kids may feel their hair rustle as the literate one-liners sail over their heads. Based on a novel by screenwriter Gideon Defoe and claymated by the geniuses at Aardman (""Wallace amp; Gromit"") ""Pirates"" is basically a family-friendly version of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" with the knights transformed into seafarers. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Among the self-spoofing characters are Pirate With a Scarf (Martin Freeman) Albino Pirate (Anton Yelchin) and Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate (Ashley Jensen) whose obvious identity remains a mystery to everyone but us. Their leader Pirate Captain played by a pitch-perfect Hugh Grant in his first animated feature owes more than a little to Graham Chapmans vain clueless King Arthur. The plot centers on the 1837 Pirate of the Year Award a trade-association honor typically won by flashier more booty-ful types (listen for Salma Hayek and Jeremy Piven in small roles). This year when a captured Charles Darwin (David Tennant) points out that the ships weird-looking parrot is actually an extinct dodo the Captain becomes the latest toast of London. But this also draws unwanted attention from Queen Victoria an iron-corseted psychopath with the hilariously unhinged voice of Imelda Staunton. Any movie in which our hero shoves aside the Elephant Man to grab the spotlight is clearly not typical kids fare though viewers of any age will appreciate the wonderfully expressive animation and imaginative slapstick (the sequence in Londons Royal Society is almost worthy of the Marx Brothers).

Its hard to imagine a kids movie in which the hero could wax nostalgic about ""running people through"" -- as in with a sword -- and make it sound kind of . . . adorable. But then Pirate Captain (both his name and his title) is played by Hugh Grant. And the animation is by Aardman the British claymation geniuses who brought you the adventures of the man-dog team Wallace and Gromit as well as ""Chicken Run."" This time directors Peter Lord and Jeff Newitt delve into the world of piracy reclaiming it from both scary real-world associations and the eyelinered likes of Johnny Depp. The biggest thrill for this mild-mannered crew isnt plundering or plank-walking but Ham Night. Still Captain aims to win the annual ""Pirate of the Year"" competition despite odds favoring the Jeremy Piven-voiced Black Bellamy or sultry Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek). ""Youre probably wondering"" she says ""if Im as deadly as I am beautiful."" Its one of many send-ups asides and downright weird and hilarious bits punctuating this painstakingly animated romp through the high seas and the court of Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton) -- who really really hates pirates. The most inspired character may be slump-shouldered Charles Darwin (David Tennant) first seen aboard the HMS Beagle surrounded by exotic animals and mumbling ""Ill never get a girlfriend."" Darwins face lights up when he catches a glimpse of Polly Pirate Captains oddly plump ""parrot"" who turns out to be a near-extinct dodo. Soon the chase is on as Darwin and his ""manpanzee"" assistant a chimp who communicates via cue cards scheme to abduct Polly and enter her in the royal science fair where the queen seems oddly excited about adding the dodo to her petting zoo. One might wonder whether jokes about lepers and beheadings border on the too-dark for a younger audience. That may be although the same could be said about the collective works of Chuck Jones -- and the joyfully silly gags in ""Pirates"" often feel old-fashioned in a ""Looney Tunes""-esque way (which may also explain why Aardman will reportedly be doing some animation for Warner Bros. in the future). With its hip soundtrack -- the Clashs ""London Calling"" Flight of the Conchords -- ""Pirates"" seems aimed more at parents than kids. (Adults are also the only ones likely to get Grants ""About a Squid"" joke.) But I dont think theres any age that doesnt appreciate a fish dressed up in a pirate hat or the chaos that ensues when a deluge of vinegar meets a stockpile of baking soda. ""You cant always say arrr at the end of a sentence and assume that makes everything all right"" Pirate With a Scarf (Martin Freeman) says. Maybe but these salty lads make you want to give it a try.

Starring Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje Hugh Grant Brendan Gleeson Jeremy Piven Brian Blessed Salma Hayek David Tennant Ashley Jensen Martin Freeman Imelda Staunton Director Peter Lord Running time 128 Release Opened Apr 27 2012  Editorial Review Ahoy Another fun clay creationBy Michael OSullivanFriday Apr. 27 2012Dont let the title fool you. ""The Pirates Band of Misfits"" is not set on the high seas and its central characters are pirates in name only. That last part in this case is literally true. The charmingly goofy animated feature - a welcome return by Aardman Animations to its signature clay-animation style - features characters known only as the Pirate Captain the Pirate with Gout the Albino Pirate etc. Aside from wearing tricorn hats and other accoutrements of the buccaneer lifestyle this motley crew might as well be any old 19th-century street gang with a galleon. The day-to-day business of pirating - plundering running people through - theyre not so good at. This is why their chances of winning the Pirate of the Year award do not look great. Adapted by writer Gideon Defoe from his series of childrens books ""The Pirates"" is built around the premise of a reality-TV-style contest between the Pirate Captain (voiced by Hugh Grant) and three other blackguards Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) and Peg Leg Hastings (Lenny Henry). But after that somewhat sluggish setup the movie quickly - and giddily - sets sail for even wackier waters. In his search for ships filled with booty the Pirate Captain accidentally sacks the HMS Beagle the famous research ship of naturalist Charles Darwin (David Tennant) leading to a more landlocked and delightfully ludicrous adventure. When Darwin learns that the Pirate Captains pet parrot Polly is actually the last surviving dodo - the presumedly extinct flightless bird of legend - Darwin connives to bring the animal along with the pirate crew to London in order to impress his would-be girlfriend Queen Victoria a.k.a. Vicki (Imelda Staunton). This sets in motion a crazed adventure that mashes up Victorian science with modern-day eco-activism and other assorted nonsense. Joseph Merrick as the Elephant Man for instance makes a brief cameo appearance as does writer Jane Austen. Bizarrely enough they seem to be a romantic couple. Like many Aardman films ""The Pirates"" is awash with silliness. There are far more fleeting visual jokes than one can possibly digest in a single viewing. It makes for an experience that while geared toward younger more fidgety audiences has enough humor to keep Mom and Dad from falling asleep. Sophisticated however it is not. As with Aardmans ""Wallace and Gromit"" films theres a sardonic animal sidekick. No not Polly. Its Bobo the chimp manservant of Darwin who like Gromit the dog offers unspoken running commentary on the action of the film with a series of printed cards that allow him to give voice to his innermost thoughts. Sadly hes no Gromit who was able to speak volumes with little more than a raised canine eyebrow. Perhaps by the second ""Pirates"" film there will be a character as beloved as Gromit. (Yes theres already talk of a sequel.) In the meantime ""The Pirates"" has made a buoyant maiden voyage. Contains mild cartoon action and some rude humor.

Who can resist a rollicking blend of British history and contemporary culture by Wallace amp; Gromit creators Aardman Animations? Especially one that works in appearances by Jane Austen and the Elephant Man and plays the Clashs London Calling as the Victorian-era pirates set sail for London?The actors who lend their voices to the characters could not be more spot-on.

Bobo communicates via single words on flashcards. When Darwin hatches a secret plot to take Polly he confides in the monkey then urges him to be quiet. The monkey obliges by holding up a card with a word written on it in tiny typeface.The low-key lunacy and droll wit that infuse the film are a refreshing change from animated films that rely mostly on bathroom humor. Its hard not to be charmed by the absurd antics of the bumbling buccaneers. Appropriate for all ages this delightfully daffy romp has action adventure for younger audiences as well as enough quintessentially British wit to keep adults smiling.

He and his crew have fallen into a long depression; the ships they commandeer turn out to be carrying ghosts nudists or the plague. So when he lands in London in 1837 in the unlikely company of the young Charles Darwin (David Tennant) and seems trapped by his most formidable foe the Captain has only one resource left foolish hope. He hatches a scheme consoling Darwin by saying ""Its only impossible if you stop to think about it."" Stop-motion animation the format employed to make The Pirates Band of Misfits sounds impossible even if you dont stop to think about it. Artisans devise characters and props made of clay or plastic shoot one frame of film then adjust the models 24 times for every second of screen time. The craft also known as Claymation requires a saintly or masochistic devotion. The wonder is that stop-motion directors not only create plausible motion; they bring their figurines and dollhouse accoutrements to vibrant life. Will Vinton used the technique for his California Raisins commercials in 1986 (""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"") and Tim Burton for The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Corpse Bride. (SEE The all-TIME Top 25 Animated Features) The stop-motion masters are the elves at Aardman Studios in Bristol England. Their resident genius Nick Park earned Oscars for his short comedies Creature Comforts The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave -- the last two featuring the addled bachelor inventor Wallace and his dog Gromit a much superior being. Park moved to feature films with Chicken Run in 2000 and the 2005 Wallace amp; Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit which contains 24000 storyboards and 222400 shots; the numbers alone are daunting never mind (no mind very carefully) the writer-directors deliciously dour view of the English in the twilight of Empire as fretful souls who stumble into heroism by failing upward. Park is one of the sublime comic artists of the last few decades and no one should make a stop-motion film without him. (MORE Read TIMEs review of The Curse of the Were-Rabbit) Aardman did though. With Park reportedly toiling on some secret project The Pirates was directed by Peter Lord his longtime colleague and co-director of Chicken Run and Jeff Newitt. Their collaboration has produced a sweet and often engaging picture; audiences are less likely to bust a gut laughing than to find themselves smiling out loud. The Pirate Captain could be an ancestor of Parks Wallace a dreamer with grand notions a blustering optimism and a deficient skills set. The movie -- known in Britain as The Pirates in An Adventure With Scientists after the Gideon Defoe novel that the author turned into a screenplay -- is a cheerful entertainment suitable for kids and parents of the brighter stripe. Its just not Nick Park great. (READ TIMEs review of Chicken Run) With his rather more resourceful second-in-command The Pirate with a Scarf (Martin Freeman) who plays Gromit to his Wallace the Captain has yearned to win the Pirate of the Year award that usually goes to one of his craftier rivals Peg Leg Hastings (Lenny Henry) Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) or Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven). His only consolation is the loyalty of his crew and his faithful parrot Polly. From Darwin the Captain learns that plump Polly is not just a ""big-boned"" relative of the parrots in Rio but the last surviving dodo. Off to London to capture a worthier prize Scientist of the Year the Captain and Darwin run afoul of Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton) who has declared a war on pirates and craves to add Polly to her exotic menagerie. Returning to stop-motion after a troubled collaboration with DreamWorks on the 2006 CGI feature Flushed Away the Aardmanians venture into 3-D animation more vivaciously imparting scenes at sea and in Victorian London with a dizzyingly ornate sense of detail. (CGI is used sparingly here as in the creation of semi-realistic ocean waves; you cant make churning water stop in Claymation.) The curious eye will be occupied by cunning throwaway gags a trio of rats perform clog dancing; the Captain holed up in Darwins London digs outfits the bedroom four-poster with a hammock; a sign on a city wall reads ""Live Sports Urchin Throwing Cockney Basting."" A glimpse of the Queens own flagship reveals that it is called the QV1. (MORE Read TIMEs review of Flushed Away) The real Victoria was 18 in 1837 but is portrayed here as a dowager of dark intent. Filching characters from the breadth of her century The Pirates allows cameo appearances by Jane Austen (who died in 1817) and John Merrick the Elephant Man (not born until 1862). The movie also reduces Darwin from the brilliant father of evolution to a sad inept virgin. Playing fast and loose with historical and chronological facts is a lesser sin than forcing the Pirate Captain out of his amiable and at heart innocent character which occurs when he abandons the dodo for a roomful of treasure. Set pieces like a chase down stairs and streets in a bathtub are briskly realized but seem cliched in comparison with action scenes in Parks short films -- the never-to-be topped model-train climax in The Wrong Trousers for glorious example. (MORE Read about Wallace amp; Gromits Internet shorts) Were not saying that a Park-less film makes his studio an Aardman out. In 2002-04 Richard Goleszowski directed an excellent TV spinoff of Creature Comforts including a Christmas special (in which British citizens portrayed as animals attempt to sing ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"") that offers 22 minutes of sustained comic insight. The Pirates for all its vagrant appeal isnt in that exalted category; it lacks urgency and coherence. The movie is like a pirate without a parrot Darwin without Natural Selection Wallace without Gromit.

Aardman Animations/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Aardman Animations/Sony Pictures The Pirates Band of Misfits Director Peter Lord Jeff Newitt Genre Animation Comedy Adventure Running Time 88 minutes Rated PG for mild action rude humor and some language With Hugh Grant David Tennant Martin Freeman Imelda Staunton In 1837 a young ambitious Charles Darwin was writing in his journal aboard the HMS Beagle when the vessel was waylaid by pirates. But what caught his attention was the feathery mascot accompanying the posse of pillagers a dodo bird thought at the time to be extinct for more than 150 years. In this rare specimen Darwin envisioned the pathway to scientific fame for himself -- and the pirate captain saw the opportunity for vast riches. OK so none of that actually happened. But thats the loopy premise of The Pirates Band of Misfits the latest stop-motion animation feature from Aardman Animations the British studio best known for Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run. Watch Clips From Pirates Band Of Misfits - Briny Rogues Briny Rogues Credit Sony Pictures From Pirates Band Of Misfits - The Competition The Competition Credit Sony Pictures From Pirates Band Of Misfits - Turn Back Turn Back Credit Sony Pictures Based on a series of tongue-in-cheek novels from Gideon Defoe which feature a particularly inept band of buccaneers having adventures with caricatured historical and literary figures Pirates is just what audiences have come to expect from Aardman smart adventure-driven comedy with all-ages appeal and an affinity for clever sight gags. The first scene involving the pirates themselves is a succinct introduction to what kind of humor is in store A heated argument is going on below deck about just what the best thing about being a pirate is. Is it the looting or the cutlasses? Or maybe the exotic diseases? The squabble is interrupted by the Pirate Captain -- Hugh Grant voicing a character whose name literally is ""Pirate Captain"" -- who suggests theyre all wrong and launches into a musical tribute to both piracy and the fact that its ""Ham Night"" aboard the ship. In short these pirates are more in love with the idea of being pirates than they are any good at piracy and the humor here is absurd and self-aware in the best tradition of British comedy. The reason the pirates run across Darwin (David Tennant) is Pirate Captains drive to win an annual Pirate of the Year award. The competition would be formidable even for a talented pirate but as noted Captain is better at maintaining his luxuriant beard than at collecting booty. His hapless attempts to make a last-minute push for loot find him targeting vessels like Darwins -- those without much in the way of bullion onboard. Once Darwin spies ""Polly"" the Dodo though -- Pirate Captain thinks shes just a very large parrot -- he strikes a deal for his life to help Captain collect untold riches by exploiting the discovery of the supposedly extinct species. The only catch? It means docking in a London where the climate toward pirates is decidedly hostile thanks to a crusade to scour the seas of them led by none other than Her Majesty Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton). i Charles Darwin and Pirate Captain strike a risky but potentially lucrative deal when Darwin points out that Captains parrot Polly is in fact a supposedly extinct dodo. Aardman Animations/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Aardman Animations/Sony Pictures Charles Darwin and Pirate Captain strike a risky but potentially lucrative deal when Darwin points out that Captains parrot Polly is in fact a supposedly extinct dodo. Aardman Animations/Sony Pictures All of which may sound almost historically educational but isnt any more so than say Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure. The historical figures here bear only passing similarities to their real-life analogs The movies Darwin is repellently ambitious and as obsessed with his lack of luck with the ladies as he is with the origin of the species while this Victoria has all the royal composure of a drill sergeant. Co-director and Aardman founder Peter Lord sticks close to the signature style that has defined the studio for years. The characters are the familiar rounded figurines featuring bulbous eyes and wide toothy grins. Each frame is packed with detail with just as many jokes occurring in the background as upfront a quality that has always rewarded repeated viewings of their work. And fans of the popular Aardman device of speechless animals that are often more insightful than their human counterparts will particularly enjoy Mr. Bobo a highly trained chimp (or ""manpanzee"") whom Darwin employs as his assistant (much as Wallace treats Gromit in Nick Parks acclaimed films) and who communicates entirely with one-word flash cards. While there are a few pockets of humor that target the adults in the audience a little too specifically -- a slightly too-predictable Oscar parody at the Pirate of the Year awards for instance -- for the most part Pirates succeeds at maintaining equal appeal for both young and old. Barely a moment goes by without a well-orchestrated joke (or three) and its paced as briskly as a clipper in front of a stiff tailwind.

The folks at British animation outfit Aardman makers of ""Wallace amp; Gromit"" have a knack for leaving us smiling almost as goofily as one of their bulbous claymation creations. They do it yet again with ""The Pirates Band of Misfits"" a genial genre sendup that marks the studios return to traditional stop-motion animation this time in 3-D. (Aardman relied on computers for ""Arthur Christmas"" and 2006s ""Flushed Away."") The movie could also teach something to the makers of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" about delivering a story quirky enough to actually stick with you. Love Jack Sparrow but our recollection of his exploits has always been as hazy as his probably.Directed by Aardman co-founder Peter Lord (""Chicken Run"") the movie features Hugh Grant breaking out of stammering charmer mode as Pirate Captain a Victorian-era swashbuckler in love with his work. Hes got a swell-if-sketchy crew his beard is luxuriant and he regularly dines on ham (every bit the delicacy to him that cheese is to Wallace). Unfortunately he never wins the hallowed Pirate of the Year competition getting shown up time and again by hotshots Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) and Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek).Following yet another humiliation the dejected crew runs into Galapagos-hopping Charles Darwin (David Tennant ""Doctor Who"") who informs Pirate Captain that his ""parrot"" is actually a dodo bird and their ticket to glory. Maybe even yes Pirate of the Year honors. Itll just involve a quick jaunt to London -- seat of scary Victoria (Imelda Staunton) who is decidedly not amused by piracy. And then things get really wacky.The movie looks meticulously crafted of course and is consistently drily amusing. Among the throwaways Grants embarrassed mumbling about a Vegas-y night in Madagascar and piratical exclamations of ""Oh sweet Neptunes briny pants"" Theres so much going on often so subtly you may want to sail with this crew more than once. Were still trying to figure out where we missed Al Rokers voice work as the ""Pirate Who Likes Sunsets and Kittens.""Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com.

"Movie review The Pirates Band of Misfits plunder and please - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review The Pirates Band of Misfits plunder and pleaseAardman Animations stop-motion film offers an absurd Monty Python-type premise and delivers a clever delightful story. Its quite a booty.April 27 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic The Pirate Captain (voiced by Hugh Grant) with Polly in ""The Pirates... (Aardman Animations / Sony...)Its not often noted in the history books but Queen Victoria simply couldnt stand pirates. In fact the words ""I Hate Pirates"" are prominently carved on the royal crest. You could look it up.Well actually you cant because the wacky folks at Aardman Animations made it up as a key plot point of their delightful""The Pirates Band of Misfits""a clever piece of business that is a complete pleasure to experience.Based on a novel by Gideon Defoe who also wrote the screenplay ""Pirates"" follows the exploits such as they are of Pirate Captain (wonderfully voiced by Hugh Grant) perhaps not the sharpest cutlass in the Caribbean but a cheerful sort much beloved by his men. When he says ""its only impossible if you stop to think about it"" the captain is as good as his word.As directed by Peter Lord (who co-directed the gleeful ""Chicken Run"") ""Pirates"" creates a sense of fun that feels hand-made rather than machine manufactured. This comes not only from its absurd Monty Python-esque scenario but also from the physical nature of the stop-motion animation process Aardman specializes in.Though CGI is used around the edges most of this film is made as ""King Kong"" and Aardmans own Oscar-winning ""Wallace and Gromit"" films were before it in a time-honored method where physical objects are manipulated literally frame by frame to give the illusion of movement.Stop-motion is so labor intensive it took the filmmakers a full 18 months to film a key scene in a piratical pub. The gangs trusty ship is so tangible it weighs 770 pounds and the Aardman team used 220000 tiny props and 250 puppets to bring the world of circa 1837 buccaneers to life.All this real-world physicality offers a welcome counterweight to a story that is silliness itself but silliness conveyed with such energy and panache that finding the Elephant Man and Rubiks Cube not to mention the legendary queen herself in the same scenario seems only natural.When we first meet the pirates theyre engaged in a spirited discussion of whats best about being a buccaneer. Some say its the looting others say its the cutlasses but the captain who is fond of his creature comforts (not to mention his luxuriant beard) votes for Ham Night.Loyally supported by his No. 2 (Martin Freeman) who understands that saving the chief from himself is a full-time job the captain has only one lack in his life Hes never won the coveted Pirate of the Year honor though not for lack of trying.Nothing daunted Pirate Captain heads to Blood Island to fill out the required entry form trying to forget that the only thing hes ever won is a ribbon for Best Anecdote About a Squid.The captains self-confidence takes a body blow however when he meets his main rivals including Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) definitely as deadly as she is beautiful and perennial winner Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) who makes a whale-assisted entrance that is the last word in impressiveness.Understandably disheartened about his contest prospects Pirate Captain throws himself into his work with renewed vigor but hits a streak of bad luck that gets worse when he captures a young scientist named Charles Darwin (David Tennant). Yes that Charles Darwin.About to be made to walk the plank Darwin suddenly notices something peculiar about the captains beloved parrot Polly. With his own nefarious aims in mind Darwin or Chuck as the captain takes to calling him convinces the credulous pirate that taking this strange bird to London a and risking the wrath of the pirate-phobic queen thrillingly voiced by Imelda Staunton a will make him a wealthy man. As if.The twists and turns of the ""Pirates"" plot are many but hanging on for the duration is a pleasure. The visual treats are many including random signage (""Live Sports Urchin Throwing Cockney Baiting"" reads one) and a clever riff on movie maps that illustrate nautical progress.The film even has an especially eclectic soundtrack that finds room for the Clashs ""London Calling"" Desmond Dekkers singing ""You Can Get It if You Really Want"" and Strauss ""Also Sprach Zarathustra."" And the 3-D the film is shot in actually enhances the experience. If were living in a golden age of animation a and we are a the folks at Aardman are a key reason why.kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNew Releases Silly fun in Aardmans The Pirates Band of...August 25 2012The Pirates Band of Misfits helps stop-motion endureApril 26 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentAardman AnimationsCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-pirates-20120427,0,7597704.story?track=rss",200,thepiratesbandofmisfits14,thepiratesbandofmisfits,latimes

That the main challenge of Charles Darwins scientific career was how to attract a girl? That Her Serene Highness Queen Victoria was in fact a ninja? For top-notch historical research and lowbrow high jinks on the high seas theres no topping ""The Pirates Band of Misfits."" This splashy sendup is a dead mans chest of laughs. Presented in a seamless blend of Claymation computer graphics classical cartooning and 3-D its the most technically ambitious effort yet from Englands Aardman Animation creators of the classic Wallace amp; Gromit series. Its not Aardmans best by a long shot but the tales seafaring shenanigans are leagues above most animated ho-hummery. The film is loosely based on Gideon Defoes book series about comically inept scalawags with Hugh Grant giving voice to the Pirate Captain a hairy walking neurosis. The epitome of British underdog humor he leads his men on raids against gold-stuffed galleons that turn out to be plague ships or school outings. He hopes to win the Pirate of the Year Award but since the bounty on his head is a measly 12 doubloons prospects are dim. When they raid Darwins Beagle and learn that their pet parrot is in fact a priceless dodo the path to the prize detours the crew to London and into the presence of the fire-breathing monarch herself. Imelda Staunton is suitably ferocious as the quarrelsome queen. Like Defoes books the film is stuffed with absurd anachronisms broad comedy and sly asides aimed at older audiences. Quite a lot of plot rejiggering was required as the film jettisoned much of Defoes book. The original subtitle was ""An Adventure With Scientists"" and the antagonist was Darwins archenemy the ""evil"" ""nefarious"" ""black-hearted"" Bishop of Oxford. Anticlerical satire is sheer heresy for the American multiplex and like Philip Pullmans dark fantasy ""The Golden Compass"" before it this film has been gutted and jerry-built to avoid a culture-war tizzy. If I had a plank handy Id make the yellow-belly behind that decision walk it. Even with a major character and the foundation of its (admittedly flimsy) plot missing ""Pirates"" lives pretty well from gag to gag nearly achieving its Monty Python meets ""Treasure Island"" potential. There are genius moments here. The pirate ship features coin-op cannons a surprisingly curvaceous mate with a hilariously transparent fake beard never arouses suspicion and Joseph Merrick pops in for a brief Elephant Man cameo. There are flat stretches as well (Salma Hayek and Jeremy Piven underwhelm as villainous rival Pirate of the Year contestants). Still I emitted more ""Harrrs"" than ""Arrghs."" ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Aardman Animations for Sony PIctures Animation/Aardman Animations for Sony PIct) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday April 26 2012 213 PM Title The Pirates Band of Misfits Film Info With Hugh Grant Salma Hayek. Animated comedy about a gentleman pirate. Directors Peter Lord Jeff Newitt (128).PG Mild violence crude humor. At area theaters. The two little girls who joined me at a recent screening of ""The Pirates Band of Misfits"" made this heartfelt request as soon as it ended ""Please please please give this movie five stars"" Alas I cannot. But I can say that most 5 and 7-year-olds are likely to have the same response they did. (""I didnt understand it all but it was really fun."") Screenwriter Gideon Defoe has adapted his own comic novels with help from the fine folks at Aardman Animation (including directors Peter Lord and Jeff Newitt). The result is indeed a rollicking good time even if Aardmans ambitions dont quite dazzle as usual. As the title indicates Defoes buccaneers are more sensitive than swashbuckling especially the courtly Pirate Captain (voiced by Hugh Grant). The captain desperately wants to win the Pirate of the Year award but he simply cant compete with the evil likes of Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) and Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek). He and his men (including Martin Freeman Anton Yelchin and Brendan Gleeson) need a new angle a way to pillage without being impolite. They find it courtesy of young scientist Charles Darwin (David Tennant) who notes that the captains parrot is actually a dodo. With Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton) offering an enormous bounty for nearly extinct animals this could be their ticket. Pirate Captain (voiced by Hugh Grant center with his bird Polly) leads a Band of Misfits that includes (l.-r.) Pirate with Gout (voiced by Brendan Gleeson) Albino Pirate (voiced by Russell Tovey) Pirate with Scarf (voiced by Martin Freeman) and Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate (voiced by Ashley Jensen). (AARDMAN ANIMATIONS/SONY PICTURES/PR NEWSWIRE) Perhaps its appropriate that a movie about pirates plunders its big twist from another film (to say which one would give away the surprise). But that easy choice does represent the slight air of underachievement that hangs over the entire movie. The claymation visuals are charming and an enthusiastic if somewhat underused cast works hard to sell the better jokes (though the funniest gag is a silent monkey butler).

"Review The Pirates Band of Misfits - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies With The Pirates Band of Misfits the treasures in the details Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips picks 10 movies you should look forward to this summer. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Maniacally inventive and tightly packed if not overpacked ""The Pirates Band of Misfits"" comes from the Aardman animation folks behind Wallace amp; Gromit ""Chicken Run"" and more recently ""Arthur Christmas."" Their latest may be easier to admire than to love; its more tone-funny and incidental-muttered-aside funny than for example your average DreamWorks smash where every other comic beat ends with a cartoon animal getting bashed in the nethers and then quoting some inappropriate gangster movie.But a few hours after seeing the 3-D version of ""The Pirates"" I was smiling at the memory of the best bits some so fleeting they practically dare an audience to catch them on the fly. Director Peter Lord works in an interesting mixture of stop-motion and digital animation. Also I like the notion of high seas scalawags who are essentially lousy at their jobs and who may plunder and occasionally kill but are sociable and easygoing and take their cue from the good-time bloke running the show the Pirate Captain voiced by Hugh Grant.The Pirate Captain boasts an oft-admired ""luxuriant"" red beard and a unique shipboard mascot a ""big-boned"" parrot named Polly who is actually a dodo. The plot adapted by screenwriter Gideon Defoe from his 2004 jape ""The Pirates In an Adventure with Scientists"" is a silly thing involving the Captains quest to become Pirate of the Year. Spying the dodo naturalist Charles Darwin (""Chuck"" to the Captain; the Captain also calls the diabolical villainess Queen Victoria ""Vicky"") plots a kidnapping so he can present his finding to his peers and win his own share of glory.On the page Defoes story is wonderfully dry and consistently droll. The movie has those same qualities though the scale of the action feels a bit frantic. Some of the high-velocity set pieces are tiring and tend to sit on the fun. (The soundtrack at the screening I attended was set at ""Xelerator hand dryer"" levels.) The visual detail in ""The Pirates"" is really something yet I wonder if all the bustle tends to encourage younger viewers to tune out rather than lean in.That said the Aardman people can always be counted on for such felicities as Darwins simian factotum the silent Mr. Bobo. The monkey communicates by way of flashcards. Alarmed by the latest turn in the plot he flashes a card saying ""BUT ..."" and then exhorted to shush by his employer he quickly flashes a second card reading ""but ..."" At the scientific discovery competition the settings on the applause-o-meter include ""rather fusty"" and on the high end ""ladies fainting."" Uneven but rollicking ""The Pirates"" has a personality to call its own. The paperback edition of Defoes book delightfully is appended by a faux-list of other titles in the ""Pirates"" series. Among them ""The Pirates In an Adventure with Your Mother""; ""The Pirates In an Adventure with Risk Management""; and ""The Pirates Rainy Day Indoors.""mjphillipstribune.comPirates Band of Misfits -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG (for mild action rude humor and some language)Running time 127Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Piracy Movies Entertainment DreamWorks Animation Charles Darwin Peter Lord 10 best baseball movies Five-Year Engagement Engaging rom-com worth an I do  1/2 Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline cant save messy Darling Companion  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising77deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0424-pirates-band-of-misfits-20120426,0,3151287.column",200,thepiratesbandofmisfits18,thepiratesbandofmisfits,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Jan Svankmajers stop-motion looks angry rough and primal; Henry Selicks is so polished and smooth that it resembles CGI. But Aardman Animations stop-motion releases like the Wallace amp; Gromit shorts Chicken Run and Shaun The Sheep are instantly recognizable for the almost exaggerated sense that every aspect of the production has been formed by hand with the caricatured distortions of childrens drawings mixed with the fussy craft of a crocheted doily. That fussiness also extends to the studios house brand of humor a precisely tuned blend of maiden-aunt primness and broad goofy absurdism. All these familiar flavors are again front and center in The Pirates Band Of Misfits the feature that returns Aardman to theatrical stop-motion after the CGI of Arthur Christmas and Flushed Away. It also returns Aardman co-founder Peter Lord to the directors chair for the first time since 2000s Chicken Run. But it doesnt feel like a return to form--or a new direction though its Aardmans first book-to-film adaptation Hugh Grants first animated film and the studios maiden foray into 3-D stop-motion. It still feels like a comfortable visit with an old friend. Gideon Defoe scripted from his own series-launching comedic book The Pirates In An Adventure With Scientists about the adventures of a hapless group of pirates known only by names like The Pirate With The Scarf The Pirate With Gout and in the case of their leader The Pirate Captain. The openly ridiculous plot has The Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) scheming to win the Pirate Of The Year competition even though hes a terrible pirate far outclassed by rivals voiced by Jeremy Piven and Salma Hayek. When a typical gaffe has him invading the Beagle and trying to rob Charles Darwin (David Tennant) he learns that his beloved ""parrot"" Polly is actually a dodo bird. Hungry for fame and the approval of rare-animal collector Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton) Darwin deceives the Captain and his crew into believing they can get enough booty to win the pirate competition by entering Polly in a science fair. So the pirates journey to London in cheerful blinkered defiance of the Queen a hotheaded schemer whose royal crest reads simply ""I hate pirates."" What follows is a bunch of nonstop goofery involving chase sequences dream sequences fast-changing costumes and an improbable beard a little musical help from Flight Of The Conchords and ultimately a very physical confrontation with a surprisingly spry Victoria. None of it amounts to much particularly given that its all in the service of a man wanting to win a meaningless contest he doesnt deserve to win and the question of whether his noodlehead crew and his surprisingly competent second in command (Martin Freeman) will still respect him throughout. The stakes are low and the story beats are incidental amid the rush of largely mild visual gags and verbal sallies like ""Blood Island So called because its the exact shape of some blood"" But Pirates comes with all the usual Aardman strengths intact particularly the sense that its characters and creators alike are too good-hearted and sweet to nitpick. The ambition is all in the craft rather than in the storytelling but its hard to say no to the proficiency of that craft or the mild good cheer behind it.

The Pirates Band of Misfits Good Directors Peter Lord Jeff Newitt. Cast Hugh Grant Salma Hayek Jeremy Piven. Rating PG for mild action rude humor and language. And really is there any other word than ""lunacy"" to cover ham night for pirates a Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate and Charles Darwin as a bad guy sort of? (Simmer down creation theorists -- hes more selfish than evil. Queen Victoria is the evil one.) The film directed by Peter Lord and Jeff Newitt comes from Aardman Animations the folks behind the ""Wallace amp; Gromit"" films among many others and is a hoot. I wouldnt use it as a study guide for Victorian history though it would be fun to see the reaction on the teachers face when the test was graded. Interview Director Peter Lord The Pirate Captain (voice of Hugh Grant) is beloved by his crew which includes the Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate (Ashley Jensen) the Pirate with a Scarf (Martin Freeman) and the Pirate with Gout (Brendan Gleeson). A motley bunch for certain. And truth be told the Captain is not much of a pirate -- at least not when it comes to important pirate stuff like raiding other ships and stealing booty things like that. That sort of thing is done better and more often by the likes of Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) and Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven). This doesnt prevent the Captain from entering the Pirate of the Year contest however even though his chances at winning are non-existent. The Captain just doesnt have much luck when it comes to stealing as a funny series of ship raids shows. Then one day he raids the H.M.S. Beagle where he encounters Charles Darwin himself (with voice provided by David Tennant). Darwins not having much more luck than the Pirate Captain with his own career -- until he realizes that Polly the Captains beloved bird which everyone thought was just a fat parrot is in fact the last dodo in existence. Darwin wants to take the bird to London so he can win the science academys award. But the Captain wants in on the action as well so he decides that he along with his crew will accompany Darwin to London. The only hitch Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton) hates pirates and will doubtless do away with the Captain and his gang if she catches them. Ridiculous rollicking adventures follow including a chase scene involving a bathtub that rivals the train chase in ""The Wrong Trousers."" In the hilarious-but-mute smarter-than-he-looks animal role that Gromit fills so well in his films is Mr. Bobo a sort of simian gentlemans gentleman for Darwin who describes him like this ""I thought if you took a monkey gave him a monocle and covered up his gigantic unsightly arse then he would cease to be a monkey and become more of a Manpanzee if you will."" If you laughed at that you likely will love ""Pirates"" If not well it might be a tougher slog. The humor is dry; ""witty"" might better describe it. Very British you might say. Surprisingly this is Grants first time voicing an animated character; hes really good as the Captain nailing both his infectious enthusiasm for his work and his base ineptitude. The combination leaves you with a character worth rooting for no matter how many times he fails. (Answer many.) ""Pirates"" is not quite on a par with such Aardman features as ""The Wrong Trousers"" or ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" Wallace and Gromits classic adventures or ""Chicken Run."" But it has its share of delights for kids and grown-ups alike. Its funny its smart (look for Jane Austen and the Elephant Man in a pub) and its sure enough of itself that it didnt have to over-rely on the word ""arghhh"" to get its pirate point across.

You can almost smell the brine in the boat helmed by Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) on his quest to win Pirate of the Year. The regal glares of his archenemy Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton) are tangibly cruel. So even when the whimsy in The Pirates Band of Misfitss history-be-damned story (which also ropes in Charles Darwin) feels a bit forced the magic of the medium never does.

So what could the U.K.s Aardman Animation bring to our oversaturated kids entertainment market you ask? A keenly calibrated sense of Pythonesque silliness actually; and anyone still doubting that the Claymation studio behind Wallace and Gromit deserves a seat at the grown-ups table only needs to see its pitch-perfect collaboration with author-screenwriter Gideon Defoe in this adaptation of two of his goofy demented swashbuckling tales. A pirate captain named appropriately the Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) cant plunder to save his parrots life. But his sheer incompetence doesnt stop him from having a loyal crew--credit his ships morale-boasting ""Ham Nights""--or from trying to win the Pirate of the Year award. Some chance encounters with Charles Darwin (Doctor Whos David Tennant) and the seafarer-hating Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton) however distract the good Captain from attaining his goal. Characters with names like the Pirate with Gout give you a sense of the Goon Show-level of humor here; even the requisite animal sidekick Darwins sophisticated ""manpanzee"" Mister Bobo is more droll than cute. A single nod to hip-hop culture feels like pandering and youll wish that Salma Hayek and Jeremy Pivens villainous competitors for the prize were more than just extended celebrity-voice cameos. But no one else has come close to translating Englands homegrown blend of deadpan and madcap for a younger audience much less with such impressive Claymated technique.

A newly crowned Queen Victoria voiced by Imelda Staunton and animated in clay as a shrewish little turnip of a woman decrees war on buccaneering. Well down her Most Wanted list is the Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) an only middling terror of the trade routes whos a perennial also-ran for Pirate of the Year. On the way to the Queen and Captains crossing swords The Pirates hits the usual kids pic stops--pop montage theme-park-ride action heartwarming affirmation of true friendship--but a script that consistently finds fresh outlets for its running gags makes for a sufficiently rollicking pleasure cruise from Britains Aardman Animations with their first stop-motion feature since 2005s Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Screenwriter Gideon Defoe adapts from his own series of comedy books for young people and the humor ranges from obliviously brutal slapstick--anchor is never dropped without a casualty--to 19th-century name-dropping with a cast that includes Charles Darwin (an anxious virgin whose Beagle voyage is strictly to score chicks) Jane Austen and the Elephant Man. The take-home lesson is a kind of outcast morality--better to be an honest pirate than a dishonest queen.

"Pirates Band of Misfits The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pirates-band-of-misfits-the ) Pirates Band of Misfits The (United Kingdom/United States 2012) April 23 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Any movie emerging from Aardman Animation Studios comes with a set of expectations the majority of which are satisfied The Pirates Band of Misfits an affectionate parody of the pirate genre. Suffused with satire wit and the dry tongue-in-cheek flavor of comedy one rarely finds in American productions this stop-motion animated excursion pokes fun at pirate conventions while representing icons Queen Victoria and Charles Darwin as a bitch and a twit respectively. Its all in good fun of course but it takes a certain degree of brazenness to transform a pair of respected historical figures into villains while making those who terrorize the high seas into loveable rogues. Not even Pirates of the Caribbean went quite that far. Pirating like any other vocation has its luminaries and The Pirate Captain (voice of Hugh Grant) isnt among them. He likes to think of himself as a scourge of the ocean but his crew is comprised of halfwits and his choice of targets leaves something to be desired. Plague ships and ghost ships dont carry a lot of gold. But The Pirate Captain is well-liked by his men if only for a tradition aboard ship called ""Hamnight."" For the 20th consecutive year The Pirate Captain has applied for the Pirate of the Year award but his competition is stiff Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) and Peg Leg Hastings (Lenny Henry). To beat those three The Pirate Captain has to do something spectacular. Thats when he meets Charles Darwin (David Tennant) and his fortunes seem to change although perhaps not in ways that will impress The Pirate King (Brian Blessed). The story is feather-light but has sufficient form to introduce the characters and establish their conflicts. Its more of a comedy than an adventure but there are several action scenes of a familiar structure to those typically found in animated family features. The humor comes in two flavors broad comedy designed to appeal as much to children as to adults and a more sly variety often in the dialogue that is accessible primarily to older viewers. Most successful animated films can boast this quality. The Pirates like previous Aardman productions is not just for kids. The usage of high quality stop-motion techniques gives The Pirates a sufficiently different look and feel from most current animated films that it seems almost revolutionary. While theres nothing new about Aardman employing stop-motion (they are the claymation kings) this is their first 3-D stop-motion outing. (Arthur Christmas was 3-D but it was computer animated not stop-motion.) Perhaps surprisingly it can be said that the 3-D adds more than it detracts. 3-D seems especially well-suited to stop-motion animation and it gives the images real ""pop."" The technique never seems showy or gimmicky in this context and the only noticeable detraction is the diminution of brightness. The Pirates is by no means murky or dim but neither is it dazzling. The movie could almost certainly be seen in 2-D without a loss in overall entertainment value - nothing in The Pirates demands 3-D - but it could be successfully argued that there is extra value for those who chose to pay the surcharge. The casting benefits from the relative anonymity of the voices. Hugh Grant is not an obscure figure and although its possible to recognize his dulcet tones no disconnect is created between the real-life actor and his animated avatar (which indeed looks nothing like Grant). Similar comments can be made about Martin Freeman (as The Pirate Captains second-in-command) David Tennant Imelda Staunton and Jeremy Piven. Even Doctor Who fans are unlikely to be distracted by Tennant who sounds nothing like he did while in the TARDIS. Only Salma Hayek and Brian Blessed are immediately recognizable but neither has more than a handful of lines. The Pirates boasts no stunt casting; the actors were chosen based on their ability to fill their parts and they accomplish what is expected of them. The Pirates which is the first directorial effort from Aardman co-creator Peter Lord since Chicken Run is fun and lightweight offering an enjoyable 90 minutes but not making a run at true animated greatness. Theres ample evidence of creativity but the film falls short of some of the studios best past work as well as 2011s similarly pitched Western parody Rango. Maybe part of the problem is the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean which stumbled so deeply into the realm of self-parody that it narrowed the territory available to a more intentionally comedic production like The Pirates Nevertheless seen from almost any vantage point this is the most enjoyable pirate movie since the first of Gore Verbinskis live-action tales featuring Capn Jack Sparrow.

Well said spark is back with a vengeance in this deliriously entertaining tale of a pirate crew and their efforts to become internationally regarded scientific boffins.Hugh Grant voices The Pirate Captain whose attempts to become Pirate of the Year are constantly thwarted because well hes not very good at his job. But when kidnapped naturalist (and girl-shy nerd) Charles Darwin points out that the Captains beloved parrot Polly is in fact the last living dodo the Captain and his merry crew - who in keeping with screenwriter Gideon Defoes 2004 source novel all have names like The Pirate with Gout and The Pirate with a Scarf - set sail for London to present their find to the Royal Society.Movies like the Shrek series have largely devalued the idea of a film aimed at both children and parents but The Pirates gets the balance spot on. Kids will be enthralled by all the action slapstick and yo-ho-ho-ing while the olds will get a kick out of the intricate visual detail sparkling wit (theres not a single avast behind gag) and wild historical inaccuracies find me another movie in which Jane Austen chucks a beer mug at the Elephant Man. The result is a brilliant mish-mash of styles and genres crammed with ideas and intelligence and carried off with a sense of rebellious fun and breathtaking invention not seen since well The Wrong Trousers.

The humour of Wallace and Gromit and the numerous sight gags and amusing background gags reminiscent of Aardman at their very best help raise this above the average. Look out for the ""Live sport"" posters outside the pubs in particular. After half of the film I was feeling a bit disappointed but the film improves and with a superb sound track and the best supporting perfornance by a supporting character by Mr Bobo the chimp since Feathers McGraw helped. Hugh Grant plays himself on top form as if this was a Richard Curtis comedy. The kids will love it and the adults will find more than enough to keep them happy.

After dipping its toes into pure CG animation for ""Arthur Christmas"" Aardman integrates its feted old-school stop-motion technique with top-drawer visual effects to create the irrepressibly amusing ""The Pirates Band of Misfits."" Although this family-friendly tale of feckless adventurers pursuing a prize is consistently funnier than ""Arthur"" in language humor and attitude its as endearingly British as Yorkshire pudding soccer hooliganism and wonky teeth which may temper its fortunes beyond Blighty. There the Sony release will merrily plunder cash registers but pirate appeal should still help it shiver B.O. timbers elsewhere before an ancillary pillage. Deftly and rather freely adapted by Gideon Defoe from his own humorous not-necessarily-for-kids novel ""The Pirates In an Adventure With Scientists"" (the pics title in the U.K.) the 1837-set story centers around a hero known only as the Pirate Captain (voiced by Hugh Grant growling down an octave). The Captain proudly boasts a luxuriant beard even if his modest haul of doubloons is less impressive. Despite his manifest shortcomings as an extorter of wealth on the high seas his crew remains fiercely loyal to him. Plus they dont mind being known only by descriptive monikers such as the Pirate With a Scarf (Martin Freeman) the Pirate With Gout (Brendan Gleeson) or the Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate (Ashley Jensen) a femme with an obviously fake beard whom no one seems to have pegged as a girl. The Captain sets his sights on winning the coveted Pirate of the Year award even though his rivals -- Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) Peg Leg Hastings (Lenny Henry) and Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) -- have much bigger booty in the original piratical sense of the word. After several ill-fated attempts to build up his treasure chest the Captain and crew happen upon young naturalist Charles Darwin (former ""Doctor Who"" David Tennant) who notices that their ships ""big-boned"" bird-in-residence Polly is not actually a parrot but rather the last dodo on Earth. Darwin persuades them to bring Polly to the Royal Academy to receive a ""priceless"" award. However when virulent pirate-phobe Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton) sees Polly she insists she simply must have her for the Royal Zoo and offers the Captain an immense fortune prompting a crisis of conscience. It turns out that the monarch whos more than just a pretty national figurehead has a much more nefarious plan in mind. Helmer Peter Lord one of Aardmans co-founders and director of some of the outfits darker early work (such as short ""Going Equipped"") has taken producing credits on most of the companys recent output giving him a lower industry profile than colleague Nick Park (with whom he co-directed ""Chicken Run""). But based on the evidence here Lord has a steely grip on what gives the Aardman its brand value an exhaustive attention to detail that crams the intricate sets with peripheral-vision jokes; a very droll quintessentially English sense of humor (Blood Island is so named because its ""the exact shape of some blood""); and ruthlessly efficient comic timing. Slightly saltier in sensibility than Parks cozier ""Wallace and Gromit"" pics the humor mostly skews toward an older age bracket even though younger tots will get a visual rush from the slapstick setpieces. A chase down a staircase in a bathtub and the de rigueur climactic battle between the Captain and a swashbuckling Victoria aboard her fabulously Steampunk-style ship rep bravura displays of stop-motion technique coordinating several figures at once all moving through space. Although most auds wont notice animation geeks will swoon over what Lord and Co. have accomplished technically. As in ""Coraline"" the use of 3D enhances the sculptural technique and lends itself well to dramatic lighting effects but it never distracts and the pic wont suffer a bit in 2D. Though the plasticine figures still have a pleasingly tactile smushy quality theyre modeled with great subtlety; new methods of rendering mouth movements have enhanced verisimilitude and the CG is used strategically to conquer always tricky materials like water and smoke. Matching the cheerfully anachronistic jokes in the script the eclectic soundtrack choices add a contempo vibe with a mix of reggae classics and tunes by Supergrass and Flight of the Conchords.

TWITTER Aardmans latest Claymation romp stars Hugh Grant as the voice of a pirate who causes trouble in Victorian England. NEW YORK -- Aardman Animations distinctively charming brand of Claymation returns to the big screen at last in The Pirates Band of Misfits a delightful romp whose varied pleasures should please kids all along the age spectrum. An easy sell at the box office it is sequel-ready thanks to a series of books by Gideon Defoe. The title doesnt hint at the films plot which incorporates real-life (if drolly reimagined) historical figures Charles Darwin and Queen Victoria but it gets at the heroes lovable-loser appeal Although their leader the generically named Pirate Captain voiced by Hugh Grant) sees himself as a rogue to be reckoned with he and his crew are a flop in the departments of menace and booty-snatching. Theyre better at securing smoked meats for Ham Night than locating victims worth robbing but when a Pirate of the Year event arrives (Salma Hayek and Jeremy Piven entertain as two of the villainous competitors) they start boarding every boat they spy in hopes of impressing the judge. When they attack Darwins Beagle the calmly terrified nerd reveals that they already possess a priceless treasure Polly their beloved parrot is actually a rare dodo. Captains misguided attempt to exploit the bird for gold leads to London where Victorias anti-pirate campaign means the shipmates must don absurd disguises while fending off attempts to birdnap Polly. Although Defoes witty screenplay overflows with gags for viewers who know a bit of history -- ever wanted to see snobby Jane Austen throw a beer stein at poor Joseph Merrick aka the Elephant Man? -- plot points quickly translate to action with chase scenes involving bubble-filled bathtubs and pedal-driven airships. (The filmmakers may be saving elaborate swordplay for later installments though pirate slang is hardly in short supply.) While this tales cast lacks singular characters like the absentminded inventor Wallace and his wise and taciturn dog Gromit it does offer a terrific wordless animal Darwins trained ""manpanzee"" butler who dryly comments on the action via dialogue on index cards. Victorian England is rendered in sets whose scope and detail are enhanced by CG but computer effects are only noticeable where they nicely complement the animators models -- in sea scenes for instance where realistic crashing waves enhance the thrill factor. Other technical touches like lens curvature in shots through a pirates spyglass are more subtle but will delight viewers who appreciate craftsmanship.
