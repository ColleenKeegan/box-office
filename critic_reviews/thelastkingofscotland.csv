"In Last King of Scotland Idi Amins story watered down is with a soapy solution - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW King is watered down with soapy solution By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 4 2006 ""The Last King of Scotland"" is set in the 1970s during President Idi Amins horrific eight-year-rule of Uganda and for many of the movies early scenes the camera has a tough time finding a local face to get lost in.There are plenty of options. But since the movie is a confused cautionary tale about what happens to impressionable foreigners seduced by an exotic locale were furnished instead with numerous shots of our protagonist a young white doctor named Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) whos come from Scotland to do good.His home was a cold and dreary bore. This new place a former British colony that Amin has just overtaken in a military coup is exotic hot and moves fast. (Not long after hes hit African soil Nick beds a woman he meets on a bus.)Pretty soon he makes his way to a big public assembly and we discover that the movies been holding out for that local face. Its Amins. Exhilarated the camera races right up to Forest Whitaker who plays the president and gets close enough for us to count his pores and admire his lopsided eyes. In this electric moment he blasts out a speech that rocks the crowd.Here you understand immediately how Amin came to seduce and destroy a nation leaving as many as half-a-million people murdered. To some extent innocent Nick falls in love at first sight with Amins obvious power and to a more unsettling degree so does the movie which Kevin Macdonald directs from a novel by Giles Foden. ``The Last King"" is turned on by Amins menace but demonstrates only a passing regard for the scope of his malevolence.After Nick happens upon an injured Amin and tends to him on the side of a road the president winds up making Nick his personal physician and later his personal adviser. (If he werent Ugandan Amin says hed be a Scotsman.) In turn the doctor finds himself drawn into one trashy development after the next accepting Amins complimentary Mercedes convertible and spouting rhetoric he knows nothing about ``This is Africa. You meet violence with violence. Anything less and youre dead""The lives of the doctor and the dictator become entangled. Nick spies an Amin associate at a nightclub and reports back that the man must have been up to no good. Later Nick begins sleeping with Kay (Kerry Washington) the youngest and comeliest of Amins wives. The affair and its gruesome fallout drive the back half of the picture which all-too-happily becomes a laughable potboiler.This focus on a soap-opera romance illuminates the movies biggest flaw. While Kay and Nick are sneaking behind Amins back Amin is slaughtering thousands behind ours. The movie provides the barest inkling of the atrocities (rapid montages here and there) without directly laying crimes at the regimes feet. The only person captured truly suffering is poor fictional Nick. In this sense ``The Last King of Scotland"" joins the ranks of nightmarish innocents-abroad movies from ``Midnight Express"" to ``Hostel"" where the disillusioned hero fights to return to civility.This being an African version the filmmakers deploy all the savage trimmings including Nicks trip to a bleating haunted house of a hospital which gallingly enough is paired with erotic moaning on the soundtrack. The only person in the movie with any sense is a blond Gillian Anderson as a doctors British wife last glimpsed on a bus full of locals getting out of Dodge. Lucky them.In ``One Day in September"" a documentary about the hostage-taking at the 1972 Munich Olympics and the rock-climbing thriller ``Touching the Void"" Macdonald turned true stories into compelling docudrama. Here he lacks the steady moral hand required for a tale about human evil.Only a fool could leave this movie thinking Amin was decent. But only a fool could make a film of Amin that didnt treat his inhumanity as more than a character flaw. (Disgraced Amin fled Uganda in 1979 for Iraq and later Saudi Arabia where he died remorseless in 2003.)Forest Whitaker has a gift for disappearing inside a characters fractured state of mind-- think Charlie Parker in ``Bird"" or the assassin in ``Ghost Dog""-- which should have made him ideal to play Amin.But the screenplay by Peter Morgan and Jeremy Brock fails him by giving Amin no ostensible psychology only a desire to charm. Whitaker conveys an intense mess of facial tics and intimidating mannerisms. But what is he thinking? So often Whitaker shrewdly conveys a regressive dimension in the men he plays. But if the filmmakers intend Amins happy-go-lucky demeanor and his reliance upon his advisers as signs of childishness (Nick accuses him of as much) Whitaker sends the character into a cartoonish realm. Hes the tyrant as Yogi Bear.Amin might have been a completely outward character. But for Macdonald to film him repeatedly as a rock star (one press conferences seems like something out of a Jay-Z video) means hes missed the warning of his own cautionary tale. It also speaks curious truth to Amins power. Prolonged exposure to this man even in death can impoverish anybodys judgment. ``The Last King of Scotland"" has too good a time turning a bad education into a titillating horror show.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Fox Searchlight hide caption toggle caption Fox Searchlight The Last King of Scotland View scenes from the film Playing a character who is both loved and feared is a daunting task for any actor. Forest Whitaker embraced just such a challenge in making the film The Last King of Scotland which opens in theaters on Wednesday. Whitaker plays Idi Amin the late Ugandan dictator who took control of the former British colony in the 1970s and ruled with an iron fist. The film follows his story seen through the eyes of a young Scottish doctor who finds himself thrust into Amins inner circle. Both charismatic and cruel Amin was accused of ordering the killings of an estimated 300000 people before he was deposed and forced to flee to Saudi Arabia in 1979. During his rule he gave himself a grandiose title -- His Excellency President for Life Field Marshal Al Hadji Dr. Idi Amin VC DSO MC King of Scotland Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular. Whitaker spent months in Uganda interviewing the dictators family members and also with former government officials. He talked with those who had suffered at the hands of Amin. He even learned enough Swahili so that he could ad-lib dialogue with the Ugandan actors and extras working on the film.

Forest Whitaker gives a terrific ambiguous performance as Idi Amin the army commander in post-colonial Uganda who seized power from President Milton Obote in a military coup in 1971 and who spent the next eight years amusing the world with his bullish and bizarre rhetoric from awarding himself a CBE to claiming kingship rights to Scotland. But with Amins headline-grabbing near-comic banter came a rule of terror expulsion and murder that was peculiarly coloured by the many years Amin served in the British imperial army. The complexity is there for a dramatist to mine and unsurprisingly there have been other films about Amin including two quick-to-screen TV movies Raid on Entebbe and Victory at Entebbe (both 1976) that reacted to the Israeli commando attack on Kampalas airport in 1976 and the fascinating 1974 documentary by Barbet Schroeder General Idi Amin Dada Autoportrait which instigated the taking of French hostages in Kampala until Schroeder made cuts demanded by Amin.But Kevin Macdonalds debut fiction feature as partly scripted by faction scribe du jour Peter Morgan (The Queen) is the first to enjoy the benefit of reflection and hindsight and importantly to be made in Uganda. Its a wise decision that allows cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle - who shoots partly on colour-rich 16mm - to make the most of the countrys period architecture red soils lush vegetation and local extras lending the film a welcome lack of distance or classical sombreness. What emerges is a curious not wholly successful but still smartly conceived blend of fact and fiction - as first imagined by the source novelist Giles Foden. We begin in Scotland in 1971 where the entirely made-up Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) has graduated with a medical degree and spins a globe to plan his escape from a life as a suburban Scottish GP. He - or luck - opts for Uganda where as fate would have it Amin assumes power soon after Garrigans arrival and an encounter between the two men allows the young Scot the opportunity to become personal physician to the president. Its a job he accepts with the sort of blank excitable grin that becomes more annoying the more McAvoy sports it his incredulity itself is incredulous. Surely as green as a Garrigan must now enter the lexicon as a by-phrase for chronic naivety? Were used to being led through African stories by white hands like European or American tourists on safari John Hurt did the job in Shooting Dogs; Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes assumed the honour in The Constant Gardener; and next month Leonardo DiCaprio will do the same in Blood Diamond. Thankfully the same device here offers something more than a safe path through unfamiliar territory. Amin had aspirations towards a perverted idea of Britishness; British journalists indulged the humour in Amins charming behaviour; and Amin even employed a British businessman Bob Astles as a close adviser. In that sense the character of Garrigan who fucks and fiddles while Kampala burns is a clever device that implicates our enjoyment of Whitakers performance and of Idis playboy home life - the parties the 1970s gear the bluesy music - with the sinister real reasons for the smoke that billows on the horizon. True violence only comes very late but when it arrives its stark and unrestrained and focused intensely on two gruesome incidents that have enormous power.Still Garrigans naivety reckless enjoyment of the spoils of an ill state and late awakening to the truth about Amin are sometimes hard to swallow. Its the wily whispered chats of a British foreign office stooge played superbly by a noxious Simon McBurney that are more sinister and instructive of the tightrope walked by Europeans in 1970s Uganda. Its a shame too that the brutal power of Whitakers performance is allowed to fade away in the films closing moments in favour of a not-very-thrilling escape sequence where all the emphasis is on Garrigan rather than Amin or Uganda. That said Macdonalds first attempt at drama after the documentaries One Day in September and Touching the Void must mostly be considered a rousing success - and Whitakers performance alone is a triumph.

Forest Whitaker stars as Idi Amin in The Last King Of Scotland. Photo Fox Searchlight Pictures The Last King of Scotland 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Last King of Scotland is a film so good about a man so monstrous that its shortcomings seem less like flaws than highlights devised to increase the horror. The puniness of one character emphasizes the sickening power of another. The exaggerated swing of the plot -- from pool-party frivolity to repugnance and dread -- intensifies the savagery of the climax. Even the movies dog-tired dependence on a white protagonist to illumine black history clarifies the dangers of being complacent of feeling all too comfortable while atrocities occur. When the movie finally shows those atrocities their lurid overstatement plays up the ugly import of the story. Based on the novel by Giles Foden The Last King of Scotland tells the story of Nicholas Garrigan a young (and fictitious) Scottish doctor who meets and befriends the genocidal (and real) Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Garrigan falls under the spell of the mercurial and Scotland-fixated despot becoming his personal physician confidante and lap-boy during a reign of terror that killed 300000 Ugandans by 1979. At first Nicholas sees nothing of Amins butchery principally because he doesnt want to; hed rather live on Amins property eat Amins food drive Amins Mercedes and wiggle his hips into bell-bottoms sewn by Amins tailor. You might during the first 90 minutes of the film want to clock him. Its a forgivable impulse for Nicholas self-pleasing naivete is rather the point. His seduction by Amin reflects -- with microcosmic stupidity -- our own seduction by this and every other captivating tyrant who has laid waste to humanity while the rest of the world sat idle. James McAvoy (last seen as Mr. Tumnus the darling faun from The Chronicles of Narnia) portrays this paragon of weakness with as much boyish twinkle as he can but its a tough job and an exasperating character. How obscene it feels to say so but Forest Whitakers Amin is a much more likable fellow. He is first of all charming second of all chilling third monumental and he is all three things at once. See the movie for Whitaker alone Hes possessed by evil and possesses it wholly rendering the film (and everyone in it) his plaything. Including Nicholas -- who learns from an a British diplomat (Simon McBurney) that hes been nicknamed Amins ""white monkey."" Otherwise not much is made of skin color -- except the moment when a Ugandan doctor urges Nicholas to ""go home tell the world the truth about Amin. They will believe you. You are a white man."" Youve heard the line if youve seen the theatrical trailer which spoils every major plot point and suggests a violent urgency to the film that doesnt materialize not fully until the final act. Only then do whispers of barbarism come to the fore -- as a disassembled reassembled body or as a brutally graphic torture sequence that repels and demands attention. Before this film Scottish director Kevin Macdonald was best known for the hybrid documentary Touching the Void which mixed interviews and reenactments to tell the tale of an ice-climbing accident in the Peruvian Andes. In it a hiker plunges into a crevasse and hangs on the brink facing death. In The Last King of Scotland Macdonald again brings his audience to the lip of hell. He dares us to look away.

Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy in Kevin Macdonalds fine drama ""The Last King of Scotland"" make a haunting cat-and-mouse pair. As Ugandan dictator Idi Amin Whitakers enormous frame looms on the screen; hes playfully loose but theres an ever-present feeling of menace. When we first meet him the camera pulls in tight as he makes a speech at a rally wild-eyed and jazzed by the attention. In his bedroom he sprawls on a bed adorned by an animal hide complete with snarling head. ""A man who shows fear he is weak and he is a slave"" he says. Nicholas Garrigan a young Scottish doctor in 1970s Uganda on a vague do-good mission is drawn to Amins energy and joins his entourage as the rulers personal physician. Hes thrilled by the post like a groupie in a rock stars entourage; McAvoys skinny pale frame seems to be perpetually prancing. (The actor is best known for playing the faun Tumnus in ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and he still looks like a faun here; theres something slightly untamed about his gangliness.) Hes a kid and he doesnt yet realize that hes signed on with the devil -- that Amins rule would soon become a reign of terror. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""The Last King of Scotland"" with Forest Whitaker James McAvoy Kerry Washington Simon McBurney Gillian Anderson. Directed by Kevin Macdonald from a screenplay by Peter Morgan and Jeremy Brock based on the novel by Giles Foden. 121 minutes. Rated R for some strong violence and gruesome images sexual content and language. Pacific Place Guild 45th. ""The Last King of Scotland"" is fact-based fiction (based on a novel by Giles Foden; Nicholas has no real-life counterpart) but it resonates like the most vivid of history lessons. From the start with director of photography Anthony Dod Mantles jittery hand-held camera work you feel the tension. We know things cant end well for Nicholas or for the seared-brown country hes visiting on a lark but he doesnt know it for much of the film. Macdonald formerly a documentary filmmaker (""One Day in September"" ""Touching the Void"") finds fear in tiny moments Every glance in this environment of fear speaks volumes. Gillian Anderson and Kerry Washington both contribute soulful indelible turns as women caught in unsafe places Anderson as a lonely knowing relief worker; Washington as one of Amins multiple wives. (Anderson strangely seems to disappear from the film fairly early but her performance is remarkable in its ability to create a character and history in just a few scenes. Her Sarah never looks at anyone straight-on; shes always peering sideways not quite sure what to believe.) Ultimately though this is a three-character story -- Amin Nicholas and Uganda -- each in their own way doomed. ""The Last King of Scotland"" in its final scenes builds to nearly unbearable violence and suspense as Whitaker finally reveals the monster behind the smile. Its terrifying but you cant look away. Macdonald has delivered a masterful tragedy told in his characters wary eyes.

Fox Searchlight photo via Associated Press Forest Whitaker as Ugandan President Idi Amin in ""The Last King of Scotland."" Fox Searchlight photo via Associated Press Whitaker mines Amins heart of darkness in King 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Last King of Scotland Drama. Starring Forest Whitaker James McAvoy Kerry Washington and Gillian Anderson. Directed by Kevin Macdonald. (R. 121 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The publics perverse fascination with dictators faded quickly for Idi Amin. Forced from power in 1979 after a decadelong reign of terror that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans he died in obscurity three years ago. Amin did not become the subject of a spate of biopics like those chronicling every step of Hitlers rise and fall. Now that Hollywood belatedly has gotten around to Amin he shares screen time with a fictional character something the self-aggrandizing general surely would have found galling. But the brilliance of ""The Last King of Scotland"" -- an immediate contender for Oscar consideration and a spot on critics top 10 lists -- is the way it shows his dangerous allure through the eyes of an innocent. The central conceit is that on the cusp of his successful coup Amin exuberantly portrayed by Forest Whitaker has a fateful encounter with a Scottish physician. Politically naive Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) has come to Uganda with his freshly minted medical degree to sow some wild oats and incidentally minister to the needy. When the general is injured in a car accident Nicholas the only doctor within miles is called upon to treat him. The two men bond immediately and Amin -- whose affinity for the Scots whom he sees as victims of British oppression much as he is leads him to grandiosely refer to himself as the last king of Scotland -- invites Nicholas to be his personal physician and ultimately his closest confidant. This is spellbinding entertainment filled with unexpected moments of levity that almost make you feel guilty laughing at the antics of a tyrant. Theyre like the ""Springtime for Hitler"" number with no singing and dancing. When Amin becomes convinced that hes been poisoned (an early indication of his paranoia) and demands medical attention in the middle of the night Nicholas correctly diagnoses severe flatulence and has his patient relieve the symptoms by bending over a stick held tightly against his pot belly. Director Kevin Macdonald whose previous experience is limited to documentaries skillfully brings ""Last King"" to life bathing the landscape in pastels and capturing the joviality of the Ugandan people despite the hardships they endure. Screenwriters Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") and Jeremy Brock (""Mrs. Brown"") do a splendid job of adapting Giles Fodens award-winning novel rarely resorting to the sort of annoying voiceover that makes a movie sound like a book on tape. All of this is in service of a truly astonishing screen performance. Followers of Whitakers career (his heartbreaking vulnerability as the doomed soldier in ""The Crying Game"" becomes more memorable with time than its most famous scene) knew he had it in him given material worthy of his talent. He starts out playing Amin as a cuddly clown his large body shaking with mirth only gradually showing glimpses of the madman within. The laugh goes on too long or the look in his eyes abruptly turns malevolent. The red and gold brocade of his military uniform brings out his imperiousness. Like most dictators Amin is a champion seducer whether of the masses who believe his claim that he only wants to help them or of individuals like Nicholas. Whitaker makes these seduction scenes palpable. Unlike Sean Penns demagogue in ""All the Kings Men"" youre able to forget that Whitaker is acting. He embodies the role. When clips of the real Amin are shown at the end its almost shocking to realize the extent to which Whitaker has become him. Just as the doctor is willingly subservient to the dictator McAvoy (the faun in ""The Chronicles of Narnia"") allows Whitaker to upstage him. Its a wise decision keeping the film tilted the way it should be. McAvoy effectively creates a portrait of a confused young man susceptible to Amins charms. Nicholas likes his pleasures. Upon arriving in Uganda he puts the moves on his colleagues wife (an arresting Gillian Anderson who has made fascinating career choices since ""The X-Files""). He begins an affair with one of the Ugandan strongmans several wives (Kerry Washington showing by the terror on her face the fear Amin instills in his women). McAvoy makes clear how easily the doctor can be bought by his unadulterated joy when the dictator presents him with an expensive sports car. So Nicholas chooses not to believe the stories he hears about atrocities committed by his boss. When a suddenly childlike Amin solicits advice on how to spin stories about him being a nut case and a cannibal Nicholas coolly tells him not to banish the press but instead to meet with them and pour on the charm which he does to great effect. At its heart of darkness the film is about the lure of power. Its a condemnation of all the dictators men over all time. Surely some of those who served a Nero or Hussein or Ceausescu had the moral sense to realize that they were aligned with a force of evil. Yet they stuck. Emboldened by Whitakers unforgettable performance ""The Last King"" daringly puts forth reasons for such complicity. -- Advisory Extremely violent and disturbing images.

By  Michael Booth PUBLISHED October 4 2006 at 113 pm | UPDATED May 8 2016 at 232 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive linemen can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Forest Whitaker does far more than inhabit the oversized persona of Idi Amin for ""The Last King of Scotland."" Simply re-creating the Ugandan ""president for life"" would have made Whitaker an immediate Oscar front-runner but like Amin Whitaker doesnt know when to stop. He keeps going and going rumbling and rambling and by the end of this remarkable uneven film we believe that through Whitaker we have come to understand the very nature of power and corruption. Whitaker redeems the movies significant flaws through sheer force of will and skill of performance. Within the course of one speech - ""Here is where civilization began Here is where the Greeks stole their philosophy"" - Whitakers Amin makes us at once admire the dictator and hate the despot. Whitakers cruel mountain of a man provides the gravity when ""The Last King of Scotland"" threatens to float out of control. Director Kevin MacDonald chose to adapt a fictitious white mans story to tell the sprawling unbelievable tale of Amins rise and fall. Novelist Giles Foden imagined the character of Nicholas Garrigan a Scotsman who goes to Uganda as a bush doctor to the poor and winds up as palace physician and wounded conscience for Amin. James McAvoy plays Garrigan and plays him well though thats like saying Catherine Keener was good in ""Capote""; she was but Philip Seymour Hoffman is who youll remember forever. The question arises immediately and never quite goes away Do we again require peripheral white people to paint a portrait of another vital portion of African history? Illustrated by a callow college boy sleeping with exotic astoundingly pliant African women? No we dont but those are the African movies that usually get made. So then the question is how hard the filmmakers have tried to tell us something worthy. In this case quite a lot. Amin remains one of the most charismatic and terrorizing figures in recent history and how a nation can lie in thrall to his grandstanding and his secret police is worth learning. Amin ousted President Milton Obote in a 1971 coup and quickly began rounds of ethnic cleansing to secure power. He ordered 50000 Asians to leave the country undercutting the Ugandan economy. He praised Hitler and the Palestinian thugs who murdered Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics. Death squads carried out his whims; human rights groups estimate 300000 Ugandans died before his regime ended in 1979. Before this wretched excess though Whitaker captures Amins studied man-of-the- people charm. ""I am you"" he bellows to a rural crowd conjuring images of his white counterpart Willie Stark from another movie currently at the multiplex ""All the Kings Men."" Funny thing about these power-mad dictators if theres not a remake on the schedule from Hollywood there are always remakes waiting in real life from Kabul to the Congo. In private Whitakers Amin is even slicker. When he tells Garrigan ""You are my closest adviser"" the declaration hisses howls pleads and threatens all at the same time. As a textbook megalomanic Amins primary skill is to blame others for his defeats I did warn you Garrigan shouts to which Amin says reasonably ""But you did not persuade me"" When Garrigan complains that a colleague he ratted out was killed by Amins forces he whines ""I didnt want him to die"" And Amin grins. Yes but you told on him anyway didnt you? The white mans side of the plot in ""Scotland"" is fairly predictable and more than a little silly upon reflection. Garrigan is seduced by power eventually turns against Amin sleeps with one of Amins wives (always dangerous from democracy to autocracy) and seeks the exit. In Hotel Uganda of course you can check out any time you like but you can never leave. Down to the last Whitaker makes us agree with Amin even as we learn to loathe him. ""I think your death is the first real thing thats ever happened to you"" he says nonsensically but accurately to Garrigan. Putting the white character in his place brings Amin back into proper perspective and Whitakers performance back to the fore where it belongs.

The director Kevin Macdonald searches for clarity amid the contradictions of Marleys life and reaches no conclusions but thats a tribute to his subjects complexity in a film of fascinating too-muchness. ENLARGE Bob Marley in the documentary Marley. Magnolia Pictures Its a concert film of the spoken word with the accent on recollections rather than onstage performance. One after another the people Marley lived with worked with and played with tell their tales in dialects that are always enjoyable for their musicality though sometimes fitted with subtitles for accessibility. The interview subjects range from Marleys widow Rita--the film was made with the familys cooperation--through the surviving member of the Wailers the formidable Bunny Wailer to such deliciously disparate figures as Margaret James his first teacher; Dudley Sibley a singer and the janitor at the Jamaican recording studio where he got his start; his girlfriend and former Miss World Cindy Breakspeare; and his friend Desi Smith who uses the word ""sufferation"" by way of describing the poverty from which Marley rose and to which he beamed back his passion as a third-world superstar and an apostle of black independence before succumbing to cancer in 1981 at the age of 36. As for Marley himself he was notably shy for most of his life and hes an elusive presence in the films relatively few samplings of a limited archive of interview material--at one moment quietly charismatic at another clearly druggy. (With a wink and a nod at the cannabis cognoscenti the film is being released--in theaters and via video on demand--on April 20th which has become a sort of marijuana appreciation day.) ""My heart can be hard as stone yet soft as water"" he says at one point a bit of gnomic self-scrutiny that only hints at the difficulties of pinning him down. A documentary on the life music and legacy of Bob Marley. Video courtesy of Magnolia Pictures. But the importance of defining Marley dwindles alongside the pleasure of learning about his singular life. As a young man smitten by music troubled by his mixed-race heritage and hungry for a higher calling hes inspired by the emperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie who becomes his king of kings after the aging monarch pays a wildly popular visit to Jamaica. (Talk about contradictions Listening to the worshipful strains of Marleys ""Selassie Is the Chapel"" I thought of ""The Emperor"" Ryszard Kapuscinskis remarkable book based on interviews with former ministers and courtiers that portrays Selassies court in the last years of his reign as a place of obscene excess surrounded by poverty and of pervasive fear bordering on madness.) In the fullness of his fame--which was late to extend to the U.S.--Marley returns to Jamaica as the emperor of a musical realm and shortly after being shot plays a peace concert to calm the nation at a flash point in its history. The films 144-minute running time gives a sense that the filmmaker couldnt let a single frame fall to the cutting room floor. Mr. Macdonalds new documentary is neither as polished nor--unavoidably given the subject--as powerful as ""One Day in September"" his Oscar-winning account of the Palestinian terrorist attack on the Israeli team at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. Still too-muchness is no sin and no one can accuse ""Marley"" of not-enoughness. The Lucky One ENLARGE Taylor Schilling as Beth and Zac Efron as Logan in The Lucky One adapted from the Nicholas Sparks novel. Warner Bros. Pictures Depending on how you feel about Zac Efron he is either a sensitive hunk or an inexpressive hunk but definitely a hunk. Unable as I am to locate any feelings about him I see Mr. Efron as a hunk with a problem delivering sustained dialogue in units of more than one or two sentences. The camera is conflicted about seeing him in ""The Lucky One"" which was directed by Scott Hicks. Whenever possible it dotes on his handsome face but turns away to other actors for reaction shots during his speeches which seem to have been pieced together from extremely short takes. A Marine travels to North Carolina after serving three tours in Iraq and searches for the unknown woman he believes was his good luck charm during the war. Video courtesy of Warners. The production as a whole has been pieced together quite smoothly from the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks whose books spawn backlit scenes of wounded souls working out their fates. (Alar Kivilo did the sumptuous cinematography.) Mr. Efrons Logan a Marine Corps sergeant is back from his third tour of duty in Iraq where he found a photo of a beautiful woman. Next thing you know--well next thing after a little detective work and a solitary walk from Colorado to Louisiana--hes at the door of her family-run kennel looking for work. Her name is Beth and shes played attractively by Taylor Schilling who survived hard duty as the heroine of last years ghastly ""Atlas Shrugged."" Beth resists Logan as long as she can--he tends to creep her out because he cant tell her why hes come--but things work out for them in a plot that resembles a game of checkers rather than chess. Blythe Danner graces her every scene as Beths mother. Jay R. Ferguson is Beths ex-husband Keith a heavy who redefines overwrought. The kennels dogs are mostly playful and the movie uses exactly the right amount of Spanish moss. To the Arctic 3-D ENLARGE Polar bears relax in To the Arctic 3D. Warner Bros. Pictures IMAX films are nothing if not immersive but theyre also confrontive. The first awesome image that confronts you in this one wont be mistaken for the white cliffs of Dover. Its a vast white glacier that is melting via waterfalls notched in its face in an Arctic that is warming Meryl Streeps narration tells us twice as fast as any other region of the planet. The films subject is polar bears--did you know as I did not that these white giants began as brown bears and have adapted to their habitat over the course of 150000 years?--but global warming is its subtext and sometimes it isnt so sub. A 3D journey into the lives of a mother polar bear and her two seven-month-old cubs as they navigate the changing Arctic wilderness they call home. Video courtesy of Warners. ""To the Arctic 3-D""--the 3-D is neither impressive nor intrusive--can and should be seen in a number of IMAX theaters and science museums around the country; later it will go into more general distribution. The superb nature footage takes in walruses and caribou as well as bears but bears are at the center of the frozen stage cavorting and snuggling on ever-shrinking ice floes when the temperature is 30 degrees below zero. And the stars tracked by cameras at close range for nearly a week are a mother and her twin cubs heedless kidlets who delight in the deep freeze but are threatened by roving males. (They prey on defenseless cubs when they cant make meals of seals that are increasingly hard to come by as the changing climate and degrading habitat take their toll.) For all the majesty of the photography I was bothered at first by the insistent score which uses songs by Paul McCartney as well as original music by Steve Wood. But then the insistence came clear as an emotional strategy. ""To the Arctic 3-D"" is an impassioned plea for action on global warming and the passion is intensified by the music. Watch the mother nestle her cubs to the strains of ""Calico Skies""--""It was written that I would love you""--and you want to weep then buy a solar panel. The Last King of Scotland (2006) Kevin Macdonalds powerful drama is action-packed although ultimately to a fault and built around a starring performance that embodies the classic notion of what actors are supposed to do--act on the characters around them with all the psychic and physical energy at their command. Forest Whitakers portrayal of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin is enormous mercurial terrifying endlessly seductive and more simply put one of the great performances of modern movie history. This monster is a psychopath but also a charmer and a narcissist with a deadly gift for sensing the needs of others. Touching the Void (2003) In this thrilling re-creation of a now-legendary story Kevin Macdonald who adapted Joe Simpsons nonfiction book of the same name straddles the space between fiction film and documentary. The film is about existential choice that of a mountaineer with a grievously injured partner who will or wont cut the partner loose to save himself. As the details unfold you forget that youre watching actors playing the climbers both in straight-to-the-camera interviews and in brilliantly staged vignettes on the face of the mountain. In ""Touching the Void"" the end of the rope is but the beginning. The Notebook (2004) Top-drawer Nicholas Sparks on screen directed impeccably by Nick Cassavetes. Ripe with feeling and lush with physical beauty its a love story that swings confidently between age and youth. The focus is mainly on youth in a narrative that has James Garner and Gena Rowlands as a husband and wife near the end of their days--her memory is almost gone--and Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as passionate lovers. Youth may be wasted on the young but not in a movie where its seen as a glorious rehearsal for age. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

With Forest Whitaker James McAvoy Gillian Anderson. (121 min.)Coincidentally this week in addition to ""The Queen"" we also have a movie about a king. ""The Last King of Scotland"" (which even has a script co-written by ""The Queens"" screenwriter Peter Morgan) is about the murderous reign of Ugandas Idi Amin Dada and stars Forest Whitaker in a performance of breathtaking originality. Kevin Macdonald a documentarian (""One Day in September"" ""Touching the Void"") making his dramatic feature debut has a haphazard visual style but he knows what he has in Whitaker. It would have been easy for the actor to play Idi Amin as a buffoonish butcher but he gets inside the insidious malice of the man. The young Scottish doctor he appoints as his personal physician (James McAvoy) is seduced by all the bullying pomp and he is meant to be a stand-in for all those who have cozied up to tyrants. McAvoys progression from awe to horror is predictable and the film could have gone deeper into the legacy of British imperialism that gave rise to the Idi Amins of the world. But Whitakers performance dispels most of ones objections. He is terrifying in a way that we recognize not from old movies but from life. Grade B+ - Peter RainerOpen Season (PG)Director Roger Allers Jill Culton. With Ashton Kutcher Martin Lawrence Debra Messing. (99 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The trouble with baby bears is that they grow up. Ranger Beth (voiced by Messing) has rescued Boog an orphaned cub raising him in her garage. Now Boog (Lawrence) is a full-size grizzly and nothing can keep him out of the convenience store. The sheriff orders him back to the wild - just as hunting season is about to begin. Boog acquires a pint-sized sidekick Eliot the deer (Kutcher) and they lead the other animals in a scheme to rid their turf of hunters. Its wittily written and animated but the lovely painted backdrops look decidedly 2-D in the 3-D version. Grade B- - M. K. Terrell Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test?

Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco None.School for Scoundrels (PG-13)Director Todd Phillips. With Billy Bob Thornton Jon Heder Jacinda Barrett. (100 min.)Self-worth is not in Rogers vocabulary. After losing his parking patrol uniform to armed thugs Roger (Heder) is ready for some assertiveness training. He joins a class under the mysterious Dr. P (Thornton) whose first assignment is to go out and start a fight with someone. Roger soon has enough confidence to ask the woman down the hall for a date. Everythings rosy until Roger suspects the good doctor is making a play for his girl. This mostly amusing comedy flags after a while but comes together in a wild finale.

Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 1 scene of smoking; 4 scenes of drinking.Still in ReleaseThe U.S. vs. John Lennon (PG-13)Director David Leaf John Scheinfeld. With Walter Cronkite John Lennon (archive footage) G. Gordon Liddy (96 min.)In 1972 the Nixon White House was conflicted. John Lennon was drawing support for antiwar causes which could hurt Nixons bid for reelection. Deporting the Lennons could turn even more voters against him. In the end the FBI amassed a thick file on the Lennons and they were ordered out of the country. This fascinating documentary shows how far government will go to throttle opposition but also how sometimes you can fight the establishment and win.

Flowers. With Orlando Bloom Bill Paxton Zoe Saldana. (115 min.)The tax-exempt Cayman Islands are a sort of Caribbean Swiss bank but officials are cracking down big-time on shady finances. A professional money launderer (Stephen Dillane) offers to save his skin by informing on a client (Paxton) who has fled there from US investigators. The movie following what seem at first to be subplots involving small-time hoods and forbidden love shows how corruption drug dealing and racial tension have infected the native population turning this Eden into a kind of Gomorrah.

"The Queen and The Last King of Scotland reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Queen and The Last King of Scotland reviewed. The Queen and The Last King of Scotland reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 27 2006 1155 PM King and Queen Two royal portraits The Queen and The Last King of Scotland. By Dana Stevens Forest Whitaker in The Last King of Scotland Screenwriter Peter Morgan is having a big week with two of his movies The Queen (Miramax) and The Last King of Scotland (Fox Searchlight Pictures) opening just two days apart. Though the viewing experience of these two films couldnt be more different both are political fictions about real-life leaders who each in their way allow power to turn them into monsters. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Obviously Queen Elizabeth II of Englands monstrousness is on a whole other scale from that of Idi Amin the bloodthirsty former dictator of Uganda. She struggles with how best to cope with the cultural shifts of a rapidly modernizing Britain while he struggles with how best to track down his enemies and feed them to crocodiles. But Morgans portraits of the two rulers have something in common. Hes interested in the way tradition and sycophancy shield the powerful from criticism and how reality eventually finds its way through that shield. Both movies remind us of the simple but easily obscured truth that politics in the end always comes down to people not just ""the people"" but real living individuals with their appetites histories fears and desires. Advertisement The Last King of Scotland (co-scripted by Jeremy Brock) filters the corruption and violence of Amins regime through the eyes of Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) a young Scottish doctor who arrives in Uganda in the early 70s with a thirst for adventure and a vague desire to do good. Garrigan takes a job at a rural health clinic where he lamely attempts a fling with a married co-worker (Gillian Anderson looking strangely like Virginia Madsen). A visit from Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) the president who has just overthrown the corrupt Obote regime has a galvanizing effect on Garrigan; hes charmed by Amins boisterous personality and common touch. At Amins invitation Garrigan moves to the capital to become the generals private doctor lured by promises that hell be put in charge of national health-care reform. That promise never materializes but soon the young Scotsman is driving his own Mercedes convertible and drinking imported liquor--lots and lots of it as he tries to blot out his growing awareness of the methods his boss uses to prop up his power. These methods include coercion and bribery offenses Garrigan is able to rationalize away as the inevitable grease in the wheels of African politics. But as the generals critics begin disappearing with disturbing regularity Garrigan is forced to do battle with his own conscience--a battle he loses spectacularly. At first naive then bungling and finally despicable the doctor is a self-serving coward who earns his derogatory nickname the ""white chimp."" Hes an uneasy character to have to identify with but The Last King of Scotland (named like the novel its based on for one of the fanciful titles Amin gave himself) leaves you little choice. Unlike Hotel Rwanda (2004) it doesnt give you a likeable African protagonist through whom to process the horrors of torture and genocide. The Last King of Scotland never rises to the standard set by Forest Whitakers fearless (and fearsome) performance as Idi Amin. Whitaker clearly has it in him to plumb the psychological recesses of this curiously playful madman but the director Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September) doesnt ask him to. Instead Amin serves as a backdrop for the story of Garrigans moral degeneration. The early encounters between the two men are convincingly fraught with menace but the last 20 minutes feel like a pat political thriller with Garrigans attempted escape from Uganda dovetailing too neatly with the 1976 Israeli raid on a hijacked jet in Entebbe. This climactic escape sequence also includes a torture scene so graphic and stomach-churning it makes The Passion of the Christ look like Operation Dumbo Drop. The Last King of Scotland is wrenching to sit through but in the end it doesnt leave you with quite enough to think about.  Advertisement Stephen Frears The Queen on the other hand is a sheer delight to sit through and leaves you with a whole evenings worth of impassioned conversation. Its a thoroughly fictionalized but altogether plausible reconstruction of the days following the death of Princess Diana in 1997. Why was the royal family so famously slow to make any public acknowledgement of Dianas death? What might the dialogue have been between Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) and the then-new prime minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) about how to respond to the loss of a woman who even after her divorce from Prince Charles remained a potent symbol for the British people? And when the queen finally did address her people on the eve of Dianas funeral with a speech of unprecedented warmth what combination of political spin media bullying and genuine emotion went into its preparation? The Queen takes these questions apart with the psychological precision of a great novel. (Henry James comes to mind given the resonance the movie grants to tiny violations of politesse.) Its tone is curious; its a political comedy thats not a satire and a story of mass grief thats not a tragedy. Dianas death is dispatched in one brief oblique scene (one that clearly lays the blame for the crash at the feet of the paparazzi then abandons the matter entirely) and Frears discretion is so extreme that we never see the princesss face except in old news footage. After Dianas death the film cuts between the Prime Ministers residence at 10 Downing St. and the queens summer retreat at Balmoral as the government and the crown ponder their next move with the deliberation of two chess masters. But the queen and the P.M. are not only opposing players with very different conceptions of the uses of power; theyre also co-governors of Britain with a common interest in the well-being of their people. The clash of wills that follows and the compromise that results makes for one of the smartest political films Ive seen in years whether documentary or fiction. Michael Sheen is an absolute ringer for Tony Blair and has already played him under Frears direction in a British TV movie The Deal. As a non-British subject I cant comment on how accurate his Blair impersonation is but it doesnt matter; he creates a whole believable character whos sympathetic enough to make you almost sorry for the prime ministers recent public farewell (he plans to step down in 2007). Helen Mirren as Ive written before in these pages can do no wrong. Shes a goddess of an actress and her Queen Elizabeth is maddening hilarious and deeply human galumphing around the Balmoral estate in a tartan raincoat and waders as the Britain she thought she knew crumbles around her. After seeing The Queen you may want to go out with your viewing companion for a stimulating discussion over crumpets and tea; after The Last King of Scotland youre more likely to visit the theaters restroom to throw up. But both movies take on political giants who could easily have become coarse caricatures (of evil in Amins case and of tradition-bound conventionality in Elizabeths) and instead show them as the contradictory figures they really were and are.

By Christy Lemire updated 9/28/2006 34016 PM ET 2006-09-28T194016 Print Font + - REVIEW Weve seen Forest Whitaker do this on one of the best shows on television ""The Shield."" As an internal affairs lieutenant whose methods are just as unorthodox as those of the rogue detective squad hes investigating Whitaker has been mesmerizing in his volatility. He can sidle on up to you as the sweetest gentlest giant one minute then fly into a vicious rage the next. He makes both sides of this complicated figure feel frighteningly real. And so on the big screen his emotional depth and range are even more stunning in one of the years best movies ""The Last King of Scotland."" This is not hyperbole. This is how good Whitaker is He actually makes you feel sorry for Idi Amin. The suggestion already has been duly bandied about so we may as well acknowledge it here as well His performance is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Under the direction of Kevin Macdonald (""Touching the Void"") making his feature debut Whitaker gets plenty of room to demonstrate the vastly contradictory facets of the larger-than-life Ugandan dictator. Macdonald uses many of the same technical tactics from his documentary background making you feel as if you are there showing you how easy it might have been to be seduced by this charismatic character who also happened to be a cold-blooded killer. Advertise Advertise Advertise Functioning as our guide through this shadowy world is James McAvoy starring as Nick Garrigan a young Scottish doctor who becomes Amins personal physician then his captive adviser. But Macdonald and screenwriters Jeremy Brock Peter Morgan and Joe Penhall working from Giles Fodens novel dont just depict Nick as the innocent in this fictionalized tale. When he lands in the African nation fresh out of medical school -- and just as President Obete is being overthrown in a coup -- his intentions initially seem altruistic. One look around the waiting room packed with poor families and echoing with the din of crying babies shows him he has his work cut out for him -- and the look on his face is one of many examples of Macdonald allowing an actor to speak volumes with just a subtle glance. But then Nicks advances toward a married colleague (Gillian Anderson doing a perfect British accent) reveal the first glimmers of a darker side. And when he meets Amin during a roadside confrontation he captures the dictators attention by proving he can match him in confidence. It doesnt take long for Amin to persuade Nick to abandon his mission and come work for him. And who could blame him? Life at the palace is good a non-stop orgy of women and drink a celebration of wretched excess with Amin as its charming generous host. It would be hard for anyone to turn that down.

Every on-screen drink in Mad Men in 5 minutes See the Dancing stars most memorable moves Emmys biggest snubs? Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom The proximity to power becomes intoxicating but Nick also gets close enough to Amin to see his weaknesses his insecurities his paranoia -- and at times become the victim of them. The man who ultimately would be responsible for the deaths of 300000 Ugandans in the 1970s often comes off as nothing more than an overgrown child throwing a tantrum when he doesnt get what he wants. Whitaker vividly shows us this element of Amins personality as well as he trembles and sweats in his ornate bedroom his eyes bulging with fear. Its a far cry from the man whos arrogant enough to claim he knows exactly when hes going to die and how. Soon Nick is giving Amin advice on more that just his health but on policy and media manipulation. He likes that too -- and he likes Amins beautiful third wife (Kerry Washington) though their secret relationship will provide some plot twists that make ""The Last King of Scotland"" a little too implausible as it reaches its harrowing conclusion. Thats the main sensation that youll have walking out of the film -- that you witnessed something harrowing. And sexy and thrilling and even fun. But mostly its just scary as hell with a hell of a performance from an actor who despite excellent work in films like ""Bird"" and ""Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai"" has too long been overlooked. Until now. (c) 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.

The self-proclaimed flourishes so silly and even so playful contrast all the more obscenely with the reality of Amins brutality Mercurial and paranoid he presided over the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of people even while his charisma and flamboyant eccentricities continued to charm the international press. Here was a monster who could turn from clown to executioner in a blink. Adapted from the acclaimed 1998 novel of the same name by Giles Foden The Last King of Scotland takes its title from another of Amins idiosyncrasies The African despot had a fondness for all things Scot. And I cant think of a better actor to toggle between media-savvy jester and stone-cold killer than Forest Whitaker who even dressed in a kilt conveys serious menace along with mania. A massively built man who projects the energy and nimbleness of someone daintier he barrels through this story with great control masquerading as recklessness. Yet Amin is just half the story -- and Whitaker given such rich source material carries the easier half. The movie views Amin through the eyes of his personal physician in a highly novelistic interpretation of reality. (Amin did have a Scottish doctor but this one is a fabrication.) Recent med school grad Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) naive as Candide arrives in Uganda on a whim partly to do good and partly to party which he does almost immediately with a fellow doctors wife (Gillian Anderson). Garrigan is intrigued by Amin and blind to his luxury-loving employers evil far longer than he should be. Eventually though -- and in an escalation of stakes that tips the movie into the realm of overheated thriller -- the truth becomes a threat to his life. The conclusion suggests quite questionably that only through the testimony of white men like the doctor could black Ugandans influence world awareness of Amin as a mass murderer. The balance of star power would appear to be off-kilter -- McAvoy so slight and Orlando Bloomish in a fictional role against Whitaker who is so substantial in an all-stops-out biographical re-creation. But that disparity turns out to be the point on which the picture pivots. Drawing on a documentary visual style he deftly employed in One Day in September and Touching the Void director Kevin Macdonald uses McAvoys boyishness to treat Garrigans apolitical foolishness as yet another damn mess in one African countrys hell. Indeed the existence of people like Garrigan is one more reason why someone like Amin prevailed for as long and as tragically as he did.

"Last King of Scotland The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; last-king-of-scotland-the ) Last King of Scotland The (United Kingdom 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Last King of Scotland in addition to having one of the most misleading titles of any movie to open this Oscar season could also be 2006s Hotel Rwanda. Like last years sadly overlooked feature this one peers into another troubled African nation Uganda. The Last King of Scotland explores the turmoil and troubles surrounding the beginning of one of the countrys darkest recent periods the Idi Amin regime which lasted from 1971 through 1979 and resulted in thousands upon thousands of deaths. (The exact number is unknown but is estimated to be between 80000 and 500000.) Based on actual events the movie takes us into Amins inner circle through the eyes of an outsider who is initially charmed by the charismatic leader until Amins true nature begins to bubble to the surface. In 1971 newly graduated Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) quits Scotland for Uganda to escape the talons of his overbearing father. Nicholas arrives in the African nation around the time that a military coup puts General Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) into power. Amin is a magnetic and popular leader. When he is injured in an automobile accident Nicholas is the nearest doctor and he is brought to attend to the wound. Amin is taken with the young Scotsman and offers him a position as personal physician to the President. Its a job Nicholas cant refuse although he will come to wish he had done so. At first his experience living at Amins residence is entirely positive but as the rulers paranoia begins to assert itself Nicholas discovers that no one is safe. His own status is tenuous especially since he is having an affair with Amins neglected third wife (Kerry Washington). Every day Amin relies more on his soldiers and less on his non-military advisors and his enemies begin disappearing en masse. Although Amin is not the lead character he is the focal point of the narrative. This is about the dissolution of his character. At the outset he is an affable charismatic man an individual with great aspirations for his country. His descent into paranoia and butchery is shown to be a gradual process although there are plenty of warning signs which no one heeds. As Amin rightly points out Nicholas views his participation in the Ugandan government as something of a game until hes in too deep to be able to extricate himself without help. The British government is all too willing to provide that aid but theres a price to pay and Nicholas is no assassin. Solid performances help make this a worthwhile film. McAvoy who is probably best known as Mr. Tumnnus in The Chronicles of Narnia shows range as Nicholas - from the light-hearted outgoing doctor who enters Uganda to the trapped fearful man who finds his options narrowing as his position as Amins ""trusted advisor"" becomes tenuous. Forest Whitaker is a scene-stealer bringing the right mix of passion charisma and monstrosity to his portrayal of the Ugandan leader. Whitakers Amin is larger than life - a figure equally capable of inspiring great love and great terror. Gillian Anderson has a supporting role as the wife of a doctor with whom Nicholas first works upon his arrival in Uganda. The Last King of Scotland does not refrain from showing the brutality of what Amins reign becomes. The film contains its share of gruesome images including a torture scene that depicts in unflinching detail what happens to someone who betrays Amin. Director Kevin Macdonald has fashioned a film that is at times nearly as harrowing as his previous endeavor Touching the Void. The Last King of Scotland isnt for everyone but for those who can stomach its brutality it offers a compelling look into how such a popular leader became known as one of Africas most vicious dictators of the 1970s.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review All Hail The Queen And bow down to Helen Mirren. A wonderful film about cool clueless Elizabeth in the days after Diana. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis (Photo Laurie Sparham/Courtesy of Miramax Films.) The Queen the sublime comedy of (grand) manners directed by Stephen Frears centers on the face of Helen Mirren as Elizabeth IIa face that barely bestirs itself. That doesnt mean shes inexpressive. Shortly after the death of Diana Princess of Wales as public dismay builds at the lack of a statement from Buckingham Palace Mirrens queen watches Diana sniffle through an old TV interview over her treatment at the hands of the unfeeling royals. The queen neither snorts nor sighs She simply stares at her late daughter-in-law on the screen her eyes widening ever so slightly. Yet its uncanny how many emotions bleed through Mirrens regal mask distaste horror pity regret bewilderment and perhaps something elseenvy. Like her Elizabethan namesake (whom Mirren also impersonated recently on HBO) Elizabeth II considers it her duty to rise above her private feelings to function as a symbol for her people. That this Diana person a member of the royal family could have allowed herself to be so open so histrionic so overflowingly human To the queen it is a mystery with no bottom. What a challenge Frears and the screenwriter Peter Morgan have set for themselves to dramatize the conflict between a pretty vulnerable young woman and a frumpy emotionally stunted monarchand to turn our normal sympathies topsy-turvy so that the former is absent while the latter is our damsel in distress. How can they give this stubborn blinkered coddled woman who cant even grieve like a human being an ounce of dramatic stature? BACKSTORYIn 1977 Idi Amin famously declared himself His Excellency President for Life Field Marshal Al-Hadji Doctor Idi Amin VC DSO MC Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular. He was deposed in 1979. Other presidents for life were Napoleon Bonaparte (declared in 1802 deposed in 1814) and Sukarno of Indonesia (declared in 1963 deposed in 1965). Saparmurat Niyazov of Turkmenistan (declared in 1999) is the only one left though hes promised free and fair elections by 2010. The obvious way is by casting Dame Helen who is peerless when it comes to playing characters trapped in roles to which society has assigned them. In a sort of overture Elizabeth poses for a portrait while keeping tabs on the election that will sweep Tony Blair into officeBlair the youthful studiously informal Labour upstart whose wife is a renowned anti-monarchist. Confiding sadly to the artist that she wishes she could just once be joyfully partisan this plain woman turns toward the camera raises her eyebrows and assumes the queenliest of miens as the titleThe Queenfades in majestically. Its the movies only wink at the audience but its hilarious and its enough It primes you to scrutinize Mirrens face for signs of tension between the woman and the sovereign. It also primes you to marvel at the will it takes to keep up appearances when virtually everyone on earth thinks youre both scarily heartless and laughably out of touch. We all did of course We might have been divided on the subject of Dianas beatitude but there was no disagreement about the royals cluelessness. Much of The Queen has the quality of a disaster film in which idiots ignore the volcano up the road spewing ever-larger gobs of lava. Elizabeth insists that the mourning will be quiet with dignity that there will be no public funeral for an ex-royal that this is a private matter for her family. You say there will be an international outpouring of grief on an undreamed-of scale? An absurd notion. You say the queen should address the nation to help her people cope with the loss? The subjects would desire no such thing. After fairly begging Elizabeth to reckon with reality as well as with the excoriating headlines and widespread calls for an end to the monarchyBlair (Michael Sheen) gazes heavenward and cries Will someone please save these people from themselves? If The Queen is the story of Elizabeth and Dianas disastrous antipathy its also the tale of Liz and Tonys fortunate symbiosis. Showing the kind of deference to authority that would one day lead him down the garden path with an even more shortsighted (and considerably stupider) world leader the prime minister behaves with a chivalry that not even he seems fully to comprehend. Sheen is slighter and more chipmunk-like than his real-life model but its hard to imagine a more generous portraitor a more deliciously impudent turn by Helen McCrory as his wife Cherie. You love Cherie when she makes an ironic show of backing out of the queens drawing room (one must never turn ones back on Her Majesty) and you love Elizabeth for registering the affront while keeping her smile firmly in place. Its hard not to love everyone in this movie except the charmless Prince Philip (James Cromwell) whose exclamations are unfailingly snobbish and dull. Even Charles (Alex Jennings) is a figure more to be pitied than censured. Hes always piping up about changing times and the need to be flexibleand you see him through his mothers eyes not so much flexible as boneless. Ive rarely seen body language more amusing than Jenningss when he directs his chief of staff to make overtures to Blair behind his mothers back (The prince feels that you and he are modern men); he leans away from the phone as if afraid it will turn into Mummy and whack off his head. 1 2 Next Share this story...

A supersized performance by Forest Whitaker dominates ""The Last King of Scotland"" and rightfully so as he portrays one of recent historys great monsters General Idi Amin Dada of Uganda. Helmer Kevin Macdonalds plunge into full-fledged dramatic filmmaking after the partial crossover from documentaries in ""Touching the Void"" starts well but trips over preposterous plot developments as it pushes toward its climax. Unusual material and a measure of critical acclaim will give this Fox Searchlight title a decent shot at good biz in specialized release. Hugely charming when he wants to be but with a changeability that can turn on a dime to appalling evil Whitakers Amin is a man with an iron whim who engages a Scottish doctor as his personal physician after being impressed with his handling of a roadside emergency. This is a fictionalized version of the dictators rise wallow in excess and lurch toward the abyss as seen by the brash young medic based on the acclaimed 1998 novel by Giles Foden. One improvement screenwriters Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") and Jeremy Brock (""Mrs. Brown"") make at the outset is turning the relatively bland do-gooder Scotsman of the book into a brash cocky young adventurer whos ready for anything. Upgrade results in a Nicholas Garrigan agreeably if not always sympathetically played by James McAvoy whos not only more entertaining than his counterpart on the printed page but more plausible as a devil-may-care guy who boldly speaks his mind to Amin while others cower in fright. Picking Uganda virtually at random as a place where his new medical degree could be put to good use Nicholas is first stationed at a remote village where he instantly puts the moves on older woman Sarah Merrit (Gillian Anderson) the attractive wife of the areas hard-working British physician (Adam Kotz). Its 1971 and together Nicholas and Sarah attend a rousing back-country rally where Amin having just ousted the countrys corrupt communist-leaning leader Milton Obote dazzles the locals as well as the naive newcomer to Sarahs consternation. After the presidents injured hand is neatly bandaged by Nicholas and he realizes the heritage of his chance benefactor Amin who long served in the Kings African Rifles sings the praises of the Scottish deeming them among the bravest fighters on Earth. Director Macdonald a Scotsman himself stages a hilarious scene in which Amin appears at a public ceremony wearing a kilt surrounded by Africans performing a Scottish song. Any misgivings erased by Amins evident affinity for him not to mention the leaders genuinely ingratiating persuasiveness Nicholas accepts his new job and immediately reaps the rewards a nice apartment within the immaculate presidential compound a Mercedes convertible women personally selected by Amin and above all unrestricted access to the big boss himself who deliberately denigrates other members of his inner circle by calling Nicholas his closest adviser. An alarming episode that only serves to strengthen the bond between the two men has Amin impulsively asking Nicholas to drive him to the airport in the convertible. En route Amins limousine traveling ahead is ambushed by gunmen. The aftermath when the would-be assassins are dealt with reveals to Nicholas the extent of Amins fury for the first time. This entire first section is quite engaging for several reasons the fluky circumstances creating the main characters bond (Amins actual physician was Scottish although much older) Whitakers utterly convincing portrayal of Amins larger-than-life appeal and moodiness and the view the film provides of a rarely seen location the attractively modern capital Kampala. This is reportedly the first Western production to shoot in Uganda since the second unit of ""The African Queen"" 56 years ago and certainly the first time its main city has been shown. To have the action play out in its proper setting adds immensely to pics interest. Before long however intimations of Amins misdeeds begin accumulating; judges rival politicians and others go ""missing"" and Nicholas gets in hot water when he treats one of his bosss many children an epileptic boy and becomes ill-advisedly involved with the mother Kay (Kerry Washington) an out-of-favor wife of the president. No matter how impudent Nicholas is capable of being and no matter how drunk at the time his rash decision to get it on with a Mrs. Amin is ludicrous; its a ruinous narrative ploy that signals the undue melodrama that overtakes the picture from this point on. Nicholas fate and efforts to escape Uganda are linked to the pro-Palestinian hijacking of an Air France and the subsequent Israeli raid on Entebbe Airport during which he suffers cruel and unusual punishment of the same nature as that endured by Richard Harris in ""A Man Called Horse."" In the end ""The Last King of Scotland"" is much better when it plays it cool and amusing than when it tries to ramp up outrage and indignation. Among its grace notes is the equivocal portrayal of British interests in the former colony most prominently repped by an oily persistent Foreign Service officer (an effective Simon McBurney) whos not as clueless as he seems. The debauchery of Amins private life is glancingly conveyed by raucous party scenes; at one of them Amin watches ""Deep Throat"" and seeks Nicholas expert advice on the physiological possibility of Linda Lovelaces purported clitoral condition. Drama moves along speedily although theres a hasty unartful look to the picture in general that lacks distinction.
