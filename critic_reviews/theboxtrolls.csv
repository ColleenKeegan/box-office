A British-flavored 3-D stop motion affair The Boxtrolls channels more than a little Monty Python in telling its Tarzan-inspired story about a human boy who is raised by creatures called Boxtrolls. With top-notch animation effective voice casting and a screenplay that falters only toward the end when faced with the need to provide a resolution The Boxtrolls offers solid entertainment for older children and the parents that accompany them. What are Boxtrolls? Odd-looking gnome-like creatures that wear boxes like clothing and skitter around the streets at night scavenging for bric-a-brac. Their wide glowing eyes and wizened appearance makes them frightening to humans and all sorts of unsavory legends have grown up around them they steal children eat people and live in a place where the bones of their victims are piled high. In truth theyre meek creatures whose first inclination upon being frightened is to hide. Their language recalls the sounds Jawas made in the first Star Wars movie; in fact one wonders whether Boxtrolls might be Jawas without the robes. Human boy Eggs (voice of Isaac Hempstead Wright) has lived with the Boxtrolls since he was about two years old. His surrogate parents are a long lanky troll called Fish (Dee Bradley Baker) and the squat foul-tempered Shoe (Steve Blum). Eggs is happy living in the underground cavern the Boxtrolls have made their home and workplace until the arrival of Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) a ""red hat"" who has vowed to rid Cheesebridge of its nighttime menace for a price admission to the ""white hat"" elite led by Lord Portley-Rind (Jared Harris). After having secured Portley-Rinds agreement Snatcher begins his campaign against the Boxtrolls (capturing them and putting them to work in his sweatshop) but he hasnt reckoned with the involvement of Eggs or Portley-Rinds perky daughter Winnie (Elle Fanning). The Boxtrolls allegorical aspects are obvious but thats not inappropriate for a movie with this target demographic. The petty concerns evidenced by Cheesbridges ruling body makes a pointed observation about government dysfunction. Why build a new childrens hospital when the same amount of money will buy a huge cheese wheel? Pork barrel spending indeed. Theres also a positive message to go along with the cynical one you can be whoever and whatever you want to be; your limitations dont have to be dictated by others. The films stop-motion visual aesthetic is sufficiently different that it doesnt feel like a clone of every Pixar/Dreamworks animated film out there. The human characters have the slightly exaggerated appearance of claymation creations and the Boxtrolls are weird-looking without being too scary for kids. The detailed set design creates a sense of atmosphere thats spookier than what one finds in generic animated fare. Both directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi come to The Boxtrolls with strong backgrounds in the field. Annable worked on Coraline and Paranoman (direct ancestors to this movie both made by the same animation studio) and Stacci was involved in Antz and James and the Giant Peach. Although this is technically an American movie it feels British. Nearly everyone (including Elle Fanning) speaks with a British accent. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg two of the reigning kings of U.K. comedy provide voice work. And Monty Pythons fingerprints are all over things. How about a one-ton weight? Or a closing song written by Eric Idol? Or a climactic scene that is lifted directly from the Mr. Creosote skit in The Meaning of Life? And now for something completely different indeed. Although the story is solid the vocal work is competent (especially by Ben Kingsley as the despicable Snatcher) and the visuals are impressive the overall appeal is diminished by the vanilla nature of the lead character. Put simply Eggs isnt all that interesting. He doesnt leave much of an impression. Winnie isnt much stronger. Since these two represent The Boxtrolls emotional center its a noticeable failing that keeps this movie from ascending into the upper echelon of animated films. The Boxtrolls is engaging and will entertain children and adults but it doesnt stand out as great revolutionary or memorable.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post There comes a moment in ""The Boxtrolls"" when a terrific allergic reaction of social-striving baddie Archibald Snatcher elicits an understandably revolted ""Ewww"" There are many more delighted ""Ewwws"" than too-easy ""Awws"" in this charming if a tad cynical feature from the creators of ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman."" ""The Boxtrolls"" takes its inspiration from Alan Snows 2005 fantasy novel ""Here Be Monsters"" And there are indeed monstrous goings-on in this 90-minute yarn extracted from a 500-plus-page tome. It was adapted by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava and is co-directed by Antony Stacchi and Graham Annable. ""The Boxtrolls"" begins with the disappearance of an infant. The Trubshaw Baby becomes the sort of legend that keeps parents anxious and feeds kids nightmares. It is a dark yarn one particular Cheese-bridge resident is all too happy to exploit. Boxtroll exterminator Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) has hopes of moving up in society and trading in his red hat for the ""white hat"" of the muckety-mucks. If the sorry elites seem to care more about Brie and Roquefort than other civic matters its because they do. Only the Boxtrolls are not the agents of mayhem Snatcher tells Cheesebridge. Sure they scavenge from the burg above their subterranean home of gears and gadgets random buttons and toy motors. But it takes scant time in the Boxtrolls company to learn not only are they not thieves they also are most certainly not kidnappers. Quite the contrary The boxy clan of tinkerers nurtures a human gaga-googler who grows up to be a fine 11-year-old by the name of Eggs (voiced by Isaac Hempstead Wright). He looks human but has more in common with the Boxtrolls who raised him starting with Fish (Dee Bradley Baker) and Shoe (Steve Blum). ""The Boxtrolls"" handles its themes of nature-versus-nurture and who is responsible for who you become -- or rather how you act in the world -- with philosophical aplomb. Two of Snatchers henchmen Mr. Pickles (Richard Ayoade) and Mr. Trout (Nick Frost) hilariously ponder matters of free will and whether they are good guys or bad. Working for Archibald Snatcher they are indeed in a moral pickle. As Snatcher slowly succeeds in his plans and the communal cube of Boxtrolls shrinks Eggs must venture into Cheesebridge. When he does he meets Winnie (Elle Fanning) the neglected daughter of town honcho Lord Portley-Rind (Jared Harris). There arent many womenfolk in ""The Boxtrolls."" And we could do worse than this scrappy initially petulant heroine. The performer Madame Frou Frou is not all she seems. There is a nice irony in the fact that theres no putting a stop to the motion in ""The Boxtrolls."" This wildly kinetic movie mixes stop-motion and some computer-generated animation. Add to this the stereoscopic 3-D photography which delivers an immersive realm above and below ground as animators move the puppets or parts bit by painstaking bit. Think of stop-motion -- especially in the dexterous hands of the folks at Oregons LAIKA studio -- as an artisanal undertaking. Craft animation anyone? Its pungent detail-adoring work that partakes in a tradition as old as the cinema itself. Stay for the final credit roll. It has a deep-thinking yet whimsical riff on the art of animation and life -- Cap ""L.""

JOHN SEMLEY Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 26 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 26 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi Written by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava Starring Ben Kingsley Isaac Hempstead-Wright and Elle Fanning Classification PG Country USA Language English The trailer for the upcoming Paddington Bear movie has the anthropomorphic computer-generated cub cramming toothbrushes into each ear rooting around for a bit then removing huge globs of fecal-brown earwax and proceeding to inquisitively lick them. Seen in a cinema full of small children this image of Paddington tasting his own earwax elicited cries of ""Ewwww"" Somehow were at the point where disgusting a child for entertainment is not only acceptable but desirable. My generation - the 20-plus hipster millennial scourge - can probably take the blame. The 1990s were obsessed with this ""gross-out"" mentality from Farrelly Brothers comedies to Tom Green Ren amp; Stimpy and those Bloody Zit frozen slushy drinks marketed by Macs Milk. We were obsessed with anything resembling the muck yuck and waste dripping out of our revolting preadolescent bodies.It was probably only a matter of time before this preoccupation oozed into the mainstream before Paddington Bear would put down the marmalade for the waxy bacterial buildup inside his own ears. We had Robert Munschs Good Families Dont. Now kids have a half-dozen-plus entries in the Walter the Farting Dog series of childrens novels. And the explicit excremental non-obscenity is reflected in reprocessed cultural byproducts such as Shreks snarky mash-up of Disney and the Bros. Grimm and desperate franchise grabs including Disneys Pixars Cars Planes Boats Fire amp; Rescue or whatever all dismal lessons in disposability.So it comes as a substantial relief that The Boxtrolls the latest childrens entertainment isnt some pandering fart-obsessed franchise tent pole. Its a felt funny bracingly sincere kids movie. And even more refreshing it takes as a theme our social fixation with waste salvage and repackaging.The Boxtrolls takes place in an imagined Dickensian borough of Cheesebridge where the upper crust gobble pungent cheeses while down below cave-dwelling trolls - who hide their nudity with pilfered boxes hence ""Boxtrolls""- mill about emerging under cover of night to nip rubbish from the townsfolk. After a small boy is abducted by the Boxtrolls Cheesebridge falls under the tyranny of Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley and one of the most intoxicating onscreen villains in recent memory) an unctuous exterminator who hopes to ingratiate himself amongst Cheesebridges gentry by ridding the town of the Boxtroll blight.In the sewers and hollows beneath Cheesebridge the captured feral child named Eggs (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) believes hes a Boxtroll suffering an adolescent identity crisis after crossing paths with Winnie (Elle Fanning) a young human girl whose fascination with the trolls rumoured sadistic rituals is practically fetishistic. Its when Eggs - who is named after the egg box he has outgrown en route to gangly awkward painfully human adolescence - attempts to integrate with the human world that The Boxtrolls most fully reveals its charms. Making a mockery of their patrician customs Eggs doesnt jive with this world of buttoned-down civility bumbling and self-conscious as he ducks and weaves through one or another social to-do.Just as the titular Boxtrolls learn to remake the world around them (one of garbage clutter and messy excess) so Eggs learns to redesign himself. Likewise The Boxtrolls takes the waste clogging up the core of contemporary culture and refashions it into something of use a story not just of bogus childhood self-affirmation but of upheaval and insurrection. And unlike Pixars Wall-E - another childrens movie dealing with the diligent stewardship of garbage - The Boxtrolls isnt about some conservative return to a bygone Edenic state but about using a cultures existing machinery to fashion something more compassionate; something better.Regrettably the movies painstakingly constructed stop-motion machinery sputters through its last act bogged down by an extended string of action climaxes and diluted somewhat by hammy ""be yourself"" oratory. But the themes of reclaiming and refashioning the detritus of a world grown stuffy and complacent offer warming glimmers of optimism not only for childrens entertainment but for the kids themselves. What better hope for the future generation than for them to manage to make something good of our godawful mess?

There are primal fears (Your parents are going to die and abandon you) There are medieval truisms (Its good to be the princess) And theres some mushy pop psychology (If you just believe in yourself and just be yourself you can do anything) Kids seem to like these movies but then what choice do they have? Theyre taken to them because parents like them and parents like them because they think theyre safe. But what kid really wants to be safe? ""The Boxtrolls"" however is a new cartoon that has a lot more to do with Roald Dahl than with Disney or Dreamworks. It features kidnappings monsters Dickensian henchman and a gruesome nod to Monty Pythons Mr. Creosote. Some parents will find it appalling. I think a lot of children will adore it. Its loosely based on the lively childrens book ""Here Be Monsters"" and perhaps I should go back and all-caps that word ""loosely."" Many of author Alan Snows characters have been jettisoned; the plot has been heavily altered. The boxtrolls themselves have been kept though snaggle-toothed little kleptomaniacs that live underground clothed in cardboard. And some of the books world remains too -- a kind of steampunk English village where the snobs where white hats and swoon over their cheese plates while a troll-terrified populace hides behind their doors. The twist is of course that they have nothing to be terrified of -- theyre all being manipulated led to focus on an imaginary threat to distract from the real villains afoot. Thats a fairly sophisticated point for a childrens story to make but good for ""The Boxtrolls"" for making it. And for making it so entertainingly by having a small boy raised by the trolls helping to make it -- aided by a stamp-her-foot heroine who may be the funniest fussbudget since Lucy Van Pelt. Made by Laika the same company behind ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman"" this stop-motion animated film moves away from the round shiny surfaces of computer cartoons to present something far more real and yes often icky. Teeth jumble together in mouths like old listing tombstones. Flesh puffs up in hives or hangs in sallow folds. Parents may squirm but children I think have stronger stomachs. After all some of them have younger brothers -- or have already sat opposite some classmate who puts french fries up his nose just for laughs. Children like gross. What they dont like is injustice or selfishness (like the village elder here who decides to spend all the towns budget on cheese instead of a childrens hospital). And what they truly love is the chance to seeing an unlovely underdog or two triumph in the end. Aided by a marvelous vocal performance from Ben Kingsley (bringing a slippery Uriah Heep unctuousness to his Cockney villain) and plucky ones by Isaac Hempstead-Wright and Elle Fanning as the young heroes ""The Boxtrolls"" eventually overcomes a slow start to provide some great characters nice style and a rousing finish. There isnt however a Disney-ish message about the wisdom of the aristocracy or the pleasures of being rich. (Or much of a message at all really except that some people can change but most cant.) There are also no Dreamworks-style pop songs no junk-culture references no in-jokes for bored parents no slumming big-celebrity voices. In fact theres little conventional about this movie at all. Thank heavens. Ratings note The film contains violence. The Boxtrolls (PG) Focus (96 min.) Directed by Graham Annable Anthony Stacchi. With the voices of Ben Kingsley Isaac Hempstead-Wright Elle Fanning.

(Laika / Focus Features) Betsy Sharkey Review The Boxtrolls has inventive visuals galore but cant reign in an unwieldy complex story Many intriguing unlovelies are found in ""The Boxtrolls"" a new 3-D animated fable that lifts liberally from the sketches and dark sensibility of Alan Snows creepy-good childrens novel ""Here Be Monsters.""A rich voice cast adds oomph led by a vamping Ben Kingsley as villainous Archibald Snatcher and seductive chanteuse Madame Frou Frou -- amazing what a plunging neckline and lipstick can disguise. He is joined by a feisty Elle Fanning a priggish Jared Harris a conflicted Isaac Hempstead Wright and off-the-wall Simon Pegg along with a mischievous crew of bad bunglers in Tracy Morgan Richard Ayoade and Nick Frost.Exceptional stop-motion animation sends the boxtrolls themselves scurrying through artfully designed piles of debris that litter the Victorian-era village of Cheesebridge. Nearly everyone and everything is in jeopardy -- the trolls the citizens their precious stinky cheese. Such a top-heavy creative slate should deliver a great deal of delight. So why does ""The Boxtrolls"" slip and slide so perilously?Directed by Anthony Stacchi and Graham Annable the stumbling is primarily the result of an unwieldy story that reels wildly around a series of complicated issues. The animation and the plotting vie for attention at times more at odds than Cheesebridge and the trolls. It muddies the most important question hanging over the town like a ripe Limburger Who are the real monsters?

Even so the latest film from Laika the Oregon-animated force behind Oscar animation nominees ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman"" has many charms. That signature off-center orientation and the devotion to outsiders is always welcome in the animation house. And in the current conversation over what makes a family these days boxtrolls make a good case for embracing different.

See more videos The movie is shaped by the complex societies that live above and below ground in Cheesebridge -- people above monsters beneath or so the conventional wisdom goes. Tensions arise when the denizens of the two worlds collide. Irena Brignull and Adam Pavas script is ambitious in its sheer conflict count. Wedged between the exclusive cheese-tasting parties there is a tale of social and economic class divides. Wrapped up in a bow and a party dress is Winnie (Fanning) an ignored and angry child of privilege.In the elaborate civilization down under there is Eggs (Wright) the foundling the boxtrolls have raised since he was a babe. Hes quite happy in his boxtroll life until Winnie points out he is not a boxtroll at all but a boy. Cue identity crisis.Herbert Trubshaw (Pegg) is a mysterious inventor whose revolutionary ideas are considered a threat. He becomes a significant factor in part because hes long been a boxtroll friend. The fear of the monsters is fueled by ignorance.Winnies father Lord Portley-Rind (Harris best known here as ""Mad Mens"" British interloper Lane Pryce) represents the upper tier of Cheesebridges upper crust. Busy hosting elegant cheese soirees for his White Hatted friends he barely has time for his precocious daughter.As vexed as Winnie is nothing compares to the discontent of Archibald Snatcher a man desperate to wear a white hat to smell the cheese.The bulk of the action is tied to his increasingly elaborate schemes to do exactly that -- all involve eliminating Cheesebridges boxtrolls. His trio of Red Hats -- Mr. Pickles (Ayoade) Mr. Gristle (Morgan) and Mr. Trout (Frost) -- are ostensibly there to assist.The boxtrolls are by far the movies most interesting species. Shy creatures of various shapes and sizes they are defined in many ways by the discarded cardboard boxes they use for clothing and hiding. Their names are drawn from the labels stamped on their box which is how Eggs got his.The boxtrolls world is especially inventive with all its recycled sprockets and gears; metal is the only thing they like more than cardboard. In looks the creatures are cut from a mold that is more clever than cute. Typical is Fish (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker who also handles Wheels and Bucket). Eggs surrogate father is an easy-to-love boxtroll with googly eyes a goofy smile a slight drool and a gentle heart.But rather than develop its characters the film expends its energy ginning up spectacular venues to showcase the push-and-pull of the various factions. When Snatcher turns up on stage disguised as Madame Frou Frou the better to manipulate the White Hat society my dear it delivers some Broadway-esque fun -- Kingsleys a hoot as a boa-clad crooner -- but also feels well staged.Its a frustration.You can see the years of effort the polish and precision that went into creating ""The Boxtrolls."" The details are impressive 190 puppets built 79 sets constructed 20000 handmade props 200 costumes 26 locations 56 cameras 892 lights 53000 face parts.... But somehow it still doesnt add up to enough.Follow me on Twitter BetsySharkey -----------------------------------------The BoxtrollsMPAA rating PG for action some peril and mild rude humorRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Column Animation (Movie Genre) Literature Simon Pegg The Boxtrolls Why directors worked in stop-motion The Boxtrolls How directors found the voice characters Ben Kingsley adds his own touch to The Boxtrolls voice role Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-boxtrolls-review-20140926-column.html?track=rss,200,theboxtrolls7,theboxtrolls,latimes

Photo Credit AP / Laika advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The adventures of a human boy raised by underground trolls. Rated PG for scary imagery. BOTTOM LINE Imaginative but very weird more Monty Python than Walt Disney. Not for all tastes. CAST Ben Kingsley Elle Fanning Isaac Hempstead Wright LENGTH 136 Though produced by an American animation studio ""The Boxtrolls"" is about as British as movies get. Its humor is morbid its characters grotesque its story driven by themes of class. Would you believe its a childrens film? ""The Boxtrolls"" loosely based on Alan Snows 2005 novel ""Here Be Monsters"" tells the story of a human boy raised by underground-dwelling boxtrolls -- so called because they wear cardboard boxes the way snails wear shells. Theyre even named after their labels which is why the boy is called Eggs (the voice of Isaac Hempstead Wright) and his adoptive father is Fish (Dee Bradley Baker a voice-work veteran who also plays Shoe and Wheels). Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The boxtrolls are greenish-skinned ugly-cute creatures whose nonsensical babble seems aimed at the international box office. Everything else about this movie however feels unmistakably British. Its setting is provincial Cheesebridge (""A Gouda Place to Live"") ruled by the addle-pated Lord Portly-Rind (Jared Harris). His little daughter Winnie (a very good Elle Fanning) has the ruddy cheeks and pear-shaped figure of a pub matron. The movies villain is Archibald Snatcher an exterminator trying to stamp out the boxtrolls forever. Snatcher is a vivid and rather tragic figure for a childrens film a low-class striver desperate to earn one of the towns ""white hats"" -- a peerage basically. Speaking in a Cockney rumble provided by Ben Kingsley but preening like Tim Curry in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" Snatcher is a cartoon cousin of Dickens Uriah Heep fawning when it serves him vicious when it doesnt. At times he becomes so hideously distorted (hes allergic to cheese) that he resembles one of Ralph Steadmans violent violated caricatures. The movies stop-motion animation (by the Laika company of ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman"") is top-notch but the cheese motif begs comparison to Britains animated ""Wallace and Gromit"" series and theres a gastronomic gag that comes directly from Monty Python (whose Eric Idle contributes a song to the closing credits). ""The Boxtrolls"" has moments of humor and imagination but American children may not be its ideal audience. 242 MoviesThe Boxtrolls trailer PLOT The adventures of a human boy raised by underground trolls advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (scary imagery) CAST Ben Kingsley Elle Fanning Isaac Hempstead Wright LENGTH 136 BOTTOM LINE Imaginative but very weird more Monty Python than Walt Disney.

Boxtrolls thinks outside the traditional animated box review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBoxtrolls thinks outside the traditional animated box reviewThe makers of Coraline and Paranorman are back with another unconventional animated tale for imaginative kids and adults.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Sept. 25 2014The BoxtrollsStarring the voices of Ben Kingsley Elle Fanning Isaac Hempstead Wright. Directed by Graham Anable and Anthony Stacchi. 97 minutes. Opening Friday Sept. 26 in GTA theatres. G.From Laika the animation studio that brought you such memorably quirky classics as Coraline and ParaNorman comes another totally offbeat and original tale for kids (and adults) looking for something a little more challenging and completely off the wall.No there arent any distressed princesses in need of rescue or exaggeratedly fiendish archvillains or budding romance between two young ingenues who initially cant stand each other. Article Continued BelowRather theres a tart and charming story thats short on platitudes although there may be a useful lesson or two burrowed in there.Eggs (voiced by Isaac Hempstead Wright) feels right at home among societys outcasts in The Boxtrolls.The story opens in the precariously (and hilariously) pitched town of Cheesebridge when an infant boy is snatched from his home and disappears beneath the city streets to be raised by the Boxtrolls a race of homely undesirables who wear boxes and are experts at making use of the things the urban dwellers so casually toss away.The infant now a boy approaching teenhood is called Eggs because that happens to be what came in the box he wears in imitation of his fellow underworld denizens whom he regards as his family. Among his companions Fish Shoe Fragile etc.Meanwhile Archibald Snatcher goes on a crusade to track down every single boxtroll in existence in the hope that he can exchange his red hat for the white hat worn by the hoity-toities of Cheesebridge who routinely gather at the home of the high-born Lord Portly-Rind to sample the finest of cheeses.Like most of the characters Snatcher and his coterie of henchmen are cartoonishly grotesque with spindly legs and a more than ample paunch.Even spirited little Winnie the Lords daughter and Eggs are refreshingly un-Disney-like. Shes a little on the chubby side and her face is often unbecomingly pugnacious while Eggs is amusingly spindly with teeth that are wonderfully uneven and unruly hair.Its that deliberate refusal to cleave to conventional notions of beauty (or ugliness for that matter) and the wonderfully hilter-kilter streetscape that makes Boxtrolls so refreshingly original.Theres some standout voice work too especially Ben Kingsley hamming it up as Snatcher and his alter ego the poorly disguised Madame Frou Frou Elle Fanning as the bossy Winnie and Isaac Hempstead Wright as the thoroughly decent Eggs.The dialogue is snappy and witty especially the unexpectedly shrewd observations of Mr. Pickles and the animation throughout etched in lovingly uproarious detail. The 3-D effects though hardly necessary are a nice bonus.Yes there are lessons about the inanity of elitism and even an environmental one (recycle reuse etc.) But Boxtrolls is mostly just plain idiosyncratic fun thats sure to appeal to kids and adults who prefer something livelier and more imaginative than the standard animated fare.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

By NANCY CHURNIN Follow nchurnin nchurnindallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 25 September 2014 0216 PM Updated 25 September 2014 0229 PM Things arent what they seem in animated Laika films like Coraline ParaNorman and now The Boxtrolls where strange worlds leak into ours. A parallel universe of perfect parents is not better than what she had Coraline discovers. Because he can talk to the dead Norman learns to question what hes been taught about witches.In the deliciously detailed stop-motion world of Boxtrolls a ruthless man Snatcher (voiced with wicked glee by Ben Kingsley) stokes fears of the green creatures that dress in boxes and emerge at night in the small 19th-century British town of Cheesebridge. Snatcher convinces everyone that the timid scavengers and talented builders who could rival Despicable Me minions in a cute contest steal and eat human babies.Once he gets everyone worked up Snatcher sets out to rise in his society by becoming the hero who destroys the creatures. He doesnt count on a human baby saved and raised by a boxtroll. As with the human infant raised by elves in Elf the baby called Eggs (after the name on his box) grows up thinking hes just like his adoptive family. But theres a difference in Eggs (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) that transcends his greater height and ability to speak English. Its the courage he shows to fight back and his efforts to teach his friends to be brave too.Very loosely adapted by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava from the Alan Snow book Here Be Monsters plots swirl within plots. Theres a touch of innocent romance when Eggs enlists the help of a skeptical girl named Winnie (Elle Fanning). Theres a running cheese gag thats Wallace-and-Gromitian in its obsessiveness.The clever engaging direction by Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi pokes visual and verbal fun at everyone including themselves. Watch for a vignette in the middle of the credits where Snatchers philosophical henchmen indulge in an existential conversation about their animators.But what makes Boxtrolls truly special is how it challenges kids to consider that the true villain may be the person calling others villains. Laika is carving out a unique place for itself in a crowded and talented animated field with a two-for-two record for Academy Award nominations for best animated films. Boxtrolls could make it three.THE BOXTROLLS (B+)Directed by Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi. PG (action some peril and mild rude humor). 96 min. In wide release.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it From the creators of Coraline comes an animated film about a community of Boxtrolls who are raising an orphaned child in below the streets of Cheesebridge in an underground wonderland. (Focus Features) By Michael OSullivan September 25 2014 The titular protagonists of ""The Boxtrolls"" -- an animated adventure loosely based on the book ""Here Be Monsters"" by British author and illustrator Alan Snow -- are a colony of lumpy gray homunculi who live underground where they build things like their literary cousins the Borrowers out of peoples castoff garbage. Taking their name from the commercial packaging that they wear and live in Boxtrolls resemble nothing so much as nocturnally active vermin running around the streets of England on their hind legs and popping in and out of their cardboard ""shells"" when startled like turtles. Thankfully these are not the Teenage Mutant Ninja variety. The Boxtrolls -- conveniently named things like ""Fish"" ""Shoe"" and ""Fragile"" after the identifying labels on their boxes -- are utterly delightful and original characters brought to vivid antic life in this stop-motion charmer from Laika studios. Yet as winsome as these critters are it is the movies virtuosic animation itself that steals the show dazzling our eyes with its technical artistry and drawing attention away from the films minor flaws which include a somewhat plodding slightly predictable plot. That plot is set in motion by a human boy (voice of Isaac Hempstead Wright) who lives with and considers himself one of the Boxtrolls. On one of his nightly trash-collecting outings Eggs as the boy is called runs into Winnie (Elle Fanning) a human girl from above ground. Soon Eggs begins to question what he is doing in the sewers with a pack of adorably troglodytic scavengers who burble and squeak in a crude Gremlin-like patois while he speaks the Kings English. (How exactly a human boy came to talk like Oliver Twist in this company of pre-verbal brutes is never satisfactorily explained.) The rest of Eggss back story which is hinted at in a prologue suggests there may be some justification to the human characterization of the Boxtrolls as baby-nabbers. As the story proceeds we meet a villain named Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) who has been tasked with the methodical extermination of the Boxtrolls who have been demonized by the human population. With Winnies assistance Eggss mission becomes the rescue of his friends and surrogate family a process that leads naturally to the discovery of his true origins and the rehabilitation of the Boxtroll reputation. The storys moral -- dont put yourself or others in a judgmental box -- is a sweet one and well expressed. Still its not the freshest sentiment in the world is it? Despite that dont be surprised if ""The Boxtrolls"" gets nominated for an Academy Award for best animated film. It certainly deserves consideration on visuals alone. Laikas animators who utilized 3-D printing to generate the roughly 1 1 / 2 million facial expressions for the character of Eggs have outdone their previous work on ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman"" creating a feast for fans of old-school animation art. The story of ""The Boxtrolls"" in lesser hands might have turned out only so-so. Under Laikas loving labor-intensive touch it takes on a kind of magic.    PG. At area theaters.

""Tracks"" is an inspiring story about a sole trek across the Australian desert made in 1977 by Robyn Davidson. David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Do not think outside ""The Boxtrolls."" Instead give yourself over to the movies captivating inventive scary-hilarious world. Jump in feet first just like a Boxtroll entering the sewer system and experience an immensely satisfying all-ages fable packed with plot twists adventure humor nobility wrongdoing bravado creepiness and silliness. The movies crowning achievement above and beyond its awesome achievement in stop-motion animation is how it pulls off the touchy job of modulating these distinct tones into a fully realized whole. It creates and comfortably inhabits its own universe while reaching out thematically to ours. Comfortable in its own skin the movie quotes from all over the place Monty Python Charles Dickens steampunk Tim Burton ""ParaNorman"" (the movie is from Laika Studios which brought us that movie as well as ""Coraline"") even ""E.T."" Theres real brilliance here because tone is everything and so many movies blow it on this score. In the huge towering cone of a city called Cheesebridge life proceeds in a tenuous balance. The effete nobles would rather sniff sample and discuss stinky cheeses than grapple with such dull issues as funding for schools and roads. The populace is held in check with the promulgation of fear about a mysterious common enemy -- the nocturnal Boxtrolls who legend has it feed on babies and live underground among piles of bones and puddles of blood. In fact as the opening reveals the trolls are a harmless society of bug-eyed tinkers hoarders junk stealers and whirligig creators whose primary diet is ladybugs and inchworms. Their name derives from their bodies made from cardboard boxes thrown out by the real world. Boxtrolls express themselves in grunts and squawks and show joy by drumming on their box bodies. They love music dance and play and live in caverns in the citys sewer system. In a side cavern we witness a troll named Fish dote on his adorable single-toothed son Eggs (voiced by Isaac Hempstead-Wright who plays Bran Stark on ""Game of Thrones""). The boy coos with delight when he gets a filthy teddy bear from Dad then promptly rips off the bears head and extracts the tiny music box from inside. Now thats a gift. Feed Loader Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) leads a group of henchmen who are out to eradicate the Boxtrolls. Meantime up top a trio of snaggletoothed henchmen is led by Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley). (This may be the most dentally challenged cast in movie history.) Snatcher vows to eradicate the Boxtrolls in order to claim the coveted white hat signifying all that is respectable and law-abiding. He gets around town in a smoke-belching machine that resembles the love child of a royal carriage and a Transformer. Among myriad delights Snatcher is the movies most indelible creation looking as if an elder Alice Cooper had left his hair unwashed for weeks because he was busy gorging on State Fair food. We learn that there is more to Snatcher than first meets the eye. We also learn Eggs origin story which puts the lad in a ballpark with his wee redheaded love interest Winnifred (Elle Fanning) daughter of the big cheese Lord Portly-Rind. A chase sequence in a giant warehouse unspools alongside a cheese-allergy scene that young viewers will find delightfully gross right up to its therapeutic leeches-centric conclusion. Eggs identity crisis and his growing bravery fuel the films beautifully choreographed finale which is given added texture by deftly handled flashbacks. Dont hide. Be brave. You can change. To thine own self be true. ""The Boxtrolls"" delivers these familiar messages without a hint of lecturing and within a totally absorbing 90 minutes of stop-motion movie magic.

"Animated film The Boxtrolls reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Youll Never Guess Which New Animated Film Needs More Boxtrolls Youll Never Guess Which New Animated Film Needs More Boxtrolls Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 25 2014 155 PM The Boxtrolls Needs more Boxtrolls. By Dana Stevens Theres a reason they call them Boxtrolls. (And a reason they call him Eggs.) Still courtesy of Focus Features. After you watch The Boxtrolls come back and listen to Dana Stevens and Movie Moms Nell Minow discuss the movie in our Spoiler Special. I wanted with every fiber of my being to love The Boxtrolls. The animation studio that made it Portlands Laika stands for everything I value in contemporary animation smart subversive stories that neither condescend to children nor winkingly pander to adults. A commitment to writing female characters who drive the action rather than waiting to get rescued from it. A dedication to craft that extends down to the most minuscule details of production design. (Laikas three features so far--Coraline ParaNorman and now this one--have been done using a combination of old-school stop-motion animation with some drawn animation and CGI.) Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. To my ongoing chagrin my 8-year-old daughter dislikes the theatrical viewing experience but when a movie comes along I know shell love I pull rank and just make her go. I was excited to think that the unimpeachably adorable Boxtrolls--timid blue-gray beasties who wear discarded cardboard boxes like turtle shells--would join the ranks of girl/fish Ponyo Lego man Emmet Brickowski and the minions of Despicable Me all characters she grew to adore despite her reservations. But at the end of this busy but disappointing movie I knew I wouldnt be dragging her out to the theater. Why did the story of this huggable species attempted extinction leave me emotionally indifferent? Advertisement The Boxtrolls problem may have to do with how incidental to the action those lovable blue-gray guys soon become. After a nifty early montage chronicling everyday life in their jury-rigged underground world the trolls become little more than sacrificial goats in their own story useful as hostages or potential victims but rarely (until one too-little-too-late reversal) individuated characters making decisions on their own behalf. Indeed for a long stretch in the films second half nearly the entire Boxtroll population is locked away off-screen while the various human tales are told. If there were actual Boxtrolls hashtag activists would have legitimate cause to launch a Twitter campaign (FeedTheBoxtrolls?) protesting how passive and dependent this movie makes them look. Directed by Anthony Stacchi and Graham Annable The Boxtrolls elevates Laikas dedication to craft even further. Every frame pops with beautiful whimsical design and clever background gags. The feats of stop-motion magic are constant and jaw-dropping and the stereoscopic 3-D (viewed at my screening through fancy battery-powered glasses) looks as crisp bright and un-headache-inducing as any Ive ever seen. But theres just something about this films elaborately allegorical story (based on Alan Snows novel Here Be Monsters) that feels inorganic and contrived. Where Coraline and ParaNorman had stories that flowed directly from the very human plights of their strong title characters The Boxtrolls seems constructed from the top down with abstract ideas rather than people (much less trolls) moving the action forward. The Boxtrolls features what I truly hope will remain the grossest lactose-intolerance-related sight gag of 2014. Ill try to condense the plots many moving parts into one (long) paragraph. In the vaguely Dickensian town of Cheesebridge there are two classes of society the White Hats idle aristocrats who pretend to run the town while actually engaging in lengthy bouts of cheese-tasting and the Red Hats ordinary people who perform the tasks that keep the town running. The most odious of those jobs is the nightly hunting of the Boxtrolls who live underneath Cheesebridge in a cave full of ingeniously repurposed junk from the human world. For reasons that remain hazy (one flaw no one could accuse The Boxtrolls of is an overlong origin story) these gentle nearly nonverbal creatures have long been feared and reviled. Propaganda posters represent them as bone-chomping monsters that if not rounded up each night will eat human children. But the head of the troll-hunting squad the nasty Red Hat Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) seems motivated less by troll-hatred than by status-seeking and greed. Hes got his eyes on a coveted white hat and a place at the table with the cheese-eating elite. Meanwhile Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright) a human boy orphaned as a baby and raised by trolls decides to find out whats happened to his disappeared comrades. He infiltrates the human world to enlist the help of a lonely cosseted White Hat girl named Winifred (Elle Fanning) in putting an end to Cheesebridges nightly troll hunts. The unstructured but frequently very funny script by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava goes to a lot of work to set up this apparent political parable then evinces little interest in exploring its ramifications. How is the stability of Cheesebridges rigid class structure maintained? Are there disaffected would-be revolutionaries among the Red Hat population or only cynical social climbers like Snatcher? The British comics Richard Ayoade and Nick Frost who brilliantly voice Snatchers troll-hunting underlings bring the film as close as it gets to larger social issues defending the morality of their job in ever-less-confident terms. (""Im 60 to 70 percent sure were still the good guys"" pipes Ayoades timorous functionary after yet another unholy deed.) But The Boxtrolls questioning of the good guy/bad guy divide doesnt extend to the characterizations of its actual heroes and villains. The Snatcher as ominously voiced by Kingsley is terrifying without being interesting; his evil is dimensionless without origin or change. And the young human protagonists while slightly more complex (Fanning in particular turns the morbidly troll-obsessed Winifred into an endearing weirdo) are too often tasked with clumsy theme-underlining dialogue about the true meaning of family. With its wild swings between sentimentality and cynicism this overstuffed parable may leave you unsure how to feel about humanity as a whole eager to seek exile among the blessedly quiet trolls. A recurring image in The Boxtrolls is that of a heaping platter of rich smelly cheese the namesake and favored luxury good of Cheesebridge which apparently provides the driving force for much of that city-states class-riven culture. This food is made to seem alternately desirable and disgusting--sometimes both in quick succession as when a character enthusiastically crams his mouth full of cheese samples then spits the whole chewed-up wad out onto a plate. In the last hour the films tonal ambivalence starts to shift markedly in the disgusting direction culminating in what I truly hope will remain the grossest lactose-intolerance-related sight gag of 2014. The Boxtrolls as a whole isnt unlike one of those towering platters of cheese stacked high with lovingly handcrafted delicacies that for some reason leave you feeling faintly queasy. One thing that sets Laika apart from its fellow high-end animation studio Pixar--apart from the dedication to traditional stop-motion technology--is a fascination with the macabre a desire to push into areas of both genre filmmaking and the human psyche that childrens films seldom explore. Coraline and ParaNorman both exist in an odd space where the fairy tale overlaps with the psychological horror film Between the two of them there are plot points involving rigor mortis Puritan witch trials the replacement of parents by evil doubles and the plucking out of childrens eyes. This dark irreverence isnt for every kid (or grown-up) but Laikas confidence that its sensibility will find an audience is part of the studios unique appeal. What ultimately brings down The Boxtrolls isnt the films willingness to wade into grimmer more gruesome waters than your average kids animated adventure. Its the failure to anchor its often misanthropic story in a character or relationship strong enough to offer a glimpse of redemption--a place of respite in an ugly cheese-obsessed world.

"Boxtrolls review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review The Boxtrolls  The Boxtrolls Laika Inc./Focus Features Scene from ""The Boxtrolls."" Scene from ""The Boxtrolls."" (Laika Inc./Focus Features) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Coldly clever the new Laika animated feature strives for a creepy-funny vibe in the vein of ""Coralineamp; Fans of ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman"" the deft eccentric supernatural fairy tales created by Oregon-based Laika animation house have every reason to anticipate ""The Boxtrolls."" Laikas latest feature is based on Alan Snows 2005 book ""Here Be Monsters"" part one of ""The Ratbridge Chronicles."" For the films purposes the mythical hilltop town of Ratbridge has changed its name to Cheesebridge.Something else has changed en route to the screen. ""The Boxtrolls"" remains relentlessly busy up through its final credits and its clever in a nattering way. But its virtually charmless. And theres the matter of villain overexploitation. Pathetically addicted to conflict and cheap sources of dread screenwriters -- even good ones -- often make the mistake of handing their antagonist the lions share of the material allowing the menace to sit on the story in an unhelpful way. Such is the case here with the Boxtroll exterminator Archibald Snatcher voiced by top-billed Ben Kingsley. A mixture of Roald Dahls ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""-derived Child Catcher and a variety of Monty Python grotesques Snatcher runs the show. It is this mans seething class envy guiding the thing; he is a lowly ""red hat"" craving acceptance into the ""white hat"" cadre of snoots running Cheesebridge. (The setting is a steampunk blend of 19th- and 20th-century elements.)Fighting for attention in his own story a human boy named Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright ""Game of Thrones"") has been raised by the marginalized Boxtrolls who live in an underground lair full of fantastical inventions. Eggs so named after the discarded cardboard box he wears like his troll brethren teams up with the mayors daughter Winnie (Elle Fanning) to prove the Boxtrolls right to peaceable coexistence with the human element. Directed by Anthony Stacchi and Graham Annable ""The Boxtrolls"" is one of those movies that looks tantalizing based on its better still photographs if you can get past the indistinctly differentiated trolls themselves. The world created here is one of considerable thought and detail. In execution the style of the animation isnt straight-up old-school stop-motion; rather its a blend of stop-motion hand-drawn and computer-generated images. That third technique I think has a way of lessening the folkloric quality and pushing the results into something I never thought Id say about a Laika movie the usual. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. The voice actors include such aces as Simon Pegg Richard Ayoade and Nick Frost along with Tracy Morgan as a slobbering sniveling Snatcher minion. The gross-out bits such as Snatchers miserable skin reaction to his beloved cheese catch the eye without ever really getting the laughs rolling. Then again the mere mention of the words ""cheese"" ""stop-motion"" and ""animation"" cannot help but conjure the glorious universe of Wallace amp; Gromit the Aardman wonders for the ages.

Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright) a human boy brought up by boxtrolls tries to help save them from the chief exterminators plan in Laikas novel-inspired ""The Boxtrolls."" Photo LAIKA HONS / Associated Press The Boxtrolls review Technically glorious but boxed-in fantasy 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""The Boxtrolls"" is in many ways a beautiful movie and yet in other ways its not very good at all. As an achievement in stop-motion animation its stunning -- seamless and detailed so perfectly done that its easy to forget that youre witnessing skill and not magic. But as a 3-D film its success is qualified and as a story -- as a fantasy that unspools over the course of 100 minutes -- it feels like a throwback to the 1990s. Were left with the frustrating spectacle of great skill locked into a formula thats quite simply unworthy of it. We can be impressed by dazzling visuals and technical brilliance even as we recognize that in a narrative art form those elements are like sauces and garnish. If we dig under the lavish presentation only to find 20-year-old mutton the best we can hope for is that something unwanted can be made reasonably palatable. Thats what we get in ""Boxtrolls."" Alan Snows 544-page illustrated novel ""Here Be Monsters"" has been streamlined into an animated movie about scrappy underdogs going up against a powerful enemy in order to save their civilization. How many times have you seen that and how many times do you want to keep seeing it? If the answer is ""forever"" heres your chance. It is a far cry from ""Coraline"" made by the same studio Laika using the same animation techniques. ""Coraline"" was a breakthrough using animation art in the service of a caustic vision of the modern family. ""Boxtrolls"" by contrast is safe and sentimental and predictable in all ways except its beauty. Set in Great Britain ""Boxtrolls"" tells the story of a severely oppressed minority. Boxtrolls live underground inside cardboard boxes and only come out at night. They are timid very sweet and slightly disgusting. They communicate in grunts and eat anything you might find under a wet cardboard box that has been left outside for a couple of weeks -- centipedes worms caterpillars. Human beings of course are terrified of them and want nothing more than to have them all exterminated. The movie suggests that fear of the boxtrolls is something being used to manipulate the populace. In fact boxtrolls are harmless. This is something the chief boxtrolls exterminator (Ben Kingsley) knows but he doesnt care. He just hopes to use the death of the boxtrolls as his ticket out of the lower classes and into the highest reaches of government. Theres something here that feels like social commentary -- a disconnected ruling class an easily agitated public -- and yet its all both too general and too on-the-nose a calculated statement not an impassioned or inspired one. The boxtrolls exterminator Archibald is drawn so as to look a lot like British character actor Timothy Spall for reasons that arent clear. Elle Fanning voices the role of Winnie the daughter of the richest man in town who teams up with Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright) a human boy raised by boxtrolls in order to set things right. The character writing is typical. Hes earnest and shes the usual bossy smart-mouthed little girl of a kind that will make future generations scratch their heads and wonder how anyone ever found that charming. About two-thirds into ""Boxtrolls"" the story is practically finished but the filmmakers figure out a way to extend it whether the audience likes it or not. One gets the sense that directors Anthony Stacchi and Graham Annable have their hearts in the action sequences and not in the characters and thats a problem. Not a disaster but a point of weakness. One word about the 3-D See it in 2-D. The atmosphere of ""Boxtrolls"" isnt quite steampunk but its grim and murky and to lay a pair of 3-D glasses on top of that makes the image too dark. Two dimensions is just fine. You wont lose much and youll gain a brightened image. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com. The Boxtrolls Animation.

(LAIKA) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 25 2014 139 PM Title The Boxtrolls Film Info Creatures fight against nasty oppression. (136) PG Peril. Area theaters. Kids who get a kick out of the macabre will enjoy this exquisitely crafted but tedious film. Its done in stop-motion and CG by the Laika animation company (""Coraline"" ""ParaNorman""). In Cheesebridge a love of cheese rules but a hatred of trolls who wear boxes runs rampant. The long-ago kidnapping of a baby has not helped the trolls image. The rotund sneaky creep Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) promises to kill every Boxtroll. But the poached baby has grown into a boy who with a ghoulish girl leads the Boxtrolls in a peaceful revolt to stop Snatcher -- while showing Cheesebridge theyre not so stinky after all. The Tim Burton look and Roald Dahl tone add a bit of fun but the unnecessary 3-D makes things murky. Worse is the predictable arc of the story and the familiar gibberish of the Trolls who sound like the minions in ""Despicable Me."" This film skews older than that though and should come with a note to parents Beware here there be dull spots.

Focus Features Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1254 p.m. MST September 25 2014The film directed by Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi and based on the book by Alan Snow takes too long to get started and isnt intriguing enough once it does. Eggs (center) one of the cave-dwelling trash collectors from the animated film ""The Boxtrolls."" (Photo Focus Features )Story HighlightsCritics review 2 starsThe lack of a coherent story is a major problem.The visuals are intriguing but there isnt enough charm.Thats surprising coming from the same studio as ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman.""You have to admire the lengths to which the makers of ""The Boxtrolls"" are willing to go to spring unpleasant surprises on the films audience.Considering that audience will be made up mostly of kids you also have to question their wisdom. Or maybe kids can find a silver lining to a story involving genocide deadbeat parents and self-centered behavior. Kids are weird. (I have four so I feel safe in saying so.)But this much is certain Uninformed parents and their children are going to be caught off-guard and theres not really enough good about the film to make up for that. Which makes the prospect of watching the audience more enticing than the movie itself which is probably not a good thing.MORE azcentral.coms newest movie reviewsPart of the problem with directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchis film based on Alan Snows book ""Here Be Monsters"" is the storys construction. Its set in Cheesebridge where everyone fears the Boxtrolls rumored to be baby snatchers who might just eat off your face if they catch you. So every night the residents of the town bolt themselves behind their doors while the trolls -- who wear boxes thus the name -- pop up from the sewers and swipe everything in sight.The town is run by Lord Portley-Rind (voice of Jared Harris) and his fellow White Hats who are more concerned with cheese than the well-being of the citizenry. Lord Portley-Rinds daughter Winnie (Elle Fanning) occasionally tries to get a little time with her father -- a single parent evidently -- but he is far too concerned with his social status and cheese-eating to pay attention to her.RELATED Top 10 stop-motion animated filmsA scene from the animated film ""The Boxtrolls."" (Photo Focus Features)Enter Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) an exterminator. If he wipes out the Boxtrolls every last one of them Lord Portley-Rind will make him a White Hat.Meanwhile below ground we watch as Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright) a human boy adopted by the Boxtrolls grows up in a nurturing happy environment.MORE 52 Fall films for 2014GET IT? BOXTROLLS GOOD. HUMANS BAD.Just in case you missed anything.The ranks of Eggs troll friends (they get their names from the names on the boxes they wear so he hangs around with Fish Oil Can Shoe etc.) grown thinner as Snatcher increases his efforts.It all ties together eventually but as you can tell its a long time getting there and its an often-bumpy ride. There are some laughs and the dark steam-punk look of Cheesebridge is intriguing but theres little charm. This is surprising as the film comes from Laika Entertainment the studio that gave us the outstanding ""ParaNorman"" and the brilliant ""Coraline."" Both of those films offered challenges for kids in content and execution -- they were legitimately scary (""Coraline"" in particular). But the stories were compelling. ""The Boxtrolls"" meanders too much takes far too long to get started and doesnt pick up enough momentum once it does to keep us enchanted.RELATED 2014 Fall TV Premiere CalendarAnd enchantment is an essential ingredient of an animated film particularly one that skirts dark edges. ""The Boxtrolls"" doesnt have nearly enough of it.Review The Boxtrolls 2 starsDirectors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi.Cast Ben Kingsley Jared Harris and Nick Frost.Rating PG for action some peril and mild rude humor.AZCENTRALThe Boxtrolls (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

VPC Brian Truitt USA TODAY 559 p.m. EDT September 25 2014Eggs is a feral 11-year-old boy who has been raised underground by boxtrolls.(Photo LAIKA/Focus Features)Adults are monsters and cute underground beasts are the good guys in the animated The Boxtrolls.Once you get past Kiddie Fare 101 though the latest stop-motion effort ( out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) from the acclaimed studio Laika is a delectable treat that balances themes of identity and class warfare with Monty Python-style political skewering quirky humor and dairy jokes.The Boxtrolls is set in -- and under -- the steampunky British town of Cheesebridge and introduces its young human hero Eggs (voiced by Isaac Hempstead Wright) as part of a tight clan of mechanically gifted little dudes called Boxtrolls. The boys quasi-dad/best pal Fish along with Shoe Fragile and the rest have lovingly raised him as one of them.USA TODAYMeet The Boxtrolls Whos who underneath CheesebridgeThe surface world is filled with trinkets and doodads for them to steal and use to creative effect but they also court danger. Ever since a baby was stolen years ago in Cheesebridge Boxtrolls are seen as the enemy. That creates an opening for treacherous exterminator extraordinaire Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) to make his move in the citys social circles by vowing to wipe out the Boxtroll problem once and for all.His insanely obsessive goal makes Eggs and whats left of the Boxtroll gang go above ground for help which comes in the form of the curious and puckish girl Winnie (Elle Fanning).The Boxtrolls isnt quite as memorable as Laikas Oscar-nominated movies -- the 2009 fantasy Coraline and the 2012 kid-horror flick ParaNorman. But it shares those films subversive qualities as well as a stunning animation style with highly detailed puppets and a painstaking process that gets an amusing on-screen shout-out before the credits end.Kingsleys hilariously over-the-top cockney accent is as grotesque as Snatchers bulbous belly and stalactite teeth though the character may come off as a little scary for tykes. Co-directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi cast the equally impressive Richard Ayoade as Mr. Pickles one of Snatchers henchmen who begins to think his boss is a few slices short of a cheese wheel.The overall story hinges on Eggs and Winnies oddball pairing and their entertaining relationship sparks when she has to get him ready for a ball and prepare him for a strange environment of human contact.The Boxtrolls hold their own on screen too and children will fall in love with the creatures mischievous antics gurgling language and tendency to use their boxes as both a disguise and a portable bedroom.Each of the clan has personalities brighter than their glowing eyes making this cinematic meal of Fish and Eggs hearty and satisfying. 81 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1peMQZY",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/09/25/the-boxtrolls-movie-review/16133483/,200,theboxtrolls19,theboxtrolls,usatoday

Share Tweet End-credits sequences tend to be pretty inessential ""rewarding"" those who stick around with a few mildly amusing bloopers or a fleeting glimpse of some character to be properly introduced in a later sequel. But The Boxtrolls a new eccentric fairy-tale from the folks behind Coraline and ParaNorman includes a closing button thats worth staying planted for Prompted by the existential musings of Mr. Trout (Nick Frost) a henchman too self-aware for his own good the filmmakers offer a speedy illuminating glimpse at the projects painstaking gestation--the frame-by-frame manipulation thats required of any stop-motion animator. In an age when most cartoon companies have traded pens for pixels the magicians at Laika continue to create fantastically elaborate universes out of pure elbow grease. And seeing them toil away only strengthens ones appreciation for the fruit of their labor the cluttered lived-in environments they build from scratch and the amazingly detailed characters they bring to life one minute movement at a time.An analog player in a digital world Laika is old school in more ways than one Three films in the studio has cultivated a reputation for slightly weirder and wilder family fare--throwbacks to a bygone age when movies for kids were allowed to be a little crass a little scary and a little less concerned about upsetting the delicate sensibilities of the most overprotective parents in attendance. Following the lead Laika set with its last two features The Boxtrolls is a deeply unusual portrait of childhood following an adolescent outsider through a faintly dangerous precisely art-directed storybook world. Foul villains caper menacingly down cobblestone avenues. Lovable monsters stuff their maws with squirming insects. And human bodies already grossly exaggerated bulge with violent allergic reaction. The film is pitched to the screaming id of its young audience while also looking to worm its way through the arteries to the heart.Loosely based on Alan Snows beloved kid-lit novel Here Be Monsters The Boxtrolls takes place in a foggy dingy English town on a hill--a city of buildings on top of buildings as though Victorian-era London had been stretched like an accordion and arranged into vertical stacks. Beneath the streets lives a race of gentle hoarders their home a shantytown built from the discarded bric-a-brac of the world above. These Boxtrolls so called for their use of cardboard boxes as makeshift turtle shells have been smeared as vicious carnivores by the town exterminator a crass schemer named Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley doing his best Timothy Spall impersonation). But Snatchers scare tactics hinge on a trumped-up murder charge The baby the Boxtrolls are said to have dragged below and devoured lives among them as an adopted son now a teenager (Isaac Hempstead Wright) with no memory of his human parents.The plot like the figurines that ""play"" the characters moves a little differently than that of a more traditional animated feature. After a short prologue The Boxtrolls switches to the perspective of its title attractions who speak un-subtitled gibberish; this opening passage set mainly underground and spanning several years may be the most bravely wordless opening act to a family film since WALL-E. The narrative quickly takes a more conventional shape--theres a race against time a dastardly plot to thwart and a budding friendship between Wrights ""Boxboy"" and a young surface-dweller (Elle Fanning)--but the storytelling rhythms remain jagged. And the screenwriters Irena Brignull and Adam Pava plant a reasonably intelligent subtext Snatcher the villain is a desperate social-climber promising to rid the city of the harmless trolls in exchange for the privilege of eating cheese with the aristocrats at the top. One might feel sorry for the guy were it not for his downright genocidal plans--his attempts to improve his own lot by turning the masses against a demonized lower class.The Boxtrolls isnt as moment-for-moment delightful as Coraline which benefited from the twisted imagination of Neil Gaiman and it lacks the emotional depths of the underrated ParaNorman. The hero for one is a little shapeless his personality nearly as unformed as a lump of cold clay. (Its not his fault really--the boy was raised by babbling subterranean scavengers) But every frame of the film is a marvel of creativity and craftsmanship and the filmmakers stuff the margins of their plot with lots of offbeat humor like the goons (Frost and Richard Ayoade) who suspect they may be the films bad guys and the way Fannings character struggles to conceal her morbid curiosity. (Shes almost disappointed to discover that the beasts dont eat babies.) At worst The Boxtrolls could be called a minor effort of its studio. Of course ""lesser Laika"" like lesser Pixar or lesser Ghibli is still head and shoulders above what the competition provides on its best days.

Photo AP MOVIE REVIEW The Boxtrolls Running time 98 minutes. Rated PG (mild peril action mild rude humor). At the Lincoln Square the Empire the Kips Bay others. ""The Boxtrolls"" are adorable grumbly gremlins who collect garbage live underground in cardboard clothing and are widely feared by everyone on the surface. Theyre the twee Victorian forebears of C.H.U.D. Engaging as it is to look at this stop-motion animation film from the young Oregon studio Laika seems to have been masterminded by people thinking ""Everyone loves Pixar. So lets do everything the opposite"" Admirably contrarian. Like being cast overboard and calling out for an anvil. The little monsters live in an underground town built out of scavenged rubbish and the animators have realized this junky paradise with loving detail and a playful sense of wonder. Among the boxtrolls lives a happy human boy whom the others call Eggs after the word printed on his box but rumors that they kidnap children have touched off panic in the gloomy Dickensian city Cheesebridge aboveground. The Red Hats a greasy group of Cockneys led by the villainous Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) have been promised that if they eliminate the boxtrolls theyll be welcomed into the clubby aristocracy of the cheese-loving White Hats and their dandyish leader Lord Portley-Rind (Jared Harris). As I said Pixar this is not. There are no pop-culture references and no jokes to speak of just alliteration and puns nor are the characters lovable or even especially interesting. A source of inspiration seems to be the work of the Aardman stop-motion animation studio behind the Wallace and Gromit films but Wamp;G are much funnier and more charming than anyone here. I do admire this films commitment to full-on Britishness. There are so many scenes of gourmet cheese tasting class snobbery and mass public nudity that it could just as easily have been titled ""A Random Sunday at the University of Cambridge."" Too bad the story is such weak tea Eggs makes friends with Lord Portley-Rinds daughter Winnie (Elle Fanning) who works on de-trollifying him in mildly comedic scenes like the one in which he learns that shaking hands doesnt mean throwing your palms in the air and wiggling them frantically. At the same time the evil Snatcher attends a party dressed in drag (see what I mean about Cambridge?) and Snatchers Red Hat henchmen lurk in the background being neither scary nor funny but simply a bit daft. A lot of kids will be put off by both the creepy faces of many of the characters and the creeping pace of the plot which hums along like a British drizzle until the final act. A couple of mild secrets are revealed to no great effect the henchmen stop being evil simply because theyre asked and the villain fumbles around in a giant Jules Verne-meets-steampunk contraption that probably seemed hilarious in the animation room but on-screen just seems a bit pathetic. You want to give Snatcher directions to the nearest Jiffy Lube and spot him the money for an oil change. Oh and everything culminates in yet another cheese-tasting scene. The characters may obsess over Gorgonzola and Roquefort but dramatically the film has all the impact of Kraft.

These are the boxtrolls uggy creatures of blue skin and Karloffian visage identified by the discarded boxes they wear. (One is called Fish another Shoe a third Fragile.) Hated by the humans above who have been told that boxtrolls eat children -- ""Hide your tender and delicious babies"" -- these bug-eating beasties are actually sweet industrious souls. They chatter like the Despicable Me minions turn the junk they filch from the streets into marvelous gadgets and when its bedtime assemble themselves communally into a neat 16-boxtroll cube. Weirdness with a cutting or cunning edge The Boxtrolls must be and is the latest 3-D feature from Laika the Hillsboro Ore. company specializing in stop-motion animation. After the bizarro-world domestic fantasy of Coraline and the boy-who-talks-to-zombies ParaNorman the new film directed by Anthony Stacchi and Graham Annable lets the Laika animators run rampant and have macabre fun. The ghoulish riot of design channels steampunk architecture Terry Gilliams Monty Python animations Ronald Searle drawings (but more grotesque) Rube Goldbergs crazy-elaborate inventions and any noirish movie based on a Dickens novel. Which is to say that adults can appreciate The Boxtrolls without feeling stupid and kids can enjoy pretending to their parents that theyre scared. For a couple of decades Nick Park and the stop-motion geniuses at Britains Aardman Studio were the undisputed champs of this gruelingly fastidious form of moviemaking in which plasticine puppets on miniature film sets must be adjusted 24 times for every second of film. Parks Wallace amp; Gromit movies and Chicken Run grafted a lovingly sly English wit to this antique technology making Aardman the finest animation studio not called Pixar. But Park has been dormant lately and the last Aardman feature The Pirates Band of Misfits (2012) lacked the old snazz. That gave Laika an opening with its slightly creepier fare. The Boxtrolls has its penny-dreadful moments but its mostly a larkish stroll through a cemetery where the monsters are the good guys. In the screenplay by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava loosely based on Alan Snows childrens book Here Be Monsters Lord Portley-Rind (voiced by Jared Harris) and his fellow burghers of the White Hat club dine on more varieties of moldy solidified milk than are referenced in a Monty Python cheese-shop sketch. Craving admittance to this scamorza and broncha society is one Archibald Snatcher (who looks like a carbuncular caricature of Timothy Spall and sounds like Michael Gambon but is really Ben Kingsley at his most archly villainous). In exchange for a White Hat of his own he promises to rid the town of the scurvy boxtrolls. Snatcher has mysterious malice in mind along with a pathetic disability lactose intolerance. Snatcher summons a posse of neer-do-wells including a pair of arrant philosophizers (Nick Frost and Richard Ayoade) who in the fashion of Tom Stoppards Rosencrantz and Guildenstern muse on whether the boxtrolls ""understand the duality of good and evil."" If they dont the viewers do the boxtrolls are the chronic underclass who have been down so long that they cant see up -- unless they find a hero. That would be Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright who plays Bran Stark on Game of Thrones) a male human raised by the boxtrolls since infancy. He believes he is one of them until he meets Lord Portley-Rinds rebellious daughter Winnie (Elle Fanning). She gives Eggs lessons to pass in polite society but the tutoring doesnt take after kissing a ladys hand he licks it. The movie has its political-parable aspect with malevolent forces convincing both the 1% and the 99% that they have reasons to fear the other. But The Boxtrolls is mainly a delight for the sharp eye and the capricious mind. Why the kids may ask does Snatcher occasionally show up in drag as the ""World Famous Larger Than Life"" Madame Frou-Frou singing anti-boxtroll songs composed by Pythonite Eric Idle? Because he can -- and because the Oregonians who made this movie love all things British and silly. If the Aardman gang has retired from honoring and satirizing English stereotypes then the Laikans will give it a go with love and high spirits. Stick around for the closing credits in which the Frost and Ayoade characters pose the question of whether unseen giants are secretly manipulating their every move. The camera recedes to show Travis Knight Laikas boss and lead animator fiddling in fast motion at moving the characters millimeter by millimeter split second by split second in the ordeal that makes vivacious comic art.

Ben Kingsley is simply great as Archibald Snatcher a noisome ill-bred schemer who dreams of wearing a ceremonial white hat and sitting in the cheese-tasting room with the citys elite. (Who doesnt want a place at the table?) The elite of course want nothing to do with him (not that theyre any better than he is) but they promise him entrance if he can rid the city of its dreaded boxtrolls. You know those nocturnal beasties that stole a baby all those years ago and killed its father. At least thats how the story goes. Wise and witty gross and goofy and only slightly marred by a bit of silliness about self-creation thats contradicted by everything else in the film. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

And that may be no small part of the problem; even with its cockeyed Britishness its gentle messages and technically brilliant use of stop-motion ""The Boxtrolls"" feels entirely too familiar when considered as part and parcel of the Laika output yet another film where a young person caught between the real world and a fantastical one unites the two to save the day ... With a script by Irina Brignull and Adam Pava as adapted from Alan Snows novel ""Here Be Monsters"" ""The Boxtrolls"" takes place in (and under) the city of Cheesebridge a British-ish small town that seems to be half out of kids storybooks and half from Mervyn Peakes terrifying Gormenghast novels a city built on a single hill. The town lives in fear of the title creatures humanoid scavengers scroungers and builders who come out at night to find metal and machines for their own use; wearing discarded cardboard boxes as carapaces like a turtles shell they can pull in all their limbs to hide as just another bit of trash in an urban setting. The boxtrolls themselves are actually loving kind and bumptious creatures even adopting a human boy as their own after his abandonment giving him the name ""Eggs"" in honor of the label on the box he wears like his cohorts.  When local social climber and steampunk mad genius Mr. Archibald Catcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley with a mucus-laden rattle in his speech) promises city ruler Lord Portley-Rind (Jared Harris of ""Mad Men"") he can rid the town of the boxtrolls a frightened citizenry are more than willing to let him firm up his grip on power in the name of safety; Eggs (voiced by Isaac Hempstead Wright) with the help of the cultured proper Winnie Portley-Rind (Elle Fanning) has to figure out how to save his friends and his town. Will your kids dig it? Perhaps and probably more so for its sight gags and busy comedy moments and possibly less for the story as a whole. Theres some excellent voice casting here -- including Nick Frost Richard Ayoade and Tracy Morgan as Catchers self-aware hench-people -- but at the same time all the chases and fights and climaxes feel a little familiar. The dialogue with straining groaners like ""Cheeses hats and boxes dont make you you; you make you you ..."" is so heavy-handed you can feel it slump off the screen in 3-D along with the images. Theres no denying the step-by-step frame-by-frame 3-D-printed magic of the filmmaking is beautiful but this time the process seems to have put the bore in laborious. A lot of ""The Boxtrolls"" is hampered by an ugly look and feel -- crooked teeth leech attacks a man is swollen by his cheese allergies into a pulpy cartoon a villainous character literally farts themselves to death. A little of this goes a long way and while its nice to have something out there as an alternative to the too-smooth look of most computer-animated films Im not sure that the level of grody grit and grime here is the best alternative possibility. Directors Graham Annabel and Anthony Stacchi are both making their feature-length directing debut so the suggestion that they leaned on the Laika house style until it collapsed over on them might be a fair one; a little more story-shaping and editing would not have gone amiss. The most depressing thing about ""The Boxtrolls"" is how its misshapen forest really does contain a few excellent trees; the technique is inarguable even if the ways that technique is expressed are very much up for discussion. The boxtrolls themselves may not speak much but theyre voiced by animation legends like Dee Bradley Baker Steve Blum and Fred Tatasciore.  And theres something about Laikas methods -- with real objects reflecting real light in the grip of gravity itself -- that conveys emotion and feeling in a way that a million meticulous computerized pixels cant. ""The Boxtrolls"" is a swing-and-miss for Laika; when you move forward with revolutionary techniques while standing still in terms of your themes stories and settings no amount of technical trickery or animation genius can bring the boring to vivid life.

Release DateSeptember 26 2014 Full Review Trailer http//www.theboxtrolls.com/ Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - By Amy Nicholson The Boxtrolls is a kiddie charmer that makes you laugh cower and think of Hitler. Thats an unusual trifecta but then again this is an unusual film. If the German Expressionists were skilled at stop-motion animation theyd have already made it. This is cartoon Caligari a fable set on a hillside village crammed with cobblestone streets that look like old photographs of the Frankfort ghetto.The Boxtrolls themselves are monstrous creations one part Nosferatu one part hairless cat. We first spot one sprinting into the sewers with an infant -- more on that boy in a second -- but were meant to love them which for children into grody things is easy to do. The Boxtrolls munch on grubs babble like babies and act like Legos climbing on each other like staircases and at night nesting cardboard flap-to-cardboard flap like a hoarders dream. Ten years ago they took ownership of that human boy (Isaac Hempstead Wright) named him Eggs and have raised him like a Boxtroll. Above ground villainous Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) is using Eggss abduction as an excuse to exterminate the Boxtrolls which the film shows in a hushed devastating montage of their cuddly cardboard cube shrinking night by night. This is a story of propaganda genocide suppression servitude and apathy. Here a self-serving stage actress (also Kingsley) puts on a nasty play about how the Boxtrolls kidnap and kill children and Annable and Stacchi cut to the crowd roaring for vengeance. The Boxtrolls asks questions that the 17 million German soldiers who fought in World War II apparently didnt -- or couldnt -- ask. How wonderful to find a cartoon for children that will.

In the medieval town of Cheesebridge the citizens have been whipped into a panic over the subterranean Boxtrolls little blue-skinned monsters who emerge from the sewers to swipe anything not bolted down. But one boy knows the truth - the Boxtrolls are a kind and cowardly race the victims of a smear campaign by the cruel Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley or more accurately by Don Logan from Sexy Beast). Breathlessly paced and surreally funny The Boxtrolls fizzes with visual invention and wild slapstick. But the grotesquerie is overbearing with its pustulent transvestite villain and mud-spattered aesthetic this is closer in tone to Fellini Python or even John Waters than your average family-friendly blockbuster. By all means take the kids - but dont be surprised if they run screaming halfway through.

Theyre not cute theyre not funny. Theyre neither scary nor special nor even all that original. Ladies and gentlemen theyre ""The Boxtrolls"" and as animated kid-movie characters go these drab cardboard-clad critters are about as compelling as a bunch of pet rocks. Repeating a lot of the same beats from the studios first two stop-motion adventures ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman"" -- a pair of Gothic fantasies in which outcast kids play intermediary between superstitious humans and their supernatural neighbors -- Laikas disappointing latest represents a baffling misappropriation of talent. Hundreds of gifted artists have poured untold hours into bringing to life this relentlessly unappealing script ever so loosely adapted from Alan Snows ""Here Be Monsters"" book series yielding only modestly better B.O. prospects for the company owing more to their reputation than anything this pic delivers. In the tradition of so many other kidlit-to-cartoon adaptations from ""Shrek"" to ""How to Train Your Dragon"" the writers have taken only the thinnest sliver of inspiration from the source material -- in this case the Steampunk city of Ratbridge (rechristened Cheesebridge for the film) and the whimsical species of boxtrolls. As afraid of humans as the humans are of them these reclusive nocturnal creatures live beneath the streets of Cheesebridge mumbling a sort of Ewok-like nonsense language and popping in and out of their boxes like kleptomaniac hermit crabs stealing whatevers left outdoors after dark. One night the boxtrolls take an infant back underground with them and raise him as one of their own. Assumed kidnapped the missing ""Trubshaw Baby"" makes it easy for Archibald Snatcher (who looks like a tubercular Timothy Spall but is voiced by Ben Kingsley) to spread nasty rumors about the boxtrolls and offer his own services for their eradication. Like a sinister Pied Piper of Hamelin Snatcher gleefully launches into his genocidal campaign all with the aim of earning a place among the White Hat-wearing aristocracy led by Lord Portley-Rind (a delightfully distracted Jared Harris) who spend their evenings sitting around eating cheese. Meanwhile growing up underground among the boxtrolls totally oblivious to the fact that hes not really one of them the boy (""Games of Thrones"" Isaac Hempstead Wright) comes be known as ""Eggs"" after the carton that serves as his clothing. (His best friends are Fish and Shoe.) Given the peculiar rules of the parallel universe where the story takes place directors Anthony Stacchi (""Open Season"") and Graham Annable (a videogame and comicbook vet) have a lot of ground to cover in the pics first reel and it doesnt help that its unusually difficult for audiences to figure out the films emotional core from which all else should naturally follow. Judging by Irena Brignull and Adam Pavas script its as if no one at Laika ever had to pitch the project and now that it exists its tough to figure out an entry point. Not until super-late in this inelegantly structured story -- when Cheesebridges only other child character Winnifred Portley-Rind (Elle Fanning) meets Eggs and follows him underground to boxtroll HQ -- do we learn that the whole thing is intended as some sort of commentary on family. Winnie delivers a long speech on what fathers are since Eggs grew up without one and the audience is supposed to recognize that her dads a deadbeat while all these misunderstood monsters have served as a remarkably supportive surrogate clan. So maybe families arent as narrowly defined as societys been telling us (hint hint) which would be a fine moral if the movie didnt immediately bludgeon that lesson with a grotesquely over-the-top finale in which Snatcher unleashes something called the ""Mecha-Drill"" on Cheesebridge sending Dario Marianellis orchestral score into overdrive. Ever since making its feature debut with ""Coraline"" in 2009 Laika has edged its way to the front of the stop-frame game innovating a proprietary face-replacement technology that allows for the most versatile and expressive performances ever seen in the labor-intensive animation technique. (The film features a nifty end-credits joke in which reluctantly evil henchmen voiced by Richard Ayoade and Nick Frost raise existential questions while hands-on Laika topper Travis Knight can be seen animating the exchange.) Before the Portland outfit arrived on the scene Bristol-based Aardman Animation was the undisputed master supplying slightly cruder craftsmanship but a decidedly wacky British wit. With ""The Boxtrolls"" Laika appears to be synthesizing some of the most successful Aardman ingredients -- big lips bad teeth and a cheese-obsessed inventor a la Wallace and Gromit; an elaborate underground world straight out of ""Flushed Away""; plus silly voices courtesy of Simon Pegg and a raft of other U.K. comics -- but without so much as a dash of that studios charm. Here the meticulously crafted world is stunning to behold imagined to the minutest detail and photographed with the sort of dramatic lighting and dynamic camera movement rarely seen in stop-motion. Trouble is its not a place most folks would care to spend any time. Above ground the humans are ruthless American caricatures of ineffectual European dandies while the boxtrolls domain is even less appealing. It features a few nice touches like the way they pack up and stack themselves into a neatly ordered cube to sleep but mostly its a dirty place where vaguely Minion-like creatures eat bugs and live in squalor -- hardly a ""Peter Pan""-like Neverland that Winnie and audiences cant wait to visit and hope never to leave. Trolls can be tricky that way though there are no shortage of the cartoon buggers on the way from the magical support crew seen in last years ""Frozen"" to a pair of upcoming DreamWorks Animation features (Guillermo del Toros ""Trollhunters"" and another pic based on the frizzy-haired Danish toy line). Apart from a couple clever Eric Idle-penned songs ""The Boxtrolls"" doesnt feel especially distinct from Laikas past two films or from other toons in the pipeline begging the question why the team which typically eschews safe marketing-driven bets in favor of more original (and narrowly targeted) offerings didnt abandon this concept and develop another project when they failed to crack the story on this one. Perhaps the creative team simply fell in love with the world of Cheesebridge which presented an entire island city to construct along with a host of distinctive-looking characters as vividly hued as they are oddly shaped. While his cheese-craving motives border on ridiculous Snatcher makes an especially rich villain to animate owing to both his cross-dressing alter ego Madame Frou Frou and the nasty allergic reaction that swells his face in the presence of fromage -- to say nothing of Kingsleys snarlingly over-the-top performance. Compared to the above-ground world with its steep streets and sharp corners seen both by day and night the boxtrolls tunnels and caverns seem rather plain. So do the boxtrolls themselves stumpy gargoyle-like creatures who occasionally charm with their disobedient dog-like antics but lack the memorable personalities of the Seven Dwarfs and other classic cartoon companions. If the idea here was to buy Snows book for these rascals then junk the rest instead of recycling Pixar tricks (during Eggs early bonding montage) and the same preachy anti-prejudice lessons seen in ""ParaNorman"" the Laika team really ought to have thought outside the box.

Yolow TV says November 19 2014 at 945 pm Ive just read the entire comments section of this page its flipping hilarious. Guys stop arguing about whether its going to be good or not or whether homosexuality is acceptable or not (seriously? do we still have to talk about this?). Its a film And films are made for enjoyment Calm down and if you dont want to see it no one is making you. You shouldnt feel the need to comment rudely upon it. Reply beautybaseline says September 27 2014 at 1109 pm I love Laika and was super excited to see this film. But the article is correct the pacing was slow there were no stand out characters aside from the villain and it just lacked heart. Obviously its visually interesting so Ill give it a pass but I hope their next film will be better. Reply Ian says September 18 2014 at 955 pm Nonsense. The screening I went to had 4 rounds of applause. This movie has an eccentric charm Terry Gilliam would be proud to have influenced though ironically the trolls are less interesting than the people in this exquisite world Laika has crafted. Reply M J Dixon says September 6 2014 at 1205 pm Just seen it in preview- and Im sorry but this review is totally spot on. I was so excited to see it loved Paranorman and whilst I can still utterly appreciate the artistry both in the characters and sets (and will buy the Art of book) the film lacked a good script poor storyline some poor voice casting bad pace (very slow at times) and any kind of natural heart. Whilst they picked some of the better elements from the likes of Despicable Me (minions) and Wallace and Gromit / other Aardman features they delivered them badly. I couldnt connect with any of the characters apart from Snatcher the Villain (who was voiced and animated well) - overall a huge disappointment - and I really wanted it to be good. Reply Anamerican N. Venice says September 4 2014 at 709 pm Couldnt disagree more. The film is truly charming the characters vivid and appealing. The story of two children growing up in a society divided by bigotry and hate overcome their own prejudice and topple the evil man responsible. Whats not to love Considering what is going on in the world right now the message couldnt be more relevant. I would agree however with Peters opinion of the art; Beautifully shot gorgeous sets and costume astounding craftsmanship at every turn. Bravo Laika Reply A. Underling says September 4 2014 at 1222 pm This review reads like Red Hat propaganda Reply Touree says August 30 2014 at 1145 pm Great review-I couldnt agree more. The reception at the screening was mild even as the praise for the artistry was high. Its ultimately a drab cartoon that cant figure out who its audience is like all Laika cartoons. Reply tiffany herring says August 30 2014 at 604 pm Hmm.... ive read other reviews and they all say the Boxtrolls was an amazing movie.... im going to see it anyway because it seems like a cute exciting film. I dont care if you think its not very good because thats just your opinion... i Iiked Coraline and I LOVED ParaNorman. Laika studios is my favorite animation studio and im going to see The Boxtrolls. Reply Glenn C. says August 30 2014 at 514 pm Love how they think if they can base it on material that is already somewhat popular that it guarantees them zillions Well it doesnt. But Hollywood just wants to bet on ""sure things"" There are so many original great ideas out there waiting for that chance but they never see the light of day. Typical. Reply towelcigarette? says August 31 2014 at 447 am You couldnt be more wrong. To wit I give you Guardians of the Galaxy. Original and from left field. Biggest movie of 2014. Laika films are creepy and I really want them to succeed but we have Tim Burton and even hes tired. This may be a 1.99 download for me. Reply bobmcdade (bobmcdade) says September 13 2014 at 609 am Guardians Of The Galaxy is unoriginal and totally predictable. Honestly how can you claim it is anything other than utterly derivative. The lead character is Hans Solo crossed with Indiana Jones and so is the plot what plot there is... it is a likeable good-humoured film Ill grant you but not original not any of it. themcclaininator says August 30 2014 at 430 pm This is the most disappointing article I have read in a while. Reply Glenn C. says August 30 2014 at 516 pm It is but it may be the truth. If this reviewer knows what he is seeing and writing about. As we know its all about the script. If the script is bad then....everything else just follows. Reply See All 13 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Divorce Marks Sarah Jessica Parkers Return To HBO But...

Thats followed by two characters who share an existentialist bent -- amusingly voiced by Richard Ayoade and Nick Frost -- imagining a world in which their every movement is manipulated by unseen giants before cameras pan back to show producer and lead animator Travis Knight tinkering away. Those few playful minutes are packed with charm wit and an infectious enthusiasm for the magic of animation -- all qualities that this stubbornly unappealing 3D toon lacks. Like Coraline and ParaNorman before it the film was hatched out of artisanal Oregon-based animation studio Laika where Knight serves as president. And like those earlier features which managed more successfully to juggle dark with light this one appears unafraid to target a more limited audience than most wide-release CG-animated movies. Its demographic seems likely to mirror the 8-14 age range of the source material British childrens author Alan Snows fantasy adventure Here Be Monsters Whether kids unfamiliar with that book and others in the Ratbridge Chronicles series will respond to the films unrelenting cynicism is doubtful. Theres a crucial shortage of heart here from the messy storytelling to the hit-or-miss humor and unattractive visuals. Directed by Anthony Stacchi (Open Season) and first-timer Graham Annable the film was shot with no major dividends in stereoscopic 3D and is predominantly stop-motion with some CG and hand-drawn work. Considered in adult terms its a tale of class envy and attempted genocide in a mountaintop Victorian-era township called Cheesebridge where access to that dairy product in all its most flavorful forms is what separates the rich ""White Hats"" from the poor in red. Down below ground level live the Boxtrolls mischievous nonverbal creatures outfitted in recycled cartons. Each of them takes its name from its packaging Fish Shoe Fragile etc. Irena Brignull and Adam Pavas screenplay perhaps intentionally fudges the intro which explains how the Boxtrolls came to be so hated by the above-ground citizenry and how they came to raise a human boy Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright) since his infancy. This background is outlined more clearly later on but that doesnt exactly facilitate early plot access. Limited compensation comes in our initial exposure to the happy Boxtroll community who travel by conveyor belt in their underground lair eating bugs and stacking themselves into a neat cube when its time to rest. A race of builders as opposed to the idle folk up above they also make regular forays into the town proper after nightly curfew to forage for whatever useful junk they can get their hands on. However once introduced the Boxtrolls dont actually do much. Having successfully spread the falsehood that Boxtrolls eat children social-climbing ""Red Hat"" Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) has vowed to exterminate the vermin believing their demise is his ticket to the civic leaders cheese-tasting table. He roars in his wagon along the cobblestone streets at night with his henchmen crying ""Hide your cheese Hide your tender and delicious babies"" With each nighttime excursion a few more Boxtrolls are captured and believed killed and as their numbers dwindle Eggs begins to fear for their survival. But during one trip above ground he meets fellow 11-year-old Winnie (Elle Fanning) the neglected daughter of snooty Lord Portley-Rind (Jared Harris) leader of the White Hat elite. The girls morbid fixation with Boxtrolls gives way to solidarity upon closer acquaintance and she becomes an ally as Snatcher grows ever more ruthless. Theres no shortage of plot here and yet somehow the film never gathers much steam shuffling from one busy set-piece to the next without fostering investment in characters good or bad. While Dario Marianellis robust score spells drama and action even the requisite roller-coasteresque chase scenes fail to build excitement. And the more dialogue-driven moments are often sluggish and dull particularly when the writers start underlining their themes about how loving families come in many forms and how packaging matters less than whats inside. The death blow to any residual affection the film has managed to hang on to comes in the climactic stretch during which the now-crazed Snatcher unleashes a mammoth contraption thats like a steampunk transformer robot stomping all over town causing panic and mayhem. This ugly imagery is a far cry from the quaint Edward Gorey-style Victoriana of the illustrations that accompanied Snows novel. In fact the dreary-looking storybook hamlet has little that could be called distinctive. The work of the voice cast is fine but rarely interesting enough to bust out from behind the artists lackluster character designs. Kingsleys Snatcher is a particularly joyless villain not least of all when hes grotesquely bloated from cheese intolerance. Actors like Toni Collette Tracy Morgan and Simon Pegg are wasted; the most entertaining contributions come from Ayoade and Frost as Snatchers incongruously cerebral sidekicks. Questioning the notion of heroism and the lines separating the righteous from wrongdoers they wonder if Boxtrolls ""understand the duality of good and evil."" The saddest misstep here is that while the kind industrious Boxtrolls are the downtrodden of the story they are also treated as such by the screenwriters. Their fate becomes entirely secondary to Snatchers lust for position and wealth to Eggs friendship with plucky Winnie and to the boys reunion with a lost figure from his past. And frankly when there are trolls in peril in the mix who cares about all that other stuff?

A surprisingly charmless and aimless movie from Laika Studios the upstart stop-motion artists who previously crafted the wonderfully dark ""Coraline"" and ""Paranorman"" this latest venture seems destined to disturb young viewers while thoroughly boring their parents. Lacking appealing characters (or character design) this misfire will with any luck eventually become a forgotten footnote among the output of a production company that has up until now shown real promise at making films that defy the usual tropes and storytelling mechanisms in contemporary family-friendly animation. See video Elle Fannings Winnie Hatches Plan to Save Eggs From Ben Kingleys Evil Snatcher in Boxtrolls Trailer (Video) Based loosely on the childrens book ""Here Be Monsters"" by Alan Snow ""The Boxtrolls"" takes place in Cheesebridge where the news that the underground-dwelling Boxtrolls have stolen a child leads evil exterminator Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) to offer to kill all of the little creatures in exchange for being allowed to join the citys elite White Hats. (That groups leader Lord Portley-Rind (Jared Harris) is far more concerned about the title characters getting their hands on his stocks of Gouda and Brie than he is about the welfare of the local citizenry.) That child as we come to learn wasnt stolen (for reasons explained well into the story) and he grows up among the kind and peaceful Boxtrolls to whom he is known as Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright). (All the Boxtrolls bear names that match the labels on their boxes so theyre called things like Fish and Shoe.) As Snatcher keeps sweeping up Boxtrolls and decimating their population Eggs sneaks out in the daylight during the annual celebration day that has sprung up to mark the anniversary of his supposed abduction. While the garish Madame Frou Frou sings an epic ballad about how the Boxtrolls kidnapped and then ate the child Eggs comes face to face with Winnie (Elle Fanning) Lord Portley-Rinds ignored daughter. (Her bossiness and self-determination cross over into being grating and obnoxious; I wanted an animated Lou Grant to pop out and tell her ""I hate spunk"") As Eggs and Winnie discover the true nature of Snatchers terrible scheme -- one that frankly doesnt even make much sense while the film is unspooling let alone after some post-screening analysis -- they must rally the kind docile Boxtrolls to stand up for themselves and fight back. Much like the underground Boxtroll kingdom where humanitys discarded bits and springs and junk get repurposed the screenplay by Irena Brignuli and Adam Pava feels like a messy and awkward amalgamation of ideas and plots from previous better movies. Apart from Fish (Dee Bradley Baker) who becomes Eggs surrogate father the Boxtrolls are singularly lacking in personality or individuality. We dont get to know them very well we never find out what their relationship to humans (with one exception) was like prior to Snatchers reign of terror and we certainly never find out how Eggs learns to speak like other humans. Also read Coraline Producer to Adapt Decemberist Colin Meloys Wildwood There are some scattered laughs to be found most of them involving Snatchers philosophical henchmen Mr. Pickles (Richard Ayoade) and Mr. Trout (Nick Frost) but they disappear for long stretches at a time. (Theres one particularly funny gag involving a rim-shot; in another movie it would be but a passing amusement but here it stands aloft like the Mount Olympus of Comedy.) Also read Ben Kingsley to Star in Spike TVs Tut Worst of all ""The Boxtrolls"" operates in a realm of ugliness; the little beasties arent interesting to look at the humans are grotesque and the sets lean toward the grimly industrial the mechanical hodgepodge or the blandly storybook-village approach.
