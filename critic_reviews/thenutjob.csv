Set in a generic 1950s American suburbia it glances towards adult appeal by tasking Surly and his furry compadres with a raid on a nut shop which is being used by a criminal gang aiming to tunnel into a nearby bank. The filmmakers dont work the heist-movie parody too hard since pretty much everything in this South Korean co-production is slightly undercooked lacking the same degree of sprightly wit or dramatic punch regularly found in A-list studio product. Still grown-ups will pick up on how the film encourages scepticism towards the motives of our self-proclaimed leaders (in this instance Liam Neesons pompous alpha-racoon). Arnetts frisky protagonist isnt as likeable as he thinks he is but Maya Rudolphs delicious voicing of Precious the crooks high-spirited mascot pug proves a reliable scene-stealer. Adequate for a wet afternoon.

"Those Hollywood Dumpuary Blues << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The Last Skate Atelier  Next A Visit From the Goon Squad Facebook Twitter Print Movies Those Hollywood Dumpuary Blues One great doc cant stop the fall of Monuments Men or the cynicism of The Lego Movie by Wesley Morris on February 7 2014 Theres an audience for The Monuments Men. Its a WWII drama in which George Clooney assembles a team of curators historians and museum directors turns them into soldiers and devises a plan to stop the Nazis from stealing Europes great art. Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman and Bob Balaban play the art experts. So do Jean Dujardin of The Artist and Hugh Bonneville of Downton Abbey. Cate Blanchett makes long faces as a Parisian conscripted into doing clerical work for the SS. Clooney directed and cowrote this movie with his creative partner Grant Heslov. (Its based on a real years-long mission -- the Monuments Fine Arts and Archives program -- that Robert M. Edsel documented in a pair of books about purloined treasure during the war.) Clooney applies an unflagging chumminess to nearly every scene. Its the war film his astronaut from Gravity would have made. The camaraderie is played for gentle laughs. The score by Alexandre Desplat imitates the music in old Hollywood battle pictures -- woodwinds pip brasses gleam tubas fart. When Clooneys character Frank Stokes a dashing conservator delivers a speech about the crux of the operation -- to save the soul of civilization -- a piano twinkles behind him. The whole movie has an unbearable lightness. As I said theres an audience for this movie. But that audience lives in 1964. That might strike some moviegoers as complimentary. It might flatter Clooney too. Hes directed five films. This one is the spiritual twin of his 2008 football screwball Leatherheads -- both strive to embody bygone entertainment just not artisanally. These arent vintage re-creations the way youd get with a younger director who just discovered say The Dirty Dozen. Theyre not the explosive revisions of Quentin Tarantino either. With Clooney these throwbacks arent out to unpack antique craftsmanship or correct long-standing thematic problems. With him its The Dirty Dozen with even less dirt. The film spans more than two years from the winter of 1943 to the spring of 1945. Yet whenever a new time card stamps the screen youre forced to ask where all those months went. Because descriptive filmmaking doesnt come easily to Clooney the characters actually have to explain everything. The men make their way around Europe in search of a couple of key pieces including Michelangelos Madonna of Bruges. But Clooney doesnt attach to the art any personal meaning or wonder. That sort of melodrama is beside the point to him. Or maybe its been forced to seem beside the point. I cant think of another movie that feels as simultaneously rushed and leisurely. There are three good sequences -- one in a clearing with Goodman Dujardin and a horse; another with Murray and Balaban experiencing a stroke of luck in a farmhouse; the third puts one of the men on a land mine. The first two could have been elevated to greatness with some patience just playing out the rhythm to enrich the suspense. That third sequence is perfect as it is yet by the time it happens all the jolliness and sense of moral purpose have drained the movie of real tension. The Monuments Men feels like the intersection of The Good German and the three Oceans capers all of which Steven Soderbergh directed all of which feature Clooney. This is a film that could have used a little of Soderberghs chilliness to cut the mirth. Warren Beatty is the actor who produces and directs to whom Clooney has often been compared. Theyre both liberals whose movies veer between politics and old-Hollywood fluff -- two of Clooneys other dramas were about Edward R. Murrow and a juicy presidential campaign. But Beattys grip on a genre was sure enough for him to riff on it. I think Clooney sees filmmaking as an opportunity to wag his finger -- at philistines at the past at the present. Theres some subversion in that approach. Entertainment runs a distant second to point making. He seemed to know that the campaign movie of his The Ides of March from 2011 was trash. The trash is what some of us wanted but he was ultimately too tasteful to dignify our lust. He tried to shame politics and us. Thats the frustration with Clooney. His father Nick is a journalist film historian and politician. As a director Clooney flatters his father who plays an older version of Stokes briefly toward the end. The apples still hanging on the tree. Its not for nothing that Clooney has cast himself as the conservator in The Monuments Men. Hes making the sort of movie no one makes anymore. Hes the keeper of several flames. But in doing so hes thinking past the audience and into Senate hearings and Festschrifts. Hes rigorously wow-averse. His films dramatize the distance between confidence and certitude and how the latter denies any possibility of true levity or surprise. The Murrow movie 2005s Good Night and Good Luck worked more or less because its moralizing came from the mouth of a moralist. It was resonant ventriloquism. Still you never exit a George Clooney film satisfied that youve watched a movie. You go home feeling like youve just signed a petition. The Monuments Men had been placed on last years holiday schedule and was moved off the Hollywood version of benching a star player. Seeing it now you understand why. Sometimes a perfectly competent film simply doesnt come together in that alchemical way that a merely good movie needs to. Nothing blooms. This is the historical movie I think people feared Ben Afflecks Argo would be fine scenes that dont add up. Part of the enthusiasm for the film had to do with the surprise (and relief) that Affleck whos really the modern Beatty had pulled it off. Something bloomed. Thats a cosmic-industrial reason for how The Monuments Men has been handled. Theres also the simple reality that Clooney and Heslov have misguided the movie to almost ideological ends. This is essentially an action-adventure film. But Clooney plays it as a tract. Once again hes appealing to our better selves with a work of classicism. But the trouble with his ideas of the classics is that they dont feel as if hes learning anything. Hes lecturing. The Monuments Men actually opens and closes with Clooney behind a lectern pointing to images on a screen. That captures the George Clooney moviegoing experience. Leave the popcorn. Bring a notebook.  It seems almost unfair to open a WWII trifle like The Monuments Men which is careful to graze the particulars of the Holocaust in the same week a new Claude Lanzmann documentary arrives. But The Last of the Unjust has begun making its way around the country with its nearly four-hour running time; outrageously compelling subject Benjamin Murmelstein; and tour de force discourse. Murmelstein was an Austrian Jew forced by Adolf Eichmann into the terrible assignment of helping run the Theresienstadt Ghetto. In 1975 Lanzmann met with Murmelstein for a series of interviews that went mostly unused for his Holocaust landmark Shoah. The nest of moral and ethical questions raised by Murmelsteins role at the camp warrants the full Lanzmann treatment. I wrote about the film last spring and my feelings about it havent changed. It still has an inexorable force. Murmelstein meanwhile proves a vexing encryption of a man even to a master prosecutor like Lanzmann. The central debates about culpability and betrayal are riveting wearing and finally depressing. Clooneys movie searches ruins looking for art. Lanzmanns art arises from scouring adjacent atrocity in pursuit of answers. His documentary doesnt deserve an audience so much as demand one.  When does an animated family movie have to surrender to the realities of family entertainment? Can it be too cool for its own good? I thought about that while watching The Lego Movie. By family standards it is first an epic of sorts. The films been made to seem as if it were built entirely of Lego blocks and pieces. The simulation mixes computer animation a kind of stop-motion and what appears to be the painstaking manual labor of working with actual Legos. And the effects occasionally produce magic -- like whenever water and suds run they gush as tiny Lego bricks. Often though the simulation just seems well simulated. But the film itself has the archness of something aimed at people predisposed to despise a smart fitfully earnest movie like Frozen. Cynicism drives The Lego Movie. It focuses on a himbo construction worker named Emmet (Chris Pratt) whos mistaken as a savior akin to Neo in The Matrix. Emmets dragged all over Lego Land by a questing punk named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and a holy Moses called Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) just like the ancient Roman architect. Theyre joined by a split-personality Hello Kitty-like cat (Alison Brie) a goofball spaceman (Charlie Day) and a pirate (Nick Offerman) operating what could be a Jaeger from Pacific Rim. Theyre all trying to stop an egomaniacal CEO from taking over the world. Hes a suit on stilts called President Business. His voice belongs to Will Ferrell and the red tie and wooden manner would seem to belong to Mitt Romney. His henchman is another dual personality played by Liam Neeson. They all move with the blockish gracelessness you expect from a Lego figurine. The directors are Phil Lord and Christopher Miller the pair responsible for the shocking hilarity of the 21 Jump Street movie. I laughed at this movie too. Freeman and Neeson find their respective self-parody sweet spots and the whole thing is almost stolen by a narcissistic Batman played by Will Arnett with his voice scraping the earth. But I got tired of laughing which never happened with 21 Jump Street. It wasnt the idea of a studio raiding its vault for satire (most of the fictional references Ive mentioned are Warner Bros. properties even loosely Hello Kitty). It wasnt the idea that the movie is just a commercial for Legos though I did think seriously more than once about how fun it might be to build myself a city some weekend. I stopped laughing because after 20 minutes Id had enough. The conceit gets stale fast. If Michel Gondrys all-Lego music video for the White Stripes ""Fell in Love With a Girl"" had lasted 100 minutes the tidal wave of joy you get from that clip would dissipate and all you would be is wet. Id had enough of the cynicism too. The movie wants to mock adventure movies and cartoons and disrespect family movies with ""whatever dude"" cool Emmet is an almost self-admitted idiot whos happier being a drone. You sense that Lord and Miller want to make another piece of gonzo vulgarity something ironically riotously lewd like Trey Parker and Matt Stones all-marionette Team America World Police. But The Lego Movie is as far as the studio would allow them to go. Any real anarchy actually feels suppressed. So you doubt its sincerity. Once the film breaks into a long would-be climactic live-action interlude with Ferrell as a neglectful dad I threw my hands up. Emmet tells Wyldstyle ""I never have any ideas."" Lord and Miller run out of fresh ones fast.  It does of course feel churlish to complain about an animated movie this physically ambitious and fun (while it lasts) when something as dreary and heartless as The Nut Job is out there. This movie purports to be a caper adventure featuring park rodents trying to steal sacks of nuts from human gangsters. The whole thing looks like a video game youd rather not play. There are poor nut puns an idiot bulldog and two heists that take too long to execute. Theres also a curiously erotic moment in which the hero -- a sour selfish squirrel (Arnett again) -- stops pushing away his mute rat friend and makes unexplained eye contact with him for several long seconds. Some other characters break up the moment and the squirrel pushes the rat out of the frame. Thats not even subtext. I saw The Nut Job with a 5-year-old whos newly obsessed with giving his food and movies star ratings. He spent the walk home wondering aloud why the gangsters were shooting guns and why the movie ended with a cartoon Psy doing ""Gangnam Style"" over the closing credits. For a child that is the musical equivalent of putting bacon on a manure sandwich. ""Two stars"" cried my 5-year-old friend. How this movie happened at all is far more perplexing than the failure of Clooneys movie. With animated childrens entertainment weve reached a point at which quality might not matter at all. If you can keep the price tag down (The Nut Job has already grossed more than its reported 42 million budget) theres money to be made no matter how junky and derivative it is. Even the voice work is miserable. Neeson villainous again joins Arnett and a miscast Katherine Heigl. Arnett and Neeson sound as if theyre having the time of their lives in The Lego Movie. Here they sound like they want to hide. They should.

Ltd./ToonBox Entertainment Way more fun than its mid-January release date would have you believe The Nut Job is a delightfully goofy slapstick cartoon with a surprisingly dark heart. A noirish heist flick about a group of hungry animals attempting to rob a nut store in an effort to stockpile food for winter its the kind of movie whose surface frivolity masks all sorts of interesting things going on underneath. Plus its got a bizarre Psy cameo so theres that. Heroes in childrens films often start out flawed -- the better to learn the obligatory life lessons -- but its rare to find one whos an outright jerk. Even Gru from the Despicable Me films usually confines his villainy to poetic feats like stealing the moon. But ""jerk"" is a good way to describe the aptly named Surly Squirrel (voiced by the aptly cast Will Arnett). Hes not a haunted loner or a misunderstood outcast or even a neer-do-well dreamer. When we meet him hes planning to rob a nut vendors cart; he doesnt want to do the honest work of gathering nuts for the winter nor does he want to help out his fellow animals. Why the hell should he? Hes smarter and has more vision than the other parkland beasts. Less the Road Warrior and more Ayn Randian egoist Surly doesnt think he needs anybody elses help to survive. Certainly not the small collective of animals led by the seemingly wise grave Raccoon (voiced by Liam Neeson). Its no skin off Surlys back that everyone else is about to starve owing to a less-than-impressive nut haul for the winter. If you think there might be a crude dig at socialism here youre right and as the film proceeds it becomes more and more overt -- like Rififi meets Animal Farm. Surlys eventual transformation into an upstanding cooperative member of the community is a foregone conclusion. But the fact that the film chooses to make him the attention of our focus in the first place gives the story an added kick and brings The Nut Job closer to the crime films it playfully apes. After being banished from the park and then being chased by a gang of rats Surly lands smack against the front of Maurys Nut Store. The shop itself is being used by a group of human thieves to dig a tunnel into the bank across the street. So as the mobsters plot to rob the bank Surly and a small cohort plot to rob the store itself. Its a neat idea -- an extended montage that intercuts the animals and the people planning their respective heists recalls Fritz Langs M and the way it intercut between the cops and the underworld -- and it makes the films criminal milieu more than just a stylistic touchpoint. The gangster genre is one of the few accepted ways that American artists can make ""bad people"" their protagonists. (Consider the recent outrage over The Wolf of Wall Streets so-called glorifying of financial malfeasance from many folks who didnt bat an eye over Goodfellas affectionate portrait of murderers.) The Nut Job slyly adopts that stance. This is a movie about animals (and people) out for themselves. And its funny in a rough but bracing way. The slapstick is surprisingly violent though not threatening It reminded me how much animation has moved away from the pile-of-bricks-landing-on-a-characters-head style of Bugs Bunny and Road Runner. Theres no weight to anything here and if youre looking for a genuine escalating sense of danger youre looking in the wrong place. The Nut Job is replete with flattenings explosions electrocutions and all sorts of other physical humor. Its dumb brutal funny stuff embracing the chaotic irresponsible spirit of its protagonist. It might not be particularly smart or subtle but it feels like the most genuinely mischievous kids movie in years.

Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 17 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 17 2014 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Peter Lepeniotis Written by Lorne Cameron Peter Lepeniotis and Daniel Woo Starring the voices of Will Arnett Liam Neeson and Brendan Fraser Classification PG Country USA Language English The most famous squirrel in the Western canon is of course Rocket (Rocky) J. who along with his trusty partner Bullwinkle J. Moose kept the American flag flying high in the bitterly chilly winds of the Cold War.Fifty years later The Nut Job indicates that the dream of the Great Society is dead and that its every squirrel for himself; as the film opens the strangely purple-hued Surly (Will Arnett) is scheming to rob a chestnut vendor and keep the spoils for himself instead of sharing with the other famished furries in his immediate vicinity. The conflict between the individual and the larger group is the most pertinent theme of The Nut Job a possibly unprecedented co-production between Canada the United States and South Korea that employs the latter nations most popular K-Pop export - the Gangnam-Styling Psy - to top off its soundtrack. This is surely a pandering gesture but in lieu of the lavish animation budgets and top-tier voice actors available to CGI comedies produced under the Pixar banner its perfectly understandable; in a crowded commercial marketplace you gotta have a gimmick.There are stretches wherein the plucky underdog vibe of The Nut Job makes it more likeable than the sum of its mismatched parts. The parallel plot lines about Surlys attempt to infiltrate a dry-goods store that is in turn being used as the base of operations for a gang of wannabe bank robbers are awkwardly integrated and parents may be a little miffed to see so many scenes in which the bad guys casually draw guns to deal with their vermin problems. And yet theres something endearingly grave about Surlys predicament. Exiled from his stomping grounds at the order of a despotic raccoon (Liam Neeson chomping down on his dialogue like so many cashew nuts) he gives off a bristling freelance-samurai sort of vibe (one of the best jokes is the one that introduces him warily gazing across the city skyline from an elevated perch just like Batman).Co-writer-director Peter Lepeniotis deserves credit for eliding the usual deluge of pop-culture references that have drowned so many post-Shrek family entertainment. Its also nice that the voice actors from such Hollywood hands as Brendan Fraser and Katherine Heigl to Canadian performers such as Sarah Gadon and Annick Obonsawin attempt to inhabit their characters instead of riffing off of their star personnas. Arnett whose work on Arrested Development involved stylizing himself into a kind of live-action cartoon gives Surly the gruff harsh cadences of a 1970s-style antihero and if its a bit of a one-note performance it does its part to ground a film thats otherwise rather erratic.Advances in computer animation over the past few years have been such that oftentimes genuinely superb design and staging gets taken for granted. It also means that its easier to spot a dud and The Nut Job spends the majority of its time in the uncanny valley between photo-realism and stylization. Only a multilevel chase sequence involving Surly and some glowing-eyed street rats has any real kinetic excitement and the supporting characters lack visual distinction (although Racoons stone-faced avian sidekick is pretty amusing).As an independently produced alternative to studio behemoths The Nut Job has a certain lo-fi charm but its hardly a world-beater; with all due respect to Surly Rocky J. Squirrels place in the pantheon would seem to be safe for another 50 years.Special to The Globe and Mail Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Credit Open Road Films Opens on Friday.Directed by Peter Lepeniotis1 hour 26 minutes""The Nut Job"" is a Canadian-South Korean animated feature set in the American 1950s urban world of film noir. ""Holy Toledo"" and ""burn rubber"" are some of the old-time phrases uttered by characters including a gang of human criminals trying to rob a bank and a group of squirrels attempting a heist of a nut store.Will Arnett and Katherine Heigl provide voices for characters that will be familiar to those who know the actors live-action work. Mr. Arnett plays Surly the squirrel a self-serving loner banished from the park at the urging of an evil raccoon leader (Liam Neeson). And Ms. Heigl is Surlys love interest Andie who has no remarkable characteristics of her own.Much more interesting are Surlys mute best friend Buddy a dimwitted but loyal rat and Precious a kooky pug whose androgynous voice is not immediately recognizable as Maya Rudolphs.Ms. Rudolph is by far the best thing in the film. Almost any scene with Buddy or Precious is funny and oddly emotional. Otherwise ""The Nut Job"" features muddy-colored and often ugly animation a plot that feels too stretched out and loaded with details to hold the attention of most children and more flatulence jokes than anyone deserves.""The Nut Job"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild action and rude humor.

Scott Bowles USA TODAY 926 p.m. EST January 18 2014The animated tale is uneven has undeveloped characters and resorts to bad jokes.Surly voiced by Will Arnett scores a payload in The Nut Job.(Photo Open Road Films)Story HighlightsUSA Today Review  1/2 out of fourStars Will Arnett Liam Neeson Katherine Heigl Brendan FraserRated PG; Runtime 1 hour 26 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideRemember when animation was a solid entertainment bet?It wasnt that long ago that Pixar and Shrek ruled the cartoon landscape and animated features faced a formidable bar of palette and storytelling.No more. As the rueful The Nut Job ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) underscores animation has joined comic books and horror as genres so profitable that theyve been drained as if they held crude oil. For every solid performer such as Oscar nominee Frozen to hit screens it seems fans must wade through slapdash fare such as Nut Job.TRAILER The Nut JobREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYCOMING SOON The latest trailersDespite some high-caliber voice talent and shimmering animation its hard to get a bead on this tale about a curmudgeonly squirrel racing with his parkland pals to find enough food for winter.The story is simple enough but even the backdrop lacks consistency The human world from vehicles to outfits suggests a 1950s setting. But with Nuts hipster sarcasm video-game aesthetic and thumping versions of Gangnam Style on the soundtrack the movie is an overt play for kids with cash.Will Arnett voices Surly a rebel rodent who sees the pending winter as problematic because food has grown scarce. His solution jack the mother lode of snack food -- Maurys Nut Store.Director Peter Lepeniotis a former animator who worked on Toy Story 2 muddles the story further by overlaying a needless plot about a bank robbery as humans and varmints vie for their treasures.The problem begins with the voices. As 30 Rock beautifully demonstrated Arnett has a timbre tailor-made for villainy. And hes great at sarcasm. But as a hero hes not so convincing. Katherine Heigl who voices resourceful Andie cant get beyond bland either. Liam Neeson does a better job as Raccoon the leader of the animal crew though his character is about as threadbare as the script.Which is Nut Jobs true weakness. When the story gets stale the movie inserts a ""nuts"" pun or worse resorts to a gas or burp joke. It doesnt work the first time nor the fifth.Worse news for parents Theres little in the way of subtle cleverness for adults. The action is frenetic and the jokes are geared for 8-year-olds on a sugar and caffeine high. And in case the kids miss the message -- that teamwork is better than selfishness -- Nut Job lectures the point before credits roll.Nut Job is pretty to look at though the 3-D is pointless. And at least the message is sanitized for families in desperate need of 90 minutes to kill.But to spend much on this would be well you know ... 12 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1dVeYex",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/01/16/nut-job-review/4504435/,200,thenutjob7,thenutjob,usatoday

Toonbox Entertainment Ltd. hide caption toggle caption Toonbox Entertainment Ltd. The Nut Job Director Peter Lepeniotis Genre Comedy/Family Running Time 86 minutes Rated PG With Will Arnett Katherine Heigl Brendan Fraser Liam Neeson Given the feel-good themes of the average kids movie -- be yourself follow the golden rule love each other blah blah blah -- its refreshing to see an animated comedy chuck that guck and focus on a real jerk. Not a misunderstood Princess Elsa or a Wreck-It Ralph with a heart of gold but an out-and-out two-bit sell-you-down-the-river-if-it-would-save-his-own-fur shyster. The sour (and strangely purple) squirrel at the center of The Nut Job is appropriately named Surly in fact. Hes a pariah among the diverse woodland creatures living in the refuge of a small park in the middle of the busy metropolis of Oakton. And unlike your diligent everyday squirrel busily storing up food for the winter Surly -- voiced by Arrested Developments Will Arnett as a mix of hard-bitten loner and slick wise guy -- lives by his wits from score to score with no help from anyone else unless you count the bumbling assistance of Buddy his rat sidekick. (And its clear that even Surly doesnt really count him.) Buddys adoration of Surly of course and Surlys tolerance for the goofy rat are there to telegraph that hey under that squirrels prickly exterior hes actually a good guy. And for The Nut Job to get to the heartwarming place it must Surly surely cant stay selfish to the end right? Still to the movies credit it keeps its antiheros motives anything but altruistic for quite a while. YouTube When his scheme to hit a nearby street vendor and take him for all the nuts in his cart collides with the plans of Andie (voiced by Katherine Heigl) and Grayson (voiced by Brendan Fraser) -- two squirrels sent by the rest of the animals to pull off the same theft on behalf of the larger critter community -- Surly refuses to share anything. Of course his machinations lead to a spectacularly choreographed catastrophe that destroys even the inadequate food supply the park residents have managed to um squirrel away. The communitys commanding leader a raccoon voiced by Liam Neeson calls a vote and Surly is banished to the unforgiving city. For all its genuine exploration of the costs and benefits of the individuals relationship with the collective -- and later the true nature of heroism -- The Nut Job is basically a comedy for kids an acorn-in-a-slingshot picture that targets the lowest common denominator and hits hard. There are bad puns about nuts (almost none of which work) music choices that are both anachronistic (its set in the 1930s) and instantly dated (""Gangnam Style""?) and rote gags involving animals who easily survive electrocution or brickbats; the latter serve mostly to complicate the stakes which elsewhere are literally life and death. Where the movie finds its paws is in its old-fashioned heist plot kicked off when Surly discovers the ultimate score in a store that sells nuts and only nuts -- a shop thats also the scene coincidentally of another robbery-in-the-making this one involving humans using the sites basement to dig through to an adjacent bank. Once Surly and Buddy case the joint develop a plan and deal with the inevitable surprises The Nut Job could be any classic caper flick. Theres the standard motley crew of conspirators here comprised of squirrels gophers a rat a mole and a pug -- owned by the human leading the bank job -- who just wants to get in on the fun. Theres excitement over the risk and the potential reward a betrayal or two and some legitimately thrilling set pieces as the complications in both heists add up. Of course theres the stirring question posed to the once-independent con artist when his heart begins to soften -- does he take the loot all for himself or help the community? If youre able to forgive the movies occasionally nutty (and groan-worthy) jokes it delivers an interesting and satisfying answer.

(AP) By Stephanie Merry January 16 2014 Follow stephmerry A surly squirrel named Surly and his best buddy Buddy the mute rat plan a heist to steal cashews peanuts and almonds in ""The Nut Job."" In other words cleverness is in short supply in this animated feature. But at least its a 90-minute reprieve from hearing the kids sing ""Let it Go"" from ""Frozen."" Antiheroes are the protagonists du jour and Surly (voiced by Will Arnett) has many of the familiar flaws. The selfish scurrier has no interest in helping the other creatures in Liberty Park where he lives even though he has a mind for schemes and his neighbors are going into starvation mode. After his plan to steal a nut cart goes awry and the park dwellers stockpile goes up in flames Surly is banished and forced to live in the city. Its a scary proposition though Buddy tags along. There the pair stumble onto as Surly calls it ""the lost city of Nutlantis"" or Maurys Nut Shop. The store is a front for bank-robbing mobsters but is indeed filled with nuts and Surly and Buddy begin plotting a raid. Meanwhile Liberty Parks resident do-gooder a squirrel named Andie (Katherine Heigl) negotiates her way onto the break-in crew although her ultimate goal is saving the park residents while Surly per usual cares only about No. 1. ""The Nut Job"" is set in the mid-20th century and there are some mildly amusing reminders of the era from mobsters who call women dames to a dame with the film-noirish name of Lana. Some of the action also harkens to another time with sight gags and heavy use of pratfalls more reminiscent of ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons than recent animated features. Sometimes the punch lines land and sometimes they dont but overall the result is pleasantly nostalgic. In fact the most dated part of the movie is when the final credits roll to the tune of ""Gangnam Style"" sung by an animated Psy. That feeling of been-there-done-that is pervasive with many of the jokes sounding like they were ripped off from other movies. When brainless park hero Grayson (Brendan Fraser) says his cologne is made of falcon tears it sounds like a bit from ""Anchorman"" only less amusing. The brightest moments come courtesy of a pug named Precious (Maya Rudolph) who is at first a menace to Surly and Buddy but soon becomes their adorable accomplice. Visually ""The Nut Job"" is more successful. When Surly first moves to the city we see the world from his vantage point with each pounding foot looking like an object of destruction. And the moment the parks food goes up in flames inside an oak tree looks spectacular and makes the 3-D worth it (but only momentarily). Of all the flaws of ""The Nut Job"" Surlys grouchy attitude is one of the hardest to overcome. Hes not a very fun character to travel with even when he evolves predictably into a kinder gentler squirrel with an after-school-special-worthy lesson to share. There are never enough kid-friendly movies it seems so Surly and his plot will suffice. But when you compare ""The Nut Job"" to the growing list of childrens movies that also delight adults its hard to go back to the way things were.   PG. At area theaters.

"Review The Nut Job 3-D animated movie doesnt quite crack it - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review The Nut Job 3-D animated movie doesnt quite crack it The Nut Job Toonbox Entertainment Surly (voiced by Will Arnett) and Precious the Pug (voiced by Maya Rudolph) in the movie ""The Nut Job."" Surly (voiced by Will Arnett) and Precious the Pug (voiced by Maya Rudolph) in the movie ""The Nut Job."" (Toonbox Entertainment) Annlee Ellingson Winter is coming to Oakton the fictional city circa 1959 at the center of the new 3-D animated film ""The Nut Job."" Unfortunately the critters who occupy Liberty Park havent been able to store enough food to survive the season. Thats of no concern to the aptly named Surly (Will Arnett) a purplish squirrel who looks out for only himself.When Surly discovers a stash of snacks in a closed nut shop he makes a deal with peacekeeper Andie (Katherine Heigl) to share the loot with the rest of the park. Trouble is a gang of thieves plans to use the nuts in a heist of the bank next door. BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenBased on a 2005 short by director Peter Lepeniotis ""The Nut Job"" features decent CG animation especially of animals but the writing isnt particularly clever relying on obvious puns and slapstick humor. Moreover in a bid to raise the stakes the plot consists of double-crosses upon double-crosses upon double-crosses that kids may not be able to follow. By far the nuttiest element is the inexplicable incorporation of an animated version of Korean pop star Psy leading a closing-credits curtain call to ""Gangnam Style."" Because of the tunes association with pistachios after last years Super Bowl ad? More likely because several executive producers are themselves Korean. In any case its a dated and bizarre coda to an otherwise stale snack.""The Nut Job."" MPAA rating PG for mild action and rude humor. Running time 1 hour 26 minutes. In general release.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com The Nut Job Share Comment Theres potential in the premise of a heist movie featuring 3-D animated park critters angling to get their paws on a cashew and peanut stash. Not that youd expect ""The Nut Job"" to be ""Oceans Eleven"" in cartoon (or cartoonier) form. And no the film doesnt inspire complete ticket-buying confidence with its modest creative pedigree - routine cast journeyman-animator director obscure Korean production outfit - or its way-late reliance on ""Gangnam Style"" naturally to hype it all.

Photo Toonbox Entertainment Open Road Films Nut Job review A mix of the crude and the noir-ish 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Nut Job Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Will Arnett Katherine Heigl Maya Rudolph and Stephen Lang. Directed by Peter Lepeniotis. (PG. 86 minutes.) ""The Nut Job"" is a nice compromise for small children who are too young for ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" but still want to see a movie whose lead character has almost no redeeming qualities. The new animated movie also takes place close to the ""Llewyn"" 1961 time frame and theres a musical number but the comparisons end there. The musical number is set to ""Gangnam Style."" ""The Nut Job"" is forgettably mediocre but its not atrocious and that represents a small victory during this January dumping ground for kid movies. Bodily-function jokes abound and theres an overreliance on violent slapstick to get laughs. Nevertheless someone cared enough to give a movie about a squirrel that handles dynamite some subtle noir-ish qualities. The little things matter when your kid has zero cinematic taste and still wants to go to the movies every other week. Our hero is a squirrel named Surly whose complicated schemes threaten a community of nut-gathering critters that live in a park. A foodstuff-related disaster leads to banishment from the community. And before you can say ""How is this any different from A Bugs Life?"" he must form an eclectic group of allies to make things right. The films best quality is the much-more-original parallel story Surly and friends are scheming to rob a big-city nut store which is also the safe house for a crew of late 1950s gangsters who want to rob a nearby bank. Their goals intersect in clever ways much of it involving a pug (voiced by Maya Rudolph) that plays both sides. ""The Nut Job"" was written and directed by Peter Lepeniotis whose source material is his own 2005 animated short ""Surly Squirrel."" Even at just 86 minutes the attempt to stretch out the material is apparent. There are too many supporting characters and action scenes go on and on to near-Peter Jackson/""The Hobbit"" proportions. Voiced by Will Arnett Surly is less sympathetic than most childrens movie protagonists but thats a relief. His antihero attitude blends nicely with the noir-ish dialogue which is already in contrast with the unusually bright and sun-kissed visuals. Overall the movie looks pretty good in 3-D considering the bargain budget by mainstream animated film standards. Someone spent a lot of time making the architecture and production design match the era. Grandparents getting dragged to ""The Nut Job"" will be appreciative. Liam Neeson is once again a capable-sounding authority figure as the park groups leader. Even playing an animated raccoon you get the impression Neeson could battle a pack of wolves and still have time to take down an Albanian human trafficking ring.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An outlaw squirrel knocks over a local nut store. Rated PG (rude humor) BOTTOM LINE An animated heist flick? Brilliant idea but the off-key result is a kiddie noir with hard-bitten dialogue and blasts of flatulence. CAST Will Arnett Katherine Heigl Brendan Fraser LENGTH 126 ""Im looking out for No. 1"" says Surly the antihero of ""The Nut Job."" Hes part of a long tradition of cinematic outsiders from William Holden in ""Stalag 17"" to Robert Mitchum in ""Out of the Past."" Surly is tough and extremely cynical -- especially for a purple squirrel. ""The Nut Job"" is itself a strange animal an animated kids movie inspired by the film noirs of the 1940s and 50s. Its also set in that era judging from the round-topped sedans and the backdrop is Oakton a New Yorkish city centered on Liberty Park. Surly (the voice of Will Arnett) is the parks outlier who wont help the critters socialist czar Raccoon (Liam Neeson) gather collective stores for winter. Instead Surly wants to knock over Maurys Nut Shop. Unfortunately its the headquarters of a bank-robbing ring led by fresh-from-the-slammer King (Stephen Lang). Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""The Nut Job"" could have been a squirrelly version of ""Oceans Eleven"" It has a love interest Andie (Katherine Heigl) and a chauvinist buffoon Grayson (Brendan Fraser) but the similarities end there. As Surlys heist progresses the mood darkens with betrayals sabotage near-drownings and a bit of rough justice. ""Ill never talk"" shrieks a traitorous varmint squirming under the glare of a street lamp. The overall mood resembles a furry nut-based version of Stanley Kubricks ""The Killing."" How did that happen? Perhaps director Peter Lepeniotis and his co-writer Lorne Cameron (""Ratatouille"") modeled their movie so closely on classic Hollywood crime flicks that they accidentally made one. The logistics of the twin heists are highly detailed the double-crosses complex and the characters awfully hard-boiled. Surly is so committed to his loners creed that we half-expect him to clasp Andie in his arms and shoot her. The movies climax unexpectedly intense includes a police barricade a plummeting vehicle and even a moment of goodbye-to-all-that anguish. Whenever the movie does remember its young audience it aims low inserting blasts of flatulence feeble jokes (""Youre nuts"") or cuing up the goony dance-track ""Gangnam Style"" by South Korean rapper Psy whose native country provided financing. For all that ""The Nut Job"" may be too tough for most kids to crack. 140 MoviesThe Nut Job trailer PLOT An outlaw squirrel knocks over a local nut store. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (rude humor) CAST Will Arnett Katherine Heigl Brendan Fraser LENGTH 126 BOTTOM LINE An animated heist flick?

By MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The Nut JobStarring Will Arnett Brendan Fraser Liam Neeson Katherine Heigl Stephen Lang Directed by Peter Lepeniotis Rated PG for mild action and rude humor Running time 1 hour 25 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times for 3D version and standard version)The quick hitA maladroit cartoon about an alienated squirrel who will turn off adult audiences and leave children wondering whether theyre supposed to hate him or like him. Grade D Science suggests that living close to cities enlarges the brainpower of small nimble mammals like squirrels. Unfortunately judging by ""The Nut Job"" working with these tiny urban creatures reduces the intelligence of filmmakers. This grotesquely wrongheaded cartoon centers on a charmless selfish squirrel named Surly (Will Arnett). Near the start the animal community of a city park banish him to the streets. With the help of his scruffy rat buddy Buddy (Rob Tinkler) and his bland love interest Andie (Katherine Heigl) he must learn to change his motto from ""life is for the taking"" to ""life is for the sharing."" Believe it or not director Peter Lepeniotis (who cowrote the script with Lorne Cameron) tries to make Surly the rodent equivalent of say William Holden in ""Stalag 17."" Surly may be a shrewd greedy hardhead but hes more of a straight shooter than his self-righteous superior Raccoon (Liam Neeson) a mock-Churchillian figure who controls the whole parks food supply. Lepeniotis lacks the storytelling and comedic skills to pull off the shifts in audience sympathy this setup requires. And he drops all the balls as he tries to juggle the dual plots of Surly breaking into a nut store and mobsters using that store as part of their plan for a bank heist. ""The Nut Job"" falls back on literally flatulent jokes and a succession of noisy slapstick chases. Neesons Raccoon and Maya Rudolph as a pliable pug named Precious enliven the sound track with their vocal mischief. But the only time the animation made me laugh was from a group portrait of some crazy-eyed pigeons. These goofy scavengers - ""rats with wings"" - all too briefly steal the show from the all too dull cartoon rodents.

"The Nut Job movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW The Nut Job  The Nut Job Open Road Films Scene from ""The Nut Job."" Scene from ""The Nut Job."" (Open Road Films) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Mighty oaks from little acorns grow and all that but ""The Nut Job"" didnt work out that way. This 3-D animation job a co-production of South Koreas Redrover Co. and the Canadian outfit ToonBox Entertainment generates such little interest in the fates of its urban park critters you may find yourself pondering mixed-use development schemes to rid the film of its key setting altogether.Director and co-writer Peter Lepeniotis movie comes from ""Surly Squirrel"" an animated short the filmmaker made nearly a decade ago. It wasnt much to look at and wasnt funny either and in that film the titular rodent was an unrepentant punk. A revised ultimately redeemed version of the same squirrel returns to take the lead in ""The Nut Job"" this time voiced by Will Arnett.The generic computer animation locates the story in a vague 1940s/early 50s universe of big boxy automobiles underworld gangland figures and phone calls that cost a nickel. There are two narrative lines that crisscross. One follows Surly as hes banished from the parks threatened animal kingdom (Liam Neeson voices the raccoon leader) and to get back in the parks good graces his scheme to steal a winters worth of food from a nut shop located suspiciously closely to a bank. Storyline No. 2 hews to the human world and a plan to rob that bank.How the two tales intertwine becomes the main point of theoretical interest in ""The Nut Job."" Other rodents come with the voices of Katherine Heigl (as Andie the conflicted love interest for Surly) and as a preening rival of Surlys Brendan Fraser. Stephen Lang growls his way through the role of the chief human thug.Big problem straight off tone. The violence isnt slapsticky; its just violent. Another problem Since Surly even the new redeemable model spends so much of the story being a flaming jerk ""The Nut Job"" fights its protagonists own charmlessness from the first scene. Turning a dislikable leading character a little less dislikable by the end credits sets an awfully low bar for this sort of thing.Because a lot of the financing came from South Korea over the end credits the unlikely pop star Psy pops up in computer-animated form to reprise ""Gangnam Style"" one more time. The script by Lorne Cameron and Lepeniotis pays lip service to the notion of community and family. But Surly is only that -- surly -- and ""The Nut Job"" feels not like an adventure not like a job but simply like a cynical expansion of an idea that barely worked at 11 minutes. Kids deserve better. Even squirrels deserve better.mjphillipstribune.com""The Nut Job"" - One starMPAA rating PG (for mild action and rude humor)Running time 126Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Animation (Movie Genre) Entertainment Movies Katherine Heigl Endangered Species Environmental Issues Liam Neeson Latest movie reviews REVIEW Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit  REVIEW Ride Along  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-nut-job-review-0117-20140116,0,2573091.column",200,thenutjob15,thenutjob,chicagotribune

(AP Photo/Open Road Films) Kids loves stories about dogs and/or cats and good animation can help them appreciate non-domesticated critters too. Early in the production the creators of ""The Nut Job"" might have hoped that their movie would do for squirrels what ""Ratatouille"" did for rodents but this dead-on-arrival toon is some of the worst p.r. for rodents since bubonic plague hit medieval Europe.The rot radiates outward from the main character. A squirrel named Surly (annoyingly voiced by Will Arnett) lives in a park in a mid-century metropolis called Oakton. While the raccoons rats and possums have worked out a system for sharing their meager food resources Surly is a greedy glutton. When he accidentally incinerates the animals winter rations Surly is voted out of the community and forced to survive alone on the mean streets of the city. Yet unlike his pitiable kinsman Scrat in the ""Ice Age"" this varmint easily stumbles upon a pot of gold -- or rather of golden nuts at an Oakton snack shop. The fact that the shop is a front for the mobsters who are trying to tunnel into the bank across the street is another noncomplication and their bulldog guard (Maya Rudolph) turns out to be a pussy cat.Although theres a sort-of romance involving a sympathetic squirrel (Katherine Heigl) a weak subplot involving a furry would-be hero (Brendan Fraser) and a head-scratching twist involving a regal raccoon (Liam Neeson) the co-writers have no sense of structural rhythm let alone humor. They serve us a handful of fart and poop jokes and plenty of puns involving the word ""nut"" but theres no real wit that would jeopardize the movies obvious ambition to appeal to tots overseas. (Its a Canadian-Korean co-production with an animated cameo by the Seoul sensation Psy.) On the plus side the burnished backgrounds are pleasant to look at but finding something to savor in the story is a tough nut to crack.What ""The Nut Job""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 126  Content Some mild peril and rude humor Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

BY Jordan Hoffman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday January 16 2014 1226 PM The Nut Job -- 2 stars With the voices of Will Arnett Katherine Heigl Liam Neeson. Park rodents scheme to steal food from corrupt humans (126). PG. 3-D where available. Area theaters. The woodchucks squirrels and voles of this heist picture live somewhere between George Orwells ""Animal Farm"" and a lost episode of ""Tom amp; Jerry."" Surprisingly beneath the bonks to the head and flatulence gags theres not a bad story here -- and plenty of political subtext. ""The Nut Job"" is about a corrupt raccoon (voiced by Liam Neeson) who manipulates food supplies and maintains fear to wield power. A maverick squirrel (Will Arnett) ostracized from the community for being too independent ends up working with a righteous lady squirrel (Katherine Heigl) to save the day. Their target a nut store which is also a front operation for film-noir-style human bank robbers. Focused mostly on one location the cartoon is stuffed with exhausting visual mayhem. Some jokes land but most kids over 10 will roll their eyes. (Maya Rudolphs turn as a dopey pooch is an unpredictable highlight.) Unfortunately mice and moles dancing jubilantly to ""Gangnam Style"" would have worked better a year ago. Making topical but timeless family fare is a tough nut to crack. Menashe Nov and Lior Ashkenazi in Big Bad Wolves Big Bad Wolves -- 4 stars Revenge and vigilantism Israeli-style (150). Not rated Violence. In Hebrew with subtitles. Sunshine. Israeli directors Aharon Keshales and Navot Papushado take a classic ethical debate and turn it into a dark -- and darkly funny -- thriller which Quentin Tarantino named the best film of 2013. Despite having no concrete evidence a police detective (Lior Ashkenazi) knows in his gut that a mild-mannered teacher is a child-killer. Just as the investigators about to go vigilante the father of a victim pops up and the plan changes. The bulk of ""Wolves"" is a volley of sympathies set in a creepy basement interrupted by overbearing mothers and gallows humor. The Middle Eastern setting adds a rich quality and the movie works as both a suspense flick and a vehicle to examine the ethics of justice. Some scenes get gruesome without warning but the violence is always earned. Masaharu Fukuyama (l.) and Keita Ninomiya in Like Father Like Son Like Father Like Son -- 3 stars Families discover their young sons were switched at birth (202). NR. In Japanese with subtitles. Lincoln Plaza IFC . The nature-versus-nurture debate gets thoughtful consideration in this Japanese jury prize winner from 2013s Cannes Film Festival. A posh put-together young couple in Tokyo are startled to learn their only child a well-mannered 6-year-old boy is not theirs. A mixup at the hospital switched deliveries with another family. Those parents who have older and younger kids are a little rough around the edges with a home thats rowdy but loving. Hospital psychologists agree that an ""exchange"" must happen soon -- if it is to happen at all. There are no clear villains just four parents struggling to figure out how best to proceed. While some of the class conflict is predictable the movie wins out by treating everyone as individuals not types and maintaining a muted tone. The child performances are stellar though most striking is how the films sympathies spread to everyone.

Its an era of wondrous entertainment options; plentiful art abounds and were never truly at a lack for awesomeness. Which in a way makes you all the more grateful once you see a film like ""The Nut Job"" a movie so lusciously horrible that it cant but help you reflect on all the better times youve had times that include almost anything really from taking out the garbage to learning how to do your own taxes. Yes ""The Nut Job"" perhaps more than any animation of the past few years inspires a sense of palpable wonder and chagrin - your mind will rattle with awed thoughts like ""how in the world did anyone think this was a real movie / script / idea / thing?"" Its just relentlessly awful. The story of ""The Nut Job"" is handled with all the care and concern of microwaving a burrito at 3 A.M. after seven straight hours of a pub crawl. Theres some pawing at blurry objects cries for help and hunger so much hunger for anything worthwhile to happen that would somehow turn this death spiral into a worthy narrative. Theres a squirrel named ""Surly"" (voiced by Will Arnett) who only looks out for himself and never the entire park of animals. How do we know this? Because the movie shows and tells us about two dozen times in the first five minutes. ""That Surly"" youll often hear a tertiary character mumble ""sure does only look out for himself like a selfish squirrel never caring a whit for the needs to the park"". I mean just that his parents even named him Surly feels like some sort of cosmic set-up for youd be hard pressed to find a genial and affable member of the rodentia order who was also named you know Surly. Still thats not even on the top 100 of idiotic things on display here so lets just move on to the idea that winter is coming and both the park and selfish Surly have designs on robbing a food cart thats selling nuts right outside the park borders. This feels reasonable and if you can create a great childrens story from a talking parrot (""Rio"") or a friendly dragon (""How to Train Your Dragon"") then you sure as heck can work with a bunch of squirrels (and groundhogs and a raccoon) who want to rob a nut cart. Unfortunately and quite inexplicably another plot is woven in one where humans are planning to rob a bank across the street from the park and theyre using the nut cart and nut shop (from whence it came) as cover. This on the face of it is clearly stupid but if you dig even deeper its also stupid in that way as well. Why would a childrens movie need a bank-robbing subplot? Surly runs afoul of the local park magistrate a raccoon cleverly named Raccoon (and voiced by Liam Neeson) which leads to his banishment from the gentle confines of the park. Now I know what youre thinking ""Why does Surly the squirrel get a real name while Raccoon is named after what he is a raccoon?"" Theres simply no telling. Perhaps Raccoons parents were cruel and thought it would be hilarious to name him after what he was. Even crazier this pattern is only repeated once more with Mole (Jeff Dunham) while the other squirrels rock monikers like Grayson Andie and Precious. Within the implications of capricious decisions like these theres probably a way for us to find the reason for all human apathy but weve still got to move on to the actual problems of the film which amazingly we havent broached. No the real deal issues with ""The Nut Job"" include the appalling lack of anything resembling comedy or ambition. Oh there are jokes where people fart and jokes where people are thrown into windows at top speed making their face all flat but there is no real inspiration to any of it and the scenarios Ive presented happen again and again with no awareness that multiplying a non-joke doesnt lead to a laugh. There are also logic problems and these arent nitpicky because they defy the logic of the films own reality. For instance of course we have to accept talking animals and guys that use nut carts as bank robbing cover thats the films inherent stability but what about the fact that a giant tree burns down in the middle of the park and no human notices? ""The Nut Job"" establishes that the police exist because they pester the robbers upon occasion and we know people exist in this world because you know banks and robbing. But no one walks through the park and no one is at all concerned with a giant tree burning down smack dab in the middle of everything. At some point the song ""Gangnam Style"" is introduced apropos of nothing at all and squirrels will be electrocuted with no consequences and shot at to no effect. A man will be able to hear a dog whistle. There is also the not so troublesome aspect of foreshadowing major moves within the film although wed need a new word something stronger even than telegraphing a word that would encapsulate the filmmakers here basically holding up a sign to any audience saying ""Do you think this might come up again?"" Surly the squirrel looks out for himself. Might this come up again? Raccoon banishes Surly without a trial could Raccoon the raccoon not be all that benign a ruler? Andie (Katherine Heigl) thinks Surly has so much more potential than hes showing and that he could be a huge help to the park food storage crew though strangely enough Surly decides to move to Hollywood and become a dancer.  Additionally Surly is awful simply awful and thats another issue with ""The Nut Job"" you hate this guy with the passion of a thousand suns. Hes mean to his friends and co-conspirators alike hes the sort of squirrel youd never allow to marry your son or daughter. Id level the advice just to avoid all adjective-named rodents with a negative connotation but for all I know theres a pretty good dude out there going by the name of ""churlish"". You never can tell. Overall ""The Nut Job"" is precisely the sort of movie thats released in the sleepy days of January buried among the award-chasers and slow wintery weekends. Its a miserable time at the movies and if you choose to go youll feel as though youre lost at sea with no help of rescue only 15 minutes in. Boring poorly thought out and simple to the point of being the cinematic equivalent of a zero note opera ""The Nut Job"" is a childrens movie youd have to be a little crazy to enjoy.. See? There. Ive now tried harder than ""The Nut Job"". SCORE 1.1 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and always gets a little happy when he hears winter is coming.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In 2005 former Disney animator Peter Lepeniotis (Toy Story 2 Fantasia 2000) directed ""Surly Squirrel"" a computer-animated short about a foulmouthed municipal rodent who conspires with his rat friend to steal pizza from a park trash can across the street from an in-progress bank robbery. As a short film ""Surly Squirrel"" is a mildly amusing proof-of-talent; it ends in a hail of gunfire and profanity making it a strange choice to expand into a feature-length family film. The Nut Job preserves only the bare bones--a selfish squirrel a raccoon antagonist a bank robbery--and stretches those elements over 85 painfully unfunny minutes.Will Arnett voices Surly a selfish squirrel out to forage food for himself with the help of his mute rat friend Buddy. Surly lives in the park among a group of animals struggling to stockpile food for the winter. This collective includes go-getter squirrel Andie (Katherine Heigl); a suspiciously benevolent overlord Raccoon (Liam Neeson) who relies on a repeated mantra (""For the park""); and the assistance of a minion Mole (Jeff Dunham) to maintain control. (For some indiscernible reason neither of those last two characters have actual names like the others.) A conflict over ransacking a nut cart ends in Surlys banishment but when he and Buddy discover a nut shop--owned by a group of thieves attempting to tunnel under a bank vault across the street--the ""Oceans Eleven meets Ratatouille with a dash of Over The Hedge"" plot commences.Even Pixars early computer-animated shorts now look dated and rudimentary thanks to rapidly advancing animation technology. They play more like software experiments with small and charming story arcs. But with a budget of more than 40 million in 2014 The Nut Job has no excuse for looking this shoddy. The single wide-shot at the end of A Bugs Life conveys more about a park setting than The Nut Job does in almost 90 minutes and the city is empty of any people or animals not strictly tied to the central plot. The film is supposedly set in 1959--note the robbers archetypal accents the old-timey cars and the lack of sophisticated technology--but Psys ""Gangnam Style"" plays prominently into a mid-film dance sequence and a post-credits curtain call (including an animated cameo from the singer himself). But the most egregious problem with The Nut Job is how shamelessly it fills in the gaps left by expanding Lepeniotis short with generic and tedious rogue-to-hero cliche. Every beat of the story is a watered-down jokeless version of previous childrens films; marrying hastily performed dialogue to its insipid outline of a plot The Nut Job seems designed to trick misinformed parents into plopping down money to occupy their children for just over an hour. Only Grayson (Brendan Fraser) a fraudulently lauded moronic hero figure and tangential observation machine provides anything close to a laugh. Arnetts affected wily criminal accent comes and goes while Heigl and especially Neeson should do whatever they can to forget their performances. Prospective attendees would be wise to do the same with the entire film.

Running time 86 minutes. Rated PG (rude humor). At the Empire the Union Square others. Animated features have become so formulized that the late-1950s style of ""The Nut Job is very welcome -- at least until an animated version of South Korean pop star Psy turns up to perform ""Gangnam Style at the end. This Canadian-Korean co-production exhibits a dazzling array of influences from Warner Bros. cartoons to the ""Ice Age series -- to even ""Larceny Inc. (1942) an Edward G. Robinson film based on a play by S.J. and Laura Perelman. And then theres a lead character Surly a scatterbrained and self-absorbed squirrel voiced by Will Arnett -- who looks very much like Remy the rat of the vastly superior ""Ratatouille. When Surlys antics end up immolating a tree containing nuts being stored for the winter he is banished from Oaktons (ironically named) Liberty Park by its leader a raccoon imposingly voiced by Liam Neeson. Surly accidentally stumbles on some crooks who have just purchased a nut shop in order to tunnel to a bank vault across the street (thats the Perelman connection). Our hero is interested only in keeping himself in nuts but his friend Andie (the dreaded Katherine Heigl always better heard than seen) hopes this is a way for Surly to make amends and earn his way back into the park. The small-town setting of a half-century ago is beautifully animated by director Peter Lepenotis and his team and there are some nicely staged old-school action sequences. The slapstick involving Surly his mole sidekick and the gang of crooks (Stephen Lang voices their leader) is often amusing even if the characters arent as well developed as they should be. The celebrity voice performers arent particularly well cast either. The exceptions are Brendan Fraser as Grayson an egotistical squirrel who thinks of himself as a hero and Maya Rudolph as a cowardly bulldog who serves as the negligent guard for the hapless crooks. ""The Nut Job has an interesting anti-socialist subtext with the seemingly benevolent raccoon revealing himself as a power-mad dictator. Its the most political non-Pixar cartoon feature since the very left-leaning ""The Ant Bully eight years ago. The 3-D effects are superfluous so save yourself a few bucks.

"The Nut Job Uninspired animated tale stars squirrels on a mission | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Nut Job Uninspired animated tale stars squirrels on a missionMediocre kids animation The Nut Job scores points for period feel but the characters are hard to warm to.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Jan. 16 2014The Nut JobStarring the voices of Will Arnett Liam Neeson Maya Rudolph Katherine Heigl and Brendan Fraser. Directed by Peter Lepeniotis. 83 minutes. Opens Jan. 17 at major theatres. PGYou may admire larcenous purple squirrel Surlys tenacity in The Nut Job. But when it comes to carrying a screen comedy hes just not up to Scrat.Scrat the bug-eyed acorn-obsessed prehistoric squirrel star of the franchiseIce Age franchise packs far more entertainment into his wordless antics than the wisecracking park-dwellers of The Nut Job.Article Continued BelowIn fact selfish lone-wolf squirrel Surly (voiced by Will Arnett) is a mostly unlikeable hero a concept thats probably too sophisticated for kids who are only looking for a colourful place to munch popcorn for 90 minutes while they cheer talking animals.In fact the biggest laughs and only squeals of delight at a recent Saturday morning screening came during the closing credits when an animated version of South Korean puffball rapper (and Super Bowl pistachio shiller) Psy horsey-danced his way across the screen with various cast members to his monster hit ""Gangnam Style"".The Nut Job offers up a typical critter-versus-humans tale in this Canada-South Korea co-production directed by Peter Lepeniotis and inspired by his 2005 short film Surly Squirrel. The brightly coloured furry beings who reside in an urban park are looking to supplement their dwindling winter food supply by raiding the shuttered nut shop across the street. Coincidentally its the same place that bad-guy gangsters plan to use as their cover while they tunnel into the bank next door.Banished from the park by head creature Raccoon (Liam Neeson sounding like the biggest downer of all time) after a destructive mishap Surly insists hell have no trouble going it alone. He reluctantly lets taciturn rat pal Buddy (looking like a scruffy cousin of Ratatouille rat chef Remy minus the smarts and charm) tag along.Park-dwelling squirrels Andie (Katherine Heigl) a sensible bossy-pants sort and self-absorbed pretty-boy Grayson (Brendan Fraser) scamper off to complete the nut hunt but keep running into trouble from Surly.Surly has problems of his own thanks to a gangsters desperate-to-please pug named Precious (Maya Rudolph). Shes more engaging than any of the wild bunch taking part in a series of pun-packed perilous efforts to get the nut stash out of the store and into the park.Lorne Cameron who brings familiar flourishes from 2006 film Over the Hedge joins Lepeniotis in scriptwriting. They keep engagement at bay with a busy story while forcing a bit too much hubris on a young audience.But if The Nut Job fails to connect through its characters it deserves praise for being a visually inspired effort with clear homage paid to 1950s animation styles especially Warner Bros. classics.Set in a world of coal chutes guys in snappy fedoras and those tan-and-burgundy streetcars so familiar to Torontonians of a certain age The Nut Job looks terrific.The nostalgia piles up with familiar visuals that will take parents back to Saturday morning TV cartoons. But the computer-generated fur and 3D effects (only remarkable in a popcorn explosion that sends kernels flying into the theatre) are definitely 2014. So if the visual vibe leans toward a gentler and more art-forward time in animation storytelling what stopped the filmmakers from following through and applying the same care and style to the script and characters?Instead we get a bunch of (very) shrill know-it-alls and jerks in yet another talking-animal story that goes exactly where expected. And yes as seems to be required of all animated characters now they are also lustily farting.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review The Nut Job 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Review The Nut Job 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Jan 14 2014 430 PM Ever had one of those artificially sweetened candies that taste OK at first but leaves a lingering bitter aftertaste? Thats sort of how it goes with ""The Nut Job."" Peter Lepeniotis animated film brings together a good cast including Will Arnett Brendan Fraser and Liam Neeson which sounds like a sweet deal. But it places them in an uninspired little movie about selfish behavior which while overcome (of course) never really manages to escape its bitter roots. Arnett provides the voice for squirrel Surly whose name is a pretty accurate description of his demeanor. (Perhaps ""Selfish"" is his middle name.) He and his mostly mute rat friend Buddy (Robert Tinkler) scheme about how to feed themselves for the winter planning to knock off a street vendor who sells nuts. Surly is a man apart an independent operator who will have nothing to do with Raccoon (Neeson) and the other animals who live in Liberty Park. There is a shortage of nuts and other food so the prospects for the coming winter look bleak. Raccoon dispatches the strong-willed Andie (Katherine Heigl) and self-centered Grayson (Fraser) to the same street vendors cart. Between them and Surly and Buddy fighting over the cart things go awry what little food the animals do have stored for winter is destroyed and finally Raccoon banishes Surly from the park. (Andie complains a bit about the lack of due process but like other higher-minded concepts in the movie it goes nowhere fast.) After an initial struggle on the streets Surly stumbles onto an entire nut store a kind of heaven on Earth for rodents. It turns out to be a front for mobster King (Stephen Lang) and his hoods so that they can tunnel underground to the bank across the street. Their genius plan to steal cash and replace it with nuts is evidently far too complex and intelligent for the likes of me to understand so good luck with it. Or maybe its just a dumb plot. Either way it doesnt hold much interest. There are betrayals here and unexpected friendships like the one Surly strikes up with Precious (Maya Rudolph) the pug who ostensibly guards the nut shop for the mobsters. But its all a mishmash of emotions and plot points. Nothing gels so theres really not much to care about. Arnett is a great comedic actor an acidic wit. But here his Surly is just a selfish jerk. If there werent some redemption involved this wouldnt be a by-the-numbers animated feature. But it is and there is and it is wholly predictable. On the plus side the film set in the late 1950s (which explains the mobster-moll banter throughout) looks really good with a nice warm glow to its autumn colors. On the negative side an animated version of Psy kicking relevance to the curb comes out at the end and sings ""Gangnam Style"" over the closing credits. What does it have to do with anything in the movie? Nothing or about as much as anything else. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

More Info Trailer Surly Squirrel (Will Arnett) sees himself as an antihero plundering nut stands for his winter stash during a lean year when the other animals in Oakton Park are expecting to starve. After accidentally destroying the small supply of food stockpiled by the squirrels raccoons moles and other urbanized woodland critters Surly is banished from the park and has to make his way on the citys mean rat-infested streets.He discovers a lifetime supply of food at a nut shop beneath which the films bad guys are digging a tunnel into the vault of a nearby bank and the two heists coincide. The films visuals evoke 1940s urban America with vintage cabs fedora-wearing wise guys Irish cops and low-browed palookas but the generic period affectation is undermined by anachronistic jokes and some totally gratuitous ""Gangnam Style.""Good-natured and completely forgettable the film includes Brendan Fraser Liam Neeson and Maya Rudolph as the best character a pug who feels guilty about her lack of aggression toward rodents.

Daily Edition Login to download The Nut Job Film Review 1230 PM PST 1/11/2014 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A whimsical period setting helps this 3D animated caper escape some overly familiar trappings. TWITTER Will Arnett Liam Neeson and Katherine Heigl play hungry park critters who perpetrate a nutty heist in this 3D animated feature. It may not be the freshest acorn in the tree -- as evidenced by an end-credits ""Gangnam Style"" sequence complete with an animated PSY -- but The Nut Job still proves to be a more pleasant diversion than those noisy TV spots would indicate. Benefiting from an inspired period setting that informs both its look and characterizations the heist film wears its vintage Looney Tunes influence prominently in its depiction of a mid-20th century metropolis overrun with Runyonesque types of both the animal and human variety. As voiced by a group of performers including Will Arnett Liam Neeson and Katherine Heigl those divergent tones never quite feel like theyre on the same page (let alone in the same room) but the ensuing antics are sufficiently nutty to engage family audiences. PHOTOS Brrrrrrr Disneys Frozen and 19 Other Wintry Movies A feature-length take on his 2005 animated short Surly Squirrel director Peter Lepeniotis 3D caper is set in fictional Oakton City circa 1959 where a serious late-fall nut shortage is threatening the lives of the foraging inhabitants of Liberty Park. But surviving the winter could be a breeze if the rogue gravelly voiced Surly (Arnett) manages to pull off a heist of epic proportions involving knocking over a nut shop. Banished by the arrogant Raccoon (Neeson) the self-proclaimed leader of the parks denizens Surly initially goes it alone before begrudgingly being joined in his nutty quest by fellow squirrels the compassionate Andie (Heigl) and the narcissistic Grayson (Brendan Fraser) among other rodents. Turns out theyre not the only ones eyeing the nut shop -- so are a bunch of gangsters led by the imposing King (Stephen Lang) intent on tunneling their way into the bank vault just across the street. Despite the pervasive air of familiarity that also extends to the likes of Scrat from the Ice Age films a sidekick rat resembling Ratatouilles Remy and aspects of 2006s Over the Hedge co-written by Nut Job scripter Lorne Cameron the production squeaks by on the visual charm of art director Ian Hastings period touches and warm autumnal hues. The voice talent is a decidedly mixed bag. While Arnetts gruff tones would seem to be well-suited for the surly protagonist the delivery lacks an undercurrent of empathy that would have made for a more likable character. Elsewhere the portrayals tend to come across as either too frantic or too understated to jibe agreeably with the notable exception of Maya Rudolph who practically steals the show as Precious an eager-to-please bug-eyed pug.

""The Nut Job"" has a similarly tampered-with quality. A movie so schizophrenic that it feels like several teams of artists worked on it without consulting with each other its constantly shooting out in a million directions. The cars and human clothing for instance suggest that the movie is a period piece set in the 1950s. Does that mean you wont hear dubstep and played-out novelty hit ""Gangnam Style"" on the soundtrack? Nope. Did anyone notice that the squirrel heroes have no idea in Act One that fire and a propane tank are bad news but in Act Three they understand the consequences of a lit stick of dynamite? Again nuh-uh. Set mostly in one city block admittedly a huge amount of space if youre a squirrel ""The Nut Job"" begins with Raccoon (voiced by Liam Neeson) lamenting that there isnt enough food stored away to get the park animals through the cold months. (One character actually says ""Winter is coming"" but any resemblance to ""Game of Thrones"" is no doubt purely unintentional.) Also read Liam Neeson Adds His Voice as The Nut Job Villain Alongside Will Arnett Katherine Heigl Two squirrels -- resourceful Andie (Katherine Heigl) and vain Grayson (Brendan Fraser) -- are dispatched to hijack a hot-nuts vendor cart that has set up shop just outside the park but theyre beaten to it by rogue Surly (Will Arnett) and his somewhat dim rat accomplice Buddy (whose character design is so similar to the protagonist of ""Ratatouille"" that Pixar should sue). That initial heist goes terribly wrong with the aforementioned propane destroying what little food was in reserves so Surly is banished from the park. Out on the mean streets however he discovers an entire nut store. Surlys dreams of a well-fed winter encounter complications in the form of a gang of bumbling bank robbers who are using the joint as a way to break into the bank vault next door. ""The Nut Job"" never seems sure who its target audience is supposed to be -- the best animated films from the Looney Tunes shorts to the feature films of Pixar and Studio Ghibli tell stories that adults and children can both enjoy. They assume that grown-ups havent completely abandoned their youthful sense of wonder and that younger audiences are smart and attentive enough that they dont need to be condescended to. Also read Buying Pixar Didnt Kill Disney Animation -- It Saved It In this messy script by Lorne Cameron and director Peter Lepeniotis however fart jokes and a high-strung talking pug (Maya Rudolph) coexist uneasily with an overly complicated plot (why do the bank robbers need the nuts again?) and a sub-""Animal Farm"" political allegory that manages to be simultaneously anti-collectivist and anti-objectivist. To use a phrase I often have to come back to when discussing unsuccessful comedies All of this would be forgivable if it were funny. But ""The Nut Job"" is merely shrill and frantic chock-full of uninspired characters and tedious wackiness. Giving credit where its due the animation is quite lovely from the character design (except for Buddy) to the period details to the parks mighty trees bursting with autumnal foliage. Even when its annoying to listen to ""The Nut Job"" often gives you something nice to look at; still dont spend extra for 3D since theres only one moment in the film when the director apparently remembered to make use of it. Also read Angry Birds Movie in Safe Hands With Animation Veterans as Co-Directors Parents and children with a deep desire to see an animated film about storing food for winter would be better off watching ""A Bugs Life"" again and if youre jonesing for wisecracking rodents Bugs Bunny remains king of that particular hill. ""The Nut Job"" unfortunately tries to hard to appeal to both kids and adults and will wind up pleasing neither. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Computer-animated critters have been coveting nuts since at least the Ice Age which means squirrely Surly star of ""The Nut Job"" descends from a proud if exasperated tradition of animated acorn stealers. By way of novelty this sharp-looking but otherwise uninspired Canadian-Korean venture gives its resident rodent a chance to steal a lifetime supply from a gang of crooks whove opened a nut shop adjacent to the bank they plan to rob. The critters look cute but behave less so while the competing-heists concept never quite takes off. Still at a low cost of 43 million the 3D toon should easily make its nut in the States before cleaning up abroad. Credit Disney vet Ken Duncan and the artists at Canadian outfit ToonBox Entertainment with designing what is quite possibly the cutest pack of scavengers to hit the screen since Don Bluth (""An American Tail"" ""The Secret of NIMH"") put down his pencil. Alas design is but a part of an animated characters appeal the rest of which takes shape through casting and the screenplay itself and in those two respects ""The Nut Job"" comes up short compared with a film like ""Ratatouille"" which despite its less-than-adorable rodents won audiences over through appealing voicework and writing. Here you have a grating actor Will Arnett playing a character -- first seen in director Peter Lepeniotis short film ""Surly Squirrel"" -- whos as abrasive as his name would suggest an aggressively selfish animal with no interest in helping the rest of Liberty Parks animal inhabitants replace the winter stockpile he accidentally set aflame. (The pics most spectacular 3D shot involves watching Raccoons closely guarded oak tree burst into flames sending virtual corn kernels popping in viewers faces.) Of course selfishness alone isnt enough to sabotage a cartoon squirrel. That very same quality has motivated ""Ice Ages"" Scrat since the beginning and yet replace a well-choreographed ""Its all mine"" pantomime routine with over-the-top Michael Bay-style action sequences and the charm instantly evaporates. Though charm was in pretty short supply already as the scripts inability to resist even the laziest pun starts to make its fart jokes seem clever by comparison. After destroying the local food supply Surly is banished by Raccoon (Liam Neeson) and his fellow park-dwellers to a life on the streets of Oakton a city with an endearing mid-century all-American look about it. Seen from a squirrels p.o.v. however its full of dangers huge shuffling feet mangy rats falling bricks and so on. Lucky for Surly he quickly manages to locate Oaktons nut shop which we soon discover is little more than a cover operation for a bunch of mafia types elaborate bank heist already in progress. While the criminals (headed up by the Stephen Lang-voiced King) tunnel into the bank vault next door Surly and his friends attempt to burrow into the nut shop itself. Trouble is nothing much stands in their way apart from an adorable pug named Precious (Maya Rudolph) whom Surly swiftly learns to control via a discarded dog whistle. And so with the animals goal so easily achieved Lepeniotis and co-writer Lorne Cameron (""Over the Hedge"") are left to fall back on stale twists such as revealing Raccoon as an ""Animal Farm""-style tyrant who manipulates his herd according to the motto ""Animals are controlled by the amount of food they have."" That would seem to be an almost anti-consumerist lesson tucked away within a film that if its producers had their way would inspire toys tie-ins and sequels galore. Such crass commercialism coupled with a strange sense of national pride from the South Korean entities that put up most of the money surely explains how a computer-animated Psy came to hijack the end credits. This ""Gangnam Style"" musicvideo certainly doesnt fit with the almost Marxian lesson in working together for the Common Good that the pic seems to be peddling otherwise. Or maybe it has something to do with Psys recent role as a pistachio pitchman -- as if this pic werent nutty enough already.
