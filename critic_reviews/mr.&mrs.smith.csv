Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Twentieth Century Fox The new movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as a married gun-toting couple. Reviewer Bob Mondello says its a reasonably amusing summer picture if you can put your critical mind in neutral. MELISSA BLOCK host There is at least one place where the sexes are equal. Angelina Jolie proves shes just as good at being an assassin as Brad Pitt in Hollywoods new movie ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith."" The films advertisements have been everywhere as has speculation about a reported off-screen romance between the stars. Does the movie live up to the hype? Heres our critic Bob Mondello. BOB MONDELLO reporting You already know the basic premise of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""--married assassins whove somehow managed to keep from each other that they are assassins. Mrs. Smith thinks her husband works in construction Mr. Smith thinks his wife programs computers and their marriage is all about buying new curtains and trying new recipes until they discover that they are in fact working for rival hit squads at which point things heat up somewhat. (Soundbite of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"") (Soundbite of gunfire) Ms. ANGELINA JOLIE (As Jane Smith) You still alive baby? MONDELLO Of course he is. There wouldnt be a movie if he wasnt. (Soundbite of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"") (Soundbite of gunfire) MONDELLO The films marital discord story line seems designed to appeal to the unmarried especially the prime summer movie audience 18- to 24-year-olds who can still imagine their own lives and maybe their own bodies taking on the contours they see on screen. An older crowd is going to find things less plausible but the filmmakers have provided something for them too some serious home furnishing carnage. For highly paid assassins ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" dont shoot very straight but those stray bullets do quite a demolition job on their kitchen. Waitll you see what a semiautomatic with an unlimited ammo clip can do to a stainless steel refrigerator. (Soundbite of ""Mrs. and Mrs. Smith"") Mr. BRAD PITT (As John Smith) Your aims as bad as your cooking sweetheart. (Soundbite of gunfire) MONDELLO Apart from being just as relentless as it sounds this is all very liberating apparently because once theres shattered glass and splinters everywhere the two stars cant resist rolling around amorously. Their sex life was terrible when they were hiding their guns under floorboards and in cleverly camouflaged ovens. But it gets much better once theyve trashed the place. Its at about this point that they turn their joint attention to the folks who still want them dead by bantering away while leading other assassins on a merry highway chase in a neighbors minivan. (Soundbite of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"") Mr. PITT (As John Smith) You know I should probably tell--I was married once before. (Soundbite of a speeding vehicle and gunfire) Ms. JOLIE (As Jane Smith) Whats her name and Social Security number? Mr. PITT (As John Smith) No youre not going to kill her. MONDELLO Here again the screenplay makes them shoppers just like the rest of us with Mrs. Smith establishing that the minivan has fine road-handling and stability while Mr. Smith tests the options package by tossing an attacker right through the rear seating. (Soundbite of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"") Mr. PITT (As John Smith) Doors are handy. MONDELLO Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie hardly qualify as a latter-day William Powell and Myrna Loy but they handle the Nick and Nora Charles-style zingers with enough snap that you can generally tell theyre zingers. And their tan buff photogenic selves certainly are easy on the eyes especially in close-ups when their lips are the size of throw pillows. Simon Kinbergs screenplay isnt as long on logic as it is just plain long about getting to a climax that at least seems appropriate for a movie so besotted with consumer products--a shootout that trashes an entire home furnishing store. That allows the stars to toss around some very expensive knives in the kitchen department. Doug Limans cheerfully breathless direction doesnt bother making products in the other departments lethal but he may just be saving that for ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith II Renovations."" The studios accountants would no doubt be ecstatic--a franchise for the over-30 set if that is they can get a sequel out before the housing bubble bursts. Im Bob Mondello.

"Killer Bodies washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Killer Bodies Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play husband-and-wife assassins neither of whom knows what the other does for a living. (Stephen Vaughn) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 10 2005 ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" is about a marriage in meltdown about a woman whose husband is leading a disturbing double life and the havoc she wreaks when she discovers his duplicity. Poor Jennifer Aniston. Oh come on. You know thats what youre thinking. ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie may putatively be a romantic action comedy about a couple of suburb-dwelling hired killers but for millions of tabloid readers its the movie that brought Pitt and Jolie together resulting in Aniston filing for divorce. Of course Pitt and Jolies relationship is still a subject of pure speculation which theyve artfully manipulated during the publicity run-up to their movies opening. But when millions of filmgoers queue up to watch ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" this weekend it wont be for clever repartee big explosions or steamy sex (which reportedly has been edited out anyway); it will be to ascertain firsthand whether this is a romance of Bogie-and-Bacall proportions or just another Cruise-and-Holmes stunt. What this critic can report is that Pitt and Jolie create genuine sparks in ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" when the movie gives them the time and space to resemble sentient human beings. And thats a narrow window indeed. As directed by Doug Liman (""Go"" ""Swingers"") this hectically paced pastiche seems less interested in exploiting the couples sophisticated sexy dynamic than in plunging them into ever more cartoonlike scenes of carnage. What could have been a playful throwback to the banter of the ""Thin Man"" movies and the derring-do of James Bond instead becomes a live-action episode of ""The Itchy and Scratchy Show"" from ""The Simpsons."" Granted its ""The Itchy and Scratchy Show"" featuring two of the most physically flawless human beings on the planet. As ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" opens John Smith (Pitt) and Jane Smith (Jolie) are in couples therapy each facing the camera directly while an off-screen therapist throws them probing questions. As they deliver the quietly devastating answers that will be familiar to anyone whos been married longer than a year the true purpose of ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" becomes clear This is a movie about two impossibly attractive mega-stars regarding each other and in turn basking in our regard. As long as the audience is okay with that -- as long as they dont go into the theater expecting anything as distracting as a logical story or some kind of emotional arc--well then bring on the extra-large popcorn and let the Big Slurps flow. And youre gonna need em. Clocking in just shy of two hours ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" will prove a long hard slog for filmgoers who dont think that simply gazing at Pitt and Jolie constitutes a fun night out. After its promising set-up the movie takes viewers back in time to when John and Jane first met--each was unbeknownst to the other on a hit job--through their subsequent marriage and back to the present where theyre living in a well-manicured suburban house with all the modern conveniences. Of course for Jane this means a fully appointed arsenal of knives and other weapons hidden in the warming oven; for John its a potting shed full of heavy-duty ordnance. The premise of ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" is that these two have gone six years without ever telling each other what they do for a living which is the first whopper the audience is asked to swallow. The next is that when John and Jane are mistakenly double-booked on a job they set out to kill each other. For all its broad physical action and ostensibly hip humor (Vince Vaughn shows up in an uncredited role to deliver the movies only truly funny lines) ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" is really a meta-movie one in which were supposed to snicker at the concept of two glamorous assassins living in the burbs but in which were really enjoying the preposterous notion of Pitt and Jolie themselves doing anything as prosaic as arguing about curtains or cooking pot roast. (That last scene by the way is just one of several that suffers from weirdly slow pacing.) Pitt and Jolie throw off unmistakable heat but little warmth; indeed at times the entire exercise seems creepily cold and calculated. As Janes attempts to kill John escalate (the joke is that shes the more coldblooded of the two he still wants to work things out) the similarities to seduction become strenuously apparent; there are enough sex-and-death double-entendres in ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" to make Freud blush. As the movie takes its players into bigger and more bombastic shootouts featuring bigger and higher-tech gimcrackery it becomes clear that John and Jane arent characters as much as props with their knock-out bodies extravagantly beautiful faces and great clothes serving as so much set dressing. Its telling -- and appropriate -- that one of the movies several climaxes involves Pitt and Jolie disguising themselves as mannequins for thats precisely what they are. This isnt ""The War of the Roses"" its ""The War of the Poses."" Comparisons with Danny DeVitos toxic 1989 domestic comedy will be inevitable as will parallels to the great battle-of-the-sexes comedies of Hollywoods Golden Age. But to watch ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" which continually sacrifices its potential for sophisticated fun on the altar of style and physical stunts is to realize how far weve come from the great movies of say George Cukor or Howard Hawks. Those names will mean nothing to Pitts and Jolies fans of course; they barely register now. But some of us would still take those directors genuinely knowing--and subversive--sexual wit over mere physical perfection any day. Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith (112 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence intense action sexual content and brief strong language.

Directed by Doug Liman from a screenplay by Simon Kinberg. 130 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence intense action sexual content and brief strong language. Several theaters. After watching ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" naive moviegoers might be forgiven for thinking that Angelina Jolie was actually a brilliantly conceived CGI effect. She looks far too exquisite to be real (those lips those eyes that hair that flare of the nostril) and when these looks are combined with an almost sub-Arctic coolness and an ability to balance on the back of an armchair in stiletto heels the result is -- well I dont quite know what it is but its impressive. At one point in the film Jolie exits a sky-high hotel room by rappelling at laser speed down the side of the building. She lands smoothly takes a dainty breath and says ""Taxi?"" You know the stunts done with smoke and mirrors but Jolies great gift is that you absolutely believe that she could do it and probably complete some United Nations volunteer work on the way down. But her sexy superwoman persona is too big for most movies which tend to look silly and a little frightened in her wake. And such alas is the case with ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" a muddled mess which can now be added to the long list of Movies That Dont Know What To Do With Angelina Jolie. (On that list the ""Lara Croft"" movies ""Taking Lives"" ""Original Sin"" ""Life or Something Like It"" just for starters. She has really only recently registered in ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" as a dominatrix-like pilot with an eyepatch barking out commands and watching underlings jump.) In Doug Limans film Jolie and Brad Pitt play a wife and husband who each have a secret identity as a professional assassin. They live in an elegant suburban home (his guns are hidden in the garage; her knives are cached in the oven) where she wears aprons and fusses over new curtains; he dons an argyle cardigan and asks her about her day. (He thinks she runs a tech support company; she thinks hes a contractor.) In the early scenes Liman understands the goofiness of these two larger-than-life creatures talking about pot roast and draperies and the movie has an appealing self-deprecating humor. But when John and Jane each receive the assignment to bump off the other ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" veers off course never to return. There are only so many ways to kill a person or to narrowly fail to kill a person and the movie dutifully goes through the checklist but it all feels random and hyped-up. We never really get to know these people -- both Jolie and Pitt play their characters so coolly and have so little in Simon Kinbergs screenplay to work with we have no idea what theyre really like other than that they both look hot and are very good at raising their eyebrows. So as they wreak havoc on their pretty home and on each other and then switch instantly from violence to lovemaking (bad idea as theres broken glass all over the floor) we watch them with the same cool detachment. Some of the stunts are impressive but so what? Essentially ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" exists for the purpose of showing off the gorgeous faces and physiques of its two stars and for giving its audience the dubious pleasure of watching them beat each other up. Theres the grain of a good idea here which has been explored in other better movies like ""Prizzis Honor"" but Liman and Kinberg seem less interested in story and character than in quick cuts stunts and double entendres. Pitt who breezes through the movie with a slightly amused expression and Jolie make a zingy team and Vince Vaughn is funny as Pitts sidekick (""They all try to kill you"" he says of women in general). Pity they couldnt have had better material. Taxi?

Photo Credit Stephen Vaughn ... more Its nothing personal -- each of them has a job to do. Of course it is a deadly business. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Mr amp; Mrs. Smith Action comedy. Starring Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie and Vince Vaughn. Directed by Doug Liman. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" is an awful movie with two very good-looking people in it. The charms of its stars are unmistakable -- what with all the close-ups and smirking -- but in the end they provide no distraction. The tiny smidgen of cleverness on display here is contained entirely in the premise. The follow-through is nonexistent. The film is glossy but awful. Frenetic but awful. Expensive but awful. ... And awful. If any story ever demanded an ironic caustic tone this was it but the filmmakers never find it. It doesnt seem as though they even had the sense to go look. The picture is the story of a husband and wife each of whom works on the sly as a paid assassin. They work for rival companies and the fun ensues when their bosses insist that they each kill the other. To make a premise like this amusing and not repellent some heightening of reality is required some alteration of the ethical universe some twist in the scheme of things. Forget it. Instead the movie just throws Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at us and has them smirk at us for two hours. Were supposed to like it. End of discussion. Indeed far from heightening the reality screenwriter Simon Kinberg and director Doug Liman go so far as to deliberately flatten it out to get laughs out of the contrast between the Smiths exotic careers and their mundane middle-class existence. We see them returning home every night from ""the office"" having dinner and talking about what they did all day. These scenes are mildly funny. The audience laughs because the audience knows theyre lying to each other. The Smiths live together but their contact is entirely on the surface. They have the trappings of domestic closeness but theyre strangers. But this is a problem for the movie and it becomes obvious once the Smiths are paired off against each other. If they really dont have a marriage and dont have any real closeness whats the problem with them killing each other? If theres nothing real there to save whats the loss for them -- or us? At the same time why should we care about either of them anyway? All we know about her is that she snaps a guys neck in the first minutes of the movie. All we know about him is that he kills four people in a card game. No reason is given. Plainly Mr. Smith is evil. Mrs. Smith is evil. And they have a lousy marriage. So maybe it wouldnt be so bad if the Smiths died and decreased the surplus population. In the absence of a rooting interest ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" can rely only on wit and spectacle to hold our interest. Forget wit. Screenwriter Kinberg was the author of ""XXX State of the Union"" and this is like his version of ""Private Lives"" -- no wit all guns. That leaves us with mere spectacle which takes the form of shootouts. There are shootouts between the Smiths but we know they cant kill each other. And there are other shootouts between the Smiths and other people but we know no one can kill them. So much for suspense. In the end the only real spectacle worth noting is that of Pitt and Jolie in close-up. Pitt is becoming more and more Redford-like (a good thing) and Jolie remains something to look at a real movie creature. To see her is to wonder what horror movies shell be making when she reaches her ""Baby Jane"" years. Shes arresting beautiful without being even remotely lovely. Thats not necessarily a bad thing either. But Jolie is wrong for the role. Pitt is engaging despite the lack of clever dialogue to help him. But Jolie is only tough which is the wrong essence for absurdist comedy. The joke is supposed to be that no one would expect the Smiths to be paid assassins. With Jolie its not that much of a stretch. Its more of a stretch to picture her hustling for laughs. ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" could never have been good but it definitely called for an actress with a lighter touch someone such as Robin Wright Penn or Carla Gugino -- or Jennifer Aniston. -- Advisory Nonstop shootings and death sexual situations.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Heres an exchange overheard after a preview screening of the wickedly entertaining ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. ""Did you like it?"" A father asked his pre-teen son. ""Not really"" the boy answered. This negative answer is actually a positive sign. Because what would it say about the state of our unions if a kid understood too well this tart tasty occasionally overly brutal parable about modern marriage wrapped in an action flick? As ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" opens John and Jane Smith sit in chairs facing the camera. You would be forgiven if you imagine for a quick post-modern instant that Pitt Jolie and director Doug Liman added an ironic prologue to the movie as a cheeky nod to all the tabloid reports about the stars romance. But no. John and Jane Smith five years (or is it six? they cant agree) into their relationship are dipping into some much-needed couples therapy. On the surface their problem points to the suburban-life blues The same old routine of shopping and cooking for her and driving off to work for him; the neighbors who bore them both. The truth - a very relative term for the J. Smiths - is that unbeknownst to John or Jane their mate is an assassin at the top of their profession. They ply their lethal trade for rival government agencies. The foxy operatives met and fell in love while in Latin America. Like all the stories they tell the therapist this is and isnt quite true. Once back in the United States they confide their affection for the other to their best friends and colleagues played by Vince Vaughn (""DodgeBall"") and Kerry Washington (""Ray"").Vaughn who does his best work when chewing up scenes in a character role is a hungry hoot as an agency hit man who lives with his mom. Over time the Smiths marriage goes from sexy affection to workaday ennui to positively endangered. When an assignment to take out an improbable target goes awry Jane and John are ordered by their shadowy bosses to kill the other. One of the many pleasures of ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" is Janes competitiveness. In their race to off the other Janes commitment confounds John. She recalls their anniversary with precision. But shes hardly hampered by sentiment when she tries to kill her husband. John may not recall an important date but he at least seems emotionally conflicted by the assignment. ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" attests to the many forces that can work to scuttle a marriage. The internal ones are fairly commonplace. The wee secrets and fibs that become immense over time will strike many as familiar. Of course given their clandestine work theirs turn out to be a bit more extreme. And when they are finally getting to know each other - during a car chase naturally - the list of lies has them (and us) wondering if anything in this marriage was ever true. The external forces give the couple a ""me and you against the world"" solidarity. The fact that Jane can give as good as she gets has to be made convincingly often and with humor. Otherwise Liman might lose a good portion of the audience when the couple has a to-the-death tango that leaves their perfect home in shambles. As audiences watch Jane and John go at it some will recall Danny DeVitos ""The War of the Roses."" The 1989 film starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner as a once-loving couple was an astonishingly violent comedy about what happens to a couple when sweet matrimony turns into savage acrimony. Things ended badly for that battling couple. Director Liman screenwriter Simon Kinberg and the stars do a nice job of keeping it a movie-length mystery what sort of end their couple meets. When it does come it says something intriguing about the work of modern marriage. And it says it with far more panache and odd wisdom than anything offered on ""The Bachelor.""

It tries so hard to be cute that it practically drools on your shoulder. The film has only one idea and that is a stolen one. Suburban superspy goes to work at the assassination bureau each day without the spouse suspecting? I saw ""True Lies"" too. John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) Smith are both unbeknownst to each another professional killers who cache their weapons in their immaculate house in a town outside New York. Theyre clueless until the day when in the course of chasing the same target they nearly shoot each other by accident. Youd think theyd compare notes to work out what went wrong since if either was really hired to kill the other the deed could easily have been done any time in the years theyve been together. Instead they try to kill each other. Simon Kinbergs screenplay was his masters thesis at Columbia Film School; presumably it received a grade of Incomplete. Sixty pages go by untouched by any idea except ""they try to kill each other."" The Smiths absurdly complicated attempts to whack each other - obviously inspired by the old Mad magazine feature ""Spy vs. Spy"" - are punctuated with one-liners that are perfect for the time and place if this is 1958 and were summering in the Catskills. Threatening to kill Jane John says ""I could push the button any time."" ""Baby"" she purrs ""you couldnt find the button with both hands and a map."" Eww. When she tries to shoot him in their house he says ""Your aim is as bad as your cooking sweetheart."" Check please. The wildly implausible shootouts - none quite so hard to believe as the scene where Irishmen drink Guinness out of bottles - are accompanied by an isnt-this-funny score straight out of ""Desperate Housewives."" Not only did Kinberg fail to craft a plot he forgot to give personalities to his lead characters or invent notable supporting roles (except for fellow assassin Vince Vaughn who has been furnished with a single joke He lives with his mother.) Everyone sure looks good though. Its even tough to tell who is the prettier girl Jolie or Pitt? That one may stump the philosophers but here is one vote for the former. Jane Smith is a jolie fair maiden whether clad in a low-cut white shirt a low-cut black dress a white bra a black bra complex dominatrix gear or a simple bedsheet. In close-ups her lips are 3 feet thick nearly double what Jolies are in real life and Mrs. Smith implies she has had 312 lovers - just do your own joke here. Since this is a suburban womans fantasy the missus must be a bit better at every task than the mister - even though she seems to be giving up 70 pounds and 6 inches of reach. Also everyone must talk like a suburban woman even supposed tough guys under threat of death. A guy friend of Johns coos ""I love the floors - what are they teak?"" And when Jane asks John for his last words he replies ""The new curtains are hideous."" There is never the sense that either lead is ever in the slightest danger an attitude that renders the action campy rather than exciting. During the big final blowout set in one of those nesting superstores youll be looking at the kitchenware instead of the shooting.

"Smith A Marriage Of Mayhem And Wit washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On On Screen Smith A Marriage Of Mayhem And Wit Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 10 2005 IF YOU KNOW only one thing about ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" other than the fact that it stars Brangelina -- which is to say Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for those who dont read the entertainment mags -- you probably also know that its about husband-and-wife assassins who wake up one day to discover that their next targets are . . . each other. And if you know this much you can probably also guess that theres really only one plot trajectory it can possibly follow and thats Kiss kiss bang bang. Or rather Bang bang kiss kiss. By which I mean that they first try to kill each other and then um they dont. Yes there will be make-up sex in this movie and it will be hot (or at least as hot as a PG-13 movie can get). How can it not be when its Brad and Angelina? Hey you got to give the people what they want. Interestingly by the time we get to the make-up sex the movie is only halfway over. So where does it go from there? Actually to some highly enjoyable places. Such as the interior of a speeding minivan which is put through exceedingly un-soccer-mom-ish paces as our heroes John and Jane Smith still not exactly lovey-dovey but now united against a new and common enemy -- the result of an unexpected twist -- tear down the highway shooting bullets at other bad guys while bickering like a couple of old marrieds. The best touch Air Supplys syrupy 1983 hit ""Making Love Out of Nothing at All"" playing over the car stereo with Pitt singing along. Another great scene takes place in one of those big-box stores you see all over suburbia a setting whose Middle American vibe gives director Doug Liman ample opportunity to have fun while staging the films exciting violent and deadpan-witty climax which evokes everything from ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" to the ""Kill Bill"" films. This wry juxtaposition of highly trained killers performing their jobs within the pedestrian circumstances of well my life is precisely whats best about ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" a film whose darkly comic script by Simon Kinberg evokes the deadly/sexy mood of the Coen brothers equally acerbic ""Intolerable Cruelty"" as well as ""Prizzis Honor."" Its a script where lines such as ""I missed you"" and ""I missed you too"" take on a deliciously blackhearted double-entendre and where the normal pitfalls of couplehood get perverted into something wonderfully sick. For example like a husband who gets jealous after finding out his wife has had more lovers than he John goes a little green when he learns that the number of his confirmed career kills (50 or 60 tops) pales in comparison to Janes 312. Ouch. Then theres Johns best friend and co-worker in the hit man trade Eddie (Vince Vaughn) a divorce who lives with his mother amid all manner of killing implements and sad bachelor paraphernalia. He along with the rest of the talented supporting cast make ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" a kicky twisted thrill ride with enough laughs to leaven what can be read at heart as a metaphor for the modern marriage. MR. amp; MRS. SMITH (PG-13 112 minutes) -- Contains obscenity violence and sexual content. Area theaters.

Who knows? And really who cares? Havent we had our fill of much-publicized Hollywood romances lately? Marriage and mayhem Pitt and Jolie are husband-and-wife assassins. 20th Century Fox What is worth caring about is the winning job Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie do in portraying a couple in their entertaining but flawed film Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith. By now most people know the premise Two not-so-blissfully wed secret assassins are contracted to kill each other. Mayhem and marital strife ensue. The best moments in the action-packed romantic comedy are when the couple exhibit their considerable chemistry. Whether sitting side-by-side and haltingly discussing their marriage with a shrink bickering about banalities or setting off sexual sparks theyre always fun to watch -- and not simply because theyre gorgeous. About the movie Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith    (out of four) Stars Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie Vince Vaughn Kerry Washington Adam Brody Director Doug Liman Distributor 20th Century Fox Running time 1 hour 55 minutes Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence intense action sexual content and brief strong language Opens Friday nationwide The key to the movie is their banter not the explosions car chases and gunplay that clutter things up. We get why they come alive from their marital doldrums when they discover what each really does for a living. Their repressed anger gushes forth in often hilarious ways. Pitt and Jolie have an ease with well-written lines. But you wish for more clever dialogue and fewer action-flick cliches. Its as if the movie is trying to be all things to all audiences. And that rarely works. Blending two disparate genres romantic comedy and action-adventure is tricky. And director Doug Liman doesnt always do it artfully. Liman has fashioned a high-concept movie that occasionally grows numbing during lengthy action sequences and tedious with scenes of online sleuthing and high-tech gadgetry. But weaknesses aside Mr.amp; Mrs. Smith offers a witty look at matrimony and its day-to-day tribulations. If this glam pair with their sleek elegant house and high-risk professions find little to talk about over dinner -- save for the peas recently added to a recipe -- what hope is there for us mortals? This date movie should generate plenty of discussion on the ride home. Jolie and Pitt project more than just body heat. They convey a multi-faceted attraction toss off clever repartee and dazzle audiences with their seemingly natural connection. And thats worth watching.

"Mr. and Mrs. Smith | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mr-and-mrs-smith ) Mr. and Mrs. Smith (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli The problem with Mr. and Mrs. Smith is that its really two movies in one. The first is a sly comedy/thriller worthy of Hitchcock and the other is a big noisy summer action flick. The marriage of these two like that of the title characters is tempestuous with each side in a constant struggle for dominance. When Mr. and Mrs. Smith is smart and sassy its a lot of fun. But when its loud and dumb (which is too often for my taste) its mindless and a little tedious. This is mediocre forgettable entertainment. It doesnt really satisfy but you probably wont exit the theater feeling gypped. The premise is simple enough John and Jane Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) are a happily married couple who work as assassins for rival firms. Neither is aware of the others occupation and to the outside world they look like a traditional upper-class suburban couple albeit without the dog and the 2.5 kids. In fact to keep the spark in their marriage of five or six years they visit a marriage counselor. Then one unfortunate day a client double-books a hit with John and Jane unknowingly assigned to eliminate the same target. When their take-down schemes prove to be incompatible they lose the mark and discover a few things about each other. The resulting domestic strife makes the events of War of the Roses seem tame by comparison. When director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity) focuses on the characters and their non-traditional relationship hes on safe ground. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie smolder and their chemistry (regardless of whether it did or did not expand beyond the screen) couldnt be better. Whether theyre shooting at each other tossing around double entendres or ripping each others clothing off Mr. and Mrs. Smiths two stars are sexy and magnetic. Foreplay for the Smiths involves not only disrobing but disarming. And Simon Kinbergs screenplay gives the actors plenty of delicious lines to chew on. Unfortunately the script also calls for too much action and thats where everything falls apart. Although Liman tries to juice things up by using atypical camera angles all this does is to lend an artistic flavor to a series of otherwise banal explosions shoot-outs and car chases. The film has so much action padding that it becomes tiresome after a while. Ten or fifteen years ago this sort of thing might have been cutting edge but the bar has been raised so many times that not even a car racing the wrong way on a freeway can generate more than a half-hearted shrug. The film also doesnt have the decency to give us a legitimate payoff. The film justa| ends. Theres a big violent action scene complete with John Woo-inspired choreography and more ammunition than Rambo ever laid eyes on  but the opponents are faceless. Theres no uber villain to rub out in a climactic showdown. And the more you think about it (I know I knowa| not something were supposed to do with this kind of movie) the less sense it all makes. I mean how can this really be over when its over? What about all the loose ends that the interior decorator and marriage counselor cant resolve? For the most part the movie belongs to Pitt and Jolie. Vince Vaughn and Kerry Washington play their respective best friends/cohorts but they dont have a lot of screen time. Vaughn makes the best of his. This may be the actors most entertaining performance in a long time. He has his share of funny moments but Liman wisely keeps him in check. Washington doesnt fare as well. Unlike Vaughn she doesnt have a single memorable scene. This is one of those films where the pluses and minuses almost exactly counterbalance each other. For every scene that works because of the snappy dialogue or the Pitt/Jolie rapport theres a drawn-out action scene that causes everything to grind to a halt. Mr. and Mrs. Smiths need for blockbuster pyrotechnics undermines the black comedy (theres plenty of that) and the offbeat romance both of which are strong enough to form the foundation of a quieter motion picture. The only legitimate tension in the story is between Mr. and Mrs. Smith. When they are turned into superheroes fighting against teams of nameless clad-in-black foes the time has come to tune out. Its too bad that Liman didnt streamline his production better and leave the fireworks for the fourth of July.

Built on premise that a great-looking husband and wife are paid killers without the other knowing about it the two-hander pirouettes entirely on the charm generated by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. B.O. legs dont look as long as those of the leading lady. Marital therapy acquires life-or-death ramifications in ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" an exhaustingly elaborate romantic fantasy actioner. Built on the cutesy premise that a great-looking husband and wife are paid killers without the other knowing about it the at-least 110 million two-hander pirouettes entirely on the scripts whimsical approach to serious business and the charm generated by leads Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. But it doesnt take long for the souffle to fall. Fox is doing everything possible to assure a big near-worldwide opening June 10 which the two stars should help foster but B.O. legs dont look as long as those of the leading lady. Okay this isnt ""Gigli"" perhaps the last big studio film to boast a similar complement of combustible on-and-off screen romance production delays and budget overruns. On the other hand it certainly isnt ""Trouble in Paradise"" the Ernst Lubitsch classic that stands as the model of a romantic comedy about two competing criminals who fall in love. Nor does it have anything to do with Alfred Hitchcocks 1941 film of the same title -- the directors only outright comedy. Originally penned by scenarist-du-jour Simon Kinberg (""XXX State of the Union"" ""Fantastic Four"") as his thesis for a masters degree at Columbia ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" essentially takes the view that as passion and excitement in marriage is destined to fade what a couple needs is a little mortal combat to spice it up. Well whatever turns you on but be warned that the marital aids on display here cost a tad more than those on offer at the neighborhood adult toys shop; they include enough state-of-the-art spy equipment computer gear heavy artillery and shiny kitchen utensils to assure the successful invasion of a medium-sized country. The couples meet-cute actually is as John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) are thrown together under mutual duress in Bogota. When you look like these two one thing leads to another very quickly; Pitt and Jolie hardly need any sexing up as it is but they are lavished with visual caresses by director Doug Liman and lenser Bojan Bazelli to an extraordinary degree which certainly makes the picture easy on the eye. Five or six years later (they can never agree on which) the Smiths are living in acute domestic luxury with a pinch of marital fatigue in the equation alluded to in a succession of straight-to-camera therapy sessions that prove alternately amusing and coy. The truth about their identical professions their proficiency at what they do and the effectiveness of their lies to each other over the stretch of the marriage emerge in the vigorous intercutting of respective hits they pull off on one busy New York City night. But their next jobs prove disastrous They are assigned to take out the same guy at the same time by their respective unnamed agencies. The way they keep their mutual realizations of these circumstances secret -- and then try to rub out each other -- generates the only mild intrigue the piece can manage. Thereafter the film tries but fails to build an emotional head of steam from the idea that the torrent of truth-telling they kick-start to make up for five (or is it six?) years of lying provides the basis for a new-and-improved marriage. This is one of those films for which viewers willing to buy into the premise might happily go along for the ride. For those who find it resistible if not preposterous however ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" proves a very long haul indeed. The sheer weight and volume of mayhem toward the end is numbing and meaningless and two hours is a good 25 minutes more than such a frail conceit can sustain. As he proved on ""Go"" and ""The Bourne Identity"" Liman can shoot the hell out of a scene coming up with fresh angles and details to put ordinary happenings in sharp relief. But despite deft pacing within individual sequences and an admirable talent for throwaway humor its mostly overkill here a case of far too much care and polish and money lavished upon too fragile an idea. Pitt and Jolie feint banter and attack with aplomb their movie-star wattage providing the only plausible excuse for paying attention to the shenanigans parading across the screen; when theyre old they might well think back on this moment as the time when they looked their best. But they certainly wont be able to consider it their best film. Vince Vaughn contributes some manic humor as Johns disheveled mamas boy boss a funny character conception. Everyone else comes and goes quickly. Technically pic is a dream of fabulous textural surfaces luminous locations and exquisite lighting. John Powells frisky score is augmented by a CD full of international-flavored tunes and covers.
