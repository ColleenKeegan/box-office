Plus the controversial new J.D. Salinger documentary. by Wesley Morris on September 6 2013 Riddick is the third of these Vin Diesel-in-outer space movies. The first Pitch Black was an effectively fun minor hit in 2000. The Chronicles of Riddick came out four years later. Each dipped a toe in what then had been trending at the megaplex the trouble-in-space and science fiction fantasies of the late 1990s and early 2000s (Red Planet Supernova) and the world-building mythos of The Lord of the Rings and The Matrix in the middle of the decade. Riddick hitches a ride on the last-man-alive apocalypse wagon. You watch it fully aware that Diesel would have called it I Am Legend were that title still available. As it is hes joined Charlton Heston Tom Hanks Will Smith and Tom Cruise in a genre predicated upon solitude and actor-audience intimacy. But is Vin Diesel really a star you want to be alone with? If this man is a star does he shine? Does he shine in a way that makes him worth watching when hes the only object in the sky? The first 35 minutes of Riddick dare Diesel to hold our attention as he hobbles through the muck of an interstellar outpost as he flees an assortment of computer-generated predators as he narrates the movie in funky cookie fortunes. Its a gamble and Im shocked to say that in this nonsense action-thriller-comedy it works. In part it works because after 15 years of fame Diesel doesnt want to change or grow. He remains a slab of racial ambiguity. When he speaks in movies you taste the stirred-up dust of knuckles dragged across the dirt. Diesels persona is both familiar and unknowable handsome and ugly a genius and a moron your protector and your bully. He doesnt have to try to achieve or maintain this. Charm is an alien concept If you dont like what hes offering thats your fault. In nearly every movie hes made since Saving Private Ryan hes performing cool cockiness. And Riddick wants to make the most of it. Diesel strolls around in tattered haute couture leather pants and sometimes a matching sleeveless top. His character Richard B. Riddick (or Dick Riddick? Ridick?) has been dumped on a junk planet but he could be headed to the stage at Ozzfest. I cant say beyond this that I know what the movies about since it abandons almost all of the space camp of the first two installments especially the second. All three films were written and directed by David Twohy and plotwise this one is by far the most pointless. As he navigates a way back to his home planet Riddick mopes around slays amphibious water monsters and injects himself and a hyena pup with a kind of performance-enhancing serum. At about the 35-minute mark competing bounty-hunter teams arrive for Riddicks head. All one can say to that is bwah-ha-ha. You know this movie exists only as an attempt to test the waters for Diesels complete return to non-ensemble action stardom to his xXx days because hes the only halfway-decent actor in it. This wasnt true of the other two. They had Radha Mitchell and Thandie Newton and Cole Hauser and Karl Urban. They had Keith David and Colm Feore and Linus Roache. They had Judi Dench. Riddick just has Urban for a nanosecond that reeks of ""scheduling conflict"" and briefly the singer Keri Hilson running not non-symbolically for her life. Ive never seen a Vin Diesel movie in which the other performances make his seem as if it were being presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company but here we are. Jordi Molla plays Santana one of the lead mercenaries. Its the same kind of Latin goon that American movies always ask Molla to play. His guys have names like Vargas Diaz Nunez and Luna. Some of them die easy. Diaz is played by the former wrestler Dave Bautista who gets to stay clothed and wear a dread-hawk. Santanas rival is Boss Johns whos played by Matt Nable an Australian ex-rugby star whose American accent is like a detuned radio station. His is your classic ragtag crew -- Bokeem Woodbine for instance brings the blackitude and Katee Sackhoff both ensures the arrival of Battlestar Galactica fans and demands that her butchness be taken seriously. Add dialogue that lets them all overuse variations on the word ""fuck"" then season to taste and you have armed badasses that only Alien vs. Predator could love. As it is Riddick turns into just that sort of movie a pickoff thriller. The creatures descend on the bickering mercenaries and guess who survives for a fourth installment? Twohy actually never gets you to care. The stakes are so low and the close-ups too close to savor the action. The film does strive to live up to its heros name. The late mayhem the campy assertion that lesbians arent Diesel-proof and all of Riddicks lines are ridiculous. ""There are bad days and there are legendary bad days"" he says. ""This was shaping up to be one of those."" He goes on (""The whole damn planet wanted a piece of me"") and on (""Somewhere along the way I got sloppy dulled my own edge""). If that also sounds like the rueful confessions of a lost star it probably is. In 13 years Diesels done two movies that were in any way distinct from the Fast amp; Furious films and this sci-fi series a family comedy called The Pacifier and the Sidney Lumet courtroom drama Find Me Guilty. He was bored by the former and a courageous embarrassment in the latter. But in both he was experimenting with how to be more than a guy who used to unhook velvet ropes. Diesel is 46 and contrary to what these movies promote hes funny charismatic and not made of granite. Hes spent the bulk of his career hiding in franchises hypermasculinizing himself. We can live with this. But this new movie makes you wonder whether Diesel can. The whole thing is schlocky but the first quarter is ruminatively so. Its a star telling us he knows that if he cant do better he can at least do bigger crazier fiercer and more original than Riddick that he might have a Matthew McConaughey about-face in him. Its Diesel saying that hes been selling himself way too short. He ought to be playing Riddonk. When the music never stops in a documentary -- when the interview subjects keep saying the same things and theres no clear argument being made just empty assertions speculation and a bogus premise -- you know that the movie has lost its mind. Thats Salinger crazy. It purports to show us the real J.D. Salinger not so much as the author of The Catcher in the Rye not as a compelling cultural figure not as a writer whose short stories lend themselves to close analysis and studious unpacking. The movie has a shallow paparazzo literalism. It just wants to catch the legendarily reclusive Salinger getting into a Jeep. The film directed by Shane Salerno foregoes any pretense of intellectual or journalistic rigor. Its neither a piece of criticism nor an essay of fandom. It makes talking heads of Tom Wolfe Gore Vidal A.E. Hotchner Robert Towne John Guare Martin Sheen and Philip Seymour Hoffman. It finds Salingers biographer old friends most notorious lover and one hyperventilating bookseller. Very few of these people have been called upon to think. Why do that when you can gossip? Who knows what movie Salerno told them he was making. But theyve signed on to two hours of monotonous narcissism. Salerno attempts to present Jerome David Salinger as a man wrecked by war and heartbreak to tell the story of his years as a soldier in World War II as his most formative. But he doesnt care to make sense of that part of his biography. He just skips from one aspect of Salingers life to the next and loops back around until the chronologies become as incoherent as the argument the movie claims to be making about how he came to write The Catcher in the Rye. The films pulse goes up only when the subject involves the pursuit of fame. A great deal of time is spent on Salingers obsession with being published in The New Yorker and his unhappy relationship with Oona ONeill. Occasionally one of the interview subjects perceives a link between Salingers writing and his personal life about say how his actual family had to compete with its fictional counterpart the Glasses. But the movie doesnt bear down. It focuses only on the most salacious aspects of those connections. For instance it uses old Today Show footage of Salingers daughter Margaret discussing her unhappy childhood and her shocking 2000 memoir with Katie Couric. Both Margarets book Dream Catcher and one by Salingers notorious lover Joyce Maynard (At Home in the World from 1998) aroused the fury of both the book world and those around it. Some of that contempt was a kind of paternalism How dare these women be so disloyal toward this man? Some of the contempt arose from the possessiveness Salinger awakened in his readers. In four books released in 13 years -- he stopped publishing in 1965 -- Salinger built a world of sensitivities a precious place impervious to criticism a place in which a certain kind of sentient smart being felt at home. His were the sorts of worlds that gave us emo and a filmmaker like Wes Anderson. Salinger belonged to his fans. Calling him anything less than a hero made heretics of the people he is alleged to have hurt. Salernos best angle isnt about fame but obsession -- how people stalked Salinger; how people felt Salinger licensed them to stalk (and kill); how Salinger was himself a predator of editors and young women. But no single angle in this movie stays acute for long. Its looking for dirt without being interesting in exploring how we got dirty. Look at the scene with Maynard. She goes on about her years with Salinger who in 1972 read her cover story in The New York Times Magazine (""An 18-Year-Old Looks Back on Life"") and began to write her letters. She dropped out of Yale and moved into his Cornish New Hampshire home. He was 53. She describes the hell that was living with him and the movies editing turns as breathless. Shes gossiping too. And yet what she shares goes beyond speculation. Its empirical. She knew the sides of Salinger he thought hed hid. It doesnt hurt that she knows how to appear ""on camera"" -- and her performance emotionally deepens the movie as much one can give depth to an oil slick. As a writer Salernos background is in crime (John Singletons Shaft) trash (Oliver Stones Savages) and schlock (Aliens vs. Predator Requiem). He loads the soundtrack with thriller strings and Tom Clancy-action-movie drumming. He abuses stock photography and archival footage grinding them down to filler. They dont recall a time or place. They bloat the run time. Talking heads fall like dandruff. And some like one of Salingers biographers Paul Alexander talk without contributing much insight. (Alexander speaks with a grating whine. Its his book that provides Salerno his source material.) Worst of all are the tired reenactments of ""Jerry"" smoking and banging away on a typewriter on a stage in front of a movie screen projected with Important Images. This is cheap dishonestly prurient stuff lube masquerading as polish. Salinger is also accidentally very much a movie of a moment -- the time in which we think we own our stars and feel compelled to tear them down when they disappoint us or lift them higher up when theyre under public fire. Witness how badly Dave Chappelle was treated last month on a comedy tour or the way fans of Miley Cyrus came defensively to her aid after her performance at the MTV Video Music Awards. Fans sense of betrayal as well as their capacity for over-identification are actually as old as modern fame itself. Both are just more vicious now. Salerno saves his most appalling move for the dismount. He credits two anonymous sources for giving him access to information about Salingers yet-to-be-published work. He then floods that onstage movie screen with titles and descriptions. You feel like his dream has come true He gets to be a predator too. He gets to be the Geraldo Rivera of the literary world. Salerno is arguing that Salinger owes him and by extension us. This movie is him stealing it.

By Anthony Lane In ""Wadjda"" the first full-length feature by a Saudi woman a girl longs for a bike-- the hopes of change and escape it offers.   Credit Illustration by Victo Ngai There are many ways in which ""Wadjda"" could have gone wrong. It could have been cute beyond endurance. Consider the setup a lively girl of ten or eleven an only child with a smile that can be switched on like a lamp adores her father but seldom sees him. She also knows that his gaze is drifting away from her mother with whom the girl lives a sedentary and sometimes fractious life. Put like that the tale has the sad sound of a childrens book from the days of ""A Little Princess"" and there is something antiquated in the object of our heroines desires a bicycle which she longs to possess and on which her hopes of change and escape--her only plausible ones--are pinned. The movie could also have been worthy to a fault. Written and directed by Haifaa Al Mansour it is the first full-length feature to be made by a woman from Saudi Arabia. That is long overdue and it speaks of both courage and persistence but it offers no guarantee as to the quality of the result; the world is full to bursting of bad novels and even worse poems that sprang from--and reflected upon--conditions of clampdown and woe. I know people who had the chance to see ""Wadjda"" at film festivals but skipped it fearing on the strength of its reputation that they were about to be preached at or improved. Such fear is for once misplaced. On occasion Al Mansour may have had to direct from inside a van being unable to mix with male members of the crew in public but if so the bother was worth it. From the start the film set in Riyadh is focussed on particulars. Nothing matters more for instance than shoes. At the local school most pupils wear Mary Janes but Wadjda (Waad Mohammed) as we are informed by a few efficient closeups prefers high-top sneakers with stars on them. When told to switch to black shoes she simply inks in the stars. As statements of rebellion go its not much but it counts for something when you are obliged as all the female characters are to wear the abaya in public. If you swathe your head in the niqab as well then your feet and your eyes are almost the only patches of free expression left to you. Two of Wadjdas schoolmates make so bold as to daub their toenails blue. This visual shorthand is enriched by a long shot of their headmistress the scary and stately Miss Hussa (Ahd) in which we glimpse below her hem a pair of lofty stilettos. I wondered whether Al Mansour--educated at the American University in Cairo and at film school in Australia--was remembering the nun who sports high heels in ""The Lady Vanishes."" That was a typical spike in Hitchcocks fetishistic yen but it also hinted at a dastardly plot and in ""Wadjda"" the import of the principals shoes is not lost on her charges they whisper among themselves that she has a lover. She certainly runs a tight ship. Girls are reprimanded for playing hopscotch in the yard because it puts them in sight of workmen atop a wall a hundred yards away. ""If you can see them they can see you"" the hoppers are told. And watch out for jokes; men outside the school might hear the peal of female laughter from within and that would never do. Wadjdas contemporaries are still so immature that they giggle when a teacher mentions periods and yet soon afterward we hear to our bewilderment that one of them is not just betrothed but already married; her future is locked into place. When I first saw ""Wadjda"" the pitch of this moral confinement made it seem like a prison flick. Only on second viewing did it reveal itself more precisely as the truest form of school movie. That is to say the schooling is so ingrained that it does not stop at the limits of girlhood. Grown women are governed and regimented as if they too were still in class and their individual temperaments unfurl as they try to work the system testing the rules to check how far you can bend them before they snap. Not far in the case of Wadjdas mother (Reem Abdullah). The burden of the film--and this is a tribute to a fine actress--seems to be borne in the motions of her body which more than lines of dialogue betray the tensions of a sundered soul. She is blithe even voluptuous when she sings in the kitchen or brushes her hair; she droops in a boneless despair as she stands on the rooftop having a lonely smoke; she looks radiant in a scarlet dress that she sees in a store although she has to try it on in the toilet; and she stiffens when lambasting her child for leaving the Koran open. ""The Devil may spit into it"" she says. Behind closed doors the mothers beauty unmasked is clear to behold but she seems barely aware of it or rather it concerns her solely as a tool with which to retain her husband. She cant have any more children and he desiring a male heir is thinking of acquiring a second wife. Its like living with Henry VIII. So why should such a laden movie heavy with all these cultural clues feel so light on the eye? How do you make a near-comedy from a state of permanent crisis? The bike helps. Wadjda spots it outside a shop makes the owner promise to keep it for her then sets about earning the cash to buy it. By a delicious irony her most lucrative target is a school prize awarded to the student who shows the most devotion in learning and reciting passages from the Koran. In other words Wadjda must feign orthodox goodness in her bid to be bad. For Miss Hussa the idea of a girl on wheels in a land where women are forbidden to drive is close to heresy. Wadjdas mother ventures to suggest that bike riding can harm ones chances of having children. Then there is a boy a friend of Wadjdas who begins by making fun of her--""Do you really think you could catch up with me?"" he cries pedalling off on his bike--and slowly circles round to her point of view. That strikes me as the weak spot in the tale. No boy whatever his background will risk the jibes of his pals to go and hang out with a girl. Compared with the rooted figures who surround him he seems a bit of a dream. Nevertheless ""Wadjda"" deserves its place in the canon of two-wheeled movies a slim but distinguished line gliding from De Sicas ""Bicycle Thieves"" Tatis ""Jour de Fete"" and Truffauts ""Les Mistons"" through to the Dardenne brothers ""The Kid with a Bike."" They all depend on an awkward clump of metal that has no use or purpose until it starts to move at which point especially for the young it acquires a liberating grace. Al Mansour is too smart to overdo the symbolic spin but the thrust of her film toward the end could hardly be more urgent. Wadjda winds up at an intersection watching traffic stream by in both directions. You might read the scene as a feminist renewal of ""The 400 Blows"" and of its celebrated freeze-frame at the oceans unwelcoming edge. Those of a hopeful heart will want to know where this genial striver on the brink of womanhood will head next. See ""Wadjda"" in a more sober mood on the other hand and you will ask yourself whether she can go anywhere at all. Riddick which etymologists will recognize as the Old English noun from which we derive the word ""ridiculous"" is also the name of a character played by Vin Diesel. He first appeared in ""Pitch Black"" (2000) and again four years later in ""The Chronicles of Riddick."" Now under the hand of the same director David Twohy he is back in a film simply titled ""Riddick."" The vast armies that plagued the previous movie have melted away and we find ourselves as we did at the start of the franchise in a wasteland--a sparse and hostile arena in which a handful of desperadoes tussle to survive and God willing to come out on top. Think of a Senate committee stranded in faraway space and youre almost there. Riddick is an escaped convict a combat specialist and as you can imagine an all-around sweetie pie. He has silvery eyes that can see in the dark whereas in daylight he must wear protective goggles; these are meant to signal meanness and cool but he always reminds me of an Olympic swimmer who has mislaid his Speedos. Riddick was born on the planet Furya but on this occasion he lands on another world where his only friend--and the only other character of any depth in the story despite being wholly digital--is a wild quadruped which he raises from a pup. It is one part okapi two parts jackal and three parts Pongo from ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" and it proves both loyal and helpful when a gang of human bounty hunters led by Johns (Matt Nable) come for Riddicks head. And thats it really two hours of loneliness interleaved with havoc. The dialogue has been distilled to expletives and grunts. Yet this bullish pursuit of extremity in which our hero can hardly poke a toe into a pond without being assailed by venomous water snakes has a mad momentum that tips nicely into the absurd and my one sincere complaint against the film is that Twohy failed to revive the role of Aereon a prophetic wise woman from ""The Chronicles of Riddick."" She was played by Dame Judi Dench no less and hopes were high that we might be witnessing the birth of a great screen romance. Think of the lineage Gilbert and Garbo. Tracy and Hepburn. Diesel and Dench. Wouldnt they make a lovely couple?  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Comments click to enlarge Riddick Video Rated R  119 minutes  2013 In the third installment of this sci-fi franchise Vin Diesel returns as the titular intergalactic convict whose vision is impaired by day but crystal clear by night. This time around Diesel finds himself stranded on a barren monster-filled planet after being double-crossed by former allies; when dueling teams of bounty hunters come looking for him he hatches a plan to commandeer one of their ships. Director David Twohy (A Perfect Getaway) draws from a wealth of inspiration--his most obvious influences include Howard Hawkss macho actioners and Walter Hills sur-westerns--but he never commits to any particular viewpoint. Instead were treated to a vibrant stylistic mishmash that works brilliantly in chunks but is ultimately too scattered to sustain any cohesion. Not exactly a good film though a fascinating one.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Dont discount the appeal of a B movie thats in it for the down-and-dirty fun minus the philosophical windbagging. Such a movie is Riddick an alternately kick-ass and clumsy piece of sci-fi claptrap that puts its empty head down and gets the job done. Vin Diesel a graduate of the block-of-concrete school of dramatic arts is back as the titular anti-hero an ex-con being tracked across galaxies by bounty hunters. I say that Diesel is back because hes played Riddick before in 2000s Pitch Black (not bad) and in 2004s The Chronicles of Riddick (very bad). Why has it taken nearly a decade to get Diesel into Riddick gear again? Well it takes time building a career out of playing street racer Dominic Toretto in dozens of Fast and Furious films (Im exaggerating the number but not by much). To be fair Diesel has tried acting twice--in 2000s Boiler Room (not bad) and 2006s Find Me Guilty (also not bad). But the money is clearly with Diesel in badass mode and speaking in a voice that sounds like he gargles with gravel. Thats Riddick baby. The movie looks made on the cheap but David Twohy who directed them all gives the first half hour an elemental drive. Riddick abandoned on a rainy lifeless planet is put upon by mud demons and various other creepy crawlies until the arrival of two bounty hunters Santana (Jordi Molla) and Johns (Matt Nable). Thats when things turn from propulsive to achingly predictable. Too bad. Riddick had me going there for a while effectively killing time until it killed my patience.

Its only due to star Vin Diesels renewed box office clout (via the ""Fast amp; Furious"" movies) that we have this third entry titled like a modest re-introduction and struggling to get back to what was good about the first film. Once again the anti-hero is stranded on an isolated planet populated by alien jackals slavering giant scorpion thingies and two teams of bounty hunters who he picks off one by one. The movies cheap but has a sense of humor and its smart enough to let Riddick just get back to being a badass. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

Riddick Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2013) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/riddick-2013,200,riddick6,riddick,rogerebert
"Riddick | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; riddick ) Riddick (United States/United Kingdom 2013) September 06 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Even after nine years you cant keep a good man down. The indomitable protagonist of 2000s surprisingly engaging Pitch Black and 2004s disappointing The Chronicles of Riddick is back for his third go-around and if the open-endedness of the narrative is a clue it wont be his last. Both writer/director David Twohy and star Vin Diesel are invested in Riddick so it wont take more than a modest box office success to start the counter on a fourth film. Riddick works as a stand-alone in that it doesnt demand indoctrination but those possessing some degree of familiarity with the life and times of the title character will get more out of this movie. The introduction hearkens back to The Chronicles of Riddick and one of the antagonists has a familial link to someone from Pitch Black. Riddick is neatly divided into three acts each slightly less successful than its predecessor. The first and best part of the movie follows our broken and bleeding anti-hero (Vin Diesel) after hes marooned on a planet that could best be described as ""unfriendly."" Those familiar with Discovery Channels survival shows will recognize the vibe. Riddicks aesthetic especially as presented in this segment is arresting (with lots of golds and browns and a genuinely alien and foreboding landscape) and theres at least one image that looks like a Frank Frazetta painting come to life. For 30 minutes this is all about Riddick surviving on his own in a hostile environment where the ""dogs"" are maneaters and theyre some of the nicer creatures around. Act two occurs after Riddick sets off a distress beacon. Bounty hunters arrive. There are eleven of them in total but only a few merit mention the greedy Santana (Jordi Molla) who wants to put Riddicks head in a box; the no-nonsense Johns (Matt Nable) who wants the outlaw captured alive so he can be questioned; and Johns right-hand woman Dahl (Katee Sackhoff) who repeatedly makes it clear to Santana that his advances arent appreciated. The rest of the bounty hunters fill the role of the screaming non-virgin teenagers in slasher films. Like in a science fiction First Blood the better armed more numerous guys venture into Riddicks territory and find themselves unprepared for whats waiting for them. By the time we get to the final 30 minutes Riddick starts to get a little stale so the film ups the ante by forcing the survivors to band together against an alien menace. This segment might have worked better if it had been given more time to breathe and develop but with the two hour mark looming Twohy feels the need to wrap things up so he rushes through Riddicks final act. Much of the film is over-the-top but that wont be a surprise to those who saw the previous two installments. Diesel is in fine form growling his lines and being the most menacing person on screen even when hes in chains. The success of the Fast amp; Furious franchise has elevated Diesels profile sufficiently to warrant Universals investment in the film although at less than 40 million Riddick doesnt have to do much at the box office to be profitable. Its also worth noting that Twohy gets a lot of bang for his buck. For the most part this is a great looking film and although there are a few dodgy special effects scenes (especially the one in which hunters on the futuristic bikes are seen zipping across the terrain) this is as no less impressive than the average mega-budget summer spectacle. Riddick is a closer cousin to Pitch Black than to The Chronicles of Riddick. Its a dark tense motion picture and its humor (of which there is a fair amount) is of the gallows variety. Riddicks systematic elimination of the bounty hunters recalls not only Rambos activities in First Blood but also the methods of killers in horror films. In this case however were asked to identify with the one doing the murdering. Its a matter of who has the moral code. Riddick may be an outlaw but he lives by a set of precepts. Those hunting him while working within the framework of intergalactic law are driven by greed and self-interest. While Riddick is unquestionably Diesels film there are some nice supporting performances. Jordi Molla is the kind of generic sadist whose comeuppance becomes one of the films most anticipated moments. Matt Nable brings a sense of emotional conflict and near-nobility to his part. Katee Sackoff whos known to sci-fi fans as ""Starbuck"" from the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica is the embodiment of a strong female character. Put her alongside Linda Hamiltons Sarah Connor and Sigourney Weavers Ripley. Like Hamilton and Weaver Sackoff bulked up for the part. Riddick isnt perfect but its a good high-octane sci-fi tinged action/thriller. The pacing issues dont derail the production and there are numerous memorable scenes sprinkled throughout. Those who enjoyed Pitch Black but found The Chronicles of Riddick to be a step in the wrong direction will find that Riddick takes viewers back to the things that worked in the first installment without being a repeat remake or reboot.

"Riddick (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Riddick (R) Vin Diesel reprises his role of intergalactic outlaw in this dull bloated sequel. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/5/2013 Editor rating 1 Riddick aka The Sequel Nobody Wanted gets off to a surprisingly strong start. The eponymous anti-hero (Vin Diesel) an intergalactic outlaw with the ability to see in the dark is stranded on a desert planet with no weapons or supplies seriously wounded and relentlessly hunted by carnivorous aliens. There are scary dog-like predators that look like a cross between dingos hyenas and zebras. There are fearsome scorpion-like monsters that lure their prey with canny intelligence. There are other creatures circling high overhead but Riddick cant fly so those arent as much of a problem. Relying primarily on visuals with a spackling of voiceover narration to help ease viewers into the movie writer-director David Twohy creates a survival drama that constantly raises the stakes on Riddick then finds a plausible way to extricate him from each cliff-hanger. But there are early signs of trouble too. A flashback explaining how Riddick wound up on this inhospitable rock does away with the entirety of The Chronicles of Riddick in two minutes (and makes suckers out of anyone who paid to see that film). When Riddick traps a dingo-thing pup and tames it the animal which has the wide eyes of a Walt Disney character becomes such a precocious and playful creature that I kept waiting for Riddick to name it Marley.(Riddick also manages to somehow teach the beast English since he can say ""Bring me my reserves"" and the adorable hyena-thing understands exactly what he means). Then the plot kicks in and Riddick starts to fall apart. Two packs of bounty hunters come looking for Riddick who is wanted across the galaxy preferably dead. The killers are all B-movie stock types. There is the calm authoritative one (Matt Nable) who doesnt want to kill Riddick only to speak to him about something. There is the Hispanic hothead (Jordi Molla) who is prone to constant hissy fits and speaks with such a thick Spanish accent that you wish his scenes had subtitles. There is the attractive butch lesbian (Battlestar Galacticas Katee Sackhoff) who is just as tough as any of the guys and also likes to take showers. There is the black one (Bokeem Woodbine) who serves no discernible purpose other than to prove African-Americans exist in the future too. There is the religious one (Nolan Gerard Funk) who is constantly breaking out into prayer when he should be wielding a gun instead. Diesel disappears from the movie for a dangerously long stretch while his would-be hunters bicker and argue and trade insults adding nothing to the films ridiculously bloated running time (two hours) except irritation. Unlike good science fiction Riddick doesnt have a single intriguing idea or concept. The movie which sports loads of cheesy-looking CGI effects simply co-opts the genre for tiresome formulas (who will survive?) that arent all that different from the Friday the 13th pictures. Eventually Diesel re-enters the fray and Riddick becomes a shameless rip-off of Aliens as well as a preposterous cartoon that makes The Amazing Spider-Man seem like an Errol Morris documentary. Twohy pulls off an effective set piece now and then (theres a terrific scene involving the opening of a lock that may or may not be booby-trapped) and there are some undeniably powerful images too. But the entire movie bears the whiff of a vanity project -- a modestly budgeted bone Universal Pictures threw at Diesel so he would keep starring in Fast and Furious pictures.

Half-an-hour in though I realized it didnt matter. The filmmakers didnt remember much of it either. And I was going to forget all about this one too once it was over. If I was lucky. If you need your own refresher course the character first appeared on screen 13 years ago in ""Pitch Black"" played by Vin Diesel the knockaround knockoff Sly Stallone. Riddicks a Furyan the last survivor of an ancient race. Hes also a violent ex-con and able to see in the dark. Whatever B-movie charms that first film had though were quickly lost in ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" the 2004 sequel that dropped the character into an ersatz sword-and-sandals epic full of silly names -- Behold Crematoria Beware the Necromongers -- and bad computer effects. ""Riddick"" like its title gets back to basics simply rehashing the plot of the first film. Our antihero is about to be taken off to justice by some bounty hunters. Then a real evil arrives. Time to form some strategic alliances and let the human villain loose at least for a little while. Its the film though that remains handcuffed. The early part of the story -- with Riddick waking up alone stranded on an unfriendly planet -- is taut enough but hampered by flagrantly unreal effects and Diesels punch-drunk narration. Theres a a very quick confusing flashback to the last film -- an excuse I guess to get Karl Urbans name in the credits -- and then the supposed ""good guys"" arrive to haul Riddick away. Except of course compared to this criminal theyre really bad guys. Also mostly bad actors. Oh Jordi Molla smacks on some scenery as the head bounty hunter and its nice to see Bokeem Woodbine in the mix. But the rest of Diesels co-stars are all madly forgettable nobodies shouting their carefully memorized lines and leaving no fingerprints on the film at all. Meanwhile director David Twohy -- who began his Hollywood career decades ago as a writer -- has yet to develop any visual sense. The dark palette and extreme close-ups turn every fight into a muddy blur; the staging which should feel claustrophobic is too often set in vast (and unconvincing) landscapes. And through it all lumbers the impassive Diesel overstuffed and leathery like some La-Z-Boy come to fitful life. He was never a gifted actor but at least he occasionally used to try; there was some real presence to his shark-suited trader in ""Boiler Room"" and doing the drama ""Find Me Guilty"" was a big if foolhardy gamble. Now though hes strictly an action hero -- and so greedy a star that one silly franchise apparently isnt enough. He needs two. Well sorry Vin -- and dont get furious -- but stick to the fast cars. Unlike Riddick I cant see in the dark. But at the screening I went to -- lit by the smartphone screens of yawning fans checking their texts -- it was still pretty obvious that this series has run out of gas. Ratings note The film contains gory action strong language and violent sexual situations. Riddick (R) Universal (119 min.) Directed by David Twohy. With Vin Diesel.

Rated R (graphic violence profanity nudity sexual references). At the Lincoln Square the Empire the Kips Bay others. Memo to movie bad guys Never vow to put Vin Diesels head in a box. He may take umbrage. And consider the practicalities How do you saw off the cranium of a man with no neck? Even if you could youd need a forklift to move it around. In ""Riddick"" that Diesel head (like a flexed triceps) and that Diesel voice (the exhaust pipe of a Harley) prove well-matched to writer-director David Twohys unashamed B-movie vision. This is the rare sci-fi actioner that doesnt rush to bore you with its views on global warming class divisions or immigration; at no point does Jodie Foster wander in trying to sound European. In the third entry in the series that began in 2000 with the surprise low-budget hit ""Pitch Black"" and continued with the expensive 2004 flop ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" Diesels cunning survivor Richard Riddick is (again) the wronged ex-soldier stranded alone on a merciless planet as bounty hunters prowl the galaxy for him. Hes wanted dead or alive but preferably dead. Wandering alone Riddick inoculates himself against the venom of the planets vicious pincer-mouthed serpents and domesticates a jackal-like beast that becomes a stalwart guardian. Twohy has an enticing patience that allows you to get accustomed to Riddicks world and the methodical ways he copes with it. These quiet slow-developing scenes stand in delightful contrast to say the frantic cutting and hunger for explosions of the tiresome ""Iron Man 3."" That ""Riddick"" was made on more of a Tinfoil Man budget works very much to its advantage. Its like an early-70s Charlton Heston sci-fi movie that has to function as a story because it cant afford bombast. And when the gangs of bounty hunters show up -- one led by a swaggering Spanish jerk named Santana (a highly amusing Jordi Molla) the other by Johns (Matt Nable) the militarily efficient father of Riddicks enemy from the first movie -- the testosterone sprays off the screen. You may have to punch someone on your way out of the theater just to relieve the manly ache of pent-up aggression. The competing teams of bounty hunters squabble among themselves with Santana threatens rape in the general direction of the lesbian cutie Dahl (Katee Sackhoff) who almost regretfully kicks his ass. Riddick (who can see in the dark) could be anywhere they tell one another unaware hes perched right on top of their ship. In a cleverly executed piece of misdirection Twohy wrings tension out of a potential explosion that segues beautifully into the hunters realization that Riddick has stolen the initiative. The somewhat hokey Edgar Rice Burroughs atmosphere (with production design touches from ""Alien"" and ""Road Warrior"") is made cool with Riddicks cynical sometimes funny Raymond Chandler narration (a big improvement over those stuffy and declarative Heston lines). The movie actually winds up being engagingly chatty with insults flying in the interludes between the cheaply done effects sequences. That CGI can be laughably bad -- a shot of the men on flying choppers looks so pasted-together it could have been on an old kiddie show like ""Land of the Lost."" But cheap effects are forgivable if youre engaged in the story and for me the two hours went by quickly. I do wish the last 20 minutes hadnt been mired in murk (another way to cheat when the money isnt there) but whats more important is the story errors -- the pincer monsters suddenly become way too easy to kill and Riddick is a passive figure at a climactic moment his survival dependent on others. Still the movie jogs along nicely without ever getting a case of the stupids; far from being a bloated ""John Carter"" its just a pared-down yarn of survival ""Die Hard"" on a planet.

(Associated Press) Vin Diesel plays Riddick a loner an ex-convict and a stone-cold killer.(Associated Press) Riddick sci-fi schlock thats worth the price of admission Add to ... Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 06 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 06 2013 1201AM EDT Comments AA Directed by David Twohy Written by David Twohy Starring Vin Diese Katee Sackhoff Classification 14A Genre action Year 2013 Country USA Language English The quickest and easiest way to humanize an unlikeable movie character is to give him a lovable dog and so it goes with Riddick. The eponymous protagonist of David Twohys science-fiction thriller is a loner an ex-convict and a stone-cold killer. All of which would be an impediment toward audience identification were it not for the fact that five minutes into the movie he adopts - okay kidnaps - a hybrid hyena-wolf puppy and makes it his new best friend. Multimedia Riddick The official trailer Keira Knightley arrives for the film premiere of ""Can a Song Save Your Life?"" at the 38th Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto September 7 2013. REUTERS Multimedia Read em rate em sort em The Globe guide to 100-plus TIFF 2013 movies Multimedia Fast amp; Furious 6 The official trailer Misery loves company after all and as Riddick opens its namesake is as miserable as he has been at any point in his own personal trilogy of films dating back to 2000s Pitch Black. When last we left Vin Diesels bald-pated badass he had been inadvertently crowned the king of a planet full of military fanatics but governance wasnt the big guys strong suit. Rudely deposed and summarily deposited on a dusty desert planet crawling with deadly indigenous creatures hes forced into survival mode.The first 30 minutes of Riddick play a little bit like an intergalactic gloss on Cast Away methodically chronicling one mans lonely pitched battle against an unfriendly habitat. These passages are compelling enough that its almost disappointing when a team of bounty hunters touches down to collect the price on Riddicks head The pace slackens and the coiled silent tension of the opening sequences gets replaced by lots of profane meathead banter. But Twohy an expert genre filmmaker whose brilliant 2009 critical favourite A Perfect Getaway was an exercise in narrative sleight of hand knows exactly what hes doing. After getting up close and personal with Riddick for the films first act he transforms him into a lurking peripheral presence for most of this extended middle section - a predator picking off his well-armed adversaries one by one.The most refreshing thing about Riddick is how low the storys stakes are. The fate of humanity never hangs in the balance; the question is how this borderline sociopath is going to kill off the equally unlikeable jerks who have been dispatched to place his skull in a box. In lieu of blockbuster spectacle Twohy spins wittily choreographed scenes of small-scale carnage most of it initiated by Riddick himself. Diesels work here is the flip side to his avuncular car thief in the Fast and Furious franchise. There he plays a decent guy who keeps getting reluctantly pulled back into criminal activities; by contrast Riddick is so comfortable rooting around in the darkness that his only stumbles come when he chooses to lighten up.It barely matters that none of the other actors can match Diesels offhand magnetism since the whole point of Riddick is that its protagonist is double-tough enough to fend off monsters and mercenaries all by himself (or with a little help from that feisty CGI dog). Its obvious that Twohy a veteran sci-fi director who has always written his own scripts identifies with his iconoclastic anti-hero and if theres something a little creepy about the valorization of a villain it also comes as an antidote to the goody two-shoes attitudes in The Lone Ranger and Man of Steel. Nasty brutish and maybe a little bit too long at nearly two hours Riddick is finally a curious cinematic delicacy a deliciously tasteless slab of pure B-grade pulp.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Vin Diesel in a scene from ""Riddick"" a Universal Pictures release. (AP) By Stephanie Merry September 5 2013 Follow stephmerry Twelve years after bringing the grunting crazy-eyed and muscle-bound Riddick to life in the sci-fi thriller ""Pitch Black"" Vin Diesel reunites with director David Twohy for a third installment a more complicated film with a simple title ""Riddick."" As the movie opens Riddick an escaped convict with silvery eyes and permanent night vision finds himself stuck on a foreign planet where hes been left for dead by one of his many enemies. Riddick is horribly injured with a compound fracture but it turns out one of his many talents is DIY medicine. He makes himself a cast using just armor and nails which he screws into his own leg. Grotesque as it is the scene is a mere amuse-bouche for the bloodshed to come. The planet is a doozy with maniacal dogs and giant scorpions but Riddick has a keen sense of survival so he makes a nice little life for himself and his new pet a killer puppy. But deep down Riddick just wants to return to his home planet of Furya. Knowing he has a bounty on his head he broadcasts his whereabouts to lure mercenaries whose ship he plans to steal. Sure enough two competing groups land and start their hunt. The first is led by an idiotic hothead named Santana (Jordi Molla) whose comeuppance is all but ensured by his arrogance. The other team falls under the more likable Johns (Matt Nable) whose motives are mysterious. He is more interested in talking to Riddick than killing him and collecting a reward. What ensues is a movie thats more about these two groups than about the title character. Riddick sets off a game of cat-and-mouse only there are two cats and the mouse remains in the shadows. Riddick must be unacquainted with Occams Razor -- the idea that the right solution is usually the simplest one -- because he solves problems in the most elaborate ways possible. There is solid evidence he could dispatch his attackers while bound and blindfolded but Riddick prefers to create intricate scenarios. He may not be in a huge rush to get home after all. ""Riddick"" can be cheesy and silly not to mention excessively violent but its also fun. The story moves quickly along and even when the outcome is plain the journey remains entertaining. Diesel looks like an oaf but makes for a winning anti-hero. Its almost enough to make you wonder what he could accomplish if he stopped reprising the same roles again and again in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise not to mention this series. Regardless this probably isnt the last well see of Riddick. Riddick 1/2 (119 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for language sex nudity violence and gore. lifestyle style true Please provide a valid email address.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 646 p.m. EDT September 5 2013Vin Diesel reprises his vapid thug role in this third in a series.Vin Diesel once again plays a sci-fi anti-hero in the title role of Riddick.(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Vin Diesel Karl Urban Katee Sackhoff David BautistaRated R; Runtime 1 hour 59 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideMove along theres nothing to see and no one to root for in this murky franchise reboot.If only audiences like the title character in Riddick ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) were equipped with luminescent extra-vision eyeballs. Then it might be possible to muddle through the dark and incoherent action scenes. But to the ordinary naked eye characters and landscape look bathed in dusty milk chocolate. Its often impossible to tell whos fighting whom or whos been devoured by a space alien. Not that its really worth pondering.Not only is this third installment in the series tedious grisly and inane its star Vin Diesel plays a ridiculous amalgam in the title role. Hes a killing machine with a heart of gold a malevolent mush-ball who plays fetch with alien critters.STORY Vin Diesel is powered by Riddick passionREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersThe first half-hour is dialogue-free as Riddick left for dead on a dusty wasteland of a planet tromps around on sepia-toned scorched earth dodging slithery eels snarling zebra/dingo hybrids and venomous giant scorpions. Hes something of a murderous medicine man fixing his broken leg by screwing armor into his flesh. Hes all brawn and can-do ingenuity. But then he speaks. Audiences will long for the silence of the opening scenes. Diesel is more adept at glowering and flexing his muscles than at dialogue. His thudding monotone does nothing for the vacuous voice-over narration which he punctuates with grunts and growls.The most appealing character is a feral zebra/dingo pup that Riddick befriends. Their escapades are substantially more entertaining than the suspense-free action scenes.At least Dame Judi Dench had the good sense to sit this one out. She co-starred in 2004s The Chronicles of Riddick the sequel to the first in the series 2000s Pitch Black.What there is of a story is wince-worthy. Riddick is a wanted killer banished to an inhospitable planet. All he wants is to return home. He sends out an emergency beacon hoping to snare a ship. But mercenaries are hot on his trail. And hes worth more dead than alive.Those in pursuit -- 11 of them but whos counting -- are about as one-dimensional as the title character. Its a holiday for cliched action-movie characters Theres trash-talking Santana (Jordi Molla) innocent young Bible-thumper Luna (Nolan Gerard Funk) fatherly commander Boss Johns (Matt Nable) and tough babe Dahl (Katee Sackhoff).No one is memorable but Santana is clearly the worst of the lot constantly harassing Dahl blurting out homophobic insults and cracking rape jokes. Riddick also makes inappropriate sexual comments to Dahl. Following a voyeuristic episode he comments that her nipples are the same color as her toenail polish. Yet somehow were meant to find his overtures charmingly macho.The video-game quality and adolescent obsessions of this futuristic action movie are unmistakable though the movie devolves into a slasher flick.Riddicks computer-generated pet dingo -- who has no name-o -- is the best actor of the lot. 132 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 20 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/17BH0vNFall Movies Calendar SeptemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this September.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A space-age criminal and his pursuers are stranded on a hostile planet. Rated R (violence gore nudity language) BOTTOM LINE Diesels dormant sci-fi franchise gets jolted back to life by this smart funny entertaining action flick. CAST Vin Diesel Jordi Molla Matt Nable Katee Sackhoff LENGTH 159 There are few things as pleasurable as high-quality pulp and ""Riddick"" starring Vin Diesel as humanoid ex-convict Richard B. Riddick fits the bill. Its B-grade cinema made with A-level intelligence and imagination -- skillfully directed surprisingly well acted and gratifyingly preposterous. Its the third installment in a sci-fi franchise that began promisingly with 2000s ""Pitch Black"" but got derailed by two things. One was the 2001 hot-rod flick ""The Fast and the Furious"" which launched a successful series that stole Diesel away. The other was 2004s ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" a toned-down space fantasy that was poorly received. The title of ""Riddick"" suggests a reintroduction and writer-director David Twohy the man behind all three movies seems thrilled to be back in the game. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Granted he takes a while to get things warmed up. After a lengthy flashback to the previous story line (a distant kingdom a nefarious betrayal) and some corny noirish narration (""How did I let them blindside me like that?"") ""Riddick"" finally gets down to brutal business. It begins as a man-versus-nature story with Riddick traversing a hostile planet full of freaky CGI creatures. Things get complicated when two teams of bounty hunters begin competing for Riddicks head. And wouldnt you know it -- a looming storm may force everyone to join forces. ""Riddick"" repeats many a beat (and scene and line) from the first film but there are several improvements. Diesel mixes vulnerability into his machismo -- he at least winces while hand drilling screws into his shinbones -- which makes him more likable and less predictable. Hes supported by a colorful crackling cast including Jordi Molla (""Colombiana"") as the unscrupulous Santana and Katee Sackhoff (Sci Fis ""Battlestar Galactica"") as a hard-hitting hottie named -- what else? -- Dahl. Whats more the special effects can be startlingly good. Riddicks alien-jackal companion a combination of puppetry and computer animation seems so alive that he should have shared top billing. 237 MoviesRiddick trailer ""Riddick"" has plenty of flaws but theres something refreshing about a genre flick that isnt winking at itself (like say ""Iron Man"") or trying to be profound (like ""Elysium""). ""Riddick"" is dead serious about being ridiculously entertaining. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT A space-age criminal and his pursuers are stranded on a hostile planet.

THE GODFATHER PART III (1990) -- Francis Ford Coppola for years nixed offers to do a follow-up to 1974s ""The Godfather Part II."" But he was still hurting financially from his 1982 flop ""One From the Heart"" when Paramount made him an offer he couldnt refuse -- 5 million plus 15 percent of the gross a 4 million loan and total creative control. TERMINATOR 3 RISE OF THE MACHINES (2003) -- A sequel to 1991s ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" had long been proposed but director James Cameron wanted no part of it.

"Riddick 3 stars Article Things to do >> Movies >> Article Riddick 3 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Riddick Fair 3 stars Director David Twohy.Cast Vin Diesel Karl Urban Katee Sackhoff.Rating R for strong violence language and some sexual content/nudity. RELATED NEWS A rough road back to Riddick for Vin Diesel By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Sep 5 2013 155 PM At 46 action star Vin Diesel remains cut. But his 13-year-old Richard B. Riddick franchise has gotten pretty thick around the middle. Not that ""Riddick"" didnt try to get in shape for the occasion. This second sequel in an unlikely franchise cut a lot of fat scaling back from the unwieldy space opera of ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" and marooning Diesels ripped feral convict on a hostile desert planet. Theres a requisite bit of catch-up in the beginning courtesy of a sloppy intro sequence that gets the audience up to speed on our heros current plight. And then its like the goofiest-ever episode of ""Man vs. Wild"" sci-fi edition with Riddick setting his own broken bones inuring himself to deadly venom and making friends with the native predators (and occasionally cuddling a CGI puppy). Its all strangely endearing until the bounty hunters show up in pursuit of Riddicks head. Riddicks at his most fun when the pressures on and he retreats to plan something special for his new visitors. All the build-up pays off with tense showdowns in the dark thrilling restraint and ominous suggestion giving way to slasher gore. But in the meantime Riddick all but disappears from the narrative sticking the audience with a band of interchangeably dull meatheads and their loathsome leader Santana (Jordi Molla). And though Katee Sackhoff (of ""Battlestar Galactica"" fame) is always a welcome sight her lesbian-sniper character is woefully underused reduced to a smirking victim of rape threats. Its unfortunate because shes the only one with a personality you could pick out of a crowd. It takes a certain amount of brains to play dumb fun right and ""Riddick"" infrequently shows that spark of self-aware wit. Action sequences are carried out with lavish and welcome brutality and Diesel plays his growling convict with gleeful macho bluster. But those moments are brief bursts in this overlong popcorn flick marooning viewers in vast wastelands of interminably dull dialogue and plodding plot progression. ""Riddick"" aims much lower than the stars and still doesnt quite hit its target. But when you consider a summer overstuffed with disappointing prestige pics that cost the GDP of several island nations to produce ""Riddicks"" more modest (and less expensive) stumbling doesnt seem so bad in comparison.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Richard B. Riddick the protagonist of David Twohys 2000 sleeper Pitch Black has spawned an unlikely franchise. Like a cross between Donald E. Westlakes Parker and a panther (with a little Conan The Barbarian thrown in for good measure) Riddick roams a vast sci-fi universe of bounty hunters and backstabbers surviving on predatory instinct. The first 30 minutes of Riddick find Twohys antihero--played as always by Vin Diesel--dragging himself across a desolate digital matte landscape sleeping in caves and beating back scavengers with shards of animal bone. Aside from a flashback and some typically noir-ish narration this opening stretch of the film is wordless; visually and tonally it brings to mind Paul W.S. Andersons underrated Kurt Russell space Western Soldier. Left for dead on a hostile planet Diesel reverts to a nocturnal animal. After months of hunting he comes across an abandoned mercenary outpost and activates its distress beacon setting a trap with himself as the bait. At exactly the 30-minute mark Twohy a reliably surefooted storyteller executes a complete change in perspective. As rival space crews--lead by Jordi Molla and Matt Nable--arrive Diesel turns from protagonist to bump-in-the-night monster remaining largely offscreen for the middle third of the film. His presence is felt through gruesome traps and menacing graffiti on the outpost walls. At one point a bounty hunters flashlight catches him dragging a mangled body back to his lair like fresh prey. Twohys best work--from Pitch Black and A Perfect Getaway to the underrated WWII horror movie Below--displays a love for self-contained genre stories and Riddick is no exception; despite being the third feature in a series that also includes an animated movie and two games its essentially a stand-alone film a survival story that pits a group of trigger-happy opportunists against a man who refuses to pretend that hes anything more than an animal. Pitched somewhere between hard-boiled space pulp (a lesbian character saying ""I dont fuck guys but occasionally I fuck em up"" is typical of Twohys banter) and black comedy its a largely amoral movie though its amorality is less an attitude than a method for telling a good yarn. (A lengthy sequence where the bounty hunters try to use logic to figure out whether Diesel might have booby-trapped their storage locker is an object lesson in how to use unlikable characters to build comic suspense.) What matters above all however is that Twohy has the pulpy visual chops to match his storytelling. Images of Diesel drunkenly sitting on a metal throne fighting a tentacled monster in a cave or scampering up a jutting rock during a rainstorm play like Tor paperback covers brought to life. In an era of high-falutin tentpole sci-fi theres something to be said for a filmmaker still devoted to crafting plain old genre pleasures.

AP Universal Pictures Posted 523pm on Thursday Sep. 05 2013 Thursday Sep. 05 2013 Thursday Sep. 05 2013 R (strong violence strong language sexual content/nudity); 119 min.The lack of imagination in Riddick the third installment in director/writer David Twohys increasingly forgettable sci-fi franchise is so stunning that its almost like a special effect in itself. In fact if they handed out awards for dull action-movie cliches witless sexist jokes leaden pacing and tiring CGI then Twohy better start writing his acceptance speech now.After the overblown Chronicles of Riddick Twohy was supposedly going to go back to the lean simplicity that made the first Riddick film Pitch Black in 2000 a cool little cinematic calling card.That film starred Vin Diesel as an escaped convict fighting to stay alive on a planet of hungry predators.Now Riddick finds himself dumped on a hostile slab of rock after leaving Helion Prime the planet at the center of a power grab in the Chronicles of Riddick fighting to stay alive against attacks from vicious canines and giant lizard-scorpion-crocodile creatures.But theres a bounty on Riddicks head and two teams of competing bounty hunters show up to claim their prize. One is led by Santana (a campy Jordi Molla Colombiana) and the other by Boss Johns (Matt Nable) the father of one of the men in Pitch Black who believes Riddick is responsible for his sons death. Of course Riddick single-handedly can outsmart them all.This could have made for an entertaining cat-and-mouse game but theres little fresh in the films action/fight scenes or the writing (the f-word is thrown around enough to make Quentin Tarantino say ""what the heck?""). And none of these characters is particularly intriguing. Brawny yet boring Diesel is especially inert. The one who comes closest -- Dahl (Katee Sackhoff Battlestar Galactica) as Johns no-nonsense and openly gay second-in-command -- is treated to a litany of lines that basically say that what she needs is a man.Its supposed to be funny but its not.The films most intriguing element is the casting of Nable an Australian Aboriginal actor in the role of Johns a rarity in a big-budget Hollywood production. (But a better vehicle for the former rugby player is the Aussie crime series Underbelly Badness currently airing on DirecTV in the U.S.). The Riddick character has become so popular that he continues his adventures in several video games. Thats a good thing especially if that means Twohy -- whose last film was the enjoyably breezy thriller A Perfect Getaway -- can finally stop making movies about him. -- Cary Darling Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

(Jan Thijs) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 5 2013 140 PM Title Riddick Film Info R Violence language. Area theaters. Theres no expiration date for movie characters. But there are certainly some who if they went missing wed never even notice. Like Vin Diesels title character in ""Riddick."" Hes been gone from the screen for nine years. The grunting muscled tough guy from the planet Furya debuted in 2000s ""Pitch Black"" and returned in 2004s ""Chronicles of Riddick"" accompanied by noted action babe Judi Dench. Hes now returned only to have most moviegoers say ""Yeah and ...?"" It seems Riddick has been buried on a desolate planet for much of that time. Most of the first half hour of this new film is nearly silent with Riddick battling the elements and facing down fierce CGI creatures alone. Hes like a Hemingway character only you know dumber. In voiceover he mumbles semi-coherent thoughts like ""There are bad days and there are legendary bad days. This was one of those."" Riddick follows up on the story developed in Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick. Its a legendary bad day because Riddicks taming of strange hyena-dingoes and fighting mud serpents is interrupted by two separate teams of bounty hunters. Theyre responding to a beacon Riddick sets off in an abandoned outpost. By coincidence both teams are hunting Riddick the alien convict whose only power is that his glowing eyes help him see well in the dark. Thats one of the dullest powers an alien has had since Uncle Martin could speed people up on TVs ""My Favorite Martian."" Writer-director David Twohy who was behind Riddicks two previous flicks focuses on the sweaty miscreants allowing Riddick to stalk in the shadows until he lets himself be captured by someone with a connection to ""Pitch Black."" Even if you care what his connection is youll still be disappointed by how its played out. Vin Diesel faces down CGI terror in Riddick. ""Played out"" is certainly the operative phrase here. Diesel who has a much more lucrative and satisfying franchise going with the ""Fast amp; Furious"" films gives one of the most soporific action performances ever. When Riddick is trussed up and suddenly starts speaking crudely to the one female bounty hunter named Dahl (Katee Sackhoff of ""24"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"") its jarring though its meant to be jokey. The same goes for the B-movie special effects though the reddish-yellow sand grows on you. The story feels like quicksand. ""Riddick"" which couldnt even qualify for proper summer movie placement moves like Martian molasses and cant present an action scene to save its life. Youll wish you had Uncle Martins ability to speed people -- not to mention awful movies -- up.

"Riddick movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Riddick Diesel-powered cheesy fun September 06 2013|Michael PhillipsVin Diesel reprises his role as the antihero Riddick--a dangerous escaped convict wanted by every bounty hunter in the known galaxy--in ""Riddick"" the latest chapter of the saga that began with the sci-fi film ""Pitch Black"". (Universal Studios/Handout)From the dusty annals of a science-fiction franchise belonging to another age that of ""Pitch Black"" (2000) and ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" (2004) and several video game variations heres a modestly scaled summer picture continuing the legend that time and many moviegoers forgot. And its fun Extremely violent cleverly managed fun full of eviscerating aliens Vin Diesel making those little swimmer goggles look sharp and Katee Sackhoff of ""Battlestar Galactica"" swaggering around as a sexually ambiguous bounty hunter stuck with a bunch of guys on a crummy planet ruled (more or less) by the escaped prisoner Riddick whose story is recapped in ""Riddick"" but theres not much to it dont worry.This is not one of those Johnny-come-lately sequels preoccupied with getting a new audience up to speed on where the story was. Its about living in the moment in the now and killing in the now.The character name Riddick has a twee sprightly air two adjectives which do not bring Vin Diesel to mind. But hes the one taking care of his adversaries in a plot line recalling Agatha Christies ""And Then There Were None"" except here its ""And Then There Was Vin.""And heres the beauty part to the extent writer-director David Twohys simple compact movie can be called beautiful The bounty hunters are all individuals and you actually care about some of them so its not simply a ""Saw""-type grinder of a movie wherein we wonder how the next side of beef is going to get sliced. I mean we do wonder that but there are other things going on.""Riddick"" opens with a near-wordless sequence set on a hot scrubby planet where our antihero betrayed by the Necromongers -- there thats it done with the plot summary -- is left for dead among the winged beasts and slithering giant scorpion- and fanged squid-like denizens of the swamps. The opening half-hour of Twohys picture is a grabber a chronicle of Riddick dealing with the swamp things and his domestication of a dingo-type alien jackal dog. The occasional voice-over (""Whole damn planet wanted a piece of me"") reminds us that Riddick can in fact speak if needed.Then come the bounty hunters some old some new and ""Riddick"" turns into a different picture one that scrambles your sympathies nicely as Riddick squares off against the meanest of them while everyone contends with ace creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos alien animal kingdom. The movie is worth seeing simply for the ace-of-spades-shaped ears on the heros pet dingo.The first halfs more compelling than the second; the flying effects with zippy hovercrafts look cheeseball; and the whole of ""Riddick"" smacks of being filmed in GreenScreenLand which it was. (And Montreal.) More persuasively than the recent ""After Earth"" and ""Oblivion"" ""Riddick"" makes an entertaining survival-guide virtue of its main characters isolation. The side characters all get their share of profane zingers. The audience came away sated. In the 13 years since the first Riddick chronicle Diesel has discovered what it means to be a certain kind of movie star working hard but not too serving material that here does what its supposed to do.mjphillipstribune.com""Riddick"" - 3 starsMPAA rating R (for strong violence language and some sexual content/nudity)Running time 159Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesChronicles of Riddick charts same old spaceJune 11 2004Riddick leaves audience in the darkJune 11 2004Sci-fi `Pitch Black Just A Mishmash Of Bits From Other...February 18 2000(New releases) ""ELF"" Will...November 14 2004Find More Stories AboutMovie StarVin DieselRiddickTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0905-riddick-20130906,0,4508162.column",200,riddick21,riddick,chicagotribune

Riddick--Dick to his friends if he had any--is an intergalactic meathead whos glowered through three movies two video games and a cartoon. Hes both the luckiest and unluckiest man alive lucky because hes impossible to kill unlucky because everyone keeps trying. In the opening near-silent sequence of Riddick the laconic sequel to 2004s overblown schlock opera The Chronicles of Riddick our hero (Vin Diesel) is nearly slain by a space vulture a space hyena and several space eels. ""There are bad days and then there are legendary bad days"" he growls. Eh in his earlier flicks hes already survived an asteroid accident nocturnal monsters some baddies called the Necromongers a broiling sun a subterranean prison and a front-row seat for Dame Judi Denchs most regrettable role as an Air Elemental named Aereon. On his scale a killer space eel is just an excuse for sushi. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Pitch Black the first Riddick flick is guilty of launching Diesels career. Its a curious accomplishment. Diesel has managed to steer one of the most solid franchises in contemporary Hollywood (not this one if you have to ask) despite being the oddest movie star since Danny DeVito. A man made from two potatoes and a nose Diesel is a charismatic lump whom the camera flattens into mush. When allowed to smile his movies make 786 million. Yet most directors--including three-time Riddick helmer David Twohy--mistakenly equate macho with monotone forcing him to spend the film lumbering around with his lips pursed like a peevish librarian.To further handicap Diesels acting Riddick is saddled with CGI night-vision eyes that are as capable of emotion as two blue marbles. And when the sun is up which in this adobe-baked landscape is most of the time his eyes are so sensitive that he hides them with goofy goggles that combined with his broad shoulders and shaved scalp make him look like the universes most bitchin diver.Film Details Riddick RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time119 More Info Trailer Stripped of eyes and mouth Diesel has nothing to act with but his fists. Luckily he doesnt have to bother. After Chronicles flopped Twohy rightly realized that audiences dont care about Riddicks backstory. If you dodged the first two movies heres all you need to know Riddick is a wanted killer in search of his home planet Furya. His current location a planet he calls Not Furya. (Curiosity isnt his strong suit.) To escape Riddick reveals his location to a global network of bounty hunters--here mercenaries are as commonplace as pizza deliverymen--and waits until he and some other bad things can kill off enough of his would-be killers to steal their ship.

Sep. 13 600pm However instead of one ship he gets two a vessel captained by the morally ambiguous Boss Johns (Matt Nable) and a second led by the Spanish rogue Santana (Jordi Molla) who loves fancy swords and sneering the word ""puto."" Wait--were on a planet with seven-foot space scorpions but Spain still exists? If that makes your head explode just pretend that in this universe planet names are just mistranslations of places on Earth. ""Furya"" is really Alienese for the Jersey Shore which explains both Riddicks wife-beater and why our Snooki is half-Ewok.Its murderer versus murderers with Riddick facing off against 11 bounty hunters who include a tremulous Christian (Nolan Gerard Funk) a badass lesbian (Katee Sackhoff) and a giant (wrestler Dave Bautista whos like The Rock with a 90s goatee). The only reason to root for Riddick is that his name is on the ticket stub. But hes so dull and the hunters so weird that were literally cheering for the movie to kill off its personality one throat slash at a time.Instead we must pan for scraps of pleasure--an MRE ration labeled Crab Enchilada Hash a scene where Diesel poses naked on a cliff like a truck stop coyote the way half of his attacks look like rhythmic gymnastics--while trying not to get so riled up by all the rape jokes that we spin around and stab our seatmate. Alas poor Sackhoff. Nothing says Strong Female Character like a savage babe who spends most of the film getting sexually harassed. Havent these guys seen how handy she is with a sniper rifle?Theres a swagger in Riddicks simplicity. With only two or three actual plot points and a whole lot of padding Twohy has room for a five-minute gag about an exploding locker or an extended sequence where Riddick trains a space puppy. Pared down to the action movie essentials--a gun a grunt and a flash of boob--its like an R-rated kids book where were just supposed to grok the grisly pictures.

"Riddicks return a fun action-packed ride review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRiddicks return a fun action-packed ride reviewThe third installment in the Riddick series entitled simply Riddick delivers plenty of action and cool CGI along with a classic deadpan Vin Diesel Vin Diesel in a scene from Riddick.  (AP)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Sept. 5 2013RiddickStarring Vin Diesel Matt Nable Katee Sackhoff. Co-written and directed by David Twohy. 119 minutes.Right down to the pared down title the third instalment of the adventures of Richard B. Riddick returns to the basics.For those whove waited almost a decade for the ever-wanted fugitive killers return that will come as welcome news.Article Continued Below""I dont know how many times Ive been crossed off the list and left for dead"" growls Riddick in the introductory voice-over.This time Riddick has been dropped from a lofty height both literally and figuratively. Hes deposed as Lord Marshal of the Necromongers a title he assumed at the close of the second instalment The Chronicles of Riddick (2004) and unceremoniously dumped and left grievously wounded on a sere yellow planet inhabited by an array of unfriendly fauna.Finding an abandoned station he scans himself and sends out a distress call knowing hell find plenty of willing rescuers in the bounty hunters whove been trying to collect on him for a long time. Riddick is nothing if not resourceful.But its not just the ""mercs"" -- thats with a hard c -- Riddick has to battle as the rains bring a new menace.Co-writer/director David Twohy has wisely chosen to return Riddick to a story more akin in structure and style to Pitch Black (2000) the first instalment in the series and the best of the three.There are several references -- including word for word dialogue -- in Riddick that harken back to Pitch Black. The bounty on his head the first time around was double if brought back alive. This time its double if hes brought back dead.Theres also the character of Boss Johns (played by Matt Nable) who shows up not to claim the price on Riddicks head but to learn from the horses mouth what happened to his edgy morphine-addicted bounty hunter son William Johns (Cole Hauser).Amidst all the testosterone all three films feature at least one kick-ass female character and this one is no exception. This time her name is Dahl (played by Katee Sackhoff) and shes nearly as memorable as Pitch Blacks reluctant acting captain Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell).Vin Diesel once again imbues Riddick with his trademark deadpan style and as usual it works. The classic loner we see a little bit of his softer side when he adopts a pet informally known as a dingo-dongo. Good luck to the guy who messes with his dog.While most of the ""mercs"" are eminently disposable Jordi Molla attacks the role of the nasty Santana with particular relish and watch for his particularly memorable comeuppance.The CGI-created landscape is impressively rendered and detailed there are loads of cool gadgetry and of course plenty of action and ""ghosting"" i.e. killing.Will Riddick ever manage to make it back to his home world of Furya? Twohy leaves the door open by films end and fans of Riddick will be more than pleased to go along for the ride for any future adventures.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Riddick (Vin Diesel) cant catch a break. When we last saw our predatory Furyan antihero in 2004s The Chronicles of Riddick hed accidentally assumed leadership of the Necromongers alien beings out to convert the universe to their walking-dead religion. Monarchical rule doesnt really suit this basso-voiced loner so he ends up betrayed and abandoned on a sunburnt planet where two rival teams of bounty hunters (""mercs"") are out for his head and vicious lizard creatures are plentiful. First things first though--namely a terrific mostly dialogue-free 20-minute opening during which Riddick acclimates to his new surroundings. Finally writer-director David Twohy manages a sustained sense of space-operatic poetry that eluded him in the bombastic Chronicles and the seriess derivative first installment Pitch Black (2000). Watching this see-in-the-dark muscleman brooding against gorgeous otherworldly vistas all while crafting pointy homemade weapons and befriending a scene-stealing CGI canine (no joke) is a sci-fi aficionados delight. Once the film introduces the mercs however things settle into an all-too-familiar groove. Twohy replays the group-under-siege dynamics of Pitch Black mostly upping the quotient of steroidal taunts and gore (theres an admittedly delightful gag involving a machete a box and half a severed head). Battlestar Galacticas Katee Sackhoff fares best as the mannish gal of the group while Jordi Mollas obsessive psycho annoys with every archly macho line reading (""This sucks ass and swallows""). Riddick gets pushed to the periphery for so long that its a relief when he and the mercs team up for a wondrously frenzied climax featuring toothy alien beasties subwoofer-shattering thunderclaps and a mountainside spiritual epiphany that would make Mosess jaw drop. Give Twohy credit; he nearly succeeds in turning Diesels franchisable action figure into a mythical Siegfried.

(Universal) C+ Riddick Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Vin Diesel Katee Sackhoff Karl Urban; Director David Twohy; Release Date Wide 09/06/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 119; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Universal Classics Posted September 19 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT At a time when the budgets for sci-fi films are like the universe itself expanding at an astronomical rate Riddick decides to go small. The franchises third entry shrinks back from the baroque byzantine space opera of 2004s The Chronicles of Riddick placing Vin Diesels interstellar criminal in a story thats more similar in scope to the series first film the smart and stylish Pitch Black (2000). Abandoned on a sere hostile planet the laconic antihero subsists off the meager landscape like a muscle-bound Robinson Crusoe until an ensemble of bounty hunters and soldiers (including Battlestar Galacticas Katee Sackhoff) arrive looking to put his head -- with those superpowered see-in-the-dark eyes -- in a box. Riddick co-written and directed by David Twohy scavenges a variety of genres for parts morphing over the course of its run time from survival story to slasher film (as Riddick hunts his hunters one by one) to a climactic Aliens-esque siege by slithery slavering creatures. Twohy succeeds in staging moments both tense and funny but theyre fewer and farther between than one would hope and the dialogue is served up with a heaping helping of cheese especially when delivered in Diesels low-frequency growl. Still by aiming more for suspense than bombast the modest intentions of this threequel make its failures appear more modest as well.

Sign up for our Newsletters. Daily Edition Login to download Riddick Film Review 900 AM PDT 9/4/2013 by Justin Lowe FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Faithful to the template if not the spirit of previous installments this flabby second sequel barely manages to advance Riddicks considerable personal mythology. TWITTER Vin Diesel returns to vanquish murderous thugs and lethal creatures alike in the third episode of the epic sci-fi franchise again directed by David Twohy. By now the saga of escaped convict and galactic outlaw Richard Riddick is a well-established sci-fi benchmark with a devoted following cultivated by a succession of movie DVD and video game releases. As the substantial lore surrounding Riddick aspires to achieve mythic proportions expectations also escalate challenging successive releases to augment the gritty antiheros legendary status particularly after the first sequel budget-bloated The Chronicles of Riddick stumbled in 2004. Succinctly titling the third film Riddick would seem to telegraph a determinative evolution of the ongoing narrative rather than the largely episodic exercise that franchise director David Twohy and star-producer Vin Diesel have delivered. Although there are still plenty of Riddick adherents out there opening weekend response could be somewhat muted considering the nine-year lapse since the last movie and the noticeably more restrained style of the follow-up. But the franchises fanbase will almost certainly provide a significant bump with the release of home-entertainment formats. VIDEO Riddick Trailer Vin Diesel Fends Off Alien Onslaught Duped into relinquishing the crown of Lord Marshal of the Necromongers by his nemesis Vaako (Karl Urban) an entitlement hard-won in The Chronicles of Riddick the notorious murderer Riddick (Diesel) ends up stranded on another blisteringly inhospitable planet instead of enjoying a return to his home world of Furya as Vaako led him to expect. Fending off attacks by hyena-like wild canines and battling carnivorous amphibians reminiscent of giant scorpions Riddick makes it out of the heat-blasted desert to the sanctuary of the adjacent high plains where he finds refuge in an outpost set up by a network of galactic mercenaries. Relative safety turns out to be unrewarding however and with no other way to escape the inhospitable planet Riddick activates the beacon device that alerts an extensive bounty-hunter network to his location. First to arrive from off-world are Santana (Jordi Molla) and his thuggish cohorts who collectively possess more brawn than brains. Close behind Boss Johns (Matt Nable) pilots a better-skilled crew that includes crack sniper Dahl (Katee Sackhoff) the only woman among the testosterone-fueled hunters. Riddicks intention as he makes clear in a message spelled out in a bloody scrawl inside the shelter after his pursuers arrive is to separate one of the spaceships from its crew and flee. Santana however is determined to sever Riddicks head from his body so he can claim the bounty particularly since its doubled if the fugitive is confirmed dead. Vastly outnumbered and out-armed Riddick has only the weapons hes improvised with -- materials harvested from the local flora and fauna along with a fierce native canine hes managed to semi-domesticate -- to fend off the mercenaries and make a break for freedom. STORY Vin Diesel Hopes to Relaunch a Franchise With Riddick Significantly dialing back on Chronicles sprawling scale the latest installment feels tentative even at a flabby 120 minutes more like a placeholder that barely advances the considerable Riddick mythology. Playing it safe with a script that offers Riddick up as a lone avenging hero Twohy passes on the opportunity to effectively shade the characters distinctive dimensionality. Plenty of bone crunching and blood gushing along with some selective nudity have boosted the movies rating up to an ""R"" but lacking the distinctive visual style robust production design and planet-hopping pace of its predecessor Riddick feels mired in stasis. While Chronicles was a full-blown space opera the current iteration is beset by unremarkable CGI effects and tethered to limited locations. Twohy maintains skillful command of the franchises Frank Frazetta-inspired imagery and pulp sci-fi narrative template throughout but its all more deliberate than imaginative. Fortunately Riddick is as indomitable and unrelenting as ever but even Diesels gruff charisma cant do much to animate the first 30 minutes of the movie which drag as Riddick struggles to survive on the unfamiliar planet. The legendary convicts badassery is already well known across the galaxy making his repetitive victories over the elements and marauding alien carnivores almost entirely dispensable. Absent any other intelligent life forms Riddicks brief monologues and terse comments to his canine companion hardly make for much character conflict. Once the bounty hunters turn up en masse though Riddick reverts to form delivering wisecracking warnings and kicking butt while barely breaking a sweat. Although its clear almost from the start that smarmy machete-wielding Santana is no match for Riddick Johns cautious efficient demeanor suggests he may have an actual strategy to corner his prey. As dueling antagonists they spend as much time bickering as they do confronting Riddick. Mollas performance is particularly cartoonish and even borderline comical in contrast to Nables firm-jawed determination. Most of the other characters are nearly interchangeable heavily armed thugs with only Sackhoffs buff no-nonsense turn as Johns loyal ice-queen sniper attracting much notice. Inevitably setting up another sequel at the movies conclusion Twohy begs the question of where a wanted man with a price on his head whos exiled from his home planet can really run for sanctuary. Regardless Riddick has little time or goodwill to waste if the franchise is to manage a satisfying coherent conclusion.

Having been left for dead in more ways than one after the critical and commercial failure of 2004s ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" Vin Diesels futuristic fugitive Richard B. Riddick gets his lean mean R-rated mojo back for ""Riddick"" an improbable but very enjoyable sequel that recaptures much of the stripped-down intensity of Diesel and director David Twohys franchise starter ""Pitch Black"" (while treating ""Chronicles"" like the dream season of ""Dallas""). Once again pitting Diesels eponymous anti-hero against human and alien adversaries on a rugged desert planet this exuberantly gory chase pic wont orbit the same box office galaxy as the stars ""Fast amp; Furious"" series but will have no trouble recouping its reported 38 million budget (one-third the cost of ""Chronicles"").This story first appeared in the September 10 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. In an image that can be seen as a metaphor for the entire Riddick franchise the new film opens with Diesel emerging from under a pile of boulders and resetting a badly broken leg -- the old-fashioned way. And for most of the fairly terrific 30 minutes that follow ""Riddick"" resembles nothing so much as an outer-space remake of the 1966 Cornel Wilde adventure ""The Naked Prey"" with Diesel on the run from all manner of carnivorous creatures including ""alien jackals"" that look like the offspring of a zebra and a pit bull. (Riddick even manages to domesticate one which becomes a surprisingly endearing companion.) You can see here why it has been the actors long-held dream project to star in a film about Hannibal crossing the Alps. In one of few acknowledgments that the events of the bloated ""Dune""-like ""Chronicles"" even happened a brief flashback explains that Riddick -- having at the end of that film been crowned ""Lord Marshal"" of a band of religious fanatics known as Necromongers (dont ask) -- quickly tired of the despot life and struck out in search of his long-lost home planet Furya. Instead he ended up here a planet identified only as ""not Furya"" betrayed by his escorts and left to fend for himself. It doesnt take long for Riddicks trademark light-sensitive eyes to discern that hes not alone -- in addition to the aforementioned jackals the place is positively swarming with fanged slithery ""mud demons"" who take to water the way the winged hammer-headed beasties of ""Pitch Black"" took to the night. And wouldnt you just know it Out there on the horizon a big old storm is brewing. Thats bad news for Riddick but even worse news for the two rival teams of bounty hunters (or ""mercs"" in Riddick-speak) who have latterly landed on the planet in search of the man who remains one of the universes most wanted. One such group is led by Santana (the excellent Jordi Molla) a reckless firebrand in the Tony Montana mold while the other is captained by Johns (Matt Nable) a no-nonsense mercenary whose name will instantly ring a bell to the ""Pitch Black"" faithful. Indeed for him Riddick isnt just another bounty; hes a personal vendetta. That sets the stage for what is effectively a sleeker more accomplished but no less enjoyable ""Pitch Black"" remake with rain substituted for darkness and Riddick and his would-be captors once again forced to work together -- or at least pretend to -- if they want to make it off Not Furya alive. And if nothing in ""Riddick"" ever quite tops that opening act when it seems as though the entire movie might be a solo Diesel performance piece even at its most conventional this is a solid unpretentious B-movie entertainment of the sort John Carpenter was regularly turning out in the 1980s and 90s populated by the kind of snub-nosed men (and women) of action favored by Carpenters own professed idol Howard Hawks. To wit Riddick nearly meets his match here in the form of Johns second-in-command the steely ass-kicking Dahl (""Battlestar Galactica"" star Katee Sackhoff) who succinctly summarizes her character in two lines of dialogue ""I dont fuck guys. Occasionally I fuck them up if they need it."" Twohy who has become a markedly more confident filmmaker with each successive movie (his last was the ingeniously twisty tropical noir ""A Perfect Getaway"") has a grand old time setting the action against matte-painted vistas that recall many a 1960s space opera and framing it all in spare deep-focus widescreen compositions. (The cinematography is by David Eggby who shot ""Pitch Black"" as well as the original ""Mad Max"" a key visual reference here.) And where ""Chronicles"" overdosed on cartoonish CGI ""Riddick"" returns to the ""Pitch Black"" formula of mixing animated elements with practical effects and puppetry creating a tactile otherworldly environment that ranges from the sets to the props to the creatures (designed by the great Patrick Tatopoulos) themselves. Throughout Diesel cuts a most imposing figure surprisingly lithe despite his bulk and with an acerbic wit that keeps things light without ever approaching the cutesy. He is a most unusual movie star -- or maybe the herald along with his sometimes co-star the Rock of a new breed of movie star -- with his shiny bald pate Barry White basso profondo and indeterminate ethnicity. But the camera unmistakably loves him -- and judging from the cheers that erupted at the screening attended from the mere presence of his name in the opening credits so does the audience.

Reply eva says September 8 2013 at 431 pm Vin Diesel has a loyal following of fans who like any movie that hes in. Im one of those but I also like sci-fi and this is true sci-fi transporting the viewer to a difference place and time in the universe where someone of heroic proportion fights heartless blood sucking slime. Riddick is more complex than many critics and movie goers apparently can see. I believe he is good at his core and has become hard and harsh as a result of ruthless environments and human and alien monsters. Its good to see a little bit of evil blown away every now and again. Blood shed and bad language are nowhere near as obscene as are so-called ""reality shows"" or self-serving politicians to name a few evils of these times.

His ""for thems"" look a like his ""for mes"" with the added unexpected gloss of a Magic The Gathering playing card. ""Riddick"" marks Diesels third quest as his space cadet antihero and with the help of series writer/director David Twohy the star rolls a natural 20 for full nerd advantage. Diesel cashes in all of the ""Fast amp; Furious"" chips here steering his passion franchise away from the mainstream with a hybrid of Damp;D adventuring ""Pitch Black""-style close quarters mayhem and a dash of ""Heavy Metal"" for spice. Dan OBannons grungy low-budget nightmares run amok in ""Riddick"" which never settles on a single story to tell while still stuffing a great deal of fun down our throats. ""Riddick"" is a fractured skeleton of a script with each distinct installment scratching its own itch. Part one plays like ""Gerry"" with Richard B. Riddick (yes thats his full name) taking the place of two aimless hikers and the ""Dune"" planet Arrakis swapping in for Death Valley. After the muddled events of 2004s ""Chronicles of Riddick"" (which you remember as well as ""Empire Strikes Back"" right?) Riddick finds himself stranded on a sandy wasteland fending off creepy crawlers and rejected designs from ""Avatar."" Shockingly the mostly-silent prelude is ""Riddicks"" best material. Diesel carries the weight of the methodical CG-assisted world-building like Atlas; hes more human in a single frame of ""Riddick"" than in all of ""Furious 6."" Voiceover pulled straight from the overly-poetic spoken word intros of discount rack rap albums dampens the physical force Diesel manages to display against manufactured backdrops but his charm clobbers through. ""Riddick"" is a star vehicle for a star Hollywood forgot it had. Riddicks cross-plains trek leads him to an abandoned supply facility -- the perfect opportunity to alert a universe of bounty hunters of his current location. In hopes of seizing a spaceship Riddick divulges his whereabouts spurring the supporting cast to come aflockin. Two factions arrive First slimy scumbug Santana (Jordi Molla) and his Sergio Leone-esque gangster squad; Second a military unit comprised of by-the-books Boss Johns (Matt Nable) and his second-in-command Dahl (Katee Sackhoff). As the two clash outside the futuristic cantina Riddick hides in the shadows picking them off one by one. Twohy swiftly pans the spotlight away from his hero for the main thrust of ""Riddick"" scaling down the concept art landscapes into a practical cagematch of B-cinema mayhem. If only the ensemble held a candle to Diesel who lurks away from the action while the soldiers implode. These are shades of characters grating when Twohy takes the easiest paths imaginable to shade them. Bautistia is the liveliest of the bunch adding wit to an otherwise meager cast (promising for those looking forward to Marvels ""Guardians of the Galaxy""). Sackhoff inevitably injects Dahl with brute strength but rarely does she escape the gravitational pull of the eye candy role. And along with being incompetent Santana finds time during his hunt for Riddick to sexually molest Dahl who plainly states early on that she favors women over men (""I dont fk guys but I do occasionally fk them up""). The misogynistic stupidity could be overlooked if it werent for Riddicks inclusion later; when hes eventually taken in by the gang he makes the sly remark that hell be ""balls deep"" in Dahl soon enough. What is likely a nod to sci-fis grand tradition of gratuitous sex chatter falls completely flat in ""Riddick."" Uncomfortably so. When Diesel does reenter the picture at the hour-thirty mark -- evoking more ""Heavy Metal"" comparisons ""Riddick"" feels like a segmented anthology film -- the actor cranks his gusto for running jumping slashing and smirking to 11. Twohy gives him all the room to play throwing a mix of animated and puppet monsters at his feet as tribute to Hollywoods God of War. Perhaps TV sci-fi special effects have trained this eye but ""Riddicks"" CG alien designs blended with dusk skies and the right amount of rain (take note ""Pacific Rim"") dazzle. When major blockbusters are spending 300 million to throw everything at the screen Twohy and Diesel fill their frames with an economical amount of weird. Diesels hope for a sprawling mythology stand in the way of ""Riddick"" being a sizzling sci-fi escapade. Turns out when it comes to the blind gruff renegade the smaller the adventure the better. A summer of high-adrenaline action pics may have us wishing for more from ""Riddick"" but any aversion to the slow and steady pacing of the film is likely the resulting aftermath of a non-stop roller coaster ride. Diesel would tell you that wall-to-wall action isnt the style for any Damp;D game and its not the approach that maximizes the ""Riddick"" formula to its fullest potential. Hes right.

The Chronicles of Riddick (2004) was a misfire placing our hero at the centre of a tedious Dune-like intergalactic conflict. Now unheralded comes Riddick a return to the Vin-kills-slimy-things template of the first movie. In parts its almost a remake the only difference being that these nasties come out in the rain rather than the dark. Theres a whole lot of previously-on-Riddick backstory to get through - a gang of bald chaps with names like Lord Siberius Vaako tried to bump him off apparently - before we reach the meat of the story. When we do its flavourless the aliens are unscary and easily despatched Vins too silent to be interesting and the other characters - a gang of bounty hunters on Riddicks trail - are either dull or offensive Katee Sackhoffs lesbian character appears to exist purely so the male characters can threaten to rape her.

All the elements of parody are here Ridiculous first-person narration that quickly disappears an adorable but deadly canine sidekick ridiculous macho posturing under- and over-acting of inane dialogue (by director David Twohy) and laughably artificial matte backgrounds and special effects. Were it not for the eviscerations and the rough language this could be a segment on a Nickelodeon sketch comedy show. Also read Comic-Con 2013 Vin Diesel Feels Guilty About Playing Violent Riddick After the horrible reviews of ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" one wouldnt imagine that Vin Diesels bad-ass super-alien would make it back for a third appearance -- the character first turned up in the leaner meaner ""Pitch Black"" -- but Universal apparently wants to keep him happy between ""Fast and the Furious"" installments so were back in outer space once again. If nothing else someone obviously learned after the disastrous ""Chronicles"" that this character doesnt lend himself to overblown storytelling and an intricate backstory. The one thing that ""Riddick"" does right is to strip things down to a basic cat-and-mouse manhunt tale almost like a remake of ""Predator"" in which Predator is the hero and the pesky human hunters are the bad guys. We dispense with the ""Chronicles"" stuff early on -- Riddick is betrayed by Karl Urban and his guyliner and finds himself stranded on the Planet of Fakey Backdrops and Hungry Carnivores. In no time hes made himself invulnerable to the venom of the local scorpion-lizard-manta beasts and domesticated one of the planets dingo-raptor animals into a traveling companion. Also read How The Conjuring Propelled Director James Wan From Torture Porn to Vin Diesel Finding an abandoned bounty hunter outpost Riddick deploys the homing beacon knowing that it will reveal his location to any number of mercenaries hungry for the reward on him. (The captor gets a double prize for bringing back Riddick dead.) The first team to arrive is a scurvy bunch led by Santana (played by too-good-for-this Spanish actor Jordi Molla) but his group is soon joined by a second team whose commander Boss Johns (Matt Nable) has his own reasons for wanting to hunt down Riddick. Riddicks plan is to steal one of the ships and kill anyone who gets in his way which leads to an extended segment of psyching out his pursuers and picking off the actors with the worst agents. The upside to this is that Diesel is off the screen for significant portions of time -- because really his CG irises out-act him throughout the film -- but the downside is that the bounty hunters are two-dimensional and hackneyed even the ones played by reasonably competent performers like Katee Sackhoff Nolan Gerard Funk (""The Canyons"") and Bokeem Woodbine. If ""Riddick"" had managed to inject any thrills or pleasure or wit or excitement into what is a pure genre exercise then its excesses and lapses could be easily overlooked. But this just isnt any fun when fun was all it ever had to be. Vin Diesel has found a perfect niche for himself in the increasingly delirious and entertaining ""Fast and the Furious"" series. If ""Riddick"" is the best he can come up with in his off-hours both he and the audience would be better served if he took up macrame instead. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
