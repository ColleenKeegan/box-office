Often it seemed as if the more portentous and metaphysical the Serling fanfare the more the episode was guaranteed to be some piece of schlock about a plastic monster living inside the basement wall. I thought back to those bottom-drawer episodes when I saw Wes Craven Presents They. (The hilarious diminuendo of that title is such that the movie might as well have been called ""Wes Craven Presents Not a Hell of a Lot."") Were told about demons that bring on ""night terrors"" and the movie in a lame attempt to conjure the power of suggestion keeps the malevolent batlike thingies off camera except for a few what-was-that? flashes accompanied by an icky jellied smacking on the soundtrack that signifies the anticipated masticating of bodily organs. In this case however the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show. Serling his bushy eyebrows knitting until they just about touched his chin might have described the monsters in ""They"" as ""an emanation from a cold dark place - that city of the mind known as Nightmare Town."" To anyone else they will look like an underlit emanation of chintzy F/X in search of a real movie.

""They"" go bump in the night the monsters in the closet the things that hide under the bed the shadows that move across bedroom walls. ""They"" are every 6-year-olds night terrors made manifest. But ""They""ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering from director Robert Harmon. Who and what are ""They""? ""They"" go bump in the night the monsters in the closet the things that hide under the bed the shadows that move across bedroom walls. ""They"" are every 6-year-olds night terrors made manifest. But ""They""ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering from director Robert Harmon whose debut film ""The Hitcher"" set a high bar for screen terror in the 1980s. Stuffed inconspicuously into a crowded Thanksgiving frame after several earlier aborted release dates pic looks like a holiday gobbler. ""They"" arrives on a tide of expectations. Film marks Harmons return to the suspense genre for the first time since ""The Hitcher"" and is the latest release from Miramaxs Dimension arm which has been the only Hollywood studio steadily devoted to horror/fantasy product for some years now. Opening with a wonderfully imaginative bit of nighttime-scare creepiness -a petrified tyke begging for the solace of his parents bedroom when Prosutian magic lantern images appear on the wall and something shifts about in a closet -- ""They"" quickly goes off track. Nineteen years later psychology student Julia (Laura Regan who resembles a blond Hillary Swank) is having sex with her paramedic boyfriend (Marc Blucas in a particularly thankless role) when they are interrupted by her childhood friend Billy (the good Jon Abrahams). Billy insists they meet right away. They do in an all-night diner and the petrified Billy babbles incoherently about something that is out to get him before blowing his brains out all over Julia. At Billys funeral Julia meets other friends who like Billy and Julia all experienced night terrors as young children and are now beginning to experience them again. One by one they find a strange mark appearing on their bodies. Soon its the proverbial race against time as Julia attempts to crack the mystery before she becomes a victim while everyone around her -- in the most tired horror-movie fashion -- starts to think that shes crazy. Julia and her branded brethren however seem intent on making it ever so easy for those demons to catch them They creep down dark staircases alone crawl into air ducts and do just about everything else the audience knows theyre not supposed to do in a horror movie. Harmons atmospheric direction has set piece quality particularly during an encounter on a moonlit stretch of deserted highway in which the imagery achieves a pop-up-storybook shimmer. But despite a lengthy homage to ""Cat People"" -- one of pics best scenes -- ""Theys"" m.o. is closer to William Castle than Val Lewton. Additionally Brendan William Hoods screenplay lacks originality. ""They"" takes the premise of Stephen Kings ""It"" borrows a bit from David Twohys ""Pitch Black"" and incorporates the suspenseless subway car finale of Guillermo Del Toros ""Mimic"" while never making much internal sense. Theres also a more-than-passing resemblance to Wes Cravens venerable ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise which may explain the prominent ""Wes Craven Presents"" credit at the end of the film and in advertisements (pics title card reads simply ""They""). By the time creature-effects maestro Patrick Tatopoulos grasshopper-like monsters take center stage most viewers wont be scared and some will have forsaken this turkey for their own turkey leftovers at home.

Starring Laura Regan and Dagmara Dominczyk. Directed by Robert Harmon. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The alternative title for ""They"" is ""Wes Craven Presents They "" which could lead the naive among us to believe that ""They"" is a Wes Craven picture. Its not. He didnt write it direct it or produce it. He is just ""presenting it"" kind of the way Ed Sullivan introduced the Beatles. All Sullivan did in that example was point and say here they are. Thats a far cry from actually singing ""She loves you yeah yeah yeah."" What Craven has chosen to point out for us turns out to be a perfectly acceptable perfectly bland competently acted but by no means scary horror movie in which ""they"" are coming to get people. They are coming in the dark because the dark so were told opens a doorway between our world and theirs. What is their world? We dont know and we never find out. But we do know ""they"" are not nice individuals. The picture which slipped into theaters Monday without any advance screening stars Laura Regan as Julia a young woman finishing her masters in psychology. As a child she had a history of night terrors and the terrors come back again after a friend goes mad and kills himself. Before he does he tells her that unseen creatures in the dark are coming after him and will soon be coming after her. This is inconvenient especially given the fact that she has to defend her thesis that very week. The opening minutes set up the formula that the rest of the movie will follow. Julia has a series of episodes of escalating terror in which she is frightened out of her mind. At first she tries to deny their reality and later she cant. Soon everyone thinks shes crazy saying things like ""Yes I know thats right but first you need to rest"" -- meanwhile the last thing Julia needs is to be alone in a dark room. Thats when ""they"" prefer to show up. In ""They"" we never see the creatures but we know from their outlines that theyre big and insectlike. They click when they move and roar when they eat. We know the horror-movie gobble sound. Weve seen this movie before and so has Wes Craven who has made a few of them and mocked them too with his ""Scream"" movies. Why Craven should want to attach his name to this film is more mysterious than anything in it. Were living in an age of horror films that are all about unconscious terrors made manifest. This has been the case for 20 years. (Old horror films by contrast such as ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"" were often about metaphysical concerns.) In ""They"" the creatures might exist or they might be a metaphor for encroaching madness. Julia is worried about being swallowed up and taken out of this world literally but her problem could just as easily be mental with the dreaded fate being just as dire in any case Complete alienation in a world of demons with no hope of outside contact. Perhaps Craven was attracted by the metaphor of monsters and mental illness but the metaphor is old and director Robert Harmon does nothing to make it seem new again. Or perhaps Craven was just captivated by the movies last and best scene which is spooky enough to make ""They"" almost worth seeing. . This film contains horror movie violence.
