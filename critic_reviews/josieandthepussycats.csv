Comments Josie and the Pussycats Rated PG  95 minutes This self-styled self-reflexive comedy asks the question just how stupid are teenagers? Marketed to them as if its mission were to expose the ways other media products are designed mainly to take their (and their parents) money the insultingly trendy post-postmodern tale rationalizes its own product placement by using overkill--the Target logo is ingeniously integrated into so much of the production design its impossible to distinguish the abstract from the referential. The plot turns naturally on a scheme to encode in hit music tracks subliminal suggestions about what listeners ought to buy--its an expose of the mundane in which the title band discovers its been signed mainly to stimulate teen spending. The subliminal suggestion ""Do not see this movie"" is hidden somewhere in this review. Written and directed by Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont based on characters from Archie comics. With Rachael Leigh Cook Tara Reid and Rosario Dawson.

Sensationally exuberant imaginatively crafted and intoxicatingly clever ""Josie and the Pussycats"" shrewdly recycles a trifling curio of 1970s pop-culture kitsch as the linchpin for a freewheeling candy-colored swirl of adventure hijinks and prickly satirical barbs. This is one sharp pussycat. Sensationally exuberant imaginatively crafted and intoxicatingly clever ""Josie and the Pussycats"" shrewdly recycles a trifling curio of 1970s pop-culture kitsch as the linchpin for a freewheeling candy-colored swirl of comicbook adventure girl-power hijinks and prickly satirical barbs. Though clearly aimed at an under-25 female demographic pic has sufficient across-the-board appeal to be a crossover hit and should earn a kit and caboodle of cash before lapping up greater riches in ancillary markets. While remaining reasonably faithful to the spirit of two short-lived (16 episodes each) but much-rerun TV cartoon shows -- ""Josie and the Pussycats"" (1970) and ""Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space"" (1972) -- which in turn were inspired by a popular Archie Comics series writers-directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont (""Cant Hardly Wait"") have slightly expanded the central characters and significantly altered the overall tone. As before the three leads -- plucky singer-guitarist Josie McCoy (Rachael Leigh Cook) ditzy blond drummer Melody Valentine (Tara Reid) and levelheaded bassist Valerie Brown (Rosario Dawson) -- are the hard-rocking members of a girl group. In this version however theyre introduced as an unknown garage band not a successful touring act. And instead of battling diabolical villains in Aztec pyramids or criminal masterminds near the Grand Canyon Josie and the Pussycats face the serious challenge of being true to themselves and to each other while ensnared in star-making machinery. Borrowing a few pages from Peter Watkins dead-serious ""Privilege"" (1967) and Bob Rafelsons comic-fantasy ""Head"" (1968) Kaplan and Elfont imagine a world in which pre-fab pop stars are manufactured and sold to masses of pliable trend-conscious teens while shadowy government-corporate co-conspirators manipulate those masses to maintain social order and more important a booming economy. The self-reflective cheekiness is almost breathtaking in its brazenness ""Josie"" itself is unabashedly a textbook example of the kind of product sold by the system that pic satirizes. Early on when ""Josie"" introduces DuJour a fave-rave boy band thats a spot-on burlesque of N Sync the filmmakers bare their satirical claws. From there its a quick hop to DuJours private plane an aircraft thats top-heavy with product-placements for Target stores Ivory dish detergent etc. etc. (Prominent displays of name-brand merchandise serve as a deliciously nasty running gag throughout the pic.) Unfortunately DuJour doesnt remain aloft very long Their flight is sabotaged by manager Wyatt Frame (Alan Cumming) after the band members air their suspicions about subliminal messages being added to their songs. Driven to find new nobodies who can be transformed overnight into pop music icons Frame fortuitously arrives in Riverdale U.S.A. where he discovers Josie and the Pussycats and signs them to a contract with Mega Records. Suddenly theyre whisked to New York and joined for the ride by Alan M. (Gabriel Mann) a dreamy-looking folk singer whos like catnip for Josie; Alexander Cabot (Paulo Costanzo) the groups none-too-bright original manager; and Alexandra Cabot (Missi Pyle) Alexanders sister a sour-tempered vixen who also has the hots for Alan M. In less than a week Josie and the Pussycats are chart-topping superstars with millions of frantic fans oodles of commercial endorsements and a cover-story profile in Rolling Stone. But success comes at a high price. Fiona (Parker Posey) the spectacularly vain-glorious CEO of Mega Records uses the Pussycat CDs to slip subliminal hard-sell messages into the brains of teens everywhere. Kaplan and Elfont cram so many in-jokes knowing allusions and on-target parodies into their pic that a second viewing may be mandatory for anyone who wants to savor all of the gags. Funniest bits involve efforts to control trends among teens (""Gatorade is the new Snapple"" ""Heath Ledger is the new Matt Damon""). No less a notable than Mr. Moviefone is embroiled in the stealthy brainwashing. And MTVs Carson Daly -- played in a bold stroke of casting by Carson Daly -- reveals his true colors as a ruthlessly efficient co-conspirator and potential murderer. Cook is a nifty Josie Reid is a funny dumb bunny and Dawson hits all the right notes. Cumming goes just far enough over the top; Posey goes a little too far. Mann looking and sounding very much like a younger and less threatening James Spader is suitably boy-toyish. Costanzo and Pyle are broad but amusing. Production values are just about purr-fect. With a little help from famed record producer Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds whos credited as an executive producer original songs are irresistibly upbeat with insidiously effective hooks. (Expect massive soundtrack CD sales and heavy airplay for punkish prom-queenly single ""Three Small Words."") Production design by Jasna Stefanovich enhances pics ironic edge with all the name brand glitz and glam that money can buy. But seriously folks A strong case could be made for ""Josie and the Pussycats"" as a revealing and richly detailed snapshot of contemporary pop culture. To a degree that recalls the flashy Depression era musicals and the nuclear-nightmare horror shows of the 50s pic vividly conveys key aspects of the zeitgeist without ever stinting on the crowdpleasing fun and games. Its made for the megaplexes but its also one for the time capsule.

"USATODAY.com - The anti-conformist message of Josie misses Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/11/2001 - Updated 0907 AM ET The anti-conformist message of Josie misses By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY Lets quickly get out our claws and tear at one of the more blatant im-purr-fections in Josie and the Pussycats ( out of four). In a jokey subtitle that mentions 70s bubblegum burnout Leif Garrett the vowels in his first name are transposed. Me-ouch. Since the very subject at hand in this crass satire of mass consumerism is the near-instantaneous turnover in teen-idol sensations the typo would seem to indicate a glaring lack of savvy. Read more Trailer Josie and the Pussycats trailer Story Reid Daly are smiling like Cheshire Pussycats But do notice how none of the supposedly plot-driven product placements everything from Target and Revlon to Steve Madden and Motorola are misspelled. The promo ops sink to their lowest depths when Saturday morning TVs cartoon answer to Chrissie Hynde Josie (aptly kittenish Rachael Leigh Cook) and her would-be beau share a romantic interlude near an aquariums whale tank. A billboard for Evian water presumably the H20 of choice for belugas looms large. The concept is so hypocritical its like Britney Spears calling Christina Aguilera underdressed and overexposed. Despite the cash from outside sponsors the film still looks as if it were shot through cut-rate pantyhose. Josie about the rapid rise and near-fall of a comic book-inspired trio of girl rockers with a weakness for cat-eared headwear is a tale as old as Rod Stewarts haircut. Band gets discovered and scores No. 1 hit. Lead singer overshadows backup players (Tara Reid as Melody as dumb as her drumsticks and Rosario Dawson as Val as buff as her bass). Band threatens to break up. Lead singer discovers subliminal messages aimed at adolescent buyers have been hidden in their songs. Band reunites and kicks bad-guy butt. OK some of that doesnt happen to every musical group. Except maybe Judas Priest. The story by writer/directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont (Cant Hardly Wait) while more feline than ferocious in its indictments of conformity does have a few original ideas. Such as how VH1s Behind the Music series is part of a conspiracy to knock off rock stars blaming their demises on drug overdoses and plane crashes. But the otherwise reverential mentions of MTV (including a cameo by TRLs Carson Daly Reids real-life snuggle-bunny) undercuts the spoofing. The three attractive leads are required to be little more than mouth-the-lyrics mannequins as they model an impressive collection of hanky halters and hip-huggers (actually more like crotch-huggers these days). The overacting is left to the villains an insanely droll Alan Cumming as the imperious manager of the Pussycats and superfreaky-as-always Parker Posey as a sinister record-label mogul. The brief parody about a boy band dubbed Dujour (get it?) that opens the movie is more in sync with the music industry than what follows. And not surprisingly since producing whiz Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds is in charge the bouncy power-pop tunes are pretty good like the Go-Gos in sugar shock. At least I think theyre good. Or maybe subliminal messages are messing with my mind. Excuse me. I feel a sudden urge to buy a cat-eared headband.

Spanked along by a soundtrack that has a surprising punky bite for something aimed at 13-year-olds (the super-catchy songs are like bubblegum Sleater-Kinney crossed with Joan Jett) the picture can make you long for the intellectual refinement of say the Charlies Angels movie but it offers a kind of junior-high dose of the same rebel-fashion-plate swagger. Like Elvis films The Monkees or the entire career of the Spice Girls Josie and the Pussycats is a great big soundtrack-and-image marketing juggernaut packaged as a ""knowing"" youthquake satire one that dares to ask the question Can a rock musical make devious fun of prefab disposable faux-cool teen pop even if it exists for no other reason than to package fresh new icons of prefab disposable faux-cool teen pop? You bet your electric-blue hip huggers it can. At the beginning theres a witty parody of sensitive-boy supergroups with actors like Breckin Meyer and Seth Green as members of the aptly named Dujour (theyll be gone tomorrow) doing soft-edged Caucasian hip-hop moves. The group is then whisked away by their evil-puppy manager Wyatt Frame (Alan Cumming) who abandons them in mid-flight parachuting off the plane as he prepares to discover -- that is create -- the Next Big Thing. That would be the Pussycats a band of new-wave teenyboppers from Riverdale. Small-boned leader Josie (Rachael Leigh Cook) blissed-out bimbo drummer Melody (Tara Reid) and no-nonsense rhythm guitarist Val (Rosario Dawson) are nothing if not game yet the three have a faintly innocuous second-banana modesty. This is a pop group with a lead singer but no stars all of which makes them perfect for Wyatt and his overseer Fiona (Parker Posey) the CEO of MegaRecords a fascist corporation that plants subliminal messages in pop CDs turning teenagers into avid consumer zombies who speak in breathless trend koans like ""Pepsi One is the new Diet Coke"" In their junior-Playboy kitty ears the Pussycats have little more grip as characters than they did as 70s feline rockers spun off from the Archie comics. Thats the films principal drawback -- sorry but Rachael Leigh Cook is not the new Cameron Diaz. Cook has a withdrawn mannequin glumness that makes it look as if shes had cosmetic surgery directly on her gene pool. She exudes an endearing earnestness in the concert scenes though and she helps to balance out the studious chicklet daffiness of Tara Reids Melody a one-joke character who expands to a joke and a quarter when she has to fend off an attack by Reids real-life fiance MTVs Buddha of shill Carson Daly. Josie and the Pussycats is hardly a good movie but its as flashy in its postmodern hard sell as a leopard-skin spandex tank top. Could Josie be the new Britney? Could the film be the new Bring It On? At the very least its the new and improved Coyote Ugly. Call it Coyote Pretty.

(Universal Pictures) Quick somebody call the vet the fat cats of Hollywood have coughed up a hairball ""Josie and the Pussycats"" an insufferable remake of the 1970s TV kiddie cartoon. If this live-action adaptation of pop-cultural piffle isnt proof of moviedoms creative poverty nothing is. In a pathetic attempt to dignify the project the studio hacks have saddled this alley cat with a cause Exposing the way craven corporations are fobbing off their garbage onto impressionable teens. Of course MGM and Universal the companies behind ""Josie"" eschew these practices. Never mind all those product placements ha ha ha. Thats writer-directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfonts idea of kid-comprehensible satire. Theyve cobbled together a scenario in which bands that look a lot like N Sync are created by a government-backed cabal of businessmen who then hide subliminal sales pitches in the songs. In the movie Josie and her kittenish collaborators are not superstars but a garage band that plays to indifferent audiences in bowling alleys and supermarket shopping lots. Then along comes Wyatt Frame (tiresome Alan Cumming) a smarmy manager who is desperate to replace an increasingly troublesome boy band. Upon discovering the Pussycats - a bubble-gum punk group composed of plucky guitarist Josie (Rachael Leigh Cook) dizzy drummer Melody (Tara Reid) and banal bassist Valerie (Rosario Dawson) - he signs them to a contract and flies them to New York where they are groomed in a tired ""Oprah""-style makeover montage. In less than a week the Pussycats are chart-toppers pursued by swarms of gaga fans. But when Josie becomes the most popular of the three Valerie and Melanie are upset. The movies negligible source of suspense Will the gal pals remain true to themselves and each other or will the fur fly? But more important when oh when will the pussyfooting be over?""Josie and the Pussycats"" (98 minutes) is rated PG-13.

Written and directed by Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 95 minutes.) The state of pop probably does need a dressing down. But is ""Josie and the Pussycats"" the right movie for the job? What should have been 90 zippy minutes of jingling giggling winking fakery adds up to only about 20 minutes of fun. Yes the circus comes to town and rapidly turns into a lecture. Not entirely content to get happy ""Josie and the Pussycats"" broods over the fact that in pop things fall apart. The deliriously fun early-70s Hanna-Barbera cartoon and Archies comic is now a slick intermittently stylish live-action tongue-lashing about corporate sponsorship and free thinking. The movies jammed with drive-by gags riffs on fleeting fame homages (the Go-Gos etc.) and Parker Posey making it all up as she goes along. Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan (""Cant Hardly Wait"") are a writer-director duo with a scratch in their vinyl. As they see it the overhaul of the cartoon is the ideal opportunity to mete out satire of corporate-consumer culture with a pervasive lollapalooza of brand names. Once you get the joke -- that duh the wall between corporate image and self-image is permeable -- its only a matter of time before the movie makes you feel weird about laughing. This movie contains raw language.
