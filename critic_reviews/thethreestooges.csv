Big names like Jim Carrey and Benicio Del Toro came and went leaving the door open for the unexpectedly perfect trio of relative unknowns Chris Diamontopoulos Sean Hayes and Will Sasso. They play Moe Larry and Curly the bumbling idiots who must venture into the big wide world to save the orphanage where they grew up. The result is neither big nor clever - an attempt to bring things up to date by roping in the cast of Jersey Shore falls resoundingly flat - but it is fast and at times brilliantly funny. From casting Larry David as a nun (Sister Mary Mengele) through a series of defiantly dark foster-family jokes to a genius Gone with the Wind-inspired sight gag about farm-fed salmon The Three Stooges is exactly the film it wants to be. Was it worth ten years of anyones life? Probably not. Is it worth 88 minutes of yours? Absolutely.

Firstly how do you find 3 actors who look like the original Stooges? And secondly can the humour which is fine in 15 minute segments stretch to 90 minutes? The answer to both questions is a resounding YES. Chris D in particular is uncannily like Moe Howard in both looks and mannerisms and Will Sasso comes a very close second as Curly Howard. Sean Hayes is not quite so good as Larry but is not bad by any means. And the humour? - yes of course its childish and slapstick but that was all part of the Stooges charm.

The fact it took so long to make and had so many changes must tell you something. Sadly this pet project needs to be put out if its misery. It isnt so much a film as three half hour episodes crudely put together. After about 15 minutes the slapstick starts to get boring only about five minutes after the plot. The Farrellys co wrote produced and directed the film. Perhaps they really needed an independent view because there should be been some quality control exercised. I was disappointed. Trust me this isnt another There is something about Mary. No real laughs just a few juvenile sniggers from some of the children at the viewing I saw this at. Its better than the Keith Lemon film so it isnt the worst film to get released this week.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/91509/the-three-stooges.html,200,thethreestooges0,thethreestooges,timeout

By David Denby Texas hold em Shirley MacLaine Jack Black and Matthew McConaughey.   Credit Illustration by Carlos Aponte Richard Linklaters ""Bernie"" is devoted to a young man with exceptionally beautiful manners. Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) stout and soft-spoken works as an assistant funeral director in the small town of Carthage in East Texas. He puts on a good show. He dresses the bodies with care (the movie begins with him cosmetically enhancing a corpse); he sings at the services in a lovely light tenor; he consoles the bereaved. When a husband dies he shows up at the widows house with flowers and candy. And his benevolence isnt always self-serving--he gives away money when he has nothing to gain by it and stages musicals at a local school. A gentle closeted gay man he brings light to Carthage gracing the parched town with culture and refinement. No one is surprised when Bernie starts spending time with the wealthy elderly widow Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine) a miser given to screaming fits. Who else would put up with her? By degrees Bernie becomes her friend and business manager and eventually her travelling companion and sole heir. And no one is much surprised or bothered when Bernie exhausted by Marjories demands on him (everything we assume but sexual demands) shoots her four times in the back with a .22 rifle normally used for killing armadillos. As far as the town is concerned she deserved it. Anyway Bernie is too sweet a man to be punished for the crime. This comedy of generosity money lust and skewed perception is based on a true story. In 1998 two years after the murder the journalist Skip Hollandsworth wrote about it for Texas Monthly (""Midnight in the Garden of East Texas""). He and Linklater who grew up in East Texas collaborated on a screenplay and after more than a decade finally got the picture made. Its an odd movie--mild in tone and circumspect yet darkly funny and done in a hybrid form that I dont think has been used so thoroughly before. Linklater cast good actors in the leading and subsidiary roles but devotes perhaps forty per cent of the screen time to interviews with the real residents of Carthage who years after the events talk about the actual Bernie and Marjorie. (You see some of the incidents they describe performed by the actors.) ""Id never seen a movie told from the perspective of a group of gossips"" Linklater has said. ""But in this case it seemed like the proper narrative technique that would reveal everything you could ever really know about the town and the people involved."" What it reveals is both touching and strange. On porches in living rooms and in stores ebullient women in bouffant hair and drawling cautious men with neatly trimmed beards and mustaches explain how much they liked and admired Bernie. Some of the women asked him to ""do"" their funerals; even after death they wanted his caressing attention his touch of class. The men are somewhat less ardent. A few noticed that he was gay--""a little light in the loafers""--but they accepted him as a harmless fellow who had a friendly way with everybody. Linklater wickedly suggests that this ingratiating style combined with Christian piety consorts well with a tyrannical Southern insistence on civility. That Bernie was also a liar and a murderer is not something that most of Carthage ever took in. The local voices--foolish proper occasionally stinging--make a daft but instructive music. Linklater has made a smart movie with a mordant satirical edge but he almost falls victim to his own sense of authenticity. The interviews prevent the picture from developing much momentum or suspense. Every time Linklater gets some tension going he returns to the women on the porch. What we need to see is more of the relationship between Bernie and Marjorie which as portrayed here doesnt go much beyond what people describe. We never develop our own understanding of what happened. It might have been fun if Linklater had been a bit more inventive--if he had made a sort of East Texas ""Sunset Boulevard""--but he seems to feel that he would have betrayed his corner of Texas if he had made too much up. Shirley MacLaine with a masklike face and scratchy caterwaul is frightening as the aging termagant but shes hardly on the screen. Matthew McConaughey plays Danny Buck Davidson the indignant and boastful prosecutor who went after Bernie in court. Now forty-two McConaughey has lost some of his buttery blond-beauty dullness. Hes leaner tougher almost acid. Hes the acting surprise of the movie yet its Jack Blacks film. Without him ""Bernie"" would have been little more than an intelligent misfire a curiosity. The comic actor suppresses his smirk and his devilish stare and stays within character. He gives Bernie a mincing walk--but not too mincing. He makes him over-precise in his speech and movements a devious man who knows that graciousness is both armor and weapon. Its a fine disciplined piece of acting and it binds us to the mystery of Bernies character in which self-seeking and the genuine desire to be useful exist side by side. Spreading Marjories money around after shes dead Bernie sets people up in business gives them home-repair cash or a new swing set for the kids. In a kind of epilogue we see the real Bernie Tiede as Jack Black interviews him presumably picking up hints. In prison now busy as ever distributing good cheer and preaching Christian virtue to the inmates Bernie seems a happy man. Whats funnier--intentional or unintentional comedy? Nothing could be more intentional than ""The Three Stooges"" a successful re-creation of the antic mayhem of the finger-in-your-eye trio. The movie is so infantile that it achieves a special kind of purity and gentleness. The Stooges--the enraged Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) the naively hopeful Larry (Sean Hayes) and the massive shrieking baby Curly (Will Sasso)--slap bonk knuckle-punch hammer-blow and stomp on one another. The picture of course is a love story. The old Three Stooges shorts were made in the nineteen-thirties and forties and if you watch them now they look cramped airless and smudged. The slapstick of this movie photographed in color and staged in open space is larger and weirder and its so far divorced from any imaginable reality that it lodges in a pleasant zone of square surrealism. The Farrelly brothers who directed take physical comedy to levels of intricacy not seen since silent movies. The bodies get pretzelled together limbs and heads intertwined the three men working as a unit. Even when separated they seem connected; their conjoined flow is as spiritual as it is physical. The movie runs down--repetition is built into its DNA--and the plot is meaningless. But there are incidental pleasures such as the recurring appearance of Larry David as a bespectacled irascible nun named Sister Mary Mengele. Then theres the unwittingly funny ""Lockout"" starring Guy Pearce as an outer-space Galahad. The movie is set in 2078. The President of the United States daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) who curls her upper lip when shes angry or excited journeys to MS One an experimental prison orbiting the earth where five hundred of the most dangerous--or at least the ugliest--criminals are locked in pods asleep to be removed now and then so that unspeakable experiments can be performed on their bodies. Emilie wants to expose this outrage. But when she gets to the prison a riot breaks out the zombies are released from slumber and shes captured and menaced especially by one Hydell (Joe Gilgun) who has a sunken tattooed chest a head that cranes off to one side and eyes that glare in different directions. The press notes helpfully tell us that Gilgun an Englishman ""comes from one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Manchester"" which makes us wonder who comes from the most dangerous neighborhood in Manchester. He looks like a psychotic turkey. Back on earth Snow (Pearce) yet another C.I.A. guy who has been set up on a murder charge and has gone rogue is dispatched to MS One to liberate Emilie before her father orders the prison destroyed. At the screening in between laughing fits people around me whispered in awed tones ""B movie 1956."" When Snow arrives Emilie is dead and he resurrects her by sticking a syringe through her eyeball to her brain. Awakened she falls into sandpapery sexual banter with him; they slug each other almost as often as Moe and Curly. The rest of the movie consists of the couple escaping into one green air-locked room after another as the prison beasts rage outside. If you were to watch ""Lockout"" a few months from now at home alone it wouldnt produce more than a shrug. Movies this bad need to be revered in public places. Go see it in a mall and try to sneak a beer or two in with you.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Watching at home with your unlucky siblings the true beauty of these fools was clear They were family. Their abuse was a kind of love. This long-belated Hollywood version helmed by secret softies the Farrelly brothers gets this idea completely. Not only do Moe (Diamantopoulos) Larry (Hayes) and Curly (the delicate Sasso) come to life via expert near-breathtaking impersonations by a trio of well-practiced comedians--extra kudos for nailing the Depression-era Brooklynese--but they actually feel like a genetic clan meant to cause mayhem as a group never solo. So why does the new effort essentially about saving their orphanage occasionally ring as hollow as a well-placed head bonk? The metafriction between these classic dupes and todays idiots chafes uneasily. Larry David playing a furious never-funny nun only emphasizes his personas misplaced shrillness; even less successful are bodacious Sofia Vergara (as a scheming gold digger) and the Jersey Shore cast mystified when Moe is drafted to their reality-TV show and too squishy to receive his slaps. As with the shorts our enjoyment was never about the scenarios just the weird Zen of furious hand-to-Stooge combat. The movie gives you that in fits and starts (its even divided into three mini segments) but still feels a woob-woob-woob stretched out.

The Holy Trinity of knockabout numbskull comedy--fritz-haloed Larry yipping lummox Curly and bowl-cut fascist Moe--are introduced as theyre ditched on the steps of an orphanage. Twenty-five years later theyve grown up to resemble respectively television comics Sean Hayes Will Sasso and Chris Diamantopoulos unleashed on the unsuspecting world when the only home the unclaimed foundlings have known is threatened with foreclosure. The trusty old emergency-fundraising plot (see the Farrellys Kingpin) is just a handy rack to hang gags on and the leads acquit themselves in the physical comedy resurrecting shtick honed on a thousand-and-one vaudeville stages and recreated in as many playgrounds. Never accused of being visual stylists the Farrellys shoot with a straightforward clarity that approximates the rudimentary slightly-shabby feel of the Stooges short-subjects while adding a little mushiness thats entirely their own. Beyond some CGI-augmented violence the biggest concession to updating the Stooges for the 21st century is a subplot that lands Moe on a reality TV show identifying the Stooges contribution to our pop-culture as part of an ongoing tradition of tone-lowering public jackassery.

Plenty of old properties get dusted off and trotted out as cynical money-making ploys but here the Farrellys demonstrate real affection for Larry Moe and Curly (their opinion of Shemp remains unexamined). I dont doubt for a minute their sincerity in wanting people to rediscover the old eye-poking nose-twisting Stooge magic. Nor do I think its insulting to the legacies of Larry Fine Moe Howard and Curly Howard to have other actors play the icons they created any more than it was disrespectful to find a new voice for Kermit after Jim Henson died. You have to do it right of course and the degree of difficulty in doing it right is immense but theres nothing inherently distasteful about the idea. No any reasonable objections to the Farrellys Three Stooges will not be on the grounds that it desecrates a revered comedy franchise but on the grounds that its not very funny. The screenplay (which the Farrellys wrote with longtime pal Mike Cerrone) has a workable premise -- Larry Moe and Curly must raise money to save the orphanage they grew up in -- but its hindered by something that might be an unavoidable truth when it comes to Stooge humor a little of it goes a long way. The original trio made 20-minute shorts that were concentrated doses of physical shtick unburdened by matters of character development or continuity. Stretching that into 90 minutes means adding supporting characters and subplots rising action and interpersonal conflicts. If theres a way to do that so it blends seamlessly with the simple Stooge aesthetic the Farrellys didnt find it. Larry (Sean Hayes) Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) and Curly (Will Sasso) in their efforts to raise money are tricked into working with a gorgeous rich woman (Sofia Vergara) whos looking to get rid of her husband (Kirby Heyborne) so she can run off with his best friend (Craig Bierko). The fellas squabble over how to proceed and while squabbling is an integral part of Stoogedom its supposed to manifest itself in punching and smacking not in Moe separating from the other two and going off on his own. (Tender moments? In The Three Stooges? The only thing that should be tender is Curlys forehead after Moe drags a cheese grater across it.) That bad idea is compounded by another one as Moe stumbles into a career as the newest cast member of MTVs Jersey Shore. If youre skeptical about Stooge humor being performed by a new Larry Moe and Curly wait till you see it done by Snooki and The Situation. Meanwhile back at the orphanage -- well you dont care about whats happening at the orphanage do you? Any scene that doesnt have at least two Stooges in it is a waste of time and feels like one. But for the record the nuns are played by Jane Lynch Jennifer Hudson Kate Upton and amusingly Larry David as Sister Mary-Mengele the meanest manliest nun who ever crossed paths with three hammer-swinging boys. Theres a sick kid too but whatever. Scattered throughout the film and appearing at unpredictable intervals are a handful of solid laughs. When theyre not bogged down with non-Stooge matters the Farrellys are quite faithful in re-creating the tone and flavor of Stooge humor and every now and then a gag works exactly as it was meant to. The mayhem never builds into anything gut-busting but its watchable. Hayes Sasso and Diamantopoulos do exceptionally good impersonations of Larry Curly and Moes voices and mannerisms and they execute the slapstick choreography with satisfying skill. The actors obviously learned the routines the way a great dancer learns a ballet -- through careful study and painstaking rehearsal and probably a lot of ice packs -- and the Farrellys give them plenty of wide shots and unbroken takes to show it off. Whats strange is that even when what theyre doing is exactly like something youd see in an old Three Stooges short it doesnt register a lot of laughs. Yanking your friends tongue or hitting him in the face with a plank of wood isnt automatically funny; you have to work for it and these guys know it. They have worked for it. But its still not quite there. Maybe its just that the original Stooges perfected their craft over the course of decades while these guys have had to take a crash course but it also feels like theres some intangible magic that cant be forced no matter how closely you re-create the circumstances. (Remember that shot-for-shot remake of Psycho?) There are individual moments of Stooge bliss to be found here but everything surrounding them is a dud.

"Woe is Moe Just say nyuk to Stooges |       NJ.com comments Woe is Moe Just say nyuk to Stooges Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 13 2012 at 822 AM View/Post Comments Peter IovinoCurly (Will Sasso left) Larry (Sean Hayes) and Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos). So what exactly is the worst moment in the new ""The Three Stooges"" movie? When Moe and Curly -- both in nurses uniforms -- each grab a urinating infant and use them like water pistols on each other? When Sofia Vergara -- squealing louder than Charo on ""The Hollywood Squares"" -- has a rat squirm down her cleavage? Or is it when Moe joins the cast of ""Jersey Shore"" doling out eye pokes hair pulls skull slaps and knuckle sandwiches to all? Actually that last is kind of a high point. Watching the rest of the movie though is a bit like being poked in the eye yourself. Cheaply and flatly shot oddly scored to snatches of classic rock cast with a troupe of crummy kid actors its less a movie than a playground assault. The only possibly interesting thing about it is trying to figure out why it was made at all. True the brothers who wrote and directed it Bobby and Peter Farrelly are lifelong fans of the Stooges -- particularly the black-and-white shorts the original trio made back in the 30s and 40s. Yet its hard to see what they learned from them. Although ""Theres Something About Mary"" was rudely funny most of the Farrellys movies have relied less on slapstick than on over-the-top situations and gross-out gags. Which perhaps is why they havent had a real hit since -- well since Judd Apatow started making movies. So with ""The Three Stooges"" theyve gone back to their original comic inspiration which casts new actors as the three constantly squabbling characters grown-up foundlings trying to raise money for their old orphanage. But dont believe the old catchphrase Imitation is merely the laziest form of flattery. And rather than salute the old Stooges with something fresh what the Farrellys have done is try to copy them exactly from comic sound effects to Curlys ""Soitenly"" Its a pointless idea and a thankless job. Yes the three main actors -- Sean Hayes Chris Diamantopoulos and the cheerful Will Sasso -- do expert impressions of Larry Moe and Curly. But why would you want to see anyone do an impression when the originals are as close as a DVD rental? And while the violent slapstick is authentic and well choreographed (timing those eye-pokes takes work) other things feel vaguely off. Bathroom humor? Boob jokes? A drug reference? (Which obviously slipped by the MPAA fossils who gave this a kid-friendly PG). If this is a tribute its a crass and clumsy one. Nor is there much here besides the new Stooges. The genuinely funny Jane Lynch and Brian Doyle-Murray are given throwaway parts; Jennifer Hudson pops up briefly as a singing nun (although the Farrellys typically never bother to develop the joke). Given plenty of screen time unfortunately is Larry David who plays Sister Mary Mengele. And if the very thought of David in a nuns habit playing someone named after a concentration-camp doctor is your idea of fun -- well this is the picture for you. The rest of us though can just say nyuk. Ratings note The film contains crude humor and endless supposedly comic violence.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Theres an idea at play in this rampant idiocy as well as considerable risk. In trying to introduce a new generation to the slapstick art of the Three Stooges directors and co-writers Bobby and Peter Farrelly do it the hard way. Instead of a standard biopic that might explain how a 1930s vaudeville act called the Three Stooges - brothers Moe and Curly Howard and their friend Larry Fine - made their Hollywood mark with nearly 200 short films that featured the boys slapping poking and punching each other senseless the Farrellys decided to hit the 2012 multiplex with a trio of Stooges shorts set in the present. Kids know the short clips on Funny or Die dont they even if they never caught the Stooges online or DVD. And besides audiences with short attention spans are bigger than ever. And if the Farrellys couldnt cast their movie with lookalikes they would find three actors willing to be silly putty in their mischievous hands. And so to play Larry skilled clown Sean Hayes (Will and Grace) transforms himself by shaving his head down the middle letting prickly tufts of Larry-like hair protrude on the sides. As baldy boy Curly Mad TVs Will Sasso steps up with the needed rolypoly charm. And to play Moe the bossy ringleader of Stooge domination theres Greek-born Chris Diamantopoulos with a bowl cut and Brooklyn accent (""Soitenly"") that is Moe to the life. Once Sean Penn had designs on playing Larry as Benicio del Toro had on Moe and Jim Carrey on Curly. But Hayes Sasso and Diamantopoulos do themselves and the Stooges proud.

The actors deserve a full-throated woo-woo-woo But the gags dont blossom with repetition. The Stooges were always better in short doses. And 90 minutes of PG nyuk-nyuk-nyuk can seem like an eternity. Even when Moe hooks up with the cast of Jersey Shore this centurys bottom-feeding purveyors of lowbrow comedy the jokes grow stale. For the Farrellys The Three Stooges is a labor of love.

Starring Sean Hayes Will Sasso Chris Diamantopoulos Jane Lynch Jennifer Hudson Sofia Vergara Craig Bierko Stephen Collins Larry David Director Bobby Farrelly Peter Farrelly Release Opened Apr 13 2012  Editorial Review Once slapstick now just stupid By Sean OConnellFriday Apr. 13 2012""The Three Stooges"" isnt presented in 3-D. Moe Larry and Curly cant reach through the screen to poke your eyes box your ears pull your nose hairs or sock you in the stomach. That doesnt mean you are completely safe. The imbecilic ""Stooges"" still manages to pummel you into submission with 92 minutes of relentless stupidity. Even by Stooges standards its overly juvenile and totally dumb. What I didnt expect was for it to be so dated and out of touch with what modern audiences find funny. ""You havent changed a bit"" one character tells the Three Stooges. Maybe they should have though. Just a little. The original Stooges of course were a vaudeville act whose physical shtick was characterized by aggressive but finely choreographed kicks punches snaps and falls. The Stooges put the ""slap"" in slapstick the ""rough"" in rough and tumble . . . and for the time period (primarily in the 1930s and 40s) it was high comedy. With the Farrelly brothers (Bobby and Peter) ""Stooges"" the routine hits a new low. The worst criticism I can level at this reboot is that its unnecessary. There isnt a single idea in the film that justifies the Farrellys dragging these classic characters out of the mothballs no valid reason to put three willing actors through the torturous rigors of a lackluster Stooges story. Once years ago the Farrellys had a reason. Theyd been developing a Stooges script and they allegedly had Jim Carrey Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro loosely attached to the roles of Curly Larry and Moe respectively. Tell me that doesnt sound enticing. And yet Im not even sure that trio of award winners could have brought enough firepower to ignite the dim gags served up in this lackadaisical ""Stooges."" The story starts with the baby Stooges being abandoned on the steps of an orphanage where Mother Superior (Jane Lynch) Sister Rosemary (Jennifer Hudson) and Sister Mary-Mengele (""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" curmudgeon Larry David) struggle to raise the terrible toddlers. Thankfully the Farrellys and regular screenwriting collaborator Mike Cerrone (""Me Myself and Irene"") fast-forward through 25 years of antics to get to a point where older Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) Larry (Sean Hayes) and Curly (Will Sasso) must venture off into the real world. Theyre tasked with raising 830000 in 30 days or their precious orphanage faces foreclosure. They are men - er grown children - on a mission. And then . . . well not much happens really. The trio is hired by a sultry vixen whod like the bumbling idiots to bump off her husband (Kirby Heyborne) so she finally can be with her lover (Craig Bierko). And this is supposed to be a PG-rated kids movie? The temptress by the way is played by flavor-of-the-month Sofia Vergara who proves with each new movie role that her pitch-perfect ""Modern Family"" character is the only gimmick in her bag of tricks. Later Moe is cast on a reality show - a premise that has real potential to skewer this empty excuse for modern entertainment. But the Farrellys can offer only ""Jersey Shore"" jabs that were outdated when the brothers wrote them and smell even mustier now. The Farrellys have made funny movies mining smart humor from notoriously idiotic protagonists in the subversive ""Kingpin"" and the proud-to-be-moronic ""Dumb and Dumber."" But the brothers have been stuck in a rut lately and ""Stooges"" isnt going to help pull them out. Not that the Farrellys arent faithful. They are. They mimic the Stooges crude comedic designs with painstaking devotion. Sound effects are lifted from the source material. The recognizable Stooges theme song opens the film which is broken down into three digestible episodes. The brothers wisely borrow from such classics as the hospital-based ""Calling All Curs"" from 1939. And the three actors do credible Stooges impersonations. Theres even an offbeat melancholia to Hayess Larry that made him sympathetic and by extension interesting. The Farrellys in effect have created a cover band. They play all the hits (pun intended) although its not the same and the difference is bothersome. So why bother with this earnest but imperfect impersonation when the original artists are readily available on VHS and DVD?Contains slapstick action violence some rude and suggestive humor including language.

Photo Chris Diamantopoulos Sean Hayes and Will Sasso in a scene from ""The Three Stooges."" (AP) You would think that after a quarter-century in development at four different studios somebody would have figured out how to make a funny movie about the Three Stooges. After all Moe Larry and Curly appeared in dozens of hilarious classic theatrical shorts between 1934 and Curlys retirement in 1946. Benicio Del Toro Sean Penn and Jim Carrey nearly starred in ""The Three Stooges for Bobby and Peter Farrelly a few years ago. Unfortunately we can only imagine that version. The three actors who ended up playing the zany comics for the filmmaker brothers -- Chris Diamantopoulos Sean Hayes and Will Sasso -- offer fairly precise physical and vocal imitations of Moe Larry and Curly respectively. And they execute fairly precise re-creations of their predecessors violent routines -- pokes in the eyes and hammers on the head included (with appropriate sound effects). But to exactly what end? For starters it wasnt a great idea to basically borrow the premise of ""The Blues Brothers and turn these quintessential Jewish characters (something thats not even hinted at) into the bumbling would-be saviors of the Catholic orphanage where they were raised. Illustrating the films rough level of wit we have Larry David of all people playing Sister Mary Mengele the Stooges nemesis at the orphanage -- named after the infamous Nazi doctor who conducted experiments on concentration-camp prisoners. Jane Lynch is wasted in a straight role as the mother superior and Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson also on hand in a wimple does little more than smile beatifically and sing a spiritual. Things dont get much better when the three sheltered maniacs set out -- on a bicycle built for three -- into a real world theyre hardly equipped for. Not that the film does much with this aside from one scene where the pugnacious Moe cringes when someone promises to poke him on Facebook. The boys unwisely agree to help a femme fatale (Sofia Vergara) bump off a husband she claims is dying anyway but end up almost killing her lover (Craig Bierko). When they crash a high-society party and create chaos it only serves to remind this Stooge-loving baby boomer how much more effectively the originals did this sort of thing. The Farrellys invented the modern-day R-rated comedy with ""Theres Something About Mary (1998) and the shift to PG-rated family fare here is not a great fit for them. Their appearance in an on-screen ""dont do this at home lecture at the end of the movie is notably humorless. An interminable nursery sequence with projectile-urinating infants is more bizarre than actually funny. And a gag about the Stooges farming salmon on dry land as the pun-happy Stooges would put it just lies there like a dead fish. Nothing that happens in this long-awaited sloppily sentimental and utterly pointless ""The Three Stooges is actually anywhere near as amusing as the history of the film itself. It had already been in the works for years when the original Stooges heirs brought suit in 1993 against the trios longtime home Columbia Pictures accusing the studio of using development money for the movie as a slush fund to pay for the services of Hollywood Madam Heidi Fleiss girls. As everyone whos seen the ""Three Stooges"" trailer knows Moe eventually becomes a celebrity as a cast member of ""Jersey Shore. Its giving away absolutely nothing to report that the funniest line is delivered by Snooki who tells a producer ""Basically what youre saying is that our show is about the ratings. But what exactly is ""The Three Stooges about? Beats me.

STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 13 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The first good joke occurs when you stare up at the marquee and see that The Three Stooges is rated PG for parental guidance. Adults ""guiding"" their kids though Stooge Land; how does that work? Look see Moe poke Larry in the eyes. Thats right two fingers.... Listen to Curly the way he lands hard on the last syllable - nyuk nyuk nyuk. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new Farrelly brothers comedy ""The Three Stooges"" Movies The Three Stooges The official trailer The actors who play the Three Stooges meet the press in character AP Movies Video The return of The Three Stooges Dumb dumber and dumbest the Three Stooges luckily began their film careers in the Depression when adult tantrums were permissible. From 1933 and 1934 alone Moses Horwitz (Moe) his brother Jerome (Curly) and Louis Feinberg (Larry) slapped themselves silly making 20 movies and shorts. All of their lunatic manoeuvres every hoo-hoo-hoo and hammer to the head made it to TV. By 1959 190 vintage Stooge shorts were showing up on networks Saturday mornings - catnip for Boomer kids constrained by braces and report cards. Though kids loved them parents certainly didnt; maybe because Curly pronounced the word ""soitenly."" Now Moe Curly and Larry are back courtesy of the Farrelly brothers Stooge worshippers who once brightened our world with Theres Something About Mary. Their most overt Stooge homage begins with a moving car throwing a duffel bag at an orphanage. A nun (Larry David closely barbered) opens the bag and gets two fingers in the peepers. The sight of David in drag might frighten Stooge Nation. Not to mention parents with kids to guide. Does the new Stooge-a-thon go all Farrelly - off-colour and off-the-wall? Dont worry the brothers wanted to make a Stooges movie not another Farrelly film (good career move after Hall Pass) so they took a salary cut in exchange for casting approval and the understanding they were doing an old-fashioned Stooge movie. The result which could be entitled Theres Something About Curly is an unabashedly moronic celebration of slap shtick. No swearing but we do see Moe thrust a 20-pound lobster down Larrys pants exciting a stampede of vowels punctuated by an operatic howl. Thats a good one and The Three Stooges weighs in at about 15 howlers over 90 minutes. Not bad about the same ratio of hilarity to hokey as the Stooges old shorts. Fans also will be glad to know that Moe Curly and Larry are played with gusto and finesse. Jim Carrey Mel Gibson (who has clearly been itching to play Moe) Sean Penn and Russell Crowe had all been attached to the Stooges project. But the Farrellys went B-list choosing two Canadians - with glowing hearts we see thee rise - to take the parts of the famous knuckleheads. Torontos Chris Diamantopoulos ( 24) plays tantrum-prone Moe as intended - like an angry 180-pound four-year-old. The Ladner B.C.-born Will Sasso ( MadTV) handles all of Curlys moves the castanet finger-snapping dog barks even the bit where Curly throws himself to the floor and runs in circles while lying down pivoting on his shoulder. And Sean Hayes ( Will amp; Grace) simply is Larry from the squinty near-sighted stare to draggy head-cold whine. Still when The Three Stooges slows down to service the plot - our boys strike out into the world to raise money for their orphanage - the movie is as slack as a hammock. The Stooges were probably meant to be seen on television Saturday morning while consuming fast food and coloured juices. Stooge Nation can do that when the DVD comes out. For fans in a hurry the movie opens Friday. Bring your own Pop- Tarts and Tang.

Either they view the Stooges with eye-rolling contempt dismissing them as talentless and unfunny nincompoops. Or they go right back to the afternoon-TV nostalgia of their childhoods recalling the Stooges as stupidly irresistible clowns the most daffy and inviting of pain freaks -- ones who could make you laugh helplessly. Then however theres that other level of Three Stooges fandom the major-league mania the kind that powers the Farrelly Brothers startlingly fun and ingenious act of nuthouse homage/re-creation The Three Stooges. For the true critically unhinged Stooges connoisseur (I have at moments been guilty of this level of adulation) it isnt enough to say that the Three Stooges put the low in lowbow comedy. For some of us the Stooges had more than great timing or the ability to beat the hell out of each other in a viciously impervious and nimble style. They had a vision. They were oversize scallywag Munchkins who wove an entire comic universe out of fear frustration maniacal resentment and borderline hysteria. Grouchy angels of dysfunction they turned slapping bashing and humiliating into a weird form of connection. They were brothers united in slapstick torment. A lot of what makes the Stooges comedy work especially in their vintage films of the 30s is that their finger-in-the-face brutality is so loopy and spontaneous that its like watching the live-action version of a super-violent Tex Avery cartoon. As directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly revive those routines with a sensational meticulous fidelity but spontaneity is by nature a hard thing to re-create. For a while you almost cant help but experience the movie in a slightly detached way as an extraordinary carbon copy of a bygone comedy era. At an orphanage where we first meet the Stooges as little rascals their ""Hell-o Hell-o Hell-o"" heads-in-the-doorway fanfare seems a little forced and the casting of Larry David -- yes Larry David -- as the ultimate dour sexless nun Sister Mary-Mengele is one of those Farrelly stunts that calls so much attention to itself youre not quite sure if its funny or just meta-funny. But once the Stooges grow up and go out into the world the movie starts to jell in a fluky original way. The Farrellys have taken the bowl-cut ringleader Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) the Bozo-haired sad sack Larry (Sean Hayes) and the light-on-his-toes oaf Curly (Will Sasso) and plunked them down in 21st-century America where a babe (Sofia Vergara) and her boyfriend (Craig Bierko) lure them into a plot to murder the babes husband (Kirby Heyborne). (They think theyre getting 830000 for the job and plan to use the money to save their old orphanage.) The contemporary setting turns out to work incredibly well because it lends a fresh hip vitality to the Stooges violence. ""I thought I told you to smother him"" barks Moe at Curly standing near the man in a hospital bed who theyve signed on to kill. ""I am"" says Curly holding an onion and a vegetable peeler ""Im smothering him in onions"" """"Ehhh"" growls Moe ""good thinking Emeril"" as he takes the peeler and applies it to Curlys skull. ""Ill tweet you"" says someone to Curly a little later on. ""Oh tweet us to dinner? Soitenly"" Bits like that do more than revive the Stooges idiocy -- they give it flava. And so do the actors. All three of the leads get very close to the Stooges old looks and personalities but they do more than impersonate; they inhabit. Sean Hayes in his monstrously ugly frizz-mop (the subject of many a droll and bewildered putdown) does wonders with Larrys lost-puppy stare and syrupy voice; he makes him a touching trusting dupe the kind who will never be fast enough to outthink Moes open hand. Chris Diamantopoulos captures Moes 30s back-alley toughness and his super-fast brainiac rhythms though a part of me wishes that hed been even more of a scowling pill. If anything hes a touch softer than the real Moe. But Will Sasso as the greatest of all the Stooges the infantile genius Curly not only looks the part to an eerie degree. He also magically channels Curlys terror joy dog-barking displaced aggression and ""Woo-woo-woo"" insanity. His rubber face stretches in a millisecond from a cringe of pain to a squint of befuddled disgruntlement and he uses his big body like a tubby ballet dancer who doesnt so much suspend gravity as ignore it. When Moe Larry and Curly standing on a theater stage finally go at it in an all-out way whacking each other like theres no tomorrow the violence is so catchy and free-form its almost jazz a bebop trio of sadomasochistic slapstick. How funny is The Three Stooges? I confess that I chuckled in amusement more than I laughed out loud. Its an enchantingly well-done tribute that revives and even refreshes our affection for the Stooges yet at its core it lacks the completely and totally unhinged shock of the new. Thats true even when Moe ends up as a reality star on Jersey Shore a joke that sounds brilliant in theory but that to me actually took the movie out of Stooges land. Then again the one thing I couldnt do in watching The Three Stooges was experience the Stooges routines in a way that a new generation might. Will this movie playing to young viewers who dont know the Stooges at all look off-puttingly old-fashioned or so bizarrely slapstick-intense that it seems as up-to-the-minute in its comedy as anything from Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell? I honestly have no idea. But should they go to see it? Soitenly A?

"The Three Stooges is gentle despite the roughhousing Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EyeReview The Three StoogesThe comedy with Chris Diamantopoulos Sean Hayes and Will Sasso as Moe Larry and Curly is an amusing tribute from the Farrelly brothers.April 13 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Chris Diamantopoulos left Sean Hayes and Will Sasso star as the title... (Peter Iovino 20th Century...)There is an appealing nyuk nyuk nostalgic spirit to""The Three Stooges.""To fully appreciate this paean to slapstick and silly nonsense simply requires that cynicism be temporarily shelved and the thinking side of the brain shut down.Starring Sean Hayes Will Sasso and Chris Diamantopoulos as Larry Curly and Moe this affectionate update is a love letter to the Stooges from the filmmaking Farrelly brothers Peter and Bobby. Though they may be best known for the R-rated ""Theres Something About Mary"" there is a Stooge streak a mile long running through their work a the bumbling misfits with a heart of gold in their first film ""Dumb amp; Dumber"" for starters. It ultimately made them a good fit for an idea that has gone through many iterations in the last few years a from a highbrow biopic of the comics to the no-brow roots of its humor.In ""Stooges"" they have embraced the comic absurdity of the classic trio so wholeheartedly that its almost impossible not to be won over by the eye-poking head-slapping nose-twisting shenanigans that pepper nearly every scene. (Theres a funny disclaimer for kids at the end with two bodybuilder types claiming to be the Farrellys basically warning ""Dont do this at home."")Though technically set in present day everything about the film feels as if it was plucked out of the 40s the heyday of the comic shorts that would cement the Stooges in history including the clothes with Curlys always too short and too tight. The film itself is constructed to echo the shorts format with its three acts unfolding as three distinctly marked episodes all tied to the orphanage where theyre dropped off as babies. Before the last slap and the final ""Nyaaaaaahhhhh"" there will be an adoption to bungle an orphanage to destroy and save a beauty (Sofia Vergara) to distract them a murder to consider and a brief run at fame.The action begins when three toddlers a one bald one with a bowl haircut and one with a receding hairline surrounded by frizzy red curls a are tossed on the steps of the orphanage. In keeping with the 40s sensibility its a happy place run by good-hearted nuns with Jane Lynch as the long-suffering and ever forgiving Mother Superior keeping her ""Glee"" cynicism completely in check. Jennifer Hudson is Sister Rosemary and seems primarily there to periodically break out in song which the movie does when it feels like it. And best of all is a scene-stealing Larry David as Sister Mary-Mengele whos never met a moment that didnt offer some irritant to be squashed some optimism to be squelched.The guys may be babies but their DNA makes it clear they are already Stooges with an eye poke that sends Sister Mary-Mengele flying. From that point on the eye-poking and the eye-rolling never stop. As the boys grow up the head slaps and the rest of the highly choreographed hitting mayhem that characterizes all the Stooges interactions becomes the centerpiece of the movie. The success of the film hangs on pulling off the sight gags with the Farrellys getting the rhythm of a Stooges bit a basically action bad reaction then over-reaction a mostly right.Diamantopoulos a versatile stage actor who pops up frequently on TV is the films anchor as Moe. He doesnt just channel Moes irascibility but his underlying affection for Larry and Curly. On the physical front and in Stooge-land its ever present Sasso is the master. He was a regular on the Fox sketch comedy show ""MADtv"" and has impeccable timing from his finger snapping to his fearless pratfalls. There is great fun in the way that Curly never sees the next poke or slap coming. Hayes on the other hand as Larry seems to spend the film bracing for that next hit and he struggles even more with stupid.There is a plot (the brothers wrote the screenplay with Mike Cerrone) a as always the Stooges need a mission to mishandle a that requires them to make their way to the big city to try to save the orphanage but really it is there to allow them to bump and bungle a lot of current cultural references. They get themselves into various dicey situations including one with ""Jersey Shores"" the Situation but really there are no ""deep thoughts"" just another round of spats spills and sight gags including classics like all the ways a ladder and a wall can be played for laughs.Without question the movie is the most reverent work the irreverent Farrelly brothers have done with nary a trace of the filmmakers edgier side slipping into this family fare. For all the physical antics and the general stupidity that is a Stooges trademark its a strangely gentle comedy not quite the ridiculous laugh riot fans of the trio might expect but a very amusing escape from anything that resembles the real world.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSXSW 2013 Iggy Cafe Tacuba among nine shining moments so...March 15 2013TV This Week December 30 2012 - January 5 2013December 28 2012Hunger Games slaps Stooges sillyApril 16 2012Heavy metal for sequelOctober 10 2007The Three Stooges Character TestAugust 22 1999MORE STORIES ABOUTEyeThree StoogesOrphanageFarrelly BrothersCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-three-stooges-20120413,0,5561510.story",200,thethreestooges11,thethreestooges,latimes

But their knuckleheaded antics are set against a contemporary backdrop which makes them more absurdly funny. Pop culture references intermingle with the loopy trios iconic foolishness and the result is a movie with some big laughs plenty of heart and terrible coifs.Will Sasso is a hoot as the bald and doughy Curly Sean Hayes perfectly captures the elastic sour face of bushy-haired Larry and Chris Diamantopoulos nails the easily annoyed Moe with his distinctive bowl-shaped do.STORY Farrellys Three Stooges film gets back to trios rootsINTERACTIVE Meet the StoogesVIDEO The return of The Three StoogesThe threesome appears as babies on the doorstep of a Catholic orphanage where the nuns in charge promptly dub them ""angels from heaven."" Cut to 10 years later and the odd-looking cherubs are now shorter versions of their buffoonish manly selves.A chance for adoption comes up for Moe but he doesnt want to go without his two best buddies. So the three grow up together and are still a fixture at the orphanage at age 35. In their denim overalls they toil at their ""wirkshop"" doing odd jobs very oddly indeed.About the movieThe Three Stooges out of fourStars Sean Hayes Will Sasso Chris Diamantopoulos Sofia Vergara Jane Lynch Larry DavidDirector Bobby and Peter FarrellyDistributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG for slapstick action violence some rude and suggestive humor including language Running time 1 hour 31 minutes Opens Friday nationwideOff the job they sleep stacked up together snore in choral unison and get beaten at poker by small children.But this blissful existence comes to a halt when its announced that because of an economic downturn the orphanage will have to be shuttered. The Stooges wont have it. They vow to go out and raise the 830000 it will take to keep the operation going. As they skid off the orphanage grounds on their bicycle built for three Sister Rosemary (Jennifer Hudson) worries about how they will fare on the outside.""God will protect them says Mother Superior (Jane Lynch) ""because theyre pure of heart.""And dim of wit"" adds Sister Mary Mengele (a very funny Larry David in drag  er habit).The puns and turns of phrase are as ridiculously amusing as the physical gags. A few misadventures misfire but the orphanage antics are among the funnier moments as are the trios inane forays at a hospital a zoo and a ritzy garden party.Beneath the trios poking slapping and trademark vocal effects there is an innocent sweetness. And they can sing.In a rousing finale the guys warble The Spinners Its a Shame. Given Larry Curly and Moes propensity for fighting among themselves the lines are appropriately comical ""Its a shame the way you mess around with your men/Its a shame the way you hurt me.""But theres ""soitenly"" nothing shameful about The Three Stooges. Its an unexpected treat even for non-fans of the original trios slapstick comedy. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Its the Farrelly Brothers best since ""Theres Something About Mary"" Lets face it -- nobody was particularly enthusiastic about the idea of ""The Three Stooges."" For purists and fans of the original short films nobody could step into the shoes (and on the toes) of Moe Howard Larry Fine and Curly Howard. And anyone who never liked the Stooges in the first place certainly didnt have any interest in seeing a 21st-century version of the slapstick-y physical comedians. Get ready for something more shocking than a poke in the eye ""The Three Stooges"" is genuinely funny a no-holds-barred smart-stupid comedy that (at the screening I attended anyway) will win over Stooge-philes and non-believers alike. Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly (who co-wrote with frequent collaborator Mike Cerrone) have talked about a Stooges reboot for years but re-enacting legendary comedy bits with new performers is no easy task; just check out the truly bizarre 1992 comedy ""Brain Donors"" in which John Turturro attempts to channel Groucho in an unofficial remake of the Marx Brothers ""A Night at the Opera."" With ""Stooges"" however the Farrellys get the tone just right mixing classic tropes (ladder gags the disruption of fancy society parties a French pastry chef lamenting the destruction of his multi-tiered cake) with contemporary gags that seem like they wouldnt work but somehow do. As it turns out watching the cast of ""Jersey Shore"" get hit in the head repeatedly is both amusing and oddly cathartic. The film begins with three infants in a duffel bag getting heaved onto the front porch of an orphanage run by the kindly Mother Superior (Jane Lynch) with Sister Mary Mengele (Larry David) as the houses no-nonsense taskmaster. After an accident-fraught childhood the trio of foundlings grows up to be Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) Larry (Sean Hayes) and Curly (Will Sasso) who inflict as much damage upon each other as they do to their surroundings. When the orphanage faces foreclosure in true ""Blues Brothers"" style the trio sets out into the big bad world to raise the money to save the place. But once they leave the confines of the orphanage they find themselves caught up in a devious wifes murder scheme and in the even scarier world of reality television. This is silly business obviously which requires a certain amount of surrender on the part of the audience. No matter how many of the laughs stem from people being bopped on the bean or having their noggins slammed together however theres a lot of structure propping up all the wackiness. The script assembles a wonderfully intricate series of setups and payoffs perhaps the most in any movie since the equally dopey yet thoroughly underrated ""Rat Race"" a decade ago. Sad orphans a three-act structure those damn ""Jersey Shore"" kids -- these things should all be antithetical to a Three Stooges comedy but the Farrellys consistently find the laughs in a movie that puts them back on the level of ""Theres Something About Mary"" after a parade of disappointments like ""Hall Pass"" and their remake of ""The Heartbreak Kid."" Its no picnic for an actor to step into an iconic role but Diamantopoulos Sasso and especially Hayes really shine here -- theyre talented mimics to be sure but they also understand the timing and the personalities of the original Stooges. The new characters are lots of fun as well from Davids grouchy nun to Craig Bierkos hapless adulterer to Sofia Vergara taking the sight-gag value of her va-va-voomery to its logical conclusion. Shes practically the Jayne Mansfield of the modern age. Theres a strong chance youve already made up your mind that you wouldnt go see ""The Three Stooges"" on a bet -- it wouldnt have been high on my list if this werent my job -- but seriously throw caution to the wind on this one. Its funnier than a hammer to the skull. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint THE THREE STOOGES A few years back when the Farrelly brothers announced they were courting Russell Crowe Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn to play the Three Stooges it sounded like an audacious hoot. Imagining three absurdly overqualified master thespians brawling through a cheerfully chaotic gleefully vulgar tribute to cinemas premier lamebrains was a pleasure in itself. Now with a much-downsized cast of TV actors the project poses the question ""Why does this film exist?"" There is hardly a smidgeon of comic invention here. On the level of impersonation Sean Hayes makes a winningly daffy Larry his quirkiness unforced. Will Sasso throws himself unreservedly into the punching-ball role of Curly and Chris Diamantopolous huffs and puffs but never captures the original Moes nitroglycerine fury. To raise the fortune needed to save their orphanage alma mater the boys bumble into a plot hatched by a sexpot (Sofia Vergara) and her dim-bulb lover (Craig Bierko) to bump off her rich husband. That shaggy dog setup would have worked in the boys Great Depression heyday. Theres a kind of history diorama interest in seeing the Stooges ossified gags trotted out once more. When the Farrellys try to ""open up"" the story introducing the Stooges to the contemporary world of iPhones tweets and Kardashians the gags dont stick. A misguided subplot introducing a second troupe of idiots from an MTV reality series merely proves that too many schnooks spoil the broth. -COLIN COVERT  out of four stars Rated PG for action slapstick violence some rude and suggestive humor including language. RottenTomatoes.com read reviews Showtimes view listings LOCKOUT Peter Iovino 20th Century Fox ""The Three Stooges"" ""Lockout"" is a good news/bad news-but-mostly-bad news sort of movie. Set in 2079 it stars Guy Pearce as the standard wisecracking tough guy who jokes even when hes getting punched in the face. Pearce gets into his groove swiftly owns it and remains entertaining throughout. The rest of the movie however would work better as a video game. Theres plenty of repetitive action of the run/ hide/ shoot/ kill variety but its not visually interesting so youd probably have more fun operating the controller yourself. Pearce plays Snow a squinty bad-ass who gets sent to a formidable space prison for hard-core baddies including a truly deranged convict (Joseph Gilgun). When hell breaks loose at the prison during a visit by the presidents daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace ""Lost"") Snow agrees to rescue her to avoid incarceration. The mission is dangerous almost impossible and crazy tattooed freaks are trying to kill them at every turn but Snow and Emilie still find time for cute banter. Garden-variety explosions and gunfire only go so far. At least if you were playing it as a game ""Lockout"" would get you involved. As it is though watching it feels more like skirting the edge of a black hole. -CONNIE OGLE MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE  out of four stars Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action language including sexual references.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday April 12 2012 206 PM Title The Three Stooges Film Info PG Comic violence. At area theaters. Hey whats the big idea with ""The Three Stooges""? This wackily anachronistic movie from the Farrelly brothers (""Dumb amp; Dumber"" ""Theres Something About Mary"") takes the beloved -- by male comedy fans of a certain age anyway -- comedy trio whose heyday was the 1930s and 40s and reimagines them as the same eye-poking belly-bopping hijinks-creating goofs plopped in todays world. And just as in their once immensely popular short films todays world also has orphans in need of saving angry nuns and ladders that break apart. Its a concept that shouldnt work at all. But -- whoda thunk it? -- its better than a hammer to the head. Thats mostly due to some inspired casting which thankfully does not include big names like Sean Penn and Jim Carrey two stars who expressed interest when directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly first announced this project over a decade ago. Will Sasso (""MadTV"") is a spot-on Curly and Sean Hayes (""Will amp; Grace"") is a dead ringer for Larry. Seriously folks these two are uncanny. If Chris Diamantopoulos isnt quite as short and scowly as Moe at least he has the voice and hair right. Abandoned as kids the Stooges here grow up in an orphanage tormenting the croaky Sister Mary-Mengele (a Borscht Belt-funny Larry David in penguin nun garb) the saintly Sister Rosemary (Jennifer Hudson) and the patient Mother Superior (Jane Lynch). Years later the orphans -- including one tomboy whos dyin from an unstated 1930s-style movie sickness -- will be thrown out on their ears due to no cash. So Moe Larry and Curly leave to see wholl pony up to save the kids. They stumble into a moider plot involving a sexpot (Sofia Vergara) and her boyfriend (Craig Bierko) but the movie -- divided into three segments with Stooge-specific titles like ""More Orphan Than Not"" -- is about getting bonked on the head by rubber hammers and introducing a new generation to classic lines like ""nyuck-nyuck-nyuck"" and ""woo-woo-woo-wooo"" The Farrellys and their co-writer Mike Cerrone are happy as clams just throwing all the classic Stooge bits into a stew and seeing what cooks. (They never add Shemp for extra flavor.) There are no bio-pic elements as in the ""Stooges"" TV movie from 2000 or the Andy Kaufman vivisection ""Man on the Moon."" Theres just some great imitations of what remains an acquired taste. All of which could make this movie as the man with the bowl haircut once said the smartest imbecile youve ever seen.

"Three Stooges Review Nyuks outnumber laughs - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Nyuks outnumber laughs in Three Stooges  The Three Stooges Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Both sincerely affectionate and a tad eerie the Farrelly brothers""The Three Stooges""wonders what itd be like to arm the most violent comedians of the 20th century with their familiar implements of comic torture against a modern-day setting where sadistic slapstick has become as common as an unfunny ""Hangover"" sequel.This retro exercise has been a long time coming. For a while the Farrellys -- best known for ""Theres Something About Mary"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" -- attracted the interest of various A-listers including Sean Penn Jim Carrey and Benicio Del Toro. The trio they ended up with lacks star wattage but its very solid. Will Sassos Curly hews closely to the Curly we know in the nyuk and woo-woo-woo-woo-woo department. Chris Diamantopoulos has a leaner face than Moe Howards but he gets the boiling-point grimace down pat. (The bowl cut doesnt hurt.) Top-billed Sean Hayes from TVs ""Will amp; Grace"" scores an improbable triumph as Larry his adenoidally weary vocal inflections right on the money.So thats a start. But absurdly brutal slapstick is a tough thing to sustain across a feature. I spent a lot of ""The Three Stooges"" staring not laughing. For me this was a stare-out-loud affair. The script by the Farrellys and Mike Cerrone tosses the infant Stooges at the doorstep of an orphanage where Jane Lynch plays the kindly Mother Superior and Larry David in wimple drag plays the mean nun just waiting to get clocked and bonked and banged around. The orphanage is threatened with foreclosure; to raise the 830000 the boys bravely venture out into the real adult world for the first time.""What is that gadget?"" one of the Stooges asks. ""Its an iPhone"" comes the answer and in one of the better jokes Curly sticks his eye up to it and bellows ""Hello? Hello??""Aptly ""The Three Stooges"" tells its story in three parts as separate short films adding up to a feature. Less aptly the pathos involving a mortally ill child at the orphanage and the Stooges underlying love for one another can get pretty brutal. The sentimentality often feels at odds with the protracted unevenly executed set pieces relying on wrench-conks and hot irons to the chest.Also the anachronisms chafe. While it certainly (or soitenly) fills time to have Moe become a cast member of ""Jersey Shore"" and yank the nose hairs out of one cast member while giving Snooki the eye-poke its kind of Huh? Wha? Even with its drab and generic visual quality the film has its moments -- theres a genuinely funny visual joke involving farm-raised salmon for example -- but to really dig the Farrellys tribute to the Stooges you have to be more of a fan of the old stuff than I am. Remember ""Brain Donors"" from 1992? It was an attempt valiant but limited to recapture the magic and the dynamic of the Marx Brothers with John Turturro more or less ""doing"" Groucho. ""The Three Stooges"" amounts to the same sort of cover-band project.mjphillipstribune.comThe Three Stooges -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG (for slapstick action violence some rude and suggestive humor including language)Running time 132Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment The Three Stooges (movie) John Turturro Will Sasso Chris Diamantopoulos Nicole Polizzi Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0411-three-stooges-20120412,0,632377.column",200,thethreestooges16,thethreestooges,chicagotribune

Widely read by troubled parents -- and by their kids because of the lurid panels of disfigurement and dismemberment Wertham used to illustrate his thesis -- the book served as a form of literary McCarthyism that defiled the robust artistry of a significant form of mid-century popular culture. (Translation I was a kid then I loved those comics and I somehow survived them.) A more suitable case for study in the 1950s would have been the seismic influence of The Three Stooges on the juvenile delinquency that flourished at the time. It cannot have been mere chance that the airing of the Stooges old short films on local TV stations coincided with a rise in sadist-destructive impulses among young males underage crime flagrant disrespect for adults and the poking of classmates eyes accompanied by the teen-terrorist mantra ""Nyuk nyuk."" Exposure at an impressionable age to the face-slapping hair-pulling antics of the prime Stooge trio -- Moe Howard his brother Curly (Jerome) and their partner Larry Fine -- surely sowed seeds for a generation that a few years later tried to reap anarchy in America. (Translation I didnt think the Stooges shorts were funny; and what doesnt make me laugh makes me angry.) (READ The Glory and Horror of EC Comics) Hyperbole aside its no exaggeration to say that some of the boys weaned on the Stooges grew up to make roundhouse movies that put a premium on pain as a tool of comedy. What are Animal House Porkys American Pie and half of the Judd Apatow canon if not repositories to the infantile male hostilities on display in the Cinema of Stooge? Now in the nakedest homage yet Peter and Bobby Farrelly the Rhode Island siblings who used to own a near-monopoly on rude movie humor (Dumb amp; Dumber Theres Something About Mary) have perpetrated a feature-length tribute to the short-film trio and called it with ardor overwhelming ingenuity The Three Stooges. In their day Moe Larry and Curly (joined by Moe and Curlys brother Shemp in 1946 after Curly suffered a stroke) were among the least celebrated of comedy teams. Critics loved the Marx Brothers tolerated the Ritz Brothers and ignored or scorned the Stooges. In 1937 a critic in the Motion Picture Herald divided movie audiences into two groups ""one composed of persons who laugh at The Three Stooges and the other made up of those who wonder why."" Even Leonard Maltin the B-movie historian and trash-comedy enthusiast opens his Stooges chapter in the book Movie Comedy Teams with the mildest of encomiums he pegs the trio as ""talented experienced comedians who deserve recognition if only for longevity."" (MORE Rare Behind-the-Scenes Photos of The Three Stooges) Give them credit for sticking around. Like the most reliable workers at the Pink Slime factory these veteran vaudevillians ground out about eight two-reelers a year at Columbia Pictures for a quarter century from 1934 to 1958 and didnt graduate to feature-film stardom until Columbia closed its short-films department. In their productivity rigid format and emphasis on violent comedy the Stooge shorts might be compared to the Warner Bros. cartoons of the same period -- except that animation directors Tex Avery Bob Clampett Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones often turned mayhem into masterpieces while the Stooges psychopathy steered clear of ambition and artistry. (READ Corlisss tribute to Chuck Jones and the Warner Bros cartoons) Almost always the plots plopped Moe (with the bowl haircut and shortest fuse) Larry (a dim bulb sporting Einsteins frantic coiffure) and Curly (a smart physical comedian with a buzz cut) into some bastion of propriety to raise wholly hell. Some of their better early films have them invading an art class in Pop Goes the Easel a society party in Ants in the Pantry where they drop rodents down the dresses of the debs and a hospital in their one Oscar-nominated short Men in Black. (These can be found on the DVD The Three Stooges Collection Vol. 1 1934-1936.) Occasionally the set pieces are as sharp as the Stooges are dumb thanks to the rough craftsmanship of directors Del Lord and Charley Chase and writers Felix Adler and Clyde Bruckman -- a famous gagman for three decades and co-director of Buster Keatons immortal silent comedy The General. (After writing his final Stooges short in 1955 Bruckman borrowed a pistol from Keaton and blew his brains out.) (READ Corlisss tribute to Buster Keaton and Fatty Arbuckle) Rarely interrupted by the musical numbers that gave audience a gentle pause amid the chaos of Marx Brothers movies the Stooges shorts raced from one indignity to another -- often visited on stuffed shirts more frequently on themselves. Nor did the films bother with romantic subplots a must in feature-length comedies of the time. Stooges pictures had no heart; they only had time for the pain. And the punishment was quickly inflicted instantly forgotten immediately repeated. When Moe would gouge Curlys eyes or Larry answer a slap with a harder smack nobody ran for shelter or skulked away. The Stooges were the movies form of commedia dell-arte puppets with no feelings to hurt. You have noticed that my recent viewing of a few dozen Stooges shorts has slightly mellowed my old antagonism -- just in time to see the Farrellys feature as an unworthy tribute. Written a decade ago the project was originally envisioned for an all-star cast Benicio Del Toro (or Hank Azaria or Johnny Knoxville) as Moe Sean Penn (or Andy Samberg) as Larry and Jim Carrey as Curly. That plan never bloomed and the brothers wound up with Sean Hayes (flamboyantly gay Jack on Will amp; Grace) in the Larry role and the much-lesser-known Chris Diamantopoulos (Frank Sinatra on the miniseries The Kennedys) as Moe and Will Sasso (who looks like a jollier James Gandolfini and impersonated him in Sopranos spoofs on MAD TV) as Curly. The movies audience should be divided between those who would like to have seen the Del Toro-Penn-Carrey version and those who wonder why the Farrellys bothered to make this one. (READ A Brief History of Slapstick Humor) Set mostly in the present day and photographed in blinding color instead of the crisp black-and-white of the shorts The Three Stooges is broken into three ""episodes"" of about 27 minute each. (An actual Stooges film ran 15 to 20 minutes.) It begins a quarter century ago at the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage -- ""founded 1934"" -- run by a chipper Mother Superior (Jane Lynch) with the strict Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David of Curb Your Enthusiasm in immaculate drag) as Prefect of Discipline. Young Curly (Robert Capron) Larry (Lance Chantiles-Wertz) and Moe (Skyler Gisondo) already suffer from criminal-comic dementia. But when Moe is improbably adopted he refuses to join his new family unless the other two can come along which gets him a return ticket to the orphanage. Flash-forward to the present day as the orphanage faces closing due to 830000 in unpaid medical bills incurred by the trio. The grown-up but still arrested-development Stooges resolve to leave home raise the money and save the Sisters. Already were deep into the sort of sappy sentiment the original Stooges would have butt-kicked off the screen. Theirs was a ruthless Cinema of Cruelty; this is whimsy with a coating of corrosion. Stumbling into the scheme of a sexy predatress (Sofia Vergara) who is using her boyfriend (Craig Bierko) to kill off her rich husband (Kirby Heyborne) the Stooges are goofs with soft spots and not just in their heads. In the Christian sense theyre fools for Christ virtually every bit of violence they cause is for the greater good of bailing out the nuns and their adorable charges. (LIST All-TIME 100 Movies) A couple of decent set pieces -- one inflicting severe vehicular pain on the boyfriend other using hot irons as defibrillators on a cops chest -- are the most distant approximations of gags from early Stooge shorts. Guest shots from the famous (Dreamgirls Jennifer Hudson as a singing nun) the infamous (the cast of Jersey Shore) and the libidinous (Sports Illustrated swimsuit icon Kate Upton as a nun who finally gets out of the habit) cant save the movie from its deficiency in star quality. Indeed the purpose of the entire enterprise seems to demonstrate the superiority of slapstick sadism from 75 years ago to the wan attempts at PG-rated roughhouse today. Can somebody please fund a study on the debilitating effects of the worst modern comedies on the collective sense of humor of todays youth? Id guess that the Farrellys and their comedy kin are committing a true seduction of the innocent. (Translation The original trio was worlds funnier than this or these Three Stooges.)

TWITTER Stars Chris Diamantopoulos Will Sasso and Sean Hayes are on the money as Moe Curly and Larry in a film containing more plot and sentiment than the boys shorts ever had. The boinks pokes slaps nyuk-nyuks and nyaaahhhs mostly sound right and hit their marks in The Three Stooges the Farrelly Brothers funny good-hearted resuscitation of Hollywoods beloved lowbrow lunkheads. Gestating for so long it nearly qualifies as a dream project finally come to fruition this boisterous and affectionate comedy has more plot and sentiment than the boys shorts ever had in their 30s-40s heyday but the winning cast and sympathetic spirit almost immediately strip away any skepticism long-term hardcore fans might carry in with them. While older aficionados and young kids should be on board with this PG-rated Fox release the main commercial question mark perhaps centers upon 30ish viewers with a Stooge gap too young to have grown up on syndicated TV broadcasts but too old to have had their childhoods enhanced by the DVD repackagings. PHOTOS Behind the Scenes of The Three Stooges Casting was always the big issue with this long-simmering venture. For years Peter and Bobby Farrelly were courting big names to play the boys including the likes of Russell Crowe Benicio Del Toro Sean Penn Jim Carrey and Paul Giamatti. After a while it seemed as though this was a film that was never meant to be. The happy ending however is that the less-known Chris Diamantopoulos Will Sasso and Sean Hayes are entirely on the money as Moe Curly and Larry respectively nailing the voices carrying off the essential familiar moves with aplomb and in Hayes case even bringing a little something extra to the least-defined Stooge. Although the original team always wanted to make feature-length films (but never did until very late in the game and never with Curly) Columbia boss Harry Cohn probably rightly judged that their one-dimensional brand of physical comedy would play best in a short format. The Farrellys cleverly address this issue by dividing their 92-minute farce into three related episodes the first of which presents the threesome as young boys anxious to be adopted from the rural Sisters of Mercy Orphanage where they were dropped as tykes in a burlap bag. The Mother Superior (Jane Lynch) and her associate with the immortal name of Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David in drag) spend decades trying to unload the inseparable trio who do menial work around the grounds that allows the actors to begin strutting their comic stuff with the same sorts of props -- hammers mallets saws ladders wood beams bicycles fire hydrants a church bell and so on -- with which the originals wreaked such havoc (the prominently displayed founding date for the orphanage 1934 marks the year the Stooges began their tenure at Columbia). VIDEO The Three Stooges Trailer With the institution deeply in debt Episode 2 entitled ""The Bananas Split"" sees the boys unleashed upon the big city (Atlanta in point of fact) where they have resolved to come up with the 830000 required to save the orphanage from ruin. On the promise of ample reward they become embroiled in a murder scheme perpetrated by illicit lovers (Sofia Vergara who gets a boob thoughtlessly stepped upon at one point with sonic accentuation and Craig Bierko) against the womans wealthy husband (Kirby Heyborne) the fallout from which quickly leads to a hospital which provides a setting bulging with comic possibilities. For at least the 25 years since Three Men and a Baby the gag of babies peeing up into the faces of adults trying to change their diapers has been desperately unwelcome. However the sight of the Stooges brandishing a nursery full of straight-shooting bambini like so many squirt guns gives the joke a new lease on life. Men encased in body casts are shown no mercy nor is a man who gets fresh with Curly when hes disguised as a nurse. A massive slap-fest designed it would seem to incorporate nearly every classic move in the Stooge playbook directly leads to the films strangest interlude which has Moe enlisted to join the cast of Jersey Shore. The mop heads interactions with Snooki The Situation and the rest of them are more weird than actually funny -- Moe and the reality-show denizens dont seem to occupy the same universe or century -- though it is not unamusing to see him administering well-placed pokes and jabs to the TV layabouts. The nuttiness climaxes at a lavish upscale party that just begs to have its balloon punctured by the Stooges posing as hired help. PHOTOS 28 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies In an era of defined by extreme R-rated Hangover humor and Jackass-style physical punishment The Three Stooges is mild indeed. Still there were many parents who in the old days wouldnt allow their kids to watch Moe Curly and Larry for fear that their tots would start hammering away at one another or take pliers to their friends teeth. Even now some of the gags are still alarming enough to have prompted the Farrellys to add a clever postscript revealing how their ""weapons"" are made of rubber and admonishing younguns not to imitate what theyve just seen. Given the indelible figures cut by real-life brothers Moe and Jerry (Curly) Howard and Larry Fine its a real tribute to Diamantopoulos Sasso and Hayes how quickly one is willing to accept then embrace the actors as these iconic characters. Physical resemblance enabled by extensive makeup wigs and costumes is the easy part. But vocally theyre also spot-on and Sasso is able to execute all of Curlys famous moves including spinning on the ground with graceful precision. They may not be the real things but if the matches were any closer youd suspect resurrection or cloning. Production Conundrum Entertainment Charles B.

The Three Stooges Bad Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly. Cast Sean Hayes Chris Diamantopolous Will Sasso. Rating PG for slapstick violence and rude and suggestive humor including language. Hey dont knock it. Theres a place for that sort of thing. But the film ""The Three Stooges"" couldnt find it with a GPS unit. Although the Farrelly brothers have updated the Stooges dragging them kicking and screaming and eye gouging into the present -- and hiring Larry David as a nun -- the movie is content to simply mimic the old Stooges bringing nothing new to the table. Thats not entirely true actually. The Farrellys manage to work into the story MTVs ""Jersey Shore"" and its characters who make the Stooges look like Albert Einstein Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates. But Im not sure that really counts as a welcome innovation. Goody Three Stooges Comics clowns freedom fighters Three Stooges talk becoming Moe Larry and Curly The film is told in three episodes which counts for clever here. We first meet Moe Larry and Curly as babies dropped off on the doorstep of an orphanage run by nuns including Mother Superior (Jane Lynch) Sister Rosemary (Jennifer Hudson) and Sister Mary-Mengele (David). The kids immediately prove themselves to be violent incorrigible and stupid traits they will not outgrow as they get older. Moe almost gets adopted but the adoption falls through in a way that will resonate later. So by the time they are grown up Moe (Chris Diamantopoulous) Larry (Sean Hayes) and Curly (Will Sasso) are still living at the orphanage wreaking havoc. Then one day Monsignor Ratliffe (Brian Doyle-Murray) shows up and announces that unless someone comes up with more than 800000 the place will close by the end of the month. So the Stooges decide to set out into the world to try to come up with the money. This is the part where you would say ""Hilarity ensues"" but it doesnt. Instead the trio get involved in a ludicrous murder plot cooked up by a woman named Lydia (Sofia Vergara) that will somehow lead back to the main plot; astounding coincidence is a common device in the movie. Which can be fine if its used to good comedic effect. Here it just seems lazy. By the time Moe joins the cast of ""Jersey Shore"" youre likely to have long since given up caring. There are some funny individual bits -- Kardashian jokes never disappoint no matter how obvious -- and a few of the sight gags work. Its a fun cast but with the exception of David whose casting seems inspired in this context only Sasso seems to be having a good time; perhaps thats a function of the Curly character. Hayes seems flat-out miserable playing Larry as if he suffers from a constant stomachache which isnt exactly the trait you want in a Stooge. In the end you wonder what the point of the whole enterprise is. It has taken years for a Stooges movie to get to the big screen. Youd think that after all that time maybe the Farrellys who have made funny movies (""Theres Something About Mary"" ""Kingpin"") would have come up with something better. Instead you wish theyd spent a little more time to try to get it right. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

Leave it to a sibling comedy duo to recognize the potential for brotherly love amid the Three Stooges slap-happy antics adding a welcome heartwarming dynamic to the gangs signature eye-poking head-knocking routine. In Foxs ""The Three Stooges"" co-directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly tone down the abuse without compromising the numbskulls unique style of physical comedy making for an unexpectedly pleasant yet unapologetically lowbrow outing true to the spirit that has made the trio such an enduring comedy fixture since its bigscreen debut in 1930. Brand recognition and warm word of mouth should win over wary parents for a midrange success. Considering the blowback any time a surrogate stepped in to fill one of the original Stooges shoes (remember Shemp?) it couldnt have been easy to find three actors capable of doing justice to the highly imitable but seldom matched mannerisms of Moe Larry and Curly. Audiences already know longtime ""Will amp; Grace"" co-star Sean Hayes whom a scowling expression and equally unflattering wig transforms into permanently befuddled Larry and versatile ""Mad TV"" comic Will Sasso whose closely shaved head becomes an all-purpose battering ram as Curly. The discovery here is Greek-Canadian Chris Diamantopoulos who nails the fast-talking Moes cheeky New York accent (no small feat considering that English is the thesps second language). As if to simulate a latenight marathon of ""Three Stooges"" shorts the film is divided into three continuous episodes. The first dubbed ""More Orphan Than Not"" serves as a revisionist origin story for the trio opening with their arrival via duffel bag on the front stoop of an orphanage operated by nuns. The sisters range in appearance and disposition from the beatific Sister Bernice (Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Kate Upton) to the draconian Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David in drag) with Jennifer Hudson thrown in for good measure as the quick-to-sing Sister Rosemary. After a few ""Little Rascals""-style scenes in which pint-sized moppets play the 10-year-old misfits their ridiculous hairstyles and personalities already very much in place the story jumps forward to find the now-adult Stooges still living under the nuns roof. But fortunes have changed in 35 years and the orphanage is now saddled with heavy debts. Unless the three can raise 830000 in a months time theyll be forced to fend for themselves though escalating in-fighting suggests a rift among the brothers (the subject of the last two episodes ""The Bananas Split"" and ""No Moe Mister Nice Guy""). Wherever they go the Stooges can be relied upon to turn any environment -- including a maternity ward packed with full-bladdered infants -- into a dangerous playground for slapstick shenanigans. While the story may be stock and the laughs unsophisticated its hard not to admire the convoluted mix of puns and mock pugilism that make up their routine a throwback to the vaudeville tradition from which their act emerged back in the 20s. As with the Marx Brothers the key to making the Stooges work is to surround them with straight men -- humorless authority figures incapable of going about their business in the presence of such idiocy. As Mother Superior Jane Lynch is a perfect example denying her own considerable comic gifts to give the boys more room to shine. The instant the supporting cast starts to act funny however the dynamic shifts toward farce as when a buxom gold-digger (Sofia Vergara) enlists the Stooges to murder her husband (Kirby Heyborne). While best known for pushing the envelope on gross-out humor co-directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly are softies at heart having quietly spent the past two decades shifting audience attitudes toward mentally and physically challenged characters onscreen (including actors with disabilities in ""Theres Something About Mary"" and ""Shallow Hal"" among others). Whereas many who grew up watching ""The Three Stooges"" now wince at the thought of their mean-spirited antics the Farrellys have the right attitude to make their buffoonery bearable. In early scenes among the nuns the adolescent Stooges come across as precocious pranksters but as adults they are clearly stunted kids -- a variation on the popular man-child trend. And lest anyone think ""The Three Stooges"" reruns represent the lowest form of television programming the Farrellys slyly enlist the cast members of ""The Jersey Shore"" to play themselves allowing Moe to knock some sense into the reality-show wastrels. If some degree of schadenfreude is key to appreciating the Stooges abusive escapades then watching Snooki and the Situation get slapped around goes a long way toward satisfying grownups while sparing the need for racy double entendres and other tacky tricks. Production values are pro with timing -- in choreography editing and silly sound effects -- consistently triggering the guffaws. An amusing coda in which Antonio Sabato Jr. and Justin Lopez introduce themselves as the films directors and proceed to deliver a ""dont try this at home"" message puts the PG-rated violence in proper context.

A little nyuk-nyuk-nyuk goes a long way in ""The Three Stooges"" Peter and Bobby Farrellys feature-length homage to the classic slapstick comedy trio.The Farrelly brothers have wanted to make this movie for years and for the most part they didnt try to inflict their signature gross-out sensibility upon known and revered source material. Yes there is a scene in which Moe Larry and Curly get into a urine fight by pointing naked newborns at each other in a maternity ward. And Curly does pass some major gas but its actually relevant from a plot perspective.As directors and writers (with screenplay help from their boyhood friend Mike Cerrone) the Farrellys have shown surprising restraint. Their ""Three Stooges"" is sweeter than you might expect and its certainly more tolerable than their last movie the crass ""Hall Pass"" from last year.But its hard to imagine who the film is for today beyond hardcore fans of the original shorts and 10-year-old boys who double over giggling at the sight of grown men doubling over in pain. Despite its brisk pace and brief running time and even with its episodic structure -- the film is broken up into three individual episodes with a through line that unites them -- ""The Three Stooges"" grows very old very quickly.There are a few cute ideas though and some clever casting choices. Every once in a while a pun is good for a chuckle. But the head-bonking and the eye-poking the face-slapping and the finger-snapping and the constant clang of sound effects are too much to bear over an extended period of time. If anything the Farrellys ""Three Stooges"" might make you want to go back and revisit the original threesome -- in short doses -- for a reminder of how influential their brand of comedy has become.These adventures take place in the present day though as Larry (""Will amp; Grace"" star Sean Hayes in a wild wig) Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos of ""24"" and ""The Kennedys"") and Curly (Will Sasso of ""MADtv"") are still living at the orphanage where they were dumped as infants despite the fact that theyre now grown men in their mid-30s. That is one amusing gag As time passes different actors play the threesome at various ages but the nuns who raised them stay exactly the same. And these three actors are doing nearly dead-on impressions of Larry Fine and Moe and Curly Howard rather than going in a knowing post-modern direction with the characters.Jane Lynch in a departure from her famous snark plays the kindly Mother Superior; Larry David is a sight to behold as her sidekick the cranky Sister Mary-Mengele (shes essentially Larry David in a nuns habit). One day they inform the Stooges and the other orphans that their home will be shut down if they cant come up with 830000 in the next month.And so our intrepid (and naive) trio ventures out into the big wide world a place theyve never seen before to try and raise the money. Fish-out-of-water antics some hurt feelings and massive bodily injuries ensue. (The Farrellys did this better back in 1996 with Randy Quaid as an innocent Amish bowling prodigy who goes on a cross-country tour in ""Kingpin."")They get mixed up with a femme fatale (Sofia Vergara) who hires them to kill her rich husband so that she can run away with her lover; naturally this does not go nearly as planned. (On a side note It would be nice to see Vergara play a character besides a saucy temptress once in a while.)Attempts at contemporizing the Stooges are hit-and-miss -- the reality show they stumble onto is just cringe-inducingly awkward -- but theyre ""soitenly"" never mean. And thats sayin somethin.""The Three Stooges"" a 20th Century Fox release is rated PG for slapstick action violence and some rude and suggestive humor including language. Running time 91 minutes.

(April 12 2012) Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Moe Larry and Curly try to save their childhood orphanage without any idea what theyre doing. BOTTOM LINE Listen porcupine its the Stooges. And the Farrelly Brothers. So choose accordingly. CAST Chris Diamantopoulos Will Sasso Sean Hayes Larry David Sofia Vergara Jane Lynch LENGTH 132 The predilection for pure idiocy that runs through American culture has few finer exemplars than the Farrelly Brothers Peter and Bobby whose misshapen body of work includes ""Theres Something About Mary"" and ""Dumb amp; Dumber."" But even the Farrellys genuflect in the presence of the Howards Moe and Curly and their co-conspirator Larry Fine whose long-gone comedy act has inspired one of the Farrellys better films and a movie in which excess -- the hallmark of everyone involved -- is decidedly a virtue. ""The Three Stooges"" long awaited and long delayed is a virtual clone job Chris Diamantopoulos Sean Hayes and Will Sasso as Moe Larry and Curly mimic the trademark tics groans and barking of an act first defined around 1934 -- the same year coincidentally as the founding of the movies Sisters of Mercy Orphanage. Having been dumped there in a duffel bag thrown from a speeding car the boys grow up in its sheltered confines driving the sisters (including the terrific Jennifer Hudson and Jane Lynch) to distraction and vow to save the place when the nuns fall on hard times. As plot devices go its not very original but it gives the Farrellys the excuse they need to impose the trio on an outside world where they inflict mayhem and chaos on everyone they meet. And of course each other.

In addition to the inspired impersonations of the lead trio ""The Three Stooges"" is blessed with a terrific supporting cast notably Larry David whose Sister Mary-Mengele is the stuff of Catholic school nightmares and ""Modern Familys"" Sofia Vergara whose character is trying to hoodwink the boys into killing her husband. Nothing in the movie however is quite as satisfying as Moes enlistment on ""Jersey Shore"" where he becomes a star while subjecting the shows regular cast to a series of ploinks boinks and nose tweaks.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Like a freshness experiment in how long comedy can keep the Farrelly brothers The Three Stooges places its titular trio now played by Sean Hayes (Larry) Will Sasso (Curly) and Chris Diamantopoulos (Moe) in the present day pretty much unchanged. They arent explained away as time travelers or characters sucked out of a TV and into real life; theyre just three man-children with odd haircuts and old-fashioned wardrobes using words like ""youse"" and engaging in elaborate pratfalls. To make this divide even more evident the trio is placed in the company of terribly contemporary types like Jane Lynch (playing a nun) Jennifer Hudson (playing another nun) and the cast of Jersey Shore (playing themselves if you want to call it that). The Three Stooges isnt very funny but it is like last years far superior The Muppets a sincere act of fandom on an epic scale. The plot which involves Sofia Vergara as a murderous femme fatale and the saving of the boys childhood home is there only to usher the Stooges through basic locations--orphanage city street hospital fancy party--that serve as backdrops for their bits of action. And even those who have never seen one of the original Three Stooges shorts will know what that entails heads clunking together eye-pokes whoop-oop-oop-oop and nyuk nyuk nyuk all with cartoon-style sound effects. (When someone steps on Vergaras breast for leverage for instance it makes a honking noise.) The faith the Farrellys have in the lasting entertainment value of this specific brand of vaudeville-born physical comedy is touching if misguided. The Stooges work may well be timeless but that doesnt mean it can be easily transferred. This will probably be the first Stooges exposure for the films intended audience (its aimed young enough that theres a disclaimer at the end in which the ""directors"" played by two ex-soap-opera stars explain the stunts are faked) and its hard to imagine theyll be able to focus on the gags and not the weird disjointed rest of the movie. While many of those jokes fall flat (a scene involving baby urine goes on for what feels like six to seven hours) theyre still better than the surrounding material which is shot in an ugly ineffectual way that looks like it was thrown together in someones backyard down to the makeup visible on the actors faces. How did they make Vergara look so awful? Though since she took this role obviously she wasnt that concerned.
