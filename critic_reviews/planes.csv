Its an endearing enough David-and-Goliath tale aimed squarely at younger kids as smalltown crop-dusting plane Dusty (Dane Cook) leaves behind the day job to enter a global aerial race that takes him from the US to Iceland from India to Mexico. Dusty is assisted by some longtime mechanical buddies and coached by a retired warplane. His fellow contestants include Bulldog (John Cleese) a Brit with a stiff upper nose cone and Ripslinger a sly American who cant bear the thought of being beaten by Dusty. Planes isnt a Pixar film even if its related to one (Disney bought Pixar in 2006) and theres nothing groundbreaking about the animation or script. That said the characters and story still offer low-key charms.

Dusty Crophopper (voiced by Dane Cook) is a single-prop crop-duster in the tiny town of Radiator Springs Propwash Junction who daydreams of flying far and fast. ""Ive flown thousands of miles but Ive never been anywhere"" he cries to manure-hauling compatriot Leadbottom (Cedric the Entertainer) but heres the kicker Dustys afraid of heights That wont keep him from attempting to qualify for the Wings Around the Globe race with the help of dumb fat fuel truck friend Mater Chug (Brad Garrett) and crusty mentor Doc Skipper (Stacy Keach). Much like last months ""Turbo"" and countless other toons before that ""Planes"" incorporates any number of ethnic stereotypes for maximum international appeal -- a Latin lover wearing a lucha libre mask named El Chupacabra for example -- while teaching wee ones that they can surely achieve their dreams granted that they best their cocky idols and endure severe body transformations along the way. (Much is made of Dustys reluctance to have his sprayer surgically removed. Good luck explaining that one folks.) The fun doesnt stop there characters toss around pun-powered slang like ""Lugnut up"" and ""Why dont you go plow yourself?"" while a convertible flying car is greeted warily as a schizophrenic because if theres one thing that kids love with their ""Midnight Cowboy"" references (yes really) its shoutouts to mental illness. While the adults in the audience get to preoccupy themselves with the still-eerie logic of the ""Cars""/""Planes"" universe where planes fly within one another to get places and still somehow built a Statue of Liberty in their own image the kids should be placated by the close calls bright colors and wacky accents by the likes of Cook Keach Julia Louis-Dreyfus Teri Hatcher John Cleese Priyanka Chopra Carlos Alazraqui Roger Craig Smith and -- in an admittedly inspired touch -- Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards as fighter jets. The intercontinental intrigue shouldnt stun them just as the valuable lessons about teamwork and self-worth (spoiler alert?) wont blow minds. Everything about Klay Halls direction and Jeffrey M. Howards screenplay aims to make a minimal impact and given the projects origins as a direct-to-video venture one is hardly surprised. Only the sight of Chug shamelessly hawking Dustys merchandise feels actively aware of ""Planes"" own thorough disposability as a money-making machine. When Chopras sleek Indian temptress makes a nod to Hindu culture by saying that ""many believe that we will be recycled as tractors"" one is tempted to remind her that technically this will all be recycled as ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" next summer then as ""Boats"" then as ""Trains"" and then maybe as ""Tractors.""

So why does it feel so third-hand? (DISNEY) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 09 2013 at 525 AM updated August 09 2013 at 526 AM comments Halfway through ""Planes"" a little car shows up towing wings behind him. Hes both an automobile and an airplane he explains -- a weird ungainly little hybrid of which only six were made. Well Disney just made another one. Its new movie a title tells us is part of the ""World of Cars"" -- an apparently broad new franchise based on the first ""Cars"" movie in which every mode of transport has big eyes and a huge dream. Boy I just cant wait for ""Ferries."" In the meantime though here comes this. And you can see the appeal for little kids who just love playing vroom-vroom around the living room. Also for merchandisers who love playing Just How Much More Junk Can We Cram Into Toystores? But in reality the new film is just a thin copy of ""Cars"" and ""Cars 2"" -- and frankly neither of them was that wonderful to begin with. Of course the character design -- which was unfortunately Pixars worst -- remains. The vehicles windshields double as eyes. There are no sharp edges or rich textures. Everything is as round and shiny as a pacifier. But the story is even slighter -- like a Mad Libs version of the first ""Cars"" scripts with merely some nouns changed. So is there a grumpy grandfatherly mentor as in ""Cars""? Yes. And an awkward untutored truck as a sidekick? Check. Do we have an international race as we did in ""Cars 2""? You bet. Complete with national stereotypes of the various foreign entries? But of course senor. Of course its not as if anybody besides a compulsive critic really remembers the plots of the ""Cars"" movies but the recycling is proof of the slightly slipshod nature of the whole project. Eh they liked it before theyll like it again. Just put wings on the things. At least the first ""Cars"" movie has some distinctive voices giving the story a slight advantage though. Here instead of Owen Wilson as the hero we get the bland Dane Cook. And instead of Paul Newman as a crusty advisor were handed -- Stacy Keach. These are dinner-theater substitutions at best. Brad Garrett at least gives a little life to his part as the sidekick. And its a cute idea to bring on Anthony Edwards and Val Kilmer as a couple of fighter planes although the joke is too fleeting to make an impression even on adults whod remember them from ""Top Gun."" But other than that its strictly by the numbers from the believe-in-yourself moral to the purely predictable ending. Small children probably wont mind. The ones I saw at my screening certainly didnt and although this Disneyfied cartoon adds bathroom jokes that Pixar would never have stooped to it also picks up the pace considerably. Once the race starts and the main characters take off the movie does too -- at least for little ones. But if youre one of their adult companions? Put your seat in a reclining position. And pray for in-flight beverage service. Ratings note The film contains some mildly vulgar humor. Planes (PG) Disney (92 min.) Directed by Klay Hall. With the voices of Dane Cook Brad Garrett Stacy Keach.

Credit Walt Disney Pictures Not so long ago if you bought a ticket to an animated childrens movie you could expect to spend 90 minutes watching a princess slowly fall for a handsome young man or some variation on that theme. These days though the odds are good that you will instead find yourself watching a race. There was ""Cars"" in 2006 followed by ""Cars 2"" in 2011. Last years engaging hit ""Wreck-It Ralph"" built to a big race too. And just last month ""Turbo"" brought us a speedy snail.Now comes ""Disneys Planes"" in which a determined little airplane named Dusty Crophopper (the voice of Dane Cook) seeks to escape his workaday life of spraying fertilizer on farm fields and enter an around-the-world race intended for much sleeker and more powerful aircraft. Repeated exposure to racing plotlines rather than drippy romantic ones will almost certainly warp the current generation of toddlers although precisely how wont become clear for a few decades. Romance however has not been banished completely. ""Planes"" carries the clear suggestion that airplanes have sex.More on that later.""Planes"" is in the ""Cars"" lineage with John Lasseters DNA (he is executive producer) and an absence of human characters; the planes and other machines here do their own talking and thinking. What comes out of them isnt as amusing or surprising as what came out of those cars and no matter how fast they go these planes cannot escape the gravitational pull of the earlier movies. ""Planes"" is for the most part content to imitate rather than innovate presumably hoping to reap a respectable fraction of the box office numbers of ""Cars"" and ""Cars 2"" which together made hundreds of millions of dollars (not to mention the ubiquitous product tie-ins).It shamelessly adopts the international story approach of ""Cars 2"" which played well in overseas markets. The airplane racers come from an assortment of countries and stop all over the globe. (The best gag is a reincarnation joke delivered somewhere around India.) And it has the familiar assortment of friends and foes either helping or hindering the likable hero an old aircraft with wise advice a cutthroat one that doesnt play by the rules and so on.Skipper (Stacy Keach) is the old warplane who coaches Dusty and has his own story a nod to the heroics and traumas of the World War II generation. Chug the fuel truck (Brad Garrett) and Dottie the forklift (Teri Hatcher) provide crucial support as well Dottie serving as mechanic. Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith) has won the race three times in a row and will stop at nothing to make it four. Advertisement Continue reading the main story To its credit just when it seems on its way to a predictable happy ending the movie directed by Klay Hall takes a jarringly dark turn as Dusty encounters a frightening storm at sea. Hes flying close to the water because hes afraid of heights not a good thing when the ocean is churning with ""Perfect Storm""-size waves.As for the racy element of this race most of it involves a Mexican plane named El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui). The character is one of several in this movie that carry a whiff of ethnic stereotyping but more notable is this planes relentless wooing of a Canadian plane named Rochelle (Julia Louis-Dreyfus).She eventually succumbs to his charms but what precisely this means is left unclear as their plane-to-plane make-out session takes place off screen. With children being naturally curious parents should prepare themselves by studying the schematics for assorted aircraft. There are bound to be some awkward questions about the birds and the bees and the flying machines.""Disneys Planes"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mildly suggestive moments and a scary encounter with the sea.

"Review Planes stays grounded while it might have soared - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Planes stays grounded while it might have soared Planes Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Planes starring Dane Cook Stacy Keach Brad Garrett Carlos Alazraqui. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews Planes starring Dane Cook Stacy Keach Brad Garrett Carlos Alazraqui. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Planes"" the new animated action adventure from Disney is a jaunty excursion into the wild blue yonder where planes do the talking as well as the flying and a crop-dusting underdog dreams of making the Wings Around the Globe racing circuit.If all that sounds as if its from another era thats because the film feels like old-school Disney. The good guys are well-grounded and doing a lot of ""by Jiminy"" talking about what it takes to have the right stuff. The bad guys arent so awful. And dreams dont seem impossible. Even the hard-rock soundtrack has a nostalgic beat. Youd know it was from the folks who created ""Cars"" even if the ads didnt scream it. The film looks drawn by the same hand (yes I know computers are involved). The general shape of things is nicely rounded not too many harsh edges. The eyes are expressive; a few look slightly sleepy. The color palette feels stone-washed and dreamy. As with ""Cars"" the world of ""Planes"" feels safe. A little too safe perhaps.VIDEO Upcoming summer films I did wonder what kind of magic it would take to make a plane that spews chemicals over farmland into a hero but between the artistry of the animation and the voice of comic Dane Cook Dusty Crophopper is kind of a cool cat. One of the running jokes is a certain lingering smell....Dustys stuck in a place called Prop Wash Junction surrounded by endless acres of green growing things so lush and lovely that its hard to imagine wanting to leave. But the single-engine prop has his eyes on the prize -- hes determined to win that international race.Directed by Klay Hall and written by Jeffrey M. Howard the plot keeps circling around the idea of how the old ways and the new ways can coexist rather than collide. Its only one of ""Planes"" many feel-good messages at times laid on about as thickly as that crop dust.Meanwhile our hero is an unlikely one. Dustys not especially sleek like his nemesis Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith). A sprayer on his belly weighs him down. His engine needs fine-tuning. And he has a serious fear of heights. Anything above 1000 feet and hes in a stomach-churning nose dive. But given flyboy edge by Cook Dusty is the one who propels the action. PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesThe film opens with Dusty dreaming while he and Leadbottom (Cedric the Entertainer) spray and debate the virtues of leaving home versus staying. Dottie (Teri Hatcher) and Chug (Brad Garrett) own the local service station and do their part to keep Dusty in working order. Just as Lightening had an assist from a legendary race car driver in ""Cars"" famously voiced by Paul Newman Dusty has Skipper (Stacy Keach). Hes a local recluse and a former fighter pilot whom Dusty enlists to train him. You can tell the filmmakers love planes and flight there are lots of specifics -- it can be a little much.When the tiny prop plane finally makes racings big leagues the film starts to pick up speed.The race is the place where most of the movies conflicts play out and many of the characters come on board. In line with the action movie trend of pan-Asian romance Dusty falls for Ishani (Priyanka Chopra). John Cleese as Bulldog provides the British stiff upper lip and a latte snap. The international influences seem calibrated to enhance overseas box office potential. There is not a villain among them unless you count El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui) the movies scene stealer.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 I dont know what it is about animation per se but it seems to unleash the inner Don Juan in actors and animators alike. ""Shrek"" had its irresistible Puss in Boots brought to marvelous life by Antonio Banderas. Alazraqui does the same for ""Planes"" with El Chu. Though his passion for Rochelle (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) a slick pink Canadian number from Quebec with the accent to match is unrequited his wooing is relentless. It is the film at its most charming.And now a moment of silence. For the sound.It plays a distinctive role in ""Planes"" so a shout-out to the multitudes involved. Sound is always a key element in every film but the way in which the filmmakers manipulate it in ""Planes"" is especially inventive. The silence when it comes is so surprising and so complete that its a grabber.For a movie about planes a lot happens on the ground -- those refueling stops can take forever. But the animators take advantage of the power of flight packing the action sequences with daredevil runs. But its a race and a kind of sameness occasionally sets in. The slingshot launches off an aircraft carrier that comes to Dustys aid provide a needed injection of adrenaline.Ripslinger doesnt always play on the up and up. And after more than a few ups and downs Dusty finds out who his real friends are -- and more important -- what hes made of. The film struggles with the same issues. If it had been made of stronger stuff more like Dusty ""Planes"" might have soared.betsy.sharkeylatimes.comPlanesMPAA rating PG for some mild action and rude humorRunning time 1 hour 32 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Animation (Movie Genre) Entertainment Movies Planes (movie) Teri Hatcher Antonio Banderas PG Rated Movies On the Set Movies and TV Review Despite Matt Damon Elysium disappoints Review Lovelace reveals degradation of porn stars life Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-planes-movie-review-20130809,0,3115648.story",200,planes5,planes,latimes

Its engaging enough driving home the familiar message of following ones dreams and the less hackneyed theme of facing ones fears. But it feels far too familiarNot only are the plot and cast of characters of this 3-D animated adventure strongly reminiscent of Pixars Cars but there is overlap between Cars creator John Lasseter and the DisneyToon Studios filmmakers responsible for Planes.Lasseter the chief creative officer for Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios worked closely with director Klay Hall on the story and is credited as executive producer. So with his imprimatur its easy for audiences to wrongly assume this is a Pixar creation. Its certainly on a related creative plane.SNEAK PEEK Look Up in the sky Its an exclusive peek at PlanesREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersWouldnt it have been better if Pixar had created a transportation trilogy from the get-go? Why not have a kid-friendly take on Planes Trains amp; Automobiles?Instead this feels like a reheated stew with capable voice talent slick animation and too many locomotion puns. It also feels like a merchandising bonanza.Dusty Crophopper is a low-flying crop-duster on Midwestern farmland who dreams of being a racer. He doesnt want to be defined by his less-than-imposing size and yearns to pursue his big dreams. Sound familiar? A similar theme has coursed through Cars Ratatouille Lilo amp; Stitch A Bugs Life and more recently Turbo.There are virtually no impediments to Dusty achieving success save his own fear of heights. He qualifies for a worldwide race with minimum preparation so off he goes into the wild blue yonder.Dane Cook lends Dusty a peppy voice but the more memorable voices have foreign accents. Regarded cynically their international flavor is a fairly obvious bid to reach a global market. Still at least theyre distinctly diverse.El Chupacabra is humorously voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. Not only is this plane a legendary star of Mexican telenovelas but hes also warmhearted and charismatic. And his serenading rendition of The Miracles Love Machine is sung with surprising soul. As interpreted by Julia Louis-Dreyfus French-Canadian plane Rochelle is competitive and clear-eyed. John Cleese lends his distinctive British tones to Bulldog a veteran plane whos been racing longer than anyone on the circuit. Ishani the colorful and sassy Pan-Asian champ is charmingly brought to life by Indian superstar Priyanka Chopra.The planes race from New York to Iceland and Germany then across the Himalayas to China and over the Pacific Ocean to Mexico. The opportunity for iconic imagery looms at every checkpoint. And the message about stepping out of ones comfort zone may be worthier of passing on to kids than the overdone one about striving.Its just too bad that the movie didnt take its own advice and step out of the formulaic animation transportation zone. 21 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1ev1gztSummer Movies Calendar AugustTake a look at the films heading to the box office this August complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

""From the world of Cars comes Disneys Planes"" say the commercials and for once theres truth in advertising. ""Planes"" is just a zippy little programmer designed to exploit the same vehicles-as-people formula as the ""Cars"" franchise. The great old studios too used to spin low-budget variations on their own and each others hits. ""Planes"" has roughly the same relationship to ""Cars"" as ""Congo Maisie"" had to ""Red Dust.""The plot has been super-simplified. Instead of a racing hotshot who learns small-town values and how to drive for the right reasons our hero in ""Planes"" is already a rural crop-duster who values his down-to-earth friends. He dreams of (sound trumpets for the moral) ""doing more than just what I was built for."" He wants to compete in the ""Wings Around the Globe"" aviation rally. His name is Dusty Crophopper since inventive nomenclature popped to 5 a gallon during the writing of the screenplay.Dane Cook is surprisingly amiable in this go-getter role which begins with Dusty lost in ""Top Gun"" fantasies (Anthony Edwards and Val Kilmer give vocal cameos) then swiftly moves into gear as his clattery fuel-truck pal Chug (Brad Garrett) and can-do mechanic Dottie (Teri Hatcher) ready him for the rallys qualifying race. He performs well enough to snag the attention of a Second World War fighter plane named Skipper (Stacy Keach) who functions as a cross between a D.I. in a basic-training film and Paul Newmans wise ""Doc"" in ""Cars.""Before long Dusty is racing across the continents with an international crew of jolly cartoonish stereotypes like Bulldog (John Cleese) the stiff-upper-lip Englishman who blubbers when struck by emotion and El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui) the flamboyant Mexican star of racing telenovelas and romance novels who wears his heart on his wing and becomes Dustys closest ""compadre.""The movie has its share of visual wit El Chupacabra dons a cape and mask and roughly has the same profile as Jack Black in ""Nacho Libre."" And writer Jeffrey M. Howard fills the script with racing lore that gives this sleek confection some welcome knotty verbal textures - lets hope they entice some kids to learn what ""a radial G pass"" really is.But apart from the fleeting charms of Dustys friendships and one dazzling lyric interlude - a flight over India with the alluring but ambiguous Ishani (Priyanka Chopra) - the movie fails to spark much emotion beyond a general ""go for it"" spirit. Even the moments of high merriment and high drama feel well mechanical. For the record I preferred El Chupacabra serenading his French-Canadian sweetie Rochelle (Julia-Louis Drefyus) to Skipper revealing the dark secret of why he stopped flying after World War II.Still the overall attitude is chipper and the flying scenes are exciting (if not exactly memorable) in the post-""Star Wars"" lets-steer-this-baby-between-two-walls kind of way. (And why not? John Lasseter who executive-produced the film and co-wrote the story really got his start at LucasFilm.)My biggest fear is that this films success will mean a string of uninspired entries. Whats next? ""From the world of Cars and Planes comes Trains"" - except given the state of American high-speed rail it would have to be set entirely in Europe and Japan.Contact the writer msragowocregister.com Most Popular Costa Mesa Police detail homeowners 2012 fatal shooting of burglar -- caper involved artDodgers Yasiel Puig remains in limbo as trade deadline nears; Jay Bruce a possible targeTim Lincecums struggles continue in Angels 6-2 loss to Red SoxGrocery Outlet debut Free Bruxie lunch for shoppers next week in OrangeEarly Trump supporter changes her tune User Agreement Comments are encouraged but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy amp; Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

"Planes a sky-high crowd pleaser for kids review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPlanes a sky-high crowd pleaser for kids reviewPlanes the latest animated offering from Disney doesnt quite soar. But strong visuals and an engaging story will likely appeal to young audiences.Dusty the hero of Planes basks in the approval of adoring fans.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Aug. 8 2013PlanesStarring the voices of Dane Cook Stacey Keach. Directed by Klay Hall. 92 minutes. Opens Aug 9 at major theatres. GHe may be a lowly crop duster but he has a soaring ambition to win an around-the-world race. Now if only Dusty Crophopper could overcome his fear of heights.Article Continued BelowThats the premise behind Planes the latest feature out of DisneyToon Studios a film clearly inspired by the anthropomorphic success of another Disney product Pixar Studios Cars and Cars 2 which together grossed more than 1 billion at the box office. ""Ive flown 1000s of miles and Ive never been anywhere"" Dusty (voiced by comic Dane Cook) laments. But even after narrowly qualifying for the Wings Around the World event -- after another competitor cheats and is disqualified -- Dusty gets little respect from his fellow competitors who disdain him as a ""farm boy"" who reeks of um compost.Planes follows the standard Disney formula to the letter the mean-spirited alpha male villain named Ripslinger (voiced by Roger Craig Smith) who along with two nasty minions Ned and Zed will do anything to win against the underdog hero Dusty who manages to prevail through sheer pluck and with the help of friends old and new.While the film is clearly aimed at young audiences theres also an effort to bring along adults with a script that contains several humorous references that would be way over the heads of youngsters.To wit naming a colour commentator Brent Mustangburger a reference to sports personality Brent Musburger giving the control tower at New Yorks JFK Airport a Kennedy-esque accent and a conversation between two female planes about an eligible but undesirable male flyer -- ""Nice enough guy but way too much baggage.""Director Klay Hall has also corralled a slew of celebrity voices among them British comic John Cleese as Bulldog a de Havilland Comet; Stacey Keach as the gruff Skipper Riley an aged Corsair who trains Dusty and Julia Louis-Dreyfus doing a howlingly bad Quebecois accent as his love interest Rochelle. And while the plotting is rather pedestrian the humour mostly lame what makes Planes a stand-out experience -- not surprisingly based on Disneys vast and impressive history of animated classics -- is the visuals.With so much of the action taking place in the stratosphere the film is a visual treat throughout including scenes of simple homespun beauty such as Nebraska cornfields and others of breathtaking magnificence capturing the majesty of the Himalayas and the Pacific Ocean during a raging storm. If ever a film was designed to take advantage of 3-D it is this one and it does.With a sequel already in production and set for release in 2014 the people at Disney clearly have sky-high expectations of Planes. Their confidence will likely be rewarded.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Everett Collection Often less really is more and thats why I can recommend ""Planes a charmingly modest low-budget spin-off from Pixars ""Cars that provides more thrills and laughs for young children and their parents than many of its more elaborate brethren. With so little money at stake director Klay Hall writer Jeffrey Howard and the rest of the team are free to have some fun -- and even make fun of the sort of ethnic stereotypes largely banished in Disneys more politically correct theatrical product. And they dont feel the obligations to force-feed young audiences heavy-handed life lessons in every other scene. The story -- somewhat similar to DreamWorks recent ""Turbo -- is simplicity itself. Dusty a lowly sentient cropduster (voiced by Dane Cook) wants to live out his dream of entering an around-the-world flying competition never mind that hes afraid of heights. Encouraged in his unlikely ambitions by a perky forklift (Teri Hatcher) and a dimwitted fuel truck (Brad Garrett) Dusty is reluctantly coached by a crusty Navy Corsair from World War II (Stacy Keach). Qualifying through a fluke Dusty arrives for the start of the race at Kennedy Airport. The only competitors who pay much attention to him are Mexicos El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui) and Britains Bulldog (John Cleese). Romantic interest is provided by the French-Canadian plane Rochelle (Julia-Louis Dreyfuss) and the Indian entrant Ishani (Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra). The bad guy is the egotistical defending champion Ripslinger (voiced by Roger Craig Smith) who is constantly trying to sabotage the plucky and resourceful Dusty. RELATED DELVE INTO WHATS NEW IN THIS SEASONS ANIMATED MOVIES The flying footage is extremely well executed for a low-budget animated feature but never sacrifices character in favor of action like Pixars ""Cars 2 did. In fact ""Planes is vastly better than the noisy and crass ""Cars 2 and even a bit superior to the once-great Pixars latest the pricey but ponderous ""Monsters University. Not a Pixar product ""Planes was made for a fraction of the cost by DisneyToon Studios and was headed straight for DVD -- until the Mouse House decided it could be profitably cycled through theaters with a 3-D makeover. (Do yourself a favor and skip the stereoscopic surcharge which is not worth it.) ""Planes is fairly predictable and is far from a masterpiece. But it runs around an hour and a quarter before the closing credits. Thats a definite plus in an era when bloated cartoons frequently exceed the attention span of younger audience members.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A little crop duster dreams of entering an around-the-world race. Rated PG (some rude humor) BOTTOM LINE A dreary point-for-point ""Cars"" imitation. Even last months middling ""Turbo"" beats this by a mile. CAST Dane Cook Stacy Keach Teri Hatcher Priyanka Chopra DIRECTOR 132 From under the hood of Disneys ""Planes"" you can hear the worrisome sound of knocking and pinging. An opening logo places us in the ""World of Cars"" as in the Pixar film and that studios chief idea guy John Lasseter is this films executive producer and story writer. But ""Planes"" is not a Pixar movie. It was originally intended as a home-video release from Disneytoon Studios known mostly for nontheatrical follow-ups like ""The Little Mermaid II Return to the Sea."" All of which helps explain why this big-screen production feels like a small-screen knock-off though younger viewers wont care. If ""Planes"" were a reasonably priced download youd gladly use it to sedate your kids during a long car ride. As a theatrical 3-D release however ""Planes"" will sedate you too. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Everything about ""Planes"" is pure boilerplate beginning with its story. Dusty (the voice of Dane Cook) is a little crop duster who dreams of competing in an around-the-world race. His friends include the dopey fuel truck Chug (Brad Garrett) and forklift mechanic Dottie (Teri Hatcher) but its the grizzled World War II vet Skipper (Stacy Keach) who helps Dusty conquer his fear of heights. In the race Dusty will compete against various international stereotypes including the U.K.s crusty Bulldog (John Cleese) and Mexicos hotblooded El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui). Racing champ Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith) is the villain -- arrogant underhanded etc. Though capably directed by Klay Hall ""Planes"" cant rise above the low-aiming script by Jeffrey M. Howard (both are Disneytoon veterans). The constant nods to ""Cars"" may help with brand recognition but they also make the movie feel stale. Everything is overly familiar from the characters distinctive windshield eyes to the borrowed jokes about tractor cows. Broadening the movies horizons just slightly is an Indian plane Ishani (Priyanka Chopra) who develops an East-West romance with Dusty. ""Planes"" is running so low on creative fuel that adult viewers may become distracted by weird details. For instance In this all-mechanical world populated entirely by talking vehicles jets and ships who the heck is eating Dustys crops? Your children however probably wont ask the tough questions. 125 MoviesDisneys Planes trailer PLOT A little crop duster dreams of entering an around-the-world race. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (some rude humor) CAST Dane Cook Stacy Keach Teri Hatcher Priyanka Chopra LENGTH 132 BOTTOM LINE A dreary point-for-point ""Cars"" imitation.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Dusty is a small crop duster with big dreams in ""Planes"" a new DisneyToon Studios production with an unoriginal but unobjectionable plot. (Disney) By Jen Chaney August 8 2013 Follow chaneyj ""Planes"" is the story of a plucky crop duster (voice of Dane Cook) who desperately wants to compete in an international air race and prove that hes capable of achieving great speed. That sounds a lot like ""Turbo"" the DreamWorks Animation feature released last month about a snail (voice of Ryan Reynolds) who desperately wants to compete in the Indy 500 and prove that hes capable of achieving great speed. And ""Turbo"" was a tad derivative of ""Cars"" the 2006 Pixar hit about a racecar (voice of Owen Wilson) desperate to win the Piston Cup and prove that hes fast enough to earn a splashy new sponsor. Which brings us back to ""Planes"" a perfectly pleasant and perfectly bland DisneyToon Studios production thats actually a spinoff of ""Cars"" and its sequel ""Cars 2."" Is this what now qualifies as the circle of life in contemporary family-friendly animation? Will every feature-length cartoon starring anthropomorphized slugs and single-engine prop planes blatantly borrow from one another over and over again until the movies we take our kids to see transform into a tangled rubber-band ball of pseudo-inspirational sameness thats too much of a hassle to pull apart because we just want to keep the little monsters quiet for 92 minutes? It sort of feels like thats whats happening. ""Planes"" is okay. Its message about pursuing big dreams -- the only kind of dreams by the way that a crop duster with people eyes can have -- is uninspired but unobjectionable. It also features some genuinely exhilarating scenes in which the camera twists and barrel-rolls with Dusty (thats the crop duster) as he zips across the sky. Still this largely tedious story makes it impossible to forget what ""Planes"" actually is a straight-to-DVD DisneyToons movie thats been gussied up in Pixar-esque clothes for a pre-back-to-school theatrical release designed to sell expensive 3-D tickets and send the kiddos straight to Target to buy ""Planes""-inspired toys and merchandise. John Lasseter -- the chief creative officer for Pixar and Walt Disney Animation as well as the director of such Pixar favorites as ""Toy Story"" and ""Cars"" -- serves as executive producer here. But as the film unfolds one can practically hear the sounds of Pixar employees whispering ""Pssst I didnt do it."" Even the youngest moviegoers could probably outline the plot points in ""Planes"" before stepping into the multiplex. First we meet Dusty a determined cornfield sprayer eager to defy the odds and compete in the Wings Around the Globe race which takes truly fierce propeller-spinners on a challenging course through Iceland the Himalayas and Mexico. Then we meet crusty Skipper (voice of Stacy Keach) a veteran Navy fighter plane who becomes Dustys coach and is a blatantly obvious retread of Doc Hudson from ""Cars."" Then we watch the race unfold forcing Dusty to dig deep into his determination reserves in an attempt to triumph over a condescending rival (Ripslinger not unlike Guy Gagne from ""Turbo""). Then theres a huge midair collision and everyone dies. Ha ha no That doesnt happen Of course you know whats really going to happen because this film is 100 percent devoid of surprises. Its the story of an underestimated underdog thats like every other kid-friendly life-coachy story about an underestimated underdog. Dusty says he just wants to prove that ""maybe I can do more than I was built for."" Unfortunately ""Planes"" doesnt strive to achieve that same lofty goal. It does exactly what it was built for and absolutely nothing more. Chaney is a freelance writer. 1/2 PG. At area theaters.

More about Planes >> The animated film has all the hallmarks of a straight-to-DVD project - inferior plot dull writing cheap drawing - perhaps because it was intended for the bargain bin at Target Walmart and Costco. But for reasons that can only be mercenary Disney has upgraded the film to major theatrical release tacking on extraneous 3D effects. Dusty is a lowly single-prop mulch-pungent crop duster with big dreams. Faster than you can say Sully Sullenberger - in other words with precious little preface or justification - hes competing against a top-flight fleet of planes in a prestigious round-the-world race. ""You gotta be kidding me"" one of the events sleek participants says on seeing Dusty. ""That farmers going to race?"" If the aircraft look familiar - with their vaguely anthropormorphic windshield eyes and front-grill mouths and comfortingly 50s design - its because Planes is a spinoff of the Pixar franchise Cars. A weak spinoff apparently intended for a very young audience because the forklifts fuel trucks and other supporting vehicles look like Playskool toys. The toddlerish tone clashes with the reliance on technical terms (""hes pulling an aggressive 9.2 Gs"") in the script. Comedian Dane Cook voices Dusty (replacing Jon Cryer who pulled out of the project). Hes joined by a chorus of voices including Stacy Keach Brad Garrett and Teri Hatcher. Pitching in in smaller roles are Val Kilmer Sinbad Anthony Edwards John Cleese and Brent Musburger (huh?). The distressing part about Planes is that the films attempts at humor are entirely derived from ethnic typecasting. Theres a Mexican plane a British one Indian French-Canadian German etc. They all have thick accents layered on top of sterotyped behaviors. Why are foreign people so funny Mommy? Want proof that Planes is an obvious and rather dreary marketing tool? Before the film was released two sequels were already in the works. But the only reason to pay cineplex prices for this tripe is if youre absolutely desperate to keep the kids occupied for a few hours.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com PLANES Share Comment The relative decline of the quality of Pixars animated features has at least one benefit its presumed effect on corporate sibling rivalry. Disney animated features dont have as much catching up to do. ""Planes"" Disneys latest seems in fact like a lesser version of what may be Pixars two weakest efforts the ""Cars"" movies. That likeness may have something to do with the fact that Disney animation chief John Lasseter who directed and cowrite the Pixar titles is executive producer and cowriter of ""Planes."" Like ""Cars"" ""Planes"" features vehicles with faces and personalities -- mostly aircraft of course but also trucks and forklifts and yes cars. Propellers make for nice nose substitutes. Chief among the personalities is Dusty (voiced by Dane Cook) a single-engine crop-duster. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

Perhaps its because the first Cars was for many of us the first indication that the geniuses at Pixar for all their artistic accomplishments were also part of a money-making enterprise; they seemed perfectly content creating a movie that merely entertained millions of kids and sold merchandise by the metric ton. (That said the less said about Cars 2A -- which even my 4-year-old refuses to watchA -- the better.) Planes was produced not by Pixar but by the folks at DisneyToon Studios the folks who for years have been gamely churning out direct-to-video sequels of classic Disney films like Bambi II and Cinderella II Dreams Come True. So as soon as you see the ""World of Cars"" logo at the beginning you can practically smell the corporate synergy. Ironically enough the plot of Planes feels less like Cars and more like the recent Turbo. This time instead of a snail that participates in the Indy 500 weve got a crop-duster that participates in a renowned round-the-world circuit race. For help in this endeavor our hero Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook) enlists a ragtag ground crew including a feisty forklift voiced by Teri Hatcher and a gently growly fuel truck voiced by Brad Garrett. Of course theres also a surly veteran who is initially resistant to helping our hero but gradually comes around WWII fighter jet Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach) who can no longer fly due to his traumatic wartime experiences as part of a squad named the Jolly Wrenches. Dusty is ambitious and hes a good flyer but hes alsoA -- get thisA -- afraid of heights. His hope is to win the race by staying relatively close to the ground. Can he do it? And will he be able to defeat the high-tech showboating longtime champion Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith)? Take one wild guess. Kids will probably enjoy Planes because well its called Planes and its got lots of planes and it doesnt beat around the bush getting to the planes doing their plane thing flying and banking and swooping. And the international nature of the race allows for some decent variation in locales along the way. One appealing brief sequence in the Himalayas has Dusty flying through a tunnel in an attempt to stay close to the ground running into a train and winding up in a Buddhist monastery. Another scene involves a nod to the famous romantic plane ride from Out of Africa and this time the elegant flocks of flamingos taking flight are themselves tiny little baby planes. Anyway planes. Planes planes planes. Aesthetically the problem with Planes (and to some extent with the Cars films) is that vehicles being inorganic limit the visual range of the film in terms of both design and movement. Eventually a world full of planes just gets boring no matter how many times they soar and spin and swoosh. After a while it feels about as interesting as a movie called Phones in which everybodys a phone. Or Boxes. Or Light Bulbs. When later on Dusty gets stuck in a cyclone in the middle of the Pacific you can feel your eyes getting excited at the sight of wavesA -- gloriously un-angular and undulating and unpredictable. (Id happily watch a movie called Waves.) But on just about every other level other than visuals Planes is dry dry dry. Theres no verbal wit no standout vocal performances. (We dont expect much from Dane Cook but some of the other actors like Keach and John Cleese who voices a British contender in the race have potential.) The film was reportedly developed to be another straight-to-video toon until the honchos at Disney liked the footage so much that they decided to turn it into a theatrical feature. That doesnt always bode ill The remarkable Toy Story 2 also started out the same way. But in going from the small screen to the big Planes doesnt appear to have gotten the requisite injection of wit imagination or energy. Its not terrible but it still feels like a waste.

"Planes 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Planes 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Planes Bad 2 stars Director Klay Hall. Cast Dane Cook Stacy Keach Brad Garrett. Rating PG for some mild action and rude humor. By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Aug 21 2013 1142 AM If youve watched the trailers you might go into ""Planes"" thinking its an awful lot like ""Cars"" and it is a sequel to one of Pixars least-regarded films.But dont worry. Its an awful lot like ""Turbo"" instead.Thats not a compliment.Rather than a snail trying to race in the Indy 500 ""Planes"" directed by Klay Hall is the story of a crop duster trying to compete in an international aviation race. Can the underdog overcome the odds his own fears and doubts and a crowd favorite who is a bad guy in disguise?If you saw ""Turbo"" you know the answer to that question. Actually if youve even seen any movie with underdogs in it you know the answer to that question. Which is fine. Predictability alone doesnt sink a movie.But combine it with a lazy script some oddly broad stereotypes and a competition not a whole lot of people know or care about and youve got... um ""Cars 2"" in the sky maybe?Thats not a compliment either.The small children at whom ""Planes"" is so obviously aimed probably wont mind that because all the toys and lunchboxes and whatnot will look just as nifty no matter how good or bad the movie is. The dispiriting thing is that you cant shake the feeling the folks at Disney the studio that made the movie were thinking the same thing.Dusty (voice of Dane Cook) is the crop duster who spends his days spraying fields but dreaming of racing. Hes supported in this by his pal Chug (Brad Garrett) a truck who is kind of like a slightly smarter Mater from the ""Cars"" movies and Dottie (Teri Hatcher) Dustys mechanic. (Not human; there are no people in the film. Shes like a little tractor or something.)In addition to not being the sleekest plane in the sky Dusty has one other problem Hes afraid of heights. (Its a problem more talked about than displayed.)With coaching from Skipper (Stacy Keach) a legendary World War II fighter Dusty manages to make it into the race. There he meets his competitors including El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui) from Mexico; Bulldog (John Cleese) from England; and Ishani (Priyanka Chopra) from India. Imagine those nationalities depicted with all the subtlety and sensitivity of a 1950s comic book and youll have a good idea of how theyre presented.For Dusty however the big trouble is Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith) the defending champion whose talent is matched only by his ego. Hes not buying into this underdog business. He wants to crush Dusty and everyone else in the race.The competition provides several opportunities for mayhem and mischief and for the planes to get to know each other better. There are not a lot of surprises with the exception of a segment involving Skipper that includes some remarkably grown-up elements which is odd in a movie made for tykes.""Planes"" was originally scheduled to be released straight to video. Although the smallest children might like bits and pieces of it theres nothing in the movie that suggests why Disney strayed from its original plan. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

Dusty voiced by comedian Dane Cook is a plucky crop duster who... Planes Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Dane Cook Stacy Keach and Teri Hatcher. Directed by Klay Hall. (PG. 92 minutes.) ""I am more than just a crop duster"" Dusty Crop-hopper exclaims at the beginning of ""Planes"" and its hard not to sigh. In recent years weve seen a penguin who wants to dance a video game villain who wants to be a good guy and most recently a snail who wants to be a race car. The children of the world get it. You can be whatever you want if you work really hard and have a couple of charming sidekicks. But after a trying first act this DisneyToon Studios release finds a nice cruising altitude embarking on a world tour that yields some pleasant surprises. ""Planes"" was supposed to debut direct-to-video before Disney decided it was deserving of the big screen. (Story idea A video store cassette that dreams of being a theatrical release) ""Planes"" is no ""Toy Story 2"" but it was certainly worthy of the promotion. Dusty (voiced by Dane Cook) is a small-town crop duster who finds a mentor in a relic war plane named Skipper (Stacy Keach) and yearns to compete in a grand prix-style race around the world. If that sounds like ""Cars"" and ""Cars 2"" - the movie poster tagline also references the connection - know that this film efforts to distance itself from its Pixar distant cousins. Theres no Lightning McQueen. No Radiator Springs. Even John Ratzenberger gets to voice a completely new character. Looking at the history of spin-offs as related to their source material ""Planes"" feels less like ""The Penguins of Madagascar"" and more like ""Prometheus."" The sidekicks training sequences and mentor-trainee growing pains in ""Planes"" have a familiar feel. The first 30 minutes sometimes seem like more of a checklist than a movie. However once Dusty earns his wings screenwriter Jeffrey M. Howard and the story team seem to get more adventurous as well. Much fun is had with the destinations whether its a temple in India or an aircraft carrier. Dustys suave Latin friend El Chupacabra has an excellent serenading scene which starts with a ""Say Anything"" reference before turning into something original and sweet. The main story arc remains predictable with several themes - including Dustys fear of heights and Skippers mysterious military background - reaching inevitable conclusions. But the smaller details remain fresh. When Dusty gets to New York the JFK Airport air traffic controllers have Kennedy-esque accents and the Statue of Liberty appears to be a forklift. (Three films into this sort-of series its time to ask what has happened to all the humans in these movies. Was there some kind of ""Maximum Overdrive""-style takeover or does the fact that no enslaved humans remain mean that humankind never existed at all? In any case adults shouldnt do drugs and watch ""Cars"" or ""Planes."") Airplane buffs are going to have a particularly good time; each of the planes seems to have an obscure real-life counterpart. And pop-culture junkies will appreciate a few sly nods as well. Listen very carefully to the voices of Bravo and Echo the two F-18 Hornets that Dusty meets in the middle of the film. The biggest enemy of ""Planes"" may be misinformation. Many moviegoers are going to enter theaters thinking this is a Pixar film with the raised expectations that accompany that mistake. But even cynical animation fans will see theres quality here. After a little turbulence ""Planes"" comes in for a nice landing. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

""Planes"" may be going straight to video but we like to feel good about where things are going even if this isnt a Pixar project the way ""Cars"" and ""Cars 2"" were. Those were some toys right? How many billions? Too many for me to count. My son cant get enough of Lightning McQueen. Heres a photo.Lights instantly dim and the executive runs through an elegant slide show of his son in the bath playing with cars from ""Cars.""The executive This summer you know what I want?

And in the Doc role the one Paul Newman voiced in the first ""Cars"" we have Stacy Keach as Skipper the crusty mentor with the dramatic World War II back story the one that seems to come from an entirely different picture.The executive I liked those storyboards. Real History Channel stuff.Howard Because John (Lasseter the Disney/Pixar giant who executive-produced ""Planes"" and helped cook up the story) is a nostalgic fellow were going for some of that stuff from his moviegoing youth. You know ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines."" ""The Great Race."" That sort of thing.The executive losing interest checking his iPad Right.Hall But with heart.The executive Very important. What is it that Walt said? For every laugh a tear?

BY Jordan Hoffman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday August 8 2013 1200 PM Title Planes Film Info PG Rude humor. Area theaters. In 3-D where available. If ""Cars"" was first class the semi-sequel ""Planes"" is definitely coach. A Disney release -- but not a Pixar production it should be noted -- ""Planes"" is set in the same sort of world as the 2006 ""Cars"" and its 2011 followup. Vehicles are sentient and no humans exist (but there are still buildings and houses for some reason). This movie was originally intended as a direct-to-video release but when you can airlift this much money duty-free why not book a theatrical reservation too? Dane Cook is the voice of Dusty a crop-duster with dreams of being a celebrated racing plane. With the coaching of World War II-era bomber-type Skipper (Stacy Keach) and his best bud a fuel truck named Chug (Brad Garrett) Dusty enters a round-the-world race to prove hes got the right stuff. Dustys big secret though is that hes a plane with a fear of heights. (As a crop-duster he can stay low.) But with a new international group of high-flyin friends like Bulldog (John Cleese) -- a Union Jack-decorated stiff-upper-propeller British plane -- and a potential love interest in the Indian jet-setter Ishani (Priyanka Chopra) no turbulence will get in the way. The jokes in ""Planes"" are runway flat and parents will likely reach for the air-sickness bag. Alas in this entry theres no character as remotely endearing as Mater Larry the Cable Guys ""Cars"" staple. Some sequences here have a bit of visual dazzle but plenty of them look like they were done on the cheap (theres a lot of time spent just hangin round the hangar.) Little ones will stay engaged but any kid old enough to fly unaccompanied will probably search for other in-flight entertainment.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Taking a flawed property and removing all redeeming facets like a chop-shop mechanic stripping an old vehicle of its working parts Planes demonstrates that even Pixars creative nadir is hard to match. For many the fact that this Mouse House spin-off exists within the ""world of Cars""--as an opening title card unnecessarily announces--is reason enough to steer clear. John Lasseters twin odes to the automobile take a lot of abuse; critics have held them up as proof not only that Pixar is fallible but that its artistic engines have become increasingly fueled by purely monetary concerns. Pandering as they are though Cars and its 007-flavored sequel are plainly labors of love--not just for professed car nut Lasseter but also for the actors and animators bringing those anthropomorphized machines to life. The same most certainly cannot be said for Planes in which Disney proper offers its soulless approximation of a Pixar movie. Its the cinematic equivalent of those Chinese knockoff luxury sedans. The hook here is that unlike its earthbound predecessors Planes occasionally soars into the vast open expanses of the sky. The best that can be said for the movie is that some of its airborne imagery is pretty though shouldnt visual delights be a given for a Disney-animated offering? Doing his best Owen Wilson impersonation Dane Cook voices Dusty a plucky crop duster who yearns--like the super-powered mollusk of last months Turbo--to go fast. Trouble is not only was he not built for speed he has a crippling fear of heights. Like most family films this one seems determined to tell its impressionable young audience that no dream is too impossible so soon enough Dusty is overcoming his limitations to compete in a globe-crossing race. In his corner are a Mater-like fuel truck (Brad Garrett) and a veteran fighter plane (Stacy Keach) clearly modeled on Paul Newmans rusty mentor figure in Cars. Theres also a whole fleet of supporting stereotypes er characters--most of whom are voiced by paycheck-cashing celebrities contributing little but an opportunity to sell a few more tie-in toys. Clearly set to autopilot Planes races through obligatory plot points rushing its zero-to-hero narrative. The pokiness of Cars which was a full half-hour longer than this speedy cash-grab looks in retrospective like a benefit There was time back in Radiator Springs for such niceties as character development. Planes cuts corners at every turn a strategy that leaves it feeling like the skeletal framework of an incomplete Pixar project. Then again when the films idea of charm is having one of its many comic-relief aircrafts perform a slow mariachi-band rendition of ""Love Machine"" maybe getting to the finish line as quickly as possible isnt such a bad thing. For captive parents the lone source of interest may be trying to make sense of the eternally confusing Cars universe--a place where Old Yeller apparently exists but dogs dont and vacationing automobiles pack suitcases full of clothing which they dont wear. Come to think of it why would this world even need crop dusters? Do the machines eat? What are their insides made of anyway? Perhaps one of the two already-in-the-works Planes sequels will crack one of these unholy machines open. Thatd be about the only reason to return to this nose-diving franchise.

Daily Edition Login to download Planes Film Review 900 PM PDT 8/6/2013 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Despite the more aerodynamic setting this ""Cars"" 3D offshoot emerges as an uninspired retread. TWITTER It may be an official Cars spinoff but you wont find the name Pixar anywhere in connection with Disneys Planes. While visually engaging this production of Disneytoon Studios -- it was originally slated to go direct-to-DVD -- lacks the sort of character depth and dramatic scope normally associated with the Pixar brand. Granted the Cars vehicles especially the 2011 sequel were never embraced by critics as prime Pixar but that lack of substance never seemed to matter in toy stores where they have been merchandising behemoths. Likewise the main thrust for Planes would appear to be a surefire way to supplement those Lightning McQueen sales. Theatrically given the crowded animated feature marketplace Planes should do solid if unspectacular business -- provided audiences dont mind some overlapping plot and character similarities also shared with the recent Turbo and Despicable Me. PHOTOS 26 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Man of Steel Wolverine The Lone Ranger It should be noted that theres a happy precedent where Disneys Planes is concerned -- both Toy Story 2 and The Tigger Movie also started out life as direct-to-DVD propositions. Set in a patch of the American Midwest that looks remarkably like Radiator Springs from the first Cars movie Planes concerns the competitive high-flying ambitions of one Dusty Crophopper (affably voiced by Dane Cook) a crop duster who feels the need for speed. Taken under the wing of a reclusive mentor Skipper (Stacy Keach) a Navy Corsair who once commanded the celebrated Jolly Wrenches squadron until an incident removed him from combat Dusty also receives coaching by Dottie (Teri Hatcher) a spunky no-nonsense forklift. After a few minor adjustments Dusty finds himself going up against the unbeatable Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith) in a globe-spanning air-racing event that takes him a long way from the heartland. Based on a concept by executive producer John Lasseter and directed by Klay Hall (""King of the Hill"") the well-researched film contains enough technical jargon to please aviation buffs but comes up short on freshness and originality where those characters are concerned. As written by Jeffrey M. Howard (Secret of the Wings) the screenplay settles for the slightest of variations on what has preceded it -- gruff Skipper is simply a winged take on gruff Doc Hudson; Dustys smug green nemesis Ripslinger is a knock-off of McQueens smug green nemesis Chick Hicks; dimwitted fuel truck Chug (voiced by Brad Garrett) recalls dimwitted tow-truck Mater and so on. That element of familiarity at least serves the voice cast well with Top Gun co-stars Anthony Edwards and Val Kilmer lending their voices to the characters of Echo and Bravo while Brent Musburger reprises his Cars 2 role as sportscaster Brent Mustangburger. Also on energetically on board are Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a French-Canadian competitor named Rochelle whos being doggedly courted by overly-confident El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui) something of a luchador of the indoor racing world.

The trend continues with the Mouse Houses latest dissatisfied hero Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook) who fantasizes about doing ""more than I was built for."" Dustys a plane you see--a crop duster whod rather be racing around pylons than spraying rows of corn with fertilizer. He gets his chance after just barely placing in a local competition which guarantees him a spot in a globehopping aerial race. But first this green country boy (who is paradoxically afraid of heights) requires some Rocky-esque tutelage from Skipper (Stacy Keach) a seemingly tough-as-nails Navy Corsair whose gruff demeanor hides his tragic past. A typically colorful narratively inconsequential entry in the Disney canon Planes manages to be slightly more involving than the two installments of Cars (an opening card informs us that all of these sentient machines share the same world). Credit director Klay Hall and his team of animators for maximizing the gravity-defying visuals--an ethereal flight to a Himalayan monastery is especially awe-inspiring--which distract from much of the questionable comedy. Strangest is the films tendency toward racial stereotyping which comes off as breezily silly at best (John Cleeses Bulldog is a snooty British De Havilland Comet) and downright insensitive at worst (Cedric the Entertainer voices a Southern-accented laze-about biplane named Leadbottom). But what really undoes the movie is its seen-it-all-before familiarity Every crisis feels manufactured be it the egotistical machinations of the villainous Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith) or Dustys own third-act doldrums which milk parent-figure pathos in all the ways youd expect a Disney film to. The characters may soar but viewers spirits stay grounded.

With pit stops in four continents more cultural stereotypes than the Eurovision Song Contest and a scene where a French-Canadian flyer gets serenaded by mariachis in a pagoda its a great way to teach the kiddos about the rest of the planet while reinforcing the ideas that British planes dont cry Mexican planes love telenovelas and Indian planes giggle shyly while being followed around by blushing forklifts wearing saris.Will crop-duster Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook) make like Rocky and smoke his competition with a little help from his friends which include a moronic fuel truck (Brad Garrett) and a stern World War II fighter plane (Stacy Keach)? Take a guess. But even though Planes wouldnt know the word ""suspense"" if a skywriter puffed it into the air the questions it raises are bizarrely fascinating at least to adults. (To the kids credit an hour in I heard one bored tyke whine ""Mom can we go to the library?"")Lets start with the basics Who is Dusty dusting crops for? With no humans in Planess apparently post-humanoid world--look up Jon Negronis startling one-world Pixar Theory in which the Cars epoch follows the Wall-E collapse of primate civilization--growing corn unless perhaps for biofuel is a miserable task that would only make sense as a Sisyphean punishment. Our hearts leak transmission fluid when Dusty complains ""Ive flown thousands of miles and Ive never been anywhere."" But what if hes done something terrible to deserve it?Film Details Planes RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time92 More Info Trailer Thirty minutes in as Dusty finally wheels down the runway to begin his uplifting adventure its natural if your wandering mind might also ask when a plane becomes sentient. If were assuming a human-like timeline and also believe that life begins at ignition then Dustys most wizened ancestor can only hearken back to 110 years of history. Yet how thrilling to muse that maybe instead its the raw material--not the motors--that are alive and the iron ore destined to be forged into these Planes and Cars has been self-aware since it was burped from a volcano. And that with regular oiling it may live on for millennia perhaps even bearing witness to the collapse of the sun. How awe-inspiring be this machinery almost godlike in its scope and scale How much it owes its powerful offscreen deity the Unknown Welder And how ironically human is its dull day-to-day existence As Dustys underdog quest to finish first fuels an international media frenzy other planes are content merely to watch along on television. (Are the TV sets also alive? Will we get a movie about them?)Its at least clear that Dusty and his high-flying friends have read their Victorian science journals--or lacking hands listened to the books on tape. Planess society has full faith in Social Darwinism. Though Dusty can touch the clouds hes allowed no upward mobility. Instead hes mocked for his innate blueprint--as a wisecracking forklift (voiced by Sinbad seriously) jokes hes built for seed not speed. Even his friends find his dream of fast flight insane. And hes got it easy. If a heap of bolts is unlucky enough to get assembled as a forklift its forced to spend eternity in servitude as a planes lord or lady-in-waiting towing its masters to the tarmac buffing them with microfiber cloths and at best delivering a plucky speech when the boss is too frightened to fly.Lowest of all are the tractors who are quite literally a lesser species. On Dustys farm theyre treated with the benevolent condescension of a kid who rides the short bus; in Mumbai we realize that theyre actually more like cows. ""Many believe that we will be recycled as tractors"" coos Dustys crush the aforementioned Indian plane Ishani (Bollywood star and former Miss World Priyanka Chopra).By the time Planes gets to this scene if your restless toddler hasnt already dragged you out of the theater theres a good chance you might be thinking about death. Yes planes can die. But its hard. Theyre immune to disease seemingly immune to old age and impossible to drown. The best way to murder a talking plane appears to be explosives or like the T-1000 smelting it in lava. Hewing to Disney tradition Dustys parents are nonexistent or dead yet I kept hoping Dustys dad would apparate a la Hamlets father in the form of a ghostly data recorder. And as a final philosophical paradox following a bit where Dusty gets decked out with a new propeller and wings it feels imperative to know at which point in a RoboCop-esque rebuild does a plane stop being himself--and how a kids movie about accepting yourself reconciles having the lead character get a cockpit-to-rudder makeover. Its like if The Little Mermaid not only ended with Ariel keeping her legs but also getting liposuction and a nose job.Before these near-immortal flying machines conquer the planet here are humans worthy of mention director Klay Hall for trusting that kids want to see a cartoon obsessed with radials and trajectories and graph paper; the animators of the gorgeous 3D confetti battened between propellers at the races starting line; the casting genius who gave voice cameos to Top Guns Anthony Edwards and Val Kilmer; and writer Jeffrey M. Howard for naming a character Fonzarelli. Can a plane jump a shark when its already in the air? To Disney that question is moot. Its so certain that Planes will make a mint in toys if not in theaters that its already slated a sequel for next summer. And allegedly next on the assembly line Trains and Boats. All aboard?

"Planes Review Disneys Cars Spinoff Is a Clunker | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Planes Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 10 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr August 6 2013 | 0900PM PT This endlessly merchandisable picture could very well soar at the box office but it wont stick the landing where word of mouth is concerned. A ""Cars"" spinoff that seems to have taken an unfortunate detour through ""Its a Small World"" ""Planes"" is so overrun with broad cultural stereotypes that it should come with free ethnic-sensitivity training for especially impressionable kids. Produced outside the auspices of Pixar and showing it in every uninspired particular this formulaic underdog story -- about a lowly cropduster who dreams of joining the fast flyers in an international air race -- feels heavily geared toward small fry at the expense of grown-up interest. Diverting in bits and pieces but absent the heart soul and ingenuity one associates with the best of Disney animation the endlessly merchandisable picture could very well soar at the box office but it wont stick the landing where word of mouth is concerned.This story first appeared in the August 13 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Although the ""Cars"" movies rank relatively low in the estimation of most Pixar devotees they are known to occupy a special place in the heart of exec producer John Lasseter (chief creative officer of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios) and ""Planes"" does have some of the rural American charm of the first ""Cars"" and the globe-trotting sweep of the second. What it doesnt have in the hands of director Klay Hall and scribe Jeffrey M. Howard (both veterans of Disneys ""Tinker Bell"" homevid franchise) is the sophisticated story sense and visual pizzazz of even a middling Pixar effort. The film was originally slated for direct-to-video release this fall and while its upgrade to the theatrical big leagues stands to fill Mouse House coffers several times over the result feels like an indifferent smallscreen quickie through and through. A Creamsicle-colored single-propeller plane who spends his days spreading something called Vitaminamulch across the same stretch of Midwest cornfield Dusty Crophopper (voiced by comedian-actor Dane Cook) dreams of a more exciting less agriculture-focused life as a high-flying racer plane. Although hes roundly mocked by his bigger shinier rivals Dusty is speedier than he looks and after wowing the spectators at a local tryout succeeds in landing the coveted final spot in a prestigious race around the world. ""Maybe just maybe I can do more than what I was built for"" he says positioning himself alongside the improbable aspirational heroes of ""Ratatouille"" ""Turbo"" and numerous other fish-out-of-water toon fables. Naturally there must be some dramatic turbulence en route to the finish line some of which is supplied by the ironic revelation that Dusty has a fear of extreme heights and hopes to maintain a fairly low altitude during the race. Helping him to work on his moves and get over his phobia are his four-wheeled friends Chug (Brad Garrett) and Dottie (Teri Hatcher) who like most of the cars here are always on hand to provide their winged brethren with engine repairs cheers from the stands and overall moral support. But Dustys most valuable assistance comes from Skipper Riley (Stacey Keach) a long-retired Navy Corsair who used to fly daring missions during WWII and who plays the same crusty mentor role here that Paul Newmans Doc Hudson did in ""Cars."" So far so smooth. But ""Planes"" takes a major dip once the race begins and Dusty starts making his way east from New York. With the exception of the smug unscrupulous Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith) a world-champion racer determined to hold onto his title at any cost Dustys rivals almost all hail from different countries. Theres Bulldog (John Cleese) a stuffy emotionless Brit; Rochelle (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) a sleek dainty French-Canadian; Ishani (Priyanka Chopra) a striking Indian beauty who becomes an exotic love interest for Dusty; and El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui) a chubby boisterous Mexican whos also a wrestler telenovela star and recording artist. Funny accents and goofy shtick have of course long been a staple of toons for tots and in the surreally anthropomorphic human-free version of planet Earth that is ""Disneys World of Cars"" (as its billed in the opening credits) this sort of cultural lampoonery provides an easy access point and a steady vein of relatable humor. But by the time El Chupacabra serenades Rochelle with a makeshift mariachi band or when Dusty arrives in Asia and flies over a field of cars wearing bamboo hats the rampant stereotyping has long exceeded the limits of whats cute and acceptable for an ostensibly innocuous family entertainment. At the very least it makes for a dispiritingly repetitive one-joke movie. If the humor is often in questionable taste the dramatic beats play it far safer throwing in a few supporting-character twists that momentarily shake Dustys faith in his comrades but ultimately setting the brave little cropduster on a clear path to fulfilling his dreams overcoming his fears and realizing the value and meaning of friendship. Its pleasant life-affirming stuff unlikely to rattle the foundations of any but the youngest tots in the audience. Cook delivers a solid capable turn as a loyal good-hearted plane who often veers from overconfidence to insecurity although theres little he and his fine co-stars can do to deepen viewer investment in these chrome-and-steel characters never the easiest individuals to warm to even when theres a decent script involved. The smoothly animated aerial sequences add lovely visual grace notes while the detailed renderings of Iceland Germany India Nepal China and Mexico (where the racers make scheduled stops for refueling) provide nonstop visual variety. Overall however an underwhelming televisual quality persists; the riotous almost abstract blurs of motion and color that made ""Cars 2"" such a feast for the eyes are little in evidence here and the use of 3D doesnt add much to the experience. The end credits include a plug for the next picture in the series ""Planes Fire amp; Rescue"" set to be released theatrically July 18.

John Freimann says August 7 2013 at 1018 pm I believe that you might be wrong. Mr. Ebert was seldom ""brutal""; what he was was always ""fair"". Reply John McGettigan says August 7 2013 at 1126 am Mr. Chang Ive read a few of your pieces. I must say they can be brutal. But damned if I dont think the late great Ebert would be proud. Reply Kuan-Jen Mao says August 7 2013 at 251 am Thanks Justin CHANG for telling us what stereotypes and what quantity we should find offensive... Over and over and over again. How about making a some attempt at staying on point when reviewing a film? Maybe try focusing your word count on things like plot and pacing? And I really dont care what the merchandising outlook is on a movie either- its the first thing mentioned. Somehow I doubt it plays much of a part in the viewing experience- unless you happen to be buyer for Target. Reply guylodge says August 7 2013 at 300 am Actually the merchandising outlook is a key point in a review for a trade paper which is what Variety is. Reply Kuan-Jen Mao says August 7 2013 at 603 pm Fair enough. But I suspect Ebert would have gotten the ""something called Vitaminamulch"". Yes its an old reference but this guy do have ""Senior"" next to his name. Bill says August 7 2013 at 138 am Wow do people really live their lives getting this upset over supposedly offensive ""stereotypes?"" Reply Just Confused says August 6 2013 at 1057 pm Sorry John BUT Ive got to disagree. THIS reviewer is ""quickly"" becoming THE ONE to read. Go back and dig out his Woody Allen ""BLUE JASMINE"" for an amazingly in depth (yes it is l ---o-- -n--g) and brilliant review. VARIETY you are so lucky to have this guy I hope you appreciated him HIS review is the one I reach for FIRST ONE LAST WORD to JOHN...you spent YEARS learning HOW TO READ now make your underappreciated English teachers proud and spend a few minutes just doing it You think that review was long? Read any good BOOKS lately? SURELY you remember ""b-o-o-k-s? And NO Im not calling you SHIRLEY or am I JUST CONFUSED Reply John Freimann says August 6 2013 at 1003 pm Boy that was a long review. Actually I didnt even finish it. I got the gist in the first paragraph; so why read on. Amazing how boring a review can get. While telling everyone how they should have made their film perhaps they should apply some of that advise to their own writings. Reply Johnnie says August 7 2013 at 1031 am I agree. I just go to RT read the number and decide if a movie is good or not. If I have to you know read stuff then forget it. Tweet your opinion...if you must. And even thats kinda long but I can handle it. Reply davebaxter says August 6 2013 at 1039 pm Except you admit that you got the point in one paragraph (which is indeed the point of the initial summary paragraph). So obviously the writer did their job well. Just like in exercise if you can feel all the burn in a shorter motion that means your form is dead on but you should finish the full range of motion anyway.

Like Mike in ""Monsters University"" his dreams dont match his size; like Smurfette in ""The Smurfs 2"" he wants to forge a destiny different than the one he was born into; and like Turbo in ""Turbo"" he defies the odds to enter a race that no one thinks he can handle. As cookie-cutter and as shameless an attempt by Disney to sell more bedspreads and bookbags to the under-10 market as ""Planes"" is it nonetheless manages to be inoffensively entertaining a minor lark that will at least mildly amuse anyone who ever thrust their arms outward and pretended to soar over the landscape. And while this may be the definition of damning with faint praise ""Planes"" winds up being way more fun than either of the ""Cars"" movies in whose universe this globe-trotting tale takes place. Also read Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters Review The Silly All-Ages Fun of an Old Steve Reeves Hercules Movie Dusty (voiced by Dane Cook) as his name implies spends his days spraying mulch over farms. (And lest you wonder why there are crops in a world full of machines theres a throwaway line about corn-based fuels.) During his monotonous work hours however Dusty dreams of entering a round-the-world race thats reserved only for the sleekest and most powerful of planes. Thanks to the support of mechanic/forklift Dottie (Teri Hatcher) and best pal/fuel truck Chug (Brad Garrett) and coaching from war veteran/Navy Corsair Skipper (Stacy Keach) Dusty makes it to the big time. Most of the other racers are aloof to the little duster -- only the gregarious El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui) takes Dusty under his wings -- but our hero eventually wins over his competitors particularly after he saves the life of British racer Bulldog (John Cleese). See video Meet Dane Cooks Competition in Newest Planes Trailer Meanwhile returning champion Ripslinger (veteran voice actor Roger Craig Smith) commits every dirty trick possible to eliminate Dusty from the race lest the competition be overrun with ""skywriters and banner-draggers."" So you can pretty much guess where ""Planes"" is going and how its going to get there; what makes it fun to watch are the cool little touches provided by writer Jeffery M. Howard and director Klay Hall both making the leap to the big screen after toiling in the worlds of TV cartoons and made-for-DVD animated sequels. We know for instance that El Chupacabra is going to aggressively woo French-Canadian airplane Rochelle (Julia Louis-Dreyfus; ""Seinfeld"" viewers will get the joke behind the characters name) but turning the disco hit ""Love Machine"" into a soulful mariachi ballad makes for a nice surprise. And when Dusty takes flight with his South Asian love interest Ishani (Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra) they soar through a flock of paper cranes that scatter like seagulls in one of the films most visually compelling sequences. Also read Disney Animation Pixar Sets Release Dates Through 2018 If nothing else heres a movie thats made up almost entirely of flying scenes and offering up a POV from the clouds always bumps up the 3D experience a notch or two. ""Planes"" isnt one for the ages but in a summer full of ho-hum kids fare being a little better than OK counts as enough to sail above the competition. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
