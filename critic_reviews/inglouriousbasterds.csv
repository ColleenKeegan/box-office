Talked about for years by the filmmaker as his epic ""guys-on-a-mission"" movie the final product unveiled this morning in Cannes certainly meets those standards. The story of Nazi-hunting Jewish soldiers delivers on the colorful brand of unserious entertainment implied by the plot but no matter how much extreme contextualization and heavily stylized techniques Tarantino introduced to the production ""Inglorious Basterds"" feels like a bubblegum sidedish to the heavy dinner plate of his career. While not intentionally a rudimentary project it automatically becomes one by the limits of its design. In the opening scene Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) arrives at a house in the French countryside where he interrogates a man about hiding Jews in his basement. The sequence culminates with the Nazis discovering the family hidden beneath the floorboards killing all of them except for a young woman named Shoshanna (Melanie Laurent) who dashes into the forest. Except thats not really the opening scene because the first image of ""Basterds"" arrives on the heels of credits that beg to be considered as the true narrative introduction. Written in block letters aping the title cards associated with Sergio Leone Westerns while the jangly soundtrack follows suit they set the stage for the barrage of genre references to follow. Despite a World War II setting ""Inglourious Basterds"" mainly feels like an homage to crime and thriller movies using Nazis as cardboard villains in a facile manner akin to the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise. As the story shoots forward building into an espionage drama Tarantino churns out the most conventional accomplishment of his career ""Jackie Brown"" included. Sure you can tear apart the layers of references to countless genres from multiple eras but not with the same relish allowed by ""Kill Bill"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" where reading into the text and digging its natural flow were not mutually exclusive. Thats hardly the case here. To watch ""Basterds"" without considering Tarantinos implementation of enyclopedic movie knowledge makes it into a breezy insignificant experience. After introducing Shoshannas plight Tarantino shifts to the antics of the ""basterds"" a group of Jewish soldiers led by the fierce Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). Merrily capturing Nazis gleefully bashing their skulls and pocketing the scalps the basterds provide the makings of a typical revenge fantasy. Tarantino wittily cast scrawny Jewish men (""Hostel"" director Eli Roth and ""The Office"" star B.J. Novak among them) as the movies principle musclemen but that subtly ironic joke never reaches its potential. Thats because ""Basterds"" isnt really a jokefest; its a talk-fest. Anyone familiar with the Tarantino touch will testify that the director likes to make his characters talk and talk and talk - and sometimes so that it ends up absorbing the spotlight. In ""Basterds"" we see the worst side-effects of this tendency as much of the movie relies on chatter to propel it along the basic trajectory of a spy movie. Shoshanna emerges in the disguise of a non-Jewish theater owner in Paris where she manages to infiltrate the Nazis and scheme with the basterds to take them out. The ludicrous plot heads straight for a fiery climax that finds our heroes on a straightforward path to killing off Adolph Hitler Joesph Goebbels and prettty much everyone else at the head of the Third Reich. In an nice bit of self-referential irony they aim to pull it off at a movie theater while the Nazis view a screening of their own propaganda. So ""Basterds"" makes viewers watch a movie about killing Nazis in which Nazis watch a movie and get killed. Setting the stage for a slaughterfest Tarantino wants to craft an old-school entertainment by way of his favorite examples but the multiple layers prevent it from holding interest from scene to scene. ""Basterds"" has an arbitrary progression As Shoshanna plans her glorious retribution dialogue scenes go on and on people gets shot lavish music cues make way for interstitial moments of contemplation and so on. Get around to it already. Despite the injection of content from a variety of directions ""Basterds"" lacks the crackly excitement of Tarantinos other efforts mainly because he cant seem to tie the whole package together. Why does Samuel L. Jackson suddenly pop up on the soundtrack to narrate a fleeting background of the basterds evolution? If the movie pays tribute to Westerns how come we never get a single man-on-man confrontation the sort of climax that magically concluded ""Kill Bill""? The disconnected ingredients dont mean that the movie lacks the ability to deliver a good time but simply that it never rises above the sense of a juvenile cinephilic rush job and everyone knows Tarantino can do better than that.

"Review Basterds is quite glorious - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Basterds is quite gloriousStory Highlights ""Inglourious Basterds"" thrilling twist on war movies by Quentin Tarantino says critic CNN.coms Tom Charity Film opens with masterful scene sustains tension ""Basterds"" stars Brad Pitt as Nazi hunter Christoph Waltz as villain Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- When the British comedian Spike Milligan wrote a memoir about his experiences during World War II he called it ""Adolf Hitler My Part in His Downfall."" Eli Roth and Brad Pitt play some bloodthirsty Allied soldiers in ""Inglourious Basterds."" Unlike Milligan Quentin Tarantino was born 40 years too late to have played an active role in that enterprise but at least he shares Milligans chutzpah. Beginning with the precaution ""Once upon a time in Nazi-Occupied France ..."" -- part homage to Sergio Leone part disclaimer of historical authenticity -- ""Inglourious Basterds"" doesnt pretend to give us the war as it was but as it should have been. In this outrageous revisionist revenge fantasy not only do the Jews resist Hitler -- in the form of a crack U.S. guerrilla unit operating behind enemy lines and outside official jurisdiction -- but they terrorize the German army with the bloodcurdling ferocity of their reprisals. When Brad Pitts drawling Lt. Aldo Raine tells his platoon of misfits and sociopaths that each owes him 100 German scalps its not an idle pleasantry. Despite Pitts sadism this ""Dirty Dozen"" redux -- inspired by Enzo Castellaris 1978 exploitation film ""The Inglorious Bastards"" -- turns out to be the sketchiest component in an unexpectedly elaborate design dominated by Christoph Waltzs arch villain Col. Hans Landa. Watch the stars talk about making the movie >> Waltz will be unknown to most American audiences -- he was certainly unknown to me -- but hes nothing less than sensational as the silky polyglot SS officer charged by the Fuhrer to root out the remaining Jews in France. The long long first sequence -- or ""chapter"" as Tarantino terms it -- is essentially a 20-minute-plus two-character scene between Landa and a French farmer (played by Denis Menochet) where the SS man most graciously presumes on his hosts wary hospitality flattering him and his family even complimenting his milk. Dont Miss Villain steals Inglourious Basterds Tarantino and Pitt A long-awaited love affair The man is a tease but a deadly one. With every perfectly enunciated phrase he turns the screws tighter and tighter up to the point where the poor farmer is ready to tell him everything. Its a masterful scene bleakly comic and incredibly suspenseful and as bold in its way as anything Tarantino has done before. (Who starts an adventure movie with 30 pages of dialogue?) Before it is done we have developed a powerful antipathy to this brilliant vicious fellow Landa; it is clear that like so many of the most memorable screen villains he is a man we will love to hate. Tarantino doesnt hold back on nasty Nazis -- Goebbels and Hitler also figure as well as Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) a handsome young infantryman and movie buff who has become a national hero after shooting more than a hundred GIs and who is now starring as himself in Goebbels latest propaganda film. On the other side of the equation we find a glamorous German movie star who is actually an agent for the Allies (Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark) and Michael Fassbender as a British agent Lt. Archie Hicox sent as a liaison between Bridget and the ""Basterds"" because of his background as a film critic. (Only in a Tarantino movie do you find heroic critics.) And then theres Shosanna Dreyfus (the excellent Melanie Laurent) improbably the owner-operator of a Parisian movie theater the site on which all the major characters -- including der Fuhrer -- converge for Zollers premiere. In this film the cinema is everywhere and everything. For two and a half hours in the dark anything goes. Some critics have taken exception to this hubris even on moral grounds. Yet the movies have always exploited war and plundered history. Tarantino is just more up front about repurposing it than most. That first scene is no anomaly. Words speak louder than action and most of the brutality comes veiled in cagey cat-and-mouse conversation. Its so intricately constructed sometimes that the film threatens to turn into a screenwriting master class and you wish Tarantino would just get on with the plot. But then of course he does and engineers the kind of climax that threatens to bring the house down. ""Inglourious Basterds"" may or may not get Tarantinos career (and its producers The Weinstein Company) back on track. Its hard to see it converting many skeptics but the filmmakers fans should be more than satisfied and curious newbies will discover a dense literate audacious and prodigious talent still one of the best of his generation. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is rated R and runs 152 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys review click here.

His use of tension (Quentins Tension) his sincere homaging his absolute love of all things cinema -- I mean this is just a guy that ""gets it."" I know hes not for everyone. And I know this subject matter isnt appealing to most. But man if we could all just get over our preconceived notions and let Tarantino present his concepts I think wed be better off as a nation nay a world. World War II. The Nazis. A ruthless band of Americans (led by Brad Pitt) is inserted into the thick of it into enemy-controlled France. Their mission? To wreak havoc. To cause fear. To bring the fight to the Nazis. Weve seen filmmakers tackle every angle of this war from the measured and noble perseverance of Defiance to the horror of concentration camp discovery displayed in Band of Brothers. But weve never seen the joy of killing that must have occurred on the winning side the angry outlet of war where courage and nobility have left leaving only darkness blood and hurt on all sides. Tarantino tries here tries to point out the obvious that real people with flaws and families were involved that we would have had to send a few killers over there to sort things out. Because really no one can make sense of something this big 11 million people marched off to camps and killed an entire generation of Russians dead defending the capitol a new and fearsome weapon developed by the biggest intellects in the world and unleashed upon a citizenry. Its all too massive the scope is too epic and most efforts come off as sterile by comparison. Theres no way to impart the enormity of the situation so why not tell the story of one man? Or a group of survivors? Its the kind and gentle way out. Its comfortable. But its not true any more than the phrase ""six million Jews"" has the type of impact that it should. It should absolutely floor you each and every time. But the human emotional construct is built to deflect work around and simply move forward. We never put it together that these were all real people and thats the true horror of the situation that neighbors sold each other out that we sent some very bad people to do some very bad things and that occasionally a Nazi officer was a charming yet horrifying version of Mr. Rogers. Somehow once you wade through the one-liners silliness and brutality youre left with the heart of the film. You want the Nazis to be obliterated and not for noble reasons. Think of the hurt if someone took your sister wife or mom away from you. What would you want for that person? And isnt it empowering to see a filmmaker completely unafraid to give it to you? Yeah its the ugly side of humanity ... but its no less honest. If anything its more accurate given the hell that was occurring during this time period. War is terrible but the people involved on all side were humans with the human motivations of passion anger national pride and power. The most misleading thing about Inglourous Basterds is that its not even about Pitts group of guerrilla warriors. Its really the story of a girl in occupied Paris who runs a movie theater. Its a fantasy revenge epic. Its a cascade of characters all compelling all dynamic all thrown into the Tarantino stew. This is a fun movie which is terrible to say given the subject matter but its true. Tarantino has made the film that occurs in your head which you never ever tell anyone about. Hes laid bare the themes of familial obligation and revenge and hes done it with real beauty. The Nazis were evil for a number of complex reasons but Tarantino is nice enough to hate them for simple ones offering simple solutions. Like a bat to the head its not too subtle but you cant help but watch. Each and every scene has a giant shoe hanging over it just waiting to drop violence waiting to be strummed on Inglourious Basterds 12-string guitar. The only startling aspect? You want to hear the music.

That doesnt mean it isnt any good Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Quentin Tarantino thinks big and hes got balls. If that were enough to make a masterpiece ""Inglourious Basterds"" would surely be one. But ""Inglourious Basterds"" in addition to having already stirred controversy for its Jews vs. Nazis conceit is unwieldy long-winded self-indulgently nutso and in places very very boring. It also caps off its two-and-a-half-hour run time with an extended finale - partially orchestrated to David Bowies ""Cat People"" theme song no less - that I could watch again and again with pleasure. In other words Tarantino has taken a huge leap and made a movie that doesnt fully work which presents those of us who love his work hate his work or love-hate his work - which should cover just about everybody - with a confounding question Do we praise the leap or shake our fists at the result?In the weeks since I first saw ""Inglourious Basterds"" (I have now seen it twice) Ive done both. I love some of Tarantinos movies ""Death Proof"" the second half of the marvelous sleazeball double-feature ""Grindhouse""; the gruffly poetic ""Jackie Brown""; ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" which has all the soul its predecessor ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is missing. On the other hand I have little feeling for ""Pulp Fiction"" the movie that was supposed to launch a million great film directors of a new generation Its ambitious all right but the show-off smirkiness of its violence leaves me cold. Tarantinos movies can be endless catalogs of disembodied minutiae pictures cobbled together from the breathless patter of a former video-store nerd (as Tarantino once was) reciting the plots of every martial arts movie hes ever seen. They can also be exuberant celebrations of the vibe that has always driven trash-movie culture. Ive already written that all of Tarantinos movies - the bad ones as well as the good - are marked and energized by restlessness and Im not sure I can sum up his career (thus far) any better than that.You can almost hear that restlessness rattling like a persistent cough throughout ""Inglourious Basterds"" which is ostensibly an action movie although in reality its made up mostly of people talking. The plot involves a Nazi officer Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz in an elegant superbly controlled performance) whos earned the nickname ""the Jew hunter"" for his work in occupied France; an American officer Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) whos organized a special squad of Jewish-American soldiers whose job is ""killing Nazis"" (except as Aldo a Tennessee bootlegger says it it comes out ""killin Gnatzis""); and a beautiful young Jewish woman Emmanuelle Mimieux (Melanie Laurent) whos hiding in plain sight in Paris - she runs a movie theater and recognizes a golden opportunity when a Nazi soldier-slash-actor (played by Daniel Bruhl) arranges to hold the premiere of his new movie there with a group of Nazi bigwigs (including Hitler and Goebbels) in attendance.The wild cast of characters milling around in this unholy swirl also includes a top-notch Nazi killer known as ""the Bear Jew"" (played by torture-horror filmmaker Eli Roth) a purring German movie starlet turned spy (Diane Kruger) and an English officer and spy (Michael Fassbender) who puts his former profession as a movie critic to use in his new line of work. Did I forget to mention that Rod Taylor shows up as Winston Churchill?Its almost a miracle that to a person each of these actors gives a lively wide-awake performance - as a group they clearly have a grasp of what Tarantino is after even when we dont. Tarantino writes wonderful dialogue and some of the dialogue here is no exception. (Pitt has a terrific opening scene in which he plays deliciously with the rhythm of the language Tarantino has given him. He informs his men that he wants ""100 Gnatzi scalps"" After a pause he adds ""And I want my scalps"" After one last beat comes the capper ""Or you will die tryin"") But Tarantino gets lost in his own forest of language He creates elongated scenes filled with words (including a seemingly interminable one set in a Parisian basement tavern) to build an aura of menace. Thats a lot of building and in its first two-thirds the movie groans with the effort of sustaining all that tension.And yet in the final section - youll know its officially begun when you see the words ""Chapter Five"" on the screen although the soundtrack will cue you in even more viscerally - ""Inglourious Basterds"" scales heights that are simultaneously horrific and well glourious. Its also the section of the movie in which the ""Jews vs. Nazis"" showdown manifests itself most dramatically.Theres been a lot of buzz - some of it coming from people who have actually seen the movie and some coming from the always-more-vocal ones who havent - about Tarantinos hyper-fictionalization of World War II conflict. Some have asserted that hes trivializing the seriousness of the Holocaust. It bears mentioning that even though ""Inglourious Basterds"" addresses ""the hunting of Jews"" by Nazis its subject is most certainly not the death camps or the mechanized slaughter of Jews. (And in a tense beautifully sustained opening scene Tarantino acknowledges - briefly but succinctly - the horror of the fate of the Jews under the Third Reich.) Even beyond that though in some minds the idea of Jews banding together aggressively to kick Nazi ass is itself offensive. By now almost everyone has forgotten with good reason last years dreary ""Defiance"" which is based on a true and inherently compelling story about real-life Jewish brothers who brutally fought the Nazis. But I see Tarantinos movie more as a manifestation of the kind of crude moral justice that fiction - if not fact - can allow us. To me the aggressively fictional ""Jews vs. Nazis"" conflict in ""Inglourious Basterds"" is analogous to ""Santa Claus vs. the Martians"" an easily readable bit of cartoon shorthand for good vs. evil. Come on - you know whose side youd be on. You Might Also Like But I wonder if ""Inglourious Basterds"" might prove controversial to movie fans for another reason With the exception of a few scenes (one involving a skull-bashing baseball bat another featuring a finger being pressed jiggled and wiggled into a leg wound) the violence in ""Inglourious Basterds"" didnt strike me as excessively brutal. My hunch is that Tarantino isnt particularly interested in violence as a part of telling this story. What hes most interested in is the language - visual aural and oral - of movies. And even if I cant fully love ""Inglourious Basterds"" I can wholly embrace Tarantinos desire to explore that language.Throughout his career Tarantino has often been guilty of showing off how much he knows about movies sometimes to the point of being a bore (as in ""Kill Bill Vol. 1). But over the years hes gotten better at integrating that knowledge and affection into his work instead of wielding it like a billy club. Now when he borrows and name-drops he often does so with a sense of mischief and fun Watching ""Inglourious Basterds"" longtime movie enthusiasts will be able to spot the visual nods to ""The Searchers""; if theyve seen any 70s Giallo starring the Algerian-born actress Edwige Fenech theyll giggle when they note that the character Mike Myers plays in a tiny role is named Gen. Ed Fenech; they may not know - I didnt - who Lilian Harvey was. (She was the half-English half-German UFA movie star of the 1930s who stood up to the Nazis and was forced to leave Germany first for France and then for Hollywood.) But thats what Google is for after all.""Who cares about Lilian Harvey?"" you may be saying. But the fact that Tarantino cares about more than just showing heads getting bashed in says something about him as a filmmaker and also something about a culture of moviegoing in America that appears to be dying. Sure Tarantino may be guilty of a little too much inside baseball. Its one thing to see ""Inglourious Basterds"" in a roomful of movie critics who all stroke their chins knowingly when they catch a snippet of Lalo Schifrin or Ennio Morricone on the soundtrack. Movie critics for better or worse are the Men Who Knew Too Much and Will Happily Spend Two Hours Telling You About It. (And I say that with as much love as annoyance.) I can see how real-life moviegoers might be frustrated or flummoxed by Tarantinos constant parade of references. At the same time in a film culture informed largely by mindlessly enthusiastic fanboys -- where the references that moviegoers fall in love with dont extend much further back than ""Why so serious?"" -- maybe we need Tarantino and other filmmakers who like him have some knowledge of the past. ""Inglorious Basterds"" may as well have been made according to the nerds textbook of filmmaking. (I think the section on ""Searchers""-style doorway framing begins on page 3682 for those of you playing along at home.)But I also think that at this point in his career Tarantinos vision is opening wider instead of closing in on itself. ""Inglourious Basterds"" was shot the old-fashioned way The camera is stationary throughout rather than held by hand - huzzah (The cinematographer is frequent Scorsese collaborator Robert Richardson who has also worked with Tarantino in the past.) Tarantino pays careful attention not just to framing shots in a cool way but also to orchestrating movement within the frame During his big finale he shows us Emmanuelle Mimieux (again a name thats a double whammy of movie references) alone in the projection booth of her theater draped in a red satin dress - as she moves among the film cans and projectors shes like a solitary figure from an Edward Hopper painting come to life. Tarantino is only growing stronger at processing and synthesizing the visuals hes spent a lifetime absorbing The finale of ""Inglourious Basterds"" contains hints of the meticulous grand-scale splendor of De Palma and of the tightly wound clock-ticking tenseness of Coppola at his best.It also contains elements borrowed from Looney Tunes but thats Tarantino for you. In the past few weeks Ive heard colleagues refer to Tarantino as both a genius and a guy whos finally gone off his rocker and everything in between. Maybe its the ""everything in between"" that really matters. One of the movies final images is a face projected on a wall of smoke an image so illusory and so beautiful that it makes you want to reach toward the screen to touch it. With the highly imperfect ""Inglourious Basterds"" Quentin Tarantino seems to be hanging on to a lost world of moviemaking. He may be nuts. But hes a nut who cares.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor August 21 2009 Save for later Saved Actor Brad Pitt is shown in a scene from ""Inglourious Basterds."" Francois Duhamel/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Quentin Tarantinos ""Inglourious Basterds"" - his misspellings not mine - is a self-described fairy tale. Being that this is a Tarantino film you can be sure its closer to one of Grimms more ghastly escapades than to ""Sleeping Beauty."" In this World War II fantasy top Nazis get obliterated by Jewish avengers.The film is divided into five chapters each given its own heading. The first chapter which is shot in the slow-burn panoramic style of a spaghetti western is titled ""Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France."" Subsequent chapters likewise have the look and feel of different moviemaking genres although 1960s ""Dirty Dozen""-ish stylistics predominate.What does this filmic fandango add up to? Tarantino who looks at life through a viewfinder sees film as the ultimate righter of wrongs. Through the magic of movies he overturns the Holocaust. Who needs bummers like ""Schindlers List"" and ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" or even the historically based ""Defiance"" which featured Jews killing Nazis but was mucked up by all those pesky debates about morality? In a recent interview in The Atlantic Tarantino says ""Holocaust movies are always having Jews as victims.... Weve seen that story before. I want to see something different. Lets see Germans that are scared of Jews. Lets not have everything build up to a big misery lets actually take the fun of action-movie cinema and apply it to this situation."" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? His ""fun"" here involves a band of Jewish American revengers headed up by Brad Pitts perpetually chin-jutting non-Jewish Lt. Aldo Raine who specialize in scalping Nazis and carving swastikas into their foreheads. The most intimidating of the Basterds is a baseball-bat-wielding hulk known as ""Bear Jew"" (played by Eli Roth the sicko-horror film director). Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Inglourious Basterds A parallel story line has Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) who alone escaped the massacre of her family in the opening chapter plotting her payback three years later as the owner under an assumed identity of a movie theater in occupied Paris. It seems the Nazi high command wants her theater to premiere a new German movie ""A Nations Pride"" starring war hero Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) a sort of Teutonic Audie Murphy who is smitten by Shosanna. Since the nitrate film housed in the theater is highly flammable she sees a way to turn the event into a caldron of retribution.Theres lots more plot in this 2-1/2-hour fantasia and despite its action-movie origins lots of talk. Its the least virtuosic movie Tarantino has ever made. Many of the sequences drag on unduly especially an early scalping scene which could have been scalped by at least 10 minutes and several set pieces involving a German glamour queen and Allied secret agent (Diane Kruger). As is standard with Tarantino the baddest of the bad guys get the best dialogue - in this case the dreaded Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) who first decimates Shosannas family and then carries on from there.Landa is such a wily and despicable concoction that in movie terms hes almost impossible not to like. And therein lies part of my problem with this movie. Tarantino may have set out to make a World War II film where the Jews come out on top but he cant resist indulging in the same old penny dreadful shenanigans as all the other pulpmeisters who feature villains you love to hate. No one else in ""Inglourious Basterds"" comes close to Landa for sheer charisma.Tarantino who is not Jewish may be genuine in his desire to make the un-""Schindlers List"" but theres absolutely no irony no pathos in his game plan. Doesnt he realize that making a righteous fantasy about the Jewish incineration of the Nazi brass only reinforces the sad reality that tragically this never happened? Knowing what we know how can we look at this film and cheer?I have another large difficulty with this film. Tarantinos fantasy implies that if only there had been Jews like the Basterds there would not have been an Auschwitz. This ahistoric revisionism is pure malarkey but it may seep into the moviegoing consciousness of audiences including young Jewish audiences who might come to believe that a few roving bands of renegade Jewish scalpers might have terminated this whole Holocaust thing.Thats the trouble with filmmakers like Tarantino. Their heads are so crammed with old movies that they confuse movies with real life. And what may have been intended as a screw-loose tribute to Jewish gumption ends up its opposite.

Star Tribune Eli Roth and Brad Pitt in ""Inglourious Basterds"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Im tempted to say Tarantino has done it again but I doubt anyone has ever done anything like his dazzlingly original World War II movie ""Inglourious Basterds."" If you expect a ""Dirty Dozen"" knockoff where a squad of kill-crazy commandos run wild behind enemy lines think again. This is not a team-on-a-mission yarn nor a Brad Pitt star vehicle. Its an ominous comedy and a prankish drama. Its a showcase for ornate dialogue at least half of it in subtitled German or French. Its a war movie without battlefields a postmodern period picture a disco and funk soundtrack an egregiously gory movie that lampoons screen violence. Its classic quirky quintessential Quentin. The story unfolds over the course of five chapters each filmed in a distinctive visual style and boasts a gallery of memorably sketched characters. The vortex of stories complex enough for a triple feature meshes nimbly events intersecting and advancing one another. The curtain-raiser is ""Once Upon a Time ... in Nazi-Occupied France"" a title that recalls Sergio Leones spaghetti westerns more than war films. The scene is an extended duel of wits between jovial Gestapo Col. Hans ""The Jew Hunter"" Landa (Christoph Waltz) and a tense French farmer. The officer enters the dairymans cottage requests a glass of milk and coaxes out information about hidden Jews. Landa is a beast who behaves like a gentleman the debonair intelligent embodiment of European sophistication. He probes the farmer with understated threats and soft-spoken promises; every bantering exchange raises the stakes and the apprehension. The writing tops anything Tarantino has done to date. The climax arrives not in the expected spray of blood -- QTs been there done that -- but a flurry of sawdust. Young Shoshonna Dreyfus escapes but no one acquainted with Tarantinos avenging heroines will expect her to vanish entirely. Enter Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine (Pitt) and his squad of eight G.I. Jews. The tone shifts to gory farce as Pitt in a hillbilly twang commands his crew to scalp 100 Nazis each as payback for their anti-Semitic brutality. Aldo is so casual about baseball bat executions and Bowie knife mutilation that the bloodshed is almost comical. ""Watchin Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to goin to the movies"" he drawls. INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for graphic violence language and brief sexuality. The baton is passed again and were into ""Cinema Paradiso"" romance as a film-buff German soldier (Daniel Bruhl) genially woos an aloof Parisian moviehouse owner (Melanie Laurent). ""If you are so desperate for a girlfriend"" she sniffs ""I suggest you try Vichy."" Another shift of the gears and the film accelerates into a foreign intrigue thriller. The German high command will all be in attendance as propaganda minister Goebbels unveils his morale-building epic ""Nations Pride"" in a Paris theater with a library of highly flammable nitrate film. Characters converge and clash as competing plots emerge to assassinate the Reichs leaders and end the war in one swift stroke. Tarantino takes his sweet time pulling it all together. The film stretches on for 2 1/2 hours. But it isnt dull. The rhythm of tense waiting and quick-draw violence is hypnotic almost sensual. Why rush? Tarantino wants us to savor the last morsel of every sequence to digest each visual nuance (ace cinematographer Robert Richardson outdoes himself) and every narrative device. The film is deliberately excessive teeming with supporting players who could carry a film on their own. Til Schweiger plays a psycho German soldier who joins the Basterds after killing 13 officers; hes as tranquil and threatening as a coiled cobra. Michael Fassbender (who played skeletal IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands in ""Hunger"") is a heroic film critic () with a purring hauteur worthy of George Saunders. Diane Krueger is Mata Hari-mysterious as a German film star and undercover agent who may be leading the commandos into a trap. Good as Pitt is the breakout performance is Waltz as the charmingly despicable Col. Landa a villain so clever intelligent and underhanded that he turns World War II into his own private con game. His dry delivery which spans four languages earned him the best actor award at this years Cannes Film Festival and will surely draw attention come Oscar time. The films beyond-spectacular climax is a thing of awful beauty. A white-tie crowd of German film executives cheers as the hero of Goebbels film-within-a-film mows down hundreds of Allied soldiers. Tarantino reframes the spectacle and reenacts it handing us a rip-roaring rabble-rousing ""Kill Adolf"" revenge fantasy thats cathartic on the surface but troubling on a deeper level. If youre a Tarantino fan youll adore his most accomplished work yet. If youre not this one-stop film festival may be the experience that turns you into one.

""Inglourious Basterds"" Movie Review -- Quentin Tarantinos ""Inglourious Basterds"" is filled with vicious Nazis British spies American commandos and French collaborators all deceiving and destroying one another in occupied Paris. But it is not a movie about the war. It is a movie about war movies. Inglourious Basterds (R) Miramax (152 min.) Directed by Quentin Tarantino. With Brad Pitt Eli Roth. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains gory violence and strong language. This disconnect has been a Tarantino hallmark for a long time and its both his greatest strength as an entertainer and his biggest hurdle as an artist. On one hand his films offer enough skillful homages to delight any film geek; on the other they often lack their own identity. This tendency gives his art layers -- and insulates it from life. On paper ""Inglourious Basterds"" -- the illiterate spelling is never really justified -- is about an American officer who leads Jewish-American commandos on raids through occupied France. At first theyre merely content to kill and mutilate German soldiers; eventually they decide on a single crippling attack on the Reichs high command. On the screen though the entire movie -- which is almost insultingly unconcerned with the real war -- is a collection of its creators influences. The title is taken from an old Italian B-movie; the commandos final mission owes plenty to ""The Dirty Dozen."" The soundtrack is studded with modern pop and selections from the movie scores of Ennio Morricone. The result can be disorienting.

"Inglourious Basterds - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Christoph WaltzMOVIE REVIEW Inglourious BasterdsQuentin Tarantinos World War II movie has blood but its heart doesnt beat.August 21 2009|Kenneth Turan | FILM CRITIC Here are a few of my not-favorite things scalps graphically removed throats savagely slashed heads brutally beaten by baseball bats necks forcibly strangled fingers sadistically twisted in open wounds. The ideal person to be reviewing Quentin Tarantinos violent World War II fantasia ""Inglourious Basterds"" I am not but as the Basterds knew all too well sometimes a man has to do what a man has to do.Not that there arent elements to savor in ""Basterds"" or for that matter in Tarantinos public persona. He has a huge enthusiasm for movies of all kinds -- who else is going to champion the Roy Rogers films of William Witney -- and judging by his public appearances access to endless live-wire energy. But at this point in his career frankly it feels like his personality is stronger than his films.For one of the curious things about ""Basterds"" the above list of violent acts notwithstanding is that it is simultaneously bloody and bloodless. Clocking in at 2 hours and 32 minutes it is unforgivably leisurely almost glacial a film that loses its way in the thickets of alternative history and manages to be violent without the start-to-finish energy that violence on screen usually guarantees.That lack of vigor almost seems to be what the writer-director is after. For one thing though this film was inspired by a 1978 ""Dirty Dozen"" knockoff that was more conventional both in the spelling of its title and its story ""Basterds"" splits the narrative focus into three.The plot alternates among a group of bloodthirsty Jewish American GIs under the command of Lt. Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine (Brad Pitt) a fugitive Jewish woman named Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) who owns a movie theater in Paris and a German SS officer Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) who specializes in ferreting out Jews. (The Jewish element may sound strong but its just a plot construct The characters might as well be renegade Benedictine monks for all the difference it makes).As if this split werent enough ""Basterds"" breaks itself up yet again this time into a series of chapters more or less self-contained set pieces that play less like elements of a coherent whole than like a series of linked short films. Some of these set pieces have their virtues but more than a few of them go on too long and by emphasizing the films episodic nature hamper its ability to hold together as a feature.Also getting in the way is Tarantinos inevitable self-indulgence his willingess to please himself by choosing movie moments over genuine emotion making a point of having Frenchwoman Shosanna for instance say ""We respect directors in our country."" As it goes on and on ""Inglorious Basterds"" feels increasingly like the kind of hollow fanboyish cinema that is all the rage these days.To be fair to ""Inglourious Basterds"" it starts out more promising than it ends. Opening ""Once upon a time . . . in Nazi-occupied France"" it immediately introduces us to its most polished most successful character Landa beautifully played by German-born Waltz who took the best actor award at Cannes for this performance.So sophisticated that the plot demands he speak four languages fluently (Tarantino said he almost gave up on the film when he despaired of finding an actor with this linguistic ability) the colonel is a classic movie Nazi oozing odious evil in German French English and Italian and graphically showing us why he came by his nickname the Jew Hunter.Having just as much fun is Pitt who seems more relaxed and comfortable in these comic character parts than in conventional leading man roles. His Aldo the Apache a direct descendent of mountain man Jim Bridger with an accent to match does not mince words when he gives his squad of eight their behind-the-German-lines marching orders. The Nazis he says need to be ""dee-stroyed."" And the man himself personally requires 100 Nazi scalps from each of his men.Not having any fun at all as might be expected is on-the-run Shosanna. Yes her theater in Paris gets to show terrific films like the German mountain epic ""The White Hell of Pitz Palu"" and French director Henri-Georges Clouzots corrosive ""Le Corbeau."" But her life is in constant danger and to make things worse Frederick Zoller (""Good Bye Lenins"" Daniel Bruhl) a cheerfully obnoxious German war hero wont stop pestering her.The chapters of ""Inglourious Basterds"" at first focus on these plot strands one by one but by the time they all come together in a finale that rewrites history with a particularly Tarantino flourish it is hard to care what happens to anyone in them.Despite nods to notions like Jewish revenge and the power of cinema the director has paid so much attention to the films peripherals he has neglected to provide a center worth embracing. You can raise B pictures to A picture status as Tarantino has made a career out of doing but giving them A picture value is not so easily done.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--Inglourious BasterdsMPAA rating R for strong graphic violence language and brief sexualityRunning time 2 hours 32 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESOscar predictions 2013 We call the four acting racesFebruary 23 2013Django Unchained a brazen bloody spectacle critics sayDecember 26 2012Projector Les Miz and Django enter the Christmas mixDecember 24 2012Django unchained looks at U.S. pastDecember 15 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTChristoph WaltzInglourious BasterdsCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-basterds21-2009aug21,0,1767289.story",200,inglouriousbasterds9,inglouriousbasterds,latimes

Now add another No one but his most ardent fans will be entirely glad that Quentin Tarantino did make Inglourious Basterds . The rest of us are left to shake our heads and perhaps wag our fingers pondering this weird hybrid of a movie with an equally strange mix of emotions - wonder regret tedium fleeing moments of admiration extended patches of annoyance. Ostensibly hes turned out a Second World War flick but right from the fable-like intimation of the opening crawl - ""Once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France"" - its abundantly clear that we aint watching the history channel. Instead imposing his pulp fiction onto an era of tragic fact Tarantino has twisted the war into a fantasy that is part revenge yarn part gleeful propaganda and part wish-fulfilment - the wish being that movies werent merely his personal obsession but the free worlds literal saviour.Thats quite the concoction yet as it spills over 21/2 hours theres surprisingly little froth in the brew and scant juice in the pulp. War reduced to pop entertainment should at least be easy to swallow but this stuff keeps getting stuck in our craw. The trash that Tarantino used to elevate he now imitates.Some of the imitation is dazzling yet its still mere mimicry. Consider the first and best of the films five chapters. Rural France 1941. An SS officer Colonel Landa is interrogating a local farmer about the whereabouts of a Jewish family. Thats a stock tableau. But as the colonel Christoph Waltz steals the scene (and later the entire picture) with a virtuoso display of unctuous politeness wedded to venal cunning. Speaking in German to his henchmen in French to the farmer then switching to English to keep everyone off balance Waltz glides fluidly among the languages just as the sequence moves seamlessly from menace to comedy and back again with Tarantino superbly orchestrating the suspense.Structurally the episode is reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson interrogating the college kids at the start of Pulp Fiction . However that scene took stock characters and exploded the cliche; here both the stereotypes and the cliche remain intact - skillfully adorned but nothing more.And thats as good as it gets. The second segments revenge plot quickly degenerates into farce occasionally threatening to plunge even deeper into offensive farce. The slide begins with Brad Pitts twitching mustache and twangy Southern drawl. He heads a lethal unit of Jewish commandos who spreading fear wherever they roam beat Nazi heads with baseball bats just before taking their scalps - like slugging Hank Greenberg in Geronimos warpaint. Oh its enough to make the Fuhrer furious. Quick cut to a spitting-mad Adolf flapping his arms and spewing his venom. Clearly the fellow needs to chill out maybe take in an uplifting propaganda movie.Well wouldnt you just know it. Flash-forward to 1944 Paris where the entire high command - Goebbels Bormann Goering Hitler himself - have gathered for the premiere of yes an uplifting propaganda movie. This one stars the ""German Sergeant York"" (Daniel Bruhl) an actual war hero also in town for the screening. So are all the other principals - Pitt and the boys the multilingual Landa a Dietrich-like double agent (Diane Kruger) and the beautiful Jewish woman (Melanie Laurent) from the first chapter who having escaped just happens to be running the art deco theatre that the Nazis have chosen to house their premiere.Oops I forgot to mention my personal favourite the British film critic assigned by London to pose as a German cineaste and infiltrate the gala. Finally. The snooty-critic-as-action-hero is a sadly neglected trope in the war movie genre.Unfortunately convening such a sizable crowd comes with a price - lots of awkward exposition that slows the picture to a crawl. Rhythm and pacing and snappy dialogue are Tarantino trademarks but all three go for long disappearing acts amid this stylized fog of war. They intermittently return most notably during another beautifully staged sequence in a Parisian bistro. Yet even there when allied spies are rubbing shoulders with Nazi revellers the payoff feels stale - just another Mexican standoff ripped from the frames of Reservoir Dogs . A director of many influences Tarantino has always been a gifted thief and he again steals liberally here - not least alas from himself.When the climax comes and that theatre filled with flammable film stock stands poised to do its explosive duty the biggest pounding emanates from our puzzled heads. What in hell does any of this mean? Obviously deception is a recurring theme - the duplicity found in the many stacked performances (actors playing characters disguised as other characters) the lies embedded in each of the multiple languages and the calculated forgery that is cinema itself. Yet its a theme that leads nowhere that isnt bolted to any broader foundation of understanding.In that sense Inglourious Basterds reproduces the idea of a propaganda film but has no idea of its own to sell. That might have been an interesting contradiction since the peddling of ideas and their attendant values is the whole point of propaganda. If so its a contradiction Tarantino is unwilling or unable to explore. Hes content instead to stick this fabricated yarn into his usual moral vacuum where values dont exist and where the alleged villain of the piece the SS colonel is actually its most compelling figure. Sure its true that Satan is the most compelling figure in Paradise Lost  but Milton stops short of endorsing the guy. In his office as the high priest of pulp Tarantino has no such compunction - whether Nazi butchers or Jewish Apaches its all the same good fun to him.As for the misspelling in the title hes called it ""just an artistic stroke"" although perhaps thats immodest. The title may be a small stroke; most everything that follows is a full hemorrhage.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 20 2009 547 PM The Good the Bad and the Nazis Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds. By Dana Stevens Inglourious Basterds When it comes to representing the Holocaust on film you cant win. Unless were talking about Oscars in which case you cant lose. Set a melodrama in a concentration camp ( Schindlers List) and the result is sentimental kitsch that wins seven Oscars. Extend any sympathy to the Nazis ( The Reader) and you wind up with a morally repugnant tearjerker--that earns its lead actress an Oscar. (The most enjoyable thing about The Reader was the degree to which it resembled that Extras episode in which Kate Winslet as herself tells Ricky Gervais shes doing a Holocaust movie purely as a grab for the gold.) Putting a German army uniform on a contemporary American actor (Tom Cruise in Valkyrie) makes for instant risibility while placing a beautiful movie star in a fake concentration camp (Meryl Streep in Sophies Choice) could be said to make a mockery of the real victims undocumented suffering. The worst Holocaust movies may be those that aim for tragicomic uplift Life Is Beautiful Jakob the Liar or Jerry Lewis never-released The Day the Clown Cried. Perhaps Claude Lanzmann who directed the 10-hour WWII documentary Shoah is right and the Holocaust shouldnt be represented on film at all (or for that matter called ""the Holocaust"" a term which suggests sacrificial and redemptive suffering and which Lanzmann rejected for that reason.) Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The event thats become (rightly or wrongly) our eras signifier for absolute evil poses huge questions to any artist who chooses to address it questions that are ideological moral theological and aesthetic. Quentin Tarantino cheerfully ignored them all--well all but the aesthetic ones--as he plowed into the making of Inglourious Basterds (filmed largely at the historic Babelsberg studios in Germany). Tarantinos bravado his sheer oblivious American buffoonery accounts for this movies raw pop power and for the aftertaste of shame and nausea it leaves behind. Advertisement Inglourious Basterds is divided into numbered and titled chapters that trace a converging group of stories from 1941-44. In an impeccably constructed opening sequence as indebted to spaghetti Westerns as it is to WWII classics like The Great Escape a French farmer suspected of harboring Jews (Denis Menochet) is interrogated by an SS officer Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Landa is known as ""the Jew-hunter"" and without giving away too much I can say that he more than lives up to the name. But at least one Jew a young woman named Shoshanna (Melanie Laurent) manages to escape the farm. Four years later Shoshanna is living in Paris operating a movie house under an assumed name. Meanwhile the Basterds members of an all-Jewish U.S. army unit known for its merciless treatment of prisoners--""Bring me 100 Nazi scalps"" barks their commander Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt)--are recruited by British intelligence in a plot to assassinate the Nazi high command aided by a famous German actress (Diane Kruger) whos secretly working for the Allies. Like Spielberg Tarantino is director enough to elicit cinematic wows even at his most reprehensible. Though Basterds is overlong and undisciplined it contains individual set pieces--that opening encounter in the French farmhouse and a later scene in which the Basterds go undercover as German officers in the basement of a tavern--that are near-perfect examples of taut suspenseful moviemaking. The dialogue snaps the score (by Ennio Morricone) swells and many of the visual ideas (like a shot of Shoshanna in her Deco movie house that recalls an Edward Hopper painting of a lonely usherette) are breathtaking. And as always Tarantinos casting is bold counterintuitive and generally spot-on. Brad Pitt overacts genially and enjoyably as the Tennessee-accented folk-wisdom-spouting Lt. Raine. Austrian actor Christoph Waltz switching elegantly from French to German to English runs away with the movie as the exquisitely sadistic Col. Landa. Diane Kruger the German beauty whos always struck me as mousy in her English-speaking roles (Troy Copying Beethoven) plays her double-or-possibly-triple-crossing character with sexy verve. And smaller roles like the British film critic turned spy Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) are cast with types straight from an old black-and-white movie. The debonair Fassbender could be easily imagined trading rapid-fire quips with Alec Guiness. But Tarantinos signature nastiness and his juvenile delight in shocking the audience undercut the movies larger purpose. Which is what again? Watching someone get beaten to death with a baseball bat or having a swastika carved into their flesh in tight closeup is sickening whether the victim is a Nazi or not. In the scenes where the bloodthirsty Basterds (one of whom is played by Eli Roth the director of the ultra-sadistic Hostelmovies and a friend of Tarantinos) perpetrate these exploits are we supposed to be cheering them on? Is the best way to work through the atrocities of the 20th century really to dream up ironically apt punishments for the long-dead torturers? As a cathartic fantasy about kicking Nazi ass Inglourious Bastards falls short even of last years pallid Defiance. The scenes showing the Basterds in action offer plenty of Nazi-bashing but theyre dramatically inert. We learn nothing about for example why the unit is under the command of the gentile Lt. Raine or how the soldiers relate to him or to one another. The death camps are never directly mentioned perhaps because Tarantino sensed that acknowledging their existence would shatter the movies carefully maintained half-mocking tone. The idea of an all-Jewish unit is a joke that arrives fully formed and never goes anywhere. If Inglourious Basterds is offensive--and in spots its wildly so--its not because Tarantino tries to bring Hitler and comedy together. Thats been done before--by Charlie Chaplin Ernst Lubitsch and others--back when the wound of the war was much fresher. The queasiness comes in when the movie unproblematically offers up sadistic voyeurism as a satisfying form of payback. As hes trying to extract information from a German soldier Brad Pitts character speaks a line that could function as the movies motto ""Watching Germans get beat to death is as close as we get to going to the movies."" Tarantinos radical rewriting of the wars ending is audacious and perversely enthralling. But if Inglorious Basterds were about something more than the cinematic thrill of watching Nazis suffer itcould have been a revelation.

Now with the irredeemably silly if never never dull ""Inglourious Basterds"" he takes on World War II and tries to wrestle it to the ground. The spelling of the title is a jape. So it seems is the movie itself which unspools in a series of interlocking chapters. They include the saga of French-Jewish Shosanna (Melanie Laurent). As a teenager she witnessed the brutal murder of her family concocted a new identity for herself as owner of an Art Deco movie house in German-occupied Paris and now plots revenge. In another part of the wars European theater Mr. Tarantino focuses on a small band of mostly Jewish misfits and malcontents--think ""The Dirty Half-Dozen""--who hunt down Nazis with a stealth and ferocity and success rate that infuriates Der Fuhrer here played like the Reichs propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels as a cartoonish buffoon. The basterds are led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) whose artificially heavy corn-pone accent suggests a road-company production o f ""Lil Abner."" ENLARGE Eli Roth and Brad Pitt as guerrilla Nazi-hunters in Inglourious Basterds. Below adman Lee Clow in Art amp; Copy. Weinstein Co. All the trademark Tarantino flourishes are here--the joyous splaying of gore; the self-referential dialogue (""Were French. We respect directors in our country.""); the artful artificiality and the juxtaposition of humor and violence--but they dont add up to much. In fact nothing about the emotionally unmoored ""Inglourious Basterds"" adds up. Whether its parody farce or a fever dream is anyones guess. Its self-indulgent for sure--consider the close-up of schlag mounded luxuriously over a slab of strudel and of a swastika the basterds carve on a Nazis forehead. Certainly nothing that follows equals the chilling heart-stopping brilliance of the movies first scene An S.S. colonel (the superb Christoph Waltz)--all suave silky charm--pays a visit to a French dairy farmer suspected of hiding Jews. Never has a request for a glass of milk been quite so terrifying. My One and Only The famously bronze actor George Hamilton hasnt always been the most colorful person in the room. For years that honor belonged to his mercurial glamorous mother Ann. So suggests the disarming ""My One and Only"" a screwball comedy/road picture set in 1953 and based on Mr. Hamiltons life long before Hollywood--and the sun--got so hot for him. When stunningly self-absorbed former Southern belle Ann Devereaux (Renee Zellweger in fine form) catches her philandering society bandleader husband Dan (Kevin Bacon) in the act she reacts with admirable sang-froid. She rounds up her 14-year-old son George (Logan Lerman) and 16-year-old effeminate stepson Robbie (Mark Rendall)--a task complicated by the fact that she hasnt a clue where they go to school--and the trio high-tails it out of Manhattan in search of a new and better husband for Mom. Equal parts Auntie Mame Pollyanna and Scarlett OHara Ann reconnects with a series of old beaux she fervently--if wrongly--believes will be Mr. Right. The group includes a ruined businessman (Steven Weber) who ransacks Anns purse then leaves her with the very steep dinner check and a martinet career military man (Chris Noth). An attractive man at the bar of a posh hotel looks like a divine prospect; wouldnt you just know hes a house detective who arrests Ann for prostitution. Then theres the gallant paint-store owner who wants Ann to be his wife. Unfortunately he already has a wife. This sort of thing happens a lot as the family makes its way across the country finally ending up in Hollywood. Despite some cliched set-pieces--for example the narcissistic father clumsily telling his son he doesnt have room for him in his life then trying to soften the blow with a wad of cash--the unassuming ""My One and Only"" keeps its balance and momentum. Maybe the subject matter--a George Hamilton biopic--all but guarantees low expectations and ensures an excess of enthusiasm for a job even moderately well-done. Sorry were not grading on a curve here. The script by any standard has a satisfying snap and some nicely drawn secondary characters among them the blue-collar brother and sister who take a shine to Ann and George in Pittsburgh. Chief among the movies charms are Ms. Zellweger Mr. Rendall--whose would-be actor Robbie is a dab hand at embroidery and accessorizing his stepmother--and Mr. Lerman who plays George as a bookish adolescent with dreams of becoming a writer. ""Theres so much sun in L.A."" Ann tells her son in one of the movies blessedly few winks. ""Get yourself some color George."" Clearly mother knew best. Art amp; Copy Children see 20000 ads every year. In 2008 food companies spent 32 billion pushing their products. These are but a few of the statistics that pop up on screen during ""Art amp; Copy"" a scattershot repetitive documentary about the creative minds behind some of the most arresting ad campaigns of the past 40 years Nikes ""Just Do It"" ""Wheres the Beef?"" for Wendys Clairols ""It Lets Me Be Me."" As I listened to industry giants such as Dan Wieden and David Kennedy Lee Clow George Lois and Hal Riney ruminate about the impact of their work I kept wondering what Don Draper would think. Draper the brooding antihero of ""Mad Men"" the hit television series set in the ad world of the early 1960s would probably raise his eyebrows smile cynically and reach for a bottle of scotch. For their part Messrs. Riney Clow et al. would probably call Draper a soulless and none-too-inventive dream peddler. Im on Dons side. Its fun to see some of the ground-breaking print ads for Volkswagen and to hear the wonderfully irreverent advertising veteran George Lois talk about the campaign that launched the career of clothing designer Tommy Hilfiger. Its interesting to learn that the legendary agency Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB) was the first to have artists and copywriters work as a team rather than as separate entities. But there arent enough such nuggets. There are however plenty of self-congratulations. The ad men interviewed here revel in their status as outsiders and renegades (and except for former agency head Mary Wells and Phyllis K. Robinson the first copy chief at DDB they are men--little has changed since the era of ""Mad Men""). They view uninspired ads as a moral failing and talk about the power of ads to give companies a sense of themselves. ""Were trying to tell them they can be more"" says one agency head. It all sounds rather grandiose but its hardly a surprising view from folks accustomed to thinking big. Post Grad Primed and programmed for success Ryden Malby (Alexis Bledel) is thrown for a loop when she loses out on her dream job to a longtime rival in the summa cum lazy comedy ""Post Grad."" With no paycheck and no prospects shes forced to move back home to the bosom of her family. The group includes her luggage-salesman dad (Michael Keaton) who unwittingly traffics in hot merchandise and has problems with a neighbors cat; her little brother who likes to lick peoples heads; and her death-obsessed grandma (Carol Burnett sinking low) who visits funeral homes to try out the caskets. We are meant to think they are all delightfully and amusingly eccentric. Actually theyre just creepy. But things arent all bad for Ryden; unemployed shes got loads of free time to spend with the cute guy who lives just across the street. ""Post Grad"" delivers a murky message about love work family and Eskimo Pies. DVD Focus Chicago (2002) Welcome to the Windy City of the Prohibition era where the gin is cold and the pianos hot. Renee Zellweger is ruthless vaudevillian wannabe Roxie Hart (dont be a chump and fall for her naive act or the kewpie-doll cuteness) whos on trial for murdering her boyfriend in the dazzling Oscar-winning musical. The heat-seeking fame-seeking Roxie would like it understood that shes the true victim. Tell it to the jury? Shed rather tell it to the world. But shes got stiff competition--in the glorious form of fellow jailbird Catherine Zeta-Jones--for the short attention span of the public and the press. Pulp Fiction (1994) John Travoltas career was on life support before the adrenaline shot of the extraordinary ""Pulp Fiction."" Nevermind that hes killed off halfway through Quentin Tarantinos self-reflexive postmodern black comedy of thugs and lugs kingpins and common criminals rampage and redemption. This is a trio of vignettes full of smart talk and framed by two scenes in a coffee-shop feature. It includes in no particular order a pair of mob hit men (Mr. Travolta and a Bible-spouting Samuel L. Jackson) a mysterious briefcase a gangsters wife a boxer and a sanitation expert with an unusual and exceedingly useful specialty. Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948) Advertising executive Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two adolescent daughters are crammed into a New York City apartment with insufficient closets and bathrooms in this winsome comedy made a year after Grant and Loy were teamed in ""The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer."" An ad for a Connecticut house on three-dozen acres (plus or minus) looks like a solution to the familys problem. But the problems are only beginning. Blandings does battle with his lawyer and best friend (the wonderfully sardonic Melvyn Douglas) the architect contractor and all those who would try to take advantage of a city slicker.

This StoryMOVIES Tarantino with a VengeanceDiscuss Is Tarantino a Genius or a Hack?MovieMakers Working Both Sides of the CameraInglourious BasterdsFind Inglourious Basterds Showtimes TicketsView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story An acknowledged cinema geek whose early years were spent in blissful self-education in the motifs of B-movies noir pulp and the generic gestures of spaghetti westerns and 1970s exploitation flicks he went on to create films that stole from the best and sometimes worst that Hollywood had to offer. Like a delirious and sometimes demented magpie Tarantino feathered his movies with the detritus of pop culture creating visceral glibly funny pastiches (""Reservoir Dogs"" ""Pulp Fiction"") and once in a while even delivering stories about recognizable human beings (""Jackie Brown""). With the eagerly anticipated ""Inglourious Basterds"" Tarantino manages to simultaneously surprise and revert to predictable form. The surprise lies in his choice of period and subject matter. Set in France during World War II ""Inglourious Basterds"" tells the fictional story of a special squad of American Jews whose mission to kill and capture German soldiers was uniquely practical and symbolic. But as rich as the subject matter is in both action and metaphor in Tarantinos hands it becomes mere scaffolding for his chief preoccupation which is the movies. From the admittedly breathtaking opening sequence which in its meticulous staging pacing and acting pays loving homage to the work of Sergio Leone to the Grand Guignol of a climax set in a Paris cinema ""Inglourious Basterds"" isnt about history or war or people and their problems or anything of substance or meaning. Its a movie about other movies. For all its visual bravura and occasional bursts of antic inspiration it feels trivial the work of a kid who cant stop grabbing his favorite shiny plaything. To the degree that viewers share Tarantinos obsessions -- with cinema music and bloody ritualized violence -- they will enjoy ""Inglourious Basterds"" which undoubtedly possesses its share of grace notes. Finest by far is the German actor Christoph Waltz who in a revelatory performance plays the German colonel and legendary ""Jew hunter"" Hans Landa. Waltz appears in that fabulous opening sequence confronting a French dairy farmer whom he suspects of harboring a fugitive Jewish family. As he drinks a glass of the farmers fresh milk Waltzs Landa takes his place among the pantheon of great film villains the personification of smiling evil and playful menacing politesse. That first scene turns out to presage much of what is to follow in ""Inglourious Basterds"" whose structure pretty much comes down to scenes of people talking followed by paroxysms of brutal violence (although it must be said that Tarantino shows admirable restraint in the first outburst). Whats more it ends with the movies most problematic stumper a gesture that is completely out of keeping for a chief character but without which the movie would have nowhere to go. Landa is by far the strongest character in ""Inglourious Basterds"" which stars Brad Pitt as his American counterpart Lt. Aldo Raine who early in the movie is shown assembling a group of Jewish soldiers whose mission is ""one thing and one thing only killin Nazis."" Only in Pitts attempt at Smoky Mountain vernacular that last line comes out sounding like ""one thang and one thang only killin Nattzies."" Mustached and flinty-eyed Pitts character ends his speech by announcing that hes part Apache and as such will insist that each of his men owes him ""one hunnert Nattzie scalps."" (The deliberate misspellings of the title presumably are meant to simultaneously pay homage to and make a crucial distinction from the 1978 Italian war movie ""The Inglorious Bastards."") Because its Tarantino viewers can rest assured that well see those scalps being taken. And well see a character called ""the Bear Jew"" -- played in one of several instances of stunt casting by pulp horror director Eli Roth -- beating a German soldier to death with a baseball bat. In an attempt to go ""The Dirty Dozen"" one dirtier Tarantino piles on yet another macabre flourish in the form of a swastika that Raine carves into the foreheads of the Germans he doesnt kill. Doling out such graphic sequences like so many dog biscuits Tarantino clearly has sought to reward the ""Kill Bill"" crowd who just cant get enough of guts gore and torture. In a second plot line the beautiful owner of a Paris movie theater (played by MA(c)lanie Laurent) begins her own plot against the Nattzies one that hinges on the premiere of a propaganda film featuring the German version of Audie Murphy and the flammable properties of old-fashioned nitrate film stock. Busy busy busy. And it gets even more frenetic when the Basterds conspire in a plot against Third Reich bigwigs with a gorgeous German double agent (and actress) played by Diane Kruger channeling Marlene Dietrich and a dashing unflappable British officer (and film critic) played by the terrific Irish actor Michael Fassbender channeling Trevor Howard. With name-checks of Leni Riefenstahl G.W. Pabst and the movie studio UFA dropped like so many bundled incendiaries ""Inglourious Basterds"" often feels like a windy tutorial in prewar German cinema history broken up by the odd firefight or brutal murder. Mashing up visual styles and musical eras with blithe anachronistic license Tarantino at one point stages a scene to resemble ""The Lady From Shanghai"" by way of a dime-store pulp novel set to David Bowies ""Cat People (Putting Out Fire)."" If only the Allies had had Tarantino on their side; he could have made Hitlers head explode. As it happens they must instead settle on having their actions and exploits extruded through his own bizarre sense of cruelty spectacle and talky postmodern irony. (Characters are routinely introduced by way of cheesy 70s-era screen titles.) In his defense Tarantino announces right off the bat that ""Inglourious Basterds"" is little more than a fairy tale in a title that reads ""Once upon a time in . . . Nazi-Occupied France."" Still even with the most elaborately embroidered myth it helps to believe at least one word of it. Its interesting that ""Inglourious Basterds"" follows two other movies that have spun their own tales of comeuppance and macho Jewish heroism last years ""Valkyrie"" which turned real-life attempts to assassinate Hitler into a sleek ""Mission Impossible""-like thriller and ""Defiance"" which received high marks from historians for getting the story right about real-life Jewish partisans who bravely fought back. Compared with those relatively sober films ""Inglourious Basterds"" unspools less like bold revisionism than a lurid wish fulfillment fantasy of revenge cinephilia and carnage. Tarantino isnt interested in telling an authentic or believable story in ""Inglourious Basterds"" so much as using World War II as a backdrop for his ongoing enterprise of cinematic recycling. Hes managed to feather yet another one of his nests which at this point are feeling all the more flimsy for being overstuffed. Inglourious Basterds (151 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong graphic violence profanity and brief sexuality.

The Basterds soon cross paths with a French-Jewish teenage girl who runs a movie theater in Paris which is targeted by the soldiers. Genre Drama WarDirector Quentin TarantinoCast Brad Pitt Melanie Laurent Christoph Waltz Apparently some critics are upset at Quentin Tarantino for creating a revenge-fantasy parallel-universe World War II movie in which a team of Jewish bounty hunters scalp Nazis history is rewritten at every turn and Brad Pitt talks like the offspring of Forrest Gump and a Monty Python character. Guess we should also condemn ""The Blues Brothers"" for the gratuitous use of ""Illinois Nazis"" and of course Indiana Jones and ""The Dirty Dozen"" and... Or we could recognize a big-ass drive-in movie for what it is. Offensive? Really? As if audiences arent smart enough to discern that ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a cinematic mash-up in which Tarantino samples everything from the spaghetti Western to the film noirs of the 1940s to movies like ""The Dirty Dozen."" Hes not engaging in Holocaust denial or exploiting history; hes giving us a great B-movie that careens wildly from style to style but is always always letting us in on the experience. Here is a movie Tarantino tells us from the opening scene which is the best opening scene in any film of 2009. It is not to be taken seriously at any turn. Enjoy the ride. The ""Basterds"" of the title are a team of bloodthirsty Jewish soldiers led by Brad Pitts (decidedly non-Jewish) twangy-voiced goofy-mustached Lt. Aldo Raine. (A nod to old-time character actor Aldo Ray who was in a number of war pictures.) They are not interested in capturing German soldiers; they are interested in hunt-and-execution but only after inflicting as much pain as possible on their prey as they extricate information about the location of other Nazis. Pitt delivers a robust and hilarious performance---but the Basterds arent even the most intriguing characters Tarantino has assembled in yet another one of his brilliant deeply layered screenplays in which multiple storylines play out at a leisurely pace before intersecting in ingenious and of course bloody fashion. In the opening scene we meet the Nazi officer Hans Landa who takes pride in his nickname ""Jew Hunter."" Austrian actor Christoph Waltz (Best Actor winner at Cannes) gives the supporting performance of the year and one of the most memorable performances of the decade as Landa a Satanic figure with a silky smooth veneer. Landa sits across the table from a French farmer downing the farmers milk lighting up his pipe and affecting a friendly tone as he verbally vivisects the poor man into divulging information about a Jewish family thats been in hiding for months. It is a masterful scene with the tension escalating like a drip...drip...dripping faucet that cannot be silenced. If those opening minutes were released as a self-contained story it would be worthy of an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. But Tarantino is just getting warmed up. In addition to meeting Aldo Raine and his team of vigilantes (including director Eli Roth in a terrific turn as a killer known as the ""Bear Jew"" who revels in beating his victims to death with a baseball bat) we see Hitler and Goebbels as cartoonishly grotesque parodies (and why not?); Michael Fassbender as a British commando who also happens to be a film critic (CQ); and Diane Kruger as a famous and beloved actress working as a double agent. Most and best of all theres the luminous Melanie Laurent as Shoshanna who narrowly escaped Landas clutches a few years earlier and is seen a few years later running a cinema in German-occupied Paris. A German war hero tries to court her (shes repulsed) by convincing Goebbels they should premiere the fictional version of the war heros story at Shoshannas movie house. When Hitler himself decides hell attend the premiere Shoshanna and Aldo launch separate and equally insane schemes to turn that premiere into a night the Nazis will never forget---that is if any of them survive. Thats the meat-and-potatoes of ""Inglourious Basterds."" Theres no shortage of quality kills and over-the-top violence---but as is always the case with Tarantino the real exhilaration comes from extended sequences peppered with funny smart surprising exchanges followed by bursts of violence. At one point Krugers Bridget sets up a meet with a team of Allied agents masquerading as German officers in a cellar bar populated by real German soldiers who are getting drunk as well as a keen-eared Nazi officer who is lurking around the corner picking up that something aint right in the bar. Its a World War II version of the scene in ""True Romance"" when everybody winds up in the same room and things are light and casual for a while---and then not so much. What a great piece of filmmaking. My only disappointment with ""Inglourious Basterds"" comes with the final act which is set up so beautifully but doesnt quite fire on every cylinder. Shoshannas revenge plan isnt as clever as youd expect it to be and a few characters exit the movie in less than satisfying fashion. As for the pure-evil Hans Landa he has some amazing moments near the end but I would have liked to see---well I dont want to give anything away. After the movies been out for a while Ill return to Landas fate. For more than a few critics and cinephiles Quentin Tarantino will always be held against the Quentin Tarantino who revolutionized movies with ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" just as M. Night Shyamalan will never live down the expectations created by ""The Sixth Sense."" Both directors would probably admit they might have enjoyed the hype and the fame a bit too much and that may have rubbed some people the wrong way. And maybe neither will ever match the greatness of the movies that turned them into icons. Fine ""Inglourious Basterds"" isnt as good as ""Pulp Fiction."" Neither are 99.9 percent of films that have come out in the last 15 years. Its still one of the best movies of 2009. (12) Post a Comment  Trenton Muellersaid on Thursday September 09 2010 100740 PMPerhaps it is my immaturity that leads me to my personal thoughts that the movie fell completely flat. For two hours I was waiting for the funny quirky hilarious scenes that I had read and heard about from reviewers internet solicitors and friends. For the last one hour of the movie I had contemplated whether or not the cinema had accidentally screened the wrong movie but quickly deducted otherwise. I am surprised that it has been received so well by the general public but I didnt enjoy the gruesome scenes in which I cringed nor the serious acting I hadnt watched the movie for. A very contradicting film to me and wont make it into even my top 50 movies. Mikesaid on Monday August 23 2010 53647 PMA Hollywood movie with Nazi Germans trying to outdo Hollywood Jews at making Hollywood movies. There is just something too poetic about that. Angelsaid on Friday March 05 2010 25940 PMI know this movie has been given rave reviews but I was not impressed. True to Tarantino style this movie had violence for the sake of violence. Swearing just to swear. Few lines were delivered without an unneccessary amount of profanity thrown in to no doubt shock...only after the one millionth f word..you were numb to it all. I regret the time money and wasted ""date night"" that was spent on this movie. Steve Horlicksaid on Monday February 01 2010 121013 AMI know its not likely to happen but just imagine the quirky possibilities in a sequel. Sarasaid on Saturday January 30 2010 33056 PMThis was one of the best movies from 2009. It was funny and tense and comical and brutally violent. The best opening scene of any movie Ive ever seen. The tension was so palpable I couldnt look away for even a second. kodysaid on Tuesday January 19 2010 30725 PMthe movie was awsome tarantino did it again JRMsaid on Sunday January 17 2010 43538 AMI absolutely loved this movie and I agree with every word in your review. drewsaid on Saturday January 16 2010 73231 PMI do not see why everyone loves this movie so much. Regretted watching the entire thing. What a let down Tarantino continues to be more of a cliche of himself with every movie he makes. Hanz was the only good character but even then he was such a characature of a bad guy that he failed to seem evil. Movie was also full of bland dialogue that a second grader might mistake for being witty and ""fluff"" scenes that add nothing to the film... one example comes immediately to mind Shoshanna getting dressed and putting her lipstick on to music..... just leaves the impression of a director trying way to hard to be ""sexy"" or ""artistic""... fails miserably. If you want a good WWII movie along these lines watch Defiance. One last note the opening sequence was pretty good...the rest of the movie is not worth watching. jacksaid on Monday December 28 2009 35528 PMI was a little disapointed with Diane Krugars exit in the film although a very good scene but I thought her character was very under used and her performance was very strong in the scenes she was in. Christoph Waltz deserves a Best Supporting Actor Nomination for his unbelievable work here. junierizzlesaid on Tuesday December 22 2009 92748 PMI diagree with you about the final act. I LOVED IT. SOshanas exit was amazing. Beatifually shot Qt picked the perfect piece of music for that scene. Even though the entire movie was clearly not a historical documentation I was not expecting what happened at all. My only complain is that I wouldve have liked to see more of the BASTERDS. But QT gave me someting so unexpected and great that it didnt matter that there wasnt more of the BASTERDS.

All true. Tarantinos seventh full-length film recasts the iconography and mythic cruelties of Sergio Leones Westerns as the stuff of World War II history--not the history we know but an alternate-reality version in which Adolf Hitler exits pursued by a machine-gunning character known as ""the Bear Jew."" The result is a Jewish ""Death Wish"" to borrow Pauline Kaels description of ""Marathon Man"" amped up to epoch-changing proportions made by a gentile writer-director with an unlimited appetite for celluloid right down to its highly flammable properties. I dont know if Ive ever seen a revenge fantasy so willfully messed up sometimes offensively so that still manages to be worthwhile for whole sections of its 21/2 hours. The opening is as good a sequence as Tarantino has ever created and that includes the best bits in ""Pulp Fiction"" ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Death Proof"" (my three favorites of his to date). The year is 1941 ""once upon a time ... in Nazi-occupied France"" the title card informs us in the first of several hundred Leone lifts. A provincial French dairy farmer and his daughters are visited one day by Col. Landa (Waltz) who suspects the farmer of hiding Jewish neighbors on his property. This being a Tarantino film the stalker in effect filibusters his prey praising the farmers fresh milk the beauty of his daughters. Like so many in Tarantinos work the scene relies on a methodical buildup some self-conscious and peculiarly funny details strewn along the sidewinding conversational path--and then murderous violence. Visually the premise is straight out of ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly."" The approaching Nazis could well be the Old West sociopaths of a Leone landscape. Yet in the prologue Tarantino absorbs his visual influences sparingly. The menace emerges from the silences between the words exchanged warily between Waltzs Landa and Denis Menochets farmer both exceptional. ""Inglourious Basterds"" takes its title (and little else) from the pulpy 1978 Enzo Castellari World War II programmer. By the midpoint weve been introduced to the ""bushwhackin guerrilla army"" set up by ""Aldo the Apache"" Raine a one-dimensional character played in the appropriate number of dimensions by a comically jaw-jutted Brad Pitt. His squadron of eight Jewish-American soldiers has orders to scalp 100 dead Nazis apiece. They do so with relish--theyre basically as cold-blooded as the Nazis theyre after only righteously so--and Raine brings the same relish to the job of carving swastikas into the foreheads of surviving Nazi prisoners. If this sounds like something out of say ""Hostel"" then perhaps this is why ""Hostel"" director and Tarantino crony Eli Roth (who cant act worth a damn) has been cast as the baseball-bat-wielding Donny Donowitz whose mythic reputation has been giving Hitler (Martin Wuttke) panic attacks and the Third Reich something to worry about. So is this a ""Dirty Dozen""-style mission movie the mission being the elimination of Hitler and the end of the war? Not really. ""Inglourious Basterds"" has more to do with cinephilia than combat and its heart belongs to a young woman featured in the opening sequence. Melanie Laurent portrays Shosanna who--jumping ahead to 1944 in Paris--has assumed a new non-Jewish identity and runs a cinematheque with her projectionist lover (Jacky Ido). The Nazis are to take over the theater for the premiere of their latest propaganda effort a war film called ""Nations Pride."" Every image every conversation in ""Inglourious Basterds"" constitutes a hyperlink to another earlier film. A Nazi sharpshooter debates the merits of silent star Max Linder versus Charlie Chaplin. A British spy (Michael Fassbender) has a background as a film critic. A Dietrich-esque German screen siren (Diane Kruger) becomes a crucial player in the films other standout sequence in which Fassbenders critic-turned-spy posing as a German officer tests his linguistic skills against the skepticism of a cadre of Nazis in a basement-level French tavern. Surrounded by a fair amount of sadism--most of it played for cheap lingering thrills such as Pitt poking his finger inside Krugers gaping bullet wound--the tavern melee comes at you hard and fast. Death means something here if only because it happens so suddenly. Tarantinos World War II universe (more artificial and hermetic than the ""Kill Bill"" movies even) has no interest in realism or conventional action. But the more the writer-director dives into cuckooland especially at the climax the less it all matters and the more galling the whole jape becomes. Half the time were watching human beings caught up in a war and a genocide that Tarantino sees to it we recognize if only from B-movies made in Hollywood during the war; the other half goofs around with daydreams of rewriting WWII history in crimson and arc lights. Top-billed Pitt plays Tarantinos idea of a cartoon tough guy--Aldo Ray Lee Marvin and a few other stray dogs put together. Waltz by contrast transcends the facetiousness and very nearly makes this farrago worth seeing. Landas heinous charm is his most threatening weapon and the actor glides in and out of three languages German French and English with insidious ease. Hes awfully good. So is Laurent; so are Fassbender and Kruger. These actors pull you in. Tarantinos use of the Ennio Morricone music or the Giorgio Moroder ""Cat People"" theme () or the footnote-style Samuel L. Jackson voice-over narration yanks you straight out again. The movie hasnt changed much since its premiere earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival beyond the addition of some valuable footage featuring Fassbender and Pitt setting up the tavern scene. As always but here more than ever Tarantino goes for the buffet approach. Here a little Leone; there a little Ernst Lubitsch. Here a little Fritz Lang ""Man Hunt"" (the fascinating 1941 novelty which opens with Walter Pidgeon aiming his rifle at Hitlers heart); there somewhere amid the layers of all the brutal kitsch and artifice a little Quentin Tarantino.

Italian. Posted by wrlord | December 03 2009 at 0152 AM Well Im not a huge fan of Tarantino despite seeing many of his movies. I loved Reservoir Dogs - fantastic movie. Kill Bill Death Proof and Grind House were ridiculous and idiotic yet very watchable entertaining and amusing. Pulp Fiction Four Rooms and Jackie Brown make me fall asleep I think theyre plain boring. Inglorious Basterds? Awesome movie. I liked it right up there with Reservoir Dogs. Posted by Abe | November 22 2009 at 0642 PM I enjoyed this movie experience it moves along. I agree that the narrator is jarring and the western theme music is annoying but what a concept My heart was pounding I was nervous and anxious watching and can you say that about many movies? Even though the whole scheme in the french movie theatre is unrealstic I was going with it except for one aspect. Wouldnt the Nazis have had plenty of guards stationed in and out - so how can Marcel walk out with the metals bars without being spotted the two basterds able to get up to Hitlers two guards. You see what Im sayin? Posted by Frankie | September 10 2009 at 0106 AM Im a fan of Tarantino amp; liked all his movies up to this one but Ive gotta say I was dissapionted. I agree with Adam the characters were kinda weak I really didnt care about any of them. If it wasnt for the basement bar scene this movie would be a wash. I guess Nazi skinheads will like it. Posted by Cat | September 02 2009 at 0214 AM If a hack like you can get a job reviewing movies which line do I have to get in? Is the shotgun lobotomy a must or a technicality? I positively loved this film even the pretensious final line where Tarentino implies he has created his ""masterpeice"". It is all around brilliant and did not even feel as long as it actually was in fact it was so enjoyable I craved more. I expected more scenes of the basterds doing what they did best killin Nazis but there wasnt. Just like Reservoir Dogs some things are implied and left to the imagination. If people want to nit-pick the non-historical take of a fictional film what are they doing at the movies? Arent you late for your shuffle board game? Or is that after your latte enema? This a great film with plenty of WTF moments that doesnt take it self too seriously and shouldnt be especialy by any film snobs. If your a fan of Tarentino films this is one of his best. Any one who says otherwise never really did like his style and was just hopping on the band wagon. Posted by ACP | September 01 2009 at 1023 PM Just wanted to talk to you about Tarantinos new film. I just got done seeing it for a second time and I love the film. I was surprised to read your somewhat negative review. I disagree (respectfully of course) that the film is a showcase for Waltz. I think that Waltz has the most interesting character in the film but in terms of screen time this is truly an ensemble piece. Just because Waltzs performance is the best and most memorable that doesnt necessarily mean Tarantino was using it as a showcase in my opinion. Other than that I agree with a lot of your points but the film just worked for me. To be honest I think it is the best movie Ive seen all year. In fact it is my favorite Tarantino film ever. I liked it even more than Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. I thought he created some of his most memorable characters and I actually believed that he weaved the story together perfectly. I thought this film actually had a great story while Pulp Fiction didnt really have any kind of plot. Anyway...just wanted to weigh in with my thoughts. Keep up the good work sir. Posted by Danny King | August 31 2009 at 0938 AM Thanks for the line "" This being a Tarantino film the stalker in effect filibusters his prey..."". Wish Id have said that. Tarantino makes movies like Emeril cooks if a little is too much more is better. I always feel like I can hear him talking through his characters particularly in those galling one on one dialogue encounters that between a knowing Bogart and a jaded Greenstreet work but between Tarantino and Tarantino through his proxies sound contrived and ludicrous. Posted by D.Caplan | August 31 2009 at 0124 AM Its not a remake. Posted by um | August 30 2009 at 0221 AM Kill Bill was a waste of time for me i did walk out and i should have walk out of Inglourious Basterds too. Some parts were funny others were just graphic violence. Posted by sr | August 30 2009 at 0136 AM I really loved this film and I would encourage everyone to give it a chance in theaters. I think it is the best film of 2009 so far. Posted by Danny K. | August 30 2009 at 1218 AM This was a great film with a great performance by Mr. Waltz. Your picky criticisms years later will look loopy when this film will go down in history as one of Tarentinos finest achievements. If giving of stars are not considered relative you consider the awful Post Grad superior to this film. I think you have seriously diminished your credibility as a film critic in recent weeks. Posted by Robert Pruter | August 29 2009 at 0734 PM John S Youre a fool. ""I say ""Poorly Done"" to any reviewer who doesnt trash this movie."" Oh Im sorry. Does somebody disagree with YOUR opinion of a movie? Get over it. The same thing happened for me with Watchmen. Nobody walked out of my theater when I went to see it and everyone gave it a standing ovation. My friends go and see it and everyone hates it or walks out. Dont pretend like you speak for everyone when it comes to what makes a movie good or not. I too went to see this mainly because it was branded with the Tarantino name and being generally favorable to all of his films I had very high expectations when entering the theater. Not being mislead by the trailers I can safely say that I and my friends as well left with our expectations not only filled but eager for more. I say go see it. Posted by Maverickx104 | August 26 2009 at 1118 AM People film critics arent here to tell you whether or not you will (or should) like a film. People who read reviews for that purpose would be better served just going to see the freakin movie. A film critics job is to evaluate the movies success as a work of art. Dont like Picasso? Dont buy one. Posted by JP | August 24 2009 at 0345 PM I just got back from watching the film and I was really disappointed. I didnt care about the characters the dialog was masturbation in word form and the violence was not even worth mentioning. Probably QTs weakest movie so far. Gutted. Posted by Adam Chamberlain | August 23 2009 at 1054 PM This guy has no credability if he thinks death proof is better than reservoir dogs Posted by rob | August 22 2009 at 0942 PM So is there an actual plot here or is it like most Tarantino films with not much plot but more about atmosphere cartoon characters and over-the-top violence. Posted by lhastings | August 22 2009 at 0255 PM KXB Funny I loved Kill Bill 1 amp; 2 and it prompted me to watch some of the movies that inspired parts of it Battle Royale Lady Snowblood the Lone Wolf amp; Cub series many others. Is Tarantino ""great""? Maybe maybe not; Im not a film critic so I cant judge effectively. Do I consistently enjoy his films? Yes. (A related question do I enjoy Michael Bay films? NO.) Tarantino delivers what Im looking for in escapist entertainment so it works for me. Posted by SRM-LRM | August 22 2009 at 0814 AM Land spoke italian as well.. not to get too nit picky. but. This was a great movie. Equal to Pulp Fiction. but completely Different. To me... i want a movie i have not seen before. This is that. Crappy review. Its a must see movie for people who like good movies. Period. Posted by Kent j | August 22 2009 at 0717 AM Anything above a one star rating is ludicrous. I just finished watching it and I dont know if I am more disappointed with the movie or the reviewers. I say ""Poorly Done"" to any reviewer who doesnt trash this movie. Get over the names Pitt and Tarentino and stop encouraging people to waste their time. I saw 10 people walk out during the movie and never return and I watched the movie with five people all of whom despised the movie (and bear in mind we went to see the movie because of Tarentinos name). Posted by John S | August 22 2009 at 0142 AM great movie. you movie snobs are too busy trying to impress one another with your critiques. entertainment galore. Posted by notamo viesnob | August 22 2009 at 1223 AM Download this one people. Fight the power Posted by burningrabbit | August 21 2009 at 1034 AM will see it and judge for myself... Posted by Stephen A. | August 21 2009 at 0216 AM Tim C Do you know what the word ""histrionic"" means? That aside I might agree with you. But I am not interested in graphic violence masquerading as ""entertainment"". Enjoy the movie ... sounds like you will. Posted by RC Hackett | August 20 2009 at 0829 PM 2.5 stars is generous in my opinion. Nothing hes directed is worth a damn. Posted by Ray Merriam | August 20 2009 at 0635 PM Mr. Phillips and many other critics get so caught up in demonstrating their knowledge of film histrionics and genre and being able to apply that knowledge to what theyre reviewing that they lose touch with the reason most movie goers pay for a ticket; entertainment Will the movie I just paid almost a sawbuck to see hold my interest and entertain me through its entire length? In the case of Tarantinos movies the answer to that question is usually an unequivocal ""yes"". After I and others have the chance to see Inglrious Basterds Im fairly confident Ill walk out thinking ""what the heck was Phillips watching when he gave this movie 2 1/2 stars?

Aldo Raine of the ""basterds"" Jewish-American soldiers getting revenge on the Nazis. ABOUT THE MOVIEInglourious Basterds   1/2 (out of four)Stars Christoph Waltz Brad Pitt Diane Kruger Daniel Brhl Mlanie Laurent Eli Roth B.J. NovakDirector Quentin TarantinoDistributor The Weinstein CompanyRating R for strong graphic violence language and brief sexualityRunning time 2 hours 32 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE VIDEO By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Pure exhilaration is in woefully short supply at the movies. But within one week two films offer a bracing dose of this rare commodity first District 9 the most inventive sci-fi action film of the summer and now the invigorating Inglourious Basterds. Within the first frames of writer/director Quentin Tarantinos audacious dismantling of history you may feel as if you took a hit of pure oxygen. His tall tale with its tense and jangly pacing is immediately riveting. Loosely based on Enzo Castellaris 1978 film Basterds is brash nimbly acted and and not surprisingly for a Tarantino movie incessantly violent. But with its wartime setting what bloody mayhem there is feels integral and for the most part appropriate. This wish-fulfillment fantasy baldly reinvents history beginning in 1941 in the Nazi-occupied French countryside. Nazi Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) bursts into a farmhouse oozing malevolence and savage grace. He smugly toys with a taciturn farmer like a menacing cat batting at a mouse he could devour at will. But hes after something bigger a Jewish family in hiding. Landa is one of the most spellbindingly despicable characters written for the screen. His cruelty barely disguised by a patina of charm Landa is portrayed brilliantly by Waltz. Come Oscar time expect to see the Austrian-born actor on the short list. Teenage Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) survives Landas vicious execution of her family and tears off. With her desperate flight the film surges into powerful stomach-churning overdrive. Several years later now the owner of a small cinema in Paris Shosanna plots against the Nazis her vendetta following a parallel course to that of the ""basterds"" a corps of Jewish-American soldiers bent on exacting quick and painful vengeance on all Nazis who cross their path. Brad Pitt anchors the standout cast as good ol boy Lt. Aldo Raine the head basterd. Raine and his men concoct a daring scheme to eliminate key members of the Third Reich assisted by a duplicitous German actress (Diane Kruger). Tarantino avoids some of the linguistic contortions that often arise in war films. In American movies Nazis speak English with either gruff German intonations or arch British accents. But Tarantino deals with the problem more directly. For example Landa speaks French to the farmer -- we get subtitles -- then asks if he can switch to English because he has exhausted his French. The exchange works seamlessly. The madness could have been dialed down in the drawn-out grisly climax. But Tarantino is renowned for being a cinephile as well as a filmmaker. And in Basterds-- with its focus on Shosannas theater and a violent film-within-a-film that figures prominently in the climax -- he exercises both his obsession with vengeance and his fascination with the movies. The outcome is gory and glorious. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + If the title werent already taken itd be tempting to think of Quentin Tarantinos new movie - indeed his entire career - as ""Infinite Jest. Inside the fevered junk-pop particle accelerator that is this directors brain moments of power and banality meaning and absurdity all collide into each other creating movie mash-ups as brilliant as they are pointless. You take a Tarantino film seriously at your risk which is why ""Inglourious Basterds is his greatest risk yet a rollicking action-comedy about - wait for it - the Holocaust.This isnt new ground really. As with any historical calamity the urge to view it from all sides - including farce - grows with time and World War II has been mined for shock-comedy since at least ""The Producers in 1968. Theres a tiny germ of an idea in ""Basterds and its the same one that propelled last years ""Defiance How about a movie where the Jews fight back?Where ""Defiance was a dramatic slog hamstrung by its faithfulness to history though ""Inglourious Basterds is just the opposite a manically playful revenge fantasia made from the spare parts of Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns and strapping World War II action flicks like ""The Great Escape and Enzo Castellaris 1978 ""The Inglorious Bastards from which Tarantino has mangled his title and much of his plot.Does it work? On a scene-by-scene basis ""Inglourious Basterds is prime if well-worn Tarantino - the hard-boiled men and women the tense smart dialogue scenes that go on forever the spurts of violence that erupt to wipe the board clean so the cycle can start again. Yet its also his weakest film yet in part because the directors playing close to the fire this time and hes scared of getting burnt.The nominal star is Brad Pitt as Lieutenant Aldo Raine leader of the Basterds a (mostly) American squadron of Jewish GIs in occupied France whose mandate is to kill scalp and sow terror into as many Nazis as possible. Pitts doing one of his comic character turns here - he plays Raine as a macho hillbilly who wouldnt be out of place in a Coen brothers movie. Its fair to say though that ""Inglourious Basterds is stolen fair and square by the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa of the SS the Jews worst enemy in France.Waltz is a slender actor with a long playful face - he makes Landa a lethal imp whose one flaw is his ego. He gives an almost obscenely delightful performance The colonel has vowed to capture the Basterds but he keeps getting sidetracked by the immense pleasure of watching himself do so. Hes the star of his own movie. Thats not an idle metaphor As youd expect from a cinema-besotted former video store clerk ""Inglourious Basterds is more about the movies made during World War II than about the war itself. Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) a young Jewish woman who has escaped Landas clutches in the opening sequence later turns up running a movie house in Paris; shes wooed by Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) a Nazi war hero whom Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) has cast in a film based on Zollers exploits. Among the Basterds contacts is a German film star/double agent played by Diane Kruger on loan from the ""National Treasure movies.All this ensures the characters will argue the merits of Leni Riefenstahls 1929 ""The White Hell of Pitz Palu in long arch arias of dialogue; that old Ennio Morricone film scores will be merrily repurposed; that obscure movie references will be buried throughout awaiting future dissection by legions of cinema studies grad students. As with any Tarantino movie ""Basterds ultimately just reflects its makers magpie affectations. Why is David Bowies ""Cat People title song trotted out here - not once but twice? Because QT likes it thats why.The hyperactivity makes the movie bearable while keeping it from connecting. ""Inglourious Basterds is divided into five chapters some of which could serve as stand-alone shorts A prolonged outrageously suspenseful showdown in a basement bier-garten may be the films high point. Eventually the players converge on Shosannas little theater where Zollers movie will premiere to an audience of Nazi brass including Hitler himself (Martin Wuttke). (If its historical accuracy youre seeking boy are you at the wrong movie.) An explosive reception is planned and ""Basterds dutifully detonates in style.Yet you come away amused and unmoved and that wasnt the case with say ""Kill Bill where by the end Uma Thurman had assumed an exhausted hard-won majesty. For the first time in a Tarantino movie the womens roles feel underwritten and most of the men dont get enough screen time. Til Schweiger is briefly wonderful as a hulking ex-Nazi who has joined the Basterds - its the old James Coburn part from ""The Magnificent Seven - and Hollywood vet Rod Taylor (""The Birds) drops in as Winston Churchill. Theres even a deft Peter Sellers-like cameo by Mike Myers as a British officer - the best work the comedian has done in years.On the other hand Tarantino overindulges horror movie director-turned-actor Eli Roth as the most ferocious of the Basterds doing horrible things to a Boston accent only a kid from the western suburbs would dare. Next to Waltz the most enjoyable performance in ""Basterds comes from British actor Michael Fassbender as the drily capable Lieutenant Archie Hicox a key player in that beer hall scene. The movie cruelly hangs him out to dry though.Its obviously too much to expect a clever kid - which at 46 Tarantino still is - to grapple with history in any meaningful sense. For all that the movies pop-art shallowness feels forced. ""Inglorious Basterds is an entertainment but an uneasy one; it represents 153 minutes of bravura stalling after which its creator loses interest and walks away. Tarantino may be the most talented filmmaker in America who prides himself on having absolutely nothing to say.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

(Tony Fitts)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted August 21 2009Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds begins with an explosion of music and then the subtitle ""Once upon a time in . . . Nazi-occupied France."" And indeed Tarantinos misspelled World War II mash-up is very much a fairy tale a fantasy.But the ""once upon a time"" exists exclusively in one particular movie junkies head where the combat exploits of the Dirty Dozen combine with the madcap slapstick of Duck Soup where the hardboiled swagger of Sam Fuller meets the grisly gore of Eli Roth (the Hostel director stars as one of the Basterds) where comic shtick and over-writ jive reach a tsunami of camp excess.And then theres history which Tarantino raspberries with lunatic abandon. Suffice it to say that Adolf Hitler does not die in a bunker in April 1945. Tarantino has other plans for the fA1/4hrer.Like Kill Bill before it the writer/directors Inglourious Basterds is divided into chapters. The first set in Gallic cow country introduces Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) an SS officer with the sobriquet ""Jew Hunter."" He arrives at a farmhouse to root out a family of Jews he believes to be hiding there. There is plenty of patter between Landa and the farmer LaPadite (Denis Menochet) a considerable amount of it in French before the duo switch to English - for the edification of the audience yes but also to facilitate the discovery of the Jews (theyre within earshot but dont understand English).Eventually after pipe smoking and winking badinage a grim massacre ensues. But one of the daughters - the beautiful Shoshana (MA(c)lanie Laurent) - escapes. She will be heard from again.Cut to Chapter 2 and the introduction of the Basterds - a team of Army recruits under the command of Lt. Aldo Raine (sounds like Aldo Ray the actor who excelled in macho military roles). Brad Pitt plays the lieutenant with a jaunty mustache and a Tennessee twang. He cuts a formidable figure and he wants the eight soldiers six of them Jewish Americans to join him in cutting Nazis too. Hes being literal slicing the tops off the heads of the enemy ""Apache-style"" - 100 scalps per man.In this ""bushwhackin guerrilla army"" are Sgt. Donny Donowitz (Roth) who beats Nazis with a baseball bat and five other Hebrew schoolkids-turned-avengers (Omar Doom Michael Bacall B.J. Novak Paul Rust and Samm Levine). The Basterds also include a renegade Nazi and an Austrian expat.If Edward Zwicks Defiance offered a Jewish revenge story based on historical fact Tarantinos Basterds delivers its brand of Semitic payback based on spaghetti western caricature (with vintage Ennio Morricone music) over-the-top grindhouse violence and old copies of Sgt. Fury and Sgt. Rock comic books.Theres an interview with Tarantino in the September Atlantic in which the loquacious auteur gripes that Holocaust movies ""always have Jews as victims."" He goes on ""I want to see something different. Lets see Germans that are scared of the Jews. Lets not have everything build up to a big misery lets actually take the fun of action-movie cinema and apply it to this situation.""A fine plan if Tarantino had made a coherent action movie. But apart from a few flashback scenes of bloody retribution in the woods most of Inglourious Basterds takes place around tables in bars and boA(r)tes. There are parlor games endless arch dialogue each chapter building to a firefight (or some other sort of fire). Along the way Tarantino introduces a British officer (Michael Fassbender) schooled in German cinema a German film actress (Diane Kruger) working undercover for the Resistance a German film actor (Daniel BrA1/4hl) and a pile of 350 highly flammable nitrate prints. Leni Riefenstahl and David O. Selznick pop up in conversation and pretty much the whole finale (Chapter 5 ""Revenge of the Giant Face"") takes place in a Paris movie theater.In other words Inglourious Basterds - very loosely based on Enzo Castellaris 1978 war pic of the same (but correctly spelled) name - is less a Holocaust retribution fantasy than a messy homage to war movies and to movies period. Tonally schizoid and rife with anachronisms (a David Bowie song on the sound track out-of-era vernacular) Tarantinos Third Reich folly is utterly exasperating.Sure Pitts cartoony performance is amusing and Austrian actor Waltz brings a strutting pomposity to his role thats not without its malevolent charm. But Tarantino is like a kid playing soldiers - he cant stop himself and he tumbles into long scenarios at odds with the basic tenets of film narrative. He even resorts to labeling his characters with word-balloon-like scrawls just in case were having trouble keeping track of whos who in the chaos.And what did Tarantino have in mind with the films final exchange? Its between Pitts Lt. Aldo and Novaks Pvt. Utivich the two men sitting there as Aldo carves a swastika into a certain Nazis forehead.""You know somethin Utivich?"" says an appraising Pitt. ""I think this might just be my masterpiece.""If thats Tarantino talking hes delusional.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Inglourious Basterds is a film years in the making and hours in the watching but it seems designed to inspire mere minutes of reflection. Quentin Tarantinos long-discussed World War II movie--its been in the works in one form or another since Jackie Brown--features some thrilling action sequences in which Tarantinos gift for dialogue gets honed to a razor-dangerous edge and some seamlessly integrated reflections on cinemas role in shaping and reflecting history. But its moments of greatness--and there are more than a couple--feel weirdly disconnected stuck in a movie that doesnt know how to put them together or find a good way to move from one to the next. Set as the first of several chapter titles explains ""once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France"" Basterds pits the titular handful of Jewish-American soldiers and members of the French resistance against seemingly all of Nazi Germany. Brad Pitt leads the Basterds whose bloody guerilla tactics give them frightening near-legendary reputations. Even Hitler knows stories of the brutal baseball-bat-toting ""Bear Jew"" (Eli Roth) and the somewhat less frighteningly named ""Little Man"" (B.J. Novak). Elsewhere a Jewish woman (Melanie Laurent) hides out in Paris and manages a movie theater that becomes the focus of a pair of plots against the Nazi presence including the notorious colonel known as ""The Jew Hunter"" (Christoph Waltz) whose silky personality never masks his soullessness. As with Kill Bill Tarantino draws on broad influences for a story about revenge. Unlike with Kill Bill the disparate styles never cohere and the vengeance carries virtually no ambiguity. Theyre Nazis and they have it coming each section reminds us whether its staged like a spaghetti Western an early-80s music video or as broad comedy. Tarantino remains a master of creating tension from characters engaging in what only looks like polite conversation but the endless series of tense exchanges starts to feel flabby and unedited by the films end. So does Inglourious Basterds--a small tight thriller stretched to epic length.

Christoph Waltz (right) steals the film as evil Nazi Col. Hans Landa.       Photo Not your grandfathers or (fathers) World War II epic Quentin Tarantinos extremely witty revenge fantasy ""Inglourious Basterds"" may be the most fun youll have at the movies this summer. Of course your idea of a hoot has to include watching Jewish GIs led by Brad Pitt scalp German soldiers -- or beat them to death with a baseball bat. Its what torture-porn director Eli Roth who wields the Louisville Slugger as a Basterd nicknamed ""Bear Jew"" terms ""Jewish porn."" Despite overlength I think this is Tarantinos best film since ""Pulp Fiction"" though his legion of detractors will likely not appreciate the aging enfant terrible drastically rewriting history at a Paris movie premiere with help from a pair of femmes who put explosive new meaning in the word fatale. Billing aside ""Basterds"" does not center on Pitts gentile Tennessee hillbilly Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine who leads a mostly Jewish squad on a revenge-and-demoralization mission ""once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France."" (The deliberately misspelled title comes from a spaghetti-Western knockoff of ""The Dirty Dozen"" that provided very slight inspiration for Tarantinos movie.) From the very first scene -- arguably the best Tarantino has ever directed and one worthy of Hitchcock -- ""Basterds"" unquestionably belongs to Austrian actor Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa (nicknamed ""Jew Hunter"") who clearly enjoys playing with his prey even more than catching them. This sequence set in a 1941 farmhouse where Jews are hiding beneath the floorboards is alternately chilling (even when Landa orders a glass of milk) and hilarious (when he pulls a preposterously huge Sherlock Holmes-style pipe out of his pocket). We meet the sole survivor of the ensuing massacre Shosanna (Melanie Laurent excellent) four years later in Paris where she has reinvented herself as a gentile cinema owner. She attracts the attention of Frederick (Daniel Bruhl) a much-decorated German war hero who has re-created his exploits by playing himself in a new movie produced by Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels. When Frederick persuades Goebbels to move the premiere which will be attended by Nazi brass to her theater Shosanna hatches a plan to lock the doors of the theater and set fire to a cache of highly flammable nitrate film prints. Unbeknownst to her the British high command (exemplified by an unrecognizable Mike Myers in a cameo) has hatched its own more convoluted plot to blow up the cinema. This one involves the Basterds; Bridget (Diane Kruger very good) a glamorous German actress working for the Allies; and an English film critic (Michael Fassbender) turned soldier with a command of German. Those who decry Tarantinos self-indulgence (not to mention his utter disinterest in politics and religion) will probably point to a very long sequence in a basement tavern where several layers of impersonation -- and many many cinematic references -- entertainingly play out to their violent end. Much of ""Basterds"" is in subtitled German and French. Pitt and his Basterds mostly speak English but it may be worth the price of admission to see a tuxedoed Pitt trying to convince Col. Landa hes an Italian stuntman. Pitt is very funny as the jut-jawed Aldo who likes to carve swastikas into the heads of his surviving victims. But its Waltz -- an unknown to American audiences -- who really kills with some of Tarantinos best dialogue even if it is delivered mostly in German. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next INSIDE DESIGNERS CLOSETS Read Next INSIDE DESIGNERS CLOSETS Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 36605 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 18975 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 18509 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday August 20 2009 1157 AM Title Inglourious Basterds No Quentin Tarantino doesnt bother to explain why he ignored his spell-check when titling ""Inglourious Basterds."" But when a man makes a movie this good you can forgive him the occasional indulgence.Aside from the name in fact Tarantinos WWII adventure indicates an undeniable new maturity. A fairy tale about the infinite power of film it boasts all his swaggering trademarks rapid-fire dialogue gleeful violence endless cultural references. But its the sharp-eyed deliberation that makes the greatest impact.The terrific opening for example does feature a hailstorm of bullets. What youll remember best though is the haunted silence of actor Denis Menochet playing a French farmer accused of harboring Jews. And you may never forget his sadistic interrogator Nazi Col. Hans Landa (a knockout Christoph Waltz).Landa is the movies primary villain no minor feat in a film that features Hitler and Goebbels. After young Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) escapes his grasp she lands in Paris and runs a small cinema. She catches the eye of German soldier-turned-actor Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) who doesnt know shes Jewish. To her horror Zoller decides to hold his latest premiere - to be attended by every high-ranking Nazi from Hitler down - at her arthouse. Meanwhile a unit of Jewish-American soldiers led by Brad Pitts scenery-chomping Southerner is picking off Nazis by the dozen. When the troops (including Til Schweiger and ""Hostel"" director Eli Roth) hear about Zollers premiere they start planning to target the event aided by a glamorous German spy (Diane Kruger). But the wily Col. Landa is close on their trail.There will be those who say the movie is too violent and others who dont think its violent enough. But those complaints miss the point. For the first time Tarantinos blood fetish comes infused with more humanity than shock value. Where history failed film will succeed. So be warned This isnt ""Schindlers List"" (or even a remake of 1978s ""The Inglorious Bastards"" which provided little more than title inspiration). ""Basterds"" blends several genres but is far more spaghetti Western than historical epic.There are flaws of course including a few discordant performances (ahem Mike Myers) and the intermittent detour into self-congratulation. But if anyone can carry off a complete rewrite of reality its Tarantino. And as revenge fantasies go hes delivered.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Inglourious Basterds Revisionist romp | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesInglourious Basterds Revisionist rompGrammatically challenged factually unhinged and too long Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds nevertheless soars thanks to one glorious performance.Brad Pitt in a scene from Inglourious Basterds.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 20 2009Starring Brad Pitt Christoph Waltz Melanie Laurent Eli Roth Diane Kruger and Michael Fassbender. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. At major theatres. 14AGrammatically challenged factually unhinged and too long for its own good Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds nevertheless soars thanks to one glorious performance - and its not the one you think. Top-billed Brad Pitt is merely amusing as Tennessee moonshiner Lt. Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine who leads scalp-hunting Jewish-American soldiers against Hitler in the Nazi-occupied France of World War II. But hes almost a Sgt. Rock parody and hes MIA for vast stretches. (Martin Wuttkes sputtering Hitler meanwhile is close to a Mel Brooks homage.)Article Continued BelowThe films real star is Austrias Christoph Waltz a multilingual wizard who inhabits the role of Col. Hans Landa the smirking Gestapo officer known as ""The Jew Hunter"" for his uncanny sleuthing. Already feted with an acting award at Cannes Waltz is going to ride this movie all the way to an Oscar nomination.Count on it and give thanks for his complicated presence. Because if Inglourious Basterds really was simply about the collecting of hundreds of Nazi scalps as the trailer insists it is the gore would be unendurable - something akin to the torture porn that co-star Eli Roth makes in his other career as a horror director.Thankfully the blade-twirling and bat-wielding soldiers that Raine commands forget their accounting if not their mission. To be sure the film - opening tonight in midnight screenings - does provide a righteous rush to anyone tired of seeing Jews as docile victims which was Tarantinos stated intent. Heads are sliced and skulls are smashed - the latter being the specialty of Roths character wild-eyed baseball nut Sgt. Donny Donowitz. But the film is less violent than the bloodthirsty ads suggest and also less so than Tarantinos Kill Bill saga. These Basterds blend into a much richer story a hugely entertaining one with stars you dont immediately see shining.Inglourious Basterds is pure wish-fulfilment fantasy (""Once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France..."") in which Hitler and his stooges stand to get whats coming to them in a way that makes cinema itself seem like the grand liberator. The films strength paradoxically lies not in its transgressions but in its many digressions and it took me a second viewing to really appreciate this. Tarantino quickly tires of the main plot of his films. His better movies (Pulp Fiction is still the gold standard) find humour and drama in subplots and sideshows that fully animate the frame like a Mad magazine comic.Or maybe like the Sergio Leone spaghetti western that Tarantino tips to in the films bucolic prologue set in 1941. Its here we first meet Landa as he is interrogating a French dairy farmer seeking the whereabouts of a missing Jewish family. Landa makes the act of drinking milk seem evil as he pursues his hunch to a violent conclusion and a foreboding ""au revoir.""Lets skip the Basterds - you already know about them - and jump three years to the Paris of 1944 where comely movie theatre owner Emmanuelle (Frances Melanie Laurent another casting coup) is changing the marquee of her art deco bijou. Shes good at changing names.Her theatre which has already attracted the unwelcome attention of a love-struck German warrior (Daniel Bruhl) will be the nexus of an Allied bomb plot called ""Operation Kino."" In due course we will meet Bridget Von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) a German movie star working as a double agent; Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) a former film critic turned British soldier whose fluency in German and cinema lingo make him an ideal conscript; and General Ed Fenech (Mike Myers) a British military strategist who is the ""Basil Exposition"" of Inglourious Basterds giving us plot necessities by way of briefing Hicox (while Rod Taylor glowers nearby as Winston Churchill).All these people and many more besides make for a very crowded screen. The film might have been stronger had Tarantino simply dropped the British characters (more Basterds and fewer Brits) but perhaps not as satisfying - Fassbender and Myers are both a joy to watch. More deserving of trims is a tavern scene that brings the Brits the Yanks and the Nazis together on the eve of Operation Kino where Tarantinos weakness for verbosity is given free rein. He has actually lengthened the tavern interlude since its Cannes premiere (and perversely increased the films running time to 232 a minute longer) but his instincts prove sound. He has restored a set-up scene starring Pitt that gives the tavern section more flow and better drama.Much better though is an earlier restaurant scene starring Landa Emmanuelle and a smug Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) as they discuss plans to show the Nazi propaganda film Nations Pride at Emmanuelles theatre. Landa insists that reluctant Emmanuelle share a strudel with him demonstrating both gluttony and treachery as he closely watches her. Does he remember an earlier encounter?Such suspenseful moments help make Inglourious Basterds the revisionist romp it is even if you cant help but wish that Aldo and his boys could have swung their blades in the editing suite.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Credit AP Photo advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A group of World War II resistance fighters terrorizes The Third Reich. Three stars. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE This feels like vintage Tarantino not new Tarantino but its never anything less than ridiculously entertaining. CAST Brad Pitt Melanie Laurent Christoph Waltz Daniel Bruhl Diane Kruger DIRECTOR Quentin Tarantino LENGTH 232 The Nazis are the victims the Jews their slaughterers. The score is part spaghetti Western part French chanson. Brad Pitt looks like Clark Gable but talks like Forrest Gump. And during the final act of Quentin Tarantinos wildly unpredictable World War II epic ""Inglourious Basterds"" youll hear David Bowies 1982 theme song to ""Cat People."" Well why not? Tarantino has made a career out of breaking rules and redefining conventions turning torture into entertainment in ""Reservoir Dogs"" setting new standards for dialogue with ""Pulp Fiction"" and transforming B-movie schlock into art with ""Grindhouse"" (codirected with Robert Rodriguez). Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Tarantino is the most fearlessly inventive filmmaker alive - but we knew that. And while ""Inglourious Basterds"" is never anything less than ridiculously entertaining its nothing Tarantino hasnt done before. Inspired by Enzo G. Castellaris similarly titled 1978 cheapie (with the proper spelling of both words) the movie combines several nifty ideas into one almost-story. Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt) commands a rogue group of murderous Jews (including ""Hostel"" director Eli Roth). A Parisian cinema owner (Melanie Laurent) hosts a film premiere attended by Hitler. And a German film star (Diane Kruger channeling Marlene Dietrich) doubles as an Allied spy. Tarantinos biggest achievement may be tricking Americans into watching a 21/2-hour foreign film with four languages subtitles and a thrilling international cast that covers Ireland France Germany and Canada (look for Mike Myers as a British officer). But no one can match Christoph Waltz who steals the show as Col. Hans Landa arguably the happiest Nazi in screen history. MoviesTrailer Inglourious Basterds Everything comes together more or less with plenty of blood brains and bullets. But while ""Inglourious Basterds"" is technically Tarantinos newest movie it somehow doesnt feel like it. advertisement | advertise on newsday Elis coming hide your Nazis As Eli Roth - who plays Donny Donowitz a merciless baseball-bat-wielding Nazi killer in ""Inglourious Basterds"" - tells it he became director Quentin Tarantinos ""Jewish fact-checker"" on the project almost by default. Roths input ultimately enabled the writer-director to imbue the resolution of ""Basterds"" with a higher degree of psychological realism. This began with Roth inviting Tarantino to his family home for Passover seder in 2007 the directors first. ""We got into these long philosophical discussions about the Holocaust and slavery oppression"" Roth said. ""He asked me Would a Jew give absolution to a Nazi at the end of the war? I said Never. Its purely a Christian construct. Its not that we dont forgive; we dont forget. Being Jewish is to remember. If I had the chance I would kill every one of those ."" Roth also invited his parents to Berlin to take part in filming a scene in which 300 extras dressed in Nazi regalia attend a screening of ""Nations Pride"" the propaganda movie-within-a-movie. Never mind that many of his relatives were killed in the Holocaust - or that his mother and father had sworn never to set foot in Germany.Upon landing in Berlin Roths parents visited the Holocaust Museum and changed their stance on modern Germany. On set later in the day they displayed a willingness to enter into the films historical-revisionist fantasy posing for photos with the actor who portrays Hitler in Basterds. - Los Angeles Times Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Comments (6) click to enlarge Inglourious Basterds Recommended Video Rated R  153 minutes  2009 Quentin Tarantinos long-awaited action flick (2009) isnt a World War II movie--its a movie about World War II movies and by extension how the Third Reich has become a beloved fixture of American pop culture. One story line riffs on The Dirty Dozen and its ilk with Brad Pitt as a Tennessee cracker leading a squad of Jewish-American badasses on a search-and-destroy mission through Nazi-occupied France. The other stars Melanie Laurent as the secretly Jewish proprietor of a Parisian movie palace whos plotting to incinerate the German high command at the premiere screening of a Nazi propaganda epic. Tarantino has already caught some flack for daring to use the Holocaust as material for another of his bloody live-action cartoons but of course the generation that experienced it for real has mostly faded away. In that sense Inglourious Basterds is a social marker as startling as Easy Rider was in its day. By J.R.

Askillful director can make us invest in characters we dont resemble from homesick aliens to gay cowboys. Quentin Tarantino has built his career on selling low-life thugs to pasty geeks and art-house aesthetes. In the World War II thriller ""Inglourious Basterds"" the thugs are the good guys a platoon of Jewish-Americans who wreak vengeance behind Nazi lines.With its exploded notions of heroism torture-rack dramatics and kamikaze gusto its a fiendishly entertaining flick.The most entertaining fiend is SS Col. Hans Landa (scene-stealing Austrian actor Christoph Waltz). After he pays a social call on a French farmer and skillfully extracts the whereabouts of some Jewish refugees a teenage girl named Shoshana slips through the dragnet. Landa knows they will meet again. It happens years later when Shoshana (Melanie Laurent) is operating a movie theater in Paris. The Nazi occupiers are looking for a venue to screen their newest propaganda film starring sharpshooter Frederick Zoller ""the German Sgt. York."" After Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) meets and falls for the now-blond beauty he advises his commanders including Landa to screen the movie in her theater.With the Nazi glitterati converging on one spot Shoshana devises a devilish plot to exterminate them. What she doesnt know is that theres a parallel plot. The gathering has been uncovered by Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) a heroic English film critic who is smuggled into France to rendezvous with a turncoat German actress (Diane Kruger) and the squad of cutthroats that the Nazis have dubbed the Basterds.The Basterds are led by a cocky-but-dimwitted Southerner named Lt. Aldo Raines (Brad Pitt in full smirk mode) who infiltrates the swank premiere with three bilingual assassins (the colorfully monikered Omar Doom B.J. Novak of ""The Office"" and director-turned-actor Eli Roth). Did we mention that Hitler is in the audience?It takes a fanboy like Tarantino to literalize the idea that movies can change the world. The director is clearly having a blast casting forgotten favorites (including Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill and Bo Svenson of the original ""The Inglorious Bastards"" a cut-rate Italian ""Dirty Dozen"") glorifying gore and machine-gunning allusions to his favorite war movies and spaghetti Westerns. But Tarantino backs up the brattiness with craft. His exquisite visuals lively dialogue and diabolical pacing ensure that this long movie never drags.If theres a weakness here its that most of the Basterds arent vividly characterized. Some of them dont even get to speak. So we dont feel the moral outrage behind their butchery.But we do feel it from Shoshana the latest in a long line of strong Tarantino heroines. Her battle royale to avenge her family is a movie unto itself. Tarantino might call it ""Une Glourious Bee-otch.""

Inglourious Basterds Good Director Quentin Tarantino. Cast Brad Pitt Christoph Waltz Eli Roth. Rating R for strong graphic violence language and brief sexuality. Related With Basterds Tarantino answers critics Waltz crafts linguistic magic for Basterds Roth Surviving Tarantinos Basterds Spotlight Brad Pitt Spotlight Quentin Tarantino World War II movies If youre Tarantino absolutely. At least thats the case in ""Inglourious Basterds"" his World War II fantasy that even manages to use film stock as a weapon. Thats a nice touch the usual attention to goofball detail weve come to expect. ""Basterds"" based extremely loosely on a little-known-and-lesser-seen 1978 film is too long draws out a few scenes a little too much bounces around more than one might like. Not that any of those things matters all that much. Tarantino crams enough movie-loving passion into the film - as well as a great performance by Austrian actor Christoph Waltz who is so good he can (and does) creep you out by merely asking for a glass of milk - to keep you not just entertained but occasionally riveted. Above all else its a really enjoyable ride. He tells the story in five chapters the first of which is a dead-solid perfect face-off between Col. Hans Landa (Waltz) and dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet) in occupied France. Landa is known as ""the Jew hunter."" He is very good at a very bad job and he is questioning LaPadite about a Jewish family that Landa and his troops havent been able to locate. But Landa is an evil master of subtlety. He is not overtly threatening (though his mere presence certainly is) but hes insidious. The scene lasts several minutes and Landa like Tarantino is willing to be patient. The tension becomes nearly unbearable. Somethings bound to happen but what? Later we meet the Basterds Jewish soldiers under the command of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt hick accent in full bloom) a Tennessee mountain boy whose mission simply put is to kill Nazis. But not just kill them. Scalp them. Humiliate what few survivors he allows to escape. Treat them with the same lack of humanity they treat their enemies with or if possible even less. Years pass and the Basterds reputation is solidified. Meanwhile in Paris we meet Shoshanna (Melanie Laurent) who owns a theater and has no use for Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) a Nazi war hero whos smitten with her. Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) is making a movie about Zollers exploits with Zoller himself starring. Shoshanna is steadfastly unimpressed for reasons that become quickly clear. Goebbels decides to hold the premiere of the film at Shoshannas theater; Shoshanna decides this is an excellent chance to exact revenge. Unbeknownst to her the Allies are aware of the premiere which Hitler is scheduled to attend and see it as a great opportunity. This leads to an extended scene in the basement of a tavern in which German actress and double agent Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) briefs members of the Basterds on the plot. A suspicious Nazi officer (August Diehl) complicates things and suddenly every word - every accent with which the words are pronounced - becomes fraught with tension. The scene plays a little too long alas but it contains some signature Tarantino moments moments in which even the smallest lack of attention to detail can prove fatal. And if theres something Tarantino knows about its details. The use of David Bowies ""Cat People (Putting Out Fire)"" last heard in the 1982 remake of ""Cat People"" during a crucial moment. It sounds like exactly the wrong thing to use. Its perfect of course. This sort of knowledge and love of film is everywhere as always. And the typical lack of restraint bears the usual inconsistent results. But ""Inglourious Basterds"" is so dense with just pure film stuff that any fan of movies will find it something close to glorious. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Inglourious Basterds | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; inglourious-basterds ) Inglourious Basterds (United States 2009) August 18 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli With Inglourious Basterds Quentin Tarantino has made his best movie since Pulp Fiction. He has also made what could arguably be considered the most audacious World War II movie of all-time. If you think there are rules for this sort of motion picture guess again. And its not just that Tarantino is using the spaghetti western as his template; its that the sheer unpredictability of where all this is going makes it compelling from beginning to end. Even the films occasional artistic flourishes (such as chapter titles and out-of-period music pieces) work within the context of what Tarantino is trying to accomplish. This is clearly an attempt by the director to expand his range and step outside of the comfort zone in which he has worked for the majority of his career. Tarantino brings to Inglourious Basterds his not inconsiderable knowledge of films. The movie is awash in references - some subtle some obvious - that run the gamut from D-grade exploitation flicks to A-list classics. This is not as has been reported in some places a remake of the 1978 feature The Inglorious Bastards although the title is an homage. Reportedly some of Tarantinos nascent versions of the screenplay used elements of the earlier film but those are mostly gone in the final edition. This is pretty much 100% Tarantino which could be good or bad depending on your opinion of the mans work. The plot follows two stories and expectedly brings them together at the end. In the first chapter we are introduced to Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) a French Jew hiding with her family under the floorboards of a dairy farmers house. The farmer is visited by the outwardly charming SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) who has earned the nickname ""The Jew Hunter."" Unlike the average movie Nazi this guy is smart - Sherlock Holmes smart. He quickly deduces that the farmer is harboring fugitives and has his men open fire at the floor. Shosanna is the only one to escape the massacre. She flees to Paris where when the movie catches up with her later on she is running a movie theater under an assumed name. The other story follows the adventures of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and his merry group of American ""Basterds."" They have parachuted into France behind enemy lines and are wreaking havoc. Their goal kill Nazis. They dont take prisoners; they take scalps. They have become so infamous that even Hitler knows about them. Churchill and the British high command send in one of their own Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) with a plan. New intelligence indicates that nearly the entire German upper echelon will be at a small theater in Paris for the premiere of a new propaganda film. The goal is to blow up the theater and kill as many of Hitlers top men as possible. To facilitate this the Basterds will make contact with a double agent German actress Bridget von Hammersmart (Diane Kruger). She will get them close enough to plant the bomb. Of course the theater in question is the one owned by Shosanna. Tarantino loves dialogue and between taut brutal action sequences theres a lot of talking. The conversations arent as elliptical as some of those in the directors previous efforts but there are some intriguing moments - a Nazi providing a detailed comparison between Jew-hunting and rat-hunting a 20 questions-like guessing game with the answer of ""King Kong"" and a reverse Cinderella encounter in which having a foot to fit the shoe is not a good thing. (Tarantino gets his trademark foot fetish shot in this scene.) There is a point to the talk however that goes beyond the filmmaker showing off his skill with words. All these scenes precede instances of sudden violent action and the threat of bloodshed is heavy in the air. With every sentence the tension mounts. Tarantino uses these sequences to prime the audience teasing them until the suspense is nearly unbearable then releasing it in one explosive burst. Watching Inglourious Basterds I was reminded of Paul Verhoevens Black Book and Bryan Singers Valkyrie both of which contain themes and ideas that are echoed here. This is no Schindlers List. Its not about nobility or sacrifice. Its about the dirty bloody side of war. Yes theres heroism but a lot is hidden away in order for those who receive medals to retain a patina of valor. Inglourious Basterds is suffused with dark humor - so much so that its tempting to label it an action/comedy. There are laugh-out-loud moments and not one guffaw is the result of something unintentional. This is nothing new for Tarantino who has always interwoven humor with violence but its incorporation here amidst some of his bleakest material is refreshingly unsettling. Most Tarantino films feature at least one high-profile actor in a major role and in this case its Brad Pitt. From his opening speech about the mission - one that recalls monologues from The Dirty Dozen and Patton - Pitt is clearly in character. His capabilities as an actor are often overlooked because of his high-profile off-screen image but he takes chances and rarely gives a bad performance. (Its no coincidence hes liked by the Coen Brothers and Soderbergh.) As Raine hes in top form getting most of the best lines and generating a lot of the humor. The role is unlikely to garner Pitt an Oscar nomination but it will be remembered. Pitts co-lead (although they never share the screen) is French actress Melanie Laurent with whose body of work I am unfamiliar. She stands out - good looks and good acting. The character is nicely written indicating that any previous problems Tarantino may have had with penning strong female characters were corrected in Kill Bill. Shes from the same mold as Black Books lead - as deadly as she is attractive and ruthless beneath the seemingly unprepossessing exterior. Diane Kruger is the only other woman with a significant role in Inglourious Basterds but Laurent is more memorable. Christoph Waltz won an acting award at Cannes for his portrayal of Landa the Jew Hunter and its one of those deliciously twisted roles designed to unsettle audiences. Hes like the lion who curls up at your feet and purrs as you stroke it then suddenly jumps up and rips off your arm. Its a charismatic portrayal that shows how insidious evil can be. Perhaps thats unfair - Landa is not so much evil as he is coldly logical amoral and opportunistic. The character is a formidable adversary; Waltz is a formidable thespian. Theres a little stunt casting involved although not as much as there might have been had scheduling conflicts not kept Adam Sandler from appearing. The role he was to play went to Eli Roth. Its interesting that the director of the ""torture porn"" Hostel movies should appear as a soldier who loves to beat Nazis to a pulp with a baseball bat while everyone around cheers. (""Its the closest thing we have to a movie"" comments Raine at one point.) The only one who sticks out like a sore thumb is Mike Myers (playing a British general). Hes not very good and hes not sufficiently camouflaged to avoid calling attention to himself. Inglourious Basterds isnt as fresh and freewheeling as Pulp Fiction but Tarantino is now an established director and a known quantity. That he is able to successfully pull off some of what he does in this movie is a testimony to his skill at both writing and directing. Yes - he borrows heavily and shamelessly from other movies but its in the unique fusion of those sources and styles that he achieves his success. Despite having so many antecedents Inglourious Basterds quickly carves out its own niche. The running length is a gaudy 153 minutes yet the film moves so smoothly and the moving parts come together so cleanly that the time passes easily. This is the movie I have been awaiting since Pulp Fiction. Its one hell of an enjoyable ride into the nightmare that was Nazi-occupied France and thinking you know how it all ends doesnt make it so.

"Inglourious Basterds review Roger Moores movie review of Inglourious Basterds - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Inglourious Basterds -- 1 out of 5 stars Alexander Fehling Zack Volker Michalowski Diane Kruger Arndt Schweringsohnrey and Ken Duken TWC TWC Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Hollywoods two most indulged enfant terrible filmmakers have now made the worst two World War II movies of this millennium. With Inglourious Basterds Quentin Tarantino has topped Spike Lee ( Miracle at St. Anna) in awfulness.Tarantino has remade a really bad Italian-made WWII thriller into an intentionally dumb and violent shoot-em up with barely a hint of the original film. And he remade it at quarter-speed. Inglourious is slow dumb -- and in a first for QT in his cinema savant career --incompetent. From the first image in it -- a French farmer chopping wood with no wood to chop (he just whacks a chopping block) -- Tarantino acts as if hes determined to match the 1978 Inglorious Bastards in ineptitude.The Nazis wear leather love their strudel and have impeccable manners as they carry out The Final Solution. The Americans are Jewish GIs recruited by Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine ( Brad Pitt) a drawling commando who gives a mean pep talk. ""We will be cruel to the Germans"" he tells his team (Hostel director Eli Roth among them). ""And they will know us through our cruelty.""He orders his men to scalp the enemy. He tortures any German he can get his hands on. He even recruits a German who killed a bunch of Gestapo agents to his corps.Meanwhile the urbane and cunning Col. Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz) is hunting French Jews and tracking the ""Inglourious Basterds"" who have been wreaking havoc in 1944 Occupied France. In Paris a Jew in hiding (Melanie Laurent) runs a local cinema where she resists the charms of the German war hero (Daniel Bruhl) whose exploits have been made into a new Nazi propaganda film.Diane Kruger shows up as a famous German actress the ancient Rod Taylor cameos as Winston Churchill and Mike Myers isnt remotely convincing as a British officer ordering a British film critic (Michael Fassbender) into a mission involving a movie premiere and a lot of high-ranking Nazis. For two and a half hours Tarantino hurls this hooey against a wall and tries to make it connect -- long supposedly tense scenes play like student-filmmaker Nazi interrogations. But Pitt the movie star delivers fair value. Every Billy Bob-drawled word out of that Leno-jutting jaw is funny.""It you ever wanna eat a sauerkraut sammich again"" he threatens one Nazi before turning him over to ""The Bear Jew"" a GI who beats prisoners to death with a baseball bat.But even scenes that work drag on in German and French as if Tarantino didnt know the German or French words for ""faster.""Heres another one he didnt pick up -- schadenfreude. Quentin haters will be overdosing on that for the next few days. At least Spike will be grateful.Inglourious Basterds 1 of 5 starsCast Brad Pitt Melanie Laurent Christopher Waltz Diane Krueger Mike Myers.Director Quentin Tarantino.Running time 2 hours 35 minutes.Industry rating R for strong graphic violence language and brief sexuality.

It is also one whale of a rigorous entertainment. The wild plot In World War II-occupied France a band of bloodthirsty American Jews form a battalion of renegade guerrilla soldiers without approval or military supervision dedicated to the merciless torture and death of all Nazis. They dont take prisoners. They butcher their captives performing shocking acts of execution mutilating their corpses and bashing like eggshells the skulls of their victims with baseball bats. Their leader is Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) an Indian from the Smoky Mountains with a rope burn around his neck from a narrow encounter with a hangmans noose; his specialty is scalping Nazis while theyre still alive--a talent that earns him the nickname ""Apache."" Under Apaches command the units war crimes escalate littering the 1941 landscape with more corpses than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Hills Have Eyes and Saving Private Ryan combined. With little attention to narrative detail the movie suddenly jumps to 1944 and Apache leads the ""basterds"" to Berlin to blow up a movie house where Hitler Goebbels Goering and the entire leadership of the Third Reich are attending the movie premiere of a Nazi war propaganda film during a Leni Riefenstahl film festival. Preposterous of course but according to Mr. Tarantino what more logical way to end the Holocaust than to go up in flames from flammable nitrate film stock in three-strip Technicolor with the cameras rolling? Would you believe the basterds chief allies in this big noisy finale are a revered Marlene Dietrich-style film star and a covert double agent who is really a British film critic with an expertise in German cinema? You gotta love it. Facetious and sprawling over two and a half hours the film is often unintentionally hilarious but I hastily add never tedious. Both the German barbarism and the testosterone-infused American brutality are exploitative in styles that borrow freely from every war movie Mr. Tarantino has ever discovered in the video rental shops he calls home. In all of his films he specializes in exposing with imagery and well-crafted vignettes humanitys capacity for violence and stupidity. But when hes accused of film school smugness and fractured plagiarism I cant entirely disagree. Inspired by everything from the German cinema of Murnau Pabst and Josef von Sternberg (Emil Jannings even shows up for the premiere) to Hogans Heroes and (most glaringly) Paul Verhoevens fabulous Nazi saga The Black Book Mr. Tarantino borrows and steals so many cliches from other peoples movies that Im surprised he didnt throw in the little girl in the red coat from Schindlers List. A monstre sacre for Gen Xers who like their movies loud outrageous and obnoxious Mr. Tarantino is so immune to opinion that he cant even spell the title right and nobody challenges him. By the time he gets around to rewriting the end of World War II his arrogance is positively de rigueur. Hes like an idiot savant. If you crave Holocaust accuracy see Heimat or all nine hours of Shoah. If you want the most disgusting patronizing and manipulatively sentimental crap movie ever made about the subject revisit Life Is Beautiful. Mr. Tarantino aims for neither end of the scale; as war movies go this one never rises to the level of Elem Klimovs 1985 epic tragedy Come and See or sinks to the depths of The Dirty Dozen Hollywood heroics. The important thing to remember is that Inglourious Basterds is in no way intended to be taken seriously--and as pure hokum it delivers. Mr. Tarantino is pretty generally considered in serious circles as a wickedly overrated amateur but in his defense I admire the way he makes no claim to ""art"" so you cant say hes pretentious. Hes as self-conscious and referential a movie ""fan"" as mainstream entertainment can be which makes him a welcome adversary of the kind of creeping art-house paralysis I generally hate--phony self-conscious and booooring (Lars von Trier anyone?) His limitations are obvious. He sees everything from the viewpoint of a teenage faux-cool dude which means his films rarely delve any deeper than juvenile posturing. So as with Pulp Fiction he makes Inglourious Basterds stylish and riveting without producing any remotely profound insight. It totally reflects not the age of its setting but the age that has informed its director--a time of pop videos Playstations the Internet CGI and 24-hour digital TV with ads inserted every eight minutes for bathroom breaks. So expect World War II as seen through an issue of DC Comics. The gung-ho ""basterds"" are louts who storm the barriers like Hogans heroes; the comic-book Nazis are Katzenjammer Kids; and nobody displays much icy wit except for one Nazi colonel who steals the picture. (More about him in the next paragraph.) Among the casting errors comedian Mike Myers plays a British officer with makeup and prosthetics that render him unrecognizable; the terrific Irish actor Michael Fassbender (devastating in Hunger as Bobby Sands the IRA prisoner who starved himself to death in prison) plays the undercover movie critic who parachutes behind enemy lines to kill off Der Fuhrer; and a bulbous Rod Taylor makes a guest appearance as Winston Churchill. The dismally miscast Brad Pitt upstaged by an exaggerated Southern accent that imitates choking on grits and grillades acts with a grim intensity like hes the only one whos not in on the joke. The film turns ludicrous when he crashes the premiere festooned with swastikas pretending to be an Italian extra and sounding like Gomer Pyle. On the plus side I was bowled over by Christoph Waltz a juicy flamboyant Austrian actor who speaks perfect English in the unforgettable role of the finger-licking Gestapo Colonel Hans Landa a combination of every handsome blue-eyed movie Nazi from Otto Preminger and Helmut Dantine to Ralph Fiennes in Schindlers List. Passionate about gourmet food and fresh milk oozing a lethal charm that thinly veils a capacity for murderous outrage Mr. Waltz emanates such energy and discipline that hes one 35-millimeter Nazi who deserves an Academy Award. The funniest thing in the movie is his final offer with the war coming to a disastrous end to help kill the leaders of the German high command in exchange for the Congressional Medal of Honor U.S. citizenship and a house in Nantucket. Mr. Tarantino knows how to frame a scene. The color movement and sound are as good as in Pulp Fiction the dialogue is a slight improvement over Reservoir Dogs and the scene where the Gestapo invade a French farmhouse to massacre a Jewish family hiding under the floor is better than anything in Kill Bill. World War II was more serious complex and horrifying than all this comic embellishment but if I sound critical I apologize in advance. I had a helluva time watching Inglourious Basterds. Its as frenzied as a dog in heat. Mr. Tarantino lacks nuance but hes an erratic awkward and often brilliant filmmaker. In time he might even become a mature one. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under Brad Pitt Christoph Waltz Diane Kruger Eli Roth Inglourious Basterds Melanie Laurent Michael Fassbender movie On the Town Quentin Tarantino Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Breaking Miamis Wynwood Arts District Is a Hotbed for Zika Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2009/08/i-had-a-helluva-time-watching-inglourious-basterds/,200,inglouriousbasterds33,inglouriousbasterds,com/2009/08/i-had-a-helluva-time-watching-inglourious-basterds/

Hoberman Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds Makes Holocaust Revisionism Fun Tuesday August 18 2009 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Brad Pitt Nazi hunterFrancois Duhamel/The Weinstein Company A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Energetic inventive swaggering fun Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds is a consummate Hollywood entertainment--rich in fantasy and blithely amoral.Its also quintessential Tarantino--even more drenched in film references than gore with a proudly misspelled title (lifted from Italian genre-meister Enzo Castellaris 1978 Dirty Dozen knockoff) to underscore the movies cinematic hyperliteracy. Tepidly received in Cannes and thereafter tweaked Inglourious Basterds may still be a tad long at two and a half hours and a little too pleased with itself but its tough to resist the enthusiastic performances and terrific dialogue--if youre not put off by the juvenile premise or cartoonish savagery. (See Ella Taylors interview with Quentin Tarantino here.)Not the years preeminent genre exercise (The Hurt Locker is a superior war film as well as a serious reworking of the Hawksian group drama) Inglourious Basterds is something sui generis--a two-fisted Hollywood occupation romance in which a Jewish special unit wreaks vengeance on the Nazis. It also has the best Western opener in decades The first of five chapters nods to Sergio Leone with the title ""Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France"" and to the genre in general with a shot of a French farm family hanging their laundry as a Nazi convoy approaches in the distance like a Comanche band. Violence is not immediately forthcoming--Inglourious Basterds is as much talk-talk as bang-bang. Or rather as Andrew Sarris described the characteristic Budd Boetticher Western its a ""floating poker game"" in which characters many of whom have assumed false identities take turns bluffing for their lives.The first of a half-dozen one-on-one verbal jousts pits a taciturn salt-of-the-earth peasant against a loquacious Nazi colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) who humorously officious hypnotizes his prey with a twinkling eye giant grin and steady stream of civilized chatter. Landa the S.S. functionary assigned to rid France of Jews is not only the movies villain but also its master of revels. Waltzs turn isnt the lone showy performance--Mike Myers has a ripe cameo as the British general who conceives the films convoluted Operation Kino and Diane Kruger is convincingly unconvincing as a German movie diva channeling Mata Hari. (Her exasperated ""Can you Americans speak any other language except English?"" brought down the house at Cannes.)But theres a reason why the hitherto unknown Waltz was named Best Actor at Cannes appears on the current Film Comment cover and is the subject of an ""Arts amp; Leisure"" profile. Waltzs elegant and clever S.S. man is the movies most crowd-pleasing creation--another in the long line of glamorous Hollywood Nazis. (See Tom Cruise in Valkyrie for a recent example.) Indeed this smooth operator is Eichmann as fun guy Hes also a European sissy whose ""barbaric"" antagonists are a squad of Jewish-American commandos led by wily hillbilly Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). The Jews are out for blood and Raine promises his eponymous Basterds that under his leadership they will terrorize the Germans with ""Apache tactics"" demanding only that each contribute 100 Nazi scalps.Given its subject and the directors track record Inglourious Basterds has less mayhem than one might expect. Theres nothing comparable here--either as choreographed violence or virtuoso filmmaking--to the D-Day landing that opens Saving Private Ryan. (But neither is there anything as false sanctimonious and emotionally manipulative as the rest of Spielbergs movie.) Inglourious Basterds is essentially conceptual and as with any Western all about determining the nature of permissible aggression. Operating like a cross between the Dirty Dozen and a Nazi death squad the Basterds take no prisoners--designated ""survivors"" are shipped back to Germany swastikas carved in their foreheads to spook the brass. The rest are sent to Valhalla most spectacularly by Sgt. Donny Donowitz (exploitation director Eli Roth) who uses a Louisville slugger to bash German brains. ""Watching Donny beat Nazis to death is as close as we get to the movies"" one of the Basterds exults tipping Tarantinos hand.The heroine of and most artificial construct in Inglourious Basterds is Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) Jewish survivor of a Nazi massacre hiding in plain sight as the proprietress of a Paris movie theater. ""We have respect for directors in this country"" she curtly tells the flirtatious German soldier who wonders why she includes G.W. Pabsts name on her marquee. Shosanna articulates Tarantinos own cinephile credo His characters live and die in (and sometimes at) the movies and only there. Tarantino cant resist dispatching two characters in a John Woo-style slow-mo double shoot-out staged in a projection booth or taunting Hitler (Martin Wuttke) and Goebbels (Sylvester Groth re-creating his role in Dani Levys recently released My Fuhrer) by forcing them to witness an allusion from their supposed favorite movie--Metropolis--in what could be their final moments on earth.In a sense Inglourious Basterds is a form of science fiction. Everything unfolds in and maps an alternate universe The Movies. Even Shosannas Parisian neighborhood bears a marked resemblance to a Cannes back alley complete with a club named for a notorious local dive. Inflammable nitrate film is a secret weapon. Goebbels is an evil producer; the German war hero who pursues Shosanna has (like Americas real-life Audie Murphy) become a movie star. Set to David Bowies Cat People title-song the scene in which Shosanna--who is of course also an actor--applies her war paint to become the glamorous ""face of Jewish vengeance"" is an interpolated music video. Actresses give autographs at their peril. The spectacular climax has the newly dead address those about to die from the silver screen. Operation Kino depends not only on Shosannas movie house and the German movie divas complicity but a heroic film critic () played by Michael Fassbender.Inglourious Basterds is hardly the first movie to place World War II in the context of American show business. (Each in his way movie stars John Wayne and Ronald Reagan made a career out of playing soldier while the war was actually on.) Basterds coarse ranting ridiculously caped Hitler certainly contributes to the wars vaudevillization but the notion of Hitler as screaming infant was more eloquently demonstrated several years ago when a hilarious meme swept the Internet subtitling a key tantrum from Downfall the 2005 German drama of Hitler in the bunker Bruno Ganzs disheveled fuhrer was made to browbeat his generals about everything from his lost Xbox to the Superbowl upset to Obamas victory (in the guise of Hillary Clinton). With the evil genius of the 20th century already a joke everywhere outside of Germany--and perhaps even there--Tarantinos particular genius has been to provide a suitably regressive scenario for the sandbox war that cost 50 million lives.The Producers might seem an obvious precursor but theres a difference between victim and victor mocking Hitler. European Jews were losers; decimated by the war their only victory was in individual survival. Where the Brooks scenario involves dancing on the monsters grave (a contemporary Purim play) the Tarantino scenario is less cathartic than bizarrely triumphalist. Even something as untalented as Levys My Fuhrer has a modicum of therapeutic value--if only for being created by a German Jew in Germany. Levys fantasy conceives Hitler as a grotesque brat and a Jewish protagonist plucked from the Auschwitz death mills for the express purpose of bolstering the fuhrers confidence as the lone adult in a world of Nazi buffoons. By contrast Inglourious Basterds basically enables Jews to act like Nazis engaging in cold-blooded massacres and mass incineration pushing wish fulfillment to a near-psychotic break with reality.Tarantinos movie ends with its corniest character (Pitt) proclaiming that a particular Old Testament barbarism just might be his masterpiece. As I wrote from Cannes this movie could well be Tarantinos--if masterpiece is taken to mean the fullest expression of a particular artists worldview. At Cannes Roth characterized the movie as ""kosher porn."" Tarantino was less provocative and more grandiose--""The power of cinema is going to bring down the Third Reich. . . . I get a kick out of that""--but he too was reveling in the compensatory reductive aspect of the movies.Here is an alternate World War II in which Jews terrorize and slaughter Nazis--a just Holocaust. Schindlers List comforted audiences with similar albeit less outrageous reversals (the list is life not death; concentration camp showers gush water not gas). However devoted to movie magic however Spielberg would never be so tasteless as to admit the excitement he experienced in asserting his will over history.jhobermanvillagevoice.com Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

Movie Quiz Pittsburgher movie quiz for yunz Is Birdman star Michael Keaton the best actor with western Pennsylvania ties? Click here to play the Tribs tongue-in-cheek attempt to find out. If only Quentin Tarantino the director werent so completely in love with Quentin Tarantino the writer ""Inglourious Basterds"" might have been a great movie rather than just a good movie with moments of greatness. Everything thats thrilling and maddening about his films co-exists and co-mingles here the visual dexterity and the interminable dialogue the homage to cinema and the self-glorifying drive to redefine it the compelling bursts of energy and the numbingly draggy sections. And then there is the violence of course violence as a source of humor as sport violence merely because it looks cool on camera and because the 46-year-old Tarantino still has the sensibilities of a 12-year-old boy. ""Inglourious Basterds"" also reflects the discipline or lack thereof of an adolescent -- one whos never been told ""no."" Certain scenes of his wildly revisionist World War II saga have a wonderfully palpable tension but then he undermines them by allowing them to go on too long. You expect talkiness in a Tarantino film but rather than whisking you away in waves of poetry as he did with the Oscar-winning ""Pulp Fiction"" screenplay he co-wrote too often here his talk lacks snap. As for the plot ... well it might be in there somewhere among the many meandering threads. In one of them ""Inglourious Basterds"" follows a band of Jewish American soldiers led by twangy Tennessean Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) who hunt Nazis with the goal of not just killing them but scalping them and sometimes carving swastikas into their foreheads. Pitt is a hoot by the way in the tradition of his best comic supporting work in films like ""Snatch"" and ""Burn After Reading."" Hes pretty much doing a bad impression of George W. Bush -- campy but irresistible -- and it is always such a joy to watch him let go and goof off. Among his ""Dirty Dozen""-style crew are ""Hostel"" director Eli Roth as a Boston native who likes to take a baseball bat to the enemys skull as if he were Ted Williams facing a fastball. But Pitt isnt the star despite being the biggest name and marketing focal point. ""Inglourious Basterds"" also intertwines the stories of Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent in a subtle and intense performance) a young Jewish woman who fled to Paris and opened a movie theater after Nazis killed her family; Hans Landa (a commanding Christoph Waltz) the cool but cruelly conniving Nazi colonel who orchestrated that attack; German movie star Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger oozing old-school glamour) whos an undercover agent for the Brits; and Nazi war hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) whos about to become a star by playing himself in a propaganda flick about his exploits. All these characters converge one night at Shosannas theater where their various ambitions and murder plots collide. The climax is a seriously over-the-top explosion -- even for a Tarantino movie -- of flames gunfire and screaming teeming masses. After respectfully ripping off other directors his whole life perhaps this is intended as a parody of himself but even he doesnt seem to know how to handle it. While the path to that moment can be torturous it can also be a visual wonder. ""Inglourious Basterds"" may be Tarantinos most artfully photographed film next to his ""Kill Bill"" movies (Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson shot them all) with spaghetti Western touches at the beginning eventually giving way to dramatic noir imagery by the end. But for every inspiring moment or performance -- Waltz especially stands out in four different languages no less -- Tarantino frustrates in equal measure.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Revenge Is Sweet Quentin Tarantinos WWII wet dream of vengeance Inglourious Basterds was worth the wait. _ By David Edelstein Published Aug 17 2009 ShareThis Brad Pitt on the set of Inglourious Basterds.  (Photo Francois Duhamel/Courtesy of the Weinstein Company) The common view of Quentin Tarantino as a sicko gore freak (largely due to the ear-slicing scene in Reservoir Dogs geysers of blood in Kill Bill and sundry splashy slo-mo dismemberments-via-automobile in Death Proof) overlooks his real gift which is for long and fraught and winding dialogues before the carnage erupts. Watching his World War II action thriller Inglourious Basterds [sic] you might wish the blood would never come The payoffs are common but the foreplay is killer. Even more than his other genre mash-ups this is a switchback journey through Tarantinos twisted inner landscape where cinema and history misogyny and feminism sadism and romanticism collide and split and re-bond in bizarre new hybrids. The movie is an ungainly pastiche yet on some wacked-out Jungian level its all of a piece. The movie centersno thats wrong it has no center its all over the damn mapit features a squad of American Jews in German-occupied France led by non-Jewish part-Apache Southerner Aldo Raine played by Brad Pitt puffing out his jaw to look (in his dreams) like Marlon Brando. The Basterds are famous throughout the Third Reich for scalping and/or bludgeoning Nazis. Of course it never happened Its an unabashed wet dream of vengeance. Yet watching Raine grill a kneeling commandant astride scalped Nazis while a nearby Jew (filmmaker Eli Roth) with a baseball bat takes scary practice swings you so wish it had. Whats not to love? The interrogation (and brain-bashing) is a much-needed emotional release following the overture which grounds Inglourious Basterds in the real worldat least through the prism of cinema. To the twang of Ennio Morricone spaghetti Western music (appropriated like most of the score from another film) a French farmer watches a jeep filled with Nazis travel the road to his house close-ups of his anxious face alternating with long shots of the vehicle coming nearer and nearer his eyes meeting those of his three terrified daughtersthe sequence comparing favorably to both Leone and Hitchcock. What follows is an unnervingly polite interrogation over a kitchen table by Nazi Jew-hunter Hans Landa played by the elegant and insinuating Christoph Waltz. As the camera begins to circle and Landa moves in for the kill and this good farmer edges ever closer to betraying the family he has bravely hidden each dramatic beat is another turn of the screw. Inglourious Basterds has two major arcs and many entertaining digressions one of which is the movies piece de resistance a furtive meeting in a cellar full of Nazis that builds and builds and builds until your head feels about to explode. The films most emotional thread features Melanie Laurent as Shosanna the lone Jewish escapee of that farm who forges a new identity managing a Paris cinema. That puts a movie marquee at the actions heart with additional chambers for Diane Kruger as a German leading lady whos the Basterds chief contact (and so much sexier than she was as Helen of Troy) and Michael Fassbender (who starved himself as Bobby Sands in Hunger) as a British commando whos also a Weimar cinema scholar and (glory be) film critic. (Hes briefed on his Paris mission by Mike Myers as a pip-pip English general and a gnomish Rod Taylor as Churchill.) As Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) attempts to finance his own nationalist German cinema the Basterds and Shosanna (on separate tracks) scheme to use his delusions of David O. Selznick grandeur to send him and Hitler (Martin Wuttke) to that Leni Riefenstahl mountain in the sky. I wont attempt to diagram the narrative which Tarantino devised over the course of a decade and has the where-the-fuck-did-that-come-from aspect of David Lynchs mystifying but great Mulholland Drive. (Its not based on the 1978 war film from which Tarantino borrowedand cheekily misspelledthe title.) I will say that Inglourious Basterds builds to a hectic movie-premiere climax in which Shosanna plans to substitute her own film for a Goebbels-produced one starring Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) a real Nazi hero recreating onscreen his valorous feat. So you have a Nazi myth exploded by a subversive Jewish countermyth contained within a Tarantino revenge myth that rewrites history in ways that make your jaw drop. Sadly Tarantino isnt up to that phantasmagorical finale which carries the onscreen title Revenge of the Giant Face. Its choppy and labored and both the action and Pitts performance drift into camp. Yet it gets by (just) on sheer audacity. Tarantino is nutty enough to believe myth can trump historythat no Fuhrer can survive the bloody onslaught of an exploitation auteur. Inglourious Basterds is a revenge movie in which the movie itself is the best revenge. Next weeks issue is our annual Fall Preview which means sadly no movie column.

By David Denby Brad Pitt as an officer and Diane Kruger as a spy in Quentin Tarantinos movie.   Credit Illustration by John Ritter In Quentin Tarantinos ""Inglourious Basterds""--an extravagant jest about the Second World War--Joseph Goebbels commissions a propaganda combat film and assembles the Nazi leaders in occupied Paris in 1944 for its premiere at a lovely Art Deco theatre. As the big night approaches groups of European movie people and Jewish American soldiers plot to use the occasion to eliminate the Nazi command and bring an end to the Third Reich. (Some plan to set fire to the theatre others to blow it up.) The anti-Nazi cinemaphiles include the female theatre owner; her black lover and projectionist; a leading German actress who spies for the British; and of all people a critic--an English expert on German cinema who attempts to pass himself off as an S.S. officer. The Americans are themselves right out of the movies the Inglourious Basterds as they are known are a kind of Jewish Dirty Dozen led by a Gentile Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) a blunt jawjutting tough guy from Tennessee (which is where Tarantino is from). In brief Tarantino has gone past his usual practice of decorating his movies with homages to others. This time he has pulled the film-archive door shut behind him--theres hardly a flash of light indicating that the world exists outside the cinema except as the basis of a nutbrain fable. Since 1941 the Basterds have been killing German soldiers in occupied France sometimes by beating them with a baseball bat. Then they scalp them (the explanation Raine has Native American blood). The lieutenant also carves swastikas into Nazi foreheads. Whether the Basterds are Tarantinos ideal of an all-American killing team or his parody of one is hard to know. Very little in ""Basterds"" is meant to be taken straight but the movie isnt quite farce either. Its lodged in an uneasy nowheresville between counterfactual pop wish fulfillment and trashy exploitation between exuberant nonsense and cinema scholasticism. In the middle of this crazy narrative Tarantino pauses to pay his respects like an unctuous film professor to the immortals of German cinema. The great G. W. Pabst Emil Jannings (They are brought to Paris for the premiere.) The cinema it seems is both innocent and heroic; it creates great art and it will end the war. The fire is started by the burning of old nitrate-based movies behind the screen. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is not boring but its ridiculous and appallingly insensitive--a Louisville Slugger applied to the head of anyone who has ever taken the Nazis the war or the Resistance seriously. Not that Tarantino intends any malice toward such earnest people. The Nazis for him are merely available movie tropes--articulate monsters with a talent for sadism. By making the Americans cruel too he escapes the customary division of good and evil along national lines but he escapes any sense of moral accountability as well. In a Tarantino war everyone commits atrocities. Like all the directors work after ""Jackie Brown"" the movie is pure sensation. Its disconnected from feeling and an eerie blankness--its too shallow to be called nihilism--undermines even the best scenes. At the beginning for example in 1941 an S.S. patrol led by Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) questions a French farmer about a family of Jews who may be hiding on his property. The scene is methodically staged. Colonel Landa is polite even flirtatious and Tarantino increases the tension gradually shooting and editing the confrontation with classical rigor. Landa promises the farmer--a man of great dignity--that he will protect his family if he turns over the Jews which he finally does though unwillingly. They are hiding under the floorboards and Landas men shoot all of them except for a young woman Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) who disappears into the countryside. (We meet her again later as the owner of the Paris theatre.) Does Landa keep his promise and allow the farmers family to survive? The scene ends and Tarantino doesnt say. His refusal to show us how events play out comes across as sheer negligence or indifference. Moral callousness has been part of Tarantinos style in the past. In ""Pulp Fiction"" his merry roundelay set among Los Angeles lowlifes the aggressive acts that the characters commit against one another are so abrupt and extreme that they become funny. The movies outrageous panache gave the audience license to enjoy the violence as lawless entertainment. But in ""Basterds"" Tarantino is mucking about with a tragic moment of history. Chaplin and Lubitsch played with Nazis too but they worked as farceurs using comedy to warn of catastrophe; they didnt carve up Nazis using horror-film flourishes. Tarantinos hyper-violent narrative reveals merely that he still daydreams like a teen-ager. It should be said however that the scenes set in Paris in which Tarantino imagines the formal but abrasive nature of social life among the Nazi elite are all beautifully designed (by David and Sandy Wasco) and photographed (by Robert Richardson). The director has also given prominence to a good actor new to American audiences the Austrian-born Christoph Waltz who as Landa exudes the kind of insinuating menace characteristic of Nazis in old Warner Bros. movies. The role may be a cliche but Waltz is brilliant in it; he takes an intellectual pleasure in devilry. The film is skillfully made but its too silly to be enjoyed even as a joke. Tarantino may think that he is doing Jews a favor by launching this revenge fantasy (in the burning theatre working-class Jewish boys get to pump Hitler and Goring full of lead) but somehow I doubt that the gesture will be appreciated. Tarantino has become an embarrassment his virtuosity as a maker of images has been overwhelmed by his inanity as an idiot de la cinematheque. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a hundred and fifty-two minutes long but Tarantinos fans will wait for the directors cut which no doubt shows Shirley Temple arriving at Treblinka with the Glenn Miller band and performing a special rendition of ""Baby Take a Bow"" from the immortal 1934 movie of the same name before she fetchingly leads the S.S. guards to the gas chamber. Julia Child in ""The French Chef""--her first TV series which began in 1963--was amazingly quick. Moving her pots and pans and little bowls of chopped onions and clarified butter around the counter she might have been a three-card-monte player in Times Square. American home cooks may have mastered Childs recipes but her hands in their sureness and speed were unmatchable by anyone but a pro. Child was strong in so many ways and her absence of fear and self-consciousness allowed her to express a good cheer and a satisfaction in life that even a five-year-old could feel. Her verbal style in its high-pitched insistence may have resembled that of a Boston dowager but she was a Californian from Pasadena and probably spoke that way naturally not as a cultural inheritance but as an irreducible expression of self. She was incapable of modern irony. In ""Julie amp; Julia"" Nora Ephron who wrote and directed and her star Meryl Streep push the mannerisms a bit. They have to--the comic possibilities are irresistible. The filmmakers mounted Streep on platform heels stretched her out and put her together with the compact Stanley Tucci (as Childs loving husband Paul). Like a tall ship in full sail Streep leans tilts and billows. Odd explosions of air--whoops exclamations--come hurtling through the passageways. She runs out of breath and then settles mysteriously like an old Bible that italicizes ordinary words on a single syllable. Its all extremely funny but Ephron and Streep stop short of camp. They know that theres no way anyone can make or would want to make Julia Child look second-rate. The movie alternates between Childs story as a restless American in Paris in the nineteen-fifties longing to write a cookbook and the adventures in Queens in 2002 of a lost young American wife (Amy Adams) who sets out to replicate Childs recipes--a structure that is more a rhyming device than a dramatic idea. Yet it works well enough to hold together a dual fable of driving ambition and anxious discipleship. ""Julie amp; Julia"" is one of the gentlest most charming American movies of the past decade. Its subject is less food as something to cook than food as the binding and unifying element of dinner parties friendship and marriage. Manners and sociability obsess Nora Ephron How did a happy middle-aged couple like the Childs speak to each other sixty years ago? How does that compare with the way a young couple speak now? And the director exploits a neat little joke--the formal and serene Childs have a hot sex life while the hip young couple hardly make love at all. The miracle of the Childs marriage was that food was never the main course. It was more like a perpetual appetizer.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

So its perhaps unnecessary to point out that the blithe misspellings ? in the movies title are a delirious touch of nonsense too -- ?the whim of a filmmaker whos a bit of a renegade himself. Still I start with the title since so too does Tarantino. His orthographic choices seem to say Love me love my idiosyncrasies -- fun with words is only a hint of the coming attractions. (Trivia experts in the QT movie clubhouse know that Inglorious Bastards properly spelled is the American title of a 1978 B-minus Italian war movie with only the loosest of plot connections to this loopy homage.) Few young-to-middle-aged American filmmakers have the nerd-centric depth of movie knowledge and technique that Tarantino brings to his high-flying projects and fewer still have the confidence to simultaneously glorify and deconstruct genre as he can whether the genre is blaxploitation Hong Kong action 70s grindhouse fare or in this case war movies and 40s noir. But Tarantinos gleefully assembled spectacles are? inextricable from his frustrating emotional limitations Everything is ?a game. And here the game includes spelling and the actorly imitation of ""people"" in ""trouble."" And Nazis. Or should I say ""NAH-zeees""? Thats what Lieut. Aldo Raine (Pitt) calls them as he handpicks a team ?of cocky malcontents -- most of them Jewish -- to join him in accumulating Nah-zee scalps. (Literally Each man is assigned a quota of 100.) Pitt in a 40s-style toothbrush-bristle mustache undertakes Raines preposterous speechifying in an accent just east of a George W. Bush drawl; he also pulls his lower lip up in a cornpone approximation of Monty Pythons Mr. Gumby. Among those who cowboy up for Raines regiment is Hostel ?director Eli Roth as ""the bear Jew"" a baseball-bat-wielding lug who smashes his enemies heads to a pulp. You can watch since QT is always up for a lavishly designed shot of brain splatter. As is his preference Tarantino builds his movie as a collage of interlocking set piece -- cinematically dazzling to be sure ? enhanced by an meticulously chosen retro soundtrack -- rather than a linear progression. As a result its easy enough to tune out the Basterds while they scalp up a storm and drop in instead on other colorful players. As Bridget a German actress and undercover agent with exquisite taste in footwear Diane Kruger presides over a conversation-rich scene in a pub populated with good guys and bad. As French-Jewish Shosanna who witnesses the slaughter of her family forges a new identity opens a movie theater and plots revenge Melanie Laurent presides over a climactic blowout -- literally -- in her Cinema Paradiso of a movie palace. (At the Cannes premiere this line ?of Shosannas killed ""Were French. We respect directors in our country."") And as Nazi colonel Hans Landa nicknamed ""the Jew hunter"" for obvious and terrible ? reasons Austrian actor Christoph Waltz ? triumphs heroically over Tarantinos brash cine-drunk tall tale. His Landa makes a ? magnetic entrance in the movies first (and very best) scene terrifying a French farmer suspected of hiding Jews simply by requesting a glass of milk. Waltz who easily won the 2009 Cannes prize for best actor centers Inglourious Basterds with the welcome subtlety of his performance. In Tarantinos besotted historical reverie real-life villains Adolf Hitler and ?Joseph Goebbels are played as grotesque jokes. The Basterds are played as exaggeratedly tough Jews. The women are femmes fatales.? In such a cartoon world the appearance of one stereotype-resistant protagonist -- a Nazi no less -- counts as something glorious indeed.

Its needlessly long and prone to kitschy detours--check out that strudel--that veer us away from his explosive intent. But this flawed film is a bravura of perversity a war flick that uses our worst instincts against us and where the applause when the good guys win rings as hollow as hoots at a dog fight. The bulk of story takes place in 1944 three years after Aldo the Apache (Brad Pitt) and his squad of eight Jewish killers arrived in Europe resolved to scalp 100 Nazis each. Aldos men have clear cause  to fight; as for the Tennessee hillbilly himself his reasons are unspecified though the inch-thick scar around his neck implies he doesnt play well with strangers. To them a good Nazi is a dead Nazi. But that sounds less ass-kicking awesome than youd expect since a German officer named Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) aka ""The Jew Hunter"" made the same sweeping argument about the Jews in the scene just before. Tarantino isnt trying to undermine the horror of the Holocaust. Hes trying to do something trickier that few people want to hear remind us that personal tragedy is unswayed by politics. ""Most German soldiers are somebodys son"" yelps a captured SS man when Aldo and his Basterds order him to give up the hiding spots of the German troop one orchard over. He wont betray his men and so hes doomed to get his skull bashed in by the ""Bear Jew"" a feared legend who turns out to be utterly mundane--a baseball bat-wielding twerp from Boston (Eli Roth). This scene has all the cruelty and bravery of a classic World War II flag-waver but here the Yanks are the thugs and the ill-fated German officer could be played by Gregory Peck. Even Hans the Jew Hunter commands respect and--against our will--even admiration. Hes smarter than the Basterds. And more charming too. Waltz who won Best Actor at Cannes for the role plays him debonairly. Hes what people once called ""continental"" full of delight for small pleasures suave and alert unbalancing his prey with his good manners even as he studies them for betrayal. By contrast Hitler (Martin Wuttke) is a vainglorious brat in a cape and Aldo just a hick with a knife. Pitt plays him like a cartoon but I still cant look away from him on screen--less and less because hes ridiculously handsome but because hes one of the only modern actors whose body language doesnt apologize for being in front of the camera. Even when sitting he sits with a purpose; his confidence is irresistible. Tarantino has described the film as a spaghetti western under the Nazi empire and hes packed the film with flourishes like songs that layer ""Fur Elise"" over Ennio Morricones galloping guitars and shots lifted straight from an intro class on John Ford as when Hans takes aim at a fleeing Jewish girl from inside a French farmhouse. Of course Tarantino isnt a man who limits himself to only one influence--theres rap on the soundtrack Luis Bunuel in his set pieces blaxploitation in his humor and five different fonts in his opening credits alone. In case we forget to be aware of the man behind the camera he puts a panting black poodle in the foreground of a long scene at a restaurant (his favorite set piece). Half of his scenes could be cut in half--doubling the impact of the film--but while Im not going to agree with Tarantino that his meanderings serve a purpose Ill swallow them down if hell keep making movies. (Even if I fast-forward through them like I do with Deathproof.) The comedy often makes Basterds feel like a prank but its vital and even-handed in its cruelty. The Nazis are brutes but the Allies arent much better--and while were all bursting to make the argument that at least the Allies were killing to prevent more killing no one on the screen says it for us or even alludes to the camps and their fears for their Jewish relatives still stuck in Europe. People talk about how to win the war not why. The violence here exists only in a tit-for-tat vacuum like the whole of France was just a frontier town in Arizona. The only character who lays claim to a personal reason to take down Hitler is a young Jewish girl posing as a French movie theater owner named Emmanuelle (Melanie Laurent) who saw the Germans mow down her entire family. When a German war hero named Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) becomes infatuated with Emmanuelle nee Shosanna he arranges with Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) to use her theater to host the premiere of his propagandist biography the story of the three-day sniper shootout where he killed 300 Allied soldiers. Shosanna realizes this is the perfect moment for her to avenge herself on the German heads of state--especially since Hitler is rumored to be in attendance--but she doesnt know that the Basterds along with two double agents (Diane Krueger and Michael Fassbender) have their own plot for the evening. What isnt heroism? In todays newspapers youd say strapping bombs to your legs to kill a room of mostly civilians. Tarantino doesnt ask us to question whether clear terrorist tactics are worth it to end WWII. He assumes well think they are and they might well be. But he wont make ending the war easy on us--imagine seeing a Jewish fighter spraying a crowd of German women with his machine gun. These ladies and their dates have just whooped with joy as the onscreen Zoller mowed down one soldier after another from his sniper perch--an orgy of cinematic violence were meant to see as ghoulish. Do we about face and cheer like them when its our guys holding the guns? Some in my theater did but to me it felt like they were trying to be in on a joke Tarantino isnt making. Basterds isnt a deep film--honestly what Tarantino flick is?--but it has moments as sharp as a bayonet and as perverse as war itself.

""Inglourious Basterds"" is a violent fairy tale an increasingly entertaining fantasia in which the history of World War II is wildly reimagined so that the cinema can play the decisive role in destroying the Third Reich. Quentin Tarantinos long-gestating war saga invests a long-simmering revenge plot with reworkings of innumerable genre conventions but only fully finds its tonal footing about halfway through after which its off to the races. By turns surprising nutty windy audacious and a bit caught up in its own cleverness the picture is a completely distinctive piece of American pop art with a strong Euro flavor thats new for the director. Several explosive scenes and the names of Tarantino and topliner Brad Pitt promise brawny commercial prospects especially internationally as the preponderance of subtitled dialogue might put off a certain slice of the prospective domestic audience. In no meaningful way based upon Enzo G. Castellaris schlock 1978 Italian WWII programmer of the same title Tarantinos deliberately misspelled namesake has been in the oven for many years initially as a would-be ""The Dirty Dozen""-style bad boys ""mission"" adventure and until very recently as a massive miniseries-length epic spanning the entire war. The narrow mission focus has prevailed in the end but not in the way that might have been expected as the group of Jewish avengers led by Pitts Tennessee Lt. Aldo Raine rep only one component of a vast ensemble that feeds into a Nazi-foiling plot only a hardcore film buff could have dreamed up. In fact the best characters are non-Yanks all of whom speak their own languages and one or two others to boot. But this commendable gesture toward linguistic accuracy is virtually the only realistic aspect of the picture which otherwise soars on its flights of fancy and deliberate anachronisms -- the use of David Bowies ""Putting Out the Fire"" at a crucial point is particularly inspired -- and flattens out only when Tarantino gets too carried away with over-elaborated dialogue scenes a problem that could easily be addressed with some slight trimming between now and the skedded August opening. Never less than enjoyable and more than that in the second half ""Basterds"" is divided into five ""chapters"" the first being ""Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France."" Wording not only reflects the Sergio Leone-style nature of the opening scene in which notorious Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) arrives at a farmhouse to ferret out a hidden Jewish family but honestly reflects the fantastical nature of the narrative to come. The long discussion in which Landa engages the nervous farmer establishes in slightly protracted fashion Landas erudition and his relaxed self-amused way of leading up to the lethal moment. It also provides Waltz a good-looking 40ish actor who carries off dialogue in four languages with consummate ease with an early chance to claim the picture as his own which he does. One member of the Jewish family young Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) escapes the massacre only to surface three years later in 1944 as the owner of a cinema in occupied Paris. Now a very quickly grown-up blonde Shosanna endures the unwelcome advances of Nazi war hero Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) who calls himself ""the German Sgt. York"" for his exploits at taking out dozens of Allied soldiers singlehandedly a feat celebrated in a new German movie ""Nations Pride"" starring Zoller himself. In short order Shosanna is compelled to tolerate the company of the infamous Dr. Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) as well that of Landa who informs her at length that the Nazis want to take over her theater to hold the premiere of Zollers film an event to be attended by Nazidoms elite. As difficult as it is for Shosanna to bear these monsters the event does provide the long-suffering woman the opportunity shes been waiting for to strike back at her familys killer and other Nazis in the bargain. A notable continuity issue crops up here as Shosanna is told the gala screening is to be held that very evening. In the next chapter ""Operation Kino"" a British commando leader (and former film critic) Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) is told by a general (Mike Myers amusing and greatly made-over) that the opening will take place three days hence. Quite apart from Shosannas own plot the Brits in league with the Basterds plan to infiltrate the premiere courtesy of their invaluable secret agent beauteous German leading lady Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger). Once this mission is set in motion pic clicks confidently on all cylinders. Before this point some scenes feel overly attenuated; the leisurely exchange between Landa and Shosanna in a Paris restaurant features needlessly repetitious dialogue and has a deadened airless quality due to the almost total absence of ambient sound and surrounding activity. The Basterds first appearance in which they gleefully display their grisly Nazi-scalping technique and which features much twangy down-home speechifying by Pitt also proves less amusing than was no doubt intended. By contrast a long tavern sequence in which the group of reveling spies -- including Bridget Hicox Til Schweigers renegade German and Gedeon Burkhards undercover corporal -- party on until coming under the suspicion of a Gestapo officer (August Diehl excellent) is vintage Tarantino brimming with delicious dialogue wonderful linguistic mixing lively group interplay and tension slowly built to a convulsive climax. Scene vaults the picture straight into its grand climax in which all the top Nazis including Goebbels Goerring and crazily enough Hitler himself conveniently place themselves under one roof awaiting the madly inventive fate devised for them by Shosanna. While World War II has probably inspired as much fiction as any other single topic in film history ""Inglourious Basterds"" is one of the few to have brazenly altered history to such an extent. Because he carefully sets up the approach at the outset as well as through his sense of style Tarantino gets away with it and is in a position to fine-tune the picture before locking a final cut. Other scenes ripe for pruning are all those featuring Hitler prior to the grand finale interludes that come off as cartoony unconvincing and unnecessary. In a true ensemble picture Waltz stands head and shoulders above the rest with a lusty performance in the juiciest role. Laurent is appealingly thoughtful and observant as the young lady awaiting her chance Fassbender cuts a dashing figure speaks with a wonderfully clipped accent and rather resembles Daniel Day-Lewis here and Kruger is far more engaging and animated than shes heretofore been in her big international pictures. Pitt clearly enjoys rolling his former moonshine runners accent around in his mouth although his performance is overly defined by constantly jutting jaw and furrowed brow. Inferring a measure of self-evaluation by Tarantino some viewers will take exception to the films final line in which Aldo admires his climactic bit of brutal handiwork ""I think this just might be my masterpiece."" Shot almost entirely at Babelsberg Studio outside Berlin with brief location work in Paris pic features terrific production values across the boards from David Wascos rich production design and Anna Sheppards fine costumes to Robert Richardsons clear-eyed beautifully framed lensing and Sally Menkes sharply timed editing. Tarantino eschews a traditional score in favor of a crazy stew of source music ranging eclectically from Dimitri Tiomkins ""The Green Leaves of Summer"" from ""The Alamo"" and some Mike Curb motorcycle movie music to eight selections from the Ennio Morricone library. Basterd Eli Roth shot the black-and-white battle footage from the ""Nations Pride"" film-within-a-film which features glimpses of original ""Inglorious Bastards"" star Bo Swenson.

Is there any other popular American director who like Tarantino is constantly ranting and raving about cinemas glorious past and giving young filmgoers reason to extend their DVD library back beyond Star Wars? Even the name of his new film is fondly stolen from a little known Italian movie of the 1970s. Its only when you turn to Tarantinos own films that things get more tricky. For the sad truth is that Tarantino like cheap wine just isnt improving with age.Which is an awkward reality because Tarantino obviously wants to put away childish things with this new film. Not only does Brad Pitt close the film with the self-regarding line This may well be my masterpiece but Inglourious Basterds is a little more restrained and a little more quiet than films like Death Proof and Kill Bill. I say a little because much of the film is not quiet at all when the music comes its loud; when the deaths occur theyre gruesome even sadistic; and when the plot kicks in its pure wild fantasy.The film moves liberally between French German and English dialogue and takes us through five chapters. First in 1941 we see a Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (played by Austrian Christoph Waltz) known as The Jew Hunter discover and kill a Jewish family in France; only the youngest daughter gets away. Then were introduced to the basterds a gang of eight Jewish-American soldiers who while deep undercover roam Nazi-occupied France murdering German soldiers and collecting their scalps. Theyre led by a Tennessee goodtime boy played by Pitt but oddly theyre not on screen much. Pitt is lively but he disappears for a long time and is upstaged by Waltz who gives a teasing turn of sly comedy and cruel charm. His scenes are the films best.For the films final chapters we leap to Paris in 1944 where the two stories collide. The girl who fled the Nazis Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) is now running a cinema (of course) which plays films by Riefenstahl and Pabst. A Nazi private Frederick (Daniel Bruhl) takes a shine to her. It turns out that his gun-toting heroics are being immortalised in a film produced by Goebbels who decides that Shosannas cinema is perfect for the premiere. Shosanna and the basterds decide that the screening is their chance to strike.This might be a period movie but still we clock Tarantinos signature style - the extended know-it-all dialogue the tricky gunplay the pop-cultural nods. Theres even a Mexican stand-off a la Reservoir Dogs and the obligatory nigger reference this time in French. But this lacks the stylistic pizzazz of Tarantinos best and by putting more emphasis than usual on the chatter it makes it more obvious that the talk often lacks wit and verve.Perhaps unsurprisingly Tarantino takes the history of cinema more seriously than the history of Europe. References to films abound Michael Fassbenders British spy (who has an amusing if silly Dr Strangelove-like scene with a superior played by Mike Myers) used to be a critic and regurgitates what sounds like a Wikipedia entry on German film while another character wonders whether he prefers Chaplin or the French silent actor Max Linder.Whats not clear is what Tarantino wants to achieve Inglourious Basterds is an immature work that doesnt know whether its a pastiche a spoof a counterfactual drama a revenge tragedy or a character comedy. How can we within a space of minutes feel adult sympathy for a hunted Jewish family and then childish glee when a Nazis skull is crushed with a baseball bat? The one cancels out the other. But perhaps the biggest faux pas is introducing real historical characters. Tarantinos inventions are big enough - not least Waltzs terrific movie Nazi - so why does he have to court implausibility by dragging in a loony Hitler (Martin Wuttke nothing special) and introducing Goebbels? You might imagine too that this film was written in the 60s Tarantino seems blithely uninterested in more than 60 years of slow reconciliation between Europe and its past.Subtle is not a word in Tarantinos lexicon. At the films heart is a fatal attempt to conflate fact with fiction and a celebration of vengeance thats misplaced and embarrassing. Loyal fans expecting a familiar patchwork of Tarantino tics and quirks - Pulp History or Kill Hitler - might not be disappointed. Those expecting anything approaching progress cinematically or ideologically probably will be.

Sure pretty much everybody is going to complain about the historical innacuracy. But really kids. Just sit back and watch the movie and base your opinion of the movie on the movie not the history. And second of all the people complaining about showing these murderous Ally soldiers just please be quiet. Because I know that you wouldnt be complaining if he were showing the Nazis like that(And you arent because he did indeed show that). In the end a movie is a movie and as for the film itself Tarantino pulls off some really neat shots. The scene in the bar is fantastic and found myself going back to see exactly who shot who. The scene is most definitely not realistic but it is put together very very well. And like Tarantino said isnt really a film about war its a film about films.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 12 2010RicoFeaturedTime Out London reviewer got this right whereas so many other reviews were positive.

I dont know what film these Tarantino lovers watched that touted it as his best picture since Pulp Fiction - I myself as a Tarantino lover thought it was his worst. The dialogue is weak the story is weak the fantasy history is just going to dumb a younger audience down...the cast was weak with the only standout being ""The Jewhunter"" Nazi. WEAK WEAK WEAK Doesnt compare to any of his previous films. Even Death Proof was better and thats saying alot. I can tell how tastes and culture are definitely deteriorating in America by the rave reviews this movie has gotten and is getting on these comments.

There were a few saving graces C Waltz was excellent as the Jew Hunter as was MA(c)lanie Laurent as the cinema owner. Both easily out-performed Pitt.

The end is a stroke of genius in that it simply allows the audience to believe that Hitler was assassinated even though we know he wasnt.

All in all a WWII set Western movie hystorically inaccurate  so it is. Characters are wonderfully depicted with the possible exception of the hystorical ones; acting is on average very good with a superb Waltz shining above everyone else. Plot is decent even though linear with some not really convincing twists. Its weak spots are probably a cetain lack of unit and sense of flow and the inappropriate use of quite inconsistent hystorical characters All of the rest is there; you got the action the killing and the endless talking parts (please DONT complaint about these if you dont like them then you dont like Tarantino and shouldnt be seeing the movie). At least two great moments of cinema; the opening sequence in the farmer house and the the tavern rendez-vous. Please dont judge this movie for what is not i.e. a WWII movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 29 2009BryanFeaturedSorry this review is terrible.
