As a hyper-stylized live-action adaptation of the classic cartoon it proved especially divisive to critics and as a family-friendly follow-up to their ""Matrix"" trilogy it failed to draw audiences as well ending its domestic run with a gross just shy of 44 million. Even worldwide numbers couldnt compensate for such a shortfall. However like any good underdog ""Speed Racer"" has found its fair share of champions and when presently greeted with the sterile spectacle of a Joseph Kosinski film or the garish visuals of a Baz Luhrmann outing its actually quite easy to think that the Wachowski siblings were on the right track so to speak. For some -- hell maybe even most -- all three experiences are equally unwelcome in their aggressive luster. For me ""Racer"" easily leads the pack and not just for its shiny style... ...although thats as good a place to start as any. For all the light trails lens flares and continuous transitions crammed into each and every frame the Wachowskis brought the same clean action geography to ""Racer"" that they did to each ""Matrix"" film (and if nothing else we can all agree that ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" are at their most coherent when characters are fighting instead of talking). Each race takes place against a distinctly different setting; each location with its own unique climate and apparent architecture; each competitor assigned a motif that extended to their costumes cars and weapons. In kind Speed (Emile Hirsch anchoring an entirely game ensemble) wields his gadget-laden vehicle with increasing variety an extension of self that initially grinds and flips with all the grace of a skateboard until capable of full-on ""car-fu"" hubcap-level swordplay and defense against more medieval maces and the like. These sequences are frantic to be sure yet also fashioned with the precision and pop of a great comic-book panel. (It makes one relieved that the film didnt have to succumb to the hastily post-converted 3-D trend in the wake of the following years ""Avatar."") Of course 135 minutes of non-stop visual input is inevitably tiring -- I agree with others that the film would have been better served by Speeds refusal to join the villainous Royalton team right off the bat instead of deliberating but even the downtime between races leads more often to hand-to-hand fights than solemn speeches about doing whats right in an underhanded world. That defiantly anti-corporate stance is especially amusing given Warner Brothers repeated indulgences on part of the Wachowskis agreeing to distribute their similarly challenging ""Cloud Atlas"" last year and earning even less with it in the end. (On that note Id eagerly recommend catching up with that one as it is now available on iTunes and soon out on DVD/Blu-ray/VOD/etc.) Susan Sarandons Mom Racer even goes on to literalize the correlation by telling Speed that ""I go to the races to watch you make art."" Amid the overly earnest tone (almost) squeaky-clean humor and familiar messages about the value of teamwork and the preservation of integrity is the rare film family thats as strong at the start as they are by the end. Along similarly wholesome if obvious lines is the fact that the aptly-named Speed embodies a generation of children repeatedly recognized for their attention-deficit tendencies kids who might very well most appreciative of a movie every bit as hyperactive as they are. The different-is-okay moral of the story isnt as striking as the fact that a young Trixie only finds herself compelled to punch a snobby classmate when she calls Speed a ""retard."" Its that defense by his friends encouragement by his family and rare quiet on his own that sees Speed Racer through to the finish line and Id argue that those same qualities are what will keep ""Speed Racer"" cherished for the next five years and then some.

"Review Speed Racer rich in color poor in spirit - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Speed Racer rich in color poor in spirit Story Highlights Review ""Speed Racer"" wonderful eye candy lousy movie Colors and effects are astonishing but theres no plot no character Film is based on 1960s Japanese-made series Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- ""Speed Racer"" the Wachowski Brothers first film as writer-directors since ""The Matrix Reloaded"" five years ago is a dizzying pop-art confection. Inspired by the 1960s Japanese-made animated series the movie integrates live action and kaleidoscopic digital effects to create a highly artificial color-saturated fantasy world where race cars come equipped with retractable weaponry and battle it out like spinning tops (or the ""beyblades"" popularized by more recent manga). Twelve-year-old boys should be wowed but for the rest of us it will depend on your appetite for eye candy. ""Speed Racer"" is sweet but decidedly overlong and determinedly innocuous. Weaving between past and present with rare finesse the opening scenes establish that were entering a little boys daydream. Speed Racer (played as a kid by Nicholas Elia and subsequently by Emile Hirsch) is struggling with a math equation when his mind begins to wander. As well it might Pops (John Goodman) designs race cars and older brother Rex drives them -- brilliantly. No wonder its all Speed can think about. When Rex perishes in a crash its a foregone conclusion that Speed will follow in his tire tracks. But even as a young man he soon discovers the sports world is more complex than he imagined Hes schmoozed by the CEO of Royalton (Roger Allam) a big money corporate sponsor. When Speed rejects his offer Royalton angrily insists the sport is a sham and hell never win a race. The Wachowskis like to pay lip service to subversive ideas in their scripts (which also include ""V for Vendetta"" and rewrites on last years Nicole Kidman bomb ""The Invasion"") and on some level ""Speed Racer"" is clearly meant to have a bit of ""The Matrix"" for kids with suggestions of a paranoid postmodern fable about what Royalton calls ""the power and unassailable might of money."" Get a feel for the world of ""Speed Racer"" >> Dont Miss iReport.com What movies are you looking forward to? Mostly though the Wachowskis just get a kick out of replicating the splashy wide-eyed innocence of the anime universe which is itself an even more idealized image of the nuclear family than you find in the American cartoons that influenced the Japanese. The Racer brood extends to Speeds girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) his mischievous younger brother Spritle (Paulie Litt) the pet chimpanzee Chim Chim and even a resident mechanic Sparky (Kick Gurry). Watch Hirsch and Ricci answer questions about the film >> Although its not set in a specific time and place the environment the clothes and the language -- ""Cool beans"" -- is redolent of the sitcom suburbia that was a product of the Eisenhower years ""The Jetsons"" via Roy Lichtenstein. The way the Wachowskis shoot this world it might as well be a rear projection but its a rear projection they evidently find appealing. It is possible to feel nostalgia for a lost utopia the future we used to believe in that never quite materialized. The races are dizzying switchback affairs closer to virtual kung fu than NASCAR. The longest is a cross-country rally/demolition derby which seems indebted to another late 60s cartoon ""The Wacky Racers."" In one typically oddball gag a rival driver attempts to knock out Speed by catapulting a beehive into his path. But for all the movies visual panache -- and theres plenty -- there are precious few laughs and little suspense. Its almost impossible to care about Speed or the outcome of his races. Not because hes not heroic but because hes as synthetic as everything else in this virtual entertainment. The old cartoon was frequently silly and empty too but at least it was over in a half-hour. ""Speed Racer"" is rated PG and runs -- and runs and runs -- 135 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

Pictures Hes the hero We know because hes got the loyal girlfriend (Christina Ricci). Warner Bros. Pictures Scenes from Speed Racer A Fan Favorite Grand Prix Speed Racer looks -- and sounds -- a bit different than he did in his 1960s TV incarnation. Souped up tuned up and digitally tarted up for its big-screen big-budget debut his Mach 5 racer flips and flashes zooms and careens sparks and slides sideways leaps barriers and loops the loop cheerfully defying every law of physics youve ever heard of. Gravity? Whats that? Centrifugal force? The Second Law of Thermodynamics? (Actually I dont know much about that last one but Im confident in saying it doesnt apply here.) So how can something look so bright move so fast and be so dull? Oh right the Wachowski brothers are involved. Theyre the guys who made The Matrix then followed it up with technically sophisticated movies (V for Vendetta anyone?) notable mostly for being loud paranoid simple-minded and dark. Speed Racer marks a major change in that formula Its not dark. Its hyperbright with colors so lurid theyd vibrate even if nothing were in motion. Of course everything is in motion People standing still whoosh across the frame. Painted zebras gallop on the racetracks walls. The trick to zipping safely through all this? As all-time champ Rex Racer explains to his little brother Speed ""Close your eyes and listen."" Now thats a thought. But if you close your eyes and listen youll hear the dialogue which thuds about as often as the bad guys cars do. At least I think theyre the bad guys cars though its hard to tell at times; for all those potentially seizure-inducing visuals Speed Racer is never easy to follow even with a story that can be summed up as ""family good corporate conglomerate bad."" (This from Warner Bros. part of the worlds biggest media conglomerate.) To his credit Speed Racer himself seems unfazed by all the flash and bother. Hes played by Emile Hirsch who has previously looked uncannily like Leonardo DiCaprio but who here looks uncannily like Ray Liotta. (Which isnt really a good trade.) Hes surrounded by fine actors whose chief contribution is that they resemble the line drawings theyre replacing. Since actors perform entirely in front of green screens with everything else painted in digitally Speed Racer is really just substituting one form of animation for another. No doubt that marks a thrilling advance of some sort if youre a tech geek -- or 9 years old. If not heres hoping that -- after subjecting yourself to eyeball-lacerating visuals earsplitting sounds and mind-numbing product placement for what amounts to six back-to-back Speed Racer TV episodes at one sitting -- you dont have to drive home right away.

The Wachowskis have whipped up a 136-minute silly symphony of fluorescent colors gravity-defying car races and cartoonish villains all served up in a fluid dreamlike style as sophisticated as the storyline is aggressively childish. This is a movie aimed squarely at the family audience--if the characters names Mom Racer and Pop Racer (John Goodman and Susan Sarandon) werent tip-off enough the scene-stealing pet chimp should give you fair warning.The gifted race-car driver Speed (Emile Hirsch looking almost as lean as he did in ""Into the Wild"" but more clean-cut) is the pure sportsman in a corrupt world of fixed races dirty drivers (whose cars come equipped with lethal weapons) and multimillion-dollar corporate sponsors. Its a sign of Speeds purity that he turns down a sponsorship offer from the ruthless money-worshiping head of Royalton Industries (Roger Allam) who responds to this rebuff by threatening to ruin both Speed and his familys proudly independent Racing Motors company. Lest there be any doubt that the ""Matrix"" creators former indie filmmakers working in the heart of the studio system see this as a parable of their own careers Mom Racer tells her talented son ""Youre an artist ... What you do is beautiful and inspiring.""""Speed Racer"" creates a timeless visually seductive world suspended somewhere between the pop 60s and the sci-fi future. Its biggest disappointment strangely enough is its raison detre--the races themselves. They lack suspense. The danger of creating a videogame world where the limitless freedom of CGI replaces the laws of physics is that the competitions lack any real sense of risk. These flying flipping racing cars seemingly impervious to metal-crunching collisions belong more to the world of Tom and Jerry or the Road Runner than they do to ""The French Connection"" or ""Bullitt."" (Even the races in Pixars ""Cars"" seemed more down to earth.) ""Speed Racer"" is sweet and flashy and often fun but its thrills are oddly abstract--more esthetic than visceral. Its the colors you remember not the crashes. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Curiously enough David Mamets ""Redbelt"" tells exactly the same story as ""Speed Racer"" albeit in a style that couldnt be more different. His hero Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is another sportsman of unshakable principles a teacher of Brazilian jiujitsu forced to confront a corrupt world of fixed fights and money-grubbing mixed-martial-arts promoters. Instead of CGI Mamet prefers hand-to-hand combat and the sharp chop of his trademark macho dialogue. But his vision of the pure and the good is not far removed from ""Speed Racer""s anticorporate (and corporate-sponsored) message. Like Speed Mike is Mamets portrait of the artist battling for his integrity in a fallen world. The writer-director overloads his tricky plot with backstabbing Hollywood skullduggery--his hero is lured into the movie world when he saves the skin of a movie star (Tim Allen) in a bar fight--creating mysteries that never get satisfyingly explained in his surprisingly Hollywoodish third act. But thanks to Ejiofors wonderful performance--his easy commanding body language wordlessly convinces you of his characters nobility--and Mamets knowing take on the arcane world of Brazilian jiujitsu ""Redbelt"" never loses its muscular hold on your attention.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

This toxic admixture of computer-generated frenzy and live-action torpor succeeds in being almost simultaneously genuinely painful -- the esthetic equivalent of needles in eyeballs -- and weirdly benumbing like eye candy laced with lidocaine. ""The Matrix"" gave us the trippy pleasure of bullet time a super-slo-mo vision of the world. ""Speed Racer"" gives us the paradox of a drive time thats super-fast and all but interminable. If its target audience turns out in vast numbers well be looking at child endangerment on a global scale. The story derives from the popular Japanese animated series that first came to American TV in the late 1960s. Fast cars obsess the Racer family Speed a brilliant young driver played by Emile Hirsch; his parents Mom and Pops Racer (Susan Sarandon and John Goodman); and Speeds kid brother Spritle whos played by Paulie Litt. (Chim Chim the familys pet chimp is mainly concerned with reaction shots.) The concept of camp seems to have obsessed the Wachowski brothers. Its what Larry and Andy were shooting for in the live-action sequences but what they got is laborious comedy loads of exposition and elephantine drama interspersed with tedious lectures on Matrix-related themes -- nothing is what it seems corporations are running the world and everything is crooked. ""Thats what racing is about"" says Roger Allams Royalton the evil industrialist who runs Royalton Industries. ""It has nothing to do with cars. Its all about power and the unassailable might of money."" ENLARGE When Speed discovers the terrible truth he tells Pops ""Theyve known the winner of every Grand Prix for the last 50 years."" One of the movies many dramatic problems is that Speed makes his discovery by the end of the first hour -- ""The Matrixs"" Neo took much longer to see the light -- so there are few surprises in the events that unfold during the next 69 or so minutes. But events dont really unfold in this film; that would imply development or coherence. They burst forth to the accompaniment of keening engines and triumphalist music. (Michael Giacchinos score favors big drums blaring trombones and wailing choirs.) The storytelling is incoherent even within the animated races each of which starts at breakbrain speed and sustains it until a new plot pothole slows things down. ""Speed Racer"" is a nightmare vision of childrens entertainment. Its overstimulation as an organizing principle -- colors that call for a riot squad (who knew that pastels could be assaultive?); pacing that approaches the precipice of looniness; a moral tale -- Speeds virtue versus the racing worlds vice -- told in stentorian tones better suited to propaganda. The visual style descended from anime seeks to up the videogame ante but the movie misreads that medium too. Gamers enjoy a sense of control whether real or illusory. Audiences here must sit in passive stupefaction. ""I go to the races to watch you make art"" Speeds mother tells him ""and its beautiful inspiring everything art should be."" She lies. Its exactly what art isnt. Its chaos. What Happens in Vegas... ""What Happens in Vegas..."" should have stayed in development -- forever. This ramshackle -- and occasionally repulsive -- farce doesnt even deliver on the minimal promise of its title; most of it takes place in Manhattan. Cameron Diaz is Joy a commodities trader who gets dumped by her fiance. Ashton Kutcher is Jack a party animal with a rich father who deplores his hedonism. You know the movies in trouble from the first of its countless glib exchanges ""Youre like a son to me."" ""Dad I am your son."" You cant know unless you stick it out -- I did because I had to -- how joyless this comedy can be. Suffice it to say that when Joy and Jack meet in Las Vegas where theyve gone to lick their respective wounds they get drunk married and rich in swift succession then spend most of the movie bickering since theyre a standard-brand mismatched couple. Its hard to say what Jacks emotional age was meant to be -- Mr. Kutcher plays him like a petulant pre-schooler -- but all too clear that Ms. Diaz a gifted comedienne should not have set foot on this set. Tom Vaughan directed from Dana Foxs script which stops at nothing. IN BRIEF ""OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies"" has its moments -- more than can be said for either of the films discussed above. A French-language spoof of the James Bond genre its set in the 1950s and stars Jean Dujardin a popular French comedian who looks a bit like Steve Coogan. ""OSS 117"" makes you appreciate the Road movies of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby; Mr. Dujardin could have used sharper material and livelier foils. Still his secret agent Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath is invincibly smug occasionally smarmy and obsessed with food. If that whets your appetite hes your homme.

Young Peter Parker you got bitten by a radioactive spider which somehow enables you to bound gooily from one tall building to the next. Dr. Bruce Banner the gamma bomb you were working on exploded turning you gigantic and green and incredibly hulkish when you get angry. And you four fantastic ones exposed to cosmic rays on an outer-space voyage -- that could happen to anyone. Our hearts go out to you and all the preternatural X-men and -women cursed by chance with awesome powers. We acknowledge your mutant majesty; we bow before the superiority of the afflicted. But just once or twice wouldnt it be nice if superheroism sprang not from an external accident but from inner strength? If a person achieved greatness rather than having it thrust upon him? If he found a mission focused his energy marshalled his talents and just did it? Then his triumph would be sweet indeed the fulfilling of a resolve or a work ethic that comic-book readers or movie audiences might recognize in themselves. Hed make a hero of himself and that would be more than super. This notion of self-made heroism is the theme of the first two blockbuster movies of the summer season. We saw it last weekend when Iron Man the one where arms merchant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) builds himself a heart opened to 102 million at the domestic box office last weekend. Now comes Speed Racer based on the 60s Japanese animated TV series Mach GoGoGo. Its the new sound-and-light show from brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski who in 1999 stamped the template for high-IQ effects entertainment with The Matrix. I dont think itll do half of Iron Mans first-weekend business but its certainly got twice the visual dazzlement of that very handsome Marvel Comics movie. Like the Downey film Speed Racer is plenty satisfying in traditional action-movie terms. It boasts enough auto-erotic car-nage to make Grand Theft Auto IV seem by comparison like a junkyard jalopy. Beyond that theres the edifying display of people taking control of their own destinies by building beautiful useful machines. The heroes of Speed Racer and Iron Man could be the garage geeks who paved Silicon Valley with cybergold; or Hollywoods visual-effects alchemists translating their fantasies into pixels to create gorgeous movies like these. Iron Man and Speed Racer are tributes to practical ingenuity and manual dexterity to real American innovators like Edison and Ford Steve Wozniak and Dale Earnhardt -- to the grease monkey as genius. Speed Racer is the familiar fable of the little man fighting the big corporation the inventor vs the exploiter the young athlete whose talents would be used and abused by the establishment. In the Racer clan Pops (John Goodman) is a mechanic turned car designer. Mom (Susan Sarandon) is the familys emotional center a font of dewy wisdom. Older brother Rex (Scott Porter) is a champion racer who confides some of his Zen driving secrets to his younger brother Speed before mysteriously disappearing after a car crash. Years later Speed (Emile Hirsch) is ready to carry on the Racer tradition to win the big rallies against some formidable drivers and a rigged system. The rigger-in-chief is industry titan E.P. Arnold Royalton (Roger Allam channeling Brit pundit Christopher Hitchens as his most pompestuous) who occupies the opposite pole of plutocracy from Tony Stark. Royalton doesnt make things; he crushes people to attain ""the unassailable might of money."" Speeds victory would be one for the independent entrepreneurs (the Racers are literally a Mom-and-Pops outfit) over the-global industrial complex. Which is fine except that the Wachowskis backed by uber-producer Joel Silver and Warner Bros. are not exactly underdogs. Indeed they need vast resources to mount the lavish spectacle theyve envisioned. Lavish indeed and relentless -- a hallucinatory workout for the eyes. On his show this Monday Stephen Colbert described Speed Racer as ""the classic story of boy meets seizure-inducing lights"" and noted that to get a sense of the pictures cinema style you should ""put 80 pounds of fireworks into an industrial dryer crawl right in there with them turn it on and then light the fuse. Itll give you a good idea of the visual onslaught youll be enduring."" As usual with Colbert the humor highlighted a sneaky truth in its assaultive creativity its high-speed multilayered imagineering Speed Racer is like nothing youve ever seen. And it is gorgeous a totally designed environment that is a rich cartoonish dream non-stop Op art. You get this virtual virtuosity right from the start in a flashback that shows young Speed (Nicholas Elia) in maybe third grade bored with and addled by the test paper in front of him. Its complicated questions blur into ""blah blah blah"" as the boy loses focus; then he daydreams that it reads ""All drivers to your places please"" -- and we see a Formula One-type race as it might be animated by an eight-year-old in the corner pages of a flip book. Later as Speed reaches manhood and drives in ""real"" races the visuals get wildly sophisticated but not one smidge more realistic. If you want documentary realism the Wachowskis figuratively say go rent a Ken Burns movie. The entire film exists in another nether Never-land where standard narrative and visual decisions are dismissed as way too confining. The location of the Racers home seems to be in idyllic suburban America yet Speeds schoolteacher and classmates speak with English accents. The time never specified could be today but is emotionally the 50s or early 60s. Mom and Pops Racers three sons -- Rex Speed and the youngest Spritle (Paulie Litt) -- are each separated by about 15 years. So just never mind that Goodman 55 Sarandon 61 are more likely to be Spritles grandparents than his parents. Or that Speeds forever girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci her ivory face framed by a helmet of black hair that evokes either Louise Brooks or Moe Howard) has been taken in as a permanent boarder. Or that the other members of the clan both from the original TV series are the Australian mechanic Sparky (Kick Gurry) and a monkey named Chim Chim. Traditional movie plausibility is irrelevant in Speed Racers part retro part nextro all-artificial syntho world. The Wachowskis and production designer Owen Paterson (whos been with the brothers since The Matrix and before that dreamed up the chromatic excesses of The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert) dont want to evoke feelings so much as visualize them. When young Speed first meets young Trixie candy hearts and roses bloom around him illuminating his innocent ardor. The color scheme of the Racer home evokes Pee-wees Playhouse in its cartoon cheeriness and the decor is pure 50s Populuxe. Even the choice of wallpaper -- cheery flowers in the kitchen a tangle of rectangles for Rexs room -- will have you smiling; it reinforces the sunny mid-century mood of the last decade when family wasnt a dirty word or a politically divisive one. In The Matrix the brothers hid allusions to the Bible Greek mythology and mathematics. If theres any complex philosophy in Speed Racer it went over my head (probably at the speed of light). Here the texture is the text and its deliriously dense with more than 2000 effects shots often layered on top of each other. The effect if you get into it isnt just a store window of technology. It is as Mom says of Speeds mastery behind the wheel ""inspiring and beautiful and everything art should be."" Thats what the Wachowskis are aiming for and I think what theyve achieved. In the big races no actual car was used; these magnificent set pieces are almost totally animated. The races arent just 200 miles of left turns; the tracks are designed as crazy theme-park rides with 360 loops chasm-wide broken tracks roads that wind around mountains and across rivers. The autos skid sideways and fly over other cars on stilts. In a reference to the Ben-Hur chariot race they brandish hubcap spear hooks to disable their opponents vehicle. And since the rallies take place in Virtual World theres no fretting about the waste of fuel. All of Speed Racer is a holiday not only from the gas tax but from gas. In devising this mach (or mock) world the Wachowskis desktop dervishes invented so many new techniques they had to create a bunch of new names for them. As effects supervisor John Gaeta itemizes them in the forthcoming book The Art of Speed Racer ""Faux lensing toward a Photo Anime film format (including designer shape de-focus infinite depth of field bling and super-bling flare enhancements and candy-inspired Techno Color)."" You can tell that everyone had liberated fun making the film; it feels like the group effort of Mensa kids let loose in the paint store. More than the story of the Racer family Speed Racer is the visual autobiography of the Wachowskis and their pit crew of computer-nerd Einsteins using the tools of their trade to transform the movie medium. Movies like Polar Express and Sin City proffered seductive experiments in digital cinema and green screen but Speed Racer announces the arrival of the virtual movie. If you watch the film overwhelmed by the assault of seductive visual information and wonder what youre seeing heres the happy answer the future of movies. And the people who made it? Theyre the industrys can-do-anything superheroes. Not Spider-Men not Hulks or X-Men. No Speed Demons.

"Speed Racer Colour-saturated flick | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsSpeed Racer Colour-saturated flick Speed Racer opens with the young boy Speed sitting in a classroom drawing pictures of exploding vehicles making engine-like noises and fantasizing about driving in a race.Emile Hirsch is in the drivers seat as Speed in Speed Racer which hits theatre on May 9 2008.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. May 9 2008 Speed Racer (out of 4)Starring Emile Hirsch Susan Sarandon Christina Ricci Matthew Fox Roger Allam John Goodman. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski. 129 minutes. At major theatres. PG Speed Racer opens with the young boy Speed sitting in a classroom drawing pictures of exploding vehicles making engine-like noises and fantasizing about driving in a race. Before we know it were in the equivalent of that fantasy the boys daydream spread across the big screen with all the technological wizardry Hollywood is capable of.The first effort from the Wachowski brothers since their The Matrix trilogy Speed Racer is inspired by the 1960s Japanese anime TV series. And the movie never gets far away from that feeling of a pre-adolescent racetrack daydream.Speed is the younger brother of Rex a driver who competes against cars backed by an evil corporation - until he disappears and is presumed dead.The movie quickly moves ahead to the point where Speed (Emile Hirsch) is now grown up and a race car driver for real bent on avenging his brothers death.Against the opposition of his father Pops (John Goodman) who manufactures racing cars with the help of an ace mechanic and who fears another family fatality Speed enters a brutal cross-country car race and then makes a climactic appearance in the Grand Prix.Here we have the hoariest of formulae - an innocent opposed by sneering villains in a contest of skill and courage - brought to life with the most technically sophisticated avant-garde post-ironic touches.Such contradictions in the movie abound. This is a futuristic video- game world in which Speeds mother (Susan Sarandon) known only as Mom still makes pancakes for her familys breakfast and uses her womans touch to calm down Pops.(The movie does nod to feminism when Speeds girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) takes over the wheel for a brief time.)Technology in this world may advance but a young man still has to prove hes a man. Speed gets conflicting advice in this regard. Royalton the corporate genius (Roger Allam) tells him ""Are you ready to put away your toys and grow up?"" By toys he presumably means comic books video games racing cars and even movies like Speed Racer. Pops on the other hand seems to think his son can keeps his toys as long as he uses them properly.""I saw my son become a man"" he proclaims at the end of the movie. ""I saw him act with courage and integrity and drive the pants off all the other racers on the road.""Lest anybody think racing is just an amusement for the masses Speed tells Royalton ""For Pops it isnt just a sport its way more important than that. Its like a religion. In our house major sponsors are like the devil."" If religion isnt a serious enough comparison how about art?""I go to the races to watch you make art"" Mom tells Speed. ""And its beautiful and inspiring and everything that art should be.""There is no necessity for anybody to take this seriously. More interesting is what on earth the Wachowski brothers are up to with this bombardment of the viewers eardrums and retinas with noises colours and lights. The racing sequences are almost unwatchable at times like a flickering series of subliminal stimuli.The colours are certainly gorgeous right down to the bright red lipstick of the women. The flashing blues reds and yellows are reminiscent of the interiors of gambling casinos. Like these interiors the movie is totally cut off from the ""real"" world. We see mountains and deserts during the cross-country race but they are clearly CGI products with comic book touches added such as a vulture perched on a peak. We see the spires and towers of a futuristic city but we have no idea of the time and place of this film.What is completely familiar is the overwhelming impression of speed. Its not just the racing cars. ""Our vertically integrated plant is the fastest in the world"" boasts Royalton.In its complete artificiality its embrace of cartoon images its abolition of distance and perspective through constant instantaneous movement the movie seems poised to say something about the world we live in. It seems about to reflect back to us our actual experience. It seems to suggest we are all speed racers.The movie unfortunately doesnt make that leap from sensation to art but it suggests fascinating possibilities for moviemakers interested in using the latest techniques seriously to explore the world - the fairyland we have made with our technology.

By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Speed Racer click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Emile Hirsch as Speed in Speed Racer Rather than attempt a linear summation of the sensory blitzkrieg that is the Wachowski brothers Speed Racer (Warner Bros) its best to set the humbler goal of an experiential viewing diary. You walk in to the blistering strains of a soundtrack by the usually wonderful Michael Giacchino who scored Ratatouille last year. Amid a frantic cacophony the cheery theme of the original Japanese cartoon series occasionally melancholically surfaces. Before your eyes have adjusted to the dark youre launched pinball-style into a futuristic multidimensional space (though not shot in 3-D the movie uses digital deep focus to create a similar effect) in which many many things are happening at once. A race-car driver named Speed (Emile Hirsch) is hurtling around a track that seems to bend and shudder like a Mobius strip of animate licorice as swirls of 80s album art colors--fuchsia orange teal--hover and blink in the background (or is that the foreground?). Shapes hurtle toward you then recede abruptly each bearing some fragment of narrative information that has now passed you by forever. Nausea and anxiety begin to wash over you in overlapping waves. Narrowing your eyes against the strobe effect you make out three movie stars John Goodman Susan Sarandon and Christina Ricci cheering Speed on from the impossibly vast stands that rise up from the racetrack (so vast they recall footage of Nazi rallies but no time to think about that now). This must be Speeds family Pops Racer the master mechanic; Mom Racer the proud enabler of boyish mayhem; and Trixie the spunky bob-haired girlfriend. The Racers are accompanied inevitably and dispiritingly by Speeds little brother Spritle (Paulie Litt) and his pet chimpanzee Chim Chim who will mark every major transition in the movie with painful mugging. All the flesh-and-blood actors (even the chimp) plug gamely away at their flimsy roles but the claustrophobia of acting against a green screen is palpable and theyre upstaged by their digitized backgrounds. Advertisement Piloting his vehicle at impossible speeds up banked curves Speed remembers--or is he hallucinating?--the last race of his brother Rex Racer (Scott Porter) who gave his life for the sport years ago. Speed races for Rex who once told him (in an elaborately filmed flashback that seems to rotate 360 degrees around Speeds helmeted head) to ""listen to the car."" After he breaks his brothers record Speed is approached by a nefarious racing tycoon Royalton (Roger Allam) a look- and sound-alike for Slates own Christopher Hitchens (who come to think of it would make a great movie villain). Royalton wants Speed to dump the family business and come drive for his faceless corporation. When Speed politely declines Royalton torments him (and us) with 10 minutes of exposition on the history of the World Racing League now a corrupt federation capable of ensuring Speed never wins a race again. Other stuff continues to happen until you finally get to leave the movie theater chartreuse pinwheels burned into your retinas. Speed enters a big cross-country race against his parents wishes joining forces with a Japanese driver Taejo (Korean pop singer Rain). A masked driver Racer X (Matthew Fox) may be either a double agent investigating fixed racing or a stooge for the bad guys. There are battles with ninjas drives straight up the sides of ice cliffs and at least one incident of airborne monkey poo. The rotating-camera flashback technique makes some sense narratively--when you think about something in the past that thought describes a kind of circle ending back in the present. But whats with the Wachowskis obsession with the wipe--that transitional device whereby an element from one shot moves across the screen ""wiping"" it clean for the next? Theres a wipe for wipes sake nearly every 30 seconds in Speed Racer A characters profile a champagne bucket a spray-paint gun all come in handy as screen-wipers at one point or another. The overuse of this trick evokes the following responses First time Cool Second time So? The next 78 times Why God why? Why indeed? The Wachowski brothers couldnt really have intended this Starburst-hued assault on all that is holy as a homage to the pleasingly dorky old Speed Racer cartoon with its flat planes chalky colors and stiffly drawn tableaux (not to mention the lousy dubbing in the English version). Watching the old Speed Racer induced a state of Zen focus not because so much was happening but because so little was. The state of mind brought on by Speed Racer the movie is more akin to that phenomenon by which young infants exposed to more stimuli than their systems are equipped to handle will simply shut down. Lovers of crypto-mystical paradox that they are the Wachowskis will perhaps appreciate that their first post-Matrix attempt to blow moviegoers minds has instead provided us all with this summers loudest brightest and most expensive opportunity for a nap.

Its the latest thing in blockbusters. The Wachowski brothers (""The Matrix"") fill the movie with so many new ideas about how to make pictures that it soon becomes fun just to watch those ideas whiz by even the bad ones. All the same if this action extravaganza represents the future of movies its going to be a sad dead and awful future. The proposition at work here is whether its possible to make a movie almost entirely out of flash commotion and bursts of color. The Wachowskis dont come close to proving it but they try harder than anyone has ever tried. They take some empty source material - a visually stilted emotionally stunted cartoon from a generation ago - and stuff it with the best actors they can get and the splashiest effects they can devise. They turn actors into puppets and cinema into a video game. Its ghastly but they do it on a grand scale. The fact is like the toxic gas suspended over a northern New Jersey sunrise poison can be beautiful. Its gorgeous here The live action is fed through some computer process so that every visual pops out. Red is the dominant color but not just red but a candy apple red thats so bright and vivid it all but jumps off the screen and sits in your lap. In an early scene the young Speed rides in a car with his older brother. The upholstery is red and the sky is a mix of unearthly dark blue sky and white clouds. Its so pretty that for a minute it doesnt matter what theyre saying. The experience is like walking into your first carnival. This cant last but the opening shows what the Wachowskis wanted to do not for a minute but for a whole movie to pound the audience into a delighted stupor. To give people a bacchanalian feast of sights and sounds with a mere handful of straight scenes for audiences to purge their senses in preparation for the next orgy. Ultimately the experiment fails in that the experience becomes numbing not energizing. But when a movie can make even a bottle of peanut butter look beautiful - and when whole sequences feel like you just put on new glasses after years of being nearsighted - thats something. Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is a racing prodigy with a tight family a mom played by Susan Sarandon and a dad played by John Goodman not to mention a little brother with a chimpanzee. Speed has a big-eyed girlfriend named Trixie (Christina Ricci) and the sight of Ricci trying to emulate the mannerisms of a cartoon character is one of the more disturbing things in movies this year. That she does it well - Ricci does everything well - makes it only worse. What a constrained and dreadful conformity for a vibrant and eccentric talent. The central conflict of ""Speed Racer"" is that a corrupt billionaire tycoon Royalton (Roger Allam) wants Speed to race for him. Speed wont do it and so the tycoon sets out to destroy Speed and his family. Speeds only recourse is to work his magic on the racetrack and so there are lots of racing scenes. Lots and lots and lots of racing scenes. Cars fly flip drive up the side of icy mountains do cartwheels and burst into flames. These scenes come close to straight-up animation but theyre more like watching a video game - not like playing a video game but like watching other people play and for a very long time. Theres a scene in which one cars tire has a sword and another cars tire has a shield and the two tires duel as the cars race down a mountain road. If that sounds entertaining boy have I got a movie for you. Along the way the Wachowskis come up with new things. In one sequence several drivers are talking to each other as they race. Rather than cut to each of them the Wachowskis more or less lift them from the background into the foreground as though maximizing a computer window each time one speaks. Thats an ugly technique but something else similar is much better Instead of cutting to people commenting on the action they sometimes just show their heads floating across the screen as they speak. At one point several heads crowd the frame each making comments all of them voices in Speeds head intruding on his peace. Its not a bad way to convey that idea. Yet in the end most of what the Wachowskis devise is used to ill effect. Who needs to see an actor standing at the center of a blue screen with stands of animated fans cheering in his direction? That looks as fake as old-time rear projection and in about 15 minutes it will seem just as old-fashioned too. Theres a scene in which Speeds mother (Sarandon) comforts him by saying that what he does ""behind the wheel has nothing to do with business"" but that hes truly an artist. The irony is that every actor in this movie is just collecting a check. Speed may be all about art but ""Speed Racer"" is all about commerce. Yet someday real artists may come along to use some of the techniques that the Wachowskis are developing. Then things will get interesting. -- Advisory Sensitive viewers easily disturbed by animated car crashes should be cautioned. Speed Racer Action. Starring Emile Hirsch John Goodman Christina Ricci and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski. (PG. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.

(PG) Warner Bros. (135 min.) Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski. With Emile Hirsch Christina Ricci. Now playing in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS I know the Hulk the Dark Knight Indy Jones a Mummy some cartoon Clones and a couple of X-Files agents have yet to make their appearance. But Im willing to bet right now that no summer fan-boy adventure will be as visually dazzling -- and dizzying -- as ""Speed Racer."" The film mixes live action and CGI neon colors and old-fashioned animation. Huge closeups move across the screen like cardboard cut-outs race cars whiz by on upside-down Hot Wheels tracks high-speed tunnel chases explode in kaleidoscopic imagery -- go Speed Racer go Except after an hour you may be thinking -- stop Speed Racer stop. WARNER BROS.Emile Hirsch is the stalwart man behind the wheel in ""Speed Racer."" Or at least slow down. Theres no argument that ""Speed Racer"" -- as made by the Wachowski brothers the team behind three ""Matrix"" movies and the guiding force in ""V for Vendetta"" -- is an astonishingly innovative visual feast thats sure to surprise any serious student of movies. Like few other modern American films perhaps -- Oliver Stones sometimes hallucinogenic ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Nixon"" Ang Lees much-maligned ""Hulk"" -- ""Speed Racer"" breaks and remakes the rules of composition and editing to tell its story in a different way. Its problem is the story itself. I will happily admit that ""Speed Racer"" was my favorite cartoon the first time the Japanese import showed up on American TV. Of course I was 10 at the time. Back then I also liked Apple Jacks Fresca and Eerie magazine. But if Im going to sit through ""Speed Racer"" now there has to be a little more to it. That doesnt mean the movie has to give Speed a speed problem or make Trixie turn tricks. But it has to -- as the best superhero movies have done -- find a hint of something adult in the childhood pleasure. It has to discover something that was there all along and let us rediscover it now. Anything less is just a little pathetic -- like a middle-aged man sitting on the teeter-totter. And ""Speed Racer"" is just one big playground. To be fair its clearly intentional -- the Wachowskis dont want to update the old material as much as faithfully recreate it. So every tiny detail of the classic anime cartoon is here -- from the dreadfully annoying brat with the beanie to the mischievous chimp in the overalls -- along with the not-so-mysterious mystery of that masked antihero Racer X. Its high camp approached with the reverence due holy writ. But there are no characters here the way Peter Parker lived and breathed in the first ""Spider-Man"" or Tony Stark had an eccentric interior life in ""Iron Man."" There are just the same cartoons. That John Goodman and Susan Sarandon each manage a minute or two of real emotion as Speed Racers parents is only a tribute to them. As Speed Emile Hirsch looks intent and grips the steering wheel. As devoted girlfriend Trixie Christina Ricci -- who hasnt been in a big mainstream movie for years -- looks a little astonished. As for the rest of the cast -- well if they ever see a hungry person approaching them with two slices of rye and a jar of mustard theyd be well-advised to run. It would be nice to say that the Wachowskis have finally harnessed their fabulously kinky style -- a few brief elements of transvestism excepted -- to make a family movie. Except thats not quite true. Theres an awful lot of violence for a PG movie (not to mention one character giving a one-fingered salute) and the initial flashbacks are bound to confuse. And then of course theres the length designed to tax patience and bladders. ""Speed Racer"" is brilliantly photographed and edited. Its told in a literally visionary style full of innovation and breathtaking risk. But when it comes to the story its running on empty. And as for characters -- well theres simply nobody on board. Rating note The film contains fairly constant violence and one obscene gesture. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

""Speed Racer"" comes to us from the creators of ""The Matrix"" and as my cerebral cortex was reeling from the onslaught of its jelly-belly colors and ""Lucy in the Sky"" graphics I wondered if there was some parallel universe where it might be considered an entertaining experience. Maybe Japan? This adventurously awful film is awful in many ways at once. It is like a Ferrari poking across East 42nd Street at rush hour fast yet slow. It is futuristically retro. Its attention span is measurable in microseconds yet it runs more than two hours. And it spent a trillion dollars imitating the look of a 10-cent cartoon from the primitive 60s - artistically the Cro-Magnon era. I was initially awed by its splendors. But when Id had my fill there was still an hour-45 left. Not to whine but by the end my eyeballs were on fire. Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch of ""Into the Wild"") comes from a family with a large carbon footprint. His dad Pops (John Goodman) makes fast cars assisted by Mom (Susan Sarandon). His older brother a champion driver himself dies young. Perhaps he couldnt bear living a moment longer knowing that - with the last name Racer and parents who were willing to use Speed as a given name - they saved it for the next kid and stuck him with ""Rex."" Vowing to carry on Rex Racers Earnhardt-esque legacy Speed hits the racetrack in the opening minutes for a zoomy action scene in which he has a chance to break his brothers records. Much like the other big set pieces in the movie the race blasts colors and shapes all over the screen. This could well be the most dazzling thing youve ever seen - or it could make you long for the relative serenity of Saturday night at the disco. Either way its hard to stay interested when the race keeps breaking off into flashbacks. This movies motto is cut to the exposition - or the monkey. Speed Racer has a little brother at home who is prone to getting in ""comical"" situations. I fence the word between quotation marks because the film does. No one is likely to laugh at the squirt as he (for instance) is awed by the sight of a candy display or attacks a ninja by adhering to his calf. Every time we check in on the scampering of the lil tyke and his pet chimp - 20 minutes could have been saved by eliminating them - the racing thrills seem diminished by the jokey context. The Wachowski brothers call their movie motorized kung fu - ""car fu"" - but the monkey makes it more like Jar Jar Fu. This is the costliest piece of camp ever manufactured. Speed is offered a sponsorship by an evil CEO from the Royalton Corp. who uses his stable of talent in a scheme to fix races that affects the price of oil. The CEO spends about 10 minutes explaining this in a scene that has all the narrative pull of the commodities pricing chart in the Financial Times. Instead of joining the dark side Speed joins forces with his girlfriend (Christina Ricci) and former rivals Taejo (played by the Korean pop star Rain) and Racer X a character who has the misfortune to be played by the monotonous Matthew Fox. Hes costumed in one of the shoddiest outfits modeled by a comic-book type since the Riddler pranced around the 1960s ""Batman"" TV show in green polyester pajamas with question marks printed on them. Racer X whose true identity is shrouded looks like a crossing guard at a school for dorks. The racers set off on a cross-country rally against cheating rivals who try to harpoon Speeds tires or send him skittering off an icy cliff. But each time Speed has an answer He pushes a button and the car sprouts shields out of its hubcaps or drops its wounded tires and instantly inflates new ones. Spectacular as this sequence is with awesome digital landscapes ranging from desert to Brandenburg Gate its basically a video game fed by hyperactivity instead of interactivity. The movie makes you crave a streamlined story interesting characters and a joystick. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next WHEN DUDES BECOME DADS Read Next WHEN DUDES BECOME DADS Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46534 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 22438 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 17212 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Action adventures of a teenage racecar driver. With Emile Hirsch Christina Ricci Matthew Fox. Directors the Wachowski brothers (215). PG Cartoonish violence. At area theaters.Remember mixing Pop Rocks candy and Coca-Cola to make little volcanoes inside your head? ""Speed Racer"" is the movie equivalent. In fact there are so many jacked-up visuals over two-plus hours that its target audience of 12-year-old boys may need to summer in an Amish community to calm down.Writer-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski the creators of the ""Matrix"" films once again invent stunning visual tricks in this adaptation of the late-60s Japanese anime. The films eye-popping look is a combo of fast-moving video-game imagery hyperstylized ""wipes"" (images moving from one side of the screen to the other) and super-bright colors. Its the big selling point - one that could make many viewers feel like their eyeballs are on fire. Xbox addicts however will feel right at home. In this Day-Glo world the title hero (Emile Hirsch) is obsessed with racecar driving which isnt a problem when tracks the size of cities appear to be everywhere. Speeds dad Pops (John Goodman) owns an engine company and his older brother Rex (Scott Porter) was a driving legend who reportedly died during a rigged contest. After Speed rejects an offer by a villainous corporate sponsor to become a sellout and drive an assembly-line roadster hes targeted during a round-the-world race but saved more than once by the mysterious Racer X who may or may not be Rex. The global chase plays like an arcade racing game with constantly changing scenery and theres a final Grand Prix blow-out wheel-burner. Trying to follow the convoluted plot though is like reading toy instructions on Christmas morning Skip it and just look at the pretty lights. The cast is generally game for playing cardboard cutouts with Goodman having the most fun. Hirsch (""Into the Wild"") doesnt appear to be awake for the first hour though his laid-back soulfulness adds some dimension. Christina Ricci meanwhile lost some weight and a lot of depth to play his girlfriend Trixie. Also along for the ride is Speeds mischievous little brother (Paulie Litt) and a pet chimp in clothes. Emotionally ""Speed Racer"" stays in the family lane; when cars crash and burn there are little bubbles called ""quick-saves"" that transport drivers to safety. The nostalgia factor is slight and nothing new is added besides the effects. While thats not enough to make it a classic even among chintzy cartoon-born movies middle-schoolers will have a blast. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Photo Warner Bros. Speed Racer 1 / 2 Back to Gallery I was 4 years old when the original Speed Racer first landed on American television arriving at the vanguard of a Japanese anime invasion that continues unabated to this day. My youngest a second-grader has watched it on DVD and is well versed in the world of the snazzy Mach 5 racecar and its loyal driver Speed. This makes both of us qualified to pass judgment on its transformation into a spit-shined 21st-century summer vehicle. He liked it with reservations. I didnt with concessions to its verve. It made him smile. It made me groan. Vive le generation gap. Written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski (who havent worn both hats since 2003s The Matrix Revolutions) Speed Racer is a long large-budgeted aggressively hyper attempt to bring the old show into the era of green-screen filmmaking. For a start they cast sharp actors in several geek-iconic roles Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild) as Speed Racer; Christina Ricci as Speeds plucky girlfriend Trixie; Paulie Litt as his beanie-headed kid brother Spritle; John Goodman as Pops; Susan Sarandon as Mom; and Matthew Fox (Lost) as the misterioso Racer X. The irrelevant plot involves race fixing and Dickensian-style bad guys in porkpie hats. When I asked my son to explain what he liked best about the movie he replied ``The cool stuff - the races. And the kid and the monkey. (Well chimpanzee.) Ill agree that the race scenes are crazy cool a computerized whirlwind of low-slung cars on snaking turns and vertiginous loop-de-loops lit like a Ferris wheel at night. Spritle is indeed a hoot. And the chimp has a cute grin. In deference to the original Hirsch projects bland filial probity while wearing skinny pants and the occasional Eurotrashy neck scarf. Roger Allam hamming it up as a slimeball industrialist E.P. Arnold Royalton shows off a smashing array of purples and golds. The movies palette is garish by design incorporating every color thats ever seen the inside of an Mamp;M bag. The Wachowskis have built their Speed Racer with the look a Saturday-morning cartoon They nest live actors inside computer-generated cars and settings while layers of imagery shift behind and above and around them both foregrounds and backgrounds sharply in focus. The thing is never at rest. Never. It gave me a headache a stomach ache and the less-defined unease that comes from witnessing a major change in the zeitgeist. Because the zeitgeist judging from this movie now embraces rattle-headed visual delirium at all costs. It embraces an approach to cinema that shuns plainspoken clarity and structure for the jittery edits and splintered narrative devices of the video-gaming industry. At films close Speed and Trixie are puckered up and poised to kiss when Spritle jumps in with a very funny fourth-wall alert for ``cootie-sensitive viewers. But those prone to seizures should also take heed because watching Speed Racer provides (Im speculating) the same neural buzz as being trapped for 134 minutes inside a giant spinning lava lamp. And my son? ``Nothing is too much for me he said. But when I asked him what he didnt like about the movie his answer was a litany of too muches too much boring grown-up talk; too much confusion as the story bumps from present to past; too many scenes in which someone gets to monologuing while flashbacks whip past at lighting speed. ``That was annoying he declared. The kids too young for the Matrix trilogy or he might have spotted an old Wachowski weak spot for clangorous graphic overkill - a tendency to throw every available CG gimmick onto the screen just because they can. As Pops says to Royalton ``People like you have way too much money. They start thinkin that the rules everybody else plays by dont mean squat to them.

Emile Hirsch so fine in ""Into the Wild"" plays Speed an ace racer haunted by the death of his elder brother Rex. (What racing family in its right mind tempts fate by naming their son Rex?) As the movie opens Speeds back is to the camera. Hes hunched over in a locker room before a race. His quiet contemplation revs into childhood memories. ""Speed Racer"" inspired by the Japanese manga comic and anime cartoon ""Mach GoGoGo"" then plunges into flashbacks that begin with fun images of a gifted kid obsessed with the family biz. Brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski havent told a story well in ages (some might argue since the original ""Matrix""). They produced but did not direct James McTeigues intriguing riff on terror and resistance ""V for Vendetta"" (2005) based on a British graphic novel. ""Speed Racer"" has ambitions. This tale of Speed his brothers his folks (Susan Sarandon and John Goodman) his girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) is about values the purity of racing and the dangers of corporate greed. The latter arrives in a private jet with a toothy smile. Royalton (Roger Allam) wants Speed to race under the Royalton Industries banner. His front-door approach ingratiates. His back-door strategy involves menacing if bumbling gangsters and strong-arming. That not everyone and everything is for sale is the films guiding lesson. Only its an odd one coming from a movie that demonstrates so very well Hollywoods lax tendencies Pick a property that mixes parental nostalgia for childhood shows and gussies it up big time with newfangled effects to put tiny bottoms in thousands of multiplex seats. Sure the brothers and their go-to effects guru John Gaeta are in hot pursuit of visual ideas. And the animated mix of live-action and computer-generated has high-octane vitality. But the racetrack rivalries lack traction. The rallies and prix become croquet matches in which its more important to knock the opponent into the next yard than win. If the races generated their own excitement the filmmakers wouldnt keep cutting away to a global village of announcers barking their enthusiasm to prove it. Theres a lot of visual noise signifying little. Look no further than Spritle the youngest Racer son for what ails the flick. In a popcorn movie surprisingly thin on light humor Paulie Litts performance comes straight out of ""The Little Rascals"" -- big gestures goofball double-takes all ham bone and sandwich. His chimpanzee Chim- Chim is his quasi-twin. (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals would have you know Chim-Chim is the real deal not digital. Ill have you know theres scant charm in his presence or use.) In early flashbacks Scott Porter (Jason Street in ""Friday Night Lights"") brings enough big-brother mystery to Rex that you believe the gap left when he leaves a disgraced racer then dies in a cross country rally Speed will repeat. From the duo who brought you the ""Matrix"" koan ""There is no spoon"" come a few bite-size kernels of aha wisdom. ""Stop steering start driving"" Rex tells Speed. Later the masked Racer X offers similarly sage advice about the difference between being a driver and being driven. So familiar are his words that Speed suspects he might be his lost brother. If youre a gas-tank-half-empty sort then ""Speed Racer"" is an overstimulating disappointment. If youre a gas tank half full sort then youll thank Sarandon and Goodman for their portrayals of Mom and Pops Racer. In the midst of the din their grief their pride their support of Speed provide real fuel for thought.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor May 9 2008 Save for later Saved Dont see the new Wachowski Brothers movie ""Speed Racer"" if your memories of that 60s Japanese cartoon show are less than fond. Also dont see it if youd rather play a video game than be trapped inside one. And dont go expecting a ""Matrix""-style experience.Maybe that last warning is not quite accurate. The Wachowskis of course were the masterminds behind the ""Matrix"" trilogy and try as they might to reverse course and make a candy-colored family-entertainment lalapalooza theyre still courting nightmarishness. ""Speed Racer"" is so garishly straightlaced that its positively surreal.I was not one of those boomers who spent my dewy years parked in front of the TV screen shouting ""Go Speed Racer go"" I would like to think that this defect in my upbringing does not disqualify me from passing judgment on a movie that certainly does not need my help on its run to riches. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But the last time I checked a family entertainment movie was supposed to entertain the entire family. For the sake of their kids most parents have learned to endure the pap that passes for family fare these days but the 135-minute ""Speed Racer"" may have set the bar on what parents can endure. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Speed Racer out of gas The irony is that ""Speed Racer"" prides itself on being a movie about bedrock family values. The family that races together stays together - sort of. And the Racer family lives and dies for racing. Pops (John Goodman) is a race-car designer and his two eldest sons Rex (Scott Porter) and Speed (Emile Hirsch) are demons on the track. Another son the pipsqueak Spritle (Paulie Litt who looks like Goodmans Mini-Me) cheers them on. Even their obstreperous pet chimp Chim-Chim gets in on the act. (Can a chimp be a ham?) Mom (Susan Sarandon) is the calming influence holding everything together.When a big bad racing tycoon (Roger Allam resembling a cross between Christopher Hitchens and Al Gore) tries to snare Speeds talents and is rebuffed the Day-Glo movie suddenly gets all moralistic. Speed goes it alone the little guy who refuses to knuckle under to corporate interests.This is a rather odd message coming from a big-studio Hollywood movie designed to kick off a 1 billion franchise. Whats even odder is that the Wachowskis think their bug-eyed Grand Prix hoo-ha functions as a fable about the importance of family. For that to be the case youd have to accept the Racers as something more than a gaggle of human-scaled cartoon characters. The Wachowskis are reaching for ""heart"" in this movie - a quality that was noticeably AWOL in the ""Matrix"" movies - but their own hearts arent in it. Theyre too wound up by the new Sony F-23 HD cameras and the (sometimes cheesy) CGI effects.""Speed Racer"" is so hyperfrenetic that in the end you wonder if the Wachowskis arent trying to pull off an elaborate hoax - a deranged techno fantasia posing as retro-ish family fare. Grade C- (Rated PG for sequences of action some violence and language.)

Comments Speed Racer The Matrix creators Andy and Larry Wachowski barrel through this adaptation of the 60s animated series hoping perhaps that no one will notice the story is as flat as roadkill. Using hypersaturated primary colors and panoramic CGI backdrops theyve constructed a live-action adventure that plays like a cartoon equal parts retro kitsch and futuristic fantasy. Emile Hirsch stars as the title race-car driver who mourns his dead brother while fighting corruption on the pro racing circuit. Second unit director James McTeigue and visual effects wizards John Gaeta and Dan Glass created the blazing track sequences. With Christina Ricci John Goodman Susan Sarandon and Matthew Fox as the mysterious Racer X. PG 136 min.

(MAGGIE FERRREIRA/PARAMOUNT VANTAGE VIA AP) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / May 9 2008 Watching ""Speed Racer"" the new summer lollapalooza from the Wachowski brothers is like being force-fed a Costco-size bag of your favorite candy. For half an hour taste buds you didnt know you had are firing in delirium stoked by the movies outrageous visual razzle-dazzle. Then you hit that spot in the bag where you know you should stop but the movie keeps going. You feel more and more bloated; the movie keeps going. At a certain point you may wonder if the movies eating you. It doesnt end so much as vomit the audience out.Thats entertainment I suppose or an experience or a night out at the movies on acid. In ""Speed Racer"" millions of dollars and billions of computer cycles have been expended creating a digital wonder-world simulacrum - an unimaginably amped-up CGI-enhanced live action version of the beloved 1960s Japanese anime many of us remember from US airings on upper-dial broadcast and cable stations (Channel 56 in Boston for me a half-eaten Space Stick in my hand).The show created by Tatsuo Yoshida was in the mold of Osamu Tezukas groundbreaking ""Astro Boy"" flat fast catchy hilariously dubbed in all italics. Boy car-fanatic Speed Racer drove his Mach 5 against colorful opponents with hidden tire-knives while girlfriend Trixie parents Pops and Mom little brother Spritle and their pet chimp Chim-Chim screeched and swooned in the stands. Wonderful at 4 in the afternoon when you should be doing homework but is there a movie in it?The Wachowskis - still trying to match ""The Matrix"" - respond by building a universe out of pixels and aiming for a massive sugar high. The skies are a cobalt digital blue here the clouds on loan from Teletubbyland. The racetracks blissfully defy all engineering logic and the cars flip and careen with 800-horsepower abandon (producer Joel Silver has dubbed the action sequences ""Car Fu""). The time period is the 1960s seen through the nostalgic GAF View-Master of a 21st century graphic designer - its future retro. The sensibility is Hot Wheels on industrial steroids. My inner 7-year-old was having atrial fibrillations.There are people here sort of. ""Speed Racer"" drops human actors into its breathless visual schema like drops of water on a hot griddle Emile Hirsch as Speed Christina Ricci as Trixie Susan Sarandon and John Goodman as Mom and Pops. Hirsch is appropriately wooden - any trace of his ""Into the Wild"" passion has been sandblasted off - and Ricci appears to have lost more than 50 percent of her body weight; shes all chin and mischievous saucer-eyes. The movies the wayward grandchild of ""Tron"" the 1982 Disney film that doodled primitive computer graphics over actors like Jeff Bridges.The intentionally banal plot barely merits a mention but here goes Speed resists the enticements of a swishy omnipotent tycoon (Roger Allam channeling late-period Tim Curry) and schemes to expose him with the help of the not-so-mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox of ""Lost"" looking dandy in his bondage mask) Japanese racer Taejo (Rain) and the dauntless Inspector Detector (Benno Furmann). Its a corporate power fantasy about the evils of corporate power basically; an irony the filmmakers flatten in their race to the finish.""Speed Racer"" screeches to a halt every so often for boilerplate inspirational speeches - reprised toward the end in a goofy greatest-hits montage - and for cutesy slapstick involving Spritle (Paulie Litt) and the chimpanzees playing Chim-Chim (less amusing if you credit rumors of animal abuse on the German shooting locations).Mostly the Wachowskis rev the movies motor in geometrically increasing RPMs building inexorably to a climax that can only be described as NASCAR Zen orgasm. Aiming to replicate the experience of the anime on a metastasized scale ""Speed Racer"" unsnaps the characters from the frame and lets them deliver their lines on floating multiple planes of action constantly wiping this way and that like cars playing chicken on a crowded freeway. Its enthralling and then its exhausting and it never lets up.On the levels of technical craftsmanship and pure eye-candy ""Speed Racer"" is some kind of triumph of the will. It has a knowing foot in pop art as well - the movie could be a Roy Lichtenstein canvas using pixels instead of zipatone dots. Its also thunderingly proudly empty in a way that prompts either total submission or thoughts of resistance. The movie demands you be a glutton for sensation and then has the nerve to ask why youre not hungrier.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

But like a kid whos had totally too much candy (and theres one in Speed Racer) inevitably a crash is involved. Not just a wheel-spinning pileup on the track but the kind of physical and mental collapse that comes from two-hours-plus exposure to kaleidoscopic digital imagery zooming motorway mayhem and dialogue thats all snap crackle and cool. Based on the 1960s Japanese animated TV series and brought to the screen in a primary-colors splash of live-action CG and green-screen effects by Andy and Larry Wachowski - in their first directing job since 2003s Matrix sequels - Speed Racer makes absolutely no effort to root itself in the real world. Instead the universe of Speed Racer offers futuro cityscapes and neon-limned architecture and race arenas that look like Las Vegas gone wild. Meanwhile the suburban homestead of the Racer clan - Speed (Emile Hirsch) little brother Spritle (Paulie Litt) Mom (Susan Sarandon) and Dad (John Goodman) - is a populuxe pastiche of midcentury modern and 21st-century tech with a paint chart thatll blow your head off. I cant imagine what this thing does to your retinas in Imax - and Speed Racer opens on close to 100 such mega-format screens (including UA King of Prussia locally). Hirsch - last seen in the 180-degrees different Into the Wild - plays the talented young driver haunted by the memory of his older brother Rex a racing champ who went down in a blaze of crumpled metal and scandal. With the support of his parents (a father who designs race cars a mother who makes PBamp;Js) the eager encouragement of his pipsqueak sibling and a pet chimp and an assist or two from a trusty Aussie mechanic (Kick Gurry) Speed takes to the track shunning a lucrative sponsorship deal from the yellow-toothed tycoon E.P. Arnold Royalton (Roger Allam). While Royalton plots and schemes to defeat and humiliate Speed Speeds girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) provides counsel - and go-get-em grins and modelistic poses. And then theres Racer X (Matthew Fox) a masked figure who gives guru sound bites. For example ""You dont climb into a T-180 to be a driver. You do it because youre driven."" In a nod to its origins Speed Racer features a punky Japanese rival driver played by the Asian pop star Rain his dishy girlfriend Horuko (Yu Nan) an Asian industrialist (Hiroyuki Sanada) and a nifty ninja kickfest - one of the few action set pieces that dont involve careening down the track or defying the G-forces in a cross-country car rally. The brothers Wachowski are at their inventive best spinning narrative details with stop-and-start montages - theres an explanation of the identity of Racer X near movies end that works with the economy and visual dazzle of a classic silent-screen sequence. And theres really no ""acting"" to speak of in Speed Racer - its more like mugging for the camera a steering wheel prop in hand with the knowledge that several thousand digital renderers will fill in the blanks. But Hirsch manages to convey some angst (""Im caught in a tailspin - Im so confused right now"") as he turns his head in profile his modified Elvis pompadour about to be encased by the crash helmet with the big M on it. Thats for Mifune Motors by the way from the original Japanese toon. Speed Racer  (out of four stars) Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski. With Emile Hirsch Christina Ricci Susan Sarandon John Goodman Matthew Fox Paulie Litt and Roger Allam. Distributed by Warner Bros. Films. Running time 2 hours 9 mins.

The visuals for Speed Racer are like nothing youve seen before. The ever-inventive Wachowski brothers of Matrix fame come about as close as you can to placing the audience inside a video game - a fast-motion Day-Glo gravity-doesnt-apply video game. The question is whether thats where the audience wants to be. Theres trouble if it isnt. Beyond the look of the film Speed Racer doesnt have much else to offer particularly if you no longer shop in the childrens department. Kids will love it but they wont necessarily be curious about it beyond the obvious question that adults also will ponder Whats it all about again? Well its about Speed (Emile Hirsch) the middle son of a racing family. Its a mom-and-pop outfit - Pops Racer (John Goodman) builds the cars while Mom (Susan Sarandon) offers support sandwiches and the occasional welding and soldering if needed. But the Racers have been touched by tragedy Years before eldest son Rex (Scott Porter) was killed in a fiery accident during a race. We know this through a series of jumps back and forth in time as Speed in the middle of a race allows his mind to wander to his childhood. In addition to the crash and its aftermath on his family he recalls meeting girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) for the first time. Evidently racing cars at unfathomable speeds leaves drivers ample time for self-reflection. The time shifts are hard to follow but thats OK because the rest of the plot is even more difficult to grasp. It centers on Royalton (Roger Allam) the owner and namesake of huge Royalton Industries. He wants Speed as a driver on his team. But Speed is torn. Signing with Royalton will cost his family the independent status it so clearly treasures. But it also will result in untold wealth really cool perks and what appears to be a really nice suit. Of course theres more. Royalton is all oily weasely charm so you know hes up to something. Turns out racing is rigged for reasons that have to do with . . . the stock market basically. Theres nothing kids love more than an exciting yarn about insider trading. Fighting the corruption which may have cost Rex his life is Racer X (Matthew Fox) a masked man who works with Inspector Detector (Benno Furmann) to clean up the sport. (Racer X does this it seems by causing lots of wrecks. Hey whatever works.) In the end the good-vs.-evil battle is fought on the track. Twice. Speed is a natural we know thanks to a Star Wars-like flashback with little Speed (Nicholas Elia) on Rexs lap steering a race car. Rex tells him to listen to the car that its a living breathing thing. Its probably the kind of thing that makes more sense in a movie in which the cars obey the laws of physics but there you have it. The cast kind of an afterthought in a film like this is uniformly OK although when Fox breaks out his tough-guy voice its more funny than menacing. The best of the lot is Paulie Litt a Goodman Mini-Me who plays Spritle the youngest of the Racers. He and his constant companion Chim-Chim the chimpanzee are always on hand to foil the bad guys. Maybe its because hes so young but Litt is the most comfortable with the material bringing a genuine enthusiasm to living out his Saturday-morning-cartoon fantasies. Fitting because Speed Racer is based on a Japanese comic and TV show long a cult favorite. The film version takes the basics and cranks them up a few notches visually. Ultimately Speed Racer comes down to the lesson your parents taught you Despite the flash looks arent everything. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Speed Racer | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; speed-racer ) Speed Racer (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres no doubt that the Wachowskis vision of Speed Racer is big wild and overripe with garish colors. Its what Id imagine it might be like trapped inside a video game or a pinball machine. Its a kaleidoscope gone mad. Yet this kind of visual overdrive has its limits and with little else to recommend it Speed Racer passes the barrier between 21st century innovation and psychedelic diarrhea long before the cars have come close to the finish line. What impresses with its ""wow"" factor early on becomes repetitive and headache-inducing later in the proceedings. At an exceedingly long 135 minutes the film needs more than what might result from the explosion of a Crayola factory and Speed Racer has nothing extra to offer - no heart no excitement no moments to cherish. Speed Racer is based on cartoon that is revered in some circles as an early pre-cursor to anime. In crafting their ""live"" version the Wachowskis have tried to remain faithful to the source material while attempting a radical upgrade. The difference between ""classic"" Speed Racer and this is like comparing a horse-drawn carriage to a Lamborghini. Everything except the actors in this movie were manipulated on a computer. The sense of artifice is monumental and intentional as are many of the cheesy graphics. When the cars look like hot wheels vehicles zooming around the track one has to assume that was the idea. The laws of physics and logic have been stripped from the equation. This is spectacle at 24 frames per second colors images cars zipping and flying in all directions - everything for the ADD viewer except Im wondering what ADD viewer is going to sit through more than two hours of this. Theres a reason why Disney limits the running time of its animated pictures but thats not a lesson the Wachowskis have learned. Occasionally the movie dials things down and tries to remind us there are human beings in the movie by giving them painfully false ""character moments."" This may be the most insulting aspect of the movie - expecting us to accept these paper-thin individuals as anything more than animated props. Worse still the dialogue during these supposedly ""moving"" scenes is full of clunkers and clichA(c)s. Its bad soap opera. Not only are there a few too many of these scenes but almost all of them last too long. The only interesting thing about most of them is the inventive means by which the Wachowskis transition into and out of them. No wipes or irises for these brothers. The story - or at least what passes for one - introduces us to the Racer family. (This hearkens back to the days when a surname represented an individuals craft Carpenter Smith Baker Miller etc.) Theres Pops Racer (John Goodman) Mom Racer (Susan Sarandon) Rex Racer (Scott Porter) Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) and Spritle Racer (Paulie Litt). Trixie (Christina Ricci) Speeds girlfriend is around so much shes like a daughter to Pops and Mom. Rex doesnt have a lot of screen time - hes burnt to a crisp during an early flashback. Most of the movie concerns Speed coming into his own on the track. When he wins a high-profile race he catches the eye of big business mogul Royalton (Roger Allam) who wants Speed to race for him. But theres a conflict of interests here Speed races for the love of the sport but Royalton does it for the money and claims that all of the big races are fixed. Thus begins Speeds quest to prove himself and upset the plans of the fixers. He has a few allies - Trixie his family and the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) a character who looks like a bad superhero knock-off. Arguably the most disappointing aspect of Speed Racer is the lack of excitement in the races. Since these contests were executed entirely on a computer one would expect them to have been developed with fluidity and clarity. Instead theyre a jumpy jittery and at times incoherent blur. The Watchowskis make it a chore to figure out whos in the lead and during some of the more extreme moves whats going on. To speed things along they turn portions of the races into montages. The ""sport"" element is completely removed from the storyline. Victory is a fait accompli. The only thing were sticking around in the theater for is to see how outrageous the track can get. Theres more energy and tension in George Lucas much-maligned pod race in The Phantom Menace than in all of Speed Racers numerous contests combined. Its amazing how competent actors can fade into the background when overwhelmed by such flamboyant visuals. Emile Hirsch who showed acting chops in Sean Penns Into the Wild is almost invisible here. John Goodman and Susan Sarandon only have a few instances in which they stand out more forcefully than the wallpaper. Matthew Fox is lost. Only Christina Ricci and Roger Allam call attention to themselves. Ricci does it because she somehow conveys a sense that she belongs in this world. Allam does it by going so far over the top that the air starts getting thin. His Royalton is the kind of Big Bad Tycoon who makes Rupert Murdoch seem like a philanthropist and Donald Trump resemble a poster boy for humility. Throughout their careers which have had big ups and downs the Wachowskis have never been known for restraint and theres none of it evident here. Speed Racer is the perfect companion piece for a kick-ass video game. It looks and feels like one - so much so that older viewers may find themselves flashing back to Tron. The filmmakers would like us to believe that Speed Racer has been designed with the ""kid in all of us"" in mind and thats as clear an admission of its juvenile nature as anything. Still one has to wonder whether the target audience might not be children but LSD users in search of a flashback. Because in the end its a bad trip.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr ((c) Warner Bros.) D Speed Racer Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Emile Hirsch Christina Ricci Matthew Fox Susan Sarandon; Director Andy Wachowski Lana Wachowski; Author Andy Wachowski Lana Wachowski; Release Date Wide 05/09/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 135; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted May 16 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT Young boys are the only suitable audience for Speed Racer the elaborate live-action adaptation written and directed by Matrix creators Larry and Andy Wachowski. And even they might feel an urge to squirm between the videogame-style whizbang jellybean-colored CG-jiggered car races that are the adrenalized heart of this entertainment with no soul. For almost everyone else the movie will be a bit of a drag. And in this context ""everyone else"" is a population including but not limited to grown men who love Japanese manga baby boomers who remember watching the rudimen!tary junky cartoons as kids when there was nothing better on grown women willing to sit through the noise with their own kids because at least the story promotes family loyalty and cooperation and kid sisters dragged along with their brothers with an assurance that the epony!mous hero chastely dates a girl whos an ace behind the wheel herself. As a refresher for the majority who wont re!member the forgettable cartoons Speed (Emile Hirsch) is the second son of the car-crazy Racer family. Hes got a gruff automobile-building Pops (John Goodman) with a mustache like a broom; a perky Mom (Susan Sarandon) who looks dewy even when shes lending a hand with a wrench; a wiseacre kid brother Spritle (Paulie Litt) who maintains a retro J. Fred Muggs-era relationship with his pet chimp; a sassy girl!friend Trixie (Christina Ricci) who can drive fast and bat her eyelashes at the same time; and a mentor in the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) who sometimes competes with Speed on the track but is always there to encourage him to do the right thing. What really drives Speed though is his desire to live up to the memory of his legendary older brother a champ who died racing. Speed tries to break records to the ac!companiment of the Wachowskis manic expen!sive displays of whooshy technical showman!ship but the car guys drive to succeed doesnt feel urgent merely a necessity to make the gears of the movie turn. Clearly the thrill of translat!ing the sensation of velocity into a pop visual vocabulary is what really turns the brothers on. For greed-in-our-time relevance theyve brought in an evil business-world fat cat (Roger Allam) with teeth like a busted grill who offers to sponsor Speeds quest for greatness provided he throws races to suit the tycoons corporate schemes. But the Wachowskis hearts arent in the human stuff. The story with its stilted refer!ences to ""power and the unassailable might of money"" is as stiff as the old cartoons. Speed was born to shift gears. A charming flashback to his grade-school days establishes the younger Speed as a mediocre student and a fidgety candidate for ADD therapy at peace only when making vroom-vroom noises and drawing flip-page animations of moving vehicles. (I knew these boys in school how about you?) But now hes got to spend his days listening to Racer Xs cereal-box Zen teachings ""Stop steering and start driving. The car is alive. Close your eyes and listen. You do it because youre driven. Racing is what you do."" Regular drivers-ed courses do not generally advise the lowered-eyelid approach to road safety but Speed isnt about to be tested on parallel-parking skills. When the Speed Racer TV theme song was adapted from the Japanese rendition the lyrics turned into dunderheaded stuff like ""Hes a demon on wheels/Hes a demon and hes gonna be chasin after someone."" This newest iteration is about a demon on wheels whos chasin after someone for 135 minutes -- which makes for an awful lot of wheel spinning. But the young man is not so much a demon as a cipher arbitrarily assigned a succession of heros challenges among them making the right moral choices establishing an adult relationship with Pops and letting Trixie move their relationship forward at least as far as a decent kiss. Without a ravaged stare to focus his performance as it did in Into the Wild Hirsch recedes even as his character hurtles forward. Hes a blank of a hero outdramatized in every scene by an imposing Goodman a Sarandon who harks back to her Rocky Horror beginnings a goggling Ricci and a luxuriously rotten-styled Allam. In a display of relativity Einstein might have admired Speed Racer appears to slow down even as the hero himself achieves record-breaking velocity. Forget what happens on the racetrack. This is one vehicle that stalls.

By Anthony Lane A car-racing familys name is at stake in the Wachowski brothers new movie.   Credit ISTVAN BANYAI Gluttons for ""Duck Soup"" will remember the scene in which Groucho is faced with an official document. ""Why a four-year-old child could understand this report"" he says. ""Run out and find me a four-year-old child."" My sentiments exactly as I sat in a cathedral-size auditorium wreathed in the ineffable mysteries of ""Speed Racer."" This is the latest offering from Andy and Larry Wachowski bringers of ""The Matrix"" and if it is about anything it is about the quest to overwhelm a particular stratum of the masses. A four-year-old will be reduced to a gibbering but highly gratified wreck; an eight-year-old will wander around wearing a look that was last seen on the face of Dante after he met Beatrice. But what about the rest of us? True our eyeballs will slowly though never completely recover but what of our souls? I reckon the M.P.A.A. should use the advent of ""Speed Racer"" to revive an old ratings symbol a big Roman X meaning ""of no conceivable interest to anyone over the age of ten."" The plot coiling backward and forward in time is like the knotted laces of a broken boot barely worth unpicking. To get some idea of the Wachowskis finesse all you need to know is that ""Speed Racer"" tells the story of a race-car driver known to be very speedy by the name of Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch). Does that not suggest a preemptive strike by his parents Mom Racer (Susan Sarandon) and Pops Racer (John Goodman) as they dandled him at the baptismal font? What if the poor child had grown up wanting to raise delphiniums? Speed has a younger brother called Spritle (Paulie Litt) and he once had an adored older brother Rex (Scott Porter) who was killed at the wheel. Apparently Rex had dragged the sport of racing into disrepute; now its up to Speed to restore the Racer name. Along the way he must make nice to Trixie who is said to be his girlfriend but hangs out with the family as if she were his sister. Trixie is played by Christina Ricci an odd coincidence since Trixie is just the kind of marshmallow-brained creature that the Ricci of old--the funky Ricci who played Wednesday Addams--would have roasted over a naked flame. The film revolves around cars yet there are practically no cars. Almost all the vehicles you see are digital creations as is the track itself and they cannon and collide with the harmless mayhem that anyone versed in Hot Wheels will recall with pride. The entire movie indeed is what Tom Wolfe would call a Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby complete with achingly blue skies customized deserts fantastical mountains and everything from Goodmans shirt to Riccis fingernails daubed in lollipop hues; it makes the world of Pee-wee Herman look like Anselm Kiefer. So how did this rainbow of velocity end up bleached of fun? The answer lies with those darn Wachowskis and with the theory mooted in the first ""Matrix"" film and clung to ever since that all of us whether we know it or not are squirming under the thumb of dark controlling forces. Hence the sneering hulk of Royalton (Roger Allam) who tries to recruit Speed to his racing team a subsidiary of the giant Royalton Industries and who when spurned vows to crush him with ""the unassailable might of money."" Oh please. There have always been filmmakers who lauded the home-baked virtues of the family enterprise but none perhaps have done so with such a gaping want of irony. Faux-leftish paranoia about big business should be slightly harder to peddle when a chunk of your paycheck comes from Time Warner whose revenues make it the largest media conglomerate on the planet but the Wachowskis are unabashed; they want everything both ways stuffing the cast with multinational actors (""Speed Racer"" is based on a Japanese comic book and TV show from the nineteen-sixties) yet still supplying the hero with a pancake-flipping mother a father who builds a winning car in his own garage and a glass of cold milk on the victors podium. Though the film is not as criminally poor as ""V for Vendetta"" which the Wachowskis wrote in 2005 it struck me as more insidious. Theres something about the ululating crowds who line the action in color-coordinated rows; the desperate skirting of ordinary feelings in favor of the trumped-up variety; the confidence in technology as a spectacle in itself; and above all the sense of master manipulators posing as champions of the little people. What does that remind you of ? You could call it entertainment and use it to wow your children for a couple of hours. To me it felt like Pop fascism and I would keep them well away. The first few minutes of ""Turn the River"" feel like pieces of a story that has cracked and fallen apart. We see a kid stopping off at a pool hall on his way to school. We see a tired woman with a toothpick between her lips playing cards--badly at first then well enough to win. Gradually the fragments come together the woman kneels down arms wide in Central Park and the boy runs into her embrace. They are we now realize mother and son but life has spun them away from each other into opposing worlds. Kailey (Famke Janssen) is a pool hustler with a criminal record and no fixed abode whereas Gulley ( Jaymie Dornan) who was taken from her as a baby lives with his father David (Matt Ross) and attends a private Catholic school uptown. Kailey has no claim on her boy not even visitation rights unless you count the claim of undying love; the two of them stay in touch through letters with Quinn (Rip Torn) the owner of the pool hall acting as a go-between. What is impressive about these early scenes is the faith and courtesy that they extend to the audience. They dont present the information in slabs but release it drop by drop and expect us to work out the truth for ourselves. In short ""Turn the River"" plays it cool--not bad when you realize that Chris Eigeman normally an actor is making his debut here as a writer and director and when you weigh the mass of sadness that sits upon his film. The pool hall of course is a classic arena of delusion and disappointment and the events in ""Turn the River"" would not have raised an eyebrow among Paul Newman George C. Scott and the other residents of ""The Hustler"" Robert Rossens majestically downbeat pool picture of 1961. Eigemans movie with its flat fuggy color and details muffled in grain is not a fraction as beautiful as its predecessor whose black-and-white images still bite into the memory like a case of knives. Yet the new movie has one edge on the old in that it drags a lonely female figure from the sidelines and brings her to the table. Piper Laurie was a rending presence in ""The Hustler"" but the Famke Janssen character is something worse. She is God help her one of the boys. There are few living actresses as gorgeous as Janssen--think of her statuesque mutant in the ""X-Men"" saga--but few could have done a better job of looking like death. If she comes across as unlovely here the reason is simple Kailey is stuck in a force field of self-loathing. Even the basics seem to elude her. She sleeps on a pool table stretched out on the baize as if on a marble tomb and eats in her truck in a darkened parking lot picking bits out of her food and dropping them out the window. Nobody hits on her and you can see why although one guy does hit her as if she were a man after she takes a couple of hundred bucks off him in a game. At moments like that the whole of New York--home school and recreational space--seems to bridle with insecurity and fear. Look at Gulley and David facing each other across chasms of mistrust. The son lies to his father about the letters he writes to Kailey saying that hes keeping a diary. The response is like a punch ""What are you a nine-year-old girl?"" No wonder Kailey wants to spirit Gulley out of town. It means raising fifty thousand dollars at pool and that means playing for ten thousand a rack. And that means finding someone rich enough and weak enough to be hustled into a trap--someone like Duncan ( John Juback) who looks like Tony Randall gone to seed. I can tell you the exact moment at which ""Turn the River"" takes the wrong bend. It comes when our heroine not content with buying fake passports so that she and Gulley can flee to Canada asks her supplier for a gun. She doesnt need one and from here on the movie hurries her into decisions that seem out of character. Eigeman loses some of his calm nudging the film halfway toward a thriller but Kailey like a visitor from a Raymond Carver story is past the age of thrills. Skip the coda to this movie with its tiny upswing of hope and remember the days at the tables as dim and endless as nights and the click of the dialogue. It sounds tight enough but beneath it lies the listless knowledge that life is just one damn rack after another ""Were playing nine-ball."" ""What happened to one-pocket?"" ""It went away.""

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review No Speed Racer No The Wachowski brothers arent playing with a full set of crayons. By David Edelstein Published May 4 2008 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) For those of us who gripe that modern sci-fi and fantasy films consist of actors emoting gamely opposite Players to be Animated Later the prospect of the Wachowski brothers Speed Racer was paradoxically tantalizing This time no one would be trying to pass off a cyber-universe as anything but virtual. From the previews it was clear that the people were props in an ecstatically cartoony world with its own laws of time space and motion. Instead of actors superimposed over futuristic Deco backdrops as in the handsome but congealed Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow Speed Racer would be organically fake an unbridled orgy of artifice. Orgy hell The film is like a nightmare in which youre trapped in an arcade with screens on all sides and no eyelids. Based on an elemental but happily streamlined Japanese cartoon (an anime precursor) its an eyesore a shambles with incoherent action and ear-buckling dialogue. The colors flatten everything The cars and costumes look like theyve been filled in with crayonsand not from the big 64-box but the dinky eight-pack. The plot is relatively intricate which means the Wachowskis leap back and forth between hyperspeedy races and static scenes in which marooned actors labor to find a style as campy as the decor. BACKSTORY When anime demigod Tatsuo Yoshida created the manga original of Speed Racer in the sixties he called it Mach GoGoGo and took inspiration from two American films Elvis Presleys Viva Las Vegas and Sean Connerys Goldfinger. The English-dubbed version debuted in 1967 and the Speed Racer franchise has proved ever resilient with reruns on MTV and the Cartoon Network. Its also a natural bonanza for merchandising. The marketing of the Wachowski brothers feature may top 80 million with tie-ins from General Mills McDonalds Mattel Legolike Speed Racer Fruit Gushers and his-and-her Happy Meals. Speed Racer a merchandisers dream is all about the perils of spurning a vast merchandising corporation (not unlike Time Warner in whose skyscraper I watched the film). Speed (Emile Hirsch) resists the blandishments of Royalton Industries (represented by Roger Allam in a pus-yellow jacket lavender tie and pink cravat) and stubbornly sticks with his mom-and-pop organization Mom (Susan Sarandon) and Pops (John Goodman) along with his pudgy kid brother Spritle (Paulie Litt) and a fervent chimpanzee. Chaste girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) buttresses Speeds integrityas does the ramrod Inspector Detector (Benno Furmann) and the masked anti-corporate vigilante known as Racer X (Matthew Fox). Dirty trickster capitalist toolswho likely destroyed the reputation of Speeds late brother Rex Racerconstantly nip at his wheels. Speed Racer has moments of bliss which are not coincidentally its simplest. Little Spritle envisions himself and his monkey as martial-arts superheroes in a bit that conjures up the carefree color-splashes of kindergartners. Young Speed spies the adoring Trixie on the playground and flowers behind her head morph deliriously into hearts. This is truly a new worldone where filmmakers can layer images the way music producers layer voices and instruments. In The Matrix the Wachowskis and their computer-effects whiz John Gaeta gave us the gold standard of universe-as-simulacrum movies. But here as in the lumbering Matrix sequels the giddiness is gone Free your mind has been replaced with Overwork your programmers. Theyve become fussy and solemnLucasoids. Whats fascinating about Speed Racer is that the Wachowskis and Gaeta dont seem to know the first thing about storyboarding a race. You can forgive a cheap live-action movie for moments of disorientationthe filmmakers are limited by their coverage by what they actually shot. But how to explain an entirely computerized race in which you cant tell where anyone is in relation to anyone else? In the high-speed wrecks no one diesthe drivers are instantly encased in foamy balls and swirl down a drain in the track. Why isnt this the coolest thing imaginable? Because the crashes are so hard to follow that you barely register what happened. The filmmakers have put all their creative energy into transitions. A radio conversation among drivers is a series of close-ups without cuts The camera whooshes from the car in back to the car in front to the car in back without a second in between. Amazing Flashbacks unfold on the screen while the camera is revolving in a 360-degree arcthey finish at the instant we get back to the speaker. Neat But what does it say when transitions are more thrilling than the scenes on either side of them? Christina Ricci has little to do but look peppy but she has the perfect heart-shaped face for live-action animeall pop-out eyes. (Her orbs make Susan Sarandons googlers seem ordinary.) Emile Hirsch doesnt come through and not because he acts badly; its because his face doesnt read the way Riccis does. Almost nothing reads. In an early scene Rex instructs Speed to close his eyes and listen to his carits not a machine he says its a living breathing thing. This is the philosophical core of Speed Racer the idea that all the molecules of the universe are in motion that everything is alive. But its hard to peddle Zen Oneness if your state-of-the-art technological marvel is dead as a dodo. At last years Virginia Film Festival I met the director Nick Broomfield there to show his freshly minted atrocity-of-war drama Battle for Haditha and we talked a bit about the controversy over Brian De Palmas uncompromisingly brutal Redactedwhich also builds to the murder of Iraqi civilians by U.S. military personnel. The conversation was off the record and Broomfield was extremely circumspect. But its fair to say he saw a distinction between his own approach and that of De Palma who rubbed our noses in the sadism of the killers. Now that Ive seen the film its clear that Broomfields take is closer to HBOs The Wire in that events are depicted from several different angles and no perspective is complete The point is not to focus on individuals but on the ways in which their actions feed the larger (diseased) organism. 1 2 Next Share this story...

True to its origins as a 60s Japanese animated kiddie favorite ""Speed Racer"" blasts into cultural prominence four decades later as an ultra-cartoony actioner defined by its Day-Glo colors resistance to any laws of physics and notions of good and evil that go no further than having the hero drive a white car. Aimed squarely at family audiences the Wachowski Brothers return behind the camera for the first time since ""The Matrix"" trilogy is a blur of video action painting and very loud sounds notable solely for its technical wizardry. Otherwise its pure cotton candy -- entirely non-nutritious but too sweet and pretty for young people to resist. General audiences worldwide look to make this Warner Bros. release a substantial hit in all formats from Imax to eventual homeview sales with extra coin assured from moppets who require repeat viewings. In its thinly developed narrative dully functional dialogue paramount devotion to family cohesion and somewhat cheesy albeit expensive CGI-against-greenscreen look ""Speed Racer"" reminds one of nothing so much as Robert Rodriguezs ""Spy Kids"" movies. Like them the new pic is tolerable fun for the easy to please but completely silly if held up to any scrutiny. It also remains mystifying why producers currently believe its a good idea for moppet-aimed movies to run well over two hours. Which is not to say the target audience wont be amused or at least distracted through most of ""Speed Racer."" With the visual aesthetic of Japanese anime shot through with vidgame dynamics this glossy outsized bauble with a perky cast will make kids feel right at home. For others however it will be a cinematic pile-up. The Wachowskis script includes a procession of mild twists withheld identities and mysterious motivations but its throughline unwaveringly stresses the goodness and purity of the independent maverick over the venality of profit-obsessed corporations. Former qualities are embodied by every member of the quaintly named Racer family rock-solid car designer Pops (John Goodman) steadfast Mom (Susan Sarandon) and racing-mad sons Rex (Scott Porter) Speed (Emile Hirsch) and Spritle (pint-sized Goodman lookalike Paulie Litt). Time-jumping opening reveals how the handsome dashing Rex seemingly died in an epic crash years back an event that haunts Speed whose skill is now such that hes courted by unctuous tycoon Royalton (Roger Allam) to join his team of top drivers. When rejected however Royalton turns nasty and suggests Speed is just as washed up as his late brother. The action pulls over for occasional pit stops involving Racer family mix-ups; some literal monkeyshines (Spritles constant companion in mischief is a mug-happy chimp); and secondary characters that include an Asian racing team (among them a driver played by Korean pop sensation Rain who will boost B.O. in that part of the world) a sports corruption investigator a band of very broadly played thugs who ineptly try to put the brakes on Speed and a mysterious masked man named Racer X (Matthew Fox) who may or may not be Rex resurrectus. But for the most part ""Speed Racer"" is on the move which keeps the eyes busy but also presents plausibility problems for anyone impertinent enough to pose them. The racing venues both man-made and in a cross-country rally resemble a fearsome combination of roller coaster slalom course and skateboard facility; theyre contorted with impossible twists and turns quadruple black-diamond grades open-air gaps and deliberate obstacles. Some cars are equipped with weapons such as the illegal spearhook designed to take out competitors. Vehicles glide through curves turn on a dime vault high into the air ride on their noses and otherwise comport themselves in physically impossible ways. All this indisputably augments the desired spectacle. But it doesnt stimulate excitement or suspense for the simple reason that you dont know what the rules are or what constitutes genuine jeopardy. Time and again Speed and other drivers endure what seem like catastrophic crashes and accidents only to simply keep on trucking without apparent ill effect. Repeatedly there are no consequences to road peril just continuous cutting to new situations and unvaried high speeds. The editing is so fast that this film alone will considerably reduce the average length of a sustained shot in Hollywood features. Stylistically the Wachowskis have devoted themselves here to lateral moves ushering big faces on and off the screen as if on a conveyor belt; the effect is attention-getting through sheer uniqueness. Clearly no expense was spared in the effects arena; viewers who love to bathe in the latest CGI innovations will be in a corner of heaven here even if the layering of brilliantly in-focus objects within a single frame at times resembles nothing so much as a kindergarteners art collage. Cinematographer David Tattersall who lensed the three most recent ""Star Wars"" entries knows how to get the most out of the new Sony F-23 HD camera and all technical hands had an evident field day. If Michael Giacchinos playful and busy score ever lets up for a minute during the movie its impossible to notice for all the other sounds booming forth. Cast is very good for this sort of thing not that much is asked of the actors other than to look alert and driven. In a far cry from ""Into the Wild"" Hirsch is well-scrubbed and appealing as the title character. As his loyal lifelong girlfriend Christina Ricci looks more fetching than ever positively radiating from the screen. Goodman and Sarandon are stalwart little Litt is a firecracker and Allam rather like a noncampy Tim Curry makes a delicious love-to-hate villain.
