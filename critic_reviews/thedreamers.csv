That syndrome is a liability in ""The Dreamers."" This elegant but pretentious chamber piece chronicles the obsessively sexual menage of a trio of self-absorbed youths. Bernardo Bertoluccis shift from exotic epics back to European settings has underscored the Ivory Tower syndrome in his later work depicting characters in situations of privileged isolation that make those films inaccessible to many audiences. That syndrome is a significant liability in ""The Dreamers."" Unfolding against but ultimately trivializing the political backdrop of the 1968 Paris student riots this elegant but pretentious chamber piece chronicles the obsessively sexual menage of a trio of self-absorbed youths offering sensuality but scant dramatic interest. Europeans may be intrigued but broader commercial outlook especially in the U.S. seems problematic. Originally skedded for a fall release in North America the film has been pushed back by Fox Searchlight to March with cuts reportedly being planned to avoid a restrictive rating. The steamy content and the central element of characters in the French capital on a carnal odyssey almost oblivious to life outside the apartment where their trysts take place inevitably recalls Bertoluccis ""Last Tango in Paris."" But any comparison will be withering for ""The Dreamers."" The earlier film examined questions of sexual politics class solitude communication and the power of purely physical relationships at the same time provoking shockwaves for audiences unaccustomed at the time to such sexual frankness. The eroticism and nudity are even more explicit here yet somehow oddly repressed for a film set during the sexual revolution. And the issues being addressed seem diluted. In fact the whole spirit of rebellion passion and protest that should be a driving force for the characters plays more like a cultivated affectation. Their insatiable love of movies seems no less mannered as portrayed here. The three students ride the crest of the nouvelle vague playing guessing games that revolve around their favorite film scenes. But rather than conveying a giddy sense of artistic discovery these digressions -- often accompanied by clips from the films in question -- add an even more intangible feel to the characters tiny world. Its hard to find a dramatic point of entry in discussions of Keaton vs. Chaplin or what Godard said about Nicholas Ray. Focal point of the triangle is Matthew (Michael Pitt) an American student in Paris soaking up film culture and the heady mood of the moment as anticipation builds for the changes afoot during the spring of 68. At a protest following the government sacking of Cinematheque Francaise director Henri Langlois -- with Jean Pierre Leaud appearing against newsreel footage of himself at the time -- Matthew meets flirtatious French babe Isabelle (Eva Green) and her twin brother Theo (Louis Garrel). The trio become an instant unit. Infatuated with his French friends despite being mildly disturbed by their ambiguous physical closeness Matthew shacks up with the siblings when their liberal-intellectual parents leave town. Like Bertoluccis father the twins pere (Robin Renucci) is a poet whose conflicted relationship with Theo adds autobiographical shadings. Matthews inhibitions soon dissolve as he falls under the spell of his more free and easy friends and into Isabelles bed. But their confronting sexual and emotional games create increasing friction with Theo slowly destabilizing the group. Not the most down-to-earth of writers Gilbert Adairs screenplay -- inspired by his novel ""The Holy Innocents"" -- displays no ear for natural dialogue. And the discussion in his script of period issues such as Vietnam and Maos China seem almost extraneous to the trios journey. As a result the film never develops any real sense of political atmosphere and the characters climactic involvement in the riots comes out of nowhere. More effective is Matthews gradual awakening to the shallowness of the twins world questioning their refusal to emerge from their sheltered environment and incestuous games to summon real commitment to the issues they supposedly care about. Countering the frustratingly impressionable side of his character with burgeoning intelligence Pitts alert watchful performance to a certain extent provides the film with some ballast and a sense that at least one of the characters grows from the experience. But while all three look lean and alluring artfully draped naked across the apartment and each other Green and Garrel never get beyond their characters irritating bratty surfaces making them tedious company. These may be the two most humorless uncharming kids on the planet. As always with Bertolucci the film is meticulously crafted on all technical levels most notably in the gorgeous opening titles interwoven with city structures like the Pompidou Centre. Period reconstruction throughout is stylishly achieved and coolly rendered in d.p. Fabio Cianchettis deep saturated colors and dense visuals. Period music is aptly used to evoke the mood of the late 60s.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Starring Michael Pitt Eva Green and Louis Garrel. Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. (NC-17. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Bernardo Bertoluccis ""The Dreamers"" is an ambitious and exciting piece of work a movie about sex and movies made by a filmmaker who understands the power of each to set off fantasy create addiction incite danger and transform the spirit. The film also touches on politics but politics at a time when politics was also inseparable from fantasy -- the spring of 1968 in Paris -- a period of student protest and riots. Three young cinephiles shut the door of their Paris apartment and barely leave it creating an emotional and sexual psychodrama as the world outside beckons threatens and influences their interaction. Bertolucci and screenwriter Gilbert Adair dont try to re-create the physical world of 1968 so much as the 1960s mind-set. Its all there within those four walls the idealism and the irrationality the naivete and the hostility and the blithe assumption of personal rectitude occasionally interrupted by a nagging sense of soul-corroding depravity. In that way the 60s have rarely if ever been conveyed so well with such genuine feeling for the periods romance and such unblinking willingness to expose its spiritual laziness and self-delusion. Of course in ""The Dreamers"" there are worse things than self-delusion. Illusions help make youth fun. Theyre to be indulged until that moment when they become corrupting and untenable. Then reality must be faced and dreamers must become adults. Related Stories Paris 1968 -- revolution is in the air -- as is youthful sexual exploration So that no one has to skip ahead it should be said at the outset that ""The Dreamers"" is rated NC-17 and that it comes by its rating the old- fashioned way It earns it with full-frontal nudity (male and female) and convincingly simulated sex scenes. Yet the movie seems neither prurient nor the product of a filmmaker with sex on the brain. Rather the sex in ""The Dreamers"" seems part of a larger picture the desire of the characters for some grand communion which they try to achieve through physical means but which is best embodied in an imaginative sense by their ravenous passion for movies. The film evokes those pre-video days when seeing a rare old film at a repertory house was a major event. Michael Pitt plays Matthew a young American who haunts the Paris Cinematheque. Its there that he meets Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel) twins and fellow film fanatics who admit him into their world. ""One of us one of us"" they say quoting the famous chant from Tod Brownings ""Freaks."" On a couple of occasions Bertolucci has the camera trail behind the three of them so that we share some of Matthews anxiety about wanting to keep up with his glamorously French friends. The three talk about films constantly arguing about the relative merits of Chaplin and Keaton (Theo prefers Chaplin; Matthew Keaton) and re-enacting moments from films theyve seen. In one oddly exhilarating little sequence the three run through the Louvre repeating a scene from Godards ""Band of Outsiders."" As films are discussed or re-enacted Bertolucci cuts to brief snippets from the original movies using the clips not as points of reference but as a way of depicting how these fragmentary moments little sparks of consciousness can light up the imagination. I have never seen a film that better captures the interface of movies and real life and theres something thrilling in that. I had to catch my breath when Bertolucci brings in the soundtrack to Mamoulians ""Queen Christina"" just as Isabelle begins imitating Greta Garbos famous ""memory"" scene. Movies so often thought of as mere escape can also become the language of our peak experience a means of defining our great moments. ""Matthew my love"" Isabelle says at one point ""my first love. My great love. My great lover. My Valentino."" In five mental steps an average young man is transformed into a Platonic ideal. Of course he isnt and yet he is too. Behind ""The Dreamers"" is a faith that life is as big as movies and that movies are as big as life. The sex -- the inevitable consequence of youth proximity and a shared desire to raise the stakes -- begins with a couple of dares and the movie progresses from there. The three become their own band of outsiders insular and freely physical. Matthew who is for the most part the audiences eyes and ears tries to plumb the mystery of Isabelle and Theos intense bond which borders on the pathological. The young cast is capable and vivid enough to make one forget that anyones acting. Some may lose patience with the frequent banter or with the political discussions in which each competes to out-anger and out-naive the other. Not a whole lot happens in a story sense but the characters are always moving forward. In the end even those not in love with ""The Dreamers"" will have to admit that Bertolucci has made a movie he probably would have liked as a young man and that his young protagonists would certainly like even if they werent in it -- one thats passionate ungainly and full of ideas. Advisory This film contains strong language drug use full frontal nudity graphically simulated sex acts and violence.

The Dreamers Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-dreamers-2004,200,thedreamers11,thedreamers,rogerebert
"Passion for cinema carries lusty Dreamers - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Passion for cinema carries lusty Dreamers By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  February 13 2004 ""The Dreamers is very much a young mans movie which is strange since the man who made it is 63. But Bernardo Bertoluccis films have been getting more impassioned and adolescent with the years. ``The Conformist and ``Last Tango in Paris now look like works of towering maturity next to the empty stateliness of ``The Last Emperor and ``Little Buddha while those films are light-years removed from the panting teen-boy crush on Liv Tyler that is ``Stealing Beauty.``The Dreamers isnt that bad - actually its funny affecting interestingly twisted and seriously erotic before it heads south in the final stretch. Its also the first major studio release to hit theaters with an NC-17 rating in seven years but if the eroticism here is more provocative and explicit than say a passing glimpse of Janet Jacksons right breast its also more recognizably human. In ``The Dreamers sex is whats on everyones minds when they talk about politics art and movies.Especially movies. Adapted by Gilbert Adair from his 1988 novel ``The Holy Innocents ``The Dreamers is a coming-of-age tale for a generation that grew up intoxicated by the visions streaming off revival-house movie screens. Its set in 1968 Paris and begins at the fabled Cinematheque Francaise where Matthew (Michael Pitt) a callow young American student sits up front at every show so he can get the rush faster.Matthews in the streets too after Henri Langlois the shambling head of the Cinematheque is ousted by Minister of Culture Andre Malraux - only in 1968 France would riots break out over old movies - and in the tumult he meets the dark brooding Theo (Louis Garrel) and Theos ravishingly lovely sister Isabelle (Eva Green). Eva is wearing a red beret and has chained herself to the gates of the Cinematheque and if theres a headier image of the hot-wired allure of cinema revolution and sex that was a certain corner of the 1960s Ive never seen it.Theo and Isabelle take Matthew home to their parents book-lined warren of an apartment. The American moves in; the parents leave for a holiday; the sexual tension and movie references grow and tangle together like kudzu. Outside the events of May 68 fill the streets while Hendrix and Joplin pound like Furies on the soundtrack. Inside the trivia contests lead to kinkier variants of Truth or Dare. This is a film where failing to identify Marlene Dietrich in ``Blonde Venus has unexpected consequences.The sex scenes in ``Dreamers are luminous and charged with the electricity of young people playing rainy-day games while their parents are out. Yet they never truly lead anywhere and thats part of Bertoluccis point. Matthew Theo and Isabelle slowly run out of money and food but theyre too busy indolently shagging and arguing over Chaplin and Keaton to care. The movies a paean to the infantilism of the revolution - a portrait of a generation drifting out to sea.Where another director might be critical of such gorgeous children Bertolucci indulges them. He loves the hothouse air in the apartment the casual nudity the weird humor of some of the sex. He also loves the characters for their youth but its the youth of the actors that let him down. Pitt has the passive hunkiness of a male model or a hustler in a Warhol movie; the script hints at his depths but shies from any real evidence. Green goes more out of focus the less she wears With her clothes off shes just a beautiful young woman naked but with her clothes on she has the carnal impact of an electromagnetic pulse.The more genuine love object in ``The Dreamers is cinema itself. Clips from Hollywood and French classics punctuate the film - ``Shock Corridor ``Breathless ``City Lights  ``Top Hat  ``Freaks Godards ``Bande Aa Part Bressons ``Mouchette - and when Isabelle moves slowly about her bedroom memorizing the furniture neither Matthew nor acolytes in the audience need to be told that shes imitating Garbo in ``Queen Christina.Bertolucci doesnt cite ``Les Enfants Terribles the 1950 collaboration between director Jean-Pierre Melville and playwright Jean Cocteau but he doesnt have to. ``The Dreamers is in many ways a remake of that feverish classic of emotional incest only with more overt politics and far less danger. The films final minutes return Matthew Theo and Isabelle to the streets for a glib unconvincing wrap-up but clearly the directors heart and hormones are back in that mossy apartment and you can feel the opportunity for something grander sharper and wiser slip away. Bertolucci has crafted a film so nostalgic for the blindness of young lust that it ends up blinding itself.(""The Dreamers"" )Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"Godard and man in The Dreamers. Slate Sign In Sign Up Godard and man in The Dreamers. Godard and man in The Dreamers. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 6 2004 1207 PM Godard and Man in Paris The movie world meets reality in Bernardo Bertoluccis The Dreamers. By David Edelstein Blood is thicker--and redder--than water In The Dreamers (Fox Searchlight) Bernardo Bertolucci has a tantalizing subject for his sensuous camera style and psycho-erotic sensibility In just the first two minutes you get passionate cine-mania a violent political demonstration and a whiff of sadomasochistic sex. The young American narrator Matthew (Michael Pitt) has come to Paris in the spring of 1968 to watch movies at the Cinematheque with what he calls a ""Freemasonry"" of film lovers He wants to sit smack up close to the screen he says so he can receive the images while theyre fresh and new--so that their power doesnt dissipate as they pass from row to row. That sounds pretty woo-woo but Bertoluccis shots feel so vivid that you might be sitting in that metaphoric front row too. Even when he mixes in images from other films of Jean-Luc Godard Josef von Sternberg Charlie Chaplin and others Bertolucci makes them part of his characters inner lives so theyre almost as real (or maybe more real) than the world outside. And as you drink them in Bertolucci probes the locus of the dream world and the real world in a way that reaches back to the early days of the French New Wave. Advertisement The Dreamers is based on a novel called The Holy Innocents by the sometime film critic Gilbert Adair who adapted it for the screen--and who has unprecedentedly rewritten it into a book called The Dreamers. (The actors from this movie must have nudged his original dreams out of the picture.) The title characters are Matthews fellow movie lovers Theo (Louis Garrel) and Isabelle (Eva Green)--a dark sultry intense couple who Matthew meets during a violent demonstration after the government fires the outspoken director of the Cinematheque Henri Langlois. (She turns Matthew on by pretending to be handcuffed to the gates of the Cinematheque.) It turns out that Theo and Isabelle are not boyfriend and girlfriend but brother and sister the children of a well-off French poet (Robert Renucci) and his English wife (Anna Chancellor) who are rather indulgent (in that 60s-liberal way) when it comes to their kids eccentricities/perversions. When the parents head off to their summer place they leave the youngsters alone in the dark rambling book-lined townhouse which has long corridors like the castle of Cocteaus Beast. Outside the streets of Paris erupt in bigger and more violent protests. Inside these borderline incestuous siblings admit Matthew into their freaky psychosexual playpen (complete with interpolations from Tod Brownings Freaks) where he explores the connection (or lack thereof) between uninhibited sex and existential freedom (a recurring Bertolucci motif). The director his cinematographer Fabio Cianchetti and designer Jean Rabasse push this stuff as far as they dare into dreamlike territory--but tell that to the MPAA. Much of the media talk about The Dreamers has focused on its NC-17 rating and while theres no hardcore action the squirm factor is off the charts. This is one of those movies where the lovers show how unihibited they are by eating the sleep out of each others eyes and getting smeary with various secretions. Theo and Isabelle are constantly giving each other pop film quizzes For example the penalty for Theo getting it wrong is having to masturbate in public to a poster of Marlene Dietrich. And then theres the scene in which the three lie naked in bathwater turning red with Isabelles menstrual blood That must be a motion picture first. The bisexuality in the novel (Matthew and Theo get it on) is here only a tease but the hetero stuff is explosive Greens Isabelle strikes one deliriously self-infatuated femme-fatale pose after another and shes so voluptuously beautiful that its no wonder Matthew goes along for the ride. How you take all this depends I suppose on your proclivities I found it alternately a huge turn-on and kinda gross and Im pleased to say that Matthew does too especially when the siblings punish him for not guessing the source of some movie quotation by trying to snip off all his pubic hair. He comes to see his beloved Theo and Isabelle as on the infantile end of the spectrum Ericksonially speaking. More important Matthew hears in Theos Maoist recitations a childish egocentricity on the political spectrum. This is where Bertolucci the old Communist might surprise you. When Theo says that Maos Cultural Revolution is like a glorious movie in which people carry books instead of guns Matthew points out that its not books its one little red book and that everyone is dressed identically and sings the same songs. Everyone in that glorious movie he maintains is an extra. Now Matthew sounds a bit smug to me. I dont have a problem with his renunciation of Maoism and revolutionary violence. But I think its the 60ish filmmakers talking with 20/20 hindsight not the anti-Vietnam-War American trying to sort it all out in the middle of this tumultuous moment. Bertolucci and Gilbert Adair seem to have left out a few psychological transitions and the lines theyve left in go thud. It doesnt help that Pitt is miscast. He has a great wide-open Leo DiCaprio-like face but he doesnt give off feverish intellectual vibes Hes an inarticulate stoner type. Garrel isnt much more appealing. (Green is mouthwatering and then some.) Its fascinating to see Bertolucci on the verge of denouncing the counterculture that a third of a century ago liberated him as an artist In the end he seems to suggest that certain movie-fed 60s radicals took to the street with more Godard than good sense. (The same idea is echoed in TheBarbarian Invasions another ""We Were Godardists Once ... and Young"" movie.) With its lyrical interpolation of old film clips The Dreamers celebrates movie love then goes on to show you the perils of a medium that cant help but favor masturbatory fantasy over political reality. It doesnt entirely gel but few directors could explore the collision of the ego and the outside world with such sympathy or purpose. Its possible that the NC-17 has never been used to such PG-13 ends. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

His credentials as a political filmmaker were established a decade earlier by his 1964 breakthrough Before the Revolution. He is also as steeped in movie history as virtually every important director of his generation. (Related video Go behind the scenes of The Dreamers) Michael Pitt Eva Green and Louis Garrel in a scene from The Dreamers. Fox Searchlight Pictures So The Dreamers ought to be more of grabber than it is with its sexually earned NC-17 rating a story set against the 1968 student riots in Paris and impressively integrated clips from Hollywood and French masterpieces. The storys three movie-obsessed protagonists act these scenes out in youthful homage. Were this trio more appealing the film would be a better test case for NC-17s commercial feasibility. While the rest of Paris is just outside their door protesting Henri Langlois sacking after years of service to the Cinematheque Francaise our French twins and the more stable American student they ""adopt"" are inside living out fantasies. Well the movie is called The Dreamers. As the American Michael Pitt is less of a screen force than he was in Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Of the twins (Louis Garrel and Eva Green) Green is an interesting case because shes the daughter of actress Marlene Jobert (Charles Bronsons Rider in the Rain co-star) and looks nothing like her. About the movie The Dreamers   1/2 (out of four) Stars Michael Pitt Eva Green Louis Garrel Robin Renucci Anna Chancellor Director Bernardo Berrolucci Distributor Fox Searchlight Rating NC-17 for explicit sexual content Opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles You start thinking of this kind of thing because the siblings in particular grow so irritating with their cultural tunnel-vision that even the films explicit sex grows monotonous and its lack of humor grows irritating. And yet the movie feels authentic to its time in a way that plays to Bertoluccis strengths. The soundtrack is fabulous Janis Joplin The Doors and Bob Dylan -- and not just any old Dylan but Queen Jane Approximately. The film clips are equally great including the original Scarface Robert Bressons Mouchette and even The Platters performing Youll Never Never Know from The Girl Cant Help It. The problem is the letdown you feel when these glorious morsels end and its back to three morose schlumps.

Shes protesting the firing of Henri Langlois the institutions founder. Matthew is lost without an old movie to light his lonesome days. Not to worry Matthew. Isabelle and her saturnine brother Theo (Louis Garrel) have a sort of home movie -- no camera but lots of sex and nakedness -- that they think might be fun to make in their parents apartment. After the clueless mother and father depart on vacation the kids shed their duds their inhibitions and such political consciousness as they have. The demirevolution of the spring of 1968 begins to gather riotous force outside their windows while they play mainly degrading sexual games indoors. Eventually they find themselves eating garbage. Eventually Isabelle flirts with suicide. Eventually a revolutionary rock tossed through their window awakens the dreamers from their dream and the French pair is last glimpsed throwing Molotov cocktails at the gendarmes. Eventually you begin to wonder what in the world has got into Bernardo Bertolucci.

This is a deliberately cramped and ugly film. The only Bertolucci film it somewhat resembles is Last Tango in Paris -- you know people shutting themselves away from the world to indulge their sexual fantasies. But that film which was rated X had an authentic sexual charge. This one -- which carries an NC-17 the modern equivalent of an X -- is grim and joyless though it is far richer and more casual in its display of both male and female frontalia. That leaves the viewer plenty of time to contemplate the films fundamental irony. While the youngsters are inside quite realistically acting out their fantasies real life (and death) is running riot in the streets. A lot of the threesomes games are inspired by the movies they saw at the Cinematheque and these passages energized by memorable clips are the movies best. They have wit and some satiric edge. But possibly because of budgetary restraints the film pretty much scants the revolution. It is a vague presence but never a persuasive dramatic force. One gets the feeling that Bertolucci who was in Paris during the 1968 May events feels duty bound (or nostalgia bound) to celebrate them. But as with sex so with politics. His heart doesnt seem to be fully in it. And in fairness why should it be? Hes a man in his 60s entitled to a certain ambivalence about say Chairman Mao and his Little Red Book. Or for that matter movie madness and sexual triads. That standoffishness (or objectivity) intermittently marks The Dreamers which is adapted by Gilbert Adair from his novel The Holy Innocents. But it also renders the film dispassionate curiously lifeless lacking the energy of either youthful commitment or a deeply engaged re-examination of the past.

Feeney Le Temps Retrouve Thursday February 5 2004 at 12 a.m. By F.x. Feeney Bernardo Bertoluccis new film The Dreamers is a wise high-energy conjuring of 1968 a year of culture-wide passion and communal daring unforgettable for anyone old enough to have shared those passions. Half a lifetime ago Bertolucci anticipated its looming fires in Before the Revolution (1964) in which a dreamy young man wishes to be part of the seismic changes he feels are about to erupt yet cant quite free himself of his ""nostalgia for the present."" Now working with a poetic and suspenseful script by Gilbert Adair based on his novel The Holy Innocents Bertolucci makes these same apprehensions and emotions live anew but refreshingly free of nostalgia. Documentary footage of the Paris riots of 1968 is dazzlingly intercut with precise re-enactments of those same riots. Actor Jean-Pierre Leaud speaking to a frenzied mob is juxtaposed with archival footage of his younger self giving the same impassioned speech to the actual mobs of 68. Such time-defying montages highlight a forgotten aspect of those historic riots -- that they began as a protest by movie lovers outraged at their governments harsh and idiotic meddling in the Cinematheque Francais. Over the ensuing weeks the turbulence flooded into every stratum of French cultural and commercial life until the Third Republic teetered on the brink of collapse. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - When receiving his Oscar for The Last Emperor Bertolucci called cinema ""this great cathedral we build together."" In The Dreamers he makes that idea come to life as we discover three young worshippers at the church of film their faces upturned in rapture before the same flickering light. As disorder intrudes their paths cross on the barricades and they swoon into an exotic mutually intoxicating love affair. Matthew (Michael Pitt) an American dodging the Vietnam War in Paris is as fascinated by the twins Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel) as they are by him. He is like the two beautiful and adventurous but unlike them shy and possessed of a strong autonomous inner life. Isabelle and Theo are by contrast theatrically aggressive in the ways of kids whove grown up fast in a world theyve closed unto themselves yet neither is inwardly free. Are the twins lovers? Leave it to Adair and Bertolucci to peel that psychological artichoke. What matters is that as Theo puts it ""We are Siamese twins of the mind."" Matthew becomes their houseguest as the pairs clueless indulgent parents (Robin Renucci and Anna Chancellor) disappear on holiday. Erotic games and pranks trigger brief clips from Top Hat Freaks Queen Christina and Band a part (to name but a few) as movies forge for this trio a shared daydream language that permits an uninhibited sexuality to emerge. The Conformist Last Tango in Paris and 1900 set a high bar for any filmmaker whos probed the mysteries of sex in their wake Bertolucci included. Yet here he surpasses himself in collaboration with his three brave actors as their souls are made visible in a barrage of carnal lightning-flashes. Among the pleasures the film evokes as few films have is the bliss of conversation. Matthew Isabelle and Theo argue about Keaton versus Chaplin Clapton versus Hendrix Marx versus America at length and to oblivion -- though Adair and Bertolucci never let these digressions become tedious. They are of a piece with the distressed wallpaper and the supple serpentine intrusions of music. As Matthew and Theo differ ever more vehemently one can feel -- beneath Adairs crystalline dialogue -- that Bertolucci is conducting a fervent fatherly argument with the long-ago self who made Before the Revolution. When Theo proclaims that Mao is no tyrant but the highest form of filmmaker directing the whole of humanity to march to the music of a single great feeling Matthew makes an equally passionate case against this incestuous utopia of shared minds. Under this one hears Bertolucci lovingly but firmly critiquing not just Mao but the movies which offer nothing if not the social euphoria of a shared dream.

Sep. 13 600pm One is tempted to call The Dreamers a young mans film in the flattering sense that the director at 63 still creates with the fire and muscle of a man half his age. Yet to invoke youth as an automatic term of praise feels a bit condescending in this context an insult to the vitality of Bertoluccis mature vision. If anything this seasoned rebel has overthrown the passage of time with the same fervor with which his younger self challenged the man-made orders of the world.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.
