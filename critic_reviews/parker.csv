But hes spot-on casting in the role of master crime writer Donald Westlakes taciturn and ruthless professional crook on screen for the first time under the Parker moniker familiar from a shelf load of novels. When his cohorts betray Parker after an elaborate heist they make the mistake of leaving him alive so we know that a bloody inexorable trajectory of revenge will ensue. Statham is the man for the job untaxed by performance demands beyond his skill set while veteran director Taylor Hackford (The Devils Advocate Ray) dishes out the hurt with crunching precision. Unfortunately though the movie cant quite leave it at that. Jennifer Lopez is actually terrific as a cash-strapped Miami estate agent inveigling herself into Stathams unfolding scheme yet her presence brings warmth and emotional empathy welcome in other circumstances but surplus to requirements here. Overall it gets by but bets are hedged when single-minded efficiency and ice in the veins would have been enough.

It just has the feel of a film made by focus group rather than a genuine artistic film. Its not bad just not very good. The fights and injuries would if not kill a man would certainly put Parker out of action for weeks. Worth two stars and probably 5 out of 10. I expected more from Hackford and his stars.

A routine thug convention called Parker is a complete master class by veteran director Taylor Hackford in how to turn a yawn into a snore. Hes made some memorable movies in his day (An Officer and a Gentleman White Nights Ray). This is not one of them. Based on Flashfire one in a series of overrated crime thrillers about a hard-boiled career criminal named Parker concocted by late pulp-fiction writer Donald Westlake under the pseudonym Richard Stark it comes from the same typewriter that wrote the character into much better movies including Point Blank with Lee Marvin (1967) and Payback with Mel Gibson (1999). The name changed but the character was the same a ruthless rogue hell-bent on revenge but with a code of ethics. The concept is so old its hairy but the thing that turns it unbearable now is Jason Statham the bald unshaven marble-faced action star from the hokey stupid one-note Transporter franchise. He cant act and watching him try is one of lifes more masochistic tortures. Mr. Hackford doesnt know what to do with him and the movie is barely getting started when he gives up the struggle altogether. My sympathy knows no bounds. Parker begins with Mr. Statham heading an operation to rob the Ohio State Fair. Dressed like a priest and wearing a gray wig its the closest he gets to looking one step above the cliche of a chiseled thug. Betrayed beaten riddled with multiple gunshot wounds and left for dead by his gang he emerges miraculously to plot his revenge. All he wants is his share of the take--no more no less--and hell travel from one end of the map to the other to get it killing anyone who gets in his way. The trip takes him from Ohio to Florida where he searches for the hangout of the chief hood who double-crossed him posing as a Texas tycoon pretending to be shopping for a Palm Beach mansion with the aid of the kind of dirt-poor but breathtaking real estate agent you only find in movies with big budgets. (This one clocks in at 30 million and not a dollar of it is visible with a telescope.) The realtor doesnt come in until the second half of the movie. She is played by Jennifer Lopez who lives at home with her trashy soap-opera-addicted mother played by none other than Patti LuPone. None of this is even distantly plausible but the movie is so dull that its the first time I have waited in breathless anticipation for J.Lo to enter. Once she becomes part of the plot nothing improves but at least theres something swell to look at. A smoke puff of a romance begins but when she figures out how many people Parker has killed she asks ""How do you sleep at night?"" He narrows his eyes locks his molars and answers ""I dont drink coffee after seven."" Can you believe this dialogue was penned by John J. McLaughlin who wrote Hitchcock? When J.Lo discovers that Parkers former gang has switched gears to a 75 million jewel robbery she becomes his partner in exchange for a commission. The requisite violence bloodshed gunplay and broken bones that follow are numbingly familiar and the running time of less than two hours seems like more than two days. Taylor Hackfords sketchy edit-obsessed direction jumps time frames with such frequency you wonder scene by scene if youre in the same movie making the zero chemistry between the two stars totally understandable. Nick Nolte wanders in and out of the mix looking bewildered. The biggest problem with Parker is an absence of tone due in part to the complete lack of personality displayed by Parker himself as played by Mr. Statham like a paralyzed nerve. His working-class British accent sounds more like outback Australian. He never modulates his muttering but says everything with a locked jaw and he fires a gun like hes nonchalantly rolling a joint. J.Lo may be the best reason to see this movie. She works hard to appear perky and involved but kissing Mr. Statham looks painful like rubbing glossy lips across a steel brush used to clean charcoal off a backyard grill. For an old-fashioned crime thriller you need real pros. Mr. Statham is to acting what Taco Bell is to nutrition. Mr. Hackford must see something in Mr. Statham nobody else does but the ability to carry a movie on his own is my idea of misplaced faith--what Irving Berlin called putting all your eggs in the wrong basket. rreedobserver.com PARKER Running Time 118 minutes Written by John J.

This would be unfair however as ""Parker"" is generally fun to watch and an entertaining time at the theater if youre a fan of the genre. Perhaps its my Jason Statham bias or the absurdly low expectations any January film comes with but it was difficult not to appreciate the characters and fluidity of the effort. Poster quote ""Parker"" a film thats a little better than youd expect Parker (Jason Statham) lives by a simple ethos He always does what he says hes going to do and he expects the same from everyone else. This is the same character Mel Gibson played in ""Payback"" though he was named Porter back in 1999. Parker is not a good guy; in fact hes quite a violent human and he has no qualms with stealing cars or beating people up to get what he wants (or to exact revenge). Theyve given a slight head tilt toward Parker being a protector of innocents but overall hes still an anti-hero. This is refreshing as the ""good guy"" who kills for righteous causes has been done and overdone ever since the birth of the western genre and ""Die Hard."" A slight nitpick is the hilariously inaccurate use of geography. As a native Floridian I can tell you no one is taking a cab from Boca Raton FL. to Lake Okeechobee. Likewise The Breakers Hotel and The Boca Raton Resort and Club are considered to be interchangeable when back in real life they are a solid 45 minute drive away not even counting traffic. The characters of ""Parker"" would have spent most of their life in traffic if they made these choices. Its odd to include real-life landmarks and then get all the details wrong but it wont matter to 96 percent of the folks who buy a ticket so its hard to ding the oversight too much. The film also makes strange logical and character choices throughout. Parker impersonates a rich Texan for no apparent reason during about 30 minutes of the movie and hes also asked to go in on a job that doesnt make chronological sense. Theres an entire real estate surveillance angle that is mediocre at best. Finally certain phone calls and follow-up points are either not accounted for or simply forgotten within the script. Overall though theres more good than bad in the two hours ""Parker"" spans. There are two main thrusts of action the first being the action beat that opens the film. Its around 20 minutes long and fairly well done -- always nice to start a movie with solid momentum. The next plot direction involves a standard revenge tale. Parker has been wronged and he plans to both settle and steal the score. South Florida also brings along the films secondary lead Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez). The chemistry between Statham and Lopez is laudable far better than anything she managed on ""American Idol."" The typical ""big plan for revenge and riches"" is well established and executed so theres not much in the way of extraneous nonsense there. In the end were left with a matter-of-fact protagonist who is as direct as he is effective. Sometimes in life simple pleasures can be rewarding and thats certainly the case here. ""Parker"" is not a particularly innovative film but its no less effective for the blemish.

The protagonist of a series of thrillers by the author Donald Westlake writing under the pseudonym Richard Stark Parker the man is the supreme predator in the criminal jungle. Based on Flashfire the 19th book in the series Parker the movie begins with a heist at the Ohio State Fair after which our mock heros accomplices try to eliminate him for his cut. This only means more scars for star Jason Stathams tank torso as Parker survives to follow his former partners trail to Palm Beach where he finds the hideout in which theyre plotting their next job with the connivance of Leslie a local realtor-turned-accomplice played by a brittle funny Jennifer Lopez--Leslie keeps divorcee desperation at bay with a glass of white wine. Cinematographer J. Michael Muso contributes uncannily crisp deep-focus images of an American scene from strip mall to Italianate villa where everyday larceny is the law of the land. Of course there is the inevitable softening of the character as originally conceived as this Parker exhibits something of a moral code but Statham of the pure panther prowl and vigilant poise more than makes up for this when placed into action slowing the descent of a knife with the meat of his palm and performing miraculous sleight of hand-to-hand with a pistol clip.

Photo Credit Handout advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A thief betrayed by his gang returns for vengeance. BOTTOM LINE Youd think a star like Lopez would raise Stathams profile but her ditsy performance sinks this low-grade action flick like a stone -- not that it needed much help. CAST Jason Statham Jennifer Lopez Michael Chiklis LENGTH 158 Jason Statham plays the title role in ""Parker"" a thief who pummels his way through the underworld in search of the men who betrayed him. There is one obstacle however he cant overcome his co-star Jennifer Lopez. The minute Lopez appears on-screen ""Parker"" starts sinking and fast. As a ditsy real-estate agent named Leslie Lopez seems to be in a whole different movie a working-girl comedy full of high heels and morning lattes. As a result ""Parker"" winds up with the worst of both worlds Its pointlessly violent and nauseatingly cute. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Thats too bad because ""Parker"" starts out strong with a zippy heist sequence and the introduction of several enjoyable slimeballs played by Michael Chiklis Wendell Pierce and others. (The source material is ""Flashfire"" by cult crime novelist Donald E. Westlake.) But when Parker heads to Florida to find his targets the movie heads south as well. Thats partly because Parkers ridiculous disguise includes a Texas twang and a 10-gallon hat (Psst Youre not blending in) but mostly because his almost-romance with Leslie is even less convincing. Parker already has a girl (the safely hidden-away type played by Emma Booth) and Leslie seems rather baldly attracted to his money more than anything. That turns ""Parker"" into yet a third film a cynical portrayal of greed in post-bailout America. Parker a fake populist steals only ""from people who can afford it"" which apparently includes the Ohio State Fair. (Those fat cats) As for Leslie shes not just grasping and venal but amoral. ""I dont know what youre into -- kidnapping extortion robbery"" she tells Parker. And she wants in The films humiliating nadir comes when director Taylor Hackford (""Against All Odds"") tries to wake us up by making Lopez strip to her skivvies while Statham watches. He doesnt seem terribly interested. Neither are we.

Jack English/Film District hide caption toggle caption Jack English/Film District Parker Director Taylor Hackford Genre Crime Thriller Running Time 118 minutes Rated R for strong violence language throughout and brief sexual content/nudity With Jason Statham Jennifer Lopez Michael Chiklis (Recommended) In the strictest terms Jason Statham isnt the perfect candidate to play Parker the single-minded career criminal created by the late Donald E. Westlake (working under the pseudonym Richard Stark). Statham despite having built a career playing rough-and-tumble skull-busters is just too much of a big pussycat. As Westlake himself explained Parker is angry ""Not hot angry -- cold angry."" Statham with those inquisitive cautious eyes and that slow-burning purr of a voice can act cold but he can never be cold. Even at his coolest hes all heat. Then again you can use electricity to make ice which is pretty much what Statham does in Taylor Hackfords jaggedly satisfying thriller Parker. Based on Starks 2000 novel Flashfire this is a bruised knuckle of a movie; there are moments of unapologetic violence (including some nasty business with a scary little curved knife) that made me wince and squirm and want to leap out of my seat. Note to self Must see it again The story is as basic as a right hook Parker the quintessential loner-freelancer has taken a heist job that involves robbing an Ohio country fair. One of his cohorts (they include Michael Chiklis Wendell Pierce and Clifton Collins Jr.) angers him by unnecessarily endangering regular townsfolk. Parker can be the most ruthless of killers but he has to have a really good reason to take a life. Apparently never having read a Parker novel the thugs make off with Parkers share of the money. That sets him off on a stubborn quest thats less about the dough than about the principle of the thing; along the way his plan entangles struggling but superfoxy real-estate agent Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez) while his loyal behind-the-scenes girlfriend Claire (Emma Booth) steps in to bandage the occasional wound. Not as if he doesnt have enough of those already. If youve seen other film incarnations of the Parker character -- most notably Lee Marvin in John Boormans sharpened icicle of a movie Point Blank -- you know that hes one of those guys who as they used to say in the old Timex ads takes a licking and keeps on ticking. Parker has no first name but his middle name ought to be ""That Guy Should Be Dead By Now"" i As struggling real estate agent Leslie Jennifer Lopez is sunny yet strained giving her character an unnecessary layer of sorrow in this hard-boiled crime thriller. Jack English/Film District hide caption toggle caption Jack English/Film District As struggling real estate agent Leslie Jennifer Lopez is sunny yet strained giving her character an unnecessary layer of sorrow in this hard-boiled crime thriller. Jack English/Film District Hackford puts Stathams Parker through the paces here -- even at one point dressing him in a powder-blue suit and an oversized cowboy hat. But theres almost nothing you can do to make Statham unappealing. Fans of the Parker novels might have trouble with the way some characters are fleshed out (or not) here Shouldnt Claire be more of a no-nonsense moll and less of an ethereal hippie girl? And while Lopez is sunny and charming as always her character doesnt have to be so downtrodden. She needs to be a lot more Karen Sisco (the Elmore Leonard character Lopez played in Steven Soderberghs Out of Sight) and a lot less Maid in Manhattan. But Statham while an imperfect Parker hits enough of the right notes to keep the movie humming. In an early scene he calms a panic-ridden young security guard by assuring him that if he just stays calm hell live through the ordeal at hand and make it home safe. He describes what will happen after that The guy will be sitting on the couch watching himself on the TV news report with his arm around his girlfriend. In that reassuring rasp of a voice Stathams Parker paints a verbal picture of domesticity that sounds like nothing a tough guy like himself could ever have experienced. Or has he? ""Itll be a good night"" he tells the guard with finality. And Parker that man of few words always knows what hes talking about.

Westlake under the pseudonym Richard Stark know that the fictional character called Parker is a professional thief with excellent work habits. Hes precise and efficient. He also has a strict moral code Hes a cool killer for instance but he doesnt steal from the poor. Theres your ethics for you. On the assumption however that not everyone who goes to see Jason Statham in Parker is a reader of Stark the protagonist in this grinding business-like thing is made to say things more or less like ""Im a cool killer but I dont steal from the poor."" Usually he states his case before beating a guy senseless or knifing him or (a Parker favorite) shooting him. True to his code when hes feeling generous he only shoots to wound. Its just as well Parker voices his credo. Otherwise he might as well be Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher or Megatron in Transformers so indistinguishable is the man in this unremarkably generic insanely bloody and bullet-filled adaptation of the Parker novel Flashfire. The idea is P. does a heist with a bunch of other guys who double-cross him shoot him and leave him for dead. Bad move on their part. The not-dead fellow rebounds tracks the scum down in Palm Beach Florida (a chance to show huge expensive real estate) and demonstrates his get-the-job-done ethics by getting even. If you need a spoiler alert then youve walked into the wrong theater in the multiplex. Jennifer Lopez shows up in mighty fine figure-hugging skirts as Leslie a real estate agent who gets involved -- professionally only please -- after doing her own moral math. Leslie is divorced from a no-good man shes behind on her bills and she lives in a crappy condo with a yappy dog and Patti LuPone as her mother. Dont cry for her Who wouldnt want to go in on a job with a payoff that could free her from LuPones vague Hispanic accent? Its just a guess on my part but Id wager Lopez took the role longing for the glory that was hers back in 1998 when she starred opposite George Clooney in Out of Sight. Oh J.Lo -- now I do cry for her. The movie is a morals-free procession of bang bang bang and blood blood blood and men slamming each other with blunt objects and slicing each other with blades. Nick Nolte bloated and ravaged beyond repair shows up in a few scenes. So do Michael Chiklis and Wendell Pierce as bad guys Bobby Cannavale as a kind of dumb cop -- on and on in and out cash those checks. You know how these days Hollywood folk want to open a ""dialogue"" to ""discuss"" a ""question without answers"" about whether and how pop movies ""contribute"" to todays ""culture"" of gun violence? They can start by answering the ""questions"" of 1) whether this unredeemable indie-conglomerate project needed to be made and 2) if so did it need to be made with such lavish and almost gleeful attention to hurting killing bleeding and loading bullets. The answers are 1) no and 2) no. But maybe thats just my moral code getting in the way of fun. C?

"Parker | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; parker ) Parker (United States 2013) January 25 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Parker delivers just about what the average viewer would expect from it a Jason Statham-flavored action thriller (as opposed to say a Matt Damon-flavored action thriller or a Rock-flavored action thriller). Statham like John Wayne in his heyday and Arnold Schwarzenegger during the 80s doesnt feel compelled to challenge himself as an actor. This reticence fills a market niche and rewards his fans with bloody violent cinematic ""comfort food"" on a regular basis. Stathams movies hit more often than they miss. Parker falls into the same category as endeavors like The Transporter and Crank in that it will probably satisfy those who identify Statham as a draw but do little to expand his legion of followers. Theres nothing surprising or inventive about Parkers storyline - its a straightforward revenge/heist film that hits all the necessary beats and features a number of violent confrontations and solid action scenes. With an able assist from accomplished director Taylor Hackford (An Officer and a Gentleman Ray) Statham carries a film that doesnt demand much in the way of heavy lifting. The movie is based on the 2000 novel Flashfire by Donald Westlake (writing under his ""Richard Stark"" pseudonym). Although Parker appeared regularly in Westlakes novels (there are 24 of them) this is (sort of) his inaugural screen appearance. Parker stories have previously been adapted but none has retained the lead characters name. For example in Payback a version of The Hunter Mel Gibson played ""Porter"" not ""Parker"". In terms of the revenge-slanted rhythms of how Parker progresses its like Payback although the inclusion of a secondary storyline with Jennifer Lopez occasionally bogs down the narrative trajectory. Ultimately Parkers greatest weakness isnt the familiarity of the material but its tonal inconsistencies and inability to maintain momentum. Lopezs character is superfluous; the movie might have worked better without her. The movie opens in impressive fashion detailing the five-man heist of 1 million from the Ohio State Fair. Parker (Statham) is the leader. His team includes muscle guys Melander (Michael Chiklis) and Carlson (Wendell Pierce) the shaggy-haired Ross (Clifton Collins Jr.) and the sniveling Hartman (Michah Hauptman) who has connections in the Chicago mob. The job is successful but during the car ride home the other thugs turn on Parker. After being shot and jumping from a moving car hes left for dead in a ditch. But Parker isnt that easy to kill and with help from his old mentor (Nick Nolte) and his devoted girlfriend Claire (Emma Booth) he begins planning his revenge with a trip to Palm Beach where the rest of the gang is plotting a big score. While there Parker hooks up with Leslie (Jennifer Lopez) a desperate and ambitious realtor who wants a cut of whatever Parker is getting. Although Statham is playing Statham at least Lopez attempts to distance herself from the romantic comedy dead zone into which her acting career has tracked. This isnt a return to the form she showed in Out of Sight her silver screen high point but its at least better than tripe like Maid in Manhattan and The Back-Up Plan. The problem with Leslie isnt that shes badly acted but that she has no real reason to be in the movie beyond providing a little sex appeal (theres a gratuitous bikini underwear shot) and comedic relief. The character isnt well developed her potential romance with Parker is short-circuited because hes devoted to Claire and her role in the climax is incidental. The 15-to-20 minutes devoted to Claires backstory damages Parker slowing things down and turning what should be a breezy 90 minute romp into something overlong and uneven. Thats the downside of hiring a ""name"" like Lopez instead of a lesser-known actress the ego-driven need for her to have significant screen time. Parker includes copious amounts of exposition some of which is necessary and some of which could have been eliminated or reduced. The action scenes are crisply directed brutal and invigorating. There are several of them and in the aftermath of two Parker is left a bloody mess. He may have superhero tendencies but hes not indestructible. When one considers Mel Gibsons Porter in Payback its not hard to see the synergy between the two interpretations. Parker is an anti-hero but like all effectively portrayed anti-heroes we have no trouble rooting for his revenge to play out in a satisfying manner. Which of course it does.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Donald E. Westlakes Parker character has found his way out of pulpy novels and onto the big screen several times before with varying degrees of success--most notably 1968s Point Blank on the strong end and 1999s Mel Gibson vehicle Payback on the weak. Parker starring Jason Statham as the single-named vengeance machine takes its story from Westlakes 2000 book Flashfire though it grabs some establishing details from 1962s The Hunter the basis for the other two films. Statham stars as a thief with a moral code who gets double-crossed and left for dead by his crew. He reacts by exacting bloody stylish cucumber-cool revenge. After a solidly entertaining heist at a state fair Stathams new team--led by a growling inexplicably sweaty Michael Chiklis and abetted by The Wires Wendell Pierce--ask him to join a jewel heist then decide to kill him when he refuses. Statham reacts as he does in pretty much every movie hes in coolly assessing the situation and discerning how best both to survive and deliver punishment. (Also how to deliver clever gravelly quips.) He eventually tracks the crew with the aid of his crime-world mentor Nick Nolte whose few scenes could have been summed up with a quick phone call. But Nolte isnt as inessential as Jennifer Lopez Though ostensibly the female lead Lopez is so unimportant to Parkers plot that she could almost be removed entirely without causing a hiccup. She plays a broke real-estate agent who for reasons totally ridiculous yet laughably spelled out via a Lifetime Channel-level monologue (""I have a sister I havent spoken to in five years"") decides shes destined to help Statham carry out his plot. Though Lopez has no background or training in crime and seems mostly interested in hitting on him Statham agrees--presumably for the purpose of having Jennifer Lopez in this movie. Though Parker starts off fairly strong the action gets more predictable as it meanders toward its conclusion. Theres a clever scene in which Statham--charming and bad-ass as always--dispatches some mob-connected baddies whove found his fake-ID supplier but its followed by a rote hotel-room fight and a climactic battle that while sprinkled with a couple of cleverly choreographed bouts sticks to expected tropes. Its admirable that Parker--directed by Best Director nominee Taylor Hackford of Ray fame--would rather be Out Of Sight (or at least The Bank Job) than a by-the-numbers action movie like Taken but in the end it falls somewhere in the unmemorable space between.

"Parker (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Parker (R) Jason Statham is a nice match for the hero of the Donald E. Westlake novels. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com1/25/2013 Editor rating 3 Parker roars into a dull January and enlivens the movie landscape and thank the action movie gods because we needed a little something to wake us from our winter slumber. Based on a novel in a series by Richard Stark the alter ego of the late great Donald E. Westlake the film is basically a heist-and-payback movie. But its made with such skill and smarts that it stands above such eye-rolling blow-em-up fare as Arnold Schwarzeneggers The Last Stand its main competition at the box office. As played by the ever-stoic Jason Statham (the Transporter and Expendables films) Parker is more antihero than hero He operates on the wrong side of the law but hes got a complicated code of ethics. He will steal -- and quite unremorsefully -- but only from people who can afford it he says. If you stumble into one of the many crimes he commits he wont hurt you as long as you do exactly what he tells you to do. He doesnt go looking to hurt innocents. But all bets are off if you dont follow directions and woe unto anyone who dares to cheat him. A doublecross is precisely what happens in the opening scenes of Parker A crew carries out a daring robbery at the Ohio State Fair. The heist does not run smoothly -- not all the thieves in this bunch are as detail-oriented as Parker -- and after their escape the second in command the menacing Melander (Michael Chiklis of The Shield and Vegas) demands that Parker turn over his share of the profits to help finance the next job. ""Its the score of a lifetime"" he tells Parker. Like any sensible individual who hears those words Parker is skeptical. So he refuses and gets shot robbed and dumped at the side of the road for his trouble. The rest of the movie follows what happens when Parker recovers and decides to get his money back from -- and revenge on -- the guys who left him for dead. This requires him to figure out precisely what the next job is and where its happening. The road to payback leads him to Palm Beach County where the movie was partially filmed and into the orbit of Leslie (Jennifer Lopez) a real estate agent dying for her first commission. Directed by Taylor Hackford (Ray Proof of Life) Parker is not without its absurdities. Melander is resourceful but could he and his gang really commandeer a West Palm Beach fire truck? Patti Lupone goes a bit over the top as Lopezs super-ethnic mama and Lopez gets stuck with a couple of unfortunate ditzy moments courtesy of the script by John J. McLaughlin (Hitchcock Black Swan). But Statham not always the most charismatic of actors turns out to be a good choice to play the taciturn thief. He looks like the sort of guy who stands a good chance of getting out of any tight corner even if his assailant is armed and hes not. Even the people who griped about Tom Cruise being cast as the towering Jack Reacher will have to admit Statham fits nicely in Parkers shoes. Cast Jason Statham Jennifer Lopez Michael Chiklis Wendell Pierce Bobby Cannavale Patti Lupone. Director Taylor Hackford. Screenwriter John J. McLaughlin. Based on the book by Donald E. Westlake. Producers Les Alexander Steve Chasman Taylor Hackford Sidney Kimmel Jonathan Mitchell. A FilmDistrict release. Running time 118 minutes.

To a certain kind of crime fan -- the Black Mask boys the Black Lizard fans the folks for whom hard-boiled fiction can never be hard enough -- Donald E. Westlakes Parker is a kind of ideal. As silent and relentless as a bullet he sped through 24 Westlake novels all published under the Richard Stark pseudonym. And stark Parker definitely was as he coldly plotted capers -- and too often hunted down the people whod betrayed him. Hes shown up in a number of Hollywood films and the definitive best was ""Point Blank"" with Lee Marvin -- dead-eyed or maybe even really dead -- stalking through that film like a killer robot. So the news that hes reached the screen again -- and this time in the shape of English action star Jason Statham -- is enough to make purists spit. They shouldnt. The latest Parker film based on ""Flashfire"" has the professional thief leading four new partners on a heist of the Ohio State fair. All goes mostly according to plan -- until it comes to splitting up the take and the other crooks decide its easier to shoot Parker than pay him. Which is their first really big mistake. Not shooting him that is. But shooting him and making sure he isnt dead. Because now Parker has four targets and he is not going to stop until he has brought down every one of them. In the books Parker is supposed to be an American and the film makes no apology for changing him to a working-class Brit. But if you can get past that Statham is actually an excellent choice. Parker is nothing more or less than a lethal machine and the bullet-headed Statham even looks like one Just point and fire. Where the movie slightly goes astray is when Parker chases his ex-partners down to the scene of their next score Palm Beach. We get a new character -- a struggling real-estate agent played by Jennifer Lopez -- and a slightly different mood. What had been pure Westlake slides into Elmore Leonard Lite -- then lighter. Lopez is actually winning in the part -- more so than shes been in years -- and her character has some interesting angles. But theres really no reason for her to be here; the one function she serves (blurting out who the crew is going to rob) could easily have been introduced another way. Shes a pretty distraction and thats one thing Parker doesnt need. But Statham is good -- coldly no-nonsense and clearly able to handle himself in a fight -- and the film gives him some fine actors to play off including Nick Nolte as the old-timer who points him toward the first score and Michael Chiklis and Clifton Collins Jr. as two of the low-lifes he hooks up with. And although the movie has a hammy turn by Patti LuPone and some appalling post-production dubbing (dont sound editors even try to match the lips in longshots anymore?) its neatly directed by Taylor Hackford who keeps things moving quickly without letting them descend into a blur of cut-cut-cut edits. A veteran Hollywood director a major co-star a solid script -- is Statham finally breaking out of the cycle of endless remakes and unnecessary ""Transporter"" sequels? I hope so. In a world of pumped up hyped-up action stars Statham is one of the few who looks like a genuine man of action. Like Parker he gets the job done. And then he moves on. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Parker (R) FilmDistrict (118 min.) Directed by Taylor Hackford. With Jason Statham Jennifer Lopez.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 25 2013 1201AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 25 2013 1221PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Taylor Hackford Written by John J. McLaughlin Starring Jason Statham and Jennifer Lopez Classification 14A Genre thriller There is an opening scene in Parker where the title character disguised as a priest is preparing to rob the Ohio State Fair when he gets stopped by a carny who ropes in the nice padre to help a little girl pop some balloons with a dart. The priest hits the balloons with the ruthless precision of the safe cracker he actually is and the carny hands him the big stuffed animal he has just won. He passes the prize to the delighted little girl cracking barely a smile at her excited thanks. Screen grab from an online trailer for the film ""Parker"" Movies Parker The official trailer Moviegoers may empathize with that little girl The implacable Parker hands us our entertainment with the barest of smiles providing reliable thrills with mirthless efficiency.This time out British action star Jason Statham is playing another preternaturally tough and highly professional criminal as screenwriter John McLaughlin and director Taylor Hackford reanimate the remorseless thief first created by pulp-fiction author Donald Westlake (under the pseudonym Richard Stark). Westlake literary godfather to the caper and heist novels of Elmore Leonard was the author of 24 Parker books. This movie draws the broad outline of its plot from the first novel - The Hunter published in 1962 and previously adapted for the screen in the 1998 Mel Gibson movie Payback - and returns to the well-worn theme of honour among thieves.After the successful state-fair robbery Parkers accomplices insist he join them on their next assignment. When he declines they throw him out of a moving car shoot him a couple of times and leave him for dead. He is rescued from the ditch by some good Samaritans and makes it his mission to find his double-crossing associates and steal their big job out from underneath them. That takes him to Palm Beach where with the help of a unsuccessful real-estate agent (a badly miscast Jennifer Lopez) he discovers his former associates are planning an impossible jewel heist.The tight-lipped give-no-quarter Statham is impeccable as the pitiless yet honourable Parker (though fans of the books will no doubt quibble especially over the British accent). On the other hand Lopez that pleasant sex pot hasnt a hope of producing the tragic desperation of her down-on-her-luck character. True to his code Parker will remain loyal to his long-time moll (played by Emma Booth) so we are offered the impossibility of romance between the leads in a manner that just seems head-scratchingly flat rather than heart-tuggingly wistful.Its one of several spots where Hackford struggles to find an equivalency for Westlakes spare hard-boiled prose. Occasionally the director hits the right note of desiccated humour - like that bone-dry joke about unwittingly asking a crack shot to pop balloons - but often the film feels cheerless as it struggles to place the unflashy Parker in something as flashy as a 21st-century big-budget action flick. If the state-fair robbery is amusing the jewel theft that ends the film begins to feel merely frantic and the appearance of effort is just not Parker-esque.

Ben Affleck has sealed his remarkable career reinvention as an actor-director with the critically acclaimed ""Argo -- but things havent gone nearly so well for the film career of his former lover and ""Gigli co-star Jennifer Lopez. ""Parker a return to the thriller genre for her first film in three years isnt a jaw-dropping disaster like ""Gigli. But her silly ill-conceived role doesnt come within light years of showcasing her the way Lopezs best film Steven Soderberghs ""Out of Sight (1998) did. Though Jenny from the Block gets co-star billing with Jason Statham she makes only a token appearance in the first hour of a film adapted from a long series of hard-boiled crime novels by Donald Westlake. Several have been made into movies with stars including Mel Gibson Lee Marvin Robert Duvall and Jim Brown in the Parker role (although as in most of Westlakes novels theyre Parker using a pseudonym). But Statham is the first actor to play Parker under his ""real"" name. And at least for the first half this action flick looks like it might result in a new franchise for Statham. His lone-wolf criminal is somewhat reluctantly recruited by his girlfriends father (Nick Nolte sounding like he gargles with razor blades) to join a gang planning a complex heist at the Ohio State Fair. Parker ruthless but with his own peculiar set of ethics is dismayed that sloppiness results in the death of a civilian. When the leader of the gang (Michael Chiklis) insists that Parker join the others in investing the proceeds from the heist in another far more lucrative job Parker pointedly refuses. Chiklis orders Parker executed but leaves the job to the same inept gunman whose bungling resulted in the death. Which leaves a wounded Parker free to plot a way to hijack the second heist get his money and wreak a bit of vengeance in the process. Veteran director Taylor Hackford (""Ray) handles the first half tough and taut but lets things go ridiculous and slack when Parker tracks his former associates to Palm Beach. Thats largely the result of Hackford and screenwriter John McLaughlin accommodating a wobbly star turn by Lopez as Leslie Rodgers a cash-strapped Realtor whom Parker uses to try and figure out exactly where the gang plans to strike next. Outfitted in a 10-gallon hat and a terrible Texas accent Parker pretends to be an oilman looking for a trophy property. Leslie whos ""pushing 40"" (Lopez is 43 and looks it here) and shares a condo with her telenovela-loving mama (Patti Lu-Pone) sees him as a potential sugar daddy. Given her oil-and-water chemistry with Statham its probably just as well that Lopez isnt the films actual romantic interest. That thankless task falls to Claire (Emma Booth) leaving Leslie to look on helplessly while the girlfriend (literally) stitches up Parker after hes attacked by a knife-wielding assassin. Statham being Statham you can imagine what happens to the other guy. The films fantasy level goes into overdrive when the clueless Leslie finally somehow figures out what Parker is up to -- and he agrees to make her his partner never mind that Leslie is a complete ditz. This all leads up to a poorly staged jewel heist during a charity auction at a mansion -- with Parkers ingenious plans to get even predictably complicated by Leslies erratic behavior. ""Parker is watchable chiefly for Statham who exudes effortless cool and excels in hand-to-hand combat as well as demonstrating his skill at wielding some very unlikely weapons. And J.Lo? Well maybe shed be better off commissioning a script for a sequel to her last successful vehicle (in 2002) and calling it ""Matron in Manhattan.

"Review Jason Statham keeps Parker standing and fighting - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Jason Statham keeps Parker standing and fightingJason Statham stars as the criminal Parker who takes lumps and feels pain while he entertains. The violent film isnt without its huh? moments though.January 24 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Jason Statham left and Jennifer Lopez in a scene from ""Parker."" (Film District )In the new crime thriller ""Parker"" Jason Stathams high-end heister demands only one thing of mates and marks alike do exactly what he asks. No questions no debate no one gets hurt. He is literal a and lethal a on the subject.One particularly nasty confrontation with mob types who dare to disagree gives you a sense of the tone. Im pretty sure Parker breaks nearly all of a humans 206 bones.Through hes equally adept with guns and knives its the panache Parker brings to the bare-knuckle beatings a fashion-forward suits and starched white shirts a that make women swoon. Certainly longtime love Claire (Emma Booth) and beautiful broke Palm Beach real estate agent Leslie (Jennifer Lopez) are smitten.PHOTOS Celebrity portraits by The TimesPerhaps director Taylor Hackford who has set aside all restraint on the violence front for ""Parker"" offered to pick up the cleaning tab. In addition to splattering all manner of apparel Hackford has spilled so much red stuff on so many surfaces that while the movie wont stand among his best work a see ""Ray"" or ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" for that a it ranks as his bloodiest.In a time when the violence in movies is increasingly under fire ""Parker"" stands as one of those films that would be virtually nothing without it. Violence defines the main man drives the action shapes the story taints the relationships and begs the question why bother to make a film like this in the first place?The answer is found in the cult of popularity that already surrounds the character and the off-limits appeal of the smart sardonic thief first concocted by novelist Donald E. Westlake. Screenwriter John J. McLaughlin has rendered a faithful adaptation of ""Flashfire"" one of the 24 novels filled with Parkers meticulous schemes and personal machinations.The characters brutality has always been somewhat mitigated by his Robin Hood-esque code of ethics a steal from the rich help those who help you punish those who cross you. And Statham has a way of taking the sting out of the rough stuff which he has become very good at executing with wry asides often in Guy Ritchie films. It comes in handy here since that is Parkers style as well.The movie hangs on a series of elaborately staged stings a like the Ohio State Fair which opens the film with a crush of humanity pig races and beauty queens. As if that werent carnival enough there are so many costumes and charades required of Parkers crew to make off with the cash that in another movie theyd be Broadway bound. Its the kind of dense-with-detail scenes that Hackford working with director of photography James Michael Muro (""Crash"") loves to make hay with and he does.PHOTOS Hollywood Backlot momentsAs so often happens in Parkers world despite all his planning something goes wrong. Though hes technically running the show hes really the outsider. The other bad guys answer to Melander played by Michael Chiklis who is scary no matter which side of the shield hes on. Ross (Clifton Collins Jr.) is a nervous type and Carlson (Wendell Pierce) is a bit too laid back. But it is Hardwicke (Micah Hauptman) the spoiled nephew of a Chicago mob boss who decides he doesnt have to follow all of Parkers instructions.That is precisely what puts Parker in such a black mood on the getaway. Even the possibility of another score a 50 million in jewels begging to be stolen in Palm Beach a doesnt interest him. The conversation ends with Parker left for dead. One tomato farmer and one trip to the ER later and he is on the road to revenge which will keep the movies motor running.Its not about the money its the principle a Parker explains during an unexplained backyard barbecue with his mentor Hurley (Nick Nolte). This is only one of several ""huh?"" moments. But Ive found its best not to over-think things too much in movies like this.Though Lopez gets equal billing her real estate agent doesnt enter the picture until the mayhem is well underway. She was a sweetheart on ""American Idol"" and shes a sweetheart here and Im not being facetious. There is something so inherently likable about Lopez on screen that its easy to forget that she doesnt so much become the characters as they become her. It works well enough for Leslie an easy foil for Parkers toughness and gosh willing to strip down if she must to prove she is not wearing a wire.Leslie is 40 divorced living with her overbearing mom (an amusing Patti LuPone) but were not here to deal with Leslies issues. And shes smart enough to realize it. Soon shes signed on to help Parker settle that old score with Melander get a cut of the spoils and perhaps a little romance on the side. Its Palm Beach so there is glitz and there are boats but mostly there is more blood.I should mention that by this time Parker has been knifed beaten and shot multiple times so much so that there are moments he can barely walk. Mind you it doesnt dent his sex appeal but if youre going to saturate a film with so much violence at least its nice to see an action hero a or antihero a actually feeling the pain.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO The making of Argo Les Miz and more ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESChan-wook Park has a lot riding on blood-filled StokerFebruary 9 2013Parker offers standard Statham mayhem critics sayJanuary 25 2013Movie review The MechanicJanuary 28 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowViolenceParkerMovieCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-parker-review-20130125,0,5226790.story",200,parker19,parker,latimes

This is the first time Parker figures in a film adapted from one of Donald E. Westlakes many Parker novels. In the 1967 ""Point Blank"" he was called Walker and was played by Lee Marvin. In the 1999 ""Payback"" he was called Porter and was played by Mel Gibson. Westlake was protective of his hero when granting screen rights; only since the novelists death four years ago could the man without a first name be called by his rightful last name. In the current iteration hes played by Jason Statham an English action star whos capable of more nuance than he reveals in a role that turns on exacting revenge by inflicting--and suffering--pain. The essence of this grindingly violent movie can be summed up by what Parker says of his handgun to a terrified clerk at a check-cashing service ""Its small but it hurts."" A new street drug that sends its users across time and dimensions has one drawback some people return as no longer human. Can two college dropouts save humankind from this silent otherworldly invasion? (Photo/Video Magnet Releasing) When we see Parker for the first time hes disguised as a priest and part of a holdup gang that bursts in on the Ohio State Fairs offices to relieve the fair of its daily take. The films first grace note comes when a security guard whose life Parker has spared blurts out ""Thank you father."" (I also liked a quick cut of four pigs lurching out of the starting gate at a little porker racetrack.) But grace notes are few and far between in Taylor Hackfords brute-force direction John J. McLaughlins coarsegrained script and David Buckleys pitiless score. The cinematography is ugly too but that could be a function of a too-tight shooting schedule or the producers insistence on too-bright lighting so I wont finger the behind-the-camera perp. The theme of revenge--there is no other--grows out of the gang turning on Parker and leaving him for dead. The quest for revenge leads to Palm Beach. Thats where Parkers former comrades in crime are planning an elaborate jewel heist and where the movie takes a belly whopper into low-tide absurdity by introducing and constantly leering at a near-penniless real estate agent named Leslie who is played by Jennifer Lopez. The coupling of near-penniless and Palm Beach real estate agent is dumb enough but Leslie is in a dimwit class by herself and the actress is clearly uncomfortable in the role especially when her character embarks on a sodden soliloquy about being stuck in her career and hating her life. Back in 1998 Ms. Lopez spent a lot of screen time in South Florida as a U.S. marshal in Steven Soderberghs ""Out of Sight"" which seemed phenomenally smart and funny at the time and remains the gold standard for modern crime capers. ""Parker"" sets a tin standard for crime thrillers. A new street drug that sends its users across time and dimensions has one drawback some people return as no longer human. Can two college dropouts save humankind from this silent otherworldly invasion? (Photo/Video Magnet Releasing) John Dies at the End When you hear a song on the radio wheres the song? Thats one of the many questions posed by Don Coscarellis first feature since his cult hit ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" a decade ago. Another is how this little horror comedy which was shot for smallish change looks so good and sustains such a distinctive visual style with monstrous manifestations and genial gross-outs that arent up to ""Alien"" standards but arent cheesy either. Still another is how the film manages in the absence of a coherent plot to be so funny and engaging until somewhere around the midpoint it goes as flat as a stepped-on creepy-crawly. Which gets us back to a version of the first question When youre having great fun at a movie and suddenly youre not wheres the fun? ENLARGE Chase Williamson Magnet Releasing In this case memories of the fun do linger. Theyre compounded of situational dada (plots arent everything if you have nuggets of blithe nonsense popping up every minute); the effects of a street drug called soy sauce; and some deliciously deadpan performances especially that of Chase Williamson. He plays Dave one of two college dropouts who may be humanitys only defense against vile visitations--mainly crustacean visitations--from another realm. Much of the time Mr. Williamson seems to be doing next to nothing; his character a slacker Candide is either aghast or agog. What hes actually doing however is metering out emotion with a precision that belies his lack of experience; remarkably this is his first feature film. Rob Mayes is winning too as the other ad hoc ghostbuster John; he suffers from split identities--though with a shared personality--and remembers things that havent yet happened. Paul Giamatti gives the disjunct story a discernible framework as Arnie a journalist to whom Dave tells his lurid tale. The cast includes Glynn Turman Doug Jones Tai Bennett and in a cameo as a priest Angus Scrimm who played The Tall Man in Mr. Coscarellis ""Phantasm"" and its sequels. Mike Gioulakis did the cinematography. The point at which the film takes a sharp turn for the worse is when it starts to explain itself with a stab at narrative logic (in a sequence that puts Dave and John on alternate-universe thrones like Danny and Peachy in ""The Man Who Would Be King."") Too bad but probably inevitable. Anarchy defies scrutiny. --J.M. Watch a clip from the Israeli film ""Yossi"" the sequel to ""Yossi amp; Jagger."" Dr. Yossi Hoffman reminisces about his love ten years after his death. However he meets Tom who reignites his romantic feelings. (Photo/Video Strand Releasing) ENLARGE Ohad Knoller and Oz Zehav Strand Releasing Yossi Eytan Foxs romantic drama in Hebrew with English subtitles takes place 10 years after Mr. Foxs ""Yossi amp; Jagger."" In that film the covert lovers of the title were two young men serving in the Israel Defense Forces in Lebanon where one of them was killed in an ambush. Now Yossi (Ohad Knoller as in the earlier film) is a successful cardiologist but his life has lacked a strong pulse ever since. The same can be said of this sequel even though its an affecting and admirably unsentimental portrait of lost love. The contrast between the two films is instructive. ""Yossi amp; Jagger"" was barely feature length with a running time of 65 minutes. Still its story was dramatic and complex what with the lovers urgent need for secrecy the details of Israeli military life and the perils of the Lebanon war. (A brief turn by Hani Furstenberg as a flamboyant female soldier didnt hurt.) ""Yossi"" spends much of its 84 minutes with a passive hero. This older Yossi is a vestige of the man he once was an overweight and hollow-eyed vestige who drags himself through his daily rounds and solitary nights. Mr. Knollers performance is admirable and Yossi does find new reasons to embrace life. But his rebirth comes only after a very long requiem. --J.M. DVD Focus ENLARGE The Bank Job The Bank Job (2008) Jason Statham is Terry Leather a London car dealer with a vaguely shady past. An early scene in his garage shows one of his mechanics turning back an odometer and the movie does something of the same thing. It turns back the clock to the 1970s and to a gritty heist genre that eschews glitz and cutting-edge gadgetry for gimlet-eyed bank robbers who cut their way through masonry and steel with jackhammers and acetylene torches. Dont be put off by the generic title. ""The Bank Job"" directed by Roger Donaldson delivers more than it promises. ENLARGE Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (1988) Tim Burtons second feature is a supernatural comedy for the ages one of the funniest ghost stories ever made. At least half of it is--up to and including a dinner party whose guests are possessed by the need to sing ""Day-O"" Harry Belafontes Banana Boat Song. The second half is merely wonderful. Michael Keaton is sensational in the title role of a self-styled bio-exorcist. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are the couple who find themselves inconveniently dead and Winona Ryder is the hilariously morbid daughter of a yuppie couple who move into a haunted house. ENLARGE Brokeback Mountain Focus Films/Everett Collection Brokeback Mountain (2005) When it comes to defying cultural norms gays in the Israeli military are shoulder to shoulder with the American cowboys played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger. Although Jack and Ennis love each other passionately they cant live together in the Marlboro Country of the 1960s and 70s so they try to hide their love behind shaky facades of heterosexual domesticity. Ang Lee directed with eloquent simplicity from a superb adaptation of an Annie Proulx short story by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana. With Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams as the heroes uncomprehending wives. --J.M.

Parker review Blame it on J.Lo | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesParker review Blame it on J.LoIts not very often you can blame a bad movie on a secondary character. Jennifer Lopez earns that dubious distinction in Parker.Hoping Jason Statham and Jennifer Lopez would manage some Out of Sight chemistry? No such luck in Parker.  (Jack English / eOne Films)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 24 2013ParkerStarring Jason Statham Jennifer Lopez and Nick Nolte. Directed by Taylor Hackford. 118 minutes. Opens Jan. 25 at major theatres. 14AIts not very often you can blame a bad movie on a secondary character. Jennifer Lopez earns that dubious distinction in Parker dragging down what would otherwise be just another generic Jason Statham actioner.Until J.Los arrival midway through the picture in a Palm Beach detour that wearily becomes the main drive theres hope director Taylor Hackford and Hitchcock screenwriter John J. McLaughlin might have switched off Stathams cruise control.Article Continued BelowParker starts off promisingly enough with Stathams title character dressed as a man of the cloth as he and a band of knuckleheads rob the Ohio State Fair. The story is based on one of the many books in the Parker series by late author Donald E. Westlake.The scheme seems unnecessarily complex but more to the point why knock over a state fair? You do it when the gate and concession receipts amount to 1 million and the villains get to dress as clowns.The job does give Statham a chance to once again show off his brutal efficiency inherent decency and veddy British coolness under fire. Statham is the snack food of action stars rarely varying momentarily satisfying but ultimately unfulfilling.He barely breaks a sweat even after those aforementioned knuckleheads (Micah A. Hauptman Clifton Collins Jr. Wendell Pierce and The Shields Michael Chiklis) add treacherous disloyalty to their unsavoury aspects.Left for dead loaded with lead and apparently still without a functioning razor Parker is determined to get even with those who done him wrong.His quest leads him to Palm Beach and into the orbit of J.Lo who plays a downwardly mobile real estate agent named Leslie who is obliged to live at home with her nagging mama (a slumming Patti LuPone).Parker feigns a Texas accent and bank account as he plots payback by way of interrupting a high-dollar jewelry heist involving his former associates.Leslie is determined to meddle for business as well as amorous reasons but her presence as both comic relief and romantic interest falls harder than a tap dancer on January ice. The laughs just arent there and the problem with the romance part of it is that Parker is already smitten by Claire (Emma Booth) the daughter of his personal crime godfather Hurley (Nick Nolte).Evidently all concerned were hoping that J.Lo might rekindle some of the spark of Out of Sight her pairing with George Clooney in 1998 back when she was fresh and interesting to watch. No such luck. Parker just gets more violent and more predictable as the body count rises and the attention wanes.

Westlake. Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Updated Friday January 25 2013 934 AM Title Parker Film Info R Violence language nudity. Area theaters. At Wednesday nights premiere of ""Parker"" director Taylor Hackford (most recently an Oscar nominee for ""Ray"") introduced his latest movie as being ""unapologetically a crime-action genre piece."" All of that is true. Especially the unapologetic part. It seems clear that Hackford wanted to knock out a quick moneymaker something that would not require much energy but might allow everyone to pick up a nice tan. As such the cast is also in casual mode beginning with an appealingly wry but decidedly low-key Jason Statham. As tends to be the case with Statham his Parker is a principled villain the type of thief who comforts hostages even as hes stealing from them. Parker expects the same sort of consideration in return so when his new partners cheat him out of a payday shoot him and leave him for dead hes a little put out. He follows the crew (led by Michael Chiklis) down to Palm Beach where theyre planning a huge jewel heist. This is when nearly 40 minutes into the film Jennifer Lopez saunters through with no particular purpose other than to distract us from Stathams preposterous disguises. While in Florida hes pretending to be a Texas oilman or so his attempted drawl and giant white hat suggest. Shes a newly divorced real estate agent looking for a break and they agree to help each other. Jennifer Lopez and Jason Staham help each other out in Parker based on a novel by Donald E. Westlake. Under normal circumstances J.Los role -- a flirty flake introduced with the worlds most gratuitous strip search scene -- would appear so demeaning even an unknown starlet might pass. But its obvious Lopez wanted the chance to show off her still-fabulous figure without having to work too hard. (The memory of her fine performance in the infinitely superior ""Out of Sight"" hovers over this movie like an angry ghost.) Still a little more effort -- from anyone -- might be nice. The script based on Donald E. Westlakes ""Flashfire"" is pasted together with perfectly timed coincidences and miraculous recoveries. Nick Nolte Patti LuPone and Bobby Cannavale are among the actors who wander in occasionally only to be swiftly forgotten. Nearly every choice from the cheesy score to the jittery camerawork suggests minimal ambitions. On the other hand if you go in knowing what youre getting you should come out relatively satisfied. Our hero vigorously beats up a parade of bad guys. Lots of bullets fly. There are a couple of decently plotted thefts. And to tell the truth Stathams Southern accent is nearly worth the price of admission itself.

But more on her in a moment. Jason Statham stars as Jason Statham as Parker a master criminal who actually believes in honor among thieves. Thats why hes so furious and out for revenge against the quartet of hoods (played by Michael Chiklis Wendell Parker Micah A. Hauptman and Clifton Collins Jr.) who bungled their recent robbery of a state fair. Oh and they also shot Parker and left him for dead by the side of the road but that almost seems like a secondary offense to our hero. Parker tracks these goons to Palm Beach where theyre planning a complicated jewel heist and poses as a Houston billionaire in the hopes of getting real estate agent Leslie (Lopez) to point out houses that have been recently purchased for about a million dollars which was the take from the state fair job. Never mind that Statham has one of the least convincing Texas accents ever to be heard on the big screen; by this point in the movie thats small potatoes. The problem is that Leslie and her problems (divorced in debt living with her mom hates her job) feel completely grafted onto ""Parker"" for no apparent reason except perhaps opening up the film to a female demographic that would otherwise be turned off by this very violent movie; Statham as tends to be his wont on screen beats up a lot of people shoots many more and winds up bleeding as the result of several vicious attacks. Director Taylor Hackford is an old hand behind the camera but he shows no fluidity in going from say a clunky expository scene where Leslie spills her complaints to Parker over a glass of Chablis to an intense hotel-room skirmish in which Parker lets a knife cut through the middle of his palm as a way to keep from getting stabbed. The character of Leslie is made all the more extraneous by the fact that Parker already has a girlfriend (a personality-free pixie played by Emma Booth) -- just as well since Statham and Lopez generate zero chemistry. Its not entirely Lopezs fault; can you name any Statham movie where the female lead was more than window dressing? But the screenplay by John J. McLaughlin (""Hitchcock"") based on the popular novel by the late great Donald E. Westlake (writing as Richard Stark) gives Leslie two basic modes Squealing Idiot and Useless Hostage. (Parker has previously been brought to the screen in a variety of much much better movies including ""Point Blank"" ""The Outfit"" and even Godards ""Made in U.S.A."" where the character was rewritten as a woman and played by Anna Karina.) And dont even ask why Leslies soap-obsessed mother (Patti LuPone of all people) would give shelter and succor to a busted-up and bleeding Parker whom shes never met. If ""Parker"" had just focused on Parker and his bloody mission of vengeance they might have wound up with an unspectacular but still exciting action movie; Statham after all does this sort of thing about as well as anyone on the big screen this decade. Too bad the committee couldnt just settle for a serviceable horse and instead went for a completely ungainly camel. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
