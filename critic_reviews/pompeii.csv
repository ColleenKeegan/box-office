"Pompeii - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Pompeii Posted by Christy Lemire on February 23 2014 17 Comments Sony Pictures Rated PG-13 for intense battle sequences disaster-related action and brief sexual content. Running time 105 minutes. One and a half stars out of four Is it wrong to root for the volcano? Mount Vesuvius is the most interesting and expressive character of all in ""Pompeii"" a mind-numbingly dull and unintentionally hilarious sword-and-sandal epic/disaster flick/romance. (Who says you cant have it all?) Director Paul W.S. Anderson he of the ""Resident Evil"" franchise takes one part ""Gladiator"" one part ""Titanic"" one part ""The Horse Whisperer"" and pieces of various 70s end-of-the-world dramas mixes them all up and smothers them with cheese. And lava. In the middle of all this mayhem we are supposed to care about the blossoming forbidden romance between hunky slave boy Milo (Kit Harington of ""Game of Thrones"") and rebellious rich girl Cassia (Emily Browning). Their beauty is matched only by their blandness and when they stop to look longingly into one anothers eyes to pitch woo as Pompeii burns and collapses all around them youre more likely to giggle than swoon. I was also tempted to scream at the screen ""Run Run you idiots Quit canoodling and get the hell out of there"" No one would have heard me anyway over the films incessant roar. But first We get back story. As a child during ancient times Milo watched as marauding Romans brutally killed his parents and his entire clan of Celtic horsemen. Leading the charge was the evil Corvus played with scenery-chewing villainy by Kiefer Sutherland. Forced into slavery Milo transformed himself over the years into a quick and wily fighter becoming so famous and formidable that hes known simply as ""The Celt."" He also found time to go to the gym apparently as well as to the beauty supply store for hair product. Flash forward to 79 A.D. Milo and Cassia meet cute along a dirt road when the carriage bringing her home to Pompeii crashes severely injuring one of the horses. Milo whod been walking alongside the carriage with his fellow slaves in a chain gang bends down and puts the horse out of its misery. Naturally Cassia is instantly smitten. Their paths cross again at her familys villa where she has returned to live with her parents Pompeian power couple Severus (Jared Harris) and Aurelia (Carrie-Anne Moss) after spending a rocky year in Rome. Cassias family is throwing a lavish party as part of an annual festival with planned entertainment including gladiators beating each other to a bloody pulp and slashing each other to bits. Among them is -- you guessed it -- our generically sexy hero whos scheduled to battle to the death against the reigning champion Atticus (the intimidating Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). But of course because theyre supposed to kill each other they become best friends. (Long before the volcano goes boom ""Pompeii"" is extremely violent with a surprising amount of blood for a PG-13 movie. Im still not exactly sure why there were kids around 8 years old at the screening I attended.) Also in town for the festivities is Corvus whos now a corrupt Roman senator. This allows Milo to do his version of the you-killed-my-father prepare-to-die speech from ""The Princess Bride"" when he sees Corvus again for the first time since he was a child. But Corvus also has his eye on Cassia and insists on dragging her back to Rome to make her his trophy wife. All the while the volcano watches and waits and rumbles and grumbles. And when it finally blows it is a rather impressive spectacle to behold. (Say what you will about Andersons movies but he does use 3-D rather effectively.) Fireballs shoot in every direction sending the innocent people of Pompeii scurrying for safety. Some of them seem to have a GPS tracking system embedded within them they hit their targets with such speed and accuracy. And the pandemonium that occurs at the harbor when the fury of the volcanos force causes massive waves is admittedly a kind of awesome sight in all its glossy computer-generated glory. If only the people in peril were as engaging.

Ive never even heard of this movie. Thanks for the chuckle Reply February 23 2014  by  Christy Lemire     Thanks very much for reading We aim to entertain around here. Reply February 23 2014  by  JozieLee     Hahahaha. Christy that was hilarious especially because I plan to see the film. Ill look for hair gel Instant attraction and hoards with GPS tracking. LOL. So you might ask why Im throwing away good money for a B-flick . . . spurting lava gladiators wielding swords fighting til we see blood in 3-D. Give me great special effects and Im there. Reply Pingback The Tally Nothing can bust those blocks | coolihoma February 25 2014  by  Alison     Christy Thanks for the heads-up. The outside scenes were filmed in my neighbourhood. We loved seeing the old wagons horses amp; mules and warriors riding through our local countryside. To add to the humour - I understood that the town was buried under ash not lava. But imagine the unspectacular effects of grey ashes which rained down for 6 days. Reply February 26 2014  by  Dennis Ritchie     I enjoyed your review. I must confess I rooted for the volcano. I walked out of this movie and slipped into another poorly written Clooney farce and returned for the volcano eruption scene. I missed nothing in between. Thats how awful and denigrating this POS is. Who cares about the two lovers? They could have thrown in a softcore orgy scene very relevant to the times when Pompeii was at the height of its prominence. Definitely nude scenes and an R rating would have made it more watchable and more realistic. Sutherlands lame accentuation married to Moss looking organically modified and wooden only put this creation to a level of hilarity. Moss has never done much for me since her debut in Matrix (first one only) and she walks around Vancouver like anyone gives two ...it is her. Pull your head from your.... Moss. Hah Legend in their own minds. Even Sutherland s bad boy persona with his typical way does not help this movie. It simply hurts all over.... Pompeii deserves so much better. I would prefer it played out in Italian with unknown actors about a realistic family dying together. Period. Instead we get million dollar budgets with empty words and actions around a city where thousands of tragedies played out as ash buried people alive in a marvel of a resort town. Where is the pleasure in this town? And the CGI did not save this movie but made it passively watchable like those boring museum documentaries that recreate a place for our edification with vacant hollow extras. Do not waste your time on this Anderson creation. Pompeii needs another movie done pronto to wipe this one out of history. Reply February 28 2014  by  Doug     Dennis -- while the movie was not the greatest -- it was much better than your self serving review. Reply May 8 2014  by  WookieInHeat     ""I would prefer it played out in Italian..."" that would make about as much sense as them speaking english. the romans did not speak italian they spoke latin. Reply March 1 2014  by  Mike     Hair Product....great review..still chuckling Reply March 2 2014  by  P. B. Maxx     i think its o.k. to root for the volcano. i saw gravity"" yesterday and realized i was rooting for the space debris. Reply Pingback Pompeii (2014) | One Good Movie March 3 2014  by  Karl     Who is cute? ""Milo and Cassia meet cute"" Reply March 4 2014  by  Mark Ellam     Jesus thanks Christy I havent laughed that hard in a while- a full on roar. keep it up/ youve made a fan. Mark (cinematographer) Reply May 2 2014  by  Gilberto     Ive been waiting for a while for a good Saturday-afternoon B movie to try to recreate (and maybe rediscover) my interest in my adolescent love of the Hercules and Goliath movies of Steve Reeves and lesser know Italian actors. Pompeii sounds perfect. Reply June 13 2014  by  Jonny     Love the one line review on rotten tomatoes. Totally needed a laugh after such an atrocious film. Thanks Reply August 30 2014  by  Ben     To say I disagree with these reviews would be an understatement. Reply July 20 2016  by  Brock     Wow. What a miserable review. If a movie is bad then just point it out. I dont understand why critics like you try to be funny. You try to be funny and end up being unbearably miserable.

The structure of Gladiator is cribbed shamelessly as sullen slave turned fighter Milo (Games of Thrones Kit Harington displaying a six-pack of abs and five fewer facial expressions) draws the attention of Cassia (Emily Browning) a wealthy daughter of the city. Unfortunately such flirtations are frowned upon in the year 79 AD especially by rapacious Roman senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) who claims the young woman for his prize while ordering his guards to ""Kill them kill them all"" no less than twice. It feels like centuries before multiple horizon shots of the volcano coalesce into the full-on eruption were waiting for. Digital plumes of fireballs are impressive as will be your ability to detach from the human tragedy unfolding on the ground (onscreen I mean). Pompeii didnt have to be so boringly awful Director Paul W.S. Anderson has elsewhere displayed a flair for stylish nonsense particularly with Resident Evil (2002) in which the concept of ""supermodel versus zombies"" approached delirious purity. But his efforts here are trammeled. Theres not enough villainy--nor lip-smacking comeuppance--to justify a smiting by ash or falling column. The movie in your head melts ten times better.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Pompeii Video Rated PG-13  105 minutes  2014 In this sword-and-sandal actioner by Paul W.S. Anderson Mount Vesuvius erupts and a slave-turned-gladiator (Kit Harrington) woos a wealthy woman (Emily Browning) as Pompeii is destroyed. Anderson is fascinated by the human form (his Resident Evil series is an ode to the balletic movements of his wife/muse Milla Jovovich) and this fixation works its way into his visual style. The film is bookended by reverential shots of ash-encrusted bodies frozen in time and his muscular characters are all the more imposing in stereoscopic 3D. But narrative has never been Andersons strength; the story here is a corny overhaul of James Camerons already corny Titanic. With Kiefer Sutherland in hammy comic-book mode as the villain.

"Pompeii Fizzles But Is 3 Days to Kill the Start of the Costner Comeback? << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Pompeii Fizzles But Is 3 Days to Kill the Start of the Costner Comeback? Movies February 21 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print In the months leading up to the release of Titanic you could sense people rooting for a disaster -- not that the boat would sink but that James Cameron would. Some people wanted a big gassy mess that made you laugh because the acting was lousy the effects looked cheap and the story came straight from the back of a cocktail napkin. What those people really wanted was Pompeii which is what would happen if a blockbuster ran out of Cameron and had to start using Cecil B. DeMeh. The movie imagines a resort town in 79 A.D. full of shirtless slaves gathered to slay each other for the bloodlust of the masses. One is named Milo (Kit Harington) and hes such a fearsome gladiator that hes been imported from Britannia. Hes got a face that says ""Eric Bana"" a teased swept-over wet look that says Purple Rain and a way with horses that says ""Mount me."" Hes a Celt and some onscreen text tells us theyre stallion people. His whispering attracts a merchants daughter Cassia (Emily Browning) whos resisting the ooze of a Roman senator who wont stop getting on everyones nerves. Kiefer Sutherland plays the senator in full snivel. When he says ""games"" he makes you hear a ""y."" There are roles for Jared Harris and Carrie-Anne Moss as the merchant and his wife. Milo shares a lot of scenes with Atticus an indestructible fellow slave played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje an actor of imposing stature and comical swagger. Akinnuoye-Agbajes approach to this part is smart. Its ""What wouldnt Djimon Hounsou do?"" Its been awhile since the movies have had a big black buck role. This guy acts it with a knife and a fork. Every once in a while we check in on a groaning volcano and its bubbling pit. Tellingly the movie isnt called Vesuvius. ""Pompeii"" sounds like a place where soapy sexy stuff happens all the time -- like ""Dallas"" or ""Studio 54."" To that end Browning often looks like a woman on the brink of an orgasm. Its as if shes trying to out-act the volcano. The eruption starts early and lasts most of the movie. (Its tantric that way.) Occasionally a rock flies at you in 3-D or a falling pillar makes you jump. Its the equivalent of discovering that your giant bag of chips is mostly crumbs and air. No matter how much lava is afoot theres always time to impale one more person with a sword. Pompeii does make you wonder about what cataclysms people will be lining up for 2000 years from now. In the meantime director Paul W.S. Anderson and the three credited screenwriters dont know whether weve come to laugh cheer or cringe at the salad of violence villainy and romance. The result is an embarrassed sort of campiness. No vaguely campy blockbuster -- even one about a volcano -- should leave you feeling this way burned. Youve seen the ads for 3 Days to Kill the new Kevin Costner movie in which Costner shoots high-kicks and stunt-drives often with a scarf around his neck (hes in Paris) and I know what youre thinking Why only three days? Well thats more or less the amount of time hes got until the next installment of How Come People Keep Fucking With Liam Neeson? (commonly known as Non-Stop) opens. 3 Days to Kill was produced and cowritten by Luc Besson whose cartoonish action-thrillers practically invented Jason Statham and reinvented Neeson. Costner is hoping for the same. At 59 Costners got the next best thing to good acting great seasoning. His full hair has salt pepper and a dash of cumin. And time has kneaded wonderful creases around his eyes. Hes completely inexorably Kevin Costner which really means at least something in a movie this disposable. Some Besson films leave your head the minute they enter. This one doesnt even bother going there. It isnt enough that Ethan Renner the CIA agent Costners playing has to race around Paris trying to stop the sale of a dirty bomb. He also has to save his estranged teenage daughter (Hailee Steinfeld) from a sexual assault and then a scene later teach her to ride a bike at Sacre Coeur of all places. Hes got an ex-wife (Connie Nielsen) weighing on his heart a Malian family legally squatting in his apartment a sexy CIA handler (Amber Heard) on his back and cancer all over his brain and lungs. Besson and his cowriter Adi Hasak have written this movie so that the possibility exists that Heard is Death Christmastime is heaven and the dapper albino whom Ethan is hunting has escaped from a Bond movie. The director is McG and his talent for shootouts that empty dance floors and fistfights that demolish supermarkets is a cut above the Pierre Morels and Olivier Megatons of the Besson stable. Theyre cool but McG is crisp. Of course he seems to be holding his nose through all the maudlin father-daughter and ex-husband/ex-wife stuff but that occupies only about half the movie. None of it appears to bother Costner. Not even having to roll around sick on the ground three or four times while the camera affixed to his body takes stock of his pain. (Its the Kevincam) He might be the only star left in Hollywood who could take a role with this much ludicrous in it and perform the whole thing as though he were simply taking a bath. Neeson would need something true to play. Costner just plays himself. If youre in need of a palate cleanser and happen to be in New York City before the 27th the second and final week of Film Comment Selects is under way. The programmers have chosen a handful of new and old films from Jane Campions Top of the Lake which works as both a fine television serial and a procedural art-house epic to Fat Shaker Mohammad Shirvanis unclassifiable possibly allegorical experiment about an obese Iranian father who abuses his deaf son and the woman who tries to intervene. Theres also Me amp; You something new by Bernardo Bertolucci that doesnt seem like much -- a moody teen introvert (Jacopo Olmo Antinori) skips a class ski trip to spend a week hidden in his familys second apartment. Then his junkie half sister (Tea Falco) shows up to detoxify herself. Like I said its not much but Bertolucci gives the film a restless elegance that constitutes depth. If youve never had a chance to spend 90 or so minutes with the perceptive German director Christian Petzold Film Comment Selects presents two of his early films -- 2003s Wolfsburg and 2005s blunt haunting Ghosts -- that have been previously unreleased in the United States. His movies are mostly centered on strong women and the damage done to them. (His last drama released here was 2012s Barbara with Nina Hoss whos in most of Petzolds films as a banished East German physician.) He can go off the emotional deep end but he makes the leap feel like a talent. One of the highlights of the schedule is ""Healthcare Mayhem"" an institutional double bill of Blake Edwardss The Carey Treatment and Arthur Hillers The Hospital. Theyre both absurdly entertaining left-wing mysteries. Paddy Chayefsky wrote the latter and its another wry thunderclap with prime George C. Scott basically doing Zeus in a lab coat. The Edwards has James Coburn as a Boston doctor purportedly looking into the investigation of an abortion gone fatally wrong. But there are enough red herrings to pickle and put on a sandwich. One of them is Jennifer ONeill as a sexy nutritionist who smells too good for Coburn to remember what his assignment is. The script is by Harriet Frank and Irving Ravetch (who used a pseudonym) and based on Michael Crichtons A Case of Need which he also wrote pseudonymously. Edwards tried to go for the trifecta and at least have his name removed. Theyre all crazy. Its very 1972 especially the racism. But Hollywoods not making many even semi-serious topical dramas anymore. This one holds up even when its forgotten what the topic is. In Enemy Jake Gyllenhaal gets together again with his Prisoners director Denis Villeneuve to play a professor in Toronto who becomes obsessed with an actor who looks just like him. The movies based on a Jose Saramago book and Villeneuve gives it just enough airless surrealism to be both outlandish and creepy. Hed probably never do it but this is a guy you wouldnt mind making a movie about volcanic eruption. Hed at least make sure Vesuvius was the star of Pompeii.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 21 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 21 2014 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson Written by Michael Robert Johnson Janet Scott Batchler and Lee Batchler Starring Kit Harington and Emily Browning Classification PG Country USA Language English Pompeii has served as a morbid theme park for tourists for the past 250 years or so a place where you can stroll through the ancient Roman streets visit the bakeries and brothels and stare at the gnarly grey plaster casts of corpses of former Romans frozen in their last agonies. Its all a bit like a grisly movie set and has often been a favourite subject of films and television shows including the setting of a 1971 Pink Floyd concert film. Now we have a new Pompeii movie from Paul W.S. Anderson (Resident Evil) a mindless but watchable fondue pot of high-calorie visuals and ready-made plotting a tale of love in the lava with the poor-boy/rich-girl plot of Titanic the brawny battles from Gladiator and the flying projectiles of a vintage video arcade game. As an Anglo-friendly entry point to this ancient mayhem we begin as a shaggy-haired Celtic boy witnesses the slaughter of his tribe at the hands of Roman soldiers led by the sneering Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) and his henchman Proculus (Sasha Roiz).Jump forward 17 years and the kid has grown up to become a gladiator named Milo (Kit Harington from Game of Thrones) a.k.a. the Celt sporting long flowing locks and abs so chiselled any self-respecting Roman sculptor would reject the look as excessively idealized. En route to Pompeii from Londinium where he was recruited for the gladiator big leagues Milo makes the acquaintance of Cassia (Emily Browning) and makes a warm impression on her when he breaks the neck of an injured horse. Cassia is the pampered daughter of local Pompeii developer Severus (Jared Harris) and Aurelia (Carrie-Anne Moss) who are anxious to marry their daughter off after her gap year in Rome.At the same time Corvus the Celt-killer is visiting Pompeii as a senator for the new emperor Titus. As played by Sutherland with a smug manner and a fey nasal British accent Corvus might better be named Sleazius Maximus. His assignment in Pompeii is to evaluate whether the city is worthy of a major investor in its infrastructure which would benefit Severus. But no sooner does he lay his eyes on the milky-skinned Cassia than he lets her father know that a side deal may be required for the Roman coffers to open.Meanwhile in the gladiator cells Milo meets his chief rival and eventual ally a massively muscular African named Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje of TVs Lost) a champion who has been promised his freedom after this last death-match victory in the ring. With Atticus working for his freedom Milo out to avenge his family and save Cassia and Cassia defiantly avoiding a forced marriage theres a lot of pressure building up.Before the mountain gives the city its mighty kick in the ash pit there are a few tender moments as Milo and Cassia go on a rustic horse ride. Theres also some tumult in the arena where Milo and Atticus dispatch a Roman legion or two as the gladiatorial games go a little off-kilter and turn into a prerevolutionary rally. Finally after an hour or so the mountain cracks belches and spews forth screen-filling fiery 3-D lava bombs grey ash and black clouds. For good measure theres also an earthquake and tsunami making this sort of a one-stop disaster movie.No doubt the audiences in the Coliseum would offer a thumbs-up to the scale of the destruction though even they might have had some quibbles about the special effects which too often resemble a very large pile of melting crayons.

Andersons latest is gloriously exciting kitsch. 159 Shares Share 109 Tweet 49 Share 1 Share Email Print Share Photo Constantin Film International GmbH and Impact Pictures More fun than any civilizations fiery extinction should ever be Paul W.S. Andersons Pompeii 3-D is gloriously exciting kitsch - a poor mans Titanic crossed with an even poorer mans Gladiator. We all know about the explosive demise of the titular Roman city turned to ash and stone by the eruption of nearby Mt. Vesuvius back in 79 A.D. Over the years its captured the imagination of many artists particularly E. Bulwer-Lytton whose 1834 novel The Last Days of Pompeii inspired many (very loose) theater and film adaptations. Previous film versions have tried to add poetic dimension to the tale of this decadent citys comeuppance. Often as in King Kong visionaries Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsacks 1935 film or the classic 1959 Italian peplum starring Steve ""Hercules"" Reeves (and ghost-directed by Sergio Leone) the story becomes one of Christian sacrifice overcoming Roman venality on the eve of an apocalypse - an end-times tale in microcosm. But the fiery calamity at the end is the thing always. We see early glimpses of the volcano in this new Pompeii bubbling and smoking well in advance of the third act - which lends the films simple tale of love and revenge an aura of doom. The story proper starts in the British Isles where a young boy named Milo watches his parents slaughtered by Romans during the Rebellion of the Celtic Horse Tribes. Captured as a slave Milo (played as an adult by Game of Thrones Kit Harington) grows up to become a gladiator known as The Celt whose prowess buys him a one-way ticket to the decadent resort city of Pompeii. As presented here the town is a colorful atmospheric wonder nestled at the foot of the hulking Vesuvius - you get religion just looking down the street and seeing that godlike mountain looming in the distance. Also headed to Pompeii are the beautiful aristocrat Cassia (Emily Browning) not to mention Senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland doing what appears to be a Donald Sutherland accent) the man responsible for slaughtering Milos parents so long ago. Milo and Cassia have a meet-cute over a dying horse and its love at first sight. But Senator Corvus wants the girl for himself. And because Cassias father (Jared Harris) is a public official eager to renew Pompeiis infrastructure and thus dependent on the Senators pull and largesse our heroine is soon promised to the evil sneering Corvus. Meanwhile Milo becomes best friends with Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) the African slave he will soon be forced to fight to the death. As manly men do in films like this the two playfully joke over which one of them will die tomorrow. Thats not a particularly original story but it gallops along at a nice clip with the good guys appropriately gallant and breathless and the bad guys appropriately smug and snarly. Soon enough axes and spears and bodies are flying through the air. And whether its elaborate gladiatorial battles or a chariot chase through a burning city Anderson directs with precision rhythm and ruthlessness - he has an eye and an ear for violence for the visceral impact of a kill. At his best he creates action sequences in which you feel anything might happen even though you usually know how theyll turn out. And the ones in Pompeii are more engaging than those of any superhero movie I saw last year. But all the combat in the world cant quite match the sheer scale of the destruction of the films finale as 3-D fire and ash rain from the skies tsunamis consume throngs of innocents and oceans of lava lay waste to forests and buildings. Anderson is not an engineer a la James Cameron or a humanistA a la Steven Spielberg - you will find none of the intricacy of a Titanic or the mournful grand scale of a War of the Worlds. Rather hes more like a young boy playing with his action figures watching them melt and burn with a combination of horror and glee. And he does so with style letting the volcanic calamity enhance his characters in obvious though still compelling ways. The bluster of gladiators becomes macho poetry when uttered in the face of this fiery cataclysm. Meanwhile the disaster renders the villains even pettier and the devoted lovers even more romantic. That is all as it should be. From Bulwer-Lytton to Leone the Pompeii story has never not been schlock It aint the Bible and it aint Homer. In this gorgeous silly exciting new version it finds its level. Pompeii 3-D wants merely to entertain. And it does proudly.

(Caitlin Cronenberg) C+ Pompeii Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Jared Harris Kiefer Sutherland; Director Paul Anderson (Director); Release Date Wide 02/21/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 104; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor TriStar Pictures Posted March 8 2014 -- 1200 AM EST Pompeii the new historical-kitsch disaster movie raises the question Is there something about ancient settings that inspires actors to act badly? Or is it just that in a movie where everyone knows that theyre destined to be upstaged by a volcano theres a tendency to either pile on the ham or fade blankly into the crumbling melting scenery? Pompeii is set in 79 A.D. in the outlying Roman metropolis that sits just under the gaping crater of Mt. Vesuvius. Most of the film is a chintzy but watchable B-movie knockoff of Gladiator with Kit Harington the English actor from Game of Thrones mustering very little in the way of facial expressivity in the role of Milo a slave-gladiator whose Celtic family was slaughtered by Corvus a nasty Roman officer-turned-senator played with smarmy superiority by Keifer Sutherland. In Gladiator Russell Crowe proved for all time how an actor can simmer and throw lightning bolts with his eyes. Harington knows how to handle a broadsword but mostly he comes off as the British Taylor Kitsch a glorified fashion model striking Blue Steel poses that smolder boringly. Hes supposed to fall for Emily Browning who plays the sheltered-princess daughter of Pompeiis leader (the always excellent Jared Harris). Browning looks tiny on screen but still has a vivid presence with cheeks and lips that are one part Geena Davis one part Angelina Jolie. The romance itself is utterly rote but then the entire movie is basically foreplay leading up to that epic eruption. When Vesuvius finally does blow its top theres plenty of impressive CGI but the films innovation is that we dont get rolling rivers of lava. Instead the volcano spews an endless shower of fiery asteroids trailed by smoky plumes -- an apocalyptic fireworks show that takes down the city. Walls collapse buildings collapse the ground collapses and it all comes down to Sutherland racing through the rubble inferno with Browning in his chariot trailed by Harington on a horse that might as well be a motorcycle. The end of the movie borrows from of all things Lars von Triers Melancholia as the spreading fire-cloud of Vesuvius consumes everything in its path. Bodies get frozen into sculptures of ash that will last forever. Its supposed to make this love story timeless but by the end of Pompeii youll be grateful that the movie only lasts 104 minutes.

"Pompeii | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pompeii ) Pompeii (United States 2014) February 20 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Pompeii is a big glorious cheesy mess. A fusion of Gladiator and Danteas Peak it canat decide whether it wants to be an action film about coliseum combatants or a disaster flick. Predictably by trying to be both it ends up being good as neither. The movie is reminiscent of some of Hollywoodas bloated historical epics of the past with Cleopatra coming to mind. In fact Pompeii might be worthy of the dubious label of aguilty pleasurea if the truly awful 3-D didnat dump it into the ahard to watcha category. Pompeii unfolds in 79 AD. For anyone unaware that the volcano Vesuvius is about to erupt director Paul W.S. Anderson makes sure that the mountain is visible in seemingly every shot. He populates the city with a series of thinly-drawn types. Thereas the hunky young gladiator Milo (Kit Harrington) who is driven by a thirst for revenge. Fellow arena fighter Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is one victory away from becoming a free man. Noblewoman Cassia (Emily Browning) has spurned the advances of the callous Senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) and keeps casting meaningful soulful glances at Milo. As for the Senator he happens to be the evil man who put Miloas parents to the sword. In a way it seems a little pointless watching the struggles of these people play out since we know theyare all doomed. When it comes to dealing death the mountain canat be trumped. It seems that director Anderson whose past credits include classics like Mortal Kombat Resident Evil and Aliens vs. Predator fancies himself the next coming of James Cameron. The storyline follows the Titanic template and includes forbidden love between a low-class boy and a rich girl a scenery-chewing villain with absolutely no redeeming qualities and a big special effects-rich disaster with genuine historical roots. While the romantic elements of Pompeii never quite get off the ground - due in large part to the lack of scenes shared by the two leads - itas fun to watch Vesuvius get all hot and bothered as it blows its stack and rains Wrath of God material all over the poor city. Apparently the Roman deity Vulcan wasnat happy with Pompeii. With the majority of the filmas budget having been invested on the special effects there wasnat anything left over to hire any big name actors. Kit Harrington is well-known to those who watch HBOas Game of the Thrones where he plays Jon Snow and likely unfamiliar to everyone else. Heas an Orlando Bloom type and not much acting is required of him here. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays the stern veteran gladiator with just the right amount of dark humor and cynicism. Emily Browning doesnat leave much of an impression in her Kate Winslet-inspired role. And Kiefer Sutherland with a ridiculous accent goes so far over the top that you need binoculars to see the apex of his ascent. Visually the most notable negative to be laid at Pompeiias feet is the hideous 3-D treatment. Not only does the 3-D add little depth and definition but it darkens an already dim movie and makes everything look brown and murky. On one occasion I took my glasses off to see if they were smudged. For anyone who wants to see this picture 2-D would be the way to go. Pompeii offers pretty much what one would expect from a summer-type would-be blockbuster being dumped unceremoniously into theaters in February. Despite opening with genuine quotes from Pliny the Youngeras first-hand account historical veracity is not one of Pompeiias objectives. The clichA(c)-riddled screenplay works as an homage to bad disaster movies and Andersonas direction owes more than a passing debt to Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich. Ultimately Pompeii isnat juicy enough (nor will it be successful enough) to inspire a rash of copycat movies. Too bad really. I was looking forward to Krakatoa.

Now from the director of ""Resident Evil Retribution""... No that ad campaign doesnt really work does it? Neither does ""Pompeii"" unfortunately an epic without stars that staggers along as a bad version of ""Spartacus"" (the cable show not even the movie) before turning into a videogame version of a disaster movie all tiny running figures and big fiery projectiles. You might think that a volcanic eruption which destroyed a thriving city of about 20000 (not to mention poor disrespected Herculaneum) would be enough to hold the cameras attention. Would be enough of a catastrophe to fill a single film. You witless barbarian. No lava isnt enough for ""Pompeii."" We have to have earthquakes. Tidal waves. And a collision of `70s bad-movie cliches so massive and shameless all thats missing is Charlton Heston as a brave centurion or Richard Chamberlain as an evil Roman architect. (Or at least George Kennedy as a lovable old gladiator.) Instead though we get Kit Harrington from ""Game of Thrones"" who looks like Eric Banas much duller kid brother and Emily Browning who doesnt look like much of anything except someone who has trouble keeping her toga modestly arranged. He is a poor Celtic orphan sold into slavery; she is the spoiled daughter of a Pompeian real-estate developer. They meet cute when her carriage gets stuck in a muddy rut and he kindly breaks her horses neck. (Dont ask.) And before you can save amor vincit omnia... Neither young star gives this dusty relic any life at all however and the surrounding players are definitely low on star power. Jared Harris and Carrie-Anne Moss play the mild maidens parents; Kiefer Sutherland is the sibilant and hissable Roman villain. No one embarrasses themselves -- well at least Harris and Moss dont -- but neither do they add the sort of knowing camp that you could always depend on John Dall or Peter Ustinov to insert in something like this. Instead they take this trash seriously. Audiences will have a harder time doing that particularly when the director gives in to his cheap action-movie roots and love of excess. Its a spectacle all right -- but mostly just of a lot of people some of whom should know better making an utter ash of themselves. Ratings note The film contains violence and sensuality. Pompeii (PG-13) TriStar (105 min.) Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. With Kit Harrington Emily Browning.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Pompeii Paul W.S. Anderson--cinemas premier purveyor of video-game-indebted spatially constrained short-time-frame action fantasies--tries his hand at large-scale destruction and historical romance yielding mixed results. Love stories arent Andersons forte and neither is lengthy exposition; fortunately Pompeiis second half is tailor-made for Andersons established skill set unfolding over a matter of hours with many scenes set in and under a gladiatorial amphitheatre that recalls the arenas subterranean tunnels and cavernous vessels of Andersons best movies.  Distrust of remote power--a common feature of genre movies about groups in peril--is the closest thing Anderson has to a consistent theme. In Pompeii the Roman Empire functions as the latest in a long line of sinister military-industrial corporations which are a frequent presence in the directors work. The movies villain Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland speaking with a British accent which somehow makes him sound even more like his father) is an envoy whos traveled to Pompeii to meet with businessman Severus (Jared Harris) about investing Roman funds in the citys aging infrastructure.That infrastructure ends up playing a major role in the movie. Anderson cant help but turn the open-air urban setting into yet another deathtrap tunnel system and CGI aerial shots dot Pompeiis opening stretch showing the complex grid of roads narrow streets and aqueducts which make up a Roman city--and through which of course the characters will eventually have to escape. Miniatures like the floor-sized war game in The Three Musketeers or the city mock-ups in Resident Evil Retribution are one of Andersons visual obsessions part of his fixation on enclosed spaces and compressed stories. Its unsurprising therefore that when Corvus and Severus meet to discuss business its in a room full of architectural models.Trying to suck up to his Roman guest Severus stages a re-creation of one of Corvus military victories--yet another miniature--in the citys amphitheatre pitting a small band of unarmored gladiators (representing the tribesmen Corvus massacred) against a larger group armed with military weapons and shields. Among the unlucky ""tribesmen"" is the movies putative romantic lead (Kit Harrington) a champion gladiator known for much of the movie only as ""the Celt."" Unbeknownst to Corvus the Celt is the lone survivor of the original massacre. Hes also in love with Severus daughter Cassia (Emily Browning) whom Corvus wants to marry. A volcano is about to erupt. Everyone has swords. A viewer who cant figure out where this is going should schedule an appointment to have their eyes and ears examined.Neither the lukewarm Celt-Cassia romance nor the movies many early scenes depicting upper-class Roman life and slave-master relationships (which smack of Julian Fellowes who was brought on to rewrite the script) seem to engage Andersons visual imagination. They do however give the director--one of the most effective spatially aware 3-D stylists--plenty of opportunities to compose deep-focus shots around colonnades and windows. Secondary protagonist Atticus (a scene-stealing Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) provides some much-needed pulp flavor; a hardass shit-talking loner fixated on freedom he makes for a better Anderson hero than the Celt.Thankfully Anderson gets to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius about as quickly as he can considering the over-burdened first act. Its here that the movie snaps to. Rather than going the Roland Emmerich ""big tableaux of destruction"" route Pompeii reduces the disaster to a series of steeplechase set pieces fiery debris raining into the 3-D foreground as the characters scamper over bodies and ruins or try to outrun a ship thats been forced inland by a tidal wave. Like its directors horror hybrids Pompeii values self-determination over survival which makes for better brisker less convoluted genre storytelling. What matters to Anderson is the urge to escape not the destination--an idea that is hinted at in the movies talky backstory-heavy opening and which becomes palpable as Anderson turns his attention to crafting zippy sequences where characters struggle to flee a city collapsing in on itself.For thoughts on and a place to discuss plot details not talked about in this review visit Pompeiis Spoiler Space.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1138pm on Thursday Feb. 20 2014 Thursday Feb. 20 2014 Thursday Feb. 20 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Pompeii is cinematic junk food the moviegoing equivalent of convenience-store tacos or baseball-park nachos. Theres little nutrition but depending on your mood it hits the spot. And thats the best that probably can be expected from this cross between Gladiator and Volcano.In fact anyone even casually familiar with Gladiator or Spartacus will know how Pompeii begins. Milo aka The Celt (Kit Harington Game of Thrones) is a feisty Briton who was been dragged to Pompeii by the Romans to be a gladiator after his entire tribe has been slaughtered. He earns the wrath of his minders because of his bad attitude and desire for revenge. One of his fellow gladiators champion Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje Oz) cant wait to turn him into arena road kill.Meanwhile Cassia (Emily Browning) the fairest maiden in all of the city has taken a fancy to Milo. Maybe its because Cassia a lover of horses has seen that he is as gentle with horses as he is brutal with men. Or maybe its just because she has seen his abs.Her father Severus (Jared Harris Mad Men) is desperate to attract more investment in town and is trying to impress visiting Roman senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) the man who oversaw the destruction of Milos village to put in a good word with the emperor. But faster than you can say ""toga party"" cruel Corvus is more interested in getting to know Cassia better much to the horror of her mom Aurelia (Carrie-Anne Moss The Matrix).All of this bad blood is threatening to come to a soapy sword-and-scandal boil on the day of the big gladiatorial showdown. But then Mount Vesuvius rumbling angrily throughout has a better idea lets just destroy this town under a noxious rain of ash and flame. Thatll be a better show.Director Paul W.S. Anderson (the ""Resident Evil"" movies) working from a script that somehow took five people to concoct doesnt take too much of this seriously. He knows anyone coming to this movie wants to see two things fights and mass destruction -- with just a little bit of a love story thrown in. He delivers on all counts even if the 3-D as usual seems superfluous.Whats more amazing than any of the special effects or 3-D is how Milo and Cassia -- despite going toe-to-toe against centurions and a volcano -- are just as pretty near the end of the film as they were at the start save for a few smudges on their cheeks. (And the movie is not even too bloody. as its only PG-13).But then Pompeii has as much to do with realism and history as the average gas station has with gourmet cuisine and fine dining. If youre hankering for something substantive youll leave hungry. Cary Darling 817 390-7571 Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Pompeii Director Paul W.S. Anderson Genre Action Adventure Drama Running time 98 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense battle sequences disaster-related action and brief sexual content With Kit Harington Emily Browning Kiefer Sutherland Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje You can say this for director Paul W.S. Anderson He gets the basic purpose of 3-D movies. While the current renaissance in cinematic stereoscopy is touted as a method for creating more ""immersive"" experiences for audiences the list of movies that achieve that lofty goal can be counted on one hand Gravity Hugo Life of Pi. Most 3-D exists to bilk customers out of a few extra bucks. But as it was conceived back in the mid-20th century 3-D was all about kitschy spectacle about giving an audience a cheap thrill by making them duck involuntarily in their seats. In that context Andersons repeated hurling of flaming volcanic projectiles directly at the screen -- the dominant feature of the latter third of Pompeii -- is firmly in the lovably trashy spirit of the 50s drive-in. Pity that beyond those pyroclastic missiles Anderson seems to want us to see his film and its hackneyed romance -- basically Titanic with swords and sandals -- as a serious-minded historical epic. If there were a hint of a sense of play or humor in the filmmaking beyond a briefly amusing moment of comeuppance for a foppish slaveowner Pompeii might be a fun February diversion instead of a dull eye-rolling slog. Maybe its not all Andersons fault. The fact is that our expectations for this sort of thing have changed in recent years thanks not least to Game of Thrones. While HBOs popular series is technically a fantasy and not set in our world it doesnt look so different in many respects from Europe in the first century A.D. The show sets a high bar for depictions of romance and political machinations in an ancient world as well as for pure visual grandeur. Its a bar so far above the reach of the video-gamey digital backdrops of Pompeii that it might as well be on top of Vesuvius. Any hopes of dodging Game of Thrones comparisons are dashed by the casting of Kit Harington -- Thrones Jon Snow -- as Milo a prodigiously skilled Celtic gladiator with a long-simmering vendetta against Rome. While Game of Thrones mostly effectively employs Haringtons knack for brow-furrowed brooding Pompeii looks to use his full range that brooding and his well-chiseled torso. (""Didnt you see his muscles?"" asks one character excitedly early in the film. Yes. Yes we did.) As the fates and the screenwriters would have it Milo arrives in Pompeii at the same time that Cassia (Emily Browning) the daughter of the local governor is returning from a year in the imperial capital. After a standard rom-com meet cute in which they find starry-eyed love over the corpse of a dead horse on the highway she goes to her opulent villa to be petulant with her parents while he heads to the dungeons below the Pompeiian coliseum where hell forge an unlikely friendship with a fellow gladiator (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Also arriving at the same time - fortuitous coincidence -- is the Roman Senator Corvis (Kiefer Sutherland) who 17 years earlier slaughtered Milos entire village and left our hero for dead. Its a good thing this is history as it would otherwise be pretty tough to believe that the cards would be set up with such unlikely perfection for Milo to find love friendship and vengeance all in one crazy Vulcanalia-festival weekend. If I sound flippant its only because Pompeii invites so many unintended laughs from the puppy-eyed romance of Milo and Cassia (which makes Twilight look like Casablanca) to the ridiculously implausible final chase which is essentially Fast amp; Furious on horseback. The lengths they go to in order to salvage a PG-13 rating -- multiple slit throats result in almost no blood at all -- make the whole thing seem like a pantomimed rehearsal. Meanwhile the movies final image which I wont spoil here caused an eruption of laughter at my screening that was louder than any response to most straight comedies. The only person in the entire cast who seems remotely aware of the ridiculousness of the whole thing is Sutherland who chews scenery like a starving man handed a turkey leg. He certainly had more laughs making it than anyone will watching it; if only hed let the rest of the cast and crew in on the joke.

When the combat grows tedious director Paul W.S. Anderson switches focus to the erupting mountain which offers some impressive pyrotechnics.The cascading fiery eruption over Italys Bay of Naples and the surrounding countryside is also forced to take a back seat to a warmed-over love story. Pompeii is a Titanic wannabe with a romance between a rich girl and a poor boy set against a natural disaster. Besides Gladiator and Titanic the film borrows from 300Troy Spartacus Clash of the Titans and even The Princess Bride. The result is a generic saga with a cast of forgettable one-dimensional characters.STORY Kit Harington leads Thrones film assault in PompeiiMORE Mount Vesuvius is set to explode as star of PompeiiREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersToo much time is spent in Pompeiis massive arena with crowds cheering the carnage. But when disaster strikes in 79 A.D. scenes of thousands running for their lives engulfed in flames or crushed by crumbling buildings have a numbing computer-generated sameness. Making matters worse their ear-splitting screams are matched by the deafening crescendo of the overbearing musical score. Not a moment of subtlety sneaked its way into this production.While the lava flows the smoke billows and ashes fall like confetti the 3-D technology involved is unnecessary and doesnt make the experience a jot more immersive.Milo (Kit Harington) known as ""the Celt"" witnessed the massacre of his family as a child was enslaved and grew up to become an angry fighting machine. His talents are put to use by the Romans in gladiator clashes. But Milo is immediately gentled when he meets a wide-eyed Pompeii princess named Cassia (Emily Browning). He in turn charms her with his horse whispering talents.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare With echoes of Gladiator and Troy Pompeii looks like another epic period piece this time culminating with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. VPCTransformed into a chivalrous sort Milo braves lapping flames and falling buildings to save her. (But his courtliness has its limits He does nothing to protect her imperiled maid.) Nothing about their romance rings true not even the corny final shot in which theyre depicted as a body mold of kissing lovers preserved by ash forever.Several villains populate the film spewing malicious orders as they chew the scenery. When ordering the shackled slaves around they alternately refer to them as ""scum"" ""savages"" and ""barbarians."" Nastiest of all is the bloodthirsty Roman senator Corvus played by a snarling Kiefer Sutherland with an on-again off-again English accent.Milo forms a solid friendship with fellow slave Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) a massive fighter who threatens to steal the movie from his bland buddy.The dialogue is stilted and sometimes unintentionally laughable ""You dragged me from a perfectly good brothel for this"" sneers an arrogant slave trader as he watches gladiator combat he deems insufficiently brutal.A movie that focused solely on lava showers would quickly grow tepid. But how did it take a team of writers to come up with a bland story cobbled together from previous historical epics?When not focused on Vesuvius Pompeii is dull sword-and-sandal campy theatrics. 71 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1bqHtWq",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/02/20/pompeii-review/4989857/,200,pompeii13,pompeii,usatoday

Credit George Kraychyk/TriStar Pictures In Paul W. S. Andersons last three movies a swashbuckler and two films based on the ""Resident Evil"" video game he trained his camera on his wife Milla Jovovich in the obsessive way Josef von Sternberg once filmed Marlene Dietrich. In ""Pompeii"" Mr. Andersons latest 3-D extravaganza and his first film without Ms. Jovovich since 2008 he seems to be without visual focus.In this gladiator disaster film Romans massacre a Celtic horse tribe. The lone survivor Milo (Kit Harington left) becomes a slave whose horse-whisperer talents attract the attention of a young aristocrat Cassia (Emily Browning).Though the films gorgeous color palette resembles burnished jewelry there is a staleness and overfamiliarity to these early scenes. The film is not even enlivened by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Waves crash and cliffs collapse but we know exactly how this ends. Eventually as Milo tries to save Cassia from the CGI lava the film becomes a dripping bombastic romance with ash scattered like confetti.But Mr. Anderson displays his mastery as a director in the sword-fighting scenes. The camera glides and tilts in exact counterpoint to the thrusts of the knives as if a bloody ballet. These scenes recall the elegance and deftness of great car chases from films like ""Bullitt"" (1968). But the glares and eye rolls that bookend these scenes are what make this film both GIF-ready and campy fun.""Pompeii"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for intense battle sequences glistening torsos and swirls of blood and water.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Slave-turned-gladiator Milo (Kit Harington) has eyes for Cassia (Emily Browning) a powerful politicians daughter in ""Pompeii."" (Caitlin Cronenberg) By Stephanie Merry February 20 2014 Follow stephmerry ""Pompeii"" has a killer ending. Billowing clouds of ash swallow the ancient Roman town and fireballs rain down from above; whole city blocks slide into the sea and a tsunami tears through the streets leveling everything in its path. When Mount Vesuvius erupts -- feel free to direct spoiler complaints to Pliny the Younger -- the movie is completely absorbing. You just have to sit through more than an hour of derivative plot and tired dialogue to get there. The similarities between ""Gladiator"" and ""Pompeii"" are hard to overstate. In both cases you have a warrior whos enslaved after his family is murdered. In both cases he turns out to have an exceptional talent for killing people he befriends an African gladiator and he falls in love with a woman leagues above his social standing. But only in ""Pompeii"" does the protagonist talk to horses. Milo (Kit Harington from ""Game of Thrones"") is the last member of a Celtic tribe of equestrians who are massacred by Roman soldiers led by Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) and his right-hand man Proculus (Sasha Roiz). Milo manages to escape his parents fate at age 6 but hes scooped up and enslaved and years later becomes a killing machine who can enter an arena unarmed and take out three sword-wielding opponents. Milo could be a star if he werent stuck in provincial Londinium. And so hes sent to Pompeii. Along the way he meets Cassia (Emily Browning) the daughter of a powerful politician and notices that the two people hed most like to kill -- Corvus and Proculus -- also happen to be in town. To make matters worse Corvus has his eye on Cassia. Most of the movie is taken up by scene after scene of gladiatorial games but when Milo isnt fighting hes sharing passionate looks with Cassia and steely glares with Corvus. None of this really matters once the ground begins to shake and Vesuvius wakes from its slumber. Then the movie transitions from a ""Gladiator"" clone to a less successful Roland Emmerich catastrophe pic. Say what you will about the man behind ""White House Down"" and ""Independence Day"" but the character developments in those movies look pretty good compared with the scant dialogue and simplistic personalities in Milos world. That being said ""Pompeii"" does Emmerich one better in the special effects department. Paul W.S. Anderson best known for the ""Resident Evil"" franchise and 2011s ""The Three Musketeers"" creates harrowing simulations of the disaster. Its enough to make you want him to ditch the story altogether because as soon as were back on the ground with Corvus in a chariot chased by Milo some of the images are so clearly computer-generated that the drama drains right out of the moment. Haringtons star is on the rise. Hell star opposite Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore in the upcoming film ""The Seventh Son"" and hes signed on for the movie adaptation of the popular British television series ""Spooks."" Yet his first starring role doesnt showcase what he can do from an acting standpoint. Harington transformed his body for the role but heres the real disaster His startlingly defined six-pack abs are the most memorable part of his character.  1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense battle sequences disaster-related action and brief sexual content. 105 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"Review Pompeii works to explosive effect - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Pompeii works to explosive effect Pompeii Caitlin Cronenberg / Film District Kit Harington as Milo and Emily Browning as Cassia in ""Pompeii."" Kit Harington as Milo and Emily Browning as Cassia in ""Pompeii."" (Caitlin Cronenberg / Film District) Gary Goldstein Part sword-and-sandal spectacle part disaster epic ""Pompeii"" accomplishes its ambitious agenda to largely engrossing effect. Sure its not the brainiest of outings but director Paul W.S. Anderson (the man behind four of the ""Resident Evil"" films) keeps the action apace and the lava a-flowing with workmanlike energy and sufficient visual dazzle.Set in AD 79 immediately before and during the cataclysmic eruption of southern Italys Mt. Vesuvius the script by Janet Scott Batchler amp; Lee Batchler and Michael Robert Johnson places a star-crossed romance at the center of one of the ancient worlds most legendary calamities. And though a ""Titanic""-like fate may await the storys would-be lovers -- enslaved gladiator Milo (Kit Harington of ""Game of Thrones"") and young noblewoman Cassia (Emily Browning) -- their forbidden pairing gives this often brutal picture a necessary bit of heart. The first half of the film finds the heroic Milo and his fellow slave fighters including reigning champion Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) descending upon the then-coastal resort city of Pompeii (convincingly re-created at a Toronto studio) for some big-time arena battles.BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | Olsen Meanwhile ruthless Roman senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) arrives to flex some political muscle as well as ensnare Cassia in marriage. (Theres a vaguely creepy back story between them; theres also bad history between Corvus and Milo.) Cassias wealthy parents (Jared Harris Carrie-Anne Moss) will also prove pawns in Corvus dastardly plans.But things really explode after ominous volcanic rumblings turn into Vesuvius colossal detonation which notoriously annihilated a city and its people though much was weirdly preserved by molten rock and ash. The massive CGI-enhanced destruction augmented by the effects of an attendant earthquake and tsunami is tense eye-popping and occasionally riveting. The 3-D here though not essential is put to decent use during the movies many hellish moments.Although the cast especially the pumped-up Harington and the lovely Browning is at best serviceable and the dialogue frequently too basic ""Pompeii"" succeeds as escapist entertainment.---------------- ""Pompeii""MPAA rating PG-13 for intense battle sequences disaster-related action and brief sexual content.Running time 1 hour 45 minutes.Playing In general release.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com POMPEII Share Comment You wonder if Paul W.S. Anderson is a director who might feel disrespected. Like the Jack Arnold schools most determined student Anderson can lend surprising legitimacy to a franchise-milking gimmick like ""Alien vs. Predator"" or a videogame tie-in like ""Resident Evil."" For his trouble though he often seems to get the business from fanboys and critics alike. He gets the chance to make his next B movie and thats about it. Heck he even had to tack on the ""W.S."" a few movies into his career because Paul Thomas Anderson commandeered the name with you know respectable films like ""Magnolia."" Now comes ""Pompeii"" Andersons stab at rendering the Mount Vesuvius catastrophe with a 3-D ""Titanic"" gloss. And you wonder some more Is this simply the latest project to grab his interest or a calculated bid to help him break out in a way he never has? Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

"Review Pompeii 1.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Review Pompeii 1.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Top sword-and-sandal films By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Feb 20 2014 1212 PM Theres only one reason to see a movie like ""Pompeii."" Its why the film is in 3-D after all -- not so the tongues pop when the two leads finally kiss in grating slow motion but so the raining hellfire of a blown volcano looks prettier on its descent to incinerate a city. Add to that a main character who spends all his time in the lead-up to the big moment engaged in gladiatorial fights and theres really only one appeal for a sword-and-sandals disaster flick based on one of the most catastrophic volcanic eruptions in history Youre there for the carnage. But you wont find it in ""Pompeii"" one of the most bloodless films to ever kill thousands of people in a fell swoop. Bodies fall by the dozens in coliseums cut down by blades with nary a 3-D blood spatter; bodies disappear or turn instantly to ash in waves of flame. The flick had to nab that all-important PG-13 rating after all but it does so at the expense of the one possible draw the film might have. Whats more a good disaster flick knows to build the stakes to give the audience someone to care about in the face of certain doom. ""Pompeii"" has about an hour or so to do that before Vesuvius blows its top but it fails to offer as single compelling character as a sacrifice to the angry volcano. For a main character you have Milo aka the Celt (Kit Harington) who as a boy watched as his people were slaughtered by the Romans. Now hes a warrior slave a gladiator made to kill for the entertainment of his Roman masters. He glowers and delivers a handful of taciturn monosyllabic lines powered by his rippling abs. He likes horses. He catches the eye of Cassia (Emily Browning) a daughter of means whose family is trying to impress the Roman senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) so that he might invest money in Pompeiis development. Instead of building a meaningful romance between the mismatched pair the film treads water with what it considers political intrigue. As a result we spend more time with the anachronistic Sutherland and his unidentifiable accent than we do with the protagonist and his six pack. Which would be fine if theyd cast a veteran actor who can ham up a terrible-villain role for a paycheck but Sutherland looks like hes having even less fun than the audience inevitably will. By the time the volcano erupts Milo and Cassia have spent maybe a collective 10 minutes together in their entire lives most of which was spent talking about horses and thats expected to be enough to justify Milos mad dash across a quickly incinerating city to save his lady love. Nobody expects director Paul W.S. Anderson to be Orson Welles. With a wealth of schlock-horror and action films to his credit (more ""Resident Evil"" movies than you can shake a stick at a risible take on ""The Three Musketeers"") ""minimally entertaining"" is as good as winning an Oscar. But even with such low expectations this is a mess of a movie the action muddied and darkened by 3-D the spectacle hamstrung by the PG-13 rating. The result is a film that doesnt appeal to anyone -- not the romantics not the historians not even action fans who just want a decent sword fight.

"Pompeii a blast once it finally erupts review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPompeii a blast once it finally erupts reviewThe drama is deadly but the volcano soars making Pompeii something less than the complete disaster you might expect. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 20 2014PompeiiStarring Kit Harington Emily Browning Kiefer Sutherland Jared Harris Carrie-Anne Moss and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. 104 minutes. Opens Feb. 21 at major theatres. PGThe drama is deadly but the volcanos a blast making Pompeii something less than the complete disaster you might expect.Of course Paul W.S. Anderson really wanted to make this movie. As a commercial director of infinite zeal for all things derivative loud and messy he would take to illustrating the big Roman bang of AD 79 like a zombie duck to a pool of blood.Article Continued BelowIt must have pained him even to tarry with the films minimal dramatic foreplay before the CGI eruption a story of heroic slavery filched from innumerable sword-and-sandal movies from Spartacus through Gladiator. Actors can be such a nuisance when all you really want to do is light the fuse on a stack of dynamite.Yet it must be said that Pompeii doesnt completely suck although it does blow metaphorically speaking. When the time comes for Mt. Vesuvius to unleash its historical fury Anderson and his ace Toronto tech team (the movie was made here) really go with the flow.The mayhem of the ancient city being whacked by Mother Nature (or by vengeful gods) is convincingly rendered in the films second half with much fire and brimstone being tossed about. Particularly effective is a scene where an unmoored ship roars down the main drag dragged there by a tsunami caused by the attendant earthquake.The 3D isnt half bad especially if you see it on an IMAX screen.Anderson has learned a few things about movie mechanics in his long years spent enlivening zombies (the Resident Evil franchise) speed demons (the Death Race franchise) space creatures (Event Horizon AVP Alien vs. Predator) and other multiplex distractions.But theres that first half of Pompeii to get through first.Its written by a committee that includes the guilty parties behind the nonsense of Sherlock Holmes and Batman Forever. And its a slog even as it rips through a prologue that sets up our oppressed hero Milo (Kit Harington from TVs Game of Thrones) as a life-long enemy of the smirking Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) a genocidal warrior who later becomes a Roman senator.Sutherland seems to be the only one really enjoying himself here. He gets to unleash his inner fascist and say things like ""Let the games begin"" as the heads start to roll.Milo doesnt have much to say for himself but he doesnt have to. His gladiatorial skills are top-notch and hes duly tagged for active duty in the Pompeii arena. En route to the blood sports he demonstrates his other talent as a horse whisperer prompting love-at-first-sight heart thumps within the bosom of Cassia (Emily Browning) the daughter of town leader Severus (Jared Harris of TVs Mad Men) and his wife Aurelia (Carrie-Anne Moss).Milo feels the love although he seems closer to his prison pal Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje of TVs Lost). Maybe Milo is just distracted by the constant earth-shaking and mountain-quaking that only he seems to notice.Harington and Browning make for odd casting choices. Hes no Kirk Douglas or Russell Crowe to say the least. And shes best known for playing characters in a dream state in Sucker Punch and Sleeping Beauty.The two go together like ice upon ice rather than fire upon fire.So Pompeii is hardly a love story for the ages but -- forgive me -- at least we get to watch a lot of people make an ash of themselves.Blow Vesuvius blowThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Running time 106 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence sexuality). At the E-Walk Battery Park City others. Excellent special effects and solid exciting sequences carry the day as Mount Vesuvius and howlers erupt in ""Pompeii a campy guilty pleasure that serves up a ""Gladiator knockoff as an appetizer to the impressively flame-filled main course. Kit Harington of HBOs ""Game of Thrones may lack the gravitas of Russell Crowe but sports newly acquired six-pack abs as Milo a slave/gladiator whose parents are slaughtered in ""the rebellion of the Celtic horse tribes in ""Britannia A.D. 62. Seventeen years later on the way to Pompeii Milo impresses the beautiful young aristocrat Cassia (Emily Browning of the unfortunate ""Sucker Punch) with his skills as a horse whisperer. Unfortunately Cassia is being pursued as a wife by dastardly Roman senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland trying to outdo his dad Donalds villainy in ""The Hunger Games) who was responsible for the death of Milos parents. Corvus idea of courtship is to promise Cassia that ""I will break your will. Another acting scion Jared Harris of ""Mad Men (whose late dad Richard played the murdered emperor in ""Gladiator) turns up to exclaim things like ""By Junos tit Hes Cassias businessman father who needs Corvus financial backing to replace Pompeiis crumbling (little does he know) century-old stadium. The gladiator battles that serve as the warm-up for the apocalypse are effectively staged by the team responsible for ""300 even if the fighters entrance into the arena makes them look a bit like the chorus line in a Broadway musical. The acting is better than serviceable with standout work by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje outdoing Djimon Hounsou in ""Gladiator as a fierce black gladiator who is happy to lay down his life for our white hero in the end (Cassia has a female slave who performs a similar function in a collapsing villa). All hell breaks loose at about the one-hour mark and its clear that most of the reported 100 million budget went for special effects including an elaborately handsome re-creation of Pompeii thats spectacularly laid to waste in ways that would shame even Hollywood master of disaster Roland Emmerich. Accompanied by a throbbing Clinton Shorter score ""Pompeii doesnt miss a cliche of the genre except maybe for toppling giant statues. Volcanic ash flaming bursts of lava a tsunami that pushes boats through the streets -- it all works remarkably well except for a phony-looking climactic chariot race. Without giving anything away this German-Canadian co-production directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (the endless ""Resident Evil franchise) has a modern-day coda that got more laughs at the preview I attended than any comedy this year.

The first sixty minutes of ""Pompeii"" are awful bordering on unwatchable. A dreary cliche-a-minute love story about a gladiator with a heart of gold (he loves horses) the moony pale (really pale considering her Mediterranean address) Princess who falls for him and the big powerful meanie who obstructs their noble coupling. Oh my sweet Jove it is boring. The final forty-five minutes of the movie however are by sheer force of will irrefutably entertaining. At least theres raining death in the form of fireballs smashing up the place. There is of course the inherent paradox that to enjoy ""Pompeii"" you need a big screen environment. Paul W.S. Anderson is one of the few directors that shoots in native 3D and knows how to craft a striking image. This means that to take full advantage you will not be at liberty to make snide comments and actively mock the creaky dialogue and wooden performances unless you are one of those jerks who talks at the movies. Kit Harrington plays ""The Celt"" and it is really bad casting. Its impossible not to think about ""Game of Thrones"" and Jon Snow and during the lumbering first hour youll be sitting there saying ""Man do I wish I were watching Game of Thrones and not this bag of garbage."" All of that shows nuance intricate storytelling and envelope-pushing style is nowhere to be found. The valiant gladiator versus the sadistic Roman still kinda plays when you are catching an old movie on TCM on a Sunday afternoon. But its 2014 and ""Pompeii""s level of depth-free characterization with absolutely no creative spin is absolutely unacceptable. The Celt and his fellow gladiator buddy Atticus (Adewale Akkinnuoye-Agbaje who at least has some presence) train and talk smack and when the day of the big fight comes - a recreation of the mentally scarring slaughter of The Celts youth - thats when the looming volcano finally goes boom. Like the Irwin Allen shlock films of the 1970s such as ""Earthquake"" or ""The Towering Inferno"" or my favorite ""The Swarm"" ""Pompeii"" is basically a whole lot of sitting around waiting for the THING that got you into the theater to happen. Finally it happens and then you get to see a whole lot of people run around and scream and die in in this films case computer generated ways. Kiefer Sutherland bless him is the only one who seems to understand that this movie is meant to be a good time. I cant quite put my finger on what kind of accent hes doing - is mouth full of soggy bread a region? - but at least it makes for some chuckles. He leers and lusts for The Celts gal pal (Emily Browning.) Shes the daughter of the town muckity muck Jared Harris whose job is to have an English accent and Carrie-Anne Moss whose job is to make you say ""THATs Carrie-Anne Moss??"" Paul W.S. Andersons best movies ""Event Horizon"" and believe it or not the most recent ""Resident Evil"" work well when they just go for broke and let the insanity happen. Theres no such risk-taking in this snoozer. Yes there are a few gorgeous frames particularly of smoke trails over the city a Greek chorus in golden masks and The Celts traumatic memories but even Andersons dreadful ""Three Musketeers"" had a few good scenes. At its very best ""Pompeii"" can only offer you fragmented images. I love Hollywood-ized Roman crap and I love men fighting to the death in an amphitheater. But the filler in between the action has to at least keep the engine revved up. ""Pompeii"" alas is nothing history will remember.

Heres the last thing I ever would have expected out of Pompeii that sword-thrust of 3D gladiator-vs.-volcano madness coming right at your disbelieving eyeholes. An hour or so in when Vesuvius exhausts its portentous rumblings and blows its top (3D) I legitimately wasnt ready. Yes all that third-act destruction is Pompeiis reason for existing and probably your reason for bothering to read a Pompeii review and the eruption is certainly teased with great effort all throughout that lava-free first hour -- seriously director Paul W.S. Anderson cuts to the mountain as often as Peter Jackson does to the ring. Its as distracting as all the mentions of the weather toward the end of The Buddy Holly Story. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But when Vesuvius does kaboom it interrupts a perfectly spirited gladiator picture the likes of which Hollywood just doesnt make a rousing slaves-vs.-Romans close-combat thriller I was in no way ready to see chucked in favor of another CGI apocalypse. Kit Harington (Game of Thrones Jon Snow) stars as Celtic Warrior Whose Name I Forget an orphaned hunk with abs so sharply defined you could race Matchbox cars through the grooves between them. Hes hauled from a bloody-puddle London slave pit to battle in Pompeiis glittering arena which is the gladiator equivalent of Triple-A ball just one step down from Rome. En route his chain gang runs into the carriage of Pompeiian princess Cassia (Emily Browning) a beauty who like so many women in adventure movies has a hole in her life the exact size and shape of our sweaty hero. Her horse is spooked and wounded but Slave Hunk has taken the Equine Expertise +1 skill when leveling up so he knows just what to do snap the sad beasts neck.Is this the first case of horse murder as a meet-cute?Film Details Pompeii RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time98 More Info Trailer The romance is as fresh as the box of Arm amp; Hammer in the back of your fridge. Fortunately theres no time to dwell on it as Anderson is hustling the movie along to its key relationship the terrifically entertaining friendship struck up between Slave Hunk and Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) a champion pit-fighter our hero is slated to face in to-the-death combat. These two immediately hit it off each vowing to let the other die with honor -- and each still insisting he will be the victor. Sadly the script squanders this promising will-they-or-wont-they and after a brawling practice match the two wind up as buddies who mostly go their separate ways occasionally pitching in on each others battles. These two are so likable together that this is quite a disappointment. Its like if the Dirty Dancing couple decided not to bother with the lift and instead boogie on opposite sides of the Catskills.The destruction when it comes is fine. Anderson is an impressive crafter of pop-gothic images and each shot of cataclysmic nonsense flows smoothly into the next a feat once so fundamental to filmmaking that it still feels absurd to have to praise it. Hes also vulgarian enough to use the 3D for giddy thrills rather than that screen-expanding immersion favored by more blandly tasteful directors. His volcano pukes fireballs into the crowd which is exactly what a 3D volcano should do. Later when the Tyrrhenian Sea cascades into the streets Anderson stages grand tawdry computer-animated spectacle. Unlike most city-go-smash setpieces this is vibrant and surprising only occasionally rote the shots of screaming crowds and raining fire a skin over the heart and muscle of a story better told than many.And all that pales before the gladiatorial stuff. Andersons battles are crisp brutal and stirring and unlike Ridley Scott he doesnt try to shame us for wanting to see gladiators crack each others skulls. The choreography is about killing and blocking rather than heroic poses and Anderson distinguishes himself as the rare action director who shows us real bodies in real space in real reaction to each other who prizes legibility over quick-cut dazzlement who stages his fights with comic-book zeal rather than puffed-up graphic-novel miserableness. In the final minutes Anderson goes all in on the love story chucking in a for-the-ages romantic tragedy from nowhere and then daring to end on imagery so swooningly poetic it set my preview audience howling. Laughs are laughs though so why knock it? Andersons chutzpah with this finale is something akin to building a city in the shadow of a volcano; it wont be a surprise when critics cover his Pompeii in ash and fire. Since he labors on relatively downmarket features -- video game adaptations sword-and-sandal folderol like this -- hes an easy target for anyone who has pride invested in the belief that a dumb gladiator flick is less honorable a cinematic event than the latest self-important superhero origin story. If Pompeii came out in summer had an extra reel of kissing and was credited to anyone else the world would likely give it a qualified thumbs-up and move on. Oh Keifer Sutherland Carrie-Anne Moss and Jared Harris are all in here too. They get three one and two good moments respectively mostly in a sleepy half-hour about love and politics in the movies middle.

Photo Caitlin Cronenberg Sony Pictures Pompeii review The plot is in ruins 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Pompeii Action. Starring Kit Harington Kiefer Sutherland and Emily Browning. Directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. (PG-13. 105 minutes.) Pompeii disappeared under fire and lava in 79 A.D. but only movies can convey the devastation and only a modern movie can re-create the earthquakes the tidal waves the floods and the volcanic eruptions that turned Pompeii into the least favored piece of real estate on the planet. Here is a disaster just made for deluxe 3-D treatment and with a big finish already built in Kaboom The only challenge was to get the beginning and middle right and even that shouldnt have been too hard. Just create a handful of characters that the audience doesnt want to see get hit by a fireball. Remember ""San Francisco"" (1936) with Jeanette MacDonald and Clark Gable? The more you got to like those people the more you started to worry about the 1906 earthquake. But nothing like that happens in ""Pompeii."" On the contrary you start to root for Mount Vesuvius. In fact compared to the audience Vesuvius begins to seem really patient. The first indication of trouble comes in the movies first moments. Instead of being transported to Pompeii in 79 we go back to ancient Britannia in 62 where the Celtic Horse Tribes are in revolt. Its a very quick revolt. Basically the battle consists of a little boy walking outside his tent to witness Roman soldiers slaughtering his family. Its just a blighted landscape and people getting hacked to pieces the kind of thing you can see in every other movie. Fast forward 17 years later. The boy is now a strapping gladiator and still were not in Pompeii. But eventually his talent is recognized and he is sent to the almost-big town. (For gladiators Pompeii is to Rome apparently what Boston is to Broadway a good place for an out-of-town tryout.) Along the way young Milo (Kit Harington) has a few meaningful encounters with Cassia (Emily Browning) a big-eyed upper-class girl being courted by an evil Roman senator (Kiefer Sutherland). The out-of-towners Youll notice that theres nothing here about normal life in Pompeii a life that would be of interest if only because its about to get wiped off the map. All we get is a lot of stuff about out-of-towners - gladiator angst gladiator bonding love at first sight and Romans causing trouble. We do get glimpses of street life and we do get to see inside an upper-class Pompeiian house but a feeling for the community which might have been conveyed as a matter of course becomes impossible because the movie mainly concerns outsiders. This seems misplaced. Just imagine you had to make the definitive movie about the 9/11 attacks in downtown Manhattan. Would you build your story around a troupe of foreign performance artists who just happened to be visiting that day? Of course you wouldnt and yet even that analogy barely describes the missed opportunity here. We know Manhattan well enough that an alternative angle might conceivably work. But Pompeii is a fascinating mystery with enormous possibilities that the movie utterly ignores. Fun dialogue Still it must be fun writing ancient Roman dialogue e.g. ""Youve dragged me from a perfectly good brothel for this"" and ""These Thracians are too costly to feed."" Its certainly fun to hear it. And if you want to see disaster effects ""Pompeii"" is the ultimate in one-stop shopping a combination of the floods in ""The Impossible"" the earthquakes in ""2012"" and the fireballs of just about every action movie made since 1985. Plus there are volcanic eruptions not to mention volcanic ash raining down onto the seats in front of you - or seeming to in 3-D. As for the fact that theres no reason to care whom the fireballs hit or who gets covered in lava or whose house caves or whose ship blows up - well thats unfortunate. Although if you think of ""Pompeii"" as a ride a conveyance for special effects and not anything resembling an emotional experience indifference can almost be a good thing.

Area theaters. In 3D where available. Its impossible to find anything that grabs you in ""Pompeii."" This lumpen adventure with a misguided romance buries anything in the disaster-flick genre that might have been a blast. Worse director Paul W.S. Anderson -- talentless auteur of the ""Resident Evil"" films -- has molded this doomed-lovers-facing-catastrophe movie into a revamp of ""Titanic"" with the role of the ocean liner played by Mount Vesuvius. When the volcano isnt burbling ominously its looming like the shark in ""Jaws."" The hero is Milo (hirsute Kit Harington of ""Game of Thrones"") a Celtic slave boy who sees his mother slain by evil Roman Sen. Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland back in psycho mode). Kiefer Sutherland and Kit Harington clash in Pompeii. (George Kraychyk) As Milo reaches manhood in 79 A.D. his skills as a gladiator earn him a ticket out of rainy Britannia and into sunny Italy. Crowds in the provinces root for him under his nom de brute ""The Celt."" At least it sounds more threatening than ""Milo."" Winding up in Pompeii a Roman resort town Milo meets Cassia (Emily Browning) the moneyed daughter of a Roman businessman (Jared Harris with his right arm bent and stuck in his toga as if he were a statue). Earlier Milo and Cassia had a meet-cute when he cavalierly killed her stricken horse for her. Adewele Akinnouye-Agbaje and Kit Harington in Pompeii (Caitlin Cronenberg) Theres a rivalry-turned-friendship between Milo and another fighter (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). As the volcano rumbles (silly gladiators they think thats simply angry gods stomping around) Milo wrests Cassia from Corvus clutches. But then the lava deluge begins. Turns out its very hard to outrun those. The script is laughable smothered in sword-and-sandal silliness until fireballs hurtle toward Pompeii. The film essentially bides its time until its revealed who will turn into the hauntingly preserved figures glimpsed in the opening credits. Anderson doesnt seem to care that unlike his earlier movies inspired by video games this one is based on a real event. Still he makes things one-dimensional -- and in murky 3-D no less. Kiefer Sutherland in Pompeii (Courtesy of Sony Pictures Entert) No actor could come out of ""Pompeii"" alive. Sutherland scowls and pontificates then yowls about ""the glory of Rome"" As for the young lovers Harrington never even gets to a low boil and Browning (""Sucker Punch"") is directed to be about as animated as an art exhibit. A magma-covered Leo and Kate theyre not.

"Pompeii (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Pompeii (PG-13) This silly CGI-laden spectacle is a guilty pleasure. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com2/20/2014 Editor rating 2 Pompeii is half sword-and-sandal epic half disaster movie and all guilty pleasure. Director Paul W.S. Anderson taking a break from cranking out Resident Evil movies has a strong command of CGI technology and 3D effects and the movie is so grand in scale that you cant help surrender to the spectacle even if the stuff thats going on with the people in the film is often close to risible. In his first starring role since becoming famous as Jon Snow on Game of Thrones Kit Harington proves hes much better as an ensemble player than as a leading man. As Milo a slave-turned-gladiator who saw his family butchered before his eyes when he was young Harrington is supposed to brood and smolder and emanate inner turmoil but he comes across as a really quiet dude whos good with a sword. The first half of the movie is strongly reminiscent of Russell Crowes Gladiator as Milo and fellow slave-fighter Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) grow from mortal enemies into unlikely allies plotting to take down the sneering Roman senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland in a so-bad-its-good performance). Milo also makes cow eyes from the arena floor at the beautiful Cassia (Emily Browning) who shares his attraction but has already been promised by her parents to marry Corvus. Pompeii delves just enough into history to give you a sense of how politics worked in the era (Jared Harris plays a Pompeii entrepeneur who has great plans for the city) and the battle scenes are well-staged and exciting if noticeably bloodless (that PG-13 rating must be observed). Then that pesky Mount Vesuvius starts belching a tsunami plows into the region and an earthquake splits the ground all at the same time (talk about worst day ever). From here Pompeii becomes a Roland Emmerich picture perhaps a little more refined in sensibility and ambition but still silly enough to have characters running toward flowing lava. The dialogue is often pleasantly leaden (""Ive never seen you look at any man the way you looked at that slave"" one of Cassias friends says as she ogles the buff Milo) but the sound effects are way cool and the 3D is spectacular with glowing ashes that seem to float off the screen and onto your lap. Pompeii is nowhere near good but its quick and to the point and although obviously aimed at teens just fun enough to keep grown-ups entertained if not always in the ways the filmmakers intended.

This team-up between the director of ""AVP Alien vs. Predator"" (Paul W.S. Anderson) and the star of ""Sucker Punch"" (Emily Browning) is as awful as you feared it might be although theres at least some camp value in watching Kiefer Sutherland froth at the mouth as a very Billy Zane-like Roman bigwig. Watch video Game of Thrones Star Kit Harrington Fights Gladiators Volcanoes in New Pompeii Trailer (Video) This is after all ""Titanic"" with lava instead of ice a tale of two pretty young people from different castes who discover their perfect love just as their world is about to go to hell and even those who hated James Camerons hit romance will find themselves thinking more kindly of it after they watch Browning and Kit Harington moon over each other with one facial expression between them. Browning stars as Cassia who returns from Rome to Pompeii to see her parents Aurelia (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Severus (Jared Harris) not knowing that Severus is caught up in some sort of real-estate deal with the insidious Corvus (Sutherland). As it turns out Corvus had years earlier slain a village of horseback-riding warriors; the tribes sole survivor Milo was enslaved as a child and trained as a gladiator. The now grown-up Milo (Harington) has arrived in Pompeii where hes expected to battle Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); the latter gets stuck with a lot of leftover Danny Glover dialogue from the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise since Atticus will supposedly gain his freedom if he can win just one more battle which is the gladiator equivalent of being two days from retirement. And as they say in really bad novels Suddenly the volcano erupted. And admittedly as on-screen carnage goes the CG destruction of ""Pompeii"" is reasonably entertaining especially if you like watching groups of extras run around aimlessly in a panic while fake villas go up in a fireball. Also read Comic-Con 2013 Game of Thrones Kit Harington Joins How to Train Your Dragon 2 This is the sort of disposable epic that they churned out cheaply in Europe in the 1950s and then overdubbed badly for the U.S. market in the hopes of tearing people away from their television sets. Now that those sets are 96 inches and connected to Blu-ray players that have the same 4K resolution that theaters offer were getting this movie all over again in 3D no less. If only ""Pompeii"" had been entrusted to a more entertaining hack than Anderson; this is the guy after all who decided that ""The Three Musketeers"" really needed a blimp battle. The characters (from the script by Scott Batchler amp; Lee Batchler and Michael Robert Johnson) are paper-thin so wiping them out with a volcano seems like overkill to say the least. Also read Sucker Punch Star Emily Browning Joins Luke Grimes in The Shangri-La Suite (Exclusive) Of course volcanoes wound up being a challenge even to Irwin Allen whose theatrical career was done in by 1980s lava-spewing flop ""When Time Ran Out.""

TWITTER Director Paul W.S. Anderson (""Resident Evil"") tackles historys most infamous volcanic disaster in an action-romance starring Kit Harington (""Game of Thrones"") and Emily Browning (""Sucker Punch""). The lava flows by the ton as does the cheese in Pompeii a kitschy apocalyptic peplum whose visual epiphanies -- of which there are definitely a few -- cannot outdo a B- (or C- or D-) grade scenario that will have lots of eyes rolling by the time the big stack finally blows. Not that one would expect less from Resident Evil mastermind Paul W.S. Anderson who clearly seems to be getting off on the massive destruction that this 100 million effects extravaganza allows him to unleash onscreen. But with a central love story that feels contrived from the very first note the major pleasure here is seeing it all blown to smithereens as quickly as possible resulting in a movie that will have far less staying power than Pompeiis infamous ash-covered victims. With Sonys TriStar rolling out the film in the U.S. this Friday and facing little new competition the Germany-Canada co-production could make a fast killing in its first frame though it wont stick around for long. Pompeiis overall theatrical gross could outperform Andersons The Three Musketeers but probably wont reach Evil levels while steady ancillary returns are a given. VIDEO Pompeii Super Bowl Ad Hints of 300 During Volcanic Eruption Roman Polanski was originally slated to adapt novelist Robert Harris take on the ancient natural disaster which took place in 79 A.D. when Mount Vesuvius violently erupted spewing out enough lava and ash to decimate the nearby Roman city of Pompeii and kill off most of its population (estimated at around 15000). One can only imagine how the Polanski-Harris version would have fared up against this explosive but awfully generic offering from Anderson and writers Michael Robert Johnson (Sherlock Holmes) Janet Scott Batchler and Lee Batchler (the duo behind Batman Forever one of the worst Batman movies) who borrow lavishly from Gladiator Spartacus and even The Horse Whisperer to concoct a storyline thats merely an elaborate pretext for all the fire and brimstone. A flashback features a young Celtic boy watching his parents slaughtered at the hands of the ruthless Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) and his top soldier Proculus (Sasha Roiz). Seventeen years later that boy has grown up to become a strapping gladiator known as ""The Celt"" but named Milo (Game of Thrones Kit Harington sporting way too much hair gel for a Roman slave) and is soon shipped off to the southern city of Pompeii to serve as violent entertainment for the blood-hungry plebeians. On the way he makes a major impression on Cassia (Emily Browning) the waifish daughter of town chief Severus (Jared Harris Mad Men) and wife Aurelia (Carrie-Anne Moss) whos heading back home after spending a rather turbulent year in Rome which her parents make sound like some sort of decadent party school. Also arriving is Corvus now a senator for Emperor Titus and in charge of deciding whether the capital will invest in Pompeiis much-needed urban improvements. PHOTOS 25 of the Most Anticipated Foreign Films of 2014 With all the characters -- including a fellow slave fighter Atticus (Adewale Akkinnuoye-Agbaje) whom Milo befriends in gladiator prison -- converging on the coastal burb just as Vesuvius starts making its first rumbles its clear by the second reel where things are headed and the script never once deters from a routine plot that plays like its literally been written in stone. This especially holds true for the burgeoning romance between Milo and Cassia whom the former woos by taming or breaking the neck of a horse when hes not stripping down to show off his killer pecs and abs. Since the backstory plays out as mere filler one can only wait for the volcano to erupt but Anderson delays the big moment for at least an hour. Just beforehand he delivers one of his better set pieces with Milo and Atticus fending off an entire Roman battalion as the city cheers on at the local arena the two muscle-bound warriors cutting their way through many a throat in the most PG-13 way imaginable. Once Vesuvius blows its off to the races (well chariot races) with slaves and citizens alike dashing for the seas as megabombs of fire rock and lava tear the town to pieces leaving little hope for escape and wasting more marble than a Beverly Hills bathtub. These moments are clearly where Anderson thrives cutting between distant birds-eye views of the devastation below and action-packed snippets where DP Glen MacPherson and VFX supervisor Dennis Berardi shoot tons of smoke and ash right into our faces. PHOTOS Game of Thrones Most Gruesome Deaths As if that werent enough there are also several deadly sword fights horse chases and one killer tsunami that sends all the corpses and rubble back in the other direction. Its apocalypse overdose for sure but like most CG mass destructions sometimes beautiful to behold even if the pounding sound design (by Stephen Barden) and score (by Clinton Shorter 2 Guns) hardly give us space to sit back and admire the scenery. Unfortunately the love story soon comes back around to spoil all the fun and while Anderson excels in the films many moments of digital doom-and-gloom he cant deliver a single authentic emotion between the two star-crossed leads leaving us with a sooty aftertaste of having sat through one very loud rendition of Titanic in togas. Tech credits are top-notch with sets by production designer Paul Denham Austerberry doing a great job laying out Pompeiis elaborate urban plan. 3D is actually a plus here especially when the mayhem begins.

The Romans give you every reason to wish for their destruction in Paul W.S. Andersons ""Pompeii"" a campy concept-driven disaster pic that mistakes the eruption of Vesuvius for the biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah where an entire city is deemed expendable on mostly moral grounds. Taking a page from ""Titanic"" the film invents a rich-girl/poor-boy romance puts a powerful suitor in their way and then besets their star-crossed love story with CG lava showers rendered all the more spectacular in stereoscopic 3D. In short ""Pompeii"" is a blast at least by guilty-pleasure standards opening to massive worldwide potential in a relatively uncompetitive February frame. ""Youve dragged me from a perfectly good brothel for this?"" asks an indignant slave trader evidently displeased that the carnage on offer at the local gladiator arena isnt of a higher caliber. An hour or so later the same guy finds himself staring down a flaming boulder his appetite for destruction more than satisfied by the Fates. While hardly high art (and without so much as a fossil record of the aborted project once slated for helmer Roman Polanski and scribe Robert Towne) ""Pompeii"" certainly recognizes what mass audiences want from a ""Game of Thrones""-style sword-and-scandal saga delivering especially high marks as either a sudsy indulgence for teenage girls or a beefcake offering for gay men. The pic even goes so far as to repurpose a ""Thrones"" star Kit Harington as its bestubbled slave hero Milo known to the Empire as ""the Celt"" -- one of the few survivors of a quashed rebellion. As a boy Milo watched his mother and the rest of their horse-loving tribe butchered by blood-thirsty future senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland relishing the chance to follow in his fathers footsteps by playing corrupt plutocrats). Now a lowly slave with abs of steel Milo has been transformed from gentle equestrian into deadly gladiator with only a small facial scar to show for the years of abuse. Talent-scouted in a grubby Londinium arena Milo is chained up and packed off to Pompeii impressing an upper-class beauty named Cassia (Emily Browning) along the way. The sensitive brute stirs passionate feelings in the young lady suggesting forbidden possibilities for the daughter of a Pompeii businessman (Jared Harris) and his proud wife (Carrie-Anne Moss) who have all but promised Cassias hand to the repulsive Corvus. Milo arrives in Pompeii on the eve of the Vinalia festival tossed in with other gladiators whom hell be expected to fight the following day. The local champion is a massive black slave named Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje who nearly steals the movie out from under its pretty-boy star) one last deathmatch away from earning his freedom -- an irony not lost on the mountain which glows fiery red in advance of the imminent eruption. Whenever things seem to drag at the story level Anderson cuts away to the volcano as if to remind us its only a matter of time before the helmer plans to obliterate everything he and screenwriters Janet Scott Batchler and Lee Batchler (""Batman Forever"") and Michael Robert Johnson have worked so carefully to construct. Essentially apart from Milo Cassia and Atticus -- as well as the young ladys beloved horse -- everyone in Pompeii is expendable condemned by either avarice or their insatiable desire to see loincloth-clad men dismember each other for sport (in which case the filmmakers may as well wish volcanic vengeance on their audiences as well). And so as the digital mountain begins to belch ash and massive cracks splinter their way through town the pic shifts its focus from survival to melodrama Milo must avenge his family Atticus must earn his freedom and Cassia cant possibly marry Corvus. Audiences of a certain age may recognize a superficial similarity between these generic agendas and those of ""The Princess Bride"" (which improved upon its B-movie ingredients through sheer force of screenwriting). One craves something as memorable as Inigo Montoyas ""prepare to die"" monologue the moment big chunks of the mountain start to rain down from the seemingly puritanical heavens conveniently missing any who still have unfinished business to attend to. Naturally the spectacle should be enough to fill the seats despite d.p. Glen MacPhersons tendency to shoot everything through a lens darkly -- even before clouds of black smoke blot out the sun. To ground us emotionally the filmmakers have resorted to the potboiler playbook risking unintentional laughter as Milo breaks free of his chains and runs toward the volcano in order to rescue his beloved the foolhardy gesture elevated to epic status by a stirring score from ""District 9s"" Clinton Shorter. Led by Mr. X the half dozen or so vfx shops that worked on ""Pompeii"" do a stunning job of re-creating the multi-pronged calamity -- which combines earthquakes eruptions and a tidal wave just slow enough for Atticus to rescue a child who has stumbled in its path. While more coherent than much of Andersons recent work the film proves less successful at combining destruction and damsel-in-distress storytelling within the same frame serving up blurry images of Milo trying to rescue Cassia while the city crumbles around them. As history it is even shakier compressing the 18-hour catastrophe into a series of cliffhangers and sword fights. Though modern-day framing devices rarely do more than make the films run longer the corny last scene begs some sort of comment from almost two millennia later. Archaeologists have spent decades trying to extrapolate what they can from the excavated skeletons of the 2000 or so victims who died in Pompeii as plaster casts reveal people frozen in positions of terror. Milo and Cassia defy the gods wrath striking a final pose so shamelessly romantic even Rodin couldnt top it. Film Review PompeiiReviewed at Cine Cite Les Halles Paris Feb. 19 2014. MPAA Rating PG-13.

For those of you who expect historical accuracy from a movie I suggest resourcing factual books and research as a source of enlightenment; and even then you have to be careful and discerning on what your read.. certainly not Wikipedia and certainly not what amounts to an action flick. Talk about high expectations. Reply Louw says March 4 2014 at 1253 pm After more than 10 years of studying and researching roman politics culture AND the disaster of vesuvius for the novel ""Havens of Pompeii"" I found this movie terribly disappointing on the facts on how Roman society worked and especially the over over over-dramatized eruption. Very disappointing. Reply Toonces Feline says February 26 2014 at 622 pm The architectural and geographic accuracy make the film worth watching. Its a family-friendly disaster film along the lines of 2012 but with more historical architectural and educational value. The love story while predictable is essentially the same story as that in the universally-lauded ""Titanic."" The battle scenes were highly enjoyable. I think the film has gotten a bad rap by critics since it is actually beautifully filmed and easy to watch from beginning to end. Two things I really liked about the screenplay were 1) the elegant opening and closing sequences showing the haunting ""cast sculptures"" of actual victims of Pompeii - visually explaining that these ""stone characters"" were real people with real emotions and lives; and 2) the storys skill at making us us empathize with the primary characters and care about them yet not be unduly sad or disappointed with their ultimate demise. After all everyone knew before entering the theater that Vesuvius had buried Pompeii and killed virtually all her citizens. Nonetheless the story was able to hold our attention until the very end. Reply Peter Debruge says February 26 2014 at 805 pm Well said. Reply Deni says February 23 2014 at 1204 pm In all seriousness who needed a spoiler alert for this film? If you have anything beyond a third grade education you have heard what happened correct? This movie was horrible. As a straight woman even I need more than shirtless boys who think they are real men. The acting was horrible the CGI effects were too much and those are the nicest things I can say about it. Oh and a tween girl made me take her to see it so stop yelling at the author. All he said was the truth. It is a crappy movie that seems to be made by Jack MacFarland. Reply Louw says March 4 2014 at 1259 pm agreed If it could just have been more factual - the eruption especially Fighting games on the day of the eruption? Seriously? On the day there was political votes taking place. NO games And thats just ONE fact out of a hundred more I can give https//www.facebook.com/pages/Pompeii-the-Novel/438336219566804?ref=hl Reply Loco says February 21 2014 at 739 pm Im really surprised people are taking offense to his remark about what the movie offers to gay men and teenage girls. I just watched it and honestly there was a lot more shirtless man than I expected. Some few scenes it seemed entirely unnecessary. The main character was a 1D attractive gladiator whos only purpose was to be eye candy. The romance was unrealistic for me and given the lack of character growth for everyone except Atticus and the father the movie offers violence destruction romance on the level of twilight and lots of hot male bodies. Reply Tracey says February 20 2014 at 639 am Wow Spoilers galore Does this guy always tell the entire movie in his reviews? This movie is an eye roller but boy is it a fun one. Go see if it you are just a lover of fight scenes unexplainable romance kickass sidekicks and the bad guy getting his. Am I the only one who was thinking that the ""teenage girls and gay men"" line is beccause they would love this movie because the lead is hot and there are a lot of other hot guys sprinkled throughout it? Not so much eye candy for those who like the ladies but lots for those who like men. Reply SS says February 20 2014 at 633 am You seem pretty comfortable with homophobia and misogyny Mr. Debruge. Well it just cost yourself a reader. Hope it was worth it Reply Peter Debruge says February 20 2014 at 851 am Sorry to hear it. Though speaking as a gay man the only homophobia I detect is whatever bias presumes that all film reviews are written by straight white guys. Meanwhile Im totally flummoxed by the accusations of misogyny. If they pertain to the prediction that teenage girls will like the movie well that demographic was the primary audience for TITANIC and this movie boasts many of the same pleasures (a tragic romance set against a massive historic cataclysm). For what its worth it wasnt the shirtless hunks I was referring to when predicting this films ideal audience (though they are undeniably a factor). Its pretty hard for anyone to take POMPEII seriously and yet the film is quite enjoyable as camp (granted not only gays get an ironic kick out of so-bad-its-good entertainment) and might even squeak by as frivolous romantic fluff. As for spoilers well you got me there. If you were going to POMPEII unaware of what happens to Vesuvius in August 79 A.D. boy are you going to be surprised Reply johntshea says February 20 2014 at 1135 am Slightly more seriously the assumptions that teenage girls and gay men are the main audience for POMPEII and that most movie reviews are written by straight white men are both generalizations of similar (i. e. negligible) value. But I consider neither homophobic. johntshea says February 20 2014 at 1125 am Vesuvius is a volcano? I never guessed Fred says February 20 2014 at 858 am I loved your comeback it was awesome and yes it totally surprised me that PomPeII fell into the sea. Ha I was as amused to learn the Titantic actually sunk too. Will wonders ever cease. Great review Peter Sandra Visser says February 20 2014 at 630 am So I guess Milo and Cassia dont make it out alive then. Thanks for the spoiler. Reply Mark says February 19 2014 at 934 pm ""teenage girls and gay men"" what an extremely homophobic thing to say. Reply pakman says March 12 2015 at 257 pm God Please find another word other than Homophobic to describe harmless comments already. At most that is just a poor choice of a pseudo-sexual reference made in a damn movie review; hardly a fear of homosexuality. An ""extreme"" example of a comment derived from homophobia would be something more like ""OMG they mentioned homosexuality in a movie kids may watch"" That is an absurd example of homophobia but far more relevant to any phobia than is ""teenage girls and gay men"". Get over yourself and quit speaking for the gay community Reply crookedmindframe says February 23 2014 at 614 pm How is that homophobic? People need to look up the definition of said words before using it... Reply Tracey says February 20 2014 at 640 am Why? Teenage girls and gay men dont love shirtless guys? Reply Francine York says February 19 2014 at 726 pm I can hardly wait - Usually I like what the review doesnt  Reply Yorick says February 19 2014 at 542 pm ""While hardly high art""... You know cause high art is for adult straight men. Little girls and gay men only like romance and shirtless men theyre so silly  Proving once again if need be that homophobia and sexism are two sides from the same coin. Reply cadavra says February 19 2014 at 309 pm ""As a boy Milo watched his mother and the rest of their horse-loving tribe butchered by blood-thirsty future senator Corvus"" Wow havent seen that bit since the original CONAN THE BARBARIAN Reply dormont says February 19 2014 at 138 pm Great Im about to take my 14 year old daughter....everyone will know what she is Reply johntshea says February 19 2014 at 122 pm Ill take Mr. Debruges word about gay men but it sounds like the beefcake will appeal to adult women too. And now Variety has got religion he should approve of the destruction of all those pagans. Reply Mjkbk says February 19 2014 at 118 pm ""......The Romans give you every reason to wish for their destruction.....where an entire city is deemed expendable on mostly moral grounds......"" And this is different from every movie ever made about Roman Pompeii HOW? Ive never seen one yet that didnt take EXACTLY this same ""Roman Empire Evil; Everything Else Not As Evil"" story tack...... Reply Ashlyn Rose says February 19 2014 at 1251 pm Peter your review had me howling. My interest perked up when I saw the cast who with the exception of Browning are excellent actors. However your comment that only teenage girls and gay men would see the film is offensive. Reply Michele Elyzabeth says February 19 2014 at 1213 pm Why is everything taken so seriously? In a society which glorifies ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"" all the ""Housewives of the world"" and Miley Cyrus twerking why cant you look at this as just pure entertainment? Few people around the world know anything about Pompeii so that in itself makes the experience a positive one. At least audiences will find out where it is on the map. Sutherland is great in this film. Moreover I truly wonder what Peter Debruge meant by ""While spectacle should be enough to fill the seats this campy 3D disaster saga caters especially well to teenage girls and gay men."" Is this some kind of generalization implying that all young girls and gay men are going to fall head over heels for the gladiators? This is so sexist and condescending... Not dignified of a true critic. Reply daycoder says February 19 2014 at 348 pm I honestly cant figure out any relevance to ""In a society which glorifies ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"" all the ""Housewives of the world"" and Miley Cyrus twerking"". Thats vacuous nonsense that should make us want more substance and better entertainment but Pompeii gives us neither. This is Showgirls bad. Its not that brain-off entertainment is a bad thing - I rather enjoyed Homefront for example - its that its impossible for the brain to ignore how awful this film is. I cant imagine anyone enjoying it regardless of age or sexual orientation. Reply MR says February 19 2014 at 1204 pm SPOILER I dont want to see it now that I know they dont make it Reply daycoder says February 19 2014 at 907 am This is a truly terrible film. Theres no Game-of-Thrones style to it at all. Thats an insult to a rare gem in the cessipit of television. Sutherland is at his worst. The fighting is so protracted that continued suspension of disbelief becomes impossible. SFX are not subtle. They seem geared toward making the most of 3D. Its 3D at its worst used only as a gimmick. The comparisons to Titanic and Princess Bride are apt. I really wanted to hear ""My name is Milo The Celt. You killed my father. Prepare to die"". Sadly it was not to be. The film is devoid of intentional humour but not so unintentional humour. The entire audience burst out laughing at the final pose. It wasnt so much shameless as utterly ridiculous. Milo isnt a Celtic name. There was a snort of derision from this Celt when he revealed his name. Reply JustTee says February 21 2014 at 1212 am Blah blah blah... Are you done throwing your little bossy fit? I have a some Midol with your name written all over it.
