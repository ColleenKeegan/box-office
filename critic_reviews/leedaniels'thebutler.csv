Facebook Twitter Print You Got Served The limits of pulp in The Butler and Kick-Ass 2. by Wesley Morris on August 15 2013 Just to be clear its actually not called The Butler. It couldnt simply be called that because the man who directed it also made Precious and that was actually Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire. But dont worry. What could have been The Butler A Movie Adapted From a Wil Haygood Washington Post Article That Was Only Partially About a Butler in the White House is actually just Lee Daniels The Butler. Its ludicrous -- the title I mean. This movie is a mini-monument to mini-monumentality like a tower of motel Bibles. Nonetheless with this much fake hair and real sweat with this much down-and-dirtiness and lack of seriousness passing itself off as high solemnity with this much indecency and entertainment and Dinah Washington and Soul Train with this perfect a balance between bad taste and best intentions who elses movie could The Butler be? Its true that Daniels isnt Spike Lee or Tyler Perry. Hes not a household name. But I dont think thats the point of turning The Butler into Lee Daniels The Butler. Its Lee Danielss movie because its not Stanley Kramers or Rob Reiners. It doesnt have the piety and starchiness and reverence Hollywood usually reserves for a movie that starts in a cotton field in 1926 and ends with Barack Obama in the White House. It doesnt have a white interloper to make the black experience palatable. It has Oprah Winfrey saying ""Get this low-class bitch outta my house"" Daniels has probably seen The Help. He knows we have and he understands that a great deal of its popularity comes from its desperation to sanitize the grimmer aspects of race and racism and the civil rights movement. Hes made a movie that is neither obeisant nor obsequious one that doesnt airbrush and defang history one that actually feels a little bit unsanitary. Its not an interpretation of actual history as much as it is a reduced revision of movie history. The film dichotomizes the civil rights era as a time of servitude and insurrection and puts all that strife at the door of a single black household. The story Wil Haygood wrote in 2008 was a short reported history of black people in the White House. The emotional hook was a butler named Eugene Allen whod served in eight administrations from 1952 to 1986. Haygoods piece was roving but it had a flinty historical recall. Obama hadnt yet entered the White House (the piece ran near Election Day) and the article used historical anecdotes to imply that Obamas odds were long. The benefit of hindsight permits the movie to be more sanguine about assorted presidents relationships to the service staff. Screenwriter Danny Strong first distills Haygoods piece down to the butlers perspective on his employers and pries it free from fact. Allen becomes Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) a family man mild in manner pleased to serve and devoted to his homemaker wife Gloria (Winfrey) and their two sons Louis and Charlie played by David Oyelowo and the very funny Elijah Kelley as adults. The tension between Cecil and Louis gives the film its trumped-up obvious politics. The boy looks at his father who wears a tuxedo at work six days a week and sees a man doing nothing to advance civil rights -- Cecil enters the White House during the Eisenhower administration and leaves during Reagans second term. Almost out of rebellion against his father Louis attends protests drops out of Fisk becomes a Freedom Rider then a righteous jailbird a member of the Black Panthers and finally an anti-apartheid activist. Cecil worries about and resents his sons truculence not because he doesnt sympathize necessarily but because he understands the danger of the fight; he can overhear presidents discussing the risks. What were dealing with here is a true trash artist and the craziest filmmaker in America right now. Yes this is the sort of movie in which a character happens to be present for every important historical conversation and revelation. Anytime a remark is made in the Oval Office about racial politics or civil rights theres Cecil coming or going or standing stock still with a silver tray. Ordinarily that trick would result in an iffy memoir. Or its Forrest Gump. Since Cecil performs the narration The Butler achieves the preposterousness of both. But theres something here thats impossible to dismiss as old-school TV-movie hokeyness -- or as a riff on the lessons wisdom and schematic episodic storytelling structure of say The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. (Of course the dreary old-age makeup which brings Whitaker and Winfrey too close to Troma Entertainment for comfort is a different story.) Daniels doesnt try to protect us from the mess of these four decades or the point-blank murder that opens the film in 1926. He doesnt romanticize the Gaines middle-class life. Its utterly earthbound. Gloria drinks and smokes but not abusively. Theres something adulterous going on with her good-looking no-good front-toothless neighbor (Terrence Howard) but the years (and the script and maybe even Winfreys vanity) straighten out the character morally so that her lapses dont seem entirely careless. The woman feels real. So do the men and women with whom Cecil works. Daniels likes murk and chaos and excess. He appreciates the stinky pull of luridness and the dark comedy that sometimes comes with it. And his rhythms have always been weird. Theres a sequence that crosscuts a semi-baroque White House banquet (brown hands slipping into white gloves; a grand choreographed entrance; a vague air of proud black hauteur) with Louis and the Fisk kids training in a basement as members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for their sit-in at a Woolworth counter. The kids white and black invade the whites-only section while the black butlers elaborately serve only whites. Daniels juxtaposes one highly civilized affair against another whose civility is ripped away. We see the students including Louiss future girlfriend Carol (Yaya Alafia formerly DaCosta) put through a practice wringer only to suffer the real thing at the hands of white racists their own age. The camera looks up from the counter and during the training up from the floor while at the White House it seems to float above the dinner table. Daniels jumps between the performative presentation of food in the government setting and its weaponization at the Woolworth -- kids being slapped squirted and doused with cream ketchup and coffee. Jumping among the three events -- the banquet the training the protest -- is overkill. But its a bizarrely powerful juxtaposition. That sequence is typical Daniels. He likes to overwhelm and dismay and provoke. The Butler is his fourth movie as a director. 2005s Shadowboxer (an erotic thriller with Cuba Gooding Jr. Helen Mirren Joseph Gordon-Levitt and MoNique) Precious and The Paperboy precede it. His production company also gave us the button-pushing sexuality and ethical provocations of both Monsters Ball and The Woodsman which featured Kevin Bacon as an ex-con pedophile. What unites them all to one extent or another is their obsession with luridness -- with sex and violence and violent sex with crime and sensation and pulp. Daniels wants us to feel something everywhere in our bodies except for our heads. Theres no thinking with him. He knows theres a visceral kick to a certain nasty form of movie-making and he isnt afraid to give it to us the tears guts and fried pigs feet; the breasts and erections; the primacy and inhumanity. The first good image we get of Jacqueline Kennedy in The Butler comes after her husbands assassination. While shes a wreck the camera pans up her leg to study the blood on her boucle. We dont even see her face in that scene. Its a rude shot. But for him its honest. Daniels is like Oliver Stone without the intellectual condom. What were dealing with here is a true trash artist and the craziest filmmaker in America right now. Precious and The Paperboy are vulgar triumphs. This might sound like faint praise but only in the churchiest sense as when you stand up before a preacher testify scream ""Hallelujah"" then pass the hell out. Daniels is free of that urge filmmakers of all races have to lift everybody up. For him blackness is beautiful but its also something to be overcome -- the pathologies self-doubts self-loathing. There is a way of being black thats abject and can leave you woebegone. That way of being black is called the blues and Daniels can be a thrillingly bluesy director. The Butler isnt perfect. The last 30 minutes or so arent even very good but the script needs to complete itself. Cecil has to meet Barack and so there are about four scenes -- with old Cecil and old Gloria -- that make you laugh and cringe at the same time. The chief problem with The Butler is that it cant keep still. Theres nothing for an audience to sink into and get lost in. The march from one administration to the next -- and from one dreadful casting choice to another -- starts to feel promiscuous from a dotty Eisenhower (Robin Williams) to a petite and dashing JFK (James Marsden) to a brash LBJ (Liev Schreiber) to a soppy Nixon (John Cusack) and a moony Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman). Cecil interacts with each president but hes written as a bystander for too much of the movie. Whitaker wears a short brown rug on his head and too much makeup (the movie is so far from Eugene Allens life that he really doesnt have to look like anyone specific so why not have him look like Forest Whitaker?) but the quick emotional flashes that are the key to Whitakers acting dont arrive. The performance is merely steady like two hours watching a pilot light. Even so Daniels remains such a confident director of actors that you have to wonder how much worse off Whitaker might have been without him. Winfrey has never been a natural actress. She had carriage but her line readings tend to be stiff and her face is rarely expressive. The highly quotable force-of-nature work she did in The Color Purple made no sense in a misbegotten yet misunderstood movie like Beloved. This performance is a breakthrough. She doesnt need that sorrowful blow-the-house-down stuff anymore. She no longer has to perform authority. She trusts herself to radiate it. You dont believe her as a housewife but you dont believe her in the right way because shes too glamorous to stay home. Winfreys not a mother. Shes a matriarch. The thing to love about Daniels is his sense of campiness and kitsch the idea that nothing is above reproach. Nothing can be taken out of historical or artistic proportion. In the first 10 minutes he frames Mariah Carey (as Cecils mother) and Vanessa Redgrave (as Cecils owner) with the same deadened face from almost the same angle so that you cant tell which of them is the acting legend. The Butler doesnt care that none of the men playing any of those presidents -- or the women playing their wives -- is right for the part. Minka Kelly is Jackie O Cusack makes a comically pathetic Nixon. He appears to be melting before our eyes. Nelsan Ellis plays Martin Luther King Jr. and doesnt go for too much. He just mingles with his staff in his room at the Lorraine Motel being casually wise. Then theres Jane Fonda who has a few short scenes of overwinking irony as Nancy Reagan. Theres an amusing shot of her making an exit using Reagans borderline-seasick walk. You can imagine Fonda being pleased to lampoon Nancys occasional lack of grace. A lot of what this miscasting does is restore these icons to an approachable human scale. But once the kitsch and campiness take hold its hard for Daniels to free himself from them. A scene between two characters standing amid Southern slave quarters gets a big laugh because the two characters are wearing vinyl 227-era tracksuits. But those sorts of unserious details start to matter over on Louiss half of the movie. (Hes Jenny to Cecils Forrest.) As he and Carol travel through the greatest and worst hits of the civil rights movement (they too are present for most iconic moments) as preppies Panthers and protesters clad in kente cloth it begins to feel like Halloween. The Afros and black berets and cut-out shirts and dashikis are wearing them instead of the other way around. With historical events Danielss knowingly disrespectful kind of badness has its limits. He might have wanted to show us how to make an irreverent historical epic. But hes just reimagined Saturday Night Live as sketch dramedy. People really like Chloe Grace Moretz in the Kick-Ass movies. She plays a foul-mouthed vigilante called Hit Girl. Originally the gag was that an 11-year-old had a dirtier mouth and faster hands than Nicolas Cage who played her dad. In Kick-Ass 2 shes 15 and both Cage and the thrill are gone. A tough trash-talking tween was a naughty novelty. But throw a rock and youll hit the teenage version. The first movie which Matthew Vaughn directed gave us ordinary people who wanted to be comic-book superheroes. It had the kind of high energy that could distract you from how appallingly that energy was deployed. Of course being appalling seemed to be that movies point. The sequel is also based on comic books by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. but was adapted and directed by Jeff Wadlow whose previous movie was 2008s adolescent-boy fight bulletin Never Back Down a stupid but fascinating brawl-a-thon that feels like more of a comic book than these civilian superhero movies -- its Kick-Ass too. Wadlows sequel has a blunt literal vulgarity. One characters slatternly alter ego is ""Night Bitch."" Christopher Mintz-Plasse resumes his part as the movies lisping douche-geek villain and he comes up with a new name for his character after frying his mother in a tanning bed and finding her Samp;M paraphernalia. Mintz-Plasse sells it. (Hes like an undergrad Ed Helms.) But after 20 minutes its clear that subversive wit or big ideas wont be factors for Round 2. (Oh and Morris Chestnut and John Leguizamo are on hand for glorified butler duty.) Once again Aaron Taylor-Johnson is Dave Lizewski a New York City high school nerd who becomes Kick-Ass by night and once again he manages to be more interesting than almost anybody you can imagine in a role this generic (hes 23 and can act; that helps). Its not Tobey Maguires Peter Parker. But thats only because the material doesnt give Taylor-Johnson a lot to perform. Moretz tries to toughen him up for crime-fighting which her character Mindy reluctantly renounces. Instead she becomes a plain-old high school girl. So Dave joins a league of homemade heroes which includes Donald Faison and Jim Carrey in a crew cut and disfiguring face makeup. The sequel has some good gags too. High school plus Hit Girl basically equals Heathers. But all the wonder and surprise of the first movie is gone. Its just aping the violence in other movies and other comic books. It doesnt feel quite real but it doesnt feel fantastical either. That violence drove Carrey whos 51 and a dad now to risk spending the rest of his life as a Comic-Con villain by renouncing his participation citing the Sandy Hook-ness of it all. But the fact that he spends the movie dressed like an impostor of himself suggests he had kind of changed his mind before the cameras even began rolling.

Such a meeting of the generations provided such a perfect symbol of a changing America its no surprise it inspired this fictionalised version. Yet somehow this broadly positive central idea works against the more complex themes underpinning Precious director Lee Danielss potted tale. We grasp the big idea from the off as elderly Forest Whitaker waits in the White House lobby for you-know-who to arrive. So when a flashback returns us to the unforgiving 1920s Deep South the future pattern of the movie playing Whitakers symbolic black experience against the historical milestones of successive presidencies (represented by high-profile cameos from Robin Williams John Cusack Alan Rickman and others) already seems set in stone. As such The Butler proves a decent significant but slightly stodgy affair. Its dignified restraint stifles its anger. The devil is in the detail though since Whitakers admirably controlled performance shows a man so worn down by presenting a docile front for his employers that hes unable to grasp the worth of his college-educated sons civil rights radicalism. Theres even appreciation for the fortitude of the housewife caught between the two men (Oprah Winfrey alternately sassy and very affecting) typifying the films generosity of spirit towards the spectrum of black America. The result isnt as powerful as it should be. But its still cheering to see a film whose moral journey has little to do with the usual Hollywood chestnut of white middle-class consciousness-raising.

"Butler The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; butler-the ) Butler The (United States 2013) August 17 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Calling Forrest Gumpa| Calling Forrest Gumpa| With The Butler director Lee Daniels has managed to ""Gump"" the Civil Rights movement. Thats not necessarily a bad thing but there are times when so many famous cameos threaten to become a distraction especially since theyre only tangentially germane to the main story. Watching the trailers and commercials one gets the sense that this is a White House version of Upstairs Downstairs. In reality however that material is only a sidelight. The Butler is about the different worldviews a father and son exhibit during the turbulent 60s 70s and 80s and the rift that develops between them as a result. The early scenes transpire in the Deep South during the 1920s when the post-slave mentality was still in full swing. Field workers were only technically ""free"" - they toiled for almost no wages for white overlords who could mistreat them with impunity. Cecil Gaines (who will grow up to be played by Forest Whitaker) is a cotton picker who watches as his father is gunned down in cold blood by one of the owners of the plantation. Cecil is invited by the somewhat sympathetic matriarch Annabeth Westfall (Vanessa Redgrave) to work in the house. Years later after moving on he functions as a butler in an upscale hotel where he learns the importance of silence and anticipating what the customer wants. This leads to him be offered a plum job at the White House where he serves every president from Dwight Eisenhower (Robin Williams) to Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman). Cecils home life however is filled with discord. His loving wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) is an alcoholic who resents the time Cecil devotes to his job. His son Louis (David Oyelowo) uses college as a path to civil rights activism. Louis activities which involve mostly peaceful protests result in him being threatened by the KKK beaten up and incarcerated. After concluding that Martin Luther Kings passive approach isnt working he becomes radicalized and falls into the ""black power"" movement as a member of the Black Panthers. The Butler (which is technically called Lee Daniels The Butler for legal reasons not because Daniels is an egomaniac) is loosely based on the real-life events of White House butler Eugene Allen who served under eight presidents. According to interviews while substantial ""dramatic license"" was taken with Allens personal life everything depicted within the White House actually happened. The irony is that the White House scenes are among the least effective. The movie shines when it focuses on the fractious relationship between Cecil and Louis whose divergent perspectives on the role of the black man in America provides the point of friction. For Cecil who grew up as a servant the way to advance in life is to be hard-working and non-confrontational. For Louis it means forcing the issue and taking a stand. This conflict which played out in millions of families during the 1960s and 1970s is underrepresented in cinema and Daniels gives it its due here. Stunt casting undermines the White House scenes. Three presidents dont have actors stand in for them Truman isnt mentioned and Ford and Carter are briefly seen only in old news footage. The other five are portrayed by well-known actors and theres not an unqualified casting success among them. The best of a weak bunch is Liev Schreiber as Lyndon B. Johnson although its an imperfect match at best (although the toilet scene is priceless). James Marsden offers an excellent mimicry of the Kennedy voice but the physical resemblance is only passing. Robin Williams (as Eisenhower) and Alan Rickman (as Reagan) are completely wrong with ludicrous makeup that never hides the actor. The worst of the worst however is John Cusack as Nixon. Cusack looks and sounds nothing like the 37th President and his half-hearted attempts at imitation are unconvincing. The end result of all this is that the White House scenes become less a game of ""spot the President"" and more one of ""spot the actor."" The main cast in contrast to the presidential roster is strong with fine performances emerging from roles large and small. Forest Whitaker imbues his part with immense dignity and the old-age makeup is effective showcasing Cecil during his later years. David Oyelowo gives a powerful portrayal of the firebrand Louis - one can feel the characters anger at the world in general and his frustration with his fathers passivity. A supporting actor nomination isnt out of the question. Oprah Winfrey does good things with an underwritten role and limited screen time. She hasnt been this effective since her debut in 1985s The Color Purple (although to be fair she hasnt taken many acting jobs since then). Other notable supporting players include Cuba Gooding Jr. Lenny Kravitz and Vanessa Redgrave. The Butler is the latest of several 2013 movies to address the subject of race relations in America. 42 like The Butler does this by using an historical lens while Fruitvale Station is contemporary. The Butlers ""hook"" is the opportunity to see how the dynamics within The White House changed from administration to administration over the course of the second half of the 20th century. While theres some of that its not where the movies heart lies. Its when Daniels takes us out of the rarefied atmosphere of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and into the trenches of segregation (and integration) that the film catches fire. Thats the reason to see The Butler - not to cringe at John Cusacks bizarre turn as Richard Nixon.

Grade B This turbulent emotionally overpowering movie about an African-American family had to be called ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" because of a wrangle over title rights between this films distributor the Weinstein Co. and Warner Bros. which owns a 1916 silent film called ""The Butler."" But did the credits have to say ""Inspired by a true story"" when except for several anecdotes its fiction? The catalyst for this movie was Wil Haygoods 2008 Washington Post article about Eugene Allen a black butler who worked in the White House for eight presidents and 34 years before retiring in 1986. The finished film though is about a composite White House butler named Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker). At its core is a decades-long father-son conflict thats all made up. The movie succeeds at evoking the public agony of black protesters like the Freedom Rider son and the private torment of the father who minds his tongue while serving white politicians who debate the future of his race. ""The Butler"" demonstrates that in this supposed Golden Age of Television nothing can beat a theatrical film at sweeping through a half-century of our common experience in two intense provocative hours. But it errs badly when it fictionalizes the butlers family life to serve an ideological concept. In the forward to Haygoods movie-spinoff book (""The Butler A Witness to History"") director Daniels articulates his vision ""While the father witnessed directly the role each president played in dictating the course of civil rights the son rebelled against what he perceived as the subservience of his father. He aggressively took his fight for equality to the streets."" Daniels writes that he wanted to create ""a story of healing ... as each man came to respect the pivotal and essential role the other played in the course of changing history."" Dramatically its a phony equivalency. The great virtue of ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" is that it reveals the quiet heroism of a man who learns the protocols of a racially divided world and finds his strength through service to his family and his country. When it trumps up an existential crisis that causes the butler to adopt his sons activist ways it rings false. The real Eugene Allen treasured the time the Reagans invited him and his wife to a state dinner. For this films Cecil Gaines the evening triggers a crisis of confidence. He then acts in a manner that undermines his belief in the authenticity of his lifes work. He goes beyond respecting his sons position - Daniels stated goal - to adopting it. Daniels skill with actors far surpasses his didactic storytelling. Whitaker plays Gaines a product of the lynching era and the Jim Crow South as a stoic with his own stored wisdom not as some old mossback who cant hear whats blowin in the wind. Although Whitaker can pull off the elegant moves of a first-class steward what distinguishes his performance is its unflashy vigor and gravity. He anchors the movie without weighing it down - or losing his own capacity for eruptive passion. Luckily he and David Oyelowo as Gaines rebellious older son Louis strike a deep sympathetic chord. As Louis zigzags from Woolworths counter sit-ins to Freedom Rides and then jarringly into militant Black Power Oyelowo imbues him with simmering intelligence and real if conflicted family feeling. He and Whitaker transcend melodrama to epitomize the generational rifts that rent most American households black and white during the Civil Rights/Vietnam epoch. The glimmers of family loyalty in the son are always stirring. Gaines anger at Louis disrespect can be scary heartbreaking - and marvelous. Oprah Winfrey is even better as Gaines long-suffering wife Gloria. Who could have predicted that the master of TV talk would deliver such a magnificent performance - much of it between the lines? She moves into the role of a traditional spouse and makes it her own. She expresses the nurturing instinct and the tension of a woman left with her children while her husband works long hours. She enables us to feel the sons absence as keenly as Gloria does. One stays in the country but is estranged from his father while the other goes to Vietnam. As Gloria drifts into drinking Winfrey embodies a changeable blend of need and disappointment without overplaying it. She doesnt glamorize the character when she falls into a dangerous friendship with her next-door neighbor (the terrifically flirtatious Terrence Howard). Because of Winfreys skill at conveying an emotional blur Glorias moments of clarity become electric. After a heated discussion about Sidney Poitier Glorias visceral reaction to her disrespectful son is as resonant as Poitier smacking a white man at the peak of ""In the Heat of the Night."" Danny Strong the actor-screenwriter who wrote the script renders history in Washington and the Deep South as a series of ""You Are There"" high points. Its as if he were shuffling together decks of flash cards - now were in Birmingham and now were outside Saigon. But his acting experience comes through in juicy lines and a cunning theatrical setup. This is a tale of two White Houses - the one in which Gaines serves Eisenhower (Robin Williams) Kennedy (James Marsden) LBJ (Liev Schreiber) Nixon (John Cusack) and Reagan (Alan Rickman) and the one across town where he strives to hold his family together. ""Downstairs"" at the White House the shared standards and loyalty of a group of expert butlers - suave Colman Domingo ruminating Lenny Kravitz and effervescent Cuba Gooding Jr. - conjure a vibrant esprit de corps. At the other house Whitaker and Winfreys magical chemistry puts across how profoundly moving it can be when a couple achieves complete understanding and rapport. The high-powered cameos are widely variable though Williams is superbly restrained as Ike and Schreiber is robust and vivid as Johnson Marsden is miscast as JFK (he seems to be playing RFK). But the filmmakers decision to highlight the butlers connection with them pays off. Its as if when he faces them every part of his being is channeling the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ""I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. You can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be.""

By Peter Rainer Film critic August 16 2013 Save for later Saved Oprah Winfrey (l.) and Forest Whitaker (r.) star in Lee Daniels The Butler. Anne Marie Fox/The Weinstein Company/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" - thats the official title but we can just call it ""The Butler"" - is about Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) a server at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. between 1957 and 1986.  His story is loosely based on the life of Eugene Allen a White House butler who died in 2010. Cecils life spans his boyhood in the brutally segregated South to the election of President Obama. His wife Gloria played by Oprah Winfrey in her first dramatic role since 1998s ""Beloved"" stands by him through all the tumult - the Freedom Rides and the assassinations and race riots. Their son Louis (David Oyelowo) regards Cecil as an Uncle Tom and becomes radicalized in the Black Power movement. Gloria battles alcoholism. Throughout it all amid much indignity Cecil maintains his pride.Ungainly and overly ambitious ""The Butler"" tries to encompass too much history within too narrow a framework. Daniels utilizes Cecil as a ""Zelig""-like character to reflect three decades of social and racial upheaval. Although Whitaker gives a sturdy commendable performance his character is made to bear too much symbolic weight. And having a parade of presidents hurried through the piece - played none too convincingly by Robin Williams (Eisenhower) James Marsden (Kennedy) Liev Schreiber (Johnson) John Cusack (Nixon) and Alan Rickman (Reagan) - only adds to the films once-over-lightly flashcard quality.Winfrey is good though demonstrating yet again that shes an actress and not just a celebrity playing an actress. Moments in this film particularly in the aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. hit home. Given the subject matter how could they not? But its also a bit weird - almost Pirandellian -- watching Winfrey play a woman who cries during Obamas election victory speech. In that moment its unavoidable Were not watching Gloria were watching Oprah the presidents close friend and major touter.

At area theaters. Octogenarian Cecil Gaines sits in a White House hallway waiting for a historic appointment in ""Lee Daniels The Butler."" Portrayed with a special brand of grace and ache by Forest Whitaker Cecil has a memory. It is of two men hanging bodies pressed together in the dark of night high above a street. The lighting the angle of the camera shot itself offer up the strange and bitter fruit Billie Holiday first sang of in 1939. A history lesson in violence and endurance. A sentimental journey. A tribute. Director Daniels and the dedicated cast of ""The Butler"" deliver all that. The movie traces the Civil Rights era through the experiences of Gaines as he serves seven presidential administrations but also as he lives at home with his wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) and their sons Louis and Charlie. Screenwriter Danny Strong took his inspiration from journalist Wil Haygoods 2008 Washington Post article about Eugene Allen the White House butler who served from 1952 to 1986 and lived to see a black man become president of the United States. Cecil is a composite of Allen and other White House employees. ""The Butler"" is epic. It opens in Macon Ga. in 1926 and ends shortly after the election of President Barack Obama. Daniels weaves actual broadcast images from the Civil Rights movement into his story which finds Cecils oldest son Louis growing increasingly engaged in the movements for racial equality. Daniels works deeply with actors. The performances are sharply nuanced. Winfreys turn is carnal and wise; Gloria is a mix of love frustration and need. David Oyelowo is responsible for the greatest arc as Cecil and Glorias son Louis. Elijah Kelley provides sweetly fresh moments as younger son Charlie. The father-son conflict provides a believable parable about the strategic tensions in the black community over the best course to equality. The parent-child conflict reverberates beyond politics -- or race. The cast is a star-driven affair without the vanity Vanessa Redgrave is a plantation matron. Robin Williams Liev Schreiber and John Cusack portray presidents. Alan Rickman and Jane Fonda are disarmingly appealing as Ronald and Nancy Reagan. Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz do illuminating work as Cecils co-workers at the White House. Terrence Howard waxes seductive and galling as Cecil and Glorias longtime friend. In another era ""The Butler"" could have been a mini-series the mixed-genre child of ""Roots"" and ""Upstairs Downstairs."" What happens in Cecil and Glorias D.C. row house is as revealing of this nations journey as the goings-on in that other house.

They belong in what Dennis Bingham author of Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre calls ""a respectable genre of very low repute."" Both movies trip over the usual bio-hazards - gratuitous montages speechifying characters and plots with historical incidents layered between private crises - but they play out in very different ways. Multimedia The Butler The official trailer Multimedia Jobs The official trailer Lee Daniels The Butler (the directors name was imposed after a legal dispute forbid the use of The Butler) stars Forest Whitaker as a long-serving White House butler during a turbulent period. The film has a lot of momentum thanks to a star-studded ensemble cast including Whitaker in the titular role and Oprah Winfrey in her first big-screen role in 15 years. The filmmakers claim that The Butler was inspired by the late Eugene Allen a White House employee who worked for presidents from Truman to Reagan and lived to see the first black president. But Allens story has little to do with The Butlers script a Forrest Gump-like tale of a servant who was a front-row witness to modern civil-rights history. The butlers name has been changed to Cecil Gaines.As a filmmaker Daniels (Precious The Paperboy) likes things pulpy and you quickly get the sense that he cant restrict himself to the Masterpiece Theatre model here. The Butler starts with an entirely fabricated sequence straight out of a Blaxploitation movie in which pre-teen Cecil witnesses his mothers rape and his fathers murder. The killers mom (Vanessa Redgrave) takes the boy into her house where he learns to serve and shut up. Eventually Cecil (played by a slim and convincingly youthful Whitaker) marries Gloria (Winfrey) and has two sons before being hired at the White House. Though hes instructed to see and hear nothing he is invariably hovering over the shoulder of one president or another during critical historical moments.Screenwriter Danny Strong who wrote the sharp television satire of the Sarah Palin campaign Game Change offers the usual biographical double strands of the characters public and private roles. One of Cecil and Glorias improbable friends is Howard (Terrence Howard) a layabout numbers-runner with a missing front tooth and a yen for Gloria. Gloria turns to drink and adultery when Cecil puts the presidents needs before his wifes which provides Oprah with some juicy scenes. The couple also has two opposite-minded sons. Louis (David Oyelowo) under the influence of his groovy college girlfriend Carol (Yaya Alafia) joins the wave of northern students who pushed for desegregation in the south in 1961. Little brother Charlie (Elijah Kelley) meanwhile signs up for duty in Vietnam.By contrast the White House feels like comic relief with a parade of presidential caricatures pensive Dwight Eisenhower (Robin Williams) who ponders sending federal troops to enforce school integration while painting flowers; awkward vice-president Richard Nixon (John Cusack) found in the kitchen scrounging for snacks; bumptious Lyndon Johnson (Liev Schreiber) who bellows instructions to his cabinet while seated on the toilet; and folksy Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman) whose smoothly controlling wife Nancy is played by former lefty activist Jane Fonda.Some of this is fun if heavy-handed but from time to time Daniels broad approach hits home emotionally particularly a scene that contrasts preparations for a White House state dinner with black students being spat upon and cursed for sitting on the white side of a segregated Woolworths counter. The Butler may be a sanctimonious cartoon but it points to events in the civil rights struggle that were as grotesque and extraordinary as any fiction can invent.Speaking of invention its difficult to know what motivated this pedestrian biopic of the late inventor Steve Jobs beyond a posthumous declaration that he was right after all. The movie follows a 20-year period from Jobss college days to his presentation of the iPod in 2001 and stars Ashton Kutcher who does a good impersonation of the Apple co-founders hunched over posture and reedy voice. But did Jobs actually strut around like the hero of an Ayn Rand novel alternately making inspirational speeches about the future and denouncing the fools who tried to compromise his vision? If so why did anyone like him?We begin with the familiar story of the aspiring genius dropping out of college heading to India then dropping acid in a scene in which Jobs spins in a wheat field and presumably gazes into our collective wired future.A couple of years later Jobs convinces his sweet-natured chubby friend Steve Wozniak that they should build and sell personal computers. Woz though kind of a genius himself cant believe anyone would want to own a computer. (The real Wozniak who is consulting on another movie about Jobs written by Aaron Sorkin says the scene is nonsense Everybody wanted a computer.).Investor Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) brings in much-needed cash to convert a garage into a lab and manufacturing plant.Triumphs and setbacks and more triumphs follow. Director Joshua Michael Stern and writer Matt Whiteley show Jobss cruel side - dumping a pregnant girlfriend (Ahna OReilly) and cutting founding partners out of the companys astronomical profit - proving the movie is not hagiography.Actually its something much duller a career summary. The films last half follows Jobss loss of Apple and then his comeback in the nineties when he turned the company around depicted as a series of boardroom power plays before Jobs emerges as the hero of a new generation of Apple underlings who pledge allegiance to his credo of radical excellence.In a recent interview on The Colbert Report Kutcher said he felt the movie was about how Steve Jobs lacked love in his life but found it from customers appreciation of his beautiful products. I wish the movie had communicated any of that. If Jobs had been a producer on Jobs he would have sent it back to the lab for a redesign.

He likes extremes -- screaming mothers throwing televisions at their daughters tarty women urinating on jellyfish victims casting ideas that are often little more than stunts. Yet given a good actor he can get a very good performance and ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" has two dandy ones at its heart. The movie is loosely based on a real story. Very loosely in fact and its not only the names theyve changed. In real life for example the title character -- who served presidents from Eisenhower through Reagan -- was a quiet man with a devoted wife and a single respectful child. He did not reportedly have a painfully rocky marriage a fiery relationship with his radical son or any of the other soap-opera troubles the script has handed him here. If he hadnt already passed seeing the melodrama theyve turned his life into would probably send him reeling. But a fact-filled bio is not what Daniels is interested in. What he wants to do very simply is tell the long bloody story of modern black America -- from the days of cotton-picking and lynchings to the lunch counter sit-ins to the Black Panthers and beyond. And what he also wants to do -- in a sort of unspoken but gentle rejoinder to ""The Help"" ---is to tell that history not chiefly through the eyes of a liberal white girl but solely through the experiences of two black men born a generation apart. The first ambition is a large undertaking and the second is a laudable approach but they require some awfully big contrivances on the part of screenwriter Danny Strong. The father is always in the Oval Office when race is being discussed; his son is there in the thick of it at every historic event. Daniels meanwhile has fatally indulged his own weakness for bizarre casting. In the past some of these ideas worked (MoNique and Mariah Carey in ""Precious"") and some didnt (Macy Gray in ""The Paperboy). Here though they never rise above the level of a bad joke. Robin Williams is Dwight D. Eisenhower Liev Schreiber is Lyndon B. Johnson At best the actors never convince; at worst the choices feel like Daniels own not very sly jokes (casting the radical John Cusack and Jane Fonda as Richard M. Nixon and Nancy Reagan say or Severus Snape himself Alan Rickman as the Gipper). But theyre not what makes the movie. Forest Whitaker is. A large man with a gentle mien Whitaker can be a great actor especially when he twists that persona around (as he did with his Oscar-winning work in ""The Last King of Scotland""). Too often though he doesnt get that chance and merely roams the edges of movies. (Is there anyone whos done more ensemble work?) Here though he has the opportunity to do more and to create a fully dimensional person -- an immensely decent and patient man who answers rudeness with quiet dignity and whose unfailing elegance and tireless work ethic give the lie to every racist slur. Whitakers work is beautifully controlled throughout and hes partnered well by Oprah Winfrey as his wife. Its too bad she hasnt been given more of a character to play -- she can be a bit of a one-note nag a wife who drinks and grumbles because her husbands always at work -- but Winfrey also gives her life and laughter and yes lustiness. ""The Butler"" is not a great movie. Its too obviously a careful tour through American history and while some sequences work -- particularly the various attacks on civil-rights workers -- too much of it feels as flat and cheap as a film strip. But its a movie with two great performances in it. And expect to hearing a lot more about both of them before this years awards season is done. Ratings note The film contains strong language alcohol abuse and violence. Lee Daniels The Butler (PG-13) Weinstein (113 min.) Directed by Lee Daniels. With Forest Whitaker Oprah Winfrey.

"The Butler reviewed Lee Daniels and Forest Whitaker lead a whirlwind tour through 20th-century race relations. Slate Sign In Sign Up Lee Daniels The Butler Is Uneven Yet Undeniably Powerful Lee Daniels The Butler Is Uneven Yet Undeniably Powerful Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 15 2013 903 PM Lee Daniels The Butler A whirlwind tour of 20th-century race relations through the eyes of a White House servant. By Dana Stevens Robin Williams and Forest Whitaker in Lee Daniels The Butler Photo courtesy of The Weinstein Co. After youve seen Lee Daniels The Butler come back and listen to our Spoiler Special Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The director Lee Daniels (Precious The Paperboy) has never been one to use a subtle technique when an obvious one would work just as well. Daniels blunt go-for-broke approach provides for many clunky moments (and some unintended chuckles) in his ambitious new film The Butler (officially titled because of a petty intellectual-property quibble among studios Lee Daniels The Butler). But the directors sometimes absurd bravado--along with Forest Whitakers grave wise performance in the title role--is what gives this outsized and sometimes lumbering film its irrefutable emotional power. Taking as his point of departure the real-life story of a black White House butler who served under eight consecutive presidents Daniels attempts to combine an intimate portrait of a single black family with a history of race relations in late-20th-century America. The resulting movie is a curious melange of politically conscious kitchen-sink drama and sweeping historical epic Killer of Sheep meets Roots. But even when the seams between these two stories and storytelling styles are at their most evident The Butler manages to keep barreling forward and to take the audience along with it. Advertisement Whitakers heavily fictionalized version of the real-life Eugene Allen (who retired from the White House midway through the Reagan administration and lived long enough to vote for Obama before passing away in 2010) is named Cecil Gaines. The son of a Georgia plantation worker (Mariah Carey in the first of a long string of distracting casting stunts) Cecil is taken in as a ""house nigger"" by the owner of the plantation (Vanessa Redgrave) after his father is killed by her odious rapist son (Alex Pettyfer). As an adult Cecil heads north to find work as a waiter in a Washington D.C. hotel where his polished professionalism attracts the attention of a White House staffer. After an interview with the condescending head butler (Colman Domingo) who coldly informs him that ""we have no tolerance for politics in the White House"" Cecil joins the staff and begins to work his way through the ranks. Except that for a White House employee of color working ones way through the ranks involves few concrete gains in title prestige or salary. As is made clear in two separate negotiating scenes between Cecil and his white supervisor the pay gap between white and black workers at the presidential residence goes unclosed and unquestioned over the course of decades. Through it all Cecil remains a loyal and deeply committed employee; in fact his perfectionism about his work is such that his wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) considers herself something of a White House widow and she assuages her loneliness and resentment by drinking too much and carrying on with their layabout neighbor (Terrence Howard). Gloria and Cecils oldest son Louis (David Oyelowo) is less than thrilled with what he perceives as his fathers Uncle Tom status in the halls of power. As he grows up Louis alienates Cecil by becoming increasingly involved in the civil rights struggle first leaving college to ride the Freedom Bus then getting hauled to jail with Martin Luther King Jr. then joining the Black Panther party with his more radical girlfriend (Yaya Alafia). Louis progress through the stations of black consciousness-raising is a far sight too schematically neat Theres a TV-miniseries quality to the way that every time we revisit the character his Afro has gotten bigger and his politics more extreme. But Oyelowo and Whitaker transcend the sometimes hokey material to establish a credible and moving father-son relationship--when theyre reunited after a period of estrangement you feel the weight of those lost years in their embrace. Cecil shares his sons Zelig-esque knack for being present on the sidelines of major historical developments. He watches Dwight D. Eisenhower (Robin Williams) agonize over the desegregation of Southern schools and discreetly bends the ear of Lyndon Johnson (Liev Schreiber) about the importance of passing the Civil Rights Act. (If you just did a double-take at those casting choices wait till you see John Cusack as a sweaty stammering Richard Nixon.) Its during this whistle-stop tour of pivotal moments in presidential history that The Butler is at its weakest. None of the actors playing presidents--not even Alan Rickman whos the most credible of the bunch as an unctuous Ronald Reagan--are given enough dialogue or onscreen time to emerge as anything more than wax figures (most of whom would not meet Madame Tussauds standards for verisimilitude). The speed with which The Butler caroms through major world events--did the Carter and Ford presidencies even get a scene apiece?--makes you wish it had been developed as a Roots-style miniseries. Then Daniels might have had time to explore the complexities of Cecils predicament as an African-American man eavesdropping on the very workings of power that function to keep him and his community in a position of subservience. Then again maybe Daniels isnt interested in exploring the complexities of his subject as much as illuminating its broader contours and there is something to be said for the bold brushstroke. The Butler can be preachy and mawkish but its heartfelt and honest and moving not to mention frequently funny. (And not just in those moments--cf. Cusack-as-Nixon--that were laughing at.) Winfreys performance as the blowsy hard-drinking but essentially good-hearted Gloria isnt exactly an accomplished feat of acting--you never forget shes Oprah--but such is the talk-show legends verve and chutzpah that she makes Gloria consistently fun to be around (especially in the late scenes when shes given the chance to dish out some dryly folksy old-lady humor). As for Whitaker he takes the smart risk of underplaying a role that could easily have been milked for its tear-jerking potential. If the emotional cues in the script are sometimes too predictable the expression on Cecils face never is--especially in a scene where invited for the first time to a White House state dinner he shifts anxiously under the suddenly impenetrable gaze of his own colleagues on the wait staff. A voiceover in which Cecil explains to us his conflicted feelings gilds the lily--Whitakers eyes are enough. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Try again? 15969866939003972267VNQ01-NPPRY071469833234165 By John Anderson August 15 2013 Any movie that casts Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan certainly has a piquant sense of humor but the prankishness of ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" -- so named after a title dispute with the MPAA -- undermines the serious statements this star-spangled film is striving to make about race class and politics. Along with missing the movies ever-migrating point viewers may be forgiven for wondering whether ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" might have been titled ""Lee Daniels Forrest Gump"" -- its hero challenged morally rather than mentally but watching history in Gumpian fashion as a series of cameos viewed through a slightly clueless daze. Inspired by the true story of Eugene Allen who served eight presidents during his tenure as a White House domestic and who was the subject of a 2008 Washington Post profile by Wil Haygood the film stars Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines who grows up amid Southern cotton fields witnesses the systematic abuse of his parents (Mariah Carey David Banner) and learns that one goes along to get along. Cecil spends the movie carrying Jim Crow on his back and fear in his eye; that he personifies both metaphorically and actually the ""good Negro"" of the American Racist Dream is never much of a question. But even as Cecil lives his life slightly adjacent to history building a heroic film around him requires herculean effort. Daniels certainly tries. The director of ""Precious"" (2009) and last years gleefully awful ""The Paperboy"" Daniels trails Cecil through his near-slave childhood a civil rights movement that impassions one son (David Oyelowo) a Vietnam War that draws in another (Elijah Kelley) and an election that results in the first African American president. What the film never settles on is a point of view Is the subservience that makes Cecil a success as a butler (""You hear nothing; you see nothing; you only serve"" hes told early on at the White House) something to be admired or decried? Is Cecil someone as a character in the film points out who by virtue of being hardworking and trustworthy defies racial stereotypes and advances his people? No his powerlessness ultimately is something shameful. But even as Daniels strains to emphasize the impotence Cecil feels as he watches cavalier decisions about black men being made by white men the director cant resist the commercial impulse to make Cecil a hero. And you cant quite have it both ways without making a movie with a personality disorder. On ""Precious"" Daniels was working from an Oscar-winning script by Geoffrey Fletcher but here he has a rather pedestrian screenplay by Danny Strong who scripted the TV movies ""Recount"" about the 2000 election and ""Game Change"" about the 2008 election. ""Its his world were just living in it"" Cecils father tells the boy (really?). In an exchange with his own son Louis (Oyelowo) whose Black Pantherism is yanking dads chain Cecil actually says ""I brought you into this world and I can send you out of it"" -- a line usually ascribed to Bill Cosby who does not appear among the credits. In addition to a standout performance by Oprah Winfrey as Cecils likably edgy sometimes boozy wife there are several moments of cagey insight. One involves Cecil pre-White House working at Washingtons Excelsior Hotel and suffering through a customers virulently racist rant about school desegregation. ""Never in my life"" Cecil says on voiceover ""did I dream Id work in a place as fancy as this."" Theres no irony to the statement just compartmentalization and denial. And its a moment that really stings. Cecils overlords -- those eight presidents under whom he serves -- include Dwight D. Eisenhower (Robin Williams) whom Cecil expects to help his people and doesnt; John F. Kennedy (James Marsden) who does despite being a few inches shorter than we remember; John Cusacks Richard M. Nixon who during some Watergate moments looks less like the late president than he does Orson Welles in ""Touch of Evil""; and Alan Rickmans Ronald Reagan who looks right but sounds wrong. The aforementioned Fonda is pretty much on point but overall theres very little effort made to transform actors physically or audibly into the people theyre supposed to be impersonating. Liev Schreiber isnt short for instance but neither is he tall enough for Lyndon B. Johnson and his Texas accent sounds like it might have originated at the southern end of Central Park. Its all stunt casting intended for cheap quick laughs and doesnt help a movie whose campaign already lacks a certain focus. Anderson is a freelance film critic in New York.  PG-13. At area theaters.

Comments (3) click to enlarge The Butler Recommended Video Rated PG-13  132 minutes  2013 Lee Danielss most commercial film to date is loosely based on the experience of Eugene Allen (1919-2010) a poor African-American who worked his way up the ladder to become head butler at the White House. Its structured like a conventional Hollywood biopic though Daniels consistently defamiliarizes the form with weird crass and nakedly sincere moments sometimes deploying all three within the same scene. The tone swerves from horrific (the depictions of lynchings and other racially motivated violence) to sentimental (the relationship between the apolitical title character and his activist son) to broadly comic (the burlesque characterizations of Richard Nixon Lyndon Johnson and Nancy Reagan) which feels oddly appropriate for a film about someone constantly struggling to assimilate into an unstable political environment. The movies a mess but a unique and provocative one. The all-star cast includes Forest Whitaker Oprah Winfrey David Oyelowo Cuba Gooding Jr. and John Cusack as Nixon.

Starring Forest Whitaker Oprah Winfrey and David Oyelowo. Directed by Lee Daniels. (PG-13. 132 minutes.) In ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" Cecil Gaines gets his dream job working at the White House and the very first time he walks into the Oval Office he finds President Dwight Eisenhower in a deep discussion over how to enforce Brown vs. the Board of Education in Arkansas. This pattern continues throughout Cecils White House career. He brings coffee to JFK just as the president is sitting in front of the TV watching black protesters getting manhandled by the police in the South. A year later he cant walk into the room without LBJ talking about the civil rights bill. A few years after that Richard Nixon is in office fretting with Bob Haldeman over the Black Panthers. And so it goes all the way up to Ronald Reagan who has a lot on his plate and yet somehow always happens to be talking about apartheid and South Africa whenever Cecil walks in. ""The Butler"" is a nice idea for a movie but has a mostly silly script and some of the craziest and most laughable casting imaginable. But the movies main challenge is a simple one It is very difficult next to impossible to build a movie around an inert inactive character. Cecil is a passive man with no power - not even the power to influence or teach by example. He just stands there and watches and there are only so many ways even a great actor like Forest Whitaker can make bewildered or stricken silence interesting. The film is based on the life of Eugene Allen an African American man from the Deep South who worked in the White House from the last year of the Truman administration until Ronald Reagans second term. The screenplay written by Danny Strong cuts out Truman and changes Allens name in order to turn his story into one about race relations in America from midcentury through the election of Barack Obama. To that end Strong gives the butler a son who is at first a Freedom Rider then an aide to Dr. Martin Luther King then a Black Panther then a congressional candidate and then an antiapartheid activist. Whatever is going on the son is involved and so whether at home or on the job Cecil cant get away from the story of his people. Heres the irony A simple honest telling of Allens life would have had plenty to say about race and history just as a matter of course; and it might have been the story of a man too. As it stands ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" is ""Zelig"" or ""Forrest Gump"" without the laughs - at least without the intentional laughs. Three things keep the movie outside the range of terrible. The first is that the history is interesting even when rendered in a ham-fisted and schematic way. The second is that Lee Daniels whose finesse abandons him in the White House scenes is very good in the ones depicting Cecils home life. The camera work is fluid the pace lively the interaction complex and the characters vivid. The movies third strength is in the way it uses the state dinner that Cecil attended in 1986. In real life Nancy Reagan invited Allen to the dinner when he told her he was retiring. The movie changes it and makes Allen want to retire after he attends the state dinner because something about crossing to the other side makes him not content to be a servant anymore. Its an arresting psychological detail and the movies best embellishment. Incidentally its rather amazing that it was Jane Fondas casting as Nancy Reagan that generated the most negative prerelease comment when Fonda it turns out nails the role while everyone else who plays a historical figure looks ridiculous. Robin Williams as Eisenhower? Actually with white hair he looks a little like Harry Truman but not Ike. James Marsden as JFK? Do you believe for a minute that guy was on a PT boat and saw action in the Pacific? And what was he assassinated for bad acting? But wait theres more. Liev Schreiber as Lyndon Johnson? Hes game but theres not much of a Texas vibe there. John Cusack as Nixon? He just mumbles and acts as if hes crazy. But worst of all is there anyone less like the smiling ebullient Ronald Reagan than the dark depressed deep-revolving Alan Rickman? Actually with the black wig Rickman looks pretty close to the original but like Reagan with bad indigestion. Also Rickman sounds nothing like him which is odd. After all virtually everyone over a certain age can do a passable impression of Ronald Reagan - you just shrug smile say ""Well"" and nod in a genial way. But no they hired the one guy who couldnt manage it. To say that all this bad casting is distracting is hardly enough. Every election brings another waxwork into the picture and another round of laughs. Its awful and yet its probably 80 percent of what fun there is here. Speaking of distracting Oprah Winfrey plays Cecils wife and shes quite a nice actress. At the same time its hard to ever forget youre looking at Oprah. Theres a certain point at which fame gets in the way though the novelty might fade if Oprah made more movies. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

The characters a fly on the wall of the civil rights struggle the Vietnam War Watergate and much more yet the movie is remarkable not for its ""Forrest Gump""-itude but for its unerring social portrait of a black middle class torn by the stress-fractures of an era. The cast is stacked with stars -- Oprah Winfrey as the heros wife Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz as his colleagues all sorts of surprises as the various commanders in chief -- but director Lee Daniels is focused on making us look hard at a man who thought the only way forward was to be invisible.

Its inspiring and filled with fine performances but the insistently swelling musical score and melodramatic moments seem calculated and undercut a powerful story.A revolving door of stars in quasi-cameos takes the audience out of the movie. Viewers will find themselves musing ""Wow Jane Fonda really looks like Nancy Reagan"" and ""Who knew Robin Williams could look so much like Eisenhower?"" or ""Wait was that catatonic woman Mariah Carey?""It is however refreshing to see a mainstream film dominated by black actors in which white actors have small supporting roles.Forest Whitaker is superb as Cecil Gaines a fictional domestic worker at the White House who served in seven presidential administrations from 1957 to 1986. The story is inspired by Wil HaygoodsWashington Post article about real-life presidential butler Eugene Allen. With exquisite subtlety Whitaker evokes the inner strength and concealed turmoil that belie his subservient post.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersGaines story begins when hes a child in 1926 picking cotton on a Georgia plantation. Disturbing events lead to Gaines working indoors as a servant for an imperious matriarch (Vanessa Redgrave). Forced into servility he learns fine manners. As a young man he runs away and lands a job at a tony Washington D.C. hotel. There he comes to the attention of an administration official who hires him to work at the White House.After his poverty-stricken childhood Gaines is grateful for work that allows him to support his wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) and sons Louis (David Oyelowo) and Charlie (Elijah Kelley). Focused on change Louis clashes with his more deferential father and becomes a Freedom Rider. One of the films most moving scenes features Louis protesting at a segregated lunch counter in the South juxtaposed with a white-gloved Gaines quietly serving a sumptuous meal at a White House dinner. Oyelowo gives a masterful performance as the film chronicles the civil rights movement and director Daniels offers a compelling look at the strikingly different ways two African-American men chose to deal with racial discrimination.Winfrey has substantial chemistry with Whitaker and gives a solid performance though its hard to forget were watching the TV star.STORY Forest Whitaker pours his heart into The ButlerVIDEO Oprah on her raunchy Butler scenesPREMIERE Oprah apologizes for bag-gate at The Butler premiereAt times the film comes off as a more serious-minded Forrest Gump in the way it superficially covers key events in U.S. history with Gaines thrust into these moments. The story is more successful when it focuses on Gaines point of view and how his job often bangs up against familial concerns. After President Kennedy (James Marsden) is shot a shattered Gaines stays late and approaches Jacqueline (Minka Kelly) still wearing her blood-stained pink suit inquiring if theres anything he can do to help. She is unresponsive. He goes home to find Gloria upset about family issues. They have a row over his paying more attention to what is going on in the White House than in his own home.The Butler brings into clear focus how the civil rights struggle paved the way for Barack Obama to become president. The film ends with just the right sense of portent after Obama is elected in 2008.As a sweeping multi-generational saga The Butler verges on heavy-handed. But its also poignant powerful and worth seeing. 474 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 51 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/13lZyRwSummer Movies Calendar AugustTake a look at the films heading to the box office this August complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

Glen Wilson/Open Road Films hide caption toggle caption Glen Wilson/Open Road Films Ashton Kutcher and Josh Gad stand in for Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in Joshua Michael Sterns biographical drama Jobs which covers the tech visionarys early career but stops short of his latter-day triumphs. Glen Wilson/Open Road Films Jobs Director Joshua Michael Stern Genre Biography Drama Running Time 127 minutes Rated PG-13 for drug use brief profanity With Ashton Kutcher Josh Gad Dermot Mulroney Lukas Haas Matthew Modine J.K. Simmons Lesley Ann Warren In their approaches to history Joshua Michael Sterns Jobs and Lee Daniels The Butler could hardly be less similar. The former is an example of Victorian-style great-man biography updated for the iThings era. The latter observes monumental events mostly involving the civil rights movement from an Everymans perspective. Yet the two movies have much in common. Neither seriously exerts itself to examine psychology or illustrate character. Nor does either offer significant challenges to conventional wisdom. Instead they proceed as historical pageants re-creating rather than reinterpreting the events they depict. Although some of Steve Jobs former associates have already complained about Sterns biopic the movie generally conforms to the known facts of the Apple co-founders career. The filmmakers even shot in Jobs childhood home whose garage became one of the worlds most celebrated. In fact this merely serviceable film tells the story in such detail that it doesnt have room for Jobs late-career triumphs. Save for a prologue set in 2001 the movie follows its flawed hero only from 1976 when hes a Reed College dropout who still hangs around the campus to 1996 when he returns to a foundering Apple after an 11-year exile. Along the way Jobs alienates most of the people who helped him notably Steve Wozniak (a fine Josh Gad) who did a lot more than his ambitious buddy to develop the Apples I and II. He also clashes with original financial backer Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) and the man he himself recruited to save Apple in the 1980s John Scully (Matthew Modine). Jobs failings -- his arrogance his greed his initial refusal to acknowledge paternity of his oldest child -- are well-documented. So the principal point of controversy involved here is not Jobs himself but Ashton Kutcher who plays him. The actors approach is to ape Jobs speech and movements which he does quite well. Whether mimicry qualifies as characterization is a question for Jobs viewers to answer for themselves. i Forest Whitaker turns in a reserved performance as Cecil Gaines butler to eight U.S. presidents including Robin Williams Dwight D.

Lee Daniels The Butler Director Lee Daniels Genre Biography Drama Running Time 126 minutes Rated PG-13 for violence profanity sexual situations alcohol abuse smoking With Forest Whitaker Vanessa Redgrave Oprah Winfrey Cuba Gooding Jr. Jane Fonda Lenny Kravitz Robin Williams John Cusack James Marsden Liev Schreiber Mariah Carey It will also prove a perplexity and on a larger scale for anyone who sees The Butler which is packed with stunt casting and distracting performances. Jane Fonda plays Nancy Reagan; a weirdly long-haired John Cusack does a Richard Nixon impression. The mood-breaking incongruities begin as soon as the 8-year-old Cecil Gaines watches his father shot dead in a Georgia cotton field The boy is rescued by an elderly Southern belle played by no less venerable a figure than Vanessa Redgrave. Also onboard and surprisingly believable is Oprah Winfrey as the older Gaines wife Based on a Washington Post story about a longtime White House butler Lee Daniels movie has been extensively fictionalized. The real-life equivalent of Cecil Gaines is Eugene Allen who grew up in Virginia not Georgia. He served eight presidents and their families and was apparently beloved of many of them. (He did not as The Butler would have it raise a son who provided facile dramatic counterpoint by joining the Black Panthers.) The movie is a two-hour tonal skirmish between the big stuff Gaines (Forest Whitaker) observes at work and the small stuff that happens at home. The latter feels reasonably authentic with the likes of Terrence Howard Cuba Gooding Jr. and David Oyelowo as well as Winfrey playing the discreet butlers boisterous friends relatives and neighbors. This side of the story would have worked better though if the filmmakers had paid attention to D.C. details. The occasional exteriors shot in Louisiana are laughable and Gaines assures President Eisenhower (Robin Williams) in 1957 that his sons attend an ""all-colored school"" -- even though Washingtons public schools integrated in 1954. Many of the White House scenes are jarringly motley as Whitaker maintains Gaines dignity against a series of performances that range from bland (James Marsdens JFK) to cartoonish (Liev Schreibers LBJ). It comes as a relief when Daniels reduces Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford to TV clips -- though that strategy makes the film even more of a stylistic jumble. The Butler is carried forward by the sweep of history though and Jobs will benefit from Apple fans devotion to the companys products. If these movies elicit cheers or even draw Oscar nominations the tributes will have been to the subjects more than to the treatments. These sagas are just too good to spoil -- which doesnt mean they didnt deserve better.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 The first images in Lee Daniels The Butler are of an elderly black man in a White House anteroom wearing a suit sitting upright flanked by a U.S. flag and a Marine - and of two black men dead hanging from nooses somewhere in the South. More about Lee Daniels The Butler >> Daniels the audacious filmmaker behind Precious Based on the Novel ""Push"" by Sapphire (whats with these clunky titles?) establishes his tactics from the get-go He is going to tell us the remarkable story (""inspired by the true story"") of an African American man who worked in the White House under eight administrations serving drinks and coffee and late-night snacks to every president from Truman to Reagan. And Daniels is going to tell us about the lynchings and rapes the beatings and ugly indignity set upon generations of black Americans in the course of the 20th century. From the hushed halls of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to the confrontation on the steps of Little Rocks Central High School from elegant state dinners to the whites-only lunch counters of Woolworth stores history unfolds. And Cecil Gaines the fictionalized incarnation of real-life White House butler Eugene Allen watched it unfolding - from the Oval Office and the first families residence a discreet witness to many of the milestone moments of the civil rights movement. The transition from Cecils childhood on a Georgia cotton farm to his days as a footman at a posh North Carolina hotel required the services of two young actors Michael Rainey Jr. and Aml Ameen but even so when we first see the adult Cecil in Washington circa 1957 Forest Whitaker looks as if he has been there all his life. The makeup artists had their work cut out for them trying to make Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey as Cecils hard-drinking chain-smoking wife Gloria much younger then much older than they are. If the stars gaits and girths hair and complexions arent always convincing the core of Whitakers performance certainly is The man is a burning ember of humility and pride and the actors soft hulking presence and searching eyes anchor the film. And the film with a screenplay credited to Danny Strong adapted from a Washington Post story by Wil Haygood is undeniably powerful. For all its faults - and there are many from shameless compression of events to milk the drama for all its worth to the gimmicky miscasting of several commanders-in-chief (Robin Williams as Eisenhower is especially egregious) - The Butler is an inspiring and important summation of the black struggle. Its a long way from the Freedom Riders of the 1960s to the election of the first African American president in 2008. Cecil Gaines with his white gloves his deferential bow his ""Is there anything else Mr. President?"" was a singular witness to it all. (The real-life butler Allen was invited to Obamas first inauguration.) At the White House Cuba Gooding Jr. Colman Domingo and Lenny Kravitz play Cecils fellow tuxedoed servants. At the Gaines home David Oyelowo is Louis the son who goes off to historically black Fisk University in Nashville and becomes radicalized joining the civil rights protests and spending more time in Southern jails than in lecture halls. He finds his way into the Memphis motel room where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was staying when he was assassinated then joins the Black Panthers - hes the Zelig of African American history. Elijah Kelley is Louis younger brother Charlie. And Terrence Howard sporting a gold tooth is the neighbor who keeps Gloria company on all those late nights when Cecil is busy at work. The Butler incorporates archival (and faked) news footage of pivotal episodes of the era the Kennedy assassination Vietnam the riots in the wake of Kings death. Liev Schreiber has some fun as Lyndon Johnson barking orders from the toilet with his trousers and his two beagles at his feet. And the casting of Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan is priceless. (Alan Rickman is ""Ronnie"" and also does a good job of mimicry.) As a filmmaker a storyteller Daniels has a propensity for pulp for domestic melodrama for characters who border on caricature. But he also has an instinct for the truth - emotional and historical. In The Butler he finds that truth and it triumphs. Lee Daniels The Butler  (Out of four stars) Directed by Lee Daniels.

"Review Lee Daniels The Butler significant but often contrived - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Lee Daniels The Butler significant but often contrived Lee Daniels The Butler Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" starring Forest Whitaker Oprah Winfrey John Cusack and David Oyelowo. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" starring Forest Whitaker Oprah Winfrey John Cusack and David Oyelowo. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" is neither as good as it might have been nor as bad as survivors of ""The Paperboy"" may have feared. An ambitious and overdue attempt to create a Hollywood-style epic around the experience of black Americans in general and the civil rights movement in particular it undercuts itself by hitting its points squarely on the nose with a 9-pound hammer.Strongly acted by a cast top-lined by Forest Whitaker Oprah Winfrey and David Oyelowo ""The Butler"" has its share of strong dramatic moments in a story inspired by the real-life career of a White House employee who served eight presidential administrations for a total of 34 years from 1952 to 1986. Written by Danny Strong (HBOs excellent ""Recount"" and ""Game Change"") ""The Butler"" cheerfully abandons specific reality with its main characters -- Cecil Gaines (Whitaker) his wife Gloria (Winfrey) and their son Louis (Oyelowo) -- crafted as composites to allow a wide swath of history to fit tidily into one familys tumultuous story.PHOTOS Forest Whitaker Career retrospective Getting involved in this kind of general audience material is something new for the director a lover of excess (""Precious"" as well as ""The Paperboy"") who candidly commented in publicity material ""As a filmmaker I really had to restrain myself. Its hard to do a PG-13 movie being Lee Daniels.""Though that rating imposes some constraints the directors contempt for subtlety weakness for cliche and perennial determination to wring every last drop of emotion out of a situation are inevitably factors here.Nevertheless ""The Butler"" reveals Daniels ability to create believable black middle class situations that are so hard to come by on mainstream screens. (It took the combined efforts of close to 40 different producers to finally make this film a reality.)PHOTOS 25 great Oprah moments But paralleling this gift and hampering ""The Butler"" is Daniels tin ear when it comes to white folks individuals who do not have a fraction of the recognizable humanity of the black characters even in the rare moments when theyre not being racists or morons or both.Five name actors from Robin Williams as Dwight D. Eisenhower through Alan Rickman as Ronald Reagan play presidents Cecil Gaines served and not one of them is remotely believable. Movie audiences whove suffered for decades with unrealistic portrays of African Americans and Native Americans in multi-racial pictures are now being asked to do the same with Caucasians.""The Butler"" starts with a brief moment in the White House entrance hall with an aged and long-retired Gaines patiently waiting we find out later to meet a newly elected (but unseen) Barack Obama.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013Then the film flashes back nearly eight decades to 1926 in Macon Ga. to an overly schematic (to put it mildly) world where 8-year-old Cecils happiness to be picking cotton with his father Earl (David Banner) is shattered when a drooling bigot (Alex Pettyfer) rapes his mother (Mariah Carey) and murders that father -- on the same afternoon. But not before Earl has a chance to warn his son ""Dont lose your temper with the man. Its his world were just living in it.""The drooling bigots mother (a thankless part for Vanessa Redgrave) turns young Cecil into a house servant. He leaves home when hes of age (no surprise) and another mentor helps him land a job at a hotel in Washington D.C. That leads to work at the White House where hes told by his new boss ""You never listen or react to conversation. You hear nothing you see nothing you only serve.""Fortunately for Cecil and the film his African American co-workers are a gregarious lot especially Carter Wilson (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and James Holloway (Lenny Kravitz) and the banter they exchange both on and off the job is one of the films strengths.VIDEO Upcoming summer filmsThe same is true for Cecils strong union with his wife which is helped by the obvious acting bond formed by the effective work of Whitaker and Winfrey. These two are especially good when Cecils long hours at the White House cause his wife to understandably feel neglected which leads to a prolonged flirtation with the rascal next door (the always effective Terrence Howard). When it comes to how Cecil and all those presidents interact ""The Butler"" does not achieve a similar realism. Whenever a president needs a sympathetic ear or a presidential child like young Caroline Kennedy is in search of a patient reader Cecil manages to be magically around.Where ""The Butler"" really starts to give off mixed messages is when Cecils son Louis comes of age. A thorn in his fathers side who sees the old man as an accommodating Uncle Tom type Louis heads off to Fisk University to begin both the study of nonviolent protest with James Lawson (Jesse Williams) and a relationship with classmate Carol Hammie (Yaya Alafia). PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie clubThough the generation-gap clashes between father and son over how best to confront institutional prejudice -- and over Sidney Poitiers acting abilities -- are another of the films strong points the plotting here becomes too contrived to be effective.""The Butler"" turns poor Louis into a kind of African American Zelig present at every key civil rights era turning point. Thats Louis sitting in at a Woolworths lunch counter getting fire-bombed on a Freedom Rider bus getting assaulted by a fire hose in Birmingham being with Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis just before he died donning a beret and becoming a Black Panther as Carols hair morphs into an Angela Davis afro.Its not that all this stuff didnt happen (see Stanley Nelsons excellent Emmy-winning doc ""Freedom Riders"" to get the full story) but it strains credulity to have it all happen to one person and all in the context of a strained father-son relationship.Daniels pulp instincts do lead to vivid sequences such as the intercutting of a White House dinner with that Woolworth sit-in but this is one significant film where less would have been a whole lot more.kenneth.turanlatimes.com ---------------------------Lee Daniels The ButlerMPAA rating PG-13 for some violence and disturbing images language sexual material thematic elements and smokingRunning time 2 hours 12 minutesPlaying In general release  PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Politics and Government Crime Law and Justice Social Issues Lee Daniels Discrimination Forest Whitaker Career retrospective At Butler premiere Oprahs big-screen return marked with fanfare For The Butler a cast of 37 producers Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-review-the-butler,0,581076.story",200,leedaniels'thebutler20,leedaniels'thebutler,latimes

By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Aug. 15 2013 309 p.m. ET ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" was inspired a title card says by a true story. That usually means the line between fact and fiction has been blurred but this time theres no line to blur. The butler Cecil Gaines is a fictional creation an African-American Forrest Gump who bears special witness to the civil-rights movement while serving on the White House staff under seven presidents. The contrivance is stretched to its breaking point over a running time of 132 minutes; some of the episodes cross a different line from almost plausible to downright silly. Thats not the whole story though. The movie borrows cumulative power from the eras tormented racial history through the use of news clips as well as through dramatic re-creations. And Forest Whitaker brings a quiet grandeur to the title role of a white-gloved Uncle Tom who ever so slowly radicalized by events becomes the proud black man he was born to be. First a word about the titles clumsiness and the storys provenance. The director Lee Daniels is no stranger to clumsy titles. Four years ago he was nominated for an Oscar for ""Precious"" a film whose contractual title was ""Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire."" His name appears in this contractual title because of a legal dispute over ""The Butler"" a silent comedy released by Warner Brothers 97 years ago. At the risk of provoking a major studio Ill call this one ""The Butler"" too after noting its distant relationship to Wil Haygoods 2008 article in the Washington Post about a black man named Eugene Allen who did in fact work as a White House butler under eight presidents. (But who did not as the movie has it read ""Madeleine"" to a 4-year-old Caroline Kennedy who in her turn did not interrupt the butlers reading to ask about a Freedom Riders bus that had just exploded in flames in Alabama.) ""The Butler"" is weakened by heedless overreaching and by spasms of ineptitude in Danny Strongs script. Cecils middle-class home life seldom rises above cliche even though Oprah Winfrey gives a fine incisive performance as his troubled wife and David Oyelowo is impressive throughout as their politically astute--and quickly radicalized--older son. (The cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr. as another White House butler and Terrence Howard who is wasted on the role of an amorous neighbor.) Related Video Watch a clip from the film ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" an African-American (Forest Whitaker) eyewitnesses notable events of the 20th century during his tenure as a White House butler. Also starring Oprah Winfrey and Mariah Carey. (Photo/Video TWC) Related Article How Forest Whitaker Became The Butler Robin Williams inflicts generic blandness on President Eisenhower who had a famously explosive temper. James Marsden comes closer to JFKs accent than to capturing his allure. We didnt need to see Liev Schreibers LBJ issuing orders from a toilet seat while scratching--though mercifully not pulling--the ears of his two beagles. Alan Rickman gives Ronald Reagan a resonant voice thats more redolent of Rickman than Reagan. Of all the films presidential impersonators only John Cusack fitted with a Cyrano nose scores points for suggestive wit as an intriguingly devious Nixon. Jane Fonda has a brief but commanding turn as Nancy Reagan who actually did for Eugene Allen what the movie shows her doing for Cecil Gaines--inviting the butler and his wife to a White House dinner as guests. ""The Butler"" promises more than mimicry and reprocessed history from the moment we hear Mr. Whitaker voice over during a preface set in the 1920s rural Georgia of Cecils harsh boyhood ""The only thing I ever knew was cotton"" Cecil says in a slow loamy voice of old age. And the film delivers sometimes startlingly so at certain points along the way--when Cecil effaces himself into invisibility while those he serves talk racist trash; polishes silver with studious concentration; burnishes his idealized notions of flawed chief executives; flies into a long-suppressed rage after his son scornfully derogates the significance of Sidney Poitiers films; struggles to understand the fervent audacity of young black activists; and lives to see the White House become the home of a black president (who in video clips is played by himself). At that climactic moment fiction merges with fact and finally soars. Cutie and the Boxer Watch a clip from the documentary film ""Cutie and the Boxer."" This candid New York love story explores the chaotic 40-year marriage of famed boxing painter Ushio Shinohara and his wife Noriko. (Photo/Video RADiUS-TWC) Zachary Heinzerlings feature-length documentary gathers force slowly but with such wisdom and calm mastery that I found myself stunned toward the end by the beautiful vastness of it all. The subject is at its simplest a troubled marriage that has somehow lasted for 40 years. Ushio Shinohara and his wife Noriko both born in Japan live on the edge of poverty in a second-floor Brooklyn walkup. He is 80 years old an artist of limited talent who had a passing flirtation with fame back in the 1960s as an action painter; his specialty was applying paint to canvas with boxing gloves. She is 59 an artist in her own right who has subordinated her abundant talent to her traditional Japanese role of supporting and serving her husband. ENLARGE Noriko and Ushio Shinohara RADiUS-TWC Yet nothing is simple in Mr. Heinzerlings debut film. The marriage serves both as canvas and frame for a complex story enriched by film and video clips from the couples past thats about more things than you can count while youre engrossed in it--romantic illusion self-delusion reluctant devotion passive aggression naked anger implacable perseverance the fateful lure of the bohemian life the transformational power of art and against the longest and cruelest of odds enduring love. The title comes from a series of cartoon-style drawings that Noriko has been turning out with a mixture of inspiration and desperation. Witty bold and bawdy they use surrogate characters--Cutie for her The Boxer for Ushio--to turn her turbulent life into vibrant art. Theyre so clearly appealing that feminists may cheer while movie fans may think of ""A Star Is Born"" with Noriko on the way up after all these decades of struggle and Ushio headed inexorably down. (The visual pleasures of the film which the filmmaker shot elegantly include charming little animations of Norikos wall-size cartoons. The musical pleasures flow from Yasuaki Shimizus remarkable score which includes a Bach cello suite as youve never heard it before.) ENLARGE Mr. Shinohara creates a boxing painting. RADiUS-TWC Whats equally wonderful though--maybe even more so--is that Mr. Heinzerling also brings us around to Ushios corner. Yes hes a drunk and a petty tyrant an ex-popinjay who preened in a flickering spotlight and talked big about artistic accomplishments that seem smaller with each passing year. But one of the heartbreaking revelations of those early film and video clips is that he knew himself to be mediocre and was haunted all along by the prospect of failure. (One of the countless questions that the story raises is whether Norikos failure to confront her husband during all those years deprived him of a chance to grow.) Ushio at 80 is still at it like a punch-drunk fighter except that hes remarkably strong for his age and unbowed by bitter experience. Seen from one angle hes a hopeless fool. Seen from another hes a figure of gallantry. Viewed in its entirety ""Cutie and the Boxer"" is more than a great documentary. Its a great film. Aint Them Bodies Saints? Watch a clip of film ""Aint Them Bodies Saints"" the tale of an outlaw who escapes from prison and sets out across the Texas hills to reunite with his wife and the daughter he has never met. (Photo/Video IFC) Time flows slowly in David Lowerys hypnotic third feature a doomed romance set in rural Texas in the 1970s. Casey Affleck is Bob Muldoon an outlaw escaped from prison and making his way back to the wife he adores Rooney Maras Ruth Guthrie and to the daughter hes never seen. Its a tone poem really less concerned with conventional action than with exploring themes of love and commitment through understated performances sumptuous images (Bradford Young did the cinematography) lovely music (Daniel Hart composed the score) and very few words intoned elegiacally. ENLARGE Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara IFC Films This is Terrence Malick territory; you might guess that with the sound turned off thanks to the bronze sunlight low on broad horizons. Still Mr. Lowery stakes out his own distinctive boundaries from the laconic ""This was in Texas"" title card at the start to the inevitable denouement with Bob murmuring poignantly ""Theres no tellin theres just no tellin."" (The title was taken not quite accurately from a folk song.) Ben Foster is superb as Patrick Wheeler a cop with a lyrical bent. Keith Carradine is a welcome presence as Bobs old friend Skerritt who protects Ruth and her daughter as best he can. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ""The Remains of the Day"" (1993) ENLARGE Anthony Hopkins turns repression into unexpressed passion in James Ivorys drama about an English butlers lifetime of service and unacknowledged love. The story adapted by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala from the Kazuo Ishiguro novel would seem unrelated to ""Lee Daniels The Butler."" James Stevens serves an aristocratic master and he cant allow himself to express what he feels for Emma Thompsons housekeeper Miss Kenton. The heroes of both films though are perilously slow to understand the changes sweeping society. If Ive made this one sound depressing it is in fact mysteriously moving. ""The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith"" (1978) ENLARGE A tale of racism Australian-style this is one of the least-known masterpieces in the cinema canon but Im still astonished to discover that I havent written about it until now. Its a harrowing--and at moments horribly violent--film set at the turn of the 20th century. Jimmie (Tommy Lewis) whos part aborigine has been raised by a white minister and his wife yet struggles to find a place in white society. Fred Schepisi directed brilliantly and adapted the script from a rigorously fact-based book of the same name by Thomas Keneally (""Schindlers List""). ""Thieves Like Us (1974) ENLARGE Keith Carradine is effortlessly endearing as Bowie the junior member of a larcenous trio recently escaped from prison. Shelley Duvall is his inamorata a wrenchingly plain and winsome girl named Keechie. Unlike ""Bonnie and Clyde"" a similar story of Depression-era bank robbers on the run Robert Altmans film an amalgam of sporadic action and doomed romance is often tender and wry and for the most part leisurely; its robbers start out on the meander.

(ANNE MARIE FOX) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday August 13 2013 214 PM Title Lee Daniels The Butler Film Info PG-13 Violence language. Area theaters. Opens Thursday night. Though it is a panorama that tilts more toward predictability than turbulence ""Lee Daniels the Butler"" melds two views of civil rights battles one watchful the other protest-filled. Yet it results in a singularly full-hearted and moving film. Thats surprising since the director whose name is in the title is not known for subtlety. Lee Daniels work (""Shadowboxer"" ""Precious"" ""The Paperboy"") has been flavorful sometimes to a fault. But ""The Butler"" inspired by a true story raises Daniels up. And its anchored by deep dexterous performances from Forest Whitaker and in her first major role in 15 years Oprah Winfrey. Whitaker is Cecil Gaines first seen approaching 90 years old. In a flashback to his boyhood on a cotton plantation in the 1920s young Cecils mother (Mariah Carey in a cameo) and father are brutalized. Out of pity the plantation matriarch (Vanessa Redgrave) moves Cecil into the house to teach him how to be a servant. Oprah Winfrey in Lee Daniels The Butler (ANNE MARIE FOX) As a teen Cecil apprentices under a hotel butler (Clarence Williams III) acquiring skills that get him a job as a waiter in a patrician D.C. club. In 1957 Cecils knowledge of drinks and -- most crucial in this era -- ability to sidestep questions about race from imbibing lawmakers get him noticed by a White House official. Soon Cecil is offered a job on the White House butler staff. At 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Cecil watches as President Eisenhower (Robin Williams) wrestles with the violence in Little Rock. Cecil later meets John F. Kennedy (James Marsden) and Jacqueline Kennedy (Minka Kelly) and sees the face of change; notices LBJ (Liev Schreiber) try to craft an uneven New Society; catches Nixon (John Cusack) asking the black staff about their lives and hears Reagan (Alan Rickman) veto sanctions against South Africa. At home Cecil and his wife Gloria (Winfrey) have a full life with friends and Cecils co-workers (including Cuba Gooding Jr. and Terrence Howard). In the 60s though their grown son Louis (David Oyelowo) rejects his parents passivity. Louis joins the Woolworths lunch counter sit-in in Greensboro N.C.; signs up to be a freedom rider and joins the Black Panthers. His activism disturbs them yet Cecil knows little is being done in the seat of power. Forest Whitaker with David Oyelowo in Lee Daniels The Butler (ANNE MARIE FOX) ""The Butler"" is based on the life of the late Eugene Allen who rose to the position of White House maitre d and lived long enough to be invited to Barack Obamas inauguration in 2009. The film concludes with the Obama election and rarely has a film used recent events for such dramatic impact. Daniels does a beautiful job with the understated poetry in the screenplay by Danny Strong (""Recount"" ""Game Change"") never trivializing how the bigger stories of this countrys civil rights struggles are seen in Cecils eyes. Here they are one and the same. Playing the soul behind those eyes Whitaker is as ever remarkable. He makes Cecil proud and strong even when his position demands he be recessive an unseen conscience to the people he serves. And Winfrey shines as an everywoman edgily content with her life -- one dictated by mid-20th century norms -- but knowing things must change. Oyelowo counters them with a fiery intensity and urgency. Robin Williams (as President Dwight Eisenhower) and Forest Whitaker in Lee Daniels The Butler (ANNE MARIE FOX) In the presidential parade Williams task is toughest he has to basically prep the audience for the coming Oval Office impersonations. His Ike makeup may distract but its a solid cameo. Marsden and Rickman fare best and Jane Fonda makes a winning Nancy Reagan. Cusack and Schreiber alas do ""SNL"" imitations at best (As for Ford and Carter running time dictates they simply appear in a time-lapse montage.) The power of ""The Butler"" though doesnt rest with them. Its in the way it personalizes a struggle younger viewers may only know from textbooks. The fight for equality the film shows was a daily challenge with deafening change sometimes happening in the quietest moments.

"Lee Daniels The Butler (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Lee Daniels The Butler (PG-13) This star-studded drama inspired by the life of a White House butler fares best when focusing on the Civil Rights movement. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com8/15/2013 Editor rating 2.5 Lee Daniels The Butler is creaky and sentimental and schmaltzy - devoid of the unhinged excesses that have become Daniels trademark (The Paperboy Precious Shadowboxer). The director is on his best behavior here because he knows hes making a prestigious picture and he plays to the back row too. The film is about as subtle as a piano falling on your head. But even though you may roll your eyes at the movie you cant dismiss it outright either. Inspired by a Washington Post article about Eugene Allen who was the White Houses head butler for 34 years the movie centers on Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) who grew up on a cotton plantation in 1926 where he learned the proper etiquette of the times on serving white people. After witnessing a tragedy he runs away and gets a series of jobs at luxury hotels marries the gregarious Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) and fathers two sons. His spotless record and experience land him a job interview at the White House in 1957 where hes hired as part of the kitchen staff and given stern instructions ""You hear nothing. You see nothing. You only serve."" Beautifully played with grace and restraint by Whitaker Cecil becomes a silent witness to history under eight administrations. He has at least one important encounter with each president Eisenhower (Robin Williams) who is dealing with the pushback to forced integration in Arkansas; Kennedy (James Marsden) and first lady Jacqueline (Minka Kelly) whom he helps console after the assassination of her husband; Johnson (Liev Schreiber) who asks Cecil for a glass of prune juice while sitting on the toilet; Nixon (John Cusack) who first appeals to Cecil while vice president in hopes of winning the black vote then later confides in him shortly before his resignation; and Reagan (Alan Rickman) who is torn about a push by Congress to approve an embargo on South Africa over their apartheid policies. Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter dont make the cut. Juxtaposed with Cecils experiences is the increasingly political life that his eldest son Louis (David Oyelowo) is leading joining the Freedom Riders attacked by the Ku Klux Klan participating in protest sit-ins and eventually becoming a militant Black Panther. When he visits his parents for dinner with his girlfriend (Yaya Alafia) and calls Sidney Poitier a ""rich Uncle Tom"" who acts white the unflappable Cecil loses his cool and kicks his son out of his home frustrated by Louis inability to understand the subtle strides that are being made towards racial equality. The films cast is huge including warm turns by Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz as Cecils fellow White House staffers and Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan who is the first person to recognize his years of duty and address him as a person instead of an employee. Winfrey leans on her own persona to make Gloria a vivacious likable woman but her irritation at her husbands constant absence due to his work duties and a potential affair with a neighbor (Terrence Howard) all feel like padding a way to turn her character into something other than the supportive wife. Even though every frame in the movie screams Oscar-bait the picture is never boring and its sweeping depiction of the Civil Rights movement albeit necessarily truncated keeps the narrative moving. Daniels only loses control near the end when some bone-headed decisions (including some unintentionally amusing track suits and unconvincing old-age makeup) rob the climax of its power. There are moments too when you can feel Daniels holding back and keeping himself in check because any trace of vulgarity or shock value (two of his favorite storytelling tools) would disrupt the films respectable veneer. Still when compared to something as patronizing and manipulative as Forrest Gump Lee Daniels The Butler comes off as an earnest crowd-pleaser with history on its side.

August 15 2013 -- 644pm Weinstein Co. Star Tribune FOREST WHITAKER stars in THE BUTLER Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Kristin Tillotson StribKristin ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" is ham-fisted overreaching melodramatic and despite its flaws worth the ride. For what it lacks in subtlety it compensates for with touching revelations about how generational differences in attitude divided black parents and children during the civil rights movement. A revolving door of Hollywood heavyweights helps out too. Inspired by the real-life story of a longtime White House butler the movie stars Oscar winner Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines a black man who escaped cotton fields to become a houseboy then hotel waiter and finally a member of the White House staff. He lives a peaceful middle-class life with his wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) and two sons until the older one Louis (David Oyelowo) becomes a Freedom Rider getting beat up at whites-only lunch counters traveling with the Rev. Martin Luther King and eventually joining the Black Panthers. Its the age-old dichotomy of patient maturity vs. impetuous youth played out against a backdrop of very real injustice. Cecil repeatedly asks with quiet dignity for raises that will put the black staff on a par with white and is always rebuffed. Louis gets angry when he sees his father drink from a ""coloreds only"" water fountain and sneers at Sidney Poitier whom he sees as an Uncle Tom. This is a sweeping epic that for a change portrays more than 50 tumultuous years of the 20th century from the points of view of African-Americans. For that reason alone it packs much more punch than the last big slice of Oscar bait we saw on the subject 2011s mawkish ""The Help"" made for a similar budget of about 25 million. Director Lee Daniels who rose to fame with the 2009 Oscar-winning drama ""Precious"" doesnt appear worried about whether hes chopped off too wide a slab of history. Rather he seems to say ""Maybe I did -- so what? Look here comes Cuba Gooding Jr. with a James Brown wig on."" Never one to shy away from showmanship Daniels lightens what could have been unrelentingly heavy slog with amusing touches such as using fashion to signal era -- heres Gloria and Cecil in matching 70s jumpsuits and whoops in no time there they are in 80s track suits. Feed Loader Robin Williams as Dwight Eisenhower (By the way its not Daniels ego that put his name rather awkwardly out front on the title. The Weinstein Co. lost a court fight to Warner Brothers whose own film ""The Butler"" came out way back in 1916.) Most of the films problems lie in the storytelling. So much exposition is crammed into the dialogue its amazing the actors can spit out all the words without rolling their eyes. Scene transitions feel like clicking through an old-fashioned View-Master abruptly moving from one 3-D slide to the next. Still the dynamic between Cecil and Louis propels the movie forward when an occasional lack of tension threatens to sink the action into inertia. Then theres Oprah who can no more masquerade as a lesser being than she can refrain from dispensing advice in real life. At least this time shes a smoking drinking ""Soul Train""-jammin sexpot of a wife who has an affair with a neighbor (Terrence Howard) in a brief detour thats irrelevant but for the fact we delight in seeing her behave badly. The movie wouldnt be half as much fun without her. When playing a U.S. president is it possible to come off as both high camp and seriously impressive? Exhibit A in descending order of brilliance Alan Rickman as Reagan is so well spackled coiffed and able to imitate that distinctive lilt that it takes a few seconds to place him. Liev Schreiber is LBJ sitting on the toilet with beagles at his feet Cecil standing by behind the half-open door with prune juice. Robin Williams is convincingly unsilly as Eisenhower. John Cusack has so much fun playing Nixon that he struggles to resist caricature before giving in to temptation. Finally James Marsden is utterly forgettable as JFK. But Jane Fonda in her fleeting seconds on screen as Nancy Reagan nails the iron authority under a demure exterior. ""The Butler"" has all the ingredients to conduct a ""for your consideration"" campaign come Oscar time -- its noble poignant historically important. It appears to have a lock on at least one award -- Best Makeup.

Photo Credit The Weinstein Company advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A black butler who serves the White House from the 1950s through the 80s bears witness to American history. Rated PG-13 (race-themed violence and language) BOTTOM LINE Strong work from the three stars as a family splintered by Civil Rights-era tensions but the film too often resorts to easy sentiment and simple caricatures. CAST Forest Whitaker David Oyelowo Oprah Winfrey LENGTH 212 Lets get the comparisons between ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" and Robert Zemeckis ""Forrest Gump"" out of the way. If you liked the 1994 film a nostalgic fantasy for baby boomers you will probably enjoy ""The Butler."" ""The Butler"" is not about a holy fool but a real person Eugene Allen a black Southerner who served -- literally -- in the White House from 1952 to 1986 a stretch marked by racial violence assassinations and the Vietnam War. The fictionalized Allen (he died in 2010) here named Cecil Gaines and played with vast inner strength by Forest Whitaker is a man who faces hard choices that never really troubled the white Forrest. That makes ""The Butler"" a more authentic-feeling film even if its Gumptious sentiment and pat storytelling undermine its good intentions.

Written by Danny Strong springboarding from a 2008 Washington Post profile on Allen ""The Butler"" finds its deepest truths in fiction. Cecils son David (an invented character played by a simmering David Oyelowo) is the opposite of his father -- a passionate participant in the Civil Rights era. Davids lunch-counter sit-ins contrasted with Cecils mannered table-setting for wealthy whites (the sharp editing is by Joe Klotz) can be electrifying and they provide thematic meat for the rest of the film. Director Lee Daniels (""Precious"") also visually highlights Cecils two Americas. The corridors of power are cool clean and symmetrical while the humble homes of Cecil and his co-workers (Lenny Kravitz and Cuba Gooding Jr. both sparkling) have a dingy-yellow warmth. Oprah Winfrey in her first major role in years as Gloria Cecils alcoholic wife brings focus to a somewhat blurry character. But the movie is marred by too many simplistic notions. The American presidents are mostly op-ed cartoons -- John Cusacks loutish Nixon Liev Schreibers hard-charging LBJ -- and they have an annoying habit of begging Cecil for major policy advice. One glaring omission is Jimmy Carter who as a white Southerner of roughly Cecils generation might have made for fascinating if fictional dialogue. (Perhaps Carter the films only living president that he served wasnt game for poetic license.) Barack Obama mentioned but not depicted provides the films thematic coda. 238 MoviesLee Daniels The Butler trailer ""The Butler"" is often so good and so powerful (Rodrigo Leaos aching score helps) that the pat moments feel even more disappointing.

Despite his name above the title of ""The Butler"" Lee Daniels is no Tyler Perry. The director of ""Precious"" is a provocateur not a pacifier. When the subject is Americas racial history its absolutely appropriate to stir the melting pot. So if whites like me are uncomfortable that an early scene of ""The Butler"" shows a stereotypical redneck raping a field hand shooting her husband and then telling the rest of the cotton pickers to get back to work thats the idea. And Daniels balances the scales of injustice with plenty of imperfect black characters too.But Forest Whitaker in the title role isnt one of them. As Cecil Gaines a fictionalized version of a man named Eugene Allen who worked as a servant in the White House from the 50s to the 80s he is well-behaved to a fault.Gaines the son of the laborers who are violated in the opening scene learns that he must be invisible to survive. A plantation owner (Vanessa Redgrave) teaches the fatherless boy to polish the silverware and serve the white folks which leads to a job at a fancy Washington hotel which in turn leads to the gig at the White House. Gaines condescending black supervisor tells him to hear nothing and say nothing because ""we have no room for politics at the White House."" Yet white politicians (such as Robin Williams as the kindly Dwight Eisenhower as John Cusack as the conspiratorial Richard Nixon) pretend to seek his input and the charming John F. Kennedy (James Marsden) actually shakes his hand.Kennedys Camelot is short-lived and during the bloody reign of the crude calculating Lyndon Johnson (Liev Schrieber) Gaines family life reflects the divisions in the country. Cecils wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey in a fearless de-glamorized return to acting) loses herself in alcohol while Cecils son Louis (David Oyelowo) finds himself in the civil-rights movement first as a pacifist Freedom Rider and then as a militant Black Panther. The forced mash-up of ""Forrest Gump"" and ""The Remains of the Day"" leaves a bit too much machine oil on the shag carpet but Whitaker is there to clean it up. His performance is impeccable. The over-sized Oscar winner for ""The Last King of Scotland"" literally seems to shrink into his role as a man who carries the weight of his race on his shoulders. Hes supported by a terrific cast that also includes Lenny Kravitz and Cuba Gooding Jr. as fierce and friendly co-workers respectively but the focus remains fixed on the star.

RELATED NEWS In The Butler history told through a black lens Beloved to Butler A look back at Oprahs acting career By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Aug 14 2013 326 PM ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" sneaks up on you. At first glance Daniels film about a White House butler (an outstanding Forest Whitaker) who serves eight U.S. presidents seems like a kind of civil-rights variation on ""Forrest Gump."" And theres some truth to that first impression and to the rather simplistic version of 20th-century history depicted here. But after a while the beauty of Whitakers understated performance starts to sink in. Its a balm to the cutting obscenities of stubborn racism and violence relived here whose vile legacy the film makes clear. The sheer pile-up of ugliness is heartbreaking; a few tears are likely to be shed before the film is over. Add another powerful performance by Oprah Winfrey so great in 1985s ""The Color Purple"" and equally good in a different way here and ""The Butler"" transcends its shortcomings. Whitaker plays Cecil Gaines a fictionalized (and renamed) version of a White House butler who did serve eight presidents. The movie version of his life covers the 20th century and early 21st. Born on a cotton plantation whose dangers he witnesses first hand Gaines escapes in part through the quiet help of the owner (Vanessa Redgrave) who after a tragedy puts him to work inside the house. She gives him advice both demeaning and useful when it comes to service The room should feel empty when youre in it. He works his way from a small hotel to a nicer place in Washington D.C. A White House aide overhears him giving a somewhat namby-pamby answer to a White customers question about the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education case in 1954 and Gaines soon is working for Dwight Eisenhower (Robin Williams the first in a line of big-name actors doing presidential cameos). He does his job well which is to say silently almost invisibly. Yet Gaines has a penchant for being in the room when presidents are making fateful decisions or at least thinking out loud about them. He works long hours extra hours at his home away from home. Its in his real home where things are more challenging. His wife Gloria (Winfrey) is a prideful alcoholic frustrated at being left alone most of the time raising her two sons alone. Their oldest son Louis (David Oyelowo) goes off to college and becomes first a member of the Freedom Riders then the Black Panthers giving us a rather convenient inside look at both movements. Gaines is appalled. His has been a life of subservience not activism which in turn humiliates Louis. Yet no less an authority than Martin Luther King Jr. (Nelsan Ellis) points out the hidden subversion in Gaines work. We see or hear about most of the watershed events of the civil-rights movement as Cecil works for Kennedy (James Marsden) Johnson (Liev Schreiber hilariously over the top and probably still not as profane as the real man) Nixon (John Cusack) and Reagan (Alan Rickman). Each president will struggle with civil-rights issues and each will come to know and confide in Gaines. These scenes are alternately interesting and amusing (as is the sight of Jane Fonda playing Nancy Reagan). But the movies heart lies in the Gaines home with Cecils relationship with Gloria. Whitaker and Winfrey have a wonderful chemistry. Theyre able to capture the struggles of a marriage that is battered by events and circumstances both within and out of their control. And Oyelowo gives as good as he gets as the headstrong Louis. The supporting cast includes Lenny Kravitz and Cuba Gooding Jr. as fellow butlers and Terrence Howard as a conniving neighbor. We get a welcome look inside Black homes of the 60s and 70s where we see love anger and everything else youd find anywhere else but also the pain of discrimination. People are people but Gaines his friends and family are forced to live their lives differently. The movie takes us to Barack Obamas election in 2008 by which time Gaines and his family will have changed considerably. Too conveniently? Perhaps. But by now were invested in them. Make no mistake Daniels is gunning for awards here; the movie has that sheen that Big Important Feel. But the performances keep it grounded. Let someone else decide winners and losers. Just enjoy ""The Butler"" for the sometimes-moving experience it is. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

Its 1968 and Martin Luther King Jr. (Nelsan Ellis) is discussing the Vietnam War with some of his closest aides and friends. ""How many of your parents support the war?"" he asks this group of African-American men. Almost all of them raise their hands. King then asks Louis Gaines (David Oyelowo) a young man sitting next to him what his father does for a living. ""My fathers a butler"" Louis says not without embarrassment. He doesnt tell King that his father Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) is a butler at the White House and was almost certainly in the room during Kings historic meeting with Lyndon B. Johnson in the Oval Office.Black domestic workers King tells Louis have played an important role in the struggle for civil rights. At first Louis assumes this is meant as mockery but King presses on. Maids butlers nannies and other domestics have defied racist stereotypes by being trustworthy hardworking and loyal King says; in maintaining other peoples households and raising other peoples children they have gradually broken down hardened and hateful attitudes. Their apparent subservience is also quietly subversive. This poignant and humbling recognition of the sacrifices made by millions of African-Americans who appeared to have no voice is an important turning point for Louis in his consideration of his fathers life but it also captures Kings extraordinary philosophical depth in a few moments. In case there isnt enough going on in that scene let us note that it takes place in the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Minutes or hours later the great civil rights leader will step outside onto the balcony and be shot dead.Id be hard-pressed to describe ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" as a good movie. Its programmatic didactic and shamelessly melodramatic. (Danny Strongs screenplay is best viewed as fictional although its loosely based on the true story of longtime White House butler Eugene Allen who died in 2010.) Characters constantly have expository conversations built around historical markers from the murder of Emmett Till to the Voting Rights Act. Every time Cecil serves coffee in the Oval Office he stumbles upon epoch-making moments Dwight Eisenhower (Robin Williams) debating whether to send federal troops to desegregate the schools in Little Rock; Richard Nixon (John Cusack) plotting a black entrepreneurship program to undercut the Black Panthers; or Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman) telling Republican senators he plans to defy Congress and veto sanctions against South Africa. Cecil and Louis the warring father and son played by Whitaker and Oyelowo might as well come with labels Cecil is following in the footsteps of Booker T. Washington; Louis in those of W.E.B. Du Bois.But ""The Butler"" is indisputably an important film and a necessary one arriving at the end of the summer of Paula Deen and George Zimmerman and the Detroit bankruptcy a summer that has vividly reminded us that if Americas ancient racial wounds have faded somewhat they have never healed. For a black filmmaker to tell this fraught and complicated story now in a mainstream picture with an all-star cast is significant all on its own. Faulkners observation that the past is never dead and isnt even past has come to sound trite through endless repetition by politicians and journalists but it speaks to our country in 2013 and to the impact of this movie. And before I wander too far afield ""The Butler"" is also a showcase for numerous terrific black actors including Whitaker Oyelowo Terrence Howard Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz not to mention a fiery and sure-to-be-Oscar-nominated supporting role for Oprah Winfrey as Cecils wife Gloria.For someone of my generation the civil rights movement may seem like an overly familiar pop-culture topic. But its been more than 20 years since ""Malcolm X"" ""Mississippi Burning"" and ""The Long Walk Home"" and closer to 40 years since groundbreaking TV specials like ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" or the miniseries ""King."" Much of the sweep of history in ""The Butler"" which begins in the Jim Crow Deep South of the 1920s and ends with a black man in the White House may seem like a dim black-and-white flicker to many younger Americans.Daniels previously the director of ""Precious"" and ""The Paperboy"" (forever famous as the movie in which Nicole Kidman pees all over Zac Efron) may not be a subtle storyteller but he delivers big emotional moments with considerable force. He makes the impact of the Kennedy and King assassinations seem real and present by focusing on individuals and details - Cecil trying to comfort a sobbing blood-spattered Jackie Kennedy (Minka Kelly) - and his re-creation of the Woolworth lunch counter sit-ins of 1960 or the Birmingham street scenes when dogs and fire hoses were turned on marchers possess a startling violence and freshness. In a time when a dominant current in American conservatism is dedicated to erasing both history and science to insisting that ""there are no lessons in the past"" its useful to be reminded how much about contemporary American life is shaped and conditioned by those events. You Might Also Like Daniels performs another public service by turning the well-meaning condescension of ""The Help"" upside down and telling the story of a black domestic worker and his family entirely from their point of view with minor supporting characters that include five United States presidents. (Cecil also served under Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter but theyre only seen in news footage.) The parade of famous white actors playing White House occupants is bizarre and almost arbitrary - Cusack looks nothing like Nixon although James Marsden is well cast as JFK and Liev Schreiber makes a surprisingly good Johnson - but thats a sideshow attraction. (Daniels understands precisely how hes twisting the knife with Jane Fondas cameo as Nancy Reagan by the way.) The main event is a terrific cast of African-American principals headlined by the immensely dignified performance of Whitaker playing a man who has raised himself by his own wits and almost Nietzschean willpower from the brutal cotton fields of Georgia to the corridors of power.As a boy Cecil witnesses his mother raped and his father murdered by a white overseer and thats the background his son - raised in the polite formal segregation of 1950s Washington - can never understand. Then the overseers guilt-ridden mother (Vanessa Redgrave) takes Cecil in and trains him as a ""house nigger"" a polite well-dressed automaton who is almost invisible and virtually silent. (I quote that offensive expression because its important and recurs several times.) The instruction delivered to Cecil over and over including at the White House is that he sees and hears nothing and that a room should feel empty when he is in it. Whatever Daniels flaws as a filmmaker may be in all his movies hes acutely sensitive to the possibilities of human communication even in impossible situations. Redgraves character clearly feels for Cecil and gives him what little she can; in her own way she too is a victim of the system that has destroyed his family.Over the years Cecil makes his way from Georgia to North Carolina to a luxury hotel in Washington and finally to the segregated service staff of the White House. (Implausibly enough it was Ronald Reagan a font of old-school racist policy and personal generosity who finally insisted on equal treatment for black employees.) He learns the intricacies of wine and whiskey builds up an autodidacts vocabulary and masters the fine art of being charming without appearing confrontational. Every black person in this line of work (Cecil observes in voice-over) has two faces of necessity - one for his white employers and clientele one for his family and friends. Whitaker plays Cecil as a man making a long lonely trek uphill with a heavy load on his back and the films other black characters all deal with life under a racist system in their own way. Cecils friend Howard (Terrence Howard) is a good-time Charlie and numbers runner; Cecils colleagues at the White House include foulmouthed ladies man Carter (Gooding) and educated upward-bound James (Kravitz). I suppose Winfrey is customarily too busy playing her own public persona to play dramatic roles but shes damn good at it; the proud angry boozing cheating and ultimately ferociously loyal Gloria has a vivid and very non-Oprah reality about her. If Daniels and screenwriter Danny Strong intend the tension between Cecils bootstraps assimilationism and Louis Freedom Rider-turned-Panther radicalism to be the movies central driving force it doesnt quite work. In a picture driven by a vibrant portrayal of African-American life and the visceral explosive force of history their opposed and intersecting character arcs feel overly constructed.Daniels point of course echoes what King tells Louis The traditions of Du Bois and Washington of self-sacrifice and hard work on one hand and street protest and political organizing on the other are not as distinct or disconnected as they may appear. Both have driven a history that isnt finished yet. While the election of Barack Obama serves as the culmination of this story -- and for African-Americans of Cecil Gaines generation it was an unimaginable even millennial victory - in the larger story of America it was an unexpected plot twist whose true consequences remain unknown. One hundred and fifty years ago Abraham Lincoln asked whether a country conceived in liberty and dedicated to equality would work out and we still dont know. ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" is big brave crude and contradictory very bad in places and very good in others and every American should see it. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Brutality and violence are the watchwords of the day from the farms overseer and within the first five minutes of the film were immersed into a time and place where African Americans are being deprived even the most basic human liberties. From here on out Cecil is ""saved"" from the fields more on that in a moment but by the time hes almost an adult he realizes the South is not a place he wants to be any longer. Mr. Gaines heads to Washington D.C. to seek work as a butler. Life as a domestic employee gives him a real chance at something resembling peace and stability and its only because he received training in a house during his youth that hes able find such work on a professional level. By the time Mr. Gaines reaches the White House hes in his early thirties and naturally hes as shocked as any of us would be to be thrust into the nations innermost circle the trappings of world power evident all around. Cecil (Forest Whitaker) starts his employment in the Eisenhower Administration in 1957 and its here the film will start the true journey showing us the juxtaposition of working with the most powerful man in the world all while you and your family were being exposed to disenfranchisement and Jim Crow laws. This dichotomy of course will lead to a massive sense of outrage and disbelief from any audience and many of the most poignant moments in ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" are culled from this fertile environment. Where ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" runs into  trouble is when it becomes apparent that there are either too many stories for the film to tell or perhaps a lack of awareness about which narrative to focus in on. There are times Cecil is an absentee father and his wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) becomes the true hero of the story working mightily to hold the family together. However alcoholism and infidelity are also hinted at for some reason though they dont seem at all relevant to the matters at hand. By the time of Cecils employment he and Gloria are the proud parents of two boys but Cecils chosen profession as a butler has him spending far more time at the White House than he does his own house. The movie makes it somewhat clear that working day in and out may hold some hope toward greater rights for all African Americans but it just as quickly pivots towards the idea that Cecils job is demeaning and ultimately counter-productive. Though the Civl Rights Movement was inherently complex and riddled with duality the missed opportunity of ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" was the chance to tie it all together for us. Unfortunately By choosing to make all the choices instead of more precise ones the movie renders itself somewhat muddled. You could also make the case that this movie is actually about the butlers son Lewis (David Oyelowo) and perhaps it should have been. Lewis represents the other side of striving for equality the people out on the streets purposefully provoking and exposing the absolute unfairness of the system that was in place. Lewis as a character has the most consistency but his relationship with his father is troubled which also drags down the film in places. Much as with last years ""Hyde Park on Hudson"" this is a film that gets confused as to how to play the huge societal issues being tackled while at the same time remaining intimate and focused on the humanity of those involved in affecting change. Where the film thrives is in avoiding most of the one-note villains most movies ascribe to. Indeed the involvement of the entire nation in The Civil Rights movement isnt shied away from or ignored much to the credit of the film for ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" is clearly aware that all pro-human change ultimately comes from within as people search their souls and conscious to stand up for whats right. Truly there are more good moments than bad throughout. Where ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" excels is in the single huge moments that etched into our national consciousness putting you front and center in the world-shaking events of the era. When firehoses are used on protesters when Freedom Riders speak truth to power when an entire race is discriminated against based on nothing more than tradition its here where ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" shows off the ability to evoke tears of empathy and disbelief. The world looks very different now for the better and clearly many of the people highlighted in the film played some small part in the sea change. All of the Presidents portrayed here are infused with little quirks that show off the oft-forgotten fact that they were simply men making decisions that had far-reaching consequences. Plus as the movie is also based on a true story its hard not to feel the real life impact of the tumultuous times. Still while ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" is full of truth and occasional cinematic beauty it is ultimately lesser for trying to tackle everything as opposed to the most important thing. The idea that ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" isnt really about Forest Whitakers take on Cecil Gaines may be historically accurate but unfortunately it never quite adds up to a coherent story. Perhaps its a reflection on how chaotic being on the front lines of huge societal shifts must have been but now 40 years later with some reflection we all would have been better off if a few doses of clarity entered the equation.

"The Butler an inspired history lesson with Oscar-possible acting review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Butler an inspired history lesson with Oscar-possible acting reviewLee Daniels The Butler never lets us forget the quest for wholeness at the heart of the story.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 15 2013Lee Daniels The ButlerStarring Forest Whitaker Oprah Winfrey David Oyelowo Terrence Howard Cuba Gooding Jr. Robin Williams John Cusack Alan Rickman James Marsden and Liev Schreiber. Directed by Lee Daniels. 132 minutes. Opens Aug. 23 at major theatres. 14ALee DanielsThe Butler serves up multiple stories of great moment and purpose over more than 80 years of U.S. ferment and theyre almost too much for one movie to bear. The film is the factually ""inspired"" account of one black butlers devotion to eight U.S. presidents in the aptly named White House.Article Continued BelowIts an emotional father/son love story across multiple decades.Oprah Winfrey and Forest Whitaker costar in Lee Daniels The Butler.The Butler is also a sweeping history of the American civil rights movement from the cotton-field slavery of the 1920s through the social unrest of the 1960s and up to the 2008 election of Barack Obama as the first African-American U.S. president.To pack all this and more into a two-hour movie seems like madness especially considering that title character Cecil Gaines (played by Forest Whitaker and loosely based on real White House butler Eugene Allen) is required to keep his emotions bottled up for most of the film. Its a bravura feat that is almost entirely interior a marvel of containment but we can always intuit what hes thinking.Cecils job serving Americas top leader requires absolute focus and discretion ""You hear nothing you say nothing. You only serve"" hes told on Day 1 of his White House assignment.Thats tough to illustrate much less make dramatic but Daniels (Precious The Paperboy) has never been one to shirk from a challenge. And this one comes with the Oscar catnip of not only Whitakers shining performance but also strong turns by Oprah Winfrey (as Cecils alcoholic wife Gloria) and David Oyelowo (as Cecils righteous and rebellious son Louis).The movie opens in current times with a 90-year-old Cecil staring at a portrait of George Washington as he awaits a White House meeting that will symbolize his lifes work and dreams. Daniels and screenwriter Danny Strong (Game Change) soon flash us back to Cecils younger days as a cotton picker in Macon Ga. where he witnesses horrific brutality to his family at the hands of a racist white sharecropper. A plantation elder (Vanessa Redgrave) takes pity on young Cecil and in a gesture considered kindly for the era she promises to train him to be a ""house n---er"" so he can escape violence.Some 31 years and a mentor or two later Cecil finds himself with a wife and two young sons and a new job as butler to President Dwight D. Eisenhower (Robin Williams) at the start of Ikes second term of office. The clock seems to tick faster as Cecil gets to know the White House backstage routines with the kibitzing help of a cook and a fellow butler played by Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz respectively. Hes obliged to keep up with changing administrations from Republican to Democratic and back again as Eisenhower is followed by John F. Kennedy (James Marsden) Lyndon B. Johnson (Liev Schreiber) Richard Nixon (John Cusack) and later Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman). A few presidents are skipped wisely avoiding a numbing countdown and allowing us to savour presidential turns that sometimes yield to caricature but are never less than entertaining. Some are even revealing as is the case with Rickmans multi-layered Reagan.Outside of the dignified calm of the White House theres a riot goin on with racially charged civil rights confrontations that involve Cecils headstrong son Louis who is determined to participate in every protest going from diner sit-ins to Freedom Rides to Black Panther fist-waving.The life roles of Cecil and Louis couldnt be different something Daniels underscores by cutting between scenes of the father sedately serving toffs while the son is noisily assaulted by racist yokels.The tension between a father espousing devotion and dignity and a son demanding justice helps maintain continuity in The Butler as does another subplot involving Glorias depression and her illicit interest in a neighbour (Terrence Howard). Love bonds are really put to the test in the film.Daniels isnt the most subtle of directors but hes an arresting one. His casting choices are frequently inspired and he can be surprisingly conservative. The soundtrack for example has more classical music in it than it does rock soul and Ramp;B.""We got two faces ours and the ones weve got to show white people"" Cecil says in The Butler giving voice to Americas unjust racial divide. The film covers a lot of ground with many players sometimes risking collapse but it never lets us forget the quest for wholeness at the heart of the story.Read more about Barack ObamaThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Lee Daniels The Butler is inspired by the life of Eugene Allen who served eight presidents during a period (1952--1986) that coincided with seismic changes in African-American life. The films source a Washington Post article that ran shortly after Obamas election includes both a history of blacks in presidential administrations and Allens memories of various commanders in chief. Daniels working from a screenplay by Danny Strong (Recount Game Change) paints in broader strokes using the story as a springboard for a veritable greatest-hits of the civil rights movement. Forest Whitaker plays the fictionalized butler (renamed Cecil Gaines) who as a boy in 1926 sees his father shot on a Georgia plantation. The murderous landowners train him to be a house servant. A job at a hotel eventually leads to work at the White House where Cecil witnesses everything from Eisenhowers role in the desegregation of Little Rock schools to Reagans reluctance to impose sanctions on apartheid-era South Africa. At the same time his son (David Oyelowo) goes from being a Freedom Rider to a Black Panther to a congressman from Tennessee. As history The Butlers parade of famous moments and figures is superficial to the point of trivialization reducing years of turmoil to glib sound bites. But in its square melodramatic way the movie has a serious point to make Like Tanya Hamiltons much-superior Night Catches Us it argues that change often comes about through multiple channels--some revolutionary others less so. (The film unnecessarily hammers home this idea by having no less than Martin Luther King Jr. played by Nelsan Ellis inform Oyelowo that his father has played a quietly important role in history.) Chronicling six decades the movie captures changing attitudes toward protest. While the contrast between scenes of family life and major events can be mortifyingly on-the-nose (""I dont care about what goes on in that house"" Oprah Winfrey as Whitakers wife snaps after the Kennedy assassination. ""I care about what goes on in this house"") cringeworthy passages alternate with powerful interludes as when the sons sit-in at a segregated lunch counter is crosscut with Whitaker helping to set the table at the White House. By having Nicole Kidman void herself on Zac Efron in The Paperboy Daniels opened himself to a lot of bad jokes but The Butler is a vastly more conventional and watchable film worth taking on its own terms. As a director Daniels remains maddeningly erratic; like Precious The Butler has a tendency to undermine its material with caricature and the presidential casting here is a particular embarrassment. Who wouldnt think of Robin Williams as Eisenhower John Cusack as Nixon or Alan Rickman as Reagan? (Ford and Carter are passed over in a montage; maybe De Niro wasnt available.) And just because LBJ (Liev Schreiber) was known for intimidating aides by inviting them to watch him defecate doesnt mean his constipated nattering meshes with this films tone. Clearly theres something of The Paperboys bathroom obsession in The Butler. But mostly the movie is a straightforward soap opera--sentimental reductive and in spite of itself satisfying.

Moviegoers it seems need to be cool not too moved not too surprised not too impressed. We wouldnt want to be taken in would we? We know weve seen it all before--even when we havent.We havent seen a movie like Lee Danielss The Butler. The world of mainstream film wasnt teeming with multigenerational sagas set against the backdrop of the civil rights movement nor is it rife with movies in which all the white actors--big ones--appear only in supporting roles.The Butler--a sort of mini-history of late 20th-century black America as seen through the eyes of one longtime White House domestic worker played by Forest Whitaker--is blunt where it needs to be. Sometimes its too didactic or sentimental. But unlike Danielss previous pictures Precious and The Paperboy it doesnt pretend to audacious storytelling. Daniels is that rare contemporary filmmaker whos not afraid of melodrama. The Butler is so old-school it feels modern Stylistically it could have been made 30 years ago but its time is now.Film Details Lee Daniels The Butler RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time132 More Info Trailer The Butler opens inauspiciously with stiff voiceover Whitakers character Cecil Gaines tells the story of his childhood picking cotton in 1920s Georgia. Cecil learns early on that hes at the mercy of the white folk for whom he and his parents work. The plantation owners son (a sociopath played by Alex Pettyfer) first rapes Cecils mother (Mariah Carey) and then murders his father (David Banner). As a grudging act of recompense--youd hardly call it kindness--the family matriarch (played unflinchingly by Vanessa Redgrave) invites Cecil into the big house to train as a domestic servant though thats not the phrase she actually uses.The invitation changes Cecils life. He learns good manners and discretion qualities that serve him well when he eventually becomes a waiter at a swanky hotel (Clarence Williams III is the supervisor who gives him his big break) and later earns a slot as a butler at the White House where he serves under eight presidents beginning with Robin Williamss Dwight D. Eisenhower. (Others are played by James Marsden Liev Schreiber John Cusack and Alan Rickman all impeccably cast; Schreibers LBJ is particularly robust barking orders from the toilet seat as his beagles flop around him like tired minions.)The Butler isadapted from a 2008 Washington Post article by Wil Haygood detailing the story of real-life White House butler Eugene Allen. (The movies official title changed at the last minute as the result of a lawsuit instigated by Warner Bros.--which released a short called The Butler in 1916--is Lee Daniels The Butler though no normal person is going to call it that.) Danny Strong writer of HBOs Game Change fleshed out the story and enlarged its scope.Cecil is happy enough in his line of work which allows him to ably support his kids and his wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey). But his elder son Louis (David Oyelowo) chafes under the status quo; he first becomes one of the Freedom Riders and later joins the Black Panthers. You could call that a basic generation-gap screenwriting contrivance or you could call it a smart way to dramatize the turmoil and necessary change brought about by the civil rights movement. Its both Cecil may yearn for white peoples respect but his children understandably want to push for more.In Precious the characters were walking symbols for the worst horrors of inner-city life. The Butler puts its characters first. Daniels re-creates some of the most potent and horrific images of the civil rights era including those of young black protesters being blasted with firehoses. But his approach is for the most part more personal than instructional. You can see where everyones coming from in The Butler why some characters are afraid to ask for more while others dare to demand it.Danielss history lesson isnt always graceful. At times The Butler suggests far too optimistically that the presence of servants of color in the White House actually helped shape policy and sometimes characters declaim rather than speak. In a recent Parade interview he explains that when he showed the movie to his family his 30-year-old nephew asked him ""Did some of this stuff really happen?"" a question Daniels found distressing. In the same interview Winfrey asked if young people today know enough about the civil rights movement was even blunter ""They dont know diddly-squat. Diddly-squat""Then again one persons history lecture is anothers common sense and straight talk. When Cecil says in voiceover ""Any white man can kill any of us at any time and not be punished for it"" its impossible not to think of Florida today.Theres something else going on here too. There are more terrific black actors in Hollywood than there are good roles they might actually land. The Butler creates an open freeing space for lots of these performers. Cuba Gooding Jr. Terrence Howard Lenny Kravitz Yaya Alafia Everybodys good. Whitaker is one of those observant understated performers who says everything between the lines. His Cecil has spent a lifetime being deferential to white people but as one character cannily points out subservience can be quietly subversive.Winfrey may be the finest of all. Youd think she might turn Gloria into a snoozy role model. Gloria is flawed (she drinks) but Winfrey knows when to go for laughs too--she takes the role seriously without making it self-serious. One of Glorias big dreams is to visit the White House but she has to wait a long time for it to happen. (Mrs. Reagan--played like a tiny powerhouse by Jane Fonda--is the first First Lady to extend the invitation.) Thats part of the reason Gloria resents her husbands dedication to his job and to his presidents particularly the kindly anxiety-ridden JFK.One night after she and Cecil have been arguing Gloria rouses herself from bed--shes just a little bit sozzled--and goes over to her vanity mirror where she applies a coat of lipstick as meticulously as only a truly angry woman can. She taunts her husband ""I bet you wish I spoke French just like Jack-ay."" Theres bitterness in that moment but Winfrey also makes it funny. This is the opposite of great-lady acting--its something much better more vibrant and alive and whatever The Butlers flaws may be Winfreys off-the-cuff fortitude is emblematic of its spirit. Daniels has made a proper movie with all the conventionality that implies yet its progressive in its heart. Sometimes the best way to fight the power is to bend it to your will.Subscribe to the Voice Film Club podcastFollow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Daily Edition Login to download Lee Daniels The Butler Film Review 901 AM PDT 8/9/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A schematic but emotionally effective survey of the civil rights movement from the unique perspective of a White House butler. TWITTER Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey lead a star-studded cast of The Weinstein Company drama that tells the story of the civil rights movement from the point of view of a White House butler. Inspiring if not inspired Lee Daniels The Butler is a sort of Readers Digest overview of the 20th century American civil rights movement centered on an ordinary individual with an extraordinary perspective. This fictionalized account of a Southern black man who worked as a White House butler under seven presidents from Eisenhower to Reagan is a very middle-of-the-road movie politically and aesthetically with myriad issues to carp about. But the long arc of this mans story which begins in a Georgia cotton field and ends with an invitation back to his longtime work place to meet the first black president of the United States describes a personal racial and national journey in a way that is quite moving and will have a powerful effect on all manner of audiences with the presumed exception of highbrows and real leftists. The films costar Oprah Winfrey will personally see to it that masses of people are mobilized to turn out older viewers will welcome something to see other than sci-fi and comics-derived extravaganzas and The Weinstein Companys decision to bypass the early fall festivals to seize the same August release slot The Help occupied two summers ago will likely prove to be a shrewd one. For Winfrey the film marks a return to acting for the first time since Beloved in 1998; for Daniels who ironically got his name added to the title just last month due to a dispute with Warner Bros. even though he was a latecomer to the project this represents respectable material diametrically opposed to his deliberately trashy and inflammatory last outing The Paperboy and for producers its a field day as 37 individuals are listed on the credits with the word ""producer"" attached to their names in some form surely a record. Deserving special mention among them however is Laura Ziskin whose final passion project this was before her death. PHOTOS Lee Daniels The Butler Premiere Oprah Forest Whitaker and Anna Wintour Walk the Red Carpet in NY Long-retired White House maitre dhotel Eugene Allen was a figure unknown to the public until Nov. 7 2008 three days after Barack Obamas election as president when Wil Haygoods article about his unusual life appeared in The Washington Post. To eliminate dramatic constraints and in at least a couple of unfortunate ways to build up cheap melodrama the script by Danny Strong (the estimable Recount and Game Change) fictionalizes the leading character by renaming him Cecil Gaines who is eloquently played by Forest Whitaker as a picture of modesty and rectitude an unchanging human bastion of calm and reliability in a 20th century world that is anything but. While some modern black viewers may join the Cecils more radical son in objecting to the ennobling of an old-fashioned get-along sort of man more than a few whites might blanch at the manipulative melodrama of the opening scene which evidently bears no relation to Allens actual life. As if in a particularly lurid passage from Mandingo the mad-eyed young heir (Alex Pettyfer) to a Georgia cotton farm circa 1926 drags young Cecils mother (Mariah Carey) out of the field to rape her then shoots his father dead when the man protests. Theres no legal recourse but the miscreants old mother (Vanessa Redgrave) unwittingly sets the grieving boy on his career course by making him the house you-know-what. The caricaturing here is extreme and creates immediate worries about whats to come. As a young man Cecil gets waiter and bartender jobs at increasingly exclusive whites-only venues marries Gloria (Winfrey) who bears two sons and upon applying for a White House kitchen job in 1957 is immediately asked by the reigning maitre d (an excellent Colman Domingo) ""Are you political?"" Its clear that if he were to give the wrong answer the interview would go no further. Once he wins the coveted job -- vacancies on the traditionally all-black staff occur very infrequently -- hes sworn to secrecy and is advised that ""You hear nothing you see nothing. You only serve."" VIDEO Lee Daniels The Butler Trailer As it happens President Eisenhower (Robin Williams) is just then dealing with the deeply divisive issue of forced integration of schools in Arkansas. While painting one day Ike tries to draw the reluctant Cecil out on the subject and when the president sends in army troops in enforce the court order Cecil returns home to admiringly remark that this is ""the first time I ever saw a president stick his neck out for us."" And so begins the march of history through the eyes of a man whose job makes him a largely silent witness to select slivvers of high-level crises decision-making and tragedy. Not nearly as personable as his boss Vice President Nixon (John Cusack) shows up in the kitchen with some campaign pins to awkwardly court the helps votes; Cecil attempts to read Madeline to little Caroline Kennedy who would rather know who the Freedom Riders are (Cecils older son Louis is one) then tends to Jackie when she arrives at the White House from Dallas still wearing the blood-stained pink outfit; LBJ (Liev Schreiber) calls a meeting of staffers while taking a dump; Cecil overhears Nixon now president voicing his desire to co-op the Black Panthers which the increasingly radical Louis has now joined and some years later is asked by the Watergate-beclouded chief executive to sit with him for some drunken late-night commiseration. With her husband constantly on call and so devoted to his work Gloria has too much time on her hands; her turning to drink and extra-marital temptations are lightly sketched in. The contrast between the couples two sons could not be more blatantly schematic however. Louis (David Oyelowo) under the influence of his foxy girlfriend Carol (Yaya Alafia the co-star of Mother of George under the name Yaya DaCosta) becomes increasingly radicalized arguing with his parents (""Sidney Poitier is nothing but a rich Uncle Tom"" he rants about their favorite actor) and adding insult to injury when he refuses to attend the funeral of his younger brother Charlie (Elijah Kelley) who enthusiastically enlists in the army only to be killed in Nam. Martin Luther King passes through the 70s bring the mainstreaming of black culture via clips from Soul Train and Sanford amp; Son Louis abandons extremism to run for Congress and by the time Gloria finally gets her wish to set foot in the White House after all the years when the Reagans (Alan Rickman and Jane Fonda) invite the Gaineses to be their guests at a state dinner (Cecil being waited on by his old pals offers frissons both awkward and amusing) the venerable couple seem to have drawn closer and reached a loving mutual accommodation. (Presidents Ford and Carter are blithely skipped over in this telling.) And yet even with all contrivances and obvious point-making and familiar historical signposting Daniels The Butler is always engaging often entertaining and certainly never dull the latter a fault for which neither the director nor the writer thus far in their careers can ever be accused. Each scene has its purpose and complimentary energy the actors all seem unified in a joint cause and the angle from which the historical panorama is presented remains sufficiently unusual to sustain rapt attention. This is not an artful tidy or sophisticated film but its subject and his stationary odyssey are of such a singular nature that as a great playwright once wrote attention must be paid to such a person. Aging realistically as a years flip by Whitaker remains locked within a narrow range due to his characters requisite discretion but creates a finely tuned portrait of a man for whom patience fortitude and playing by the rules are paramount virtues; by the end it emerges as a genuinely stirring performance. With her drunk scenes and sporadic venting of frustrations Winfrey has more dramatic opportunities and is quite enjoyable to watch her enormous wealth and status since her last movie outing having encumbered her with no noticeable grande dame affectations. Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz have their moments as fellow longtime butlers with Cecil while Terrence Howard a front tooth missing lounges around as a neighborhood layabout. As for the celebrity casting for White House occupants no matter how outrageous or physically inexact each instance of it may seem you just sort of roll with it. One probably wouldnt want to see any of these fine actors play these presidents for two hours but for the brief moments when theyre on theyre at least game and amusing; by the time youve tried to make an initial mental adjustment and begun assessing whats ludicrously wrong and sometimes vaguely right about any of them theyre gone and its on to the next match-up. Perhaps surprisingly -- and most jarringly given real-life politics -- the best cameo of this nature comes from Jane Fonda who is very good indeed as a gracious Nancy Reagan. The unusual choice of Portuguese composer Rodrigo Leao has paid off in a flavorsome non-cookie cutter score thats abetted by a raft of pop tunes that helps identify the quickly passing time periods.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Invasion of the Pub Crawlers The Worlds End is the years most entertaining movie. By David Edelstein Published Aug 11 2013 ShareThis (Photo Laurie Sparham/Courtesy of Focus Features) The title The Worlds End denotes two things the terrible horrible demise of humankind and the English suburban pub where a man named Gary (Simon Pegg) plans to conclude a twelve-pub (one pint per establishment) odyssey in triumph. The aim is to go back to his hometown of Newton Haven and commemorate a similar aborted trek that happened twenty-odd years ago when Gary and four mates were boisterous punks on the brink of manhood. The othersAndy (Nick Frost) Steven (Paddy Considine) Oliver (Martin Freeman) and Peter (Eddie Marsan)have careers and families but for Gary the manhood thing hasnt quite worked out. Drinking his way to the Worlds End will be his revolt against time and soul-draining conformity a ringing declaration of existential freedomthough somewhat undermined by his childlike self-centeredness and raging alcoholism. Gary would be a pathetic figurea doomed con man in the age of Eugene ONeill AA-bound in our therapeutic eraif The Worlds End were directed by anyone other than Edgar Wright. For Wright Gary is a peculiar combination of right and wrong. Mostly wrong but tilting toward wrightnessI mean rightnessinsofar as he susses out sinister changes in old Newton Haven. Hes a funny combination of wanker and warrior. Uproarious in fact. The Worlds End is the third of Wrights genre-bending black comedies starring Pegg (who co-wrote it) and Frost and its arguably the bestalthough who would want to argue over three such beautifully constructed social satires? In this one Wright and Pegg take a mere half-hour to distill an entire subgenre of American child-man comedies. Gary must persuade his four sedentary pals to join him the most formidable challenge being Frosts Andy who hasnt spoken to him (or had a drink) in years and for very good reason. Gary succeedshe has to or thered be no moviebut its touchy. Striding into their first pub Gary (in a long Matrix-style coat) and his mates anticipate a returning heroes welcome. They find instead that most of the watering holes have been taken over by corporations serving fake real ale and taste-alike lagers. The food the dartboard the music interchangeable. The publicans grim. Still they drink up. Olivers sister arrives in the startlingly pretty person of Rosamund Pike to inject a note of disapproval her most incinerating stares reserved for Gary who done her wrong the last time around. Then something extraordinary happens. How extraordinary? Let me tell you. Or not. My press kit came with a note asking journalists not to reveal the films twists or even some of its guest stars. Ordinarily such warnings raise my anti-authoritarian hackles but the note is signed by Wright himself and written in the spirit of Be a mate okay? If my colleagues disregard Wrights plea and invoke certain classic sci-fi books and films you must bombard their comment sections with abuse. I can talk about Wright and Peggs previous collaborations. Shaun of the Dead was a slapstick riff on George Romeros cannibal-zombie pictures (before zombies were a dime a hundred) but the real target was a certain species of middle-class English complacency and its attendant good manners. The heroes of the mismatched buddy-cop film Hot Fuzz paid tribute to such forerunners as Bad Boys 2 and Point Break while taking on not scum-sucking drug dealers but vicars innkeepers and old ladies. The fascists were the guardians of quaintness. Wright is an even better director now and the last half-hour of The Worlds End is one bravura set piece after another. The action is brilliantly staged and shot the climax evoking (and equaling) the dizzying nightclub opening of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The all-star cast is perfection. As for what it all means One of the creepier figures (a star cameo) reminded me of Trotsky so perhaps theres an anti-communist component to counter the anti-fascist leanings of Hot Fuzz. Its anti-totalitarian any way you slice it. More important Wright and Pegg figure out a way to let their hero renounce his drink and have it too. Their vision is both antic and judicious. This is by light-years the most entertaining movie of the year. How many apocalyptic sci-fi action extravaganzas leave you feeling as if the world is just beginning? Lee Daniels The Butler is crudely powerful. You can object to the thuggish direction and the script thats a series of signposts but not the central idea which is genuinely illuminating. An elderly black man Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) sits in the White House and rethinks his life the murder of his cotton-picking father who dared to glower at a white master whod molested Cecils mother; his training as a house n----- by a plantation matriarch (Vanessa Redgrave); and his subsequent education as a waiter and then butler in the (white) halls of power. Cecil learns to have two faces one he shows to his own people one blankly subservient. While presidents like Eisenhower Kennedy and LBJ grapple with civil rights for African-Americans Cecil holds his tongueall while his son Louis (David Oyelowo) is beaten to a pulp for sitting with fellow activists at a whites-only lunch counter. In one elaborate sequence Daniels crosscuts between the exquisite obeisance of the father at a state dinner and the bloody assault on the son who goes on to be a Freedom Rider and a Black Panther. Over and over Daniels wallops youbut the meaning of what hes showing isnt as obvious as it first appears. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Photo AP ""Lee Daniels The Butler is a star-filled if heavy-handed labor of love that certainly has its heart in the right place and scores dramatically often enough to recommend it. Forest Whitaker -- an Oscar winner as Idi Amin in ""The Last King of Scotland"" -- is superlative as a White House butler who serves under seven presidents. There are some really powerful moments depicting the civil rights struggle a fairly rare subject for American movies these days. I wish I didnt have some reservations about it but I do. Whitaker is wonderfully subtle in suggesting the inner turmoil of a character whose job mandates subservience. Although director Lee Daniels dials things down a bit here subtlety is not what he does. That strategy worked for ""Precious but turned his more recent ""The Paperboy into a feature-length howler. HOW ""LEE DANIELS THE BUTLER"" TURNED ACTORS INTO PRESIDENTIAL DEAD RINGERS I also had some qualms about the contrivances and manipulations that abound in Danny Strongs screenplay which turns a real-life White House butler named Eugene Allen into the fictional composite Cecil Gaines whose family is repeatedly thrust into key historical moments a la ""Forrest Gump."" ""The Butler does not begin particularly promisingly. Waiting for an audience with President Obama (who is not depicted) the elderly Cecil flashes back to a 1926 Georgia cotton farm where we see his father shot to death by the owners son who has taken liberties with his mother (Mariah Carey who leads a parade of celebrity cameos with a nonspeaking role). Jackie Kennedy (Minka Kelly) President Kennedy (James Marsden) and daughter Caroline (Chloe Barach) greet the White House staff. (AP) The more compassionate owner (Vanessa Redgrave) selects young Cecil for training as a house servant. Cecil becomes so skilled at unobtrusively serving white folk that as an adult his boss at a Virginia hotel (Clarence Williams III) recommends him for an important plum in Washington. Colman Domingo is very good as the maitre d supervising the (underpaid) all-black domestic staff who lays down strict rules for Cecil ""There is no room for politics in the White House and ""You hear nothing you see nothing. What we see though is a parade of famous and semi-famous actors made up to play presidents beginning with Robin Williams whose Eisenhower is around just long enough for Cecil to express amazement that Ike has ordered out troops to back up court-ordered school integration. Unsurprisingly much more time is devoted to deifying John F. Kennedy (a curiously cast James Marsden) and his widow Jackie who returns from her husbands Dallas assassination in November 1963 and shows off her blood-strained dress to the stunned Cecil who then reads a bedtime story to soothe Caroline Kennedy. It might have been fun to have Cecil sneaking Marilyn Monroe into the White House but you wont see that -- or an unflattering story that his real-life model Allen told about watching JFK wince when black celebrity Sammy Davis Jr. arrived for a reception with his white wife. By this point Cecils older son Louis (an excellent David Oyelowo) has chosen to embrace political activism as a member of the Freedom Riders who risked (and sometime lost) their lives while confronting racism in the South head-on. RELATED HOW ""LEE DANIELS THE BUTLER"" TURNED ACTORS INTO PRESIDENTIAL DEAD RINGERS Daniels boldly cuts between Cecil carrying out his duties at White House state dinners with very well-staged scenes of Lou participating in lunch counter sit-ins and more horrifyingly traveling on a Freedom Riders bus firebombed by the Ku Klux Klan. These scenes are a valuable reminder of a time in fairly recent history that many younger American are only vaguely aware of if at all. More dubious is the film reducing American presidents to crude caricatures -- Lyndon Johnson (a terrible Liev Schreiber) talks about his landmark civil rights legislation while sitting on a toilet and dropping the N-word with Cecil standing dutifully at his side. Though John Cusack makes an amusing Richard Nixon -- first seen electioneering the staff (including turns by Cuba Gooding Jr. primarily providing comic relief and Lenny Kravitz) in the kitchen as vice president -- basically his term is reduced to a drunk and paranoid Tricky Dick assuring the ubiquitous Cecil that he will ""never"" resign over Watergate. The films dramatic thrust is the growing rift between the apolitical Cecil and son Louis who is conveniently on hand in Memphis when Martin Luther King Jr. is assassinated (just after patiently lecturing Louis that servants like Cecil can be subversive). Cecil briefly gets caught up in the riots that follow but father and son become estranged when Louis -- who has come to regard the old man as something of an Uncle Tom -- joins the more radical Black Panthers. After skipping over the administrations of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter the films final stretch contains Jane Fondas much-anticipated appearance as first lady Nancy Reagan. What amounts to a glorified cameo runs for a couple of brief scenes that are highly sympathetic as Nancy invites a stunned Cecil and his wife as guests to a state dinner. Far less flattering is the depiction of her husband who has far more screen time as Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman fresh from a Madame Tussauds makeover). Though he worries to Cecil that he ""may be on the wrong side of the race issue Reagan decides to veto congressional trade sanctions against the racist apartheid government of South Africa. The disgusted Cecil decides to retire and join Louis outside the South African embassy for a protest that lands both of them in jail -- a change of heart that the story in no way prepares us for. Oprah Winfrey gets second billing for relatively few scenes as Cecils long-suffering wife who between worrying about Louis being killed or arrested and her husbands long hours of work starts hitting the bottle. She also has an affair with a hunky neighbor played by Terrence Howard. Winfrey -- who hasnt acted on the big screen in 15 years -- has been encouraged by Daniels to do some serious chewing that borders on cringe-inducing. Rather than seeming to be in the same movie as the dignified Whitaker its more like shes doing Elizabeth Taylors role in ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? The wife passes away just before Obamas election which the film none-too-subtly couches as the second coming of JFK. ""The Butler is a mixed bag that often tries way too hard to wring tears and shock from the audience. But when it comes to underserved subject matter like this you have to give props even for a flawed attempt like this.

(His tenure during which he served presidents from Harry Truman to Ronald Reagan was chronicled in a 2008 Washington Post article.) In Lee Daniels The Butler--the awkward title isnt a John Carpenter-esque possessive but a legal requirement after a copyright claim--Allens fictionalized surrogate is Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) who leaves his tragedy-laden Southern life behind to start anew in our nations capital. Much to the delight of his wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) and the chagrin of his burgeoning-activist son Louis (David Oyelowo) Cecils attentiveness to the needs of the civic elite earns him a job at the presidential manse. Its there that he spends several epochal decades observing as people of power deal with questions of war abroad and civil rights at home. Viewers familiar with Danielss idiosyncratically vulgar work might be disappointed that theres little here that compares to Nicole Kidman loosing a yellow stream on Zac Efrons jellyfish stings in The Paperboy (2012). But look beyond The Butlers dewy-eyed seemingly Wikipedia-sourced trappings (as in the HBO movies Recount and Game Change screenwriter Danny Strong treats history like the ultimate ""then this happened"" checklist) and youll see Daniels hasnt gone Oscar-bait-crazy. At its most daring the film acts as a subtly incendiary corrective to Hollywoods subservient treatment of blacks staging scenes that youd expect to see in any number of end-of-year historical biopics complete with a celebrity whos who--Robin Williams John Cusack Alan Rickman--as the leaders of the free world except the focus is almost entirely on Cecil. (Whitaker truly makes the most of what could have been a one-note role conveying every one of his characters complicated emotions even when attempting by orders to go entirely unnoticed.) This dismantling of a story from within manages to be both enthrallingly meta and movingly sincere. Its of much more interest than the approximately equal number of sequences most of them having to do with Louiss activities on the Martin Luther King and Black Panther-led front lines where Daniels succumbs to narrative expectations in the pursuit of an alterna-world Forrest Gump to call his own.

The director of ""Precious"" and ""The Paperboy"" plays things relatively straight in ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" a sprawling highly fictional biopic of longtime White House butler Eugene Allen that also positions itself as a panoramic snapshot of the African-American experience across nine decades. But if Daniels has tamped down the kinky sexuality and outre stylistic flourishes for his first PG-13 outing his handprints can still be found in the films volatile mix of acting styles gratuitous sentimentality cut with moments of real emotional power and a tone that seesaws between serious social melodrama and outsized chitlin-circuit theatrical. At its root the kind of starry old-fashioned prestige pic the studios used to make this stealthy late-summer release from the Weinstein Co. (smartly moved up from its original fall date) stands to make a modest killing with oxygen-deprived adult moviegoers whom the pic will have pretty much to itself between now and the start of awards season.This story first appeared in the August 13 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. First reported in a 2008 Washington Post article by Wil Haygood the story of Allen -- who served as a White House butler under eight administrations eventually achieving the position of maitre d -- is the stuff that many a producers Oscar dreams are made of. So much so that its shocking it took years and more than 40 credited producers of varying kinds to actually get it to the screen. Its history as seen through the eyes of the humble envoy to the great men of his time a black ""The Kings Speech"" or ""The Remains of the Day."" (Daniels himself has likened the film to ""Forrest Gump"" a comparison that holds for both good and ill.) And if the real life of your protagonist isnt inherently dramatic enough ... well thats what Hollywood screenwriters are for. So Daniels and writer Danny Strong (a Beltway specialist whose credits include ""Recount"" and ""Game Change"") transform Allen into the fictionalized Cecil Gaines whose life begins inauspiciously on a Georgia cotton plantation in the 1920s where he witnesses both of his sharecropper parents (David Banner and Mariah Carey) brutalized by the snarling white boss man (Alex Pettyfer in one of the pics more thankless roles). Shown pity by the elderly matriarch (Vanessa Redgrave) the boy Cecil (Michael Rainey Jr.) is made a ""house nigger"" and trained in the ways of serving whites that will benefit him over the course of his career. (""The room should feel empty when youre in it"" Redgrave instructs.) That kicks off a rather pro-forma account of Gaines ascent through the ranks of servitude first as the teenage apprentice to a kindly North Carolina hotel butler (Clarence Williams III) then on to Washington D.C.s swank Excelsior Hotel where the now-adult Cecil (Forest Whitaker) catches the eye of a senior Truman staffer. The White House scenes that follow prove livelier and more interesting as Gaines gets indoctrinated by a fussbudget maitre d (the excellent Colman Domingo) and learns the ropes from the reigning head butler (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and his second-in-command (Lenny Kravitz). In one of the few observations that Daniels doesnt drive home with a sledgehammer the presidential mansion is seen as a veritable simulacrum of the plantation house with the same expectation of ""invisibility"" for service staff who are also instructed to see nothing and hear nothing of the sometimes momentous events taking place before them. Where ""Forrest Gump"" kept its parade of historical personages restricted to real archival footage however ""The Butler"" nearly capsizes in the first hour under a flotilla of special-guest-star presidents and first ladies who seem imported directly from Madame Tussauds. Given Daniels background as a casting director and the savvy stunt casting hes done in the past its stunning how off most of the calculations are here from Robin Williams embalmed Eisenhower to Alan Rickmans ghoulishly overacted Reagan. And while Strong has written a sly funny scene in which then-vice president Nixon panders for votes among the kitchen staff John Cusack is so un-Nixonian in the role that the whole thing feels like a put-on. (Tyler Perry would have been preferable.) Liev Schreiber and James Marsden fare better as LBJ and JFK respectively even if their scenes never quite transcend a certain mechanical Illustrated Classics feel. Amazingly the film omits one of the juiciest anecdotes from Haygoods article in which JFK blanches at the sight of Sammy Davis Jr. arriving for an official White House soiree with his white wife May Britt on his arm. Only Whitaker and his stoic sentry-like presence keep things from turning completely corny. Gaines is a tricky role to navigate because the character is so inherently recessive but Whitaker digs in deep and gives a marvelous under-the-skin performance; he seems to catch the very essence of a man who has spent his whole life trying not to be seen. In her first live-action dramatic role since 1998s ""Beloved"" Oprah Winfrey makes the most of her few scenes as Cecils dutiful wife Gloria though she isnt given much to work with and the pics efforts to manufacture some third-act marital strife feels plastered on for cheap dramatic effect. Meanwhile whatever seismic historical events dont pass under Gaines nose at work turn up in his living room like clockwork thanks to one son Charlie (Elijah Kelly) who goes off to Vietnam and another Louis (David Oyelowo) who devotes himself to the civil-rights struggle. Yet almost in spite of itself the film belatedly springs to life largely thanks to Oyelowo who plays Louis from a teenager to a middle-aged man with some help from makeup but mostly with the transformative inner force of a great actor. Even when the plotting remains leaden and predictable hes electrifying to watch and as the character makes his way through various protest movements (from the Freedom Riders to the Black Panthers) Daniels develops a strong sense of the inner complexities and contradictions of the civil-rights landscape. (When Louis shows up for a family dinner looking like a cross between Che Guevara and Eldridge Cleaver accusing Sidney Poitier -- and indirectly Cecil himself -- of being an Uncle Tom the scene is pointed and funny for all the right reasons.) Gradually the tension between Louis increasingly radical views and Cecils noncommittal ones becomes the most compelling thing about the movie and Daniels has the good sense to go with it. ""The Butler"" is being sold with the ad line ""One quiet voice can ignite a revolution"" and the movie strives to suggest that by sheer steady force of presence Gaines -- and men and women like him -- managed to have a significant impact on race relations in America. But in dramatic terms it never quite makes the case. Gaines voice is so quiet that it takes him until the 1980s to make a stand for equal pay for blacks on the White House staff -- a moment Daniels treats as a watershed but which seems more like a sad reflection on the slow crawl of racial progress at the seat of government and by extension in Hollywood too where ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (which ""The Butler"" also resembles) was trumping ""Do the Right Thing"" at the Oscars around the same time Gaines would have been asking for that raise. If this is a revolution one shudders to think of the status quo. Theres no denying though that Daniels knows how to push an audiences buttons and as crudely obvious as ""The Butler"" can be -- whether juxtaposing a Woolworths lunch-counter protest with a formal White House dinner or showing a character keeling over at the breakfast table with oxygen tank attached -- its also genuinely rousing. By the end its hard not to feel moved if also more than a bit manhandled. Pics modest 25 million budget -- small for a period drama of this scale -- is reflected in a White House set with a marked soundstage feel ill served by cinematographer Andrew Dunns gauzy diffuse lighting schemes. But the costumes by Ruth Carter (""Amistad"" ""Malcolm X"") are generally superb as are the prosthetic makeup effects of Clinton Wayne and Oscar winner Matthew Mungle.

Susan Wells says March 16 2015 at 1249 pm Loved that movie. actually he is my favorite actor. Love watching his movies. Reply M says September 3 2013 at 608 pm I was curious what are freedom riders? I thought it was freedom writers as in freedom of speech for all but now I think I misinterpreted that? I thought the movie was really good. Odd as it may seem I thought both father and son were both right on their stance even though opposing. One might have been more valid than another but I didnt give it any further thought. Reply ickey DeKeyzer says August 27 2013 at 609 pm No way this movie was rawbold historically most accurate poiniant and tender. We had a chance to viewat lest on film what heartbreak love and trauma black families endured at the whaite mans expense. It should be ahown in all High Schools. Reply ted says August 27 2013 at 614 pm Another reason public schools are a joke and a sewer of revision fantasy. Reply ted says August 27 2013 at 410 pm Great point...respect without merit never works. Reply Sarah Reynolds says August 27 2013 at 406 pm So funny that when we watch shows like Downton Abbey the Butler position is considered a position of prestige and privilege. Most races would see it that way. However when it is a movie about an African American butler the position has to be seen as demeaning. Why cant this country drop the racial call. This story is about a person who was head butler at the White House. Who would not covet that position? Is it not about time we stop screaming inequality? People Oprah is one of the richest women in the world. Barack Obama is president of the United States of America and Eugene Allen was head butler in the White House for the thirty years. When is enough enough??? Reply Julienne says August 20 2013 at 420 pm Oh by the way...just read about all the ""Made-Up"" racist stories of rape and murder in the movie..THAT NEVER HAPPENED? Not cool. I guess Lee Daniels has the right to make crap up to sell tickets. Reply sharon says August 22 2013 at 749 pm TELL ME WHAT MOVIE OR DOCUMENTRARY IS ALL FACT AND NO FICTION. CAN A BLACK PERSON DO ANYTHING CORRECTLY WITHOUT BEING AN UNCLE TOM OR AUNT JANE? THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE US AMERICA. FREEDOM OF SPEECH EXPRESSION. YET IF IT DOES NOT MEET THE STATUS QUO OF WHAT THE BELTWAY THINKS IS RIGHT YOU ARE DISCREDITED AND CONSIDERED ANTI AMERICAN. OR A RACE BAITER. HOW SOON DO WE FORGET . IT REALLY HAS HAS NOT BEEN THAT LONG AGO THAT OUR AMERICAN HISTORY WAS TOLD. ITS A STORY. NOT REALITY. THAT SAD CHAPTER OF THIS HISTORY IS THAT THREE GENEARTIONS SINCE HAVE NO CIVIC LOVE OR DUTY TO THIS GREAT COUNTRY. IT IS NOT TAUGHT AT HOME OR IN SCHOOLS. ALL MINORITIES ARE ""NOT GANSTAS."" GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DO. IT IS ENTERTAINMENT. QUIT ALL OF THE POLITICS. CAN WE JUST SIT AND WATCH A MOVIE? Reply Julienne says August 27 2013 at 549 am Soooooooooooo he has to ""Make-up"" racist story lines? What was his motive for doing that? Yeah no answer...as always. marvin larry (imsolarry) says August 22 2013 at 123 pm The movie is a work of fiction inspired by a true story. Reply ted says August 20 2013 at 221 pm You got just the casting alone is hilariously stupid Reply Diana says August 20 2013 at 1210 pm Race relations will never get Better If the truth is simply dismissed as Race baiting. The film brought to light some of the more overt and more subtle Aspects of racism For the purpose of the Improving race relations in the USA Not to race bait. Bravo to the Film makers. Reply Julienne says August 21 2013 at 416 am What do you call it? The rape amp; murder scenes never happened in the true story. The white on black crimes in this movie NEVER happened. Thats called sensationalization Using ""Made-up"" white on black crimes to emotional affect the audience. Reply Julienne says August 20 2013 at 416 pm The truth is... theres more black mayors and black Police Chiefs running Police stations than white in the big cities...theres more blacks in Government than white in our democrat party...theres more rich blacks every year than whites Latinos Asians etc-etc (including rappers professional athletes actors musicians) it goes on and on. Get over it. Until you admit that more black-slave owners sold their slaves in Africa youll never get it. AND why do you call yourself African American? I dont call myself Spanish American...or should I? What about the Irish? Are they Irish Americans...cmon man. Reply Dee says August 25 2013 at 411 pm So there were also African slave owners how does that change anything. We get it we lived it. You are the one who doesnt get it. No movie is perfect. Bravo to Daniels. Job well done. Dee says August 25 2013 at 401 pm And your point is..... There are also a lot of white Mayors Politicians Athletes and more white republicans and this proves what? We choose to call ourselves African American because that is where we come from its our heritage. You may choose to represent yourself any way you want because you have always have that freedom totally your choice. I do know people who refer to thems Dee says August 25 2013 at 1058 am It may not have happened in this particular scenario in the book. But whether you believe it or not that scene took place almost every day in real life. So Daniels took a little creative freedom based on real life situations done in movies everyday. I guess its wrong only if a person of color does it. It just told the truth its our history dont hate the truth. Dee says August 19 2013 at 837 am This kind of movie review makes me sick to my stomach. To read glittering generalities about Lee Daniels ""first PG-13 outing and the chitlin-circuit"" is an insult to Mr. Daniels lifestyle choice and his ethnicity. When I read a movie review I want subtext information about the characters in the movie; not the director You sound as if you would like to be manhandled - but we do not know by whom I miss Roger Eberts movie reviews Reply Patsy Forrester says August 18 2013 at 906 pm In this review I would have liked to have heard a little more re the historical accuracy of this film...I gather there were enough liberties taken w/how our history actually transpired...If that is the case I will definitely not be spending my  to see this movie... If I am to see a movie that has been touted as ""historically correct""..then it needs to be just that.. Reply Larry B says August 18 2013 at 1240 pm Wow chitlin-circuit ""house nigger"" sledge hammer. The review of negroe movies are the gift that keeps on giving. Where would be without white folks review of our movies. I will see the movie today just wondering are there any watermelon or lynching scenes. You know we want you white folks to get their moneys worth until The Help 2 comes out. Reply C Prier says August 17 2013 at 700 am As a black 68 year old woman brought up in the south I can relate to many of the racial incidents that were expressed in this movie. This movie reminded me of where we were then and how we are SLOWLY overcoming the injustice that still exist in this society. Lee Daniels did a superb job in delivering this true story to us. I know it may sound like fiction to some because of the brutal hate and violence but......IT HAPPENED Reply G. Jardoness says August 9 2013 at 443 pm If only Oliver Stone had adapted and directed it? The lid wouldve been blown exposing the intrigue of unbridled power wielded behind the scenes by mastermind and king-maker Eugene Allen -- if that is his real name? PS. I have yet to receive my complementary Blu-ray and personal visit from Mr. Weinstein office regarding its inclusion this award season. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says August 10 2013 at 258 pm Oliver Stone certainly would not have shied away or blanched in staging JFKs true colors ""...the film omits one of the juiciest anecdotes from Haygoods article in which JFK blanches at the sight of Sammy Davis Jr. arriving for an official White House soiree with his white wife May Britt on his arm."" Reply ted says August 9 2013 at 1030 am Hanoi Jane Fonda is a non starter- you could not pay me to see this movie Reply Laurean says August 9 2013 at 1005 am As an Ivy League grad and African-American blogger on Pop Culture I find this review slightly naive about real-life experiences about real people of color in America. My parents are from a small town in North Carolina who lived through the injustice of segregation and the rewards of the Civil Rights Movement (both came from big families with very little money but both pursued higher ed degrees in politics and nursing). They moved to Miami FL to pursue the American Dream their parents promised them and were successful. Just because you havent lived that life doesnt mean its ""fictional"" to another community of ""oxygen-deprived adult moviegoers."" And that ""chitlin-circuit theatrical"" gives audiences hope for something better than the difficult lives of illness unemployment crime and deaths. Reply Julienne says August 20 2013 at 643 am Then tell the entire story...of how African Blacks sold slaves from rival tribes to every country in the world...EVERY Country that had a boat to get there. Reply George Valentin says August 9 2013 at 935 am I am appalled there are some Right Wingers who want to boycott this movie since one of its stars is Jane Fonda. I hope Jane Fonda gets nominated for Best Supporting Actress just to spite them. Reply atomic studio says August 9 2013 at 746 am sounds like it would have been a better daytime film than a summer blockbuster entry Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says August 10 2013 at 314 pm Certainly anyone viewing the trailer experiences that spontaneous feeling that LEE DANIELS THE BUTLER is a TV movie being shown in theaters to capitalize on the storys based-on-true-events status and the list of notable actors in historic roles as well as the Weinsteins (shrewdly) hoping to capitalize on the 100k success of ""42"" (the Jackie Robinson story)...the only reason this film has not gone straight to video. Lee Daniels best work -- so far and by far -- is little mentioned THE SHADOWBOXER a film that impresses upon the viewer the directors diversity but also his unbridled talent. Reply Julienne says August 20 2013 at 422 pm News Flash...LDaniels made-up the ""Rape amp; Murder"" story-lines to sell tickets. It NEVER happened in the true story. Race-Baiter. Josh says August 9 2013 at 706 am Please explain the usage of the n-word in your piece. (House N--) just curious. Is this a quote or usage of the actually word or spoken by character or a characterization. Popular culture what is acceptable. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says August 10 2013 at 327 pm Modern sensitivities insist upon a certain decorum -- or political correctness -- while in fact ""nigger"" is offhandedly used among African-Americans has not been outlawed by the Congress and a common epithet throughout American history. A byname equally applied to people of Irish Jewish Italian Latino German and Arab descent. And of course Native-Americans (The Washington ""Redskins""). If such historical films are indeed based on ""true events"" then let us not stand on ceremony if a reviewer chooses to use a disparaging turn-of-phrase inside or outside the context of the movie in question although it is certain the ""N-word"" (as in the fictional DJANGO UNCHAINED) was worn to a frazzle. Reply frankofile says August 9 2013 at 535 am Chitlin circuit? REALLY? Reply deborah holt says August 9 2013 at 1244 am I guess u pretty much explains it all. Its a good or its a bad movie?

While its ostensibly the story of the title character who views the passage of history in his service to seven presidents the movie feels most alive when it exits the White House. Actor (""Mad Men"" ""Gilmore Girls"") turned screenwriter Danny Strong has proven his adeptness at the popcorn-politics saga with his breezily witty and watchable HBO movies ""Recount"" and ""Game Change."" He brings that approach here taking decisive moments in American history and boiling them down to human-size experiences. (Strongs script is based on Wil Haygoods magazine article ""A Butler Well Served by This Election."") Also read MPAA Rules Weinstein Can Use Lee Daniels The Butler The cuckoo-rococo side of Daniels that boundaries-free showman behind such loony spectacles as ""The Paperboy"" and ""Shadowboxer"" is nowhere to be found here; instead hes operating very much in awards-bait mode juggling historical grandeur family turmoil and a changing societal landscape. In 1926 the Gaines family works as sharecroppers on a farm that could just as well be a pre-Civil War plantation; young Cecil (Ami Ameen) witnesses the rape of his mother (Mariah Carey) and murder of his father (David Banner) at the hands of the cruel landowner (Alex Pettyfer). Shocked at the incident the assailants mother (Vanessa Redgrave) takes in young Cecil and trains him to be an in-house servant. (Thats not the term she uses incidentally.) See video Lee Daniels the Butler Clip Features Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan As a young man Cecil hits the road to find a better life for himself surviving the Depression and working his way up to a hotel in Washington D.C. where he is overheard giving benign answers to a politico asking him pointed questions about Brown vs. Board of Education. Soon after he gets the call to work as a butler in the White House under Eisenhower (Robin Williams) and his long tenure begins. Cecil mutely observes a parade of chief executives -- Kennedy (James Marsden) Johnson (Liev Schreiber) Nixon (John Cusack) and Reagan (Alan Rickman) -- grapple with race issues and at home his son Louis (David Oyelowo) goes off to Fisk and gets politicized joining the Freedom Riders and later the Black Panthers resenting his fathers status as a domestic and as an adjunct to the white establishment. Its the ""inspired by a true story"" relationship between Cecil and Louis that gives the movie its real power as we see how generations of African-Americans took differing viewpoints on the struggle for civil rights and the tactics used to gain them. The most memorable sequence of ""The Butler"" features Cecil and his fellow staff members (including Lenny Kravitz and Cuba Gooding Jr.) setting places for a state dinner while Louis and his fellow protesters stage a sit-in at a Nashville Woolworths enduring first verbal and then physical abuse by angry racists. As a mass-audience-friendly portrayal of this nations legacy of racism ""The Butler"" is head and shoulders above feel-good kitsch like ""The Help"" because it portrays racism as ingrained institutionalized and part of the legal system rather than simply being the result of vocal and identifiably mean people. Racism was (and in many ways still is) part and parcel of the system and its Cecils coming to understand and acknowledge that fact that gives ""The Butler"" much of its power. Where the movie falls apart is in its desire to deliver Oscar-clip money shots; I counted three or four occasions where the score by Rodrigo Leao wells up for whats supposed to be a ""cry now"" moment but the intended sweep just isnt there. Its too bad Daniels seemingly felt compelled to fish for tears because ""The Butler"" has no shortage of powerful scenes and memorable performances. Oyelowo steals the show aging over the course of the movie from a 17-year-old high-school student to a 60-ish Obama supporter and he perfectly captures the anger and idealism of youth without making the character a cliche or a mere mouthpiece. Whitaker embodies the quiet dignity of a man who has spent his life showing one face to his employers and another to his friends and family and Oprah Winfrey (as Cecils wife Gloria) is clearly reveling in the opportunity to shake up her image a bit and play a boozy adulteress. (Her smoking scenes alas reveal some of the least convincing inhaling ever performed on screen.) Shes the beneficiary of the parade of the eras fashions going from conservative 1950s outfits to the more out-there dresses and hairstyles of the 1960s and 1970s. Its telling that Gloria disapproves of the afro and hoop earrings sported by Louiss radical girlfriend in 1968 but is rocking the look herself just a few years later as shes dancing to ""Soul Train."" Its also worth noting that the old-age prosthetics created by the films talented team are uniformly excellent. Thats one prize ""The Butler"" has strong shot at winning. The celeb cameos inside the White House are amusing but mostly inconsequential although it definitely counts as a pop culture moment when Jane Fonda plays Nancy Reagan. The presidents wind up being background players in this story anyway where the personal really is the political. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Thats a plus Until a climax that resurrects the euphoria of the 2008 election Daniels wisely allows the material to work on its own terms. In fact ""The Butler"" carries an authenticity that sustains it through its cloying stretches. While black presidential butler Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) is a fictional creation the characters story draws from the real-life experiences of Eugene Allen who served through eight administrations from Eisenhower to Reagan. Daniels portrays Gaines life in a straightforward fashion playing up the sentimentality in tandem with its historical weight -- hardly a surprise for such blatant Oscar bait. Working within those expectations Daniels has a delivered a fairly thoughtful period drama. Indeed its a far more tolerable portrait of race in America than ""The Help""which was part of the 2011 awards season race in much the same way that ""The Butler"" has already entered the 2013 edition. Although Gaines lives in a white mans world Daniels movie contains hardly any white characters. Anchored by Whitakers low-key performance and a surprisingly palatable turn by Oprah Winfrey as his stay-at-home wife ""The Butler"" takes its cues from the lead character and foregrounds unquestionably stirring material. Though occasionally cheesy in its celebratory approach to the progress of civil rights Daniels story (written by Danny Strong and adapted from Wil Haygoods Washington Post article) is a sturdy alternative approach to 50 years of presidential history. Because it covers so much ground the movie never slows down. Within minutes Daniels provides an overview of the first three decades in Gaines life We first see him as a child witnessing his fathers death at the hands of a mindless overseer leading to Gaines training as a ""house nigger"" before he sets out on his own and learns to view that term as a pejorative. Then its the late fifties and hes settled into a gig at a posh D.C. hotel where he catches the eye of a White House staffer. The rest is history -- but with a unique point of view. Dividing his time between a settled lower-class existence on the outskirts of town with his wife Gloria (Winfrey) and their two young children Gaines adapts to a life in the White House. At this point ""The Butler"" falters Using famous faces to play famous names creates an unintentionally comedic effect. The first glimpses of Robin Williams as Dwight Eisenhower and John Cusack doing a mild Richard Nixon impersonation invite immediate chortles -- as does Liev Schreiber whose broad and cranky caricature of a constipated Lyndon B. Johnson involves a scene in which he sits on the can and orders Gaines to bring him prune juice. Here Daniels campy qualities threaten to overtake the material but these irreverent asides mercifully recede as Gaines bears witness to historical events from multiple angles at once. At home he copes with his older son Louiss (David Oyelowo) burgeoning radicalism which begins with the early stirrings of civil rights protest in the south and eventually leads him to join the Black Panther party. Whitakers expression of rage toward the sons attitude forms a telling contrast with Gaines subdued demeanor at work where he watches closely as presidents ranging from Eisenhower to Kennedy show a modicum of compassion for African-American struggles. Only when he overhears Nixons condemnation of the Black Panthers does he start to contemplate whether theres more than pure carelessness to the activism that drives his son forward. These moments showcase a curious tension between Daniels heavy-handed approach to historical events and the emotional realism that enhances them. As demonstrated by their most outlandish extremes Daniels movies aim to please and the strongest bits of ""The Butler"" involve the small triumphs that define Gaines career such as his urging a superior for a raise or receiving an official invite to a White House dinner and getting served by his colleagues. His sons experiences with the surge of intellectualism among black radicals provides a didactic but provocative commentary on Gaines importance. In discussion with Martin Luther King Jr. (Nelsan Ellis) Louis listens to a discussion of ""the black domestic"" a more advanced reading of the ""house nigger"" mentality that initially defined Gaines work ethic. ""In many ways they are subversive without even knowing it"" observes the scholar. Its this gentle innocence that allows Gaines to remain so inherently likable as well as a figure of provocation. Furious with his sons activism Gaines plays the role of witness rather than hero. Daniels explores this mentality in visual terms particularly with one outstanding montage that shifts between Louis getting arrested after a nasty showdown during an Alabama sit-in and Gaines going through the motions of his daily routine. While veering on overstatement the educational perspective is balanced off by glances at Gaines home life particularly his tender relationship with his wife. Even as a minor subplot involving her affair with a shady neighbor (Terrence Howard) goes nowhere Winfrey never overplays her role and Daniels only toys with melodramatic possibilities rather than allowing them to take over. That changes at the very end when Daniels turns up the histrionics for the 2008 election. Yet the finale remains more or less faithful to the original article that spawned the movie and ""The Butler"" cant be faulted for indulging in the same triumphant spirit experienced by the source of Gaines character. The last words of the movie are all too familiar -- ""Yes we can"" -- a grandiose gesture to be sure but one that feels earned. Just as Gaines served his presidents ""The Butler"" serves the legacy of its subject. The name of the movie implies that Lee Daniels lords over the material but its true author is Eugene Allen. Criticwire grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? The Weinstein Company releases ""The Butler"" nationwide on August 16. Its strong appeal for black audiences suggest a strong turnout for this underserved niche and the movie seems well-positioned to gain some decent traction for its performances during awards season.

Inspired by the true story of an African-American steward who worked under eight presidents (Truman through Reagan) the film stars Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines -- an unassuming man who witnesses history close-up at a time when a new chapter seems to be written daily. As proof of how radically the world will change during his lifetime the story begins with Cecil as a boy working on a cotton plantation where his employer (a fragile haughty Vanessa Redgrave) teaches him how to serve white folks ""The room should feel empty when youre in it."" Years pass and Cecil lands a job at a ritzy D.C. hotel where his white-gloved obsequiousness grabs the attention of a White House aide who hires him. As the film skims Forrest Gump-style through turbulent decades and various inhabitants of the Oval Office (a fun but distracting parade of famous faces including Robin Williams as Eisenhower John Cusack as Nixon and Alan Rickman and Jane Fonda as the Reagans) Cecil struggles with his messier home life. Its the only place where his gift for orderliness fails him. His wife (a beautifully nuanced Oprah Winfrey) is an alcoholic and his older son (David Oyelowo) is a rebellious civil rights activist. Neither can draw this Invisible Man out of his shell. As Cecil Whitaker is mesmerizing. The actor seems to shrink into his imposing frame summoning a performance of quiet bottled-up force. Theres no question that Daniels the director of 2009s Precious deserves some of the credit for that. But as undeniably moving and powerful as his film is it could have used more of that subtlety. The fact that he even comes close makes The Butler worth seeing.
