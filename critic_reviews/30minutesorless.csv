Comments click to enlarge 30 Minutes or Less Video Rated R  83 minutes  2011 Reuben Fleischers Zombieland was a promising debut combining the cheap thrills of a horror-comedy with genuine character observation and some surprisingly graceful camera work. Those virtues are still present in his second feature but just barely junior-high-level one-liners are the chief order of business here. (This remains a must-see however if you find racial slurs or anal sex inherently funny.) Jesse Eisenberg--displaying remarkable commitment to his role given the material--plays a pizza delivery boy whos kidnapped by dumbasses and forced to rob a bank; Aziz Ansari not quite acting plays the high-strung friend who agrees to help him out. The film contains a remarkable level of violence yet never establishes a tone that would make it seem funny or truly shocking; the jokes flounder in an air of half-hearted spite.

The pictures did get small. 30 Minutes or Less is a short sharp and disposable comedy from Ruben Fleischer the director behind 2009s short sharp and utterly disposable Zombieland. Jesse Eisenberg plays entirely to type (no bad thing) as rebellious smart-alec pizza delivery boy Nick who gets tangled up in a zany shakedown whereby Danny McBrides murderous blockhead Dwayne is trying to get his sweaty paws on his fathers fortune. So Nick is kidnapped by Dwayne has a homemade bomb strapped to his chest and is ordered to rob the local bank to get money to pay an assassin...Its very very silly. But the lunacy of the plot is softened by the cranky repartee between Dwayne and his dimwitted flame-thrower-brandishing sidekick Travis (Nick Swardson) and Nick and his old college buddy turned accomplice Chet (Aziz Ansari). The highlight of the entire film is an extraneous argument between Nick and Chet where they viciously trump one another by blurting out foul deeds theyve committed in the past.As throwaway as it all is there are a few neat touches that should prove diverting to enthusiasts of 1980s Hollywood cinema Nick hurtles around in a similar crappy blue Chevy Nova to the one Axel Foley drives in Beverly Hills Cop while the entire bomb plot is a feature-length riff on the iconic exploding-toilet scene from Lethal Weapon 2. Its funny clever and pacy to a fault and the script more than satisfies its quota of decent zings. By all means head along if you require some in-the-moment laughter therapy but the title also refers to how long itll remain in your memory after its all done.

By Meghan Keane  08/16/11 730pm Jesse Eisenberg and Aziz Ansari in 30 Minutes Or Less. ""30 Minutes or Less"" is the wish-fulfillment fantasy that generations of slacker pizza delivery guys have been waiting for. The rest of the world may look down on the stoners who deliver their pies but Jesse Eisenberg is here to prove that the lowly pizza guy has the catlike reflexes driving skills and ease under pressure to handle the most stressful of situations (like say getting kidnapped by two chubby dudes with an explosion fetish who force him to rob a bank). All in a days work for your noble pizza dude who makes up for his lack of career/life ambition with a wealth of MacGyver-like survival skills. If parents catch on to the films moral--which appears to be that you can turn a lazy college grads life around by strapping a bomb to his chest--America might have more to worry about than the debt ceiling. But for now 30 Minutes or Less is a harmless funny little coming of age story that fits neatly into its 83-minute run time. And while it may be hard to believe the guy who played Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network as a slacker delivery guy once you suspend your disbelief about that (and his willingness to turn to a life of crime) things start moving pretty smoothly. When the movie opens Nick gets into a fight with his only friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) over the fact that he slept with Chets twin sister Kate (Dilshad Vadsaria). After they brawl and end their friendship it becomes clear that Nick is in love with Kate and unable to tell her. Nothing a little bank robbery cant solve Luckily for Nick he is about to cross paths with the equally undermotivated Dwayne (Danny McBride) who is disgruntled that his military veteran father the Major (Fred Ward) has won millions of dollars in the lottery and resents him for being a video game-obsessed layabout. The Major refuses to give any of his winnings to Dwayne and until he kicks the bucket Dwayne is forced to go through life as a penniless miscreant. In the meantime Dwayne bides his time waiting for his dad to croak by blowing up watermelons with his pal Travis (Nick Swardson). But when he tells a stripper during a lap dance that he will be a millionaire after his dad dies she quickly comes up with a plot to kill the Major and make them both rich. (Kids--this is why your mom wants you to stay out of strip clubs) Trouble is its going to cost 100000 to get the Major killed so Dwayne and Travis devise a plan to get a certain unsuspecting delivery guy to do their dirty work for them. They call for a pizza fit Nick with an explosive vest and give him 10 hours to return with cash from their local bank. Some men might show trepidation in executing this plan of grand larceny but not our hero He enlists the help of his friend Chet and gets to bank robbing. Along the way Nick repairs their friendship gets the girl and generally learns to love life again. 30 Minutes or Less manages to do all this with plenty of humor and a few good car chase scenes (the whole thing was filmed in Michigan and is a bit of a love song to the American-made automobile). The emotional investment between the male leads is sometimes lacking (and the relationship drama between Mr. Eisenberg and Ms. Vadsaria is more of an afterthought than a crux to the plot) but all the men on screen seem more than comfortable in their roles. They should be as theyve all played them before. Director Ruben Fleischer also did Zombieland that other hero nerd adventure story Mr. Eisenberg starred in that wasnt Adventureland. And 30 Minutes or Less borrows heavily from other comedies like Superbad Pineapple Express I Love You Man The Foot Fist Way and Tropic Thunder. The characters relationships and even the actors have already appeared in other recent movies together. In the end 30 Minutes or Less is a tidy entertaining nerd action movie that should provide a good distraction for viewers this summer. It just probably has the approximate cultural staying power of its title.

"30 Minutes or Less | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 30-minutes-or-less ) 30 Minutes or Less (United States 2011) August 12 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli It would be possible to form a tragedy from the background inspiration of Ruben Fleishers 30 Minutes or Less but the filmmakers have not traveled that route. Instead of fashioning a heartbreaking tale about greed and inhumanity Fleisher has applied the same fast scattershot approach to this movie that he employed to good effect for his breakthrough effort Zombieland. The dark biting comedy often strays into territory that can be categorized as politically incorrect but the result is funny engaging and at times a little disconcerting. The action in and of itself isnt groundbreaking but the comedic elements keep things like a routine car chase from becoming lackluster. 30 Minutes or Less release date indicates its not expected to be one of the summers big guns but it is in some ways more satisfying than a majority of the releases bearing such a label. Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) is a post-college age pizza delivery boy who lives in an ambition free zone. His best (only?) friend is Chet (Aziz Ansari) a teacher who believes he has reached his career pinnacle. These two buddies are going through a rough patch at the moment - due in large part to Nicks confession that he once had sex with Chets twin sister Kate (Dilshad Vadsaria) - but Chet is the one Nick turns to when hes in trouble. And its big trouble. Two inept thugs Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardon) need 100 thousand to pay off a hit man (Michael Pena) to kill Dwaynes Type A Ex-Marine Father (Fred Ward). To get that money they concoct a scheme whereby they will kidnap some unsuspecting schlub dress him in a bomb vest and instruct him to rob a bank or risk going ""boom"" Then they order a pizza... Tone is critical to a movie of this nature and Fleischer gets it right. There are occasional moments of drama and instances when the action elements are elevated but for the most part this is a comedy and is recognized as such. With the main characters being slackers it is unsurprising that much of the humor is in that vein but there are also some more mainstream gags as well. Compared to many of the years ruder cruder offerings 30 Minutes or Less comes across as almost gentle; its sex jokes are sophomoric but not grotesque and theres not a lot of envelope-pushing going on here. As Nick Eisenberg is credible which is a credit to the actor who has shown a knack for playing both an ambitious genius and an ambitionless doofus. Nick doesnt come across as a complete moron but the measure of the man may be that he is easily outmaneuvered by two idiots so that doesnt say much for his intelligence. Its easy to lose patience with protagonists who are not blessed with an abundance of smarts but Eisenberg is so likeable and appealing in a slacker/stoner way that most viewers will still find themselves rooting for Nick. Danny McBride and Nick Swardon are effective villains for this kind of movie. Theyre more oafish than frightening and while that might be a poor characteristic in a serious action movie its a strong plus for something like 30 Minutes or Less. McBride is more in his element here than he was in Your Highness; his personality is better suited to slightly warped hard-to-take-seriously bad guys than slightly warped hard-to-take-seriously heroic types. His presence calls to mind Pineapple Express with which 30 Minutes or Less shares some slacker sensibilities. Fred Ward and Michael Pena dont have a lot to do. Wards turn as the Major has the right over-the-top vibe; Pena is a little on the intense side. 30 Minutes or Less isnt as fresh as Zombieland and it doesnt feel as original. But as a second feature it more-or-less does whats expected of it. The weakest ingredient in the brew is the ""buddy"" element which is tepid at best due in large part to the lack of tangible chemistry between Eisenberg and Aziz Ansari. These two are no Harold and Kumar. Fortunately however the movie doesnt try to oversell this aspect. In fact with its short sweet 83-minute running time it never threatens to overstay its welcome and flaws that could become glaring problems (underdeveloped characters a tacked-on romance) are less obvious and more forgivable given the brevity of the material. Most important of all 30 Minutes or Less never runs out of comedic steam. 30 Minutes or Less (United States 2011) Director Ruben Fleischer Cast Jesse Eisenberg Aziz Ansari Danny McBride Nick Swardson Dilshad Vadsaria Michael Pena Fred Ward Screenplay Michael Diliberti Cinematography Jess Hall Music Theodore Shapiro U.S. Distributor Columbia Pictures Run Time 123 U.S. Release Date 2011-08-12 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Profanity Violence Sexual Content Nudity) Genre COMEDY/ACTION Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Hot Fuzz (2007) Tropic Thunder (2008) worse movies of this genre Hot Pursuit (2015) Date Night (2010) This Means War (2012) Three...better movies of Jesse Eisenberg Adventureland (2009) Social Network The (2010) Squid and the Whale The (2005) worse movies of Jesse Eisenberg Cursed (2005) To Rome with Love (2012) American Ultra (2015) Three...better movies of Aziz Ansari (There are no more better movies of Aziz Ansari) worse movies of Aziz Ansari (There are no more worst movies of Aziz Ansari) Three...better movies of Danny McBride Tropic Thunder (2008) This is the End (2013) (There are no more better movies of Danny McBride) worse movies of Danny McBride Land of the Lost (2009) Aloha (2015) Your Highness (2011) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2337,200,30minutesorless4,30minutesorless,reelviews

He showed tellers a device hanging from a collar around his neck and told them it was a bomb that would go off unless he received the money. He left with just under 9000 and when apprehended by police shortly thereafter claimed to have been a hostage forced to rob the bank against his will. A bomb disposal unit was called but before it arrived the device detonated killing Wells. (Television cameras were more prompt and captured footage of the gruesome event.) Though many details of the bizarre plot remain unclear it appears that Wells may have been initially a willing accomplice who believed the bomb to be used would be fake. (A good Wired story on the entire episode can be found here.) As trifles go it is well-cast well-engineered and well-suited to the demands of a late-summer diversion The stars and director of 30 Minutes or Less say they were unaware of the Wells case; the screenwriters acknowledge they were ""vaguely"" familiar with it. And while its true that the film diverges substantially from the events in Erie--most obviously by steering far afield of the tragic conclusion--the similarities are numerous and clearly not coincidental. And unlike say the Coen brothers Fargo which also spun elements of a real crime to its own fictional ends 30 Minutes or Less--a fast foul-mouthed and intermittently very funny comedy--borrows Wellss unhappy tale for purely frivolous ends. I confess Im of mixed minds regarding the degree to which this appropriation is well appropriate. But it seems worthy of mention. The movie reunites Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer with star Jesse Eisenberg though the pairing this time out is somewhat less successful. Eisenberg plays Nick a low-ambition though of necessity high-velocity distributor of Vitos Pizza in Grand Rapids Michigan. (Motto ""30 minutes or less or its free."") Summoned to deliver a pizza to a salvage yard he is instead accosted and chloroformed by two lowlifes in ape masks. These are Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson)--the former eager to raise money for a hitman to kill his wealthy dad (Fred Ward); the latter eager to please the former. When Nick awakes wearing a C4-bedecked vest his captors tell him he has 10 hours to rob a local bank (""by the Olive Garden"") or else his insides will intermingle unpleasantly with the outside. Nick enlists the aid of his recently estranged best friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) and the two begin their career in grand larceny. Though it eschews an undead apocalypse 30 Minutes or Less is a nastier comedy than Zombieland perhaps midway betweenPineapple Express and Observe and Report on the black humor scale. There are times when the movies insistent crassness and recourse to obscenity become tiresome. (An oral sex/voyeurism scene comes to mind along with a substantial fraction of McBrides dialogue.) And notwithstanding a romantic subplot involving Chets twin sister (Dilshad Vadsaria) the narrative lens is overwhelmingly exhaustingly male. Still Fleischer imbues the film with the same heedless almost kinetic momentum he brought to its predecessor and the humor though broad is generally sharp with knowing swipes at targets ranging from Point Break Netflix and Matchbox 20 to Alien The Hurt Locker and Slumdog Millionaire. Eisenberg brings his customarily alert comic intelligence to the role of Nick. McBride by contrast displays rather more of his trademarked moron-machismo than one might wish in the end the McBride-lite offered by Swardson is more palatable (compensation perhaps for the embarrassments the actor endured in Just Go With It ). Ultimately though the movie belongs to Ansari who steals nearly every scene he is in with his jangly nervous intensity. I am not a watcher of NBCs Parks and Recreation on which Ansari stars but his small roles in such movies asFunny People and Observe and Report (his Chick-fil-A line still lingers pleasantly) served as apt preparation for his performance here. 30 Minutes or Less is a trifle--and one that thanks to the story on which it was based carries some uncomfortable echoes. But as trifles go it is well-cast well-engineered and arguably well-suited to the demands of a late-summer diversion. And at just 82 minutes it is as its title suggests very quick from door to door.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings."" Continue Reading Reuters Trump Time Capsule 63 Whats In the Tax Returns? James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president. Continue Reading Zak Bickel / The Atlantic From Whitewater to Benghazi A Clinton-Scandal Primer David A. Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

R. 1 hour 49 minutes. Opens today at area theaters. Sporadically funny tiresomely foul-mouthed ""30 Minutes or Less"" pits two smart guys behaving like idiots against a pair of idiots who think theyre oh-so-clever. Who wins? Not the audience nearly enough. This is disappointing news given that the director of this sputter-rev-sputter ride is Ruben Fleischer and that nattering Jesse Eisenberg stars. The anti-hero of ""The Social Network"" portrays Nick a pizza delivery guy who is forced to rob a bank when a pair of neer-do-anythings strap a bomb to his chest. Aziz Ansari of TVs ""Parks and Recreation"" brings zippy energy as Chet Nicks former best friend and go-to guy. The action is set in Grand Rapids Mich. where a kind of economic malaise has taken root. Not only is Nick having trouble pulling himself out of a dead-end job -- or making good on his companys promise of prompt service -- but dunderheads Dwayne and Travis while away their days watching slasher movies in Dwaynes fathers house. A very dour Fred Ward portrays The Major a Marine and his sons nemesis. When a stripper (yes there has to be one in this sort of comedy) suggests a clean break with The Major Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson) come up with an idea in order to fund a hit. Fleischer and Eisenberg raised expectations for this outing with ""Zombieland"" a surprisingly sweet and fleet charmer. That genre flick was able to engage the human will to connect and also tap into the need to grieve. Though Nick is on the brink there are no such emotional dividends here. The set-up is funny enough if you dont give it too much thought. If you do you might trip over the fact that it takes inspiration from a true story that ended badly. Its a comedy so were not spoiling much by saying ""30 Minutes or Less"" isnt about real danger. Its about stupidity -- and it abounds. The movies sliver of silver lining comes by way of the sidekicks. Ansari nails Chets near-hysteria with hilarious bursts. Swardson makes Travis puppy-dog need for Dwaynes approval endearing. Often cast in the upstanding-Latino role Michael Pena unleashes his inner inmate as the hit man Chango. But the comedy is as uneven as it is undisciplined. And McBride is at his least likable. As a comic actor McBride remains a special case. He can be winning edgy fabulously wrong. Nearly as often he tilts into unfunny nastiness. Its possible the real trouble with ""30 Minutes or Less"" speaks to a greater R-rated comedy problem Just because you can say it -- or show it -- doesnt mean you should. On-the-brink comedy.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 12 2011 1102 AM 30 Minutes or Less One of the great disappointments of my cinematic year. By Dana Stevens Also in Slate Jessica Grose interviews Aziz Ansari. Jesse Eisenberg in 30 Minutes or Less 30 Minutes or Less (Columbia Pictures) the second feature from director Ruben Fleischer counts as one of the great disappointments of my cinematic year so far. Not because its such a terrible movie--like most summer comedies it has scattershot moments of mirth--but because I had such high hopes. Fleischers first film Zombieland (2009) was the kind of debut that gets you excited about a filmmakers future a dystopic road movie that struck just the right balance between dark social satire and wistful romance and starred Jesse Eisenberg Woody Harrelson Emma Stone and Bill Murray all seeming to enjoy themselves hugely. If Zombieland was a freshman effort that felt surprisingly accomplished 30 Minutes or Less is a second movie that feels more like a first slipshod derivative and unsure what tone to take toward its own sometimes distasteful subject matter. Still theres enough to like about 30 Minutes or Less that I want to sit Fleischer down as a kindly aunt might pigeonhole her wayward nephew and lecture him on what he could have done differently. Structurally 30 Minutes makes the mistake of wanting to combine Tarantino-style comic violence with soft-hearted moments of brotherly bonding. The two villains--a pair of dumb-and-dumber redneck hooligans played by Danny McBride and Nick Swardson--get established early on as selfish amoral jerks so when were asked later in the movie to invest emotionally in their friendship its simply confusing. And the relationship between the two heroes pizza-delivering slacker Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) and fussbudget schoolteacher Chet (Aziz Ansari) is sketched out so hastily that we never quite know why to root for them either other than well theyre the protagonists. Advertisement Were also on their side because Eisenberg and Ansari can be funny together. Theyre well-matched physically--two small-framed baby-faced young men with overdeveloped verbal skills--and the movie kicks off with some amusing dude banter. (When Nick refers to himself as a ""man"" in conversation Chet scoffs ""You had a Lunchables for dinner last night"") Ambitionless Nick would be fine coasting along smoking weed renting Lethal Weapon and pining for Chets twin sister Kate (Dilshad Vadsaria) with whom he spent one magic night long ago. But he falls victim to the ill-conceived kidnapping scheme of Dwayne (McBride) and Travis (Swardson). In order to raise money to hire a hit man to kill Dwaynes rich jerky father (Fred Ward) theyve decided to strap a bomb to a total stranger and force him to rob a bank. (The filmmakers have denied basing their story on the Brian Wells collar bomb case which it superficially resembles.) When Nick arrives to deliver a pizza at their isolated junkyard compound Dwayne and Travis don ape masks and chloroform him before outfitting him in a vest wired with explosives. The moment when Nick wakes up to see their masked faces looming over him and then finds the vest is realistically terrifying and Eisenberg plays it straight hyperventilating and whimpering with panic. But instead of exploring the real sadism and danger of this moment Fleischer chooses to go broad making fun of the barely competent kidnappers thuggish posturing. But if Dwayne and Travis occupy a cartoonish low-stakes fictional universe what are we to do with Nicks legitimate distress? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Even a light caper movie like this one needs to address basic questions about its characters motivations and thought processes. Ill accept a lot of holes in a plot as long as some basic logic is established--couldnt Nick and Chet at least have tried to call the cops or a bomb-defusing hotline before agreeing to the cockamamie bank-holdup plan? (The bad guys threaten to detonate the vest if they see any cops outside Nicks house but that wouldnt prevent a phone call.) I respect that this movie wants to keep it short and sweet--there should be more 83-minute heist comedies not fewer--but everything between the bursts of violence feels cursory and rushed especially the romantic relationship between Nick and Kate which later becomes pivotal to the action plot. Finally 30 Minutes or Less culminates in a gonzo shootout involving some pretty stomach-churning violence. That in itself wouldnt constitute a problem if the audience had any idea how to feel about the people all this bad stuff is happening to. Are Dwayne and Travis any better or worse than the Latino gangster (Michael Pena) who tries to horn in on their plan? How are we supposed to laugh at the villains gory comeuppances while also cheering on their interpersonal breakthroughs? Have Nick and Chet done too many shitty things to one another to deserve one anothers continued friendship? Rather than sort through the various contradictory emotional demands this final conflagration places on the viewer its easier to shift into neutral and remember some of the great moments from Zombieland.

"30 Minutes or Less Jesse Eisenberg makes most of pizza deliveryman role |       NJ.com comments 30 Minutes or Less Jesse Eisenberg makes most of pizza deliveryman role Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 12 2011 at 757 AM View/Post Comments Columbia PicturesAcademy Award nominee Jesse Eisenberg left and Aziz Ansari as partners in crime in a30 Minutes or Less.a I am about as much of a First Amendment absolutist as youll find but I still think there are some things we need to declare a moratorium on A. Comedies in which stupid bullies accuse self-conscious guys of ""acting gay"" ""going gay"" or saying something which is ""so gay."" B. Comedies in which two men driving away from a dangerous situation look at each other and then start screaming. C. Comedies which assume that if seeing a policeman wreck his car is funny -- it is right? -- seeing six policemen do it in a row is hilarious. D. Comedies starring Danny McBride. And actually if you want to be minimalist just focus on D. Itll take care of most of the rest. ""30 Minutes or Less"" isnt the worst offender mostly because it co-stars Jesse Eisenberg. That not only helps reduce McBrides screen time but also gives a young actor whos been solidly developing over the last few years a chance to shine. Although Eisenberg has been terrific in straight dramas (the snarky ""The Social Network"" the angsty ""The Squid and the Whale"") he also has slowly developed a kind of cute-nerd comedy groove in films like ""Adventureland"" and ""Zombieland."" And unlike Michael Cera he actually seems to have gone through puberty. So hes completely believable as Nick a slacker kid who is stuck in a crummy job delivering pizzas and who has stored up just enough rage that when someone pushes him too far -- trying to use him as the patsy in a bank robbery -- he turns with a vengeance. Unfortunately the details of that bank scheme -- which include a remote-controlled suicide-bombers vest -- come awfully uncomfortably close to a tragic real-life crime a little while back. Also more unfortunately Eisenberg isnt the only actor in this movie. He has as a partner in crime Aziz Ansari -- a painfully unfunny comic actor who delivers every line with the wide eyes and strained delivery of a frog whos just stuck one webbed toe in a light socket. Then theres McBride the king of the Moron Movies whose Jerk You Love to Hate shtick -- hes the character who forces Eisenberg into that bank robbery of course -- once again results only in a Character You Really Dont Want to Watch. McBride (like Ansari) clearly has his partisans; he doesnt keep getting jobs out of pity. But his characters have no depth. Theyre just rude rubes and their casually cocky ignorance gets tiresome very quickly. Eisenberg at least is easily sympathetic as the amateur robber and the film starts off with a great sequence in which his NASCAR-speed delivery of a pizza -- the title refers to his employers guarantee -- provides plenty of heart-in-your-throat moments. But without the script or solid cast of his previous film ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleischer soon falters. And the films running time and sudden ending suggest a desperate last-minute edit to cut anything that wasnt working. They stopped too soon. Ratings note The film contains strong language violence sexual situations and substance abuse. 30 Minutes or Less (R) Columbia (83 min.) Directed by Ruben Fleischer. With Jesse Eisenberg Danny McBride Aziz Ansari. Now playing in New Jersey.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies 30Minutes or Less Jesse Eisenberg and Aziz Ansari in a Go-Nowhere Fargo The only entertainment value viewers can mine from this Grand Rapids mishigas is to meet the film on its own sub-basement level and count the movie references By Richard Corliss Aug. 11 2011 Share Read Later Columbia TristarJesse Eisenberg and Aziz Ansari star in a scene from Columbia Pictures 30 Minutes or Less Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Some weeks back movie-house managers reported that a significant percentage of customers seeing Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life had stormed out of the theaters early and demanded their money back. Malicks offense was to include early in the film a 17-minute segment encapsulating the history of the cosmos in glorious often abstract imagery; it baffled and thus angered many moviegoers. Yet if the Malick movie had contained explicit violence or gross sexuality or obscene language or a Neanderthal view of women few patrons would have dared ask for a refund. Mind you most of those elements can be found in a slew of action films and bromances including some good ones. But when they are applied with a ponderous lack of purpose on both sides of the camera the result is 30Minutes or Less (thats how the title appears on screen) a low-aiming lower-achieving heist comedy that plays like those filler farces that run on Comedy Central between reruns of The Daily Show and Tosh 2.0 -- except you cant fast-forward or change the channel. For a soul-sucking 83 minutes youre trapped inside the films tiny ugly mind. If you detect the same note of betrayal that the Tree-haters felt its because 30Minutess star Jesse Eisenberg and its director Ruben Fleischer previously collaborated on Zombieland a smart funny genre comedy about a quartet of humans in an America overrun (or over-slow-walked) by the undead. Zombieland fans like me were hoping that Fleischer and Eisenberg would bring the same cool brio to the buddy-caper genre. But no. The film has the feel of a frat-house improv attempted by guys whove done too much weed. Early in the game you will try to get on 30Minutess coarse lazy vibe and hope for something artless and insinuating -- the ""Louie Louie"" of movies. Even there you will meet disappointment. No matter how low you go the picture keeps tunneling deeper in a feat of cinematic onedownsmanship. (Read Richard Corliss review of Zombieland.) Say this for the plot devised by first-time screenwriters Michael Diliberti and Matthew Sullivan theres plenty of it. Nick (Eisenberg) an aimless 20something in Grand Rapids Mich. has two occupations driving a delivery van for Vitos Pizza and hanging with his OFF -- only friend forever -- Chet (Aziz Ansari from Parks and Recreation). It is the scripts lone innovation to take a familiar pair of birdbrained buddies and double the dose. Across town live two other slackers... losers... lackers... named Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson). Theyve hatched a scheme to murder Dwaynes semi-rich dad (Fred Ward) and open a combination tanning salon and hooker emporium. To get the 100000 needed to hire an assassin they kidnap Nick outfit him in a C4 vest and instruct him to rob a bank and get the loot back to them in 10 hours or less -- or else hes pureed pizza boy. The only entertainment value to be mined from this Grand Rapids mishigas is a bunch of not-bad inside-movie jokes -- as when the actor who played Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network disses Facebook by saying ""You know I dont check that shit out."" Later flailing in his attempts to defuse the C4 belt Nick wonders ""What did they do in The Hurt Locker?"" and Chet replies ""I dont know I didnt see it."" (The joke neither did anyone else.) So the lads imitate the bank heist from a Kathryn Bigelow movie they did see Point Break. Clogged as it with film references 30Minutes was likely inspired by a real tragedy. In 2003 a pizza delivery driver named Brian Wells died when a collar bomb he was wearing exploded during a bank heist in Eric Pa. Wells family doesnt think that filching the particulars of his death for a bromance farce is so very funny. And just last week the 18-year-old daughter of a Sydney Australia software zillionaire spent 10 harrowing hours chained in a vest she thought was studded with explosives before bomb-squad specialists freed her. (The vest turned out to be a sophisticated hoax and the police could not immediately locate the perp.) Im not saying that movie people cant rip a story from yesterdays headlines or for that matter rip it off in a quest for laughs. But theyd better be the kind of laughs that choke in your throat -- dark comedy with a bilious tinge. Thats what Joel and Ethan Coen were after in Fargo. The Brit iconoclast Chris Morris showed greater nerve last year with Four Lions a comedy about a team of crackpot jihadists from Manchester. 30Minutes though doesnt aspire to satires grand misanthropy; it simply straps the bomb plot to buddy-movie feel-bad fun -- sort of Zuck amp; Kumar Go to Pieces or Dwayne amp; Traviss Crapulous Misadventure. Even as a crime caper the movie misses the bold blend of behavioral comedy and explosive violence in George Armitages 1990 Miami Blues starring Ward as a detective and the young Alec Baldwin as a charming sociopath. I might urge TIME.com readers to go a multiplex this weekend sit through the movie for 30 minutes or less then leave en masse and demand a refund -- except that life is too short for such political theater. Anyhow the most frustrating aspect of this film is that its only amusing sequence comes in the very last minute after the closing credits with a mock commercial for Dwaynes tanning salon. That scene has the comic verve and performance elan missing from every earlier frame of 30Minutes of Less. But Id still rather watch the cosmic pyrotechnics and CGI dinosaurs of The Tree of Life. For that Id pay double. Read Richard Corliss review of Miami Blues. See a video of Jesse Eisenberg on pop culture.

Talk about downward mobility. Jesse Eisenberg has followed his Oscar- nominated role as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network"" with a low-budget slacker com edy that casts him as a pizza delivery boy forced into a bank robbery by having a bomb strapped to his chest. Loosely inspired by a real-life 2003 Pennsylvania case with a far less funny ending ""30 Minutes or Less"" may be tasteless moronic and lacking in any redeeming social value whatsoever. But for me at least it was gut-bustingly funny -- perhaps this waning summer seasons ultimate guilty pleasure. Made after ""The Social Network"" but before its release last fall Eisenbergs reunion with ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleischer has Eisenberg playing a vastly less smart character than Zuckerberg. The unemployed 30-something villains -- Danny McBride and Nick Swardson much funnier than usual -- literally order our dope-smoking hero up when they need a patsy to facilitate a breathtakingly idiotic money-making scheme. They need 100000 to pay a contract killer (Michael Pena) to bump off McBrides father (Fred Ward). When McBride inherits dads lottery winnings they plan to open the first brothel in Grand Rapids Mich. Wearing gorilla masks they call Eisenberg knock him out and put him in an explosive vest with a timer set to go off in 24 hours. When Eisenberg comes to they tell him theyll give him the code to disarm the vest if he robs the local bank for them. Warned not to contact the authorities or McBride will detonate the vest with a cellphone the terrified Eisenberg recruits his understandably reluctant roommate. Hes a lazy substitute teacher (Aziz Ansari) whos upset that Eisenberg has slept with Ansaris sister (Dilshad Vadsaria). The robbery itself is an amusing spoof of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" -- absent the pizza delivery and ""Attica Attica"" -- that the two bungling robbers somehow pull off much to their amazement. They manage to elude the cops in a well-staged chase. But getting the money to the bickering bad guys proves hilariously problematic. Running just 83 minutes with credits this movie moves like lightning -- and just barely manages to avoid wearing out its welcome. Fleischer deftly deploys his ensemble with Pena demonstrating a previously unsuspected comic flair and Bianca Kajlich also getting belly laughs as his prostitute girlfriend. McBride whose sometimes overbearing comic touch was most recently demonstrated in ""Your Highness"" is well teamed with Swardson a frequent Adam Sandler collaborator. Eisenbergs acting chops create suspense about his characters fate and even more important keep the film from veering entirely into silliness. Eisenberg has great chemistry with the equally manic Ansari best-known for TVs ""Parks and Recreation."" It may be petty larceny under the circumstances but Ansari pretty much steals ""30 Minutes or Less."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Sesame Street says Bert and Ernie are best friends -- do...

Starring Jesse Eisenberg Danny McBride Michael Pena Aziz Ansari Director Ruben Fleischer Release Opened Aug 12 2011  Editorial Review Dont waste your timeBy Ann HornadayFriday Aug 12 2011Ruben Fleischer made a promising directorial debut with the 2009 action comedy ""Zombieland"" which starred Jesse Eisenberg as a hapless student on an improbably amusing road trip to hell. That was before ""The Social Network"" though and beholding Eisenberg in Fleischers relentlessly vulgar and un-funny ""30 Minutes or Less"" is akin to watching a ring-tested champion punch far below his weight. What a comedown. Eisenberg plays Nick a pizza delivery guy who falls into a trap set by spoiled brat Dwayne (Danny McBride) to steal 100000 to pay off a hit man to assassinate Dwaynes rich father. With a bomb strapped to his chest and only a few hours to find the money Nick and his best friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) cut a manic destructive swath through Grand Rapids Mich. surviving a ballistic bank robbery and pulverizing car crash and ongoing patter about sex action flicks and sex. Like ""Horrible Bosses"" ""The Change-Up"" and ""The Hangover Part II"" ""30 Minutes or Less"" plays like this summers latest - and lamest - panegyric to male friendship. (Dwayne has a best friend too a bumbling toady played by the scene-stealing Nick Swardson.) Arriving in the dog days of mindless summer male-bonding blather this installment feels as stale as one of Nicks perpetually cold pizzas. Eisenbergs chilly diffidence only makes the screenwriters of ""30 Minutes or Less"" seem more cynical; McBride literally phones it in in long talky deadly-dull expository sequences. Would that ""30 Minutes or Less"" lived up to its title. Even under 90 it feels interminable.Contains crude and sexual content pervasive profanity nudity and some violence.

Photo Wilson Webb Columbia Tristar 30 Minutes or Less review Strange kind of humor 1 / 1 Back to Gallery 30 Minutes or Less Comedy. Starring Jesse Eisenberg Danny McBride and Nick Swardson. Directed by Ruben Fleischer. (R. 83 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""30 Minutes or Less"" is a strange case. Either it goes for a particular tone and doesnt achieve it. Or it does achieve a tone thats not really worth striving for. Its a comedy - at least it assumes the attitude and atmosphere of one. The characters are frantic and outlandish the situations are extreme and nothing is to be taken seriously. Yet almost at every turn the movie is ugly. No ""30 Minutes"" is not a black comedy - a black comedy usually presents a deliberately exaggerated world which comments on a real condition. But this movie has no satiric intention at all. Instead over the course of a lighthearted romp about a guy who gets strapped to a bomb were presented with about a half dozen horrible people not as a commentary but with the idea that this is what folks are really like and isnt that funny. To some degree it is funny but more often ""30 Minutes"" is funny in the sense of ""strange."" Its also reasonably watchable and not boring. But ... yecch. Related Stories Review 30 Minutes or Less Jesse Eisenberg is a pizza delivery guy who is going nowhere with his life. The guys not as obnoxious as the Mark Zuckerberg character was in ""The Social Network"" but not as nervous and innocuous as Eisenberg usually is. Danny McBride as a creep in his 30s is even worse off. He decides with a friend (Nick Swardson) to kill his own father (Fred Ward) to get a 2 million inheritance. But first he needs money so he and his partner strap a bomb to the pizza guy and tell him to rob a bank - or blow up. Eisenberg has the ability to make being strapped to a bomb almost amusing and also to play the situation for truth so that you believe his predicament and wish him all the best. The banter between him and Aziz Ansari who plays his best friend is frenetic and authentic - really the best thing in the movie. But every other major element borders on distasteful and disturbing. For example director Ruben Fleischer gets us ready to laugh and then shows a character getting murdered. Perhaps this could have been interesting but not in the way its done here. Fleischer isnt playing with our expectations or expanding his movies range just swinging wild and knocking over the furniture - or in this case the genre. Gradually we come to realize that the would-be criminal mastermind played by McBride is not someone really to laugh at. He is sick and evil and yet there is little indication that the filmmakers know it too. Perhaps they think he is sick and evil and funny. But no. By the way the tonal strangeness may not be the result of an experiment but simply the case of a marriage between a subject and an attitude that never really took. ""30 Minutes or Less"" is very loosely based on an incident that occurred in Pennsylvania eight years ago in which a pizza delivery guy blew up and the perpetrators were sent to prison for long stretches. It didnt seem like the stuff of comedy then. Still doesnt. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

By Wilson Webb Columbia Pictures Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) and Chet (Aziz Ansari) are caught up in a plot to rob a bank -- and a bomb is ticking away. EnlargeClose By Wilson Webb Columbia Pictures Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) and Chet (Aziz Ansari) are caught up in a plot to rob a bank -- and a bomb is ticking away. Where that bawdy stoner comedy was outlandishly silly it also had a sweetness in its believable buddy relationship. But 30 Minutes wallows in stupidity without making the bromance bonds believable. Manic and mean-spirited its a movie that wastes the talents of its stars with feeble jokes and a wobbly plot. Blending careening car chases and outrageous often offensive humor it barrels through a litany of action-flick cliches. Underachieving pizza delivery guy Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) gets randomly selected as a pawn by bumbling slackers Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson). Their plan is to hire a hit man to kill Dwaynes overbearing ex-Marine father known as ""The Major"" (Fred Ward) so his son can inherit the millions his old man won in the lottery. Dwaynes big ambition is to use the money to start up a house of ill repute/tanning salon. Nick is the patsy they kidnap to drum up the 100000 that Dwayne and Travis need to pay the hired assassin (Michael Pena). The duo drug Nick and strap a vest outfitted with a bomb to his chest. Panicked in the ultra-neurotic way that Eisenberg does well Nick enlists his slightly more industrious buddy Chet (Aziz Ansari) to help him rob a bank. The two bicker fend off police and dodge dyed bank bills as well as the scary hired killer -- all while the bomb timer ticks down. About the movie 30 Minutes or Less   out of fourStars Jesse Eisenberg Danny McBride Aziz Ansari Nick Swardson Michael Pe?a Fred Ward Director Ruben Fleischer Distributor Sony Pictures Rating R for crude and sexual content pervasive language nudity and some violenceRunning time 1 hour 23 minutes Opens Friday nationwide This was a move in the wrong direction for nearly all concerned but particularly for Eisenberg whose performance in The Social Network was so hauntingly impeccable. Here hes a cipher who makes a series of bad choices. Pena so nuanced in Crash and World Trade Center is saddled with a stereotypical role as an ex-con assassin. He brings an eccentricity to his character and provides some of the movies funniest moments. Director Ruben Fleischers debut film was the much more wickedly clever comedy Zombieland which also starred Eisenberg. Despite its extreme premise the plot is loosely based on an actual incident in 2003 of a Pennsylvania pizza delivery guy who had a bomb strapped around his neck. There is inherent dark humor in the concept in the same subversive way that the Coen brothers made wood-chippers funny in Fargo. But the idea in 30 Minutes or Less is handled clumsily and comes off like just another foul-mouthed frenetic buddy action comedy. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Instead this slackers-go-gangsta comedy demonstrates that less than 90 minutes can be a very long time. The story begins at full speed as pizza-delivery guy Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) rushes to an address he knows he cant reach in the half hour his employer requires. Soon Nicks high-velocity antics will be motivated by something more urgent than a 30-minutes-or-free guarantee. Two witless thugs will strap a bomb to him and threaten to detonate it if Nick doesnt bring them 100000. This setup was inspired by the less-than-hilarious case of Brian Wells a pizza deliverer who died in an explosion after trying to rob a bank while wearing a bomb. In embroidering that real-life incident director Ruben Fleischer and screenwriter Michael Diliberti have devised a tiresomely elaborate backstory. Grand Rapids lowlife Dwayne (Danny McBride) is impatient to inherit whats left of the 10 million his crusty ex-Marine dad (Fred Ward) won in the Michigan lottery. Dwaynes murder consultant -- a local stripper -- suggests he hire a hitman. She knows just the guy her sometime boyfriend Chango (Michael Pena). But Chango requires 100000 upfront. Dwayne and his equally dim buddy Travis (Nick Swardson) know how to get that kind of money knock over a bank. But theyd rather not do it themselves. So they kidnap Nick lock a bomb vest on him and order him to deliver the 100 Gs in 10 hours. Nick turns for help to his only friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) an Indian-American grade-school teacher with whom he happens to be feuding. Chet reluctantly agrees to aid Nick and soon find himself wearing a ski mark and brandishing a toy gun. Along the way Chets twin sister Kate (Dilshad Vadsaria) is pulled into the plot to the two pals horror. Nicks longstanding crush on Kate is one reason hes been squabbling with Chet. As the first pair of doofuses tangles with the second Chango arrives in town. Hes ready for his cash and he has a gun. But Travis whose explosives-savant status is never explained has a flame-thrower. i Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson) are two lowlifes trying to raise the money to sic a hitman on Dwaynes rich father. Inexplicably the otherwise dim bulbs are quite adept at rigging explosive devices to people. Wilson Webb/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Wilson Webb/Sony Pictures Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson) are two lowlifes trying to raise the money to sic a hitman on Dwaynes rich father. Inexplicably the otherwise dim bulbs are quite adept at rigging explosive devices to people. Wilson Webb/Sony Pictures Fleischer directed Eisenberg in Zombieland but the two dont demonstrate any rapport here. The actor is halting and off-rhythm as are most of the other performers. The cast rarely finds a plausible way to deliver the Tarantino-meets-Apatow dialogue a stew of tough-guy swagger and bromantic bawdy chatter. The principal exception is Pena who commits utterly to his Chicano-stereotype role and actually pulls some laughs from it. 30 Minutes or Less would be somewhat more entertaining if the frequent car-chase scenes were better staged and the song choices werent so obvious. Apparently the filmmakers thought that using tunes associated with other movies like Beverly Hills Cops ""The Heat is On"" would confuse viewers into thinking they were watching an action-comedy classic. A modestly amusing sketch featuring several of the movies characters follows the end credits. But the odds are better than 30-to-one that theaters will be entirely empty before this bonus begins.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint How disappointing to see Oscar-nominated Jesse Eisenberg and his ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleischer reunited in a low-rent slob comedy. Eisenberg swallows his sparky intelligence to play Nick a pizza delivery guy whose defining character trait is NASCAR-level driving skill. He meets a fate worse than being stiffed for a tip when a delivery to an abandoned scrapyard puts him in the clutches of knuckleheads Duane and Travis (Danny McBride and Nick Swardson) who strap him into an explosive vest and send him off to rob a bank. If hes not back with 100000 in 10 hours kaboom pizza guy will be a splatter of tomato sauce. With nowhere else to turn Nick recruits his grade-school teacher friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) to help him with the heist. They bumble through the caper with sheer bluster and bravado much the same way Eisenberg and Ansari handle Michael Dilibertis subliterate script. The film is like something the Three Stooges would have done if they had Tourettes syndrome. The latest in this summers dispiriting run of R-rated comedies this proves again that laughs cannot live on profanity alone. If you think the comedic potential of an explosive vest is limited youre right. The film is a sour and mean-spirited experience with characters shot pistol-whipped and graphically incinerated. This is ostensibly designed to be painfully funny. Its just painful. This film runs a limping 83 minutes but even at 30 minutes or less it would outstay its welcome. This film puts audiences in the hurt locker. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

He plays a pizza delivery dude a college dropout and the girl he likes is talking about Facebook. ""You know I dont do that"" he responds. ""Im off the grid."" More about 30 Minutes or Less >> This from the guy who was nominated for a best-actor Oscar for his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg the whiz-kid founder of Facebook in The Social Network. Thats about as smart as it gets in 30 Minutes or Less an action comedy that appears to have been shot in a stoner haze - a canned sliced-up Pineapple Express. Eisenberg is Nick he delivers pies for Vitos Pizza in Grand Rapids Mich. and he has a thing for his best friends twin sister. This upsets his friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) who thinks Nick having sex with his twin is ickily close to having sex with him so the two buds have a falling out. But that lasts only long enough for another pair of best bros - a lowlife named Dwayne (Danny McBride) and his even dimmer sidekick Travis (Nick Swardson) - to come up with a plot to get the pizza delivery kid to rob a bank for them. How? By strapping a time bomb to Nicks chest and threatening to blow him up if he doesnt come back with at least 100000. Why? Because its less risky than doing the heist themselves and anyway they have bigger plans They need the money to hire a hit man to kill Dwaynes dad. Hes a lottery-winner millionaire and a complete jerk and Dwayne wants his inheritance before its all gone. The exotic dancer he frequents Juicy gave him the idea. With its careening crash-and-burn car chases and unexpectedly dark turns 30 Minutes or Less directed by Ruben Fleischer had the potential to achieve a kind of Coen Brothers-ish mix of the madcap and the menacing. But such lofty goals (if indeed anyone had them) are squandered by a surfeit of sloppy R-rated jokes and stupid-with-a-capital-S comedy. McBride is the poster boy for such fare but his shtick is getting tired even when he tosses around a word like euphemism. (Hes explaining to his stripper gal pal what ""polish my royal scepter"" really means.) Eisenberg (who starred in director Fleischers far better Zombieland) does his usual Eisenbergian thing more slacker and less hacker but still hitting the same notes. And Ansari squawks and yelps like a parrot with a grudge. Dilshad Vadsaria is the perfectly pleasant twin Kate and Michael Pena seems to be having a good time as the killer-for-hire Chango. 30 Minutes or Less takes its title from the promise of Nicks pizza company If you dont get your order within the advertised time the pie is free. The movie claims to be only 83 minutes long but its the longest 83 minutes to come along in quite awhile. Expect a few folks to ask for their money back.

By    Alonso Duralde on August 11 2011  1011 am Follow aduralde Email Print Related 30 Minutes or Less Blasted by Pizza Bombers Sister Jesse Eisenberg Delivers in 30 Minutes or Less Trailer (Video) Glee 3D Concert Movie Songs for Gleeks Cleavage for Straight Guys The Jesse Eisenberg/Ruben Fleisher heist farce is as familiar and phoned-in as their ""Zombieland"" was fresh and innovative You know the old saying about how pizza and sex are pretty good even when theyre lousy? Unfortunately the rule doesnt apply to the pizza-guy-turned-bank-robber comedy ""30 Minutes or Less"" which remains a lazy and listless caper farce despite the presence of comedy heavy-hitters like Jesse Eisenberg Danny McBride and Aziz Ansari. Eisenberg unsuccessfully cast against type stars as Nick a slacker whose go-nowhere life revolves around smoking pot and delivering pizza for a shabby franchise that promises youll get your pepperoni-and-cheese-thin-crust within half an hour. One of his deliveries takes him to a construction site where two gorilla-masked men chloroform him and strap a bomb to his chest telling him hes got nine hours to rob a bank. The apes in question are Dwayne (McBride) a doofus who wants to raise money to hire a hit man to kill Dwaynes dad (Fred Ward) for his lottery winnings and Travis (Nick Swardson) who despite being Dwaynes submissive lackey is the relative brainiac of the operation thanks to his skill for making things like bombs and flamethrowers. (You could imagine Travis hanging out with the motorheads from ""Bellflower."") The only person to whom Nick can turn for help is Chet (Aziz Ansari) and thats a little awkward since the two lifelong best friends stopped speaking to each other the night before. (Chet revealed hed accidentally helped break up Nicks parents marriage; Nick admitted he slept with Chets twin sister Kate played by Dilshad Vadsaria the night of their high-school graduation.) Despite the controversy erupting over the fact that ""30 Minutes"" may or may not be borrowing heavily from a tragic real-life incident the film presents a farcical set-up that has the potential to be funny. And while we get an occasional a chuckle or two this movie careens along lacking any wit or even momentum. (For a movie centered around a ticking time bomb the pace is unforgivably slack.) Also read 30 Minutes or Less Blasted by Pizza Bombers Sister The only consistent laughs come from Michael Penas eccentric hired killer the movies one character who seems like someone we havent seen a million times before. Penas off-kilter timing and funny vocal inflections make him the movies high point making his frequent absences from the action that much more disappointing. Actresses like Halle Berry get a hard time for following up their Academy Award wins with dopey movies so its only fair to point out that Eisenbergs a follow-up to his Oscar-nominated role in ""The Social Network"" represents a significant dip in quality. Its understandable perhaps that hed want to reteam with his ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleisher but this time Eisenbergs playing a much less interesting character -- and giving a much less interesting performance. Ansaris manic comic energy peps up a handful of scenes but the ""Parks and Recreation"" star handles his freak-out soliloquies (which probably provide more opportunities for improv) better than straightforward lines of expository dialogue where he sometimes seems to be choking on the words. Danny McBride it may not shock you to learn is playing an arrogant white-trash idiot whos all talk and bluster with nothing to back it up; in other words the same role hes played in pretty much everything hes ever done. Fleishers directorial debut ""Zombieland"" succeeded precisely because it was such a clever spin on a tired genre -- the fact that Eisenbergs character had survived because of his anal-retentive attention to detail gave zombie movies a fresh neurotic twist. (Featuring one of the great secret celebrity cameos of all time didnt hurt either.) Fleisher does the exact opposite with ""30 Minutes"" populating the film with stale flat crushingly familiar characters. Much of the blame should go to writers Michael Diliberti and Matthew Sullivan granted but Fleisher ploddingly puts these cardboard cut-outs through their paces. The cinematography in a would-be goofy comedy is rarely worth mentioning but it bears pointing out that director of photography Jess Hall sucks out what little joy ""30 Minutes"" might otherwise have. The dank gloomy look of the film suggests an indie drama about urban depressives or a documentary about factory closures not a ticking-clock caper farce. Theres at least one way that the audience will relate to these barely-there characters -- Eisenberg spends most of the movie looking at a digital clock to see how long hes got before hes released from an awful fate and viewers will do likewise.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> OK Im drifting. The facts Jesse Eisenberg goes crazy cuckoo but will not win an Oscar nod like he did for The Social Network as Nick a pizza guy who delivers in 30 minutes or less. Promises are forgotten as two scuzzballs immortally scuzzed by Nick Swardson and Danny McBride strap a bomb on Nick and force him to rob a bank. The plot is (very) loosely based on a real case with tragic consequences. The movie is just an excuse for laughs that come fast fat and raunchy as Nick mixes it up with Chet (hilarious Aziz Ansari) a teacher whos Nicks bestie except when Nick confesses his erotic cravings for Chets sister. The bomb? Fleischer isnt much on details. Its all about the zigzagging rush of the ride. Fair trade.

(Wilson Webb/Sony/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday August 11 2011 333 PM Title 30 Minutes or Less Comedy about two bored friends forced into crime. With Jesse Eisenberg Aziz Ansari. Director Ruben Fleischer (123). R language drugs violence. At area theaters. A darkly comic underachiever that manages to charm almost in spite of itself Ruben Fleischers ""30 Minutes or Less"" is probably best watched as it was made without much evident effort. In other words wait until it hits DVD order a pizza and Netflix it.But if youre bored or curious or merely looking to get out of the house its just enough fun to make a 12 ticket worth your while.Most of the credit goes to Jesse Eisenberg and Aziz Ansari as slacker buds Nick and Chet. A deliveryman with little ambition beyond scamming extra tips Nick is forced to take charge when hes kidnapped by Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson).Having decided he wants to kill his cruel father (Fred Ward) Dwayne needs 100000 for an assassin (scene-stealer Michael Pena). So he and the equally inept Travis strap a bomb to Nicks chest and order him to go rob a bank. With the bomb already ticking an energized Nick grabs Chet and begins making the first decisive plans of his life.Carelessly shot with a spur-of-the-moment feel ""30 Minutes"" has more in common with stoner comedies like ""Pineapple Express"" than Fleischers comparatively ambitious ""Zombieland."" (The filmmakers claim they were unaware of a 2003 news story that parallels the movies primary plot.)While McBride barely varies his familiar clueless-moron persona Eisenbergs laid-back attitude is deceptive. It takes effort to engage an audience and run a full range of emotions while playing a character whod prefer to remain perpetually bored. And while Ansaris job is easier he provides strong--and often hilarious--support as another dude who resents being woken from a lifelong sleep. Michael Dilibertis jokey screenplay meshes perfectly with the leads low-key approach continually lulling us into near-apathy before delivering each new and surprisingly clever wake-up call. But ultimately your participation in their ambling adventure will come down to this do you really have anything better to do?Magic Moment Watching the guys pull off a heist based entirely on lessons theyve learned from movies.

"30 Minutes or Less movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 30 Minutes or Less a half-and-half comedyWhen good its very goodbut when bad its awful -- 2 1/2 starsAugust 11 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJesse Eisenberg and Aziz Ansari star in ""30 Minutes or Less.""Fast cheap and out of control and set in glamorous Grand Rapids Mich. director Ruben Fleischers ""30 Minutes or Less"" doesnt even crack the 80-minute mark if you exclude the end credits. The same was true of Fleischers feature film debut the very funny ""Zombieland"" which contained more visual wit and kinetic energy than most action comedies were seeing lately. Fleischer and his editor Alan Baumgarten have complementary senses of humor; they know how to cut for maximum punctuation as well as how to cut to the chase.Roughly half of this film works a lot better than roughly the other half. Crisscrossing between two sets of combustible bromances the story pivots on Nick played by Jesse Eisenberg who delivers pizzas for a living. His buddy Chet played by Aziz Ansari teaches elementary school and has a twin sister (Dilshad Vadsaria) who is the love of Nicks semblance of a life.On the other side of town meanwhile wastrel sociopath Dwayne (Danny McBride) and his minion Travis (Nick Swardson) plan to kill Dwaynes mean rich father (Fred Ward) for inheritance money. They need a hostage to rob a bank (?? Oh whatever) to come up with 100000 to pay the hit man (an amusingly sinister Michael Pena). The pizza boy-man presents a ripe stooge indeed and for most of ""30 Minutes or Less"" Nick against his increasingly panicky will runs around with explosives strapped to his chest while the criminals alternately threaten his extinction and hang out at strip clubs or taco shops dreaming of their future.When the comedy works it really works. The scene in which congenitally timid and generally law-abiding Nick and Chet go gangsta and get into the 80s action-movie spirit of their first foray into bank robbery charges hard and builds cleverly. Fleischer locates an effective mixture of jokes and violence here; elsewhere the mixture is less sure of itself. The most jarring sequences recall the bits in ""Pineapple Express"" that mistook easy brutality for comic realism.""30 Minutes or Less"" may be too jarring period for most people. Its based loosely on a fatal 2003 Erie Pa. incident involving a pizza deliveryman a set of explosives and a group of bank robbers with whom he may or may not have colluded. The film has no interest in following the grim events of what actually happened. Even so This is one comedy built on one hell of a queasy-making premise.The other drawback here has two names ""Danny"" and ""McBride."" I dont know how much more Danny McBride I can take in this sort of hostile lummox role and each time the story flies off Nick and Chet and lands back with Dwayne and Travis its like a flat tire going flupp-flupp-flupp. Screenwriter Michael Diliberti has talent and some of his funny lines are actually f-word-free as when Nick argues with Chet about being ready for a serious adulthood and Chet replies with ""You? An adult? You had a Lunchables for dinner"" Eisenbergs deadpan precision works well with Ansaris wide-eyed wonder at the life of crime hes suddenly leading. The movie ends up being just sharp enough at its peaks to be frustrating in its valleys. But the laughs are there.mjphillipstribune.com30 Minutes or Less -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for crude and sexual content pervasive language nudity and some violence)Cast Jesse Eisenberg (Nick); Aziz Ansari (Chet); Danny McBride (Dwayne); Nick Swardson (Travis); Michael Pena (Chango); Fred Ward (The Major); Bianca Kajlich (Juicy); Dilshad Vadsaria (Kate)Credits Directed by Ruben Fleischer; written by Michael Diliberti; produced by Stuart Cornfeld Ben Stiller and Jeremy Kramer.

(AP Photo/Sony-Columbia Pictures Wilson Webb) The idea for ""30 Minutes or Less"" seems like it was cooked up in half an hour by two guys with the munchies A pizza-delivery guy is outfitted with a bomb and forced to rob a bank. Something similar actually happened once but the result wasnt funny. Neither is ""30 Minutes or Less"" although it smirks like it thinks so.Oscar nominee Jesse Eisenberg returning a favor for ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleischer plays the hapless foil in the plot a dimwitted delivery boy named Nick who works for a pizza parlor in Grand Rapids Mich.At the end of his shift one day Nick is lured to the junkyard lair of Dwayne and Travis (Danny McBride and Nick Swardson). Dwayne is a scheming scumbag who wants to kill his ex-soldier dad (Fred Ward) for an inheritance that Dwayne can use to open a combination tanning salon and brothel. But to hire hit man Chango (Michael Pena) Dwayne needs 100000. So pea-brained pyromaniac Travis straps a bomb on Nick and points him in the direction of the nearest bank. Did you catch all of that?To make matters more insufferable the patsy is just as dumb as the plotters. Instead of simply calling the cops bomb-belted Nick seeks help from his estranged best friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) who is working as a substitute teacher and whose sister (Dilshad Vadsaria) has jilted Nick for being a deadbeat.Although Chet is smart enough to be afraid of a bomb in a crowded school hes dumb enough to join and plan the bank robbery which entails buying ski masks from a dollar store and stealing a getaway car from a neighbor whos known Nick and Chet since they were kids. This cheesy movie piles one dicey gag on top of another but the dough-brained script and flat direction never rise to the challenge.""30 Minutes or Less"" could have been a guilty pleasure but the crusty caper is half baked.

Had high hopes for this movie. I was incredibly surprised by Zombieland and was thrilled to hear Eisenberg was re-teaming with the director. I always defend Eisenberg when people tell me he is the same in every movie. I tell them that ""awkward"" Eisenberg in Zombieland is different than the ""awkward"" Eisenberg in The Squid and the Whale. Im bummed to hear he isnt impressive in this film.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet 30 Minutes Or Less could mark the unveiling of a new generation of comedy heroes who get called upon to salvage unsalvageable scripts and redeem seemingly irredeemably slim material. Its the kind of featherweight trifle Owen Wilson might have been called upon to try to rescue six years ago. Today Jesse Eisenberg--and to a lesser extent Aziz Ansari Danny McBride and Nick Swardson--are the doomed souls cursed with trying to wring laughs from a vast comic desert. An egregiously miscast Eisenberg stars as a young man toiling as a pizza boy even though he displays only slightly less intelligence and savvy than the world-beater Eisenberg played in The Social Network. (Eisenberg cant/doesnt/wont play dumb.) His sad-sack existence goes from bad to worse when McBride and Swardson abduct him then force him to rob a bank to raise money to hire an assassin to kill McBrides lottery-winner Marine dad (Fred Ward). McBride may be the worlds most indirect criminal mastermind He cant be bothered to rob or kill so he sends intermediaries out on his behalf. Ansari costars as Eisenbergs best friend and reluctant partner in crime. Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) sometimes seems to be aiming for a meta-meditation on cheesy 1980s action comedies or commenting on the insanely convoluted nature of thriller plots. A film that climaxes with a trade-off in a junkyard has a rich appreciation for the cliches of the action-comedy genre but 30 Minutes Or Less is ultimately so muddled and slight thats its hard to ascertain what the filmmakers were thinking. For starters they cant seem to decide how straight to play the genre elements or McBrides villainy. The films tonal shifts can be jarring 30 Minutes Or Less has an agreeably shaggy ramshackle vibe and a nice feel for life among the desperate and bored in Grand Rapids Michigan but when McBride and Swardson wear monkey masks to menace Eisenberg its so disturbing it stops the comedys halting momentum cold. For the sake of verisimilitude 30 Minutes Or Less at one point sticks Swardsons dopey broke Michigan schmuck in an Insane Clown Posse jersey a nice bit of local color that suggests the costume designer put more thought into that one tiny-but-telling detail than the screenwriters did into the whole film.

(AP Photo/Sony-Columbia Pictures Wilson Webb)-- AP+Read Caption In this film publicity image released by Sony Pictures Aziz Danny McBride left and Nick Swardson are shown in Columbia Pictures ""30 Minutes or Less."" (AP Photo/Sony-Columbia Pictures Wilson Webb) / APShare Photo If this has indeed been The Summer of the R-Rated Comedy with each new movie striving to one-up its predecessors in getting down and dirty then were going out with a whimper with ""30 Minutes or Less."" And thats ironic given that the movie is all about something - or someone - going out with a bang. From the phoned-in (""The Hangover Part II"") to the fantastic (""Bridesmaids"") ""30 Minutes or Less"" falls somewhere in the mushy midsection. Like ""Horrible Bosses"" its got a shaggy sloppy vibe and characters who are in way over their heads but its not nearly as consistently funny. Its actually got more in common with the ""The Change-Up"" in that its frustratingly uneven despite some appealing moments of buddy camaraderie. Jesse Eisenberg leads the idiocy - and thats part of the problem. Eisenberg is at his best when hes the smartest guy in the room when hes struggling to stifle his inability to suffer fools as in his Oscar-nominated performance in ""The Social Network"" or even in films that have allowed him to show some more insecurity like ""The Squid and the Whale"" or ""Zombieland"" (which like ""30 Minutes or Less"" came from director Ruben Fleischer). Here hes one of the fools himself as Nick a slacker/stoner/pizza delivery guy whose only ambition in life is to get an order to its destination in a half-hour or less hence the title. Not that punctuality is a source of pride for him; rather if he doesnt make it in time the customer gets the pizza for free and the cost comes out of his paycheck. His best friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) is vaguely more useful in that hes an elementary school teacher but hes still sort of a goof-off (which calls to mind yet another of the summers R-rated comedies ""Bad Teacher""). The other pair of pals in ""30 Minutes or Less"" consists of the flat-out doofuses played by Danny McBride and Nick Swardson. McBrides Dwayne hates his disdainful Marine father (Fred Ward) and dreams of proving himself by opening a tanning salon thats a front for a brothel. With some inspiration from a stripper named Juicy (Bianca Kajlich) and some help from Swardsons worshipful Travis whos obsessed with explosive devices Dwayne cooks up a scheme to kill his dad and thereby inherit the old mans millions in lottery winnings. But first Dwayne needs 100000 to pay the hit man (Michael Pena as an amusingly over-the-top ethnic stereotype). So he cooks up another scheme to order a pizza then kidnap and place a bomb on the poor schmo delivery guy and force him to rob a bank or else hell blow the guy up. None of this crackles with the kind of breezy madcap hilarity that it should; its actually rather tortured and convoluted. Merely trying to explain what the plot was about just now was arduous. Similarly everyone feels as if theyre straining here trapped in their one-note roles and they probably wouldnt have had to work so hard if there were more to the script from Michael Diliberti. It almost feels as if ""30 Minutes or Less"" were constructed from a random assortment of wild and raunchy ideas words on notecards like ""hooker"" ""stripper"" ""gay slurs"" ""flamethrower"" ""adultery with a lifeguard"" and ""fellatio in a car."" It feels way longer than its brief running time not just because of its stop-and-start pacing but also because it looks so drab and dingy its really unpleasant to watch. Even actors as delightfully odd and fearless as McBride and Swardson who have their moments cant make this thing explode off the screen.

Cast Jesse Eisenberg Danny McBride Nick Swardson. Rating R for crude and sexual content pervasive language nudity and some violence. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Or can be. That distinction is important because the film wallows in such abject stupidity for big chunks of time that the talents of such actors as Jesse Eisenberg Aziz Ansari Danny McBride and Nick Swardson are largely wasted. Not completely so - there are laughs here and there because with this bunch thats inevitable. McBride and Swardson in particular are just so . . . wrong in so many of their roles so gleefully demented that they bring that history with them. Just looking at them standing there is often worth a chuckle. But director Ruben Fleischer who directed Eisenberg in the worlds-better ""Zombieland"" never finds that kind of successful groove here instead bouncing from one set piece to another with vastly inconsistent results. Its not his fault entirely; the script by Michael Diliberti doesnt give him or his actors much to work with. Nick (Eisenberg) is the standard-issue movie slacker delivering pizzas and not doing much else. (His company promises delivery within 30 minutes or less. Thus the title.) His best friend Chet (Ansari) has actually managed to secure a job as a substitute teacher which in this crowd practically qualifies him for Nobel consideration. Meanwhile we have Dwayne (McBride) a mean-spirited dope who detests his father (Fred Ward) a former Marine who won the lottery. Dwayne gets the idea from a stripper writhing on his lap that he should knock off his father and collect the inheritance to start his own lame-brained business venture. His idiot friend Travis (Swardson) agrees and they decide to hire a hit man (Michael Pena) to carry out the messy end of the business. First though they need 100000. Where to find it where to find it? Ah - rob a bank. But too lazy to do anything themselves they figure its work best done by someone else. So they order a pizza from Nicks shop and kidnap him when he arrives. Evidently not just an idiot but an idiot savant when it comes to explosives Travis rigs a bomb vest and locks Nick into it. Rob the bank get the money to them or BOOM (If this sounds somewhat familiar a pizza deliveryman in Pennsylvania was kidnapped and made to rob a bank in 2003. The collar exploded killing the man. The studio has said that the film is not based on the event but that writers were ""vaguely familiar"" with it.) Somewhere along the way Chet learns of Nicks feelings for his sister (Dilshad Vadsaria) which complicates things a bit if such a situation could become even more complicated. Everything that can go wrong pretty much does - explosively so. Yes thats a hint. But not necessarily in the way youd think. Eisenberg is a really good actor as he proves in his Oscar-nominated turn in ""The Social Network."" But even good actors are no match for lesser material. And unlike his costars Eisenberg is not intrinsically a comedian so he is more dependent than they are on good lines. He simply doesnt get enough. The best bits in fact come when McBride and Swardson either improvise or simply nail tossed-off asides - insane profane riffing that can make for some really funny bits but doesnt add up to a really funny (or successful) movie. Its tempting to muse that ""30 Minutes or Less"" could have been more what with the talent involved. But the opposite is probably true - the talent involved is what saves it from disaster a half-baked idea carried farther forward than it should have been.

Why? Because a scheming dum-dum named Dwayne (Danny McBride) needs 100000 to pay a hitman (Michael Pena) to ice the dum-dums sadistic ex-Marine father (Fred Ward) so the good-for-nothing Dwayne can inherit Dads dough and Nicks the unlucky SOB Dwayne kidnaps and forces to do his criminal bidding. Why? Well because this stuff happens sometimes as it did to a real Pennsylvania pizza guy under similar circumstances back in 2003. (The outcome wasnt pretty.) Now on to a harder question How does such a warped premise -- with real no-joke life-and-death consequences built into the suspense -- become a movie thats weirdly funny and fast-paced not to mention determinedly mean filthy and jackass irresponsible? To which my answer is I dont know; 30 Minutes shouldnt work. But it does. A stoner movie without the spliff smoke its proudly sexually lewd with no cushion of boyish sweetness. (Ah the invaluable Danny McBride touch) Theres plenty of male-on-male insults amiably amped up because Dwaynes doofus ""bomb expert"" sidekick is played by crazy-comic Nick Swardson and Nicks ex?best friend (who nevertheless helps out under the circumstances) is played by Parks and Recreations notable Aziz Ansari. The script a hot commodity by Michael Diliberti from a story by Diliberti and Matthew Sullivan barrels along on sharp-tongued gusts of outrage -- and one great joke at the expense of The Hurt Locker. And the ensemble cast led by a whirlybirding Eisenberg (whose character actually says ""I dont check Facebook"" hah) charges ahead steered by director Ruben Fleischer with some of the same daredevil balancing acts he (and Eisenberg) displayed in Zombieland. Theres nothing nice about 30 Minutes or Less. Its got no redeeming social value. It just ticks away exploding all notions of where you think its going to go. It blew me sideways.

Does the depressed consumer class even expect companies to make good on their advertised word anymore? But maybe the dream of free slices scammed from over-promising pizza parlors springs eternal. At least thats the game being run on Jesse Eisenbergs downtrodden delivery boy Nick at the beginning of Ruben Fleischers hyper-manic 30 Minutes or Less--a comedy that knows it has to move with all due dispatch to keep from disappointing the customer.When red light-running Nick arrives late at his delivery the pre-diabetic kids at the door refuse to dispense even a tip and so Nick has to dupe them in turn to get paid. He manages this by offering to buy them beer pocketing twice the cost of the food while swearing on his honor to return. The coup de grace comes when Nick asks if the boys like ODouls. ""We love that shit"" they gush as Nick departs. Thus is a balance of trade established within the movie scam or be scammed.Meantime on another narrative path Danny McBride and Nick Swardson play Dwayne and Travis a duo of even older going-nowhere types who on the advice of a stripper decide to off ""The Major""-- Dwaynes hard-ass Lotto-winning ex-Marine of a dad--and live off the inheritance. They settle on hiring the strippers hit man acquaintance. When she quotes an up-front price of 100000 Dwayne and Travis elect to raise the funds by kidnapping a patsy strapping him into a C4-studded vest and giving him 10 hours to rob a bank. In approximately 30 minutes Nick becomes that patsy.Despite its broad resemblance to a true-crime story there are nearly 1 million logical leaps made in the course of setting up this Rube Goldberg device of a plot--but watching the film clear each one becomes its own goofy pleasure. Completing the quartet of comic leads is Aziz Ansari as Nicks estranged friend Chet who even after learning that Nick deflowered his twin sister Kate during some long-ago graduation night needs little persuasion before ditching his job for an impromptu bank heist. In one hilarious bit (that feels ad-libbed) Chet explains hes helping not for Nicks sake but because letting his ex-friend blow up might one day begin to affect his ""relationships with other people.""Had the movie committed to such an acerbic tone throughout it might have approached the inspired amorality of the Coen brothers. But instead Fleischer and co quickly retrench behind the emotional lines of standard-issue bro humor The man-boys cant communicate except by delivering kidney-punches and calling each other pussies and yet male bonding is still one of the scripts third-act goals. This sop to sentiment is disappointing from a movie that otherwise feels free to make a suicide vest into a comic device.Relationships with women arent exactly foremost in the filmmakers minds either. Were meant to believe that the experience of having a bomb affixed to his body makes Nick want a mature love with Kate after eight years of pretending their hookup never took place. Elsewhere were introduced to Chet in medias fellatio; Ansari gets his first laugh by squirming when the girl goes in for a post-climax kiss. If youre a female character in the post-Apatowian world youll take what you can get.Its the cashier at the Family Dollar store who trains the clearest eye on the boys gender politics when she asks if Nick and Chet want some condoms to go with their ski-masks and toy guns. (Protection is on her recommended-purchase list for men who are about to ""go rape."") Shes a character from a more dangerous comedy that never materializes. Like his latest Fleischers Zombieland borrowed plenty of genre tropes but paid them back with a self-aware wink. 30 Minutes or Less just takes the money and runs.

For a movie about four slackers ""30 Minutes or Less"" feels like its in an awfully big hurry to be over. Maybe thats because the characters -- a couple of dorks forced into robbing a bank by a couple of lowlifes too lazy to do it themselves -- arent much fun to be around forcing ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleischer to race through the action while shortchanging the double-barreled bromance at its core. Still as junk-food comedy goes ""Less"" packs a surprising number of laughs into its brisk running time suggesting decent theatrical prospects with sturdy homevid to follow. Nick (Jesse Eisenberg typecast as the uneasy white guy) hates his job which involves driving like a maniac as he tries to deliver pizzas within an impossibly tight ""30 minutes or less"" time frame. He doesnt get much sympathy from best friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) who seems to appreciate that Nicks loser lifestyle makes his own meager accomplishments look grown-up by comparison. As amigos go they dont have much in common apart from the fact that the best years of their lives are behind them and the next 24 hours are about to get a lot worse. Across town equally mismatched buddies Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson) have hatched an elaborate scheme that involves kidnapping a pizza guy strapping an explosive vest to his chest and ordering him to steal 100000. Not since ""Fargo"" has a get-rich-quick scheme spiraled so disastrously out of control so fast only unlike that film (with its phony ""true story"" claims) ""Less"" was clearly inspired by the stranger-than-fiction case of Brian Wells who attempted to rob a bank while wearing a collar bomb (and died after the device detonated). Seizing on the comic absurdity of the situation first-time writer Michael Diliberti fashions the preposterous backstory cops later uncovered into the basis for his screenplay Dwayne allows an exotic dancer (Bianca Kajlich) to talk him into ordering a hit on his own father (Fred Ward) but before he can get his hands on the old mans inheritance he needs to raise enough money to pay the assassin (Michael Pena). Rather than expose himself he decides to enlist the help of a hapless pizza jockey. Twisting the details into an irreverent comedy the way bad-taste enthusiast John Waters might the pic nevertheless lacks the wickedly anarchic flair of satires like ""Serial Mom"" and ""Cecil B. Demented."" Instead ""Less"" feels more like a watered-down and streamlined ""Pineapple Express"" with double that films McBride brio. Clocking in at a mercifully short 83 minutes pic spares us the endless ad-libbing but isnt nearly as tight as its title implies. Dwayne gives Nick 10 hours to knock over the bank -- plenty of time to enlist his shrill Indian pal steal a neighbors Datsun and stock up on all the necessary supplies (one of the funnier scenes involves trying not to attract suspicion while buying plastic guns ski masks and several 5-Hour Energy shots). The robbery itself proves to be an unexpected bonding experience for the duo who have been on uneasy terms the entire afternoon after Nick confessed to deflowering Chets twin sister (Dilshad Vadsaria). With women good only for objectifying in this testosterone-choked comedy Nick and Dwayne try to work out whatever deep-buried feelings they have for their respective guy buds. If his shouty shtick werent so grating Ansari might actually come off as endearing refusing to abandon his time-bomb-strapped friend. Meanwhile even without his usual mullet McBride has the white-trash buffoon routine cornered playing it up to such a degree auds cant help but sympathize with Swardsons put-upon accomplice. Pena is a scene-stealer taking an unfortunate Latino stereotype and giving it a twist of Jack Sparrow-like eccentricity while ""Greeks"" Vadsaria makes an unconvincing twin for Ansari evidently having inherited all the pretty genes but none of the funny ones. Theyre not a pleasant bunch to pass the time with which leaves you half-hoping that the vest would just detonate already. Pics casualties arent permanent anyway as demonstrated by an amusing bonus sketch that awaits those who sit through the end credits. Fleischer has switched d.p.s since ""Zombieland"" tapping ""Hot Fuzz"" lenser Jess Hall for the job. Like that film ""Less"" has trouble framing simple action yielding clumsy car chases that put the burden of generating excitement on the music and editing. As a result pic looks cheap and feels clipped -- a choice that may not be entirely accidental given the unscenic Michigan eyesores against which the film is set. 30 Minutes or LessProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures presentation in association with Media Rights Capital of a Red Hour production.

TWITTER Jesse Eisenberg stars as a pizza delivery guy caught up in a heist in Ruben Fleischers ""Zombieland"" follow-up. This has not been a good summer for the R-rated comedy which takes another hit with 30 Minutes or Less. So far the box office has not reflected the increasingly lower standards and lukewarm to poor reviews garnered by these films. But if the 3D phenomenon is any guide where expectations have repeatedly be dashed to continually subject even a pretty undemanding public to lame witless comedies sprinkled with four-letter words and mildly suggestive sexuality may turn R into a red flag for rubbish. Among other sad aspects to this particular movie is the depressing sight of otherwise good actors trapped in such sheer badness and the small wonder that this would be the next project Jesse Eisenberg would choose following his well-deserved best actor Oscar nomination for The Social Network. Perhaps he did this as a favor for his Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer but thats a hard way to pay off a debt. Michael Dilibertis screenplay (based on a story by him and Matthew Sullivan) revolves around the false premise that if one team of bumbling idiots is hilarious as in Dumb and Dumber then you double the fun with two teams. Not only does the math not work it actually works to increase the tedium since you get no relief by switching from one lethally stupid pair to another. Its just more of the same. STORY 30 Minutes or Less 5 Things Seen and Heard on the Red Carpet Pair No. 1 is Eisenbergs pizza delivery boy Nick -- he must deliver in 30 minutes or less --  who is no boy but rather a slacker so typical to such comedies and Aziz Ansaris Chet a reformed slacker now grade school teacher who is nonetheless hapless. The other guys are criminal conspirators -- or would like to think they are instead of the lowlife do-nothings and think-even-less they in fact are Danny McBrides Dwayne and Nick Swardsons Travis. The plot sounds like something dreamed up while smoking dope Dwayne and Travis who would have to get exceedingly ambitious to be called slackers mean to get their hands on the lottery winnings of Dwaynes ex-military dad (Fred Ward) in order to open a brothel masquerading as a tanning salon. So they want to hire a hit man only they have no money so they decide to rob a bank for the money but would rather someone else do the job so they kidnap Nick and strap a time bomb to his body so that hell do. Are you laughing uncontrollably yet? Nick naturally enlists Chet to help him. They try to figure out a way out of Nicks predicament but cant so they decide theyd better rob a bank. They buy a lot of convenience store paraphernalia and then decide theyd better steal a get-away car which they dont know how to do but the script insists they bumble successfully through every crime including the pathetic bank robbery. Things get more complicated -- but no funnier -- when the hit man (Michael Pena) his stripper lover (Bianc Kajlich) Chets sister (Dilshad Vadsaria) and Dwaynes dad all take turns in gumming up the works. The ending is surprisingly dark given that nothing in the Three Stooges tone Fleischer has established prepares you for this. Its a minor flaw though in a film whose major flaw is extreme dullness. When a script is this bare-bones bad actors overcompensate by increasing their antics with each scene and trying too hard to find laughs where none exists. Eisenberg does barely maintain his dignity while Ansari gets more wide-eyed and frantic by the minute. Meanwhile McBride and Swardson hit the same notes tirelessly. Pena Kajlich and Ward all suggest characters that might be interesting in a well-written dark comedy but here go to waste. Fleischer stages one chase scene with a bit of comic flair but otherwise never locates that mix of macabre action and comedy that at least made Zombieland amusing. The film takes place in Grand Rapids Michigan which is made to look as grim and depressing as the movie itself.
