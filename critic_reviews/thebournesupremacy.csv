Now living in anonymity in a beach hut in Goa with his German girlfriend (Franka Potente) hes dragged back into the spy game when a hit man (Karl Urban) working for a Russian oil tycoon tracks him to India having framed him for two CIA-related murders in Berlin. Plagued by bad dreams and a troubled memory Bourne hotfoots it to Berlin via Naples and Munich (the transcontinental plot flits around Europe like a dervish) convinced his old bosses are out to get him vowing to take them down. Pity then those trying to stop him Joan Allens incoming CIA chief and Brian Coxs returning agency operative.In his Hollywood debut Bloody Sunday director and acclaimed documentarian Greengrass proves himself equally adept at action building on the edginess of Doug Limans original with a feverish handheld camera and frenetic editing which lend the film - even more loosely based on Robert Ludlums source material than before - an urgency and a ferocious realism in keeping with the books (if not the films) cold war-setting and the solemnity of Damons ever resourceful Bourne. More Batman than Bond he can improvise with a rolled up magazine in hand-to-hand combat and has unparalleled linguistic and fighting skills. Thankfully hes the good guy a singular killing machine we can feel for. Like Bourne himself this is clinically ruthless in approach a relentlessly paced non-stop chase movie that culminates in a breathless foot and car pursuit across a frozen Moscow. The ending sets up a third. On the strength of this it would be most welcome.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

First Matt Damon goes here and then for some reason he goes there. Then having arrived there he picks a new destination and heads over to that place. Now and then a fight or a car chase breaks out now and then he bumps into a particular Russian assassin but mostly he just experiences the glories of modern transportation. Then in the end he confesses his sins to Anna Kournikova and all is well in the world. What? Youre telling me that wasnt Anna Kournikova? All right all right but she (Oksana Akinshina) sure looks like Kournikova and she acts about as well as Anna did in her American Express commercial of a few years back. Whatever. A sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"" derived more or less -- well actually not more but quite a bit less -- from a Robert Ludlum novel of the 70s the movie follows the amnesiac Jason Bourne (snoozy Damon) who in his unremembered life was an international CIA hit man (question Why are amnesiacs always international hit men and never say service department managers at the Sears store in Dubuque?). ""Supremacy"" takes off with the forgetful Mr. Bourne and his gal pal (Franka Potente) hanging out in Goa India while he tries to remember who he was. Franka Potente fan club members be warned This is unlikely to be her breakthrough movie. Ill tell you no more . . . but bring hankies. Meanwhile -- the movie is full of meanwhiles -- in Berlin a CIA operation has gone bad two case officers are killed and although we know Jason was in Goa drowning his sorrows in curry and those double-size bottles of Taj Mahal and trying to forget Ben Affleck weve seen that pesky Russian hit guy put a phony fingerprint on a dummy detonator thus convincing CIA biggie Joan Allen that Bournes the bad guy whom she must hunt down and kill. Your question would be What is Joan Allen doing in a movie like this? And the answer is she got tired of playing Nixons wife so in this one she gets to play Nixon. Shes all bark bark bark and she metalicizes her eyes like ball bearings and spits her dialogue out in small pungent gobs like well spit. Shes the WASP good girl (4.0 accum cheerleader captain advanced placement classes) grown up and gone Agency Old Girl. Clothes by Talbots hair by Breck disposition by Martha Stewart. But possibly its not fair to single her out for dialogue-spitting Everyone in the film spits out their dialogue. Thats one of the stylizations of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" along with dit-dit-dotted datelines such as ""Berlin Germany"" and ""Goa India"" (but never ""Chugwater Wyoming""). I had some trouble with the plot but Im not the only one -- so did the screenwriter. I think its something like this A traitor still in the agency realizes that certain docs that reveal him are about to be picked up by the Berlin office so he blabs about the operation to his evil cohorts who in turn -- that bad-penny Russian assassin is involved -- set up the frame. But Bourne survives an early assassination attempt and starts off on his own worldwide travel itinerary to get to the bottom of all this. He seems to represent not moral rectitude or even crass revenge but Travelocity. Damon is dull in a part that wont let him be anything but. Allen is lively particularly in her spat-fests with the great Brian Cox as an opposing CIA exec; the two have wonderful anti-chemistry and Id love to see them in a remake of ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" or ""The Bickersons."" The pesky Russky is played with ominous cheekbones by Karl Urban and does this guy have a career going or what? In his last five roles hes played Kirill Vaako Eomer (twice) Munder and best of all Capt. Aran Dravyk. The movie is utterly synthetic. By that I mean its suspense -- yes its suspenseful -- is not organic. It doesnt come from the classical model of motive propelling character propelling plot which further compels dangerous imagination-provoking circumstances. Instead its imposed from the outside arbitrarily. The musical score by John Powell is one such example. If you ever wondered what happened to the Little Drummer Boy the answer is he grew up and became John Powell. Boomlay boomlay boomlay boom That much pounding of the skins on a soundtrack could make drying paint exciting Then theres the camera style. Greengrass is most famous for his very fine 2002 film ""Bloody Sunday"" a re-creation of the Derry massacre of 1972 in Northern Ireland where British troops opened fire on a civil rights demonstration. He deployed a cinema verite technique to great effect in that film using choppy hand-held camera work to convey the chaos fury fear and violence of a civic tragedy. You were there. Obviously the owners of the Bourne franchise were paying attention and gobbled him up to bring the same energy to this edition. But its far less effective because its overused to the point of inducing nausea in some (Im betting three upchucks per showing on opening weekend) and sleep in others. Gunfights fistfights car chases they all look the same -- blurred choppy edited as if to the rhythm of popping corn initially exciting but once you get it increasingly annoying. And finally theres the anachronistic banality of the entire conceit. Everything in the movie feels old from the ancient trope of the ""super agent"" which dates from the 60s to the amnesia gimmick (even older) to the flashing datelines and the steely japing of the agency executives to the utter predictability of the ultimate villain. Sometimes something old can seem new again. But in the case of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" something old just seems old. The Bourne Supremacy (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 but is an excellent example of ratings creep as its violence is frequent and graphic.

"The Bourne Supremacy spy vs. spy. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Bourne Supremacy spy vs. spy. The Bourne Supremacy spy vs. spy. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 23 2004 230 PM Bourne to Run A faster niftier sequel The Bourne Supremacy. By David Edelstein Where did I leave my car keys? If theres any doubt about the effect of cutting-edge video and documentary techniques on ho-hum movie material theres a virtuoso demonstration in The Bourne Supremacy (Universal) the superior sequel to the 2002 hit The Bourne Identity. The first film was fast adroit and something more. Viewed six months after 9/11 the adaptation of a 1980 Robert Ludlum potboiler was weirdly comforting Its universe of pasty old white guys playing Cold War chess with sundry operatives in Eastern Europe stirred feelings of tender nostalgia (at least for us non-Eastern Europeans). The sequel is simply a tour-de-force of thriller filmmaking. The English director Paul Greengrass made the amazing 2002 movie Bloody Sunday--I almost wrote ""the amazing documentary"" because that film (about the infamous Irish civil rights march of 1972 that ended in a massacre) was shot like a piece of combat photography. You werent watching a re-creation you were right there in the middle of the melee helpless and sickened. Greengrass brings the same verite charge to this old-fashioned patently fictional spy picture. He puts you on the street with the amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne (again Matt Damon) scanning a crowd that streaks by so fast that your eyes dont quite focus You only half-catch the guy with the rifle taking aim before the bullet explodes and the world is up-ended. The film has hand-to-hand battles so close and blurry and tumultuous that they summon up your primitive fight-or-flight instincts. Its as if the filmmaker (and the camera operator) are thinking on their feet alongside the hero moving instinctively to keep up with their subjects for fear that said subjects will fly out of the frame. And the audience is just as wired-in I could barely look down at my popcorn. Advertisement Better yet I didnt have time to mull over the absurdities of the plot. When The Bourne Supremacy opens Jason is living furtively in India still with Marie (Franka Potente) the only constant in his addled life. The first Bourne film began with its protagonist floating off the coast of Marseilles with two bullets in his back and the number of a Zurich safe-deposit box in some sort of laser body-implant. He had no idea who he was but he had somehow retained his lightning martial-arts reflexes his fluency in a handful of languages and the instincts of a superspy assassin. Two years and many corpses later hes further along the memory road but there are pieces missing--especially of a mission (he thinks in Berlin) that left two people dead. Why does it gnaw at him so? Perhaps for the same reason that someone has framed him for the murder of a couple of spies involved in a top-secret dossier transaction and is now trying to blow him away for good. The script again by Tony Gilroy is full of pungent spyspeak and clever spy-versus-spy one-upmanship but its largely an excuse to keep Bourne (and the camera) in whirling motion. After he takes his anguished leave of Marie Bourne speeds through the Alps toward Berlin where CIA agent Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) leads a team in pursuit of the killer of her operatives. Who is on whose tail? Landys after Bourne but its Bourne who has Landy and her agents under surveillance. Nobody knows whats really going on but somehow everybody (Bourne Landy CIA bigwigs whole police forces motley assassins) converges at regular intervals for bravura cliffhangers. ""How does he do that?"" we think as Bourne disarms an agent with moves so fast you barely register them leaps off a fire escape darts in and out of cars hurtles over a railing onto a barge then scampers up the side of a bridge and behind the 20 police cars that are chasing him. What we dont think is ""He can do that because hes a digitized little guy inside a computer simulation."" How refreshing to see action thats the real deal The Bourne Supremacy improves on its predecessor by telling two stories. Its not just Bourne running away from police and assassins and people in headquarters screaming ""Get Bourne""--although there is a lot of that come to think of it. Its also Joan Allens Landry trying to ferret out the reason that so many of her higher-ups (especially Brian Cox returning as shifty CIA honcho Ward Abbott) want to kill Bourne before he can stagger in from the cold. Is she a good guy or a bad guy? Poor Bourne doesnt know what to make of it all but Damon manages to play befuddlement without the slightest loss of virility. Impassive as he is you can always see the wheels turning in his head; he turns the gap between his plodding demeanor and those automatic quicksilver reflexes into something witty and moving. Even existential Bourne doesnt have much of a self but he acts. The Bourne Supremacy doesnt have much of a self either but that marvelous action is identity enough. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Credit Jasin Boland 2004 Universal Studios. All Rights Reserved. Bourne23 MATT DAMON as Jason Bourne in the espionage thriller The Bourne Supremacy. Credit Jasin Boland 2004 Universal Studios. All Rights Reserved. On the run again keeping a level head -- and perfect hair 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Bourne Supremacy Suspense thriller. Starring Matt Damon Joan Allen Brian Cox and Franka Potente. Directed by Paul Greengrass. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Almost everything that made ""The Bourne Identity"" refreshing -- the wit the irony the suspense the novelty of its premise -- is gone in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and whats left is the spectacle of Matt Damon with perfect posture and senses primed like a cat making his way through a routine action thriller. That isnt bad but it is disappointing for anyone who remembers what made the first movie so enjoyable. If director Doug Liman brought a new sensibility to ""The Bourne Identity "" giving the action a faintly absurdist edge Paul Greengrass who directed the sequel brings an old-time sensibility a straight-ahead dead seriousness. He couples this approach with two chronic mistakes in strategy He consistently forgets to clue the audience in on basic information such as who is shooting at whom and why. And he films every action scene as though doing a behind-the-camera interpretive dance based on Don Knotts classic performance in ""The Shakiest Gun in the West."" That ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is still fairly entertaining (as in definitely watchable) is a testament to the durability of formula An innocent man is unfairly targeted for assassination by nefarious secret agents foreign and domestic. More interestingly its a testament to Damon and what his physical presence somehow just conveys. To see him hurrying through a market in India or even running from security in Berlin is to see a big corn-fed American kid now grown up and in serious trouble. Its to see someone whom no one in the audience has to be talked into rooting for. Its instinctive. Related Stories On the run -- again -- in The Bourne Supremacy Two years have passed since we last saw Jason Bourne. At the start of the film he is living in a corner of India with his German girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente). Despite the remote location his hair looks perfect. Maybe Marie gives him daily trims. But hair is the least of his worries. He still cant remember his past. He still has nightmares. He wakes up in a sweat burning up with fever -- and this is before anything bad happens. And then bad happens way bad and all at once. One morning in a village market he sees a car takes one look at the driver and his trained killers instinct tells him that something isnt right. A chase ensues and in the aftermath Jason knows he isnt safe. There are people after him and he has to find them before they find him. The main person looking for him is Joan Allen as a CIA boss named Pamela who thinks that Bourne killed two of her agents when in fact Bourne was miles away at the time probably getting a haircut. She reassembles the team that worked earlier on the Bourne case including Abbott a CIA veteran with dark secrets who just wants Bourne dead. Abbott is played by Brian Cox who has picked up the baton dropped by the late J.T. Walsh as Hollywoods exemplar of the powerful untrustworthy man. The title ""The Bourne Supremacy"" promises something it doesnt deliver something further suggested by the advertising tagline ""They should have left him alone."" The title suggests a reversal of the first movie with Bourne in possession of himself and the facts mounting an offensive against the people whove victimized him. But the movie is really a muddle. Bourne is improvising getting shot at here strangling somebody there. He has no system. Anyway theres really no villain unless you count some nameless Russian assassin or poor Abbott who is too much of a nervous wreck to inspire an audiences bloodlust. And though Pamela is ostensibly working against Bourne Allens undisguisable probity makes it impossible to mistake her for a bad guy. This moral messiness this whole spectacle of confusion could have been made into a virtue had the director approached the story with some ironic distance. But the only distance Greengrass creates is that which comes of bad technique wobbly images blurred fragments. And were in no position to appreciate the irony of the situation if we have no idea whats going on. -- Advisory This film contains violence and some strong language.

The Bourne Supremacy Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-bourne-supremacy-2004,200,thebournesupremacy7,thebournesupremacy,rogerebert
"Review Bourne a thrill-a-minute powerhouse - CNN.com Review Bourne a thrill-a-minute powerhouseStory Highlights ""Bourne Ultimatum"" has terrific action-packed set pieces Film directed by Paul Greengrass also has ideas under its frantic pace Matt Damon David Strathairn Joan Allen lead solid cast Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Its not easy being Bourne again. It means a lot of miles a lot of challenges and all for uncertain ends. And you never know what youll have to explain ""My fight is not with you"" Matt Damons amnesiac rogue CIA agent evading capture in Moscow says to a local cop in Russian before beating a nonviolent retreat. Matt Damons Jason Bourne remains on the run in ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" Thus begins ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" the series third and final installment. Despite a marked limp in this early running Bourne remains on the run globe-hopping to Paris London Madrid Tangiers and finally home to New York. Hes also getting closer to connecting the dots and discovering his true identity. But its not just the ""who"" that drives him its also the ""why"" why was he brainwashed into an implacable impervious -- and it seems just about impregnable -- killing machine? The Bourne series gets a lot of credit for a supposedly more hard-nosed contemporary take on espionage than other spy movies we could mention. This is largely a function of style. Bourne travels light and adopts a pragmatic hands-on approach to problem solving. He has no truck with the CGI thats got the better of ""Die Hard"" cop John McClane. But when the bullets fly hes as Teflon as the next superagent. One minute hes floored by a bomb blast the next hes sprinting across rooftops like hes trying out for a triathlon. Hes one-man surge. Watch an audio slide show with Bourne soundtrack composer John Powell This being a Paul Greengrass movie -- he directed ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""United 93"" -- the shock absorbers are off the framing is epileptic and its a rare shot that lasts more than a millisecond. The effect is purposely disorienting but even in the midst of this breathless visual bombardment Greengrass his cinematographer Oliver Wood and editor Christopher Rouse have a knack for homing in on the vital dynamic element in the frame even if were only able to process the information a beat or two later when that blurry gun or book or voice recorder comes in to play. Dont Miss Composer John Powell  Helping Bourne rise to the occasion Indeed the action pounds so thick and fast its a relief when hard-working composer John Powell grants us a brief reprieve for a brutal hand-to-hand scrap scored only to thumps bumps and grunts. Still much to Greengrass and Co.s credit they want to get to the ""why"" too. It takes awhile thats not a question CIA headquarters is ready to address and certainly not in public. CIA deputy director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) is aghast when the agency picks up a British journalists reference to the top-secret codename ""Blackbriar"" in a cell phone conversation with his editor. (Forget the Patriot Act; these guys are eavesdropping across the Atlantic now.) In the first of the films dizzyingly orchestrated cat-and-mouse sequences Bourne steals the reporter out from under a thousand virtual Agency eyes and ears in Londons Waterloo Station. (Tip for the terrorists to avoid detection when all else fails tie your shoelaces.) The hack doesnt make it but Bourne is nothing if not elusive and its on to the next stage in his whirlwind European tour. Along the way he has a suspiciously serendipitous encounter with old acquaintance Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) before executing another adept variation on an escapist theme. Bourne -- or whatever his name really is -- is such a resourceful and reckless agent of chaos we thrill to him despite the fact that hes officially a non-entity. Matt Damon makes enough of his scarce terse exchanges with Nicky and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to suggest remorse spurs him more than revenge. Landy in particular comes to figure as a mother-confessor. Shes the only one who understands Bournes true nature blowback. Which turns ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" into a thinking-mans action film. Reflecting a growing apprehension that counterintelligence agencies have overstepped legal and ethical boundaries ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" smartly affects kick-ass with a conscience by implying weve become our own worst enemy. Who knew guilt could be such a trip? ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" runs 111 minutes and is rated PG-13. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

"Bourne to run - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Bourne to run Matt Damon returns as an amnesiac ex-CIA killer in the breathtakingly breakneck Bourne Supremacy By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  July 23 2004 The British filmmaker Paul Greengrass likes to stick you right in the middle of it. If you saw 2002s ""Bloody Sunday"" his brilliantly scarifying cinematic re-creation of the 1972 Londonderry massacre you know what the man can do with a hand-held camera a skilled editor and a handful of characters each with his or her own agenda and idiosyncrasies.With ""The Bourne Supremacy"" Greengrass has gone Hollywood. Or rather Hollywood has come to him. Actually its a bit of a standoff. The film starringMatt Damon as the amnesiac ex-CIA killer Jason Bourne is a terse tight impressively smart package much like its predecessor Doug Limans 2002 ""The Bourne Identity."" Both movies try to reinvent that logy old white elephant the Cold War spy thriller for a new century of global anxiety and both succeed by ripping up the playbook -- which includes almost all of novelist Robert Ludlums original story line -- and plunging the viewer into a mares-nest of international intrigue. The difference is that Greengrasss knack for total immersion leaves a viewer hanging on throughout ""Supremacy"" fighting disorientation and enjoyablycharged up by the chase-scene huggermugger. For once those datelines in the corner of the screen -- ""Berlin Germany"" ""Goa India"" ""Naples Italy"" ticka-ticka-ticka -- come in handy since theyre among the few handholds the movie provides. (I also recommend renting the first film to those who havent seen it.) The hero of ""Supremacy"" is in a similar fix People want him dead and he has no idea why. It might help if Bourne knew who he was but the memory loss with which he struggled in ""Identity"" continues to plague him. He realizes he was a not-so-nice boy for a black-ops wing of the CIA called the Treadstone Project and the shards of a recurrent dream send him jogging down the beach in India where hes hiding out with girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) in the opening scenes. Turns out hell need the exercise since someone is assassinating agents and leaving Bournes fingerprints as evidence.There are a number of parties working at cross-purposes here a slimy Russian oil entrepeneur (Karel Roden); his personal assassin (Karl Urban of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" sporting his third radically different haircut in as many movies); a highly placed CIA agent named Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) whos convinced that Bourne is a rogue killing machine; Brian Cox as a phlegmatic CIA hatchet man with multiple axes to grind; Julia Stiles still underutilized as a low-level agency cog.The connective tissue -- the man they all want to get their hands on -- is played by Damon without an ounce of movie-star fat. The comparisons getting old but its still worth raising Where Ben Affleck might showboat his way through this kind of role his old homeboy underplays to greater effect furrowing his brow boring straight ahead and trying to cut a straight swath through all the manipulations. Damon doesnt ask to be watched and thats why we watch him and the payoff is a quiet powerhouse of a scene in which in front of one of the movies very few innocents Bourne finally lets his emotions get the better of him.This is after a 10th-inning demolition-derby car chase through rush-hour Moscow one of several sequences in which Greengrass uses his you-are-there skills to build a faster gnarlier action movie. These scenes -- theres a corker through the streets of Berlin and a fight in which Bourne armed only with a rolled-up magazine goes up against a knife-wielding assailant -- are breathtaking but exhausting and by the end youre ready to cry uncle.Still the way Greengrass lets you feel the violence is impressive. Most movie heroes punch through armies without scraping their knuckles but Bournes a believable wreck by midpoint even as hes driving CIA spooks to distraction by calling them on their cellphones from nearby rooftops.Its the past that weighs most heavily on him though. Tony Gilroys script is serviceably pungent (""Youre standing in a puddle of [expletive] and you dont have the shoes for it"" one character warns Landy) but it has a ball with the dour pop premise driving this series. Most of us have trouble dealing with the mistakes we know weve made. Jason Bourne wants to atone for sins he cant even remember.

(All due credit goes to Robert Ludlum of course whose books are the headwaters of this plentiful richness.) Although director Paul Greengrasss hyper-frenetic camera movement and almost-stroboscopic editing could induce a brain seizure at times ""Supremacy"" feels sleek elegant and stripped down. And its straight-ahead plotting low-tech action sequences and narrative efficiency make effortless mockery of the James Bond franchise which -- though financially successful -- has long become a garish parody of itself overloaded with product placement gadgetry stale formula and brain-pounding music. For the characters in ""Supremacy"" there is little time for anything but the immediate business of killing the other guy before he gets you. Matt Damon reprising his role as Jason Bourne is outwardly chilly and ruthless but passionately engaged. He has one simple mission. It needs no memorandums no briefings no contact with spy handlers. He has to stay alive. Everyone it seems is trying to kill him. Despite changed names and exile in a hidden sleepy corner of India the former CIA assassin and his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) find themselves being chased by an unknown assailant (Karl Urban). The would-be killer is very good at what he does. But Bourne whose loss of memory was outlined in 2002s ""The Bourne Identity"" is trained to do one better. What is Bournes past? Whos behind the latest round of his troubles? Why are they picking on Bourne? What is the mission called Treadstone? What is Bournes importance to Langley? These are the questions that give this movie its delicious urgency. Bournes still mentally scrambling to discover his real identity and what terrible things he might have been involved in as a trained killer. The latest surge of aggression directed against him he eventually learns comes from a double hit in Berlin. Two CIA operatives performing a mission to receive classified materials have been executed. A fingerprint Bournes has been discovered at the scene of the crime. Even though Bourne was thousands of miles away at the time he has to face the concerted might of the CIA led by a very motivated Pamela Landy (Joan Allen). Its time for Bourne to fight back. A movie like this is no good without formidable enemies. And even though weve seen these archetypes a thousand times before theres something refreshingly ominous about CIA mission leaders Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and Landy whose institutional muscle technology and will to close this case for good are daunting even for a master improviser like Bourne. Greengrass (who made the memorable Irish political drama ""Bloody Sunday"") and scriptwriter Tony Gilroy (who adapted the previous ""Bourne"") have almost completely removed human warmth from the movie. (The exceptions are Bournes early moments with Marie and a finale with someone who figures largely in his traumatic past.) But that coldness is the movies greatest asset. Everyones a candidate to be toe-tagged if they dont pay attention. Its simply a treat to watch Bourne outwit his enemies and stay one step ahead of death. That human business between caring individuals? Save it for an Italian movie. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (PG-13 110 minutes) -- Contains violence and obscenity. Area theaters.

Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) reunites with his German traveling companion Marie (Franka Potente) in The Bourne Supremacy. Universal Pictures The Bourne Supremacy the sequel to 2002s The Bourne Identity is taut tightly paced and thrilling with some of the best chase sequences -- whether by foot taxi or Jeep -- in recent memory. (Related videoSee a clip from Bourne Supremacy) But this gripping film is not just about edge-of-the-seat action. The cast is even more impressive than in the first film Joan Allen is the new standout as a driven but compassionate CIA official bent on tracking down hired assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon brilliant again). Returning are Julia Stiles in an assured turn; and Brian Cox in a nuanced performance. But the movie belongs to Damon whose Bourne is manly exquisitely tough and oddly endearing given hes a cold-blooded killer. Damon masters a major undertaking He comes off sympathetically in moments of conscience and conflicted emotion while also being entirely credible as the best and brightest of the CIAs trained killers. ABOUT THE MOVIE The Bourne Supremacy    1/2 (out of four) Stars Matt Damon Joan Allen Franka Potente Brian Cox Julia Stiles Director Paul Greengrass Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for violence and intense action and brief language Opens Friday nationwide As an outside-the-box action hero he is haunted by fragmented memories from his past. This installment begins with Bourne living contentedly -- if still confused about his identity -- in India with Marie (Franka Potente reprising her role as his free-spirited German lover). But their idyllic lives are shattered when he is framed for two murders in Berlin. Tracking his pursuers takes him to Italy Germany the Netherlands and Russia. The lightning-fast reflexes and sharply tuned senses we saw in the first film are in top form We believe that even wounded and bleeding he can commandeer a speeding taxi eluding bad guys through the crowded streets of Moscow. Bourne is also a man in love making his enigmatic character more relatable. He could be the monogamous more serious younger brother of James Bond far less concerned with living the good life than 007 but often just as witty and shrewd. While in Moscow he speaks what passes for perfectly accented Russian. In Berlin he speaks German like a native. Bournes complex personality has even more fascinating aspects. He grapples with guilt and grief as he pieces together the crimes he has committed and their repercussions. British director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday) was an inspired choice for the sequel. As fine a job as Doug Liman did on BourneIdentity Greengrass gives Bourne Supremacy a dynamism and edgy quality closer in spirit to a gritty European thriller than a summer action blockbuster.

Directed by Paul Greengrass from a screenplay by Tony Gilroy based on the novel by Robert Ludlum. 108 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action and brief language. Several theaters. If you can possibly avoid it try not to be trapped in a room with any of the characters from the new action thriller ""The Bourne Supremacy."" These people are all very good at what Ill call Sudden Improbable Overpowering -- take your eyes off them at your peril. Matt Damon in particular has clearly been drinking his superhero juice; this guy could probably take out an entire multiplex full of people most of whom would be too busy saying ""Hey howd that Good Will Hunting guy get those muscles?"" to resist. ""Supremacy"" makes for an enjoyable-enough night at the movies though its not as well-crafted as its predecessor Doug Limans 2002 hit ""The Bourne Identity."" That film the story of a trained assassin trying to remember his shadowy past while simultaneously coping with a lot of people who wanted to kill him (based on Robert Ludlums novel) featured a number of surprising pleasures Damons oddly low-key likable turn as a buff action star; the offbeat casting of Franka Potente (""Run Lola Run"") as his girlfriend; the glamorously lit European locations; the breathtaking car chases; and one of modern cinemas better off-the-cuff haircutting scenes. (Yes go back and rent the DVD if you missed it.) But Liman passed on the directors chair this time around handing the franchise over to Paul Greengrass -- who apparently never met a quick cut he didnt like. ""Supremacy"" is caffeine cinema; its every scene pieced together with a multitude of staccato moments. Greengrass ""Bloody Sunday"" used a similarly jittery style to better effect -- in that documentarylike drama about the Irish civil-rights struggle all the movement contributed to a messy breathless real-life feel appropriate to the story Greengrass was telling. Here it gets in the way of the elegance of the performances and interferes with our enjoyment of the action sequences -- we always feel as if were trying to catch up. You can sense the joyride effect that Greengrass was going for but its just overkill. Late in the film theres a long slow shot of a large apartment building with its windows glowing in the late-day light like jewels and its like a nap for the eyes -- this movie needed to slow down a bit to get a little lost in the story its been so busy drowning out. But an excess of style is a forgivable sin and Greengrass film offers enough enjoyment to offset its own franticness. Much of the fine original cast (alas no Clive Owen or Chris Cooper) has returned with a few key additions -- most notably Joan Allen as a fetchingly tough CIA agent. The story -- which reportedly has little to do with Ludlums book -- unfolds in intriguing fits and starts never over-explaining. (In fact a few key plot points from the first movie are finally clarified here.) And so its best simply to say that Damons Bourne is still struggling with his memories that hes on the run across Europe with a passel of agents and adversaries scurrying in his wake that everyone wears dark clothes and looks cooler than an iced latte (you wonder how these spies stay undercover as they look so much better than everyone else) and that the door remains open for another movie preferably one in which Damon and Allen will share more screen time. As summer blockbusters go ""The Bourne Supremacy"" isnt ""Spider-Man 2"" but its better than most weve seen so far this season. Keep a close eye on Damon though -- his slippery Bourne keeps turning up where you least expect him. Wasnt that him in the popcorn line?

"Bourne Supremacy The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bourne-supremacy-the ) Bourne Supremacy The (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Bourne Supremacy is a serviceable thriller - no more no less. This may come as a disappointment to those anticipating something on the same level as the surprise hit 2002 movie The Bourne Identity. Sadly the cinematic second installment of Robert Ludlums trilogy falls short of its predecessor in almost every area except perhaps acting. Theres nothing wrong with any of the performances in this movie; its just that the actors arent as important as they were two years ago. Action has moved to the fore shouldering aside plot and character development in order to maintain the frantic pace that director Paul Greengrass believes is necessary to retain his audiences attention. The Bourne Supremacy opens two years after The Bourne Identity closed with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) having settled down with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente of Run Lola Run fame). Now it appears someone with the worst of intentions has found them. Not only is a killer (Karl Urban) dispatched remove Bourne but he is framed for the murder of a CIA agent in Berlin. This brings the agency back into the picture. The ""find Bourne"" team is led by Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Bournes old boss Ward Abbott (Brian Cox). Thinking that the CIA is behind the attempt on his life Bourne decides that the most appropriate response is to track down a few old acquaintances and remove them forever from the picture thus fulfilling the promise he made near the end of The Bourne Identity. At its heart The Bourne Supremacy is a revenge picture. Theres nothing more subtle or deeper going on here although there is a secondary plot about a group of Russians. Character development is perfunctory. We learn a few more things about Bournes past and he shows signs of a conscience. However he was more interesting in the last film when he was foundering to discover who he was. This time around Bourne is just a relentless killer at least until the final 30 minutes when he displays more compassion than we expect (or in some ways prefer). After the initial 15 minutes of exposition The Bourne Supremacy unfolds as a series of long chase and fight sequences. Some of these are more compelling than others. The final chase in particular is involving. Coming as late in the movie as it does theres a sense that it will lead to a resolution (rather than the usual ""oops I lost him""). There are plenty of instances of hand-to-hand combat and thats where the choice of Greengrass (Bloody Sunday) becomes questionable. The director of The Bourne Identity Doug Liman was able to present the fight scenes in a clear no-frills fashion. In The Bourne Supremacy there are so many cuts and edits that the fights devolve into an incoherent mess. Its better not to try to follow them when theyre going on - just wait until theyre over to see whos left standing. On a number of levels The Bourne Supremacy isnt as satisfying as The Bourne Identity. The culmination of Bournes revenge spree against the agency while it accomplishes the task doesnt offer a good sense of closure. And the fact that Bourne spends most of the movie on his own eliminates the nice give-and-take between Bourne and Marie that helped make The Bourne Identity better than a generic espionage flick. Not having read Ludlums novel I cant assess whether the problem is in the source material or in Tony Gilroys adaptation but The Bourne Supremacy is less intelligent than its predecessor. In the title role Damon again proves that he has the makeup to be a decent action hero. Hes more in the mold of a Mel Gibson or a Harrison Ford than an Arnold Schwarzenegger but theres room in the genre for all kinds of actors. Brian Cox is suitably oily as the bad CIA guy whose role has been expanded from the first film. Joan Allen brushes up on her ice queen image to give Bourne a more formidable agency adversary than Abbott. There are also brief appearances from familiar faces Potente and Julia Stiles as well as a small-but-important part for Oksana Akinshina (the star of Lilya 4-Ever) as a Russian girl. Although The Bourne Supremacy disappoints relative to expectations established by The Bourne Identity its neither unwatchable nor uninteresting. The continuity is strong (essentially everyone except the director is the same) and the lead character while not as compelling this time around is still worth rooting for. Plus theres enough action to camouflage the thinness of the plot. Still its discouraging to encounter another sequel that cant live up to the standard established by its predecessor.

After two bruising outings as Robert Ludlums amnesiac CIA assassin it may well be that Bourne will stand as Matt Damons signature role so completely does he own it. Jason Bourne keeps his edge in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" a nonstop chase that serves its dish of post-Cold War spy games very cold but with a pungent trace of melancholy. After two bruising outings as Robert Ludlums amnesiac CIA assassin it may well be that Bourne will stand as Matt Damons signature role so completely does he own it. The action is confusing at first and the hyperventilated editing style at times goes beyond the pale so pic ultimately emerges as an erratic but not unworthy sequel to its gritty genre-invigorating predecessor. ""The Bourne Identity"" exceeded expectations by grossing 213 million theatrically (121.7 domestically 92.2 foreign) worldwide in 2002 and becoming Universals top DVD/video title last year so a substantial fan base exists to produce muscular numbers for this pile-driving follow-up. Trotting the globe even more than the original ""Supremacy"" sees the return not only of several principal actors but of numerous key behind-the-scenes hands including scripter Tony Gilroy cinematographer Oliver Wood and composer John Powell. Major newcomer replacing Doug Liman as director is Paul Greengrass whose 2002 look at a tragic day in Northern Ireland ""Bloody Sunday"" was lensed in arresting docu-drama style. Format remains very much the same with Bourne first seen decompressing on the beach at Goa India with his ""Identity"" companion Marie (Franka Potente) quickly going on the run to elude pursuers intent on putting him permanently out of business. As before he is struggling to piece together clues to recapture lost memory. Right off the bat a tough assassin (Karl Urban) sent by a Russian oil tycoon chases Bourne and Marie through Goas teeming streets with calamitous results that for a while take the wind out of the pictures sails when its barely left port. At the same time the CIA is coping with the loss of two men on a blown job in Berlin. Hard-ass agency task force chief Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) literally sees Bournes fingerprints on the treachery and forcing the soon-to-retire senior operative Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) to help her resolves to reel in the trouble-making rogue agent whose shadowy kill squad was shuttered two years back with the death of its chief (Chris Cooper seen and heard very briefly in flashbacks). His stealthy anticipatory skills and deadly fighting techniques still in peak condition Bourne quietly makes his way to Naples where he fakes out guards and interrogators who momentarily nab him then proceeds to Munich where he engages in ferocious hand-to-hand combat with a former colleague (Marton Csokas making a strong impression in a short time). Shot within the tight confines of an apartment scene packs about as much visceral punch as is possible under PG-13 restraints and yet is shot in a way indicative of Greengrass handling of all the set-pieces; action is conveyed in such a piecemeal rapid-cut manner that even more than was the case with Limans approach its often hard to tell whats going on. One has to imagine that the lack of clarity continuity and coherence in this furiously fought sequence is intentional as its impact verges on the impressionistic. For all its visual bedazzlement however there are equal aspects of breathless bluster insistent showiness and defiant disorientation that make the big action scenes most notably a climactic chase through Moscow cut both ways. For a long while the film operates efficiently but almost mechanically on the surface narrative level. But as can and should happen with good spy stories the deep background and dark mysteries of the characters begin seeping to the fore and Bournes powerfully equivocal nature once again exerts its hold. Based on his actions alone Bourne is a nasty piece of work hardly a protagonist worthy of ones emotional interest; but once hes seen clearly enough for what he is a pawn in a deadly game whose resourcefulness in staying alive is impressive the story becomes more engaging. The efforts of assorted hit men notwithstanding Bournes main adversary this time is Landy a principled relentless woman who knows less than she should about Bourne and Abbott and learns the hard way. Once Bourne arrives in Berlin he outfoxes the vigilant Landy at every turn as when he briefly detains one of her team Nicky (Julia Stiles) a contact at the agencys Paris office in ""Identity."" After concluding unfinished business with Abbott Bourne realizes his real mission awaits in Moscow. The Russian capital has never before been so extensively used in an American production nor probably by such a high-turbo action film of any origin so there is an automatic freshness to the pictures final tumultuous stretch provided by the wintry city itself. Episode is capped by an intimate scene that injects the film with an unexpected shot of emotion and regret followed by a teasing coda that could easily provide the jumping-off point for a third ""Bourne"" installment. Once again Damon scores in the title role by never courting audience sympathy and playing his all-American good looks against the hard-shell brutality of the character. Speaking German and Russian when need be with ease Damon uses his rugged physicality without hanging any movie star bravado or posing on it and easily holds the screen in the many scenes when hes the only actor in sight. As before supporting cast is aces. Allen the main newcomer is constrained at first from seeming like anything more than a single-minded functionary who lives to issue demanding orders. As the film begins to breath a bit so does her character and Allen with nothing tangible to work with manages to subtly suggest the existence of a real woman beneath all the officious professionalism. Cox Potente Stiles and Gabriel Mann continue their flavorsome if in some cases abbreviated performances from the first film and Urban is memorable as the stalking gunman with little to say. Much of the films pleasure stems from its many atmospheric locations some of which -- particularly Berlin and Moscow -- carry extensive Cold War resonance. When has a film ever before been able to document what a real train journey from Berlin to Moscow actually looks like right down to pulling into the Moscow station and looking for a taxi? Woods camerawork will be too jittery for some but reeks of the specific atmospheres of the settings. As before Powells techno-dominated score provides a throbbing propulsive pulse.
