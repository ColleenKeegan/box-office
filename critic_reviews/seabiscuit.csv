Stephen Ives ""Seabiscuit"" a historical review of the exploits of the champion racehorse reveals a great deal about the society cheering for the horse. Solidly made in the Ken Burns style that has characterized most non-fiction work on PBS ""American Experience"" saga is so rich in storytelling vigor and colorful characters it would require a second viewing to determine how helmer Ives and his team managed to pack so much information in less than an hour. Touching on several facets of Americana pic has a well-earned slot as the opener of latest edition of the fast-growing smartly-programmed Full Frame docu fest and should be essential viewing on its premiere April 21 airdate. Moreover in video this slice of American history is a keeper. A clip from the first Hollywood adaptation of Seabiscuits triumph ""The Story of Seabiscuit"" serves to indicate what powerful sway this underdog horse story held with Americans during the depths of the Depression -- still strong a decade later in 1949 when the movie (starring Shirley Temple and Barry Fitzgerald) was released -- and how it continues anticipating the upcoming ""Seabiscuit"" starring Tobey Maguire Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper. The view that the ungainly looking equine and his equally unlikely cadre of human supporters was a symbol of American possibility forms the basis of Laura Hillenbrands book on Seabiscuit which in turn is the foundation for Ives film (as well as the upcoming feature). Over the distance of years the symbolism may seem to be a stretch but the film -- with Scott Glenn narrating with big-shouldered style -- convincingly sells the idea. Even though he was a direct descendant of the great Man O War Seabiscuit in 1936 was a consistent loser and judging by the plentiful newsreel footage that provides pic with much of its visual verve a pretty forlorn awkward creature. Vet trainer Tom Smith reportedly saw ""the face of confidence"" that nobody else did and urged owner Charles Howard to buy him for 8000. Adding immensely to the tale is hard-luck jockey John ""Red"" Pollard whose knowledge of down-and-out horses helped him bond with Seabiscuit. Hillenbrands dominant presence as an on-screen commentator (as well as the vibrant observations of sportswriter Gene Smith and sports broadcaster Jack Whitaker) bring alive the countrys desperate mood its hunger for a proletarian hero the near-fanatical popularity of racetrack betting the metaphoric power of sports and the cultural divide between West Coast (particularly at Santa Anita where Seabiscuit first became a celebrity) and East Coast (where snobby bluebloods preferred the aristocratic War Admiral). What is most striking in this account of Seabiscuits incredible odds-bucking string of victories highlighted by a stunning match race against War Admiral and a final race in 1940 at Santa Anita (both of which are shown nearly intact in fine-looking footage) is how the animals rise and setbacks are almost exactly matched by those of his handlers especially Pollard. The jockeys own personal victory is so ""Hollywood"" in flavor and outcome its amazing the studios waited 10 years to do a bigscreen version.

"Seabiscuit | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Seabiscuit Todd McCarthy 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr July 14 2003 | 0740PM PT Attentive to the particulars of its fabulous story historical detail and 1930s period feel ""Seabiscuit"" is respectable when it should be thrilling honorable when it should be rough and ready. The story of one of the greatest American racehorses should create strong public interest in this rare nonsequel/cartoon/kiddie summer release. An update was made to this review on July 15 2003. Fastidiously attentive to the particulars of its fabulous story historical detail and 1930s period feel ""Seabiscuit"" is respectable when it should be thrilling honorable when it should be rough and ready. The story of one of the greatest American racehorses and the three unusual men who took him to the pinnacle was made famous all over again in Laura Hillenbrands sensationally good 2001 bestseller and the books big following combined with the presence of star Tobey Maguire should create strong public interest in this rare nonsequel/cartoon/kiddie summer release from a major studio. Unlike the previous cinematic account of the horses career the 1949 ""The Story of Seabiscuit"" which was so lamentably ahistorical that the thoroughbreds main jockey Red Pollard (Maguires character) didnt even figure in it writer-director Gary Ross treatment hews as scrupulously to the record as may have been possible in a mainstream feature of reasonable length. Such accuracy is not only commendable but perhaps in this case even mandatory in that Hillenbrand put the facts of this astonishing tale so freshly in the publics mind that viewers might not have tolerated much deviation. But this fidelity also has its price which in this case takes the form of a choppy and slow-to-involve first act that provides the backstory of the three men who made possible Seabiscuits makeover from an ungainly also-ran into a horse who in 1938 generated more column inches of copy in the American press than either FDR or Adolf Hitler. Title character doesnt make his grand entrance until 45 minutes in. Ambitiously Ross tries to accomplish everything the book did Tell the story of an amazing racehorse draw three indelible character portraits and create a vivid picture of a very difficult decade -- each of which was hobbled at the beginning and resurrected more or less by the end. And while there is much to enjoy and appreciate in the film Ross winds up looking at the Seabiscuit phenomenon through the wrong end of the telescope. Observing the tale from the long view of history and saddling it with ennobling narration about the Depression from historian David McCullough and a far too inspirational/sentimental score by Randy Newman gives the picture a somewhat embalmed quality that drains a gripping yarn of immediacy and excitement. Formatted much like the book but necessarily sketching rather than detailing the immaculate-looking picture intercuts telling moments in the lives of the three men whose lives would intersect so decisively Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) a San Francisco bicycle repairman-turned-automobile magnate whose life was shattered by the accidental death of his young son and who would eventually buy Seabiscuit; Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) a taciturn wrangler and ""horse whisperer"" whose solitary ways made him an unlikely candidate for the limelight as the horses trainer; and Pollard (an excellent Michael Angarano as a youngster Maguire later on) a game classics-spouting farm boy who at 16 was abandoned by his parents and for years thereafter knocked around the lower realms of the equestrian world. The film devotes an unusual amount of time to character-building over narrative progress even as it slights the books fascinating insights into jockeys hardscrabble lives. Dramatic kick-start also is postponed by frequent cutaways to Depression-era photos over which McCullough intones significant facts and figures in all-too-perfect PBS style. When Smith speaking of a horse another trainer wants to put down says ""You dont throw a whole life away just because hes banged up a little"" the metaphoric stress is such that its clear hes also referring to himself Charles Howard Red Pollard the country and a certain steed he hasnt yet encountered. Mishandled and unappreciated in his early racing life Seabiscuit was all but washed up when he caught the eye of Smith and Howard. Undersized with knobby legs and an ungraceful gait the horse looked like a commoner among racings royalty which ultimately became the source of his mass appeal. He was the little man the long shot the underdog. During the Depression this quality possessed a special charge and Ross explicitly links the horses first victory under the trios tutelage to the idea of personal and national rehabilitation. During the course of a series of smashing victories the West Coast-based Seabiscuit gathers an enormous reputation to the point that Howard is able to pressure upper-crust East Coaster Samuel Riddle (Eddie Jones) into agreeing to a match race against the latters brilliant War Admiral the 1937 Triple Crown winner. The build-up to and account of this extraordinary Nov. 1 1938 event was the heart-quickening sweat-inducing highlight of Hillenbrands book. It also was marked by irony and tragedy as Red Pollard suffered a crushing injury on another horse two weeks before the race and was replaced on Seabiscuit by his closest friend the flashy George Woolf (jockey Gary Stevens in a confident first acting gig). Films of the actual match reveal not only a thrilling race but an exquisite start in which the horses dispensed with a normal starting gate in favor of a walk-up to their date with destiny. Its in his handling of this key moment that Ross tips his hand regarding his priorities. Instead of showing what anyone wants and has a right to expect to see at this point -- the race in its entirety of less than two minutes -- the director cuts away to show ordinary people listening to the radio account so as to emphasize the national interest in the showdown. Ross wants to convey the big picture rather than the human and equine struggle and while he eventually does cut back to the race the moment has been lost the thrill sucked out by one edit. With this long-view approach the event is shoved onto the horizon of history even as it takes place. Shortly thereafter in his second failed attempt to win the Santa Anita Handicap Seabiscuit is injured and joins Pollard in undertaking the long road back. This last section as both horse and jockey against heavy odds prepare for one last shot at the Southern California tracks hundred-grander has its poignant and affecting moments but by this time it has become clear the film is content to occupy the high ground rather than to generate tension and excitement even during Seabiscuits extraordinary final race. Despite the true-life fairy-tale nature of the story which features twists and turns and ups and downs as good as any screenwriter could ever hope to invent this was certainly a tough adaptation to crack if one aspired to tell the whole story. The impulse to include as much detail as possible was clearly irresistible just as the difficulty of conveying all the necessary information about racing horses and society was considerable. What ended up onscreen is always at least interesting and sometimes more than that but the polite impeccably groomed style works against a sense of urgency. The three principal characters are nicely drawn. Playing yet another early-century automobile man (after ""Tucker"") Bridges cuts a warm genial figure as Howard a showman and seemingly a genuinely honorable man. With a thicket of red hair and considerably slimmed down after ""Spider-Man"" Maguire is a convincing Pollard in the saddle and in quiet scenes such as one in which the hospitalized jockey advises his replacement how to ride Seabiscuit. Character is given no personal life however as the character of his wife whom he met while convalescing has been eliminated. Cooper is entirely credible as a man who has spent his life on the range and feels more comfortable around animals than people. Still one cant help but suspect some bets have been lost by making Smith a somewhat more accessible less crusty character onscreen than he was on the page where ""Silent Toms"" immense uncommunicativeness was the source of notable hilarity when he s tonewalled the press. As it is pics one repository of humor is William H. Macys rat-a-tat very 30s-style turn as a track radio commentator. Elizabeth Banks contributes a radiant elegance and proper period feel as Howards second wife. Vet horseman Chris McCarron who superbly handled the complicated job of designing the race sequences appears onscreen as War Admirals jockey Charley Kurtsinger. Production has been conscientiously appointed in all departments from Jeannine Oppewalls rich production design and Judianna Makovskys vast array of costumes to the wonderful selection of racetracks especially the beautiful art-deco creation Santa Anita where much of the action is set and which still looks much as it did when it opened in 1934. It all shimmers in John Schwartzmans sumptuous widescreen lensing.

It was a too-good-to-be-true story that was true with an underdog Thoroughbred and three unforgettable humans at its center the tenacious hard-luck jockey Red Pollard abandoned by his parents at a young age; the taciturn trainer Tom Smith a Westerner with an almost mystic understanding of the equine psyche and owner Charles Howard who built his fortune selling Buicks and used his salesmans savvy to help turn Seabiscuit into the most popular sports figure two- or four-legged of his time. The challenge in adapting this best seller to the screen is that theres too much good stuff; you could build a whole movie around any one of these guys.Writer-director Gary Ross (""Pleasantville"") homes in on the wounds that these three outcasts shared and finds a tale of salvation how each in his way was healed and made whole by this extraordinary horse. His ""Seabiscuit"" has unusual ambition in this summer season for he also attempts to link their struggle to that of a nation mired in the Great Depression. Its nice to see a filmmaker take the time to root his story in a historical context but sometimes Ross gets a little carried away with his metaphors. Yes Seabiscuit like recent Kentucky Derby winner Funny Cide was a populist hero but to suggest that he was the equivalent of FDRs New Deal may be gilding the lily.Its almost 50 minutes before the title character even makes an appearance. The movie has to cover the rise of Howard (Jeff Bridges) and the death of his son; take Pollard (Tobey Maguire) through his school of hard knocks as a failed prizefighter and half-blind orphan and set up Smith (Chris Cooper) as a solitary horse savior--a somewhat more humanistic and aphorism-prone figure than the gruff inscrutable trainer Hillenbrand described. Their stories are garnished with PBS-style documentary interludes (narrated by the too-familiar voice of historian David McCullough) filling us in on the rise of the automotive assembly line and Depression-era soup lines. Though handsomely elegiac this long prelude feels as generalized as a picture postcard. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The movie achieves traction when Seabiscuit actually hits the track and the three men come together as a team. All the actors are well cast perfectly at ease in their 1930s skins. Maguire achieves a remarkable physical transformation with his wavy red hair rangy body and hollowed eyes hes shape-shifted into a figure who wouldnt be out of place in a Dorothea Lange Dust Bowl photograph. Even Gary Stevens the real jockey proves a natural as Pollards colleague George Woolf who had to step in and ride Seabiscuit at a crucial moment. Rosss one total invention is the hyper radio announcer ""Tick-Tock"" McGlaughlin (Bill Macy) a kind of comic Greek chorus. He liberates Rosss sense of humor which has always been his strong suit. I wish hed let some of that quirkiness into the rest of the movie ""Seabiscuit"" too often unfolds in the reverent tones of a Biblical epic every point underlined every emotion goosed by Randy Newmans predictably plangent Americana score.Whats missing is the funk of the racetrack the stench of the locker rooms the wonderfully specific details of Hillenbrands book. A viewer unfamiliar with racing would come away unaware that horses are handicapped with weights; one of the amazing things about Seabiscuits victories is how big a load he had to overcome. Its oddly unmentioned. Its also curious that Ross doesnt show us the Seabiscuit hats and wallets and parlor games; here was sports merchandising in its early stages. I suspect that a lot was left on the cutting-room floor Seabiscuits transformation from obscure nag to national sensation is strangely abrupt.""Seabiscuit"" may be too airbrushed for its own good but in the end nothing can stop this story from putting a lump in your throat. Every step of the way the odds were stacked against the temperamental undersize colt just as they were against its oversize injury-prone rider. Even if you know the outcome the races have stomach-tightening suspense and the victories stir up a sweet surge of elation. You can say about Rosss epic what you can say about the horse it celebrates it comes through in the stretch.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Comments Seabiscuit Free Rated PG-13  140 minutes Gary Ross the scenarist for Dave and writer-director of Pleasantville tries to fashion another inspirational patriotic myth out of Laura Hillenbrands best seller about a famous racehorse of the mid-1930s and three broken men who find salvation through their association with the quirky equine. Maybe the magic will work for those who loved the book but I found this film stultifyingly self-important and despite the regularity with which it cuts to the chase weirdly static. Jeff Bridges (a former auto tycoon) Chris Cooper (an ex-cowboy) and Tobey Maguire (a driven lonely jockey) know how to hold the right poses and I enjoyed William H. Macy as a hokey radio announcer who accompanies his spiels with sound effects. But Randy Newmans lugubrious score proves that hes become as much a movie hack as Philip Glass and the narrowness of narrative focus thwarts the sprawl and scale required for a proper period epic.

If a nag virtually destined for the scrapheap had achieved all this couldnt the nation slog its way through its difficulties? Thats the notion propounded by this lushly picturesque adaptation of Laura Hillenbrands non-fiction US bestseller. Buried underneath this monument to wholesome all-American self-mythologising is a classy horse-racing picture in the classic mould. Maguire does creditably in an ill-fitting part as the aggressive jockey guiding Seabiscuit to greatness Bridges mixes jauntiness and sobriety as the steeds businessman owner bouncing back from personal tragedy while wise taciturn trainer Cooper and Macys madcap radio commentator contend a photo-finish in the scene-stealing stakes. All good stuff as indeed are the treacle-rich Randy Newman score and vividly persuasive racetrack highlights. But its hard to feel that appreciative when the lightness of touch Ross displayed in Pleasantville has stiffened into such lumbering worthiness. For a film about an unfancied underdog Seabiscuit is just far too pleased with itself.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Casting takes saintly saga Seabiscuit to the winners circleBy Mike Clark USA TODAY Classy and informative even when it needs a bit more clip to its clop Seabiscuit is a coolly rendered impressively crafted telling of a blood-stirring story told by Laura Hillenbrand in her simply grand best seller. Writer/director Gary Ross movie isnt grand but its very good and its so reverent that you can almost envision a sign on the studio wall ""Dont mess with the horse."" A Depression underdog saga the movie also is standout alternative programming to an oft-deadly sequel summer. Putting it over are put-you-there production design and crucial casting that must have made Hillenbrand happy. Review of the movie Seabiscuit ( out of four) Stars Tobey Maguire Jeff Bridges Chris Cooper William H. Macy Elizabeth Banks Gary Stevens Director Gary Ross Distributor Universal Rating PG-13 for some sexual situations violent sports-related images Opens Friday nationwide Three men teamed to turn a horse who was a slow starter at the track into a champ who fleetingly rivaled President Franklin Roosevelt as hero to the downtrodden. They were auto magnate/Seabiscuit owner Charles Howard reeling from the loss of a son; taciturn trainer Tom Smith slightly more of a smiley-face here than in the book; and literate pugilist/jockey ""Red"" Pollard whose life-threatening track injuries made him as much of an underdog as his equine other half. Respectively playing them are Jeff Bridges Chris Cooper and an intentionally thin Tobey Maguire who looks as if he has a tapeworm or two. And fine as they are these actors get strong supporting help as well. Elizabeth Banks conveys warmth as the more compatible second Mrs. Howard and real-life jockey Gary Stevens is a sweet fit as Pollard pal George Woolf who rode Seabiscuit in his make-or-break match at Pimlico against War Admiral in 1938. Employing many scenes that run only seconds filmmaker Ross conveys an amazing amount of information even for a movie that runs more than two hours. Parts of the story like Pollards boozing and his marriage are streamlined or cut but thats understandable. Any reservations stem from the films apparent striving for respectability over unbridled passion. Theres no reason the War Admiral race should be more exciting in PBS Seabiscuit documentary than here. But it is. Fortunately a movie that needs some levity gets a comic boost from William H. Macy as a fictional racing handicapper from the golden days of radio. As if training a horse Macy cues us to laugh every time hes on screen. People who remember radio will probably love this movie and they wont be alone. It remains to be seen whether Seabiscuit has the stuff for posterity -- or even Oscars home stretch. But right now its enough of a pleaser. Pass the oats.

Fall is the most nostalgic of seasons and its sepia tones perfectly fit this very old-fashioned movie about three men a horse and a time long gone by. Writer/director Gary Ross (he wrote ""Big"" and ""Dave"" and made his writing/directing debut with the 1998 fable ""Pleasantville"") has a warmhearted optimism that saturates his movies; they all touch upon themes of hope and old-fashioned decency. ""Seabiscuit"" his first film based on real events does the same -- a horse becomes in the Depression a symbol of happier days to come. There are no villains in this movie (though a scowling rival horse-owner comes close); just some very American heroes wholesome as a shiny red apple. ""Seabiscuit"" View trailer  With Tobey Maguire Jeff Bridges Chris Cooper Elizabeth Banks Gary Stevens William H. Macy. Written and directed by Gary Ross based on the book ""Seabiscuit An American Legend"" by Laura Hillenbrand. 134 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some sexual situations and violent sports-related images. Several theaters. Laura Hillenbrands wonderful nonfiction book was a huge bestseller and not just among horse people -- she vividly depicted the sounds of the pounding hoofs the despair in the eyes of second-tier jockeys struggling for a mount or a meal the almost imperceptible change in a horses gait that can mean a career-ending injury. Her book introduced four unforgettable characters Red Pollard the wizened wary young jockey looking for the perfect steed; trainer Tom Smith an early horse whisperer; Charles Howard the wealthy car dealer who bought a knock-kneed horse nobody wanted; and the Biscuit himself a too-short bay with a healthy appetite and a need to run. Each had his own history leading up to Seabiscuits heyday in the late 1930s and this is where ""Seabiscuit"" the movie cant help but disappoint. The book is thick with details that the movie with only two hours can only hint at. Pollard (Tobey Maguire toughness etched into his pale face) has a haunted look thats only partially explained in the movie. And while Ross takes his time -- and wisely so -- in introducing his characters and bringing them together Seabiscuits rise to fame seems to get short shrift. Ross also makes the unfortunate choice of using David McCullough host of ""The American Experience"" and other television documentaries as a voiceover narrator to the film. Its understandable that Ross wanted to be sure that the story behind the Depression was told that audiences understand why Americans were looking then for a symbol of hope but it gives the movie an educational made-for-television feel and too often brings the storytelling to an abrupt halt. But the movies nostalgic mood is thoroughly beguiling and its likable cast makes up for any shortcomings. Jeff Bridges that most relaxed of actors plays Howard as a backslapping charmer always looking ever-so-slightly amused. Chris Cooper as trainer Smith delivers every line like its a backwoods aphorism (""Try to feel it"" he tells Pollard by way of racing strategy); hes the quiet soul of the film. Maguire always so good at playing desperate thin-skinned boys finds Pollards fierce love of speed and of the misfit horse that became his friend. And William H. Macy as an eccentric radio fast-talker with a Clark Gable mustache provides some welcome rat-a-tat-tat humor. Seabiscuit himself is played by 10 different horses (seamlessly to my eye; perhaps a horse expert could spot the changes) and the race scenes are thrilling. We lean in with the horses as they round the turns; riding with the jockeys as they stretch out over their mounts backs toward the finish. ""Seabiscuit"" doesnt end with a bang or a whimper; it just fades away gently like the dusty light of an autumn afternoon.

Starring Tobey Maguire Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper. Directed by Gary Ross. (PG-13. 145 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The two great virtues of ""Seabiscuit"" are that its an unbeatable story and that writer-director Gary Ross did very little to get in its way. In adapting Laura Hillenbrands wonderful book to the screen Ross surrendered himself to the tale lavishing time on the characters getting the period details right and making the races look authentic. The result is a faithful loving piece of work and the love shows. The film is ambitious. Its the story of a horses career but its also the story of the three men behind the horse as it were -- an owner a trainer and a jockey whose troubled lives were redeemed by their work with Seabiscuit. Whats more the movie aspires to tell a larger American story about a nation in the late 1930s just beginning to regain hope at the end of a long Depression. ""Seabiscuit"" shows how a small underestimated and ungainly horse became a symbol for Americans who saw themselves as underdogs and who wanted to believe in second chances. The film is audaciously languorous in the early going. Just as the book takes about 50 pages to build Ross takes a good 40 minutes to lay the groundwork for what are essentially three separate stories. We meet Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) a San Francisco entrepreneur who makes a mint in the car business; Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) a cowboy and horse trainer whose way of life vanishes as the old West gives way to the new; and Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) a jockey and sometime prizefighter who has to fend for himself after his family hits bottom during the Great Depression. Ross has so much to juggle he sometimes gets lost. The movie starts in 1910; then 21 years pass and its 1929. Interesting. Then six more years pass and were told its 1933. In addition to the personal sagas Ross wants the audience to know about happenings in the country at large and for that he employs David McCullough author and narrator of the PBS documentary series ""The American Experience."" As black and white photos appear and archival films flicker McCulloughs voice-over fills us in about Henry Ford the assembly line the stock market crash the New Deal etc. If the word ""iconic"" would be used about a voice McCulloughs qualifies -- its familiar to millions for his narration of Ken Burns ""The Civil War"" alone. Using McCullough to narrate makes ""Seabiscuit"" feel like a combination narrative film/""American Experience"" documentary. Thats a hybrid that might have been interesting had Ross chosen to take it all the way. As it stands the use of these documentary passages seems unintegrated and clumsy -- not obnoxious certainly but inartistic. Its a half hour before any one of the three principals meets another and by the time they do each has been through the mill including the wealthy Howard whose marriage has collapsed and whose son is dead. Now newly remarried (the movie could have skipped the first wife altogether) he decides to get into racing. His own sorrow draws him to the mystical goodness of Smith and its Smith who finds the ideal jockey Pollard and the ideal horse. For those who read the book the horse as depicted here will inevitably be disappointing. Short thick dark and irrepressible Seabiscuit was both a champion and a character. Alas horse actors are rare and so the movie Seabiscuit (played by 10 different horses) is of necessity less vivid. But the races are fully realized. Much of the films second act consists of the buildup to Seabiscuits fabled 1938 match race with War Admiral an encounter that the movie squeezes for every ounce of drama. ""Seabiscuit"" may sneak up slowly but it inspires powerful emotions. Maguire Bridges and especially Cooper whose performance is just lovely convey the poignancy of men striving for a moment of definition and glory in a lifetime of struggle. That it all depends on something as ephemeral as an animals life and as delicate as a horses legs makes it all the more touching. I found myself choking up at unexpected moments. I wont be the last one. The movies sole black spot is in Ross creation of a fictional character a fast-talking buffoonish radio announcer played by Wlliam H. Macy. Its a classic device of sports movies to use an announcers explanations to push a story along but its too cheap for this movie and the character is a blight on the films tone. If Ross was so desperate to keep the audience informed he could have let McCullough do more voice-over rather than put words into the mouth of an idiot. This strikes me as a resounding hideousness a mind- boggling blunder. But put that aside. Maybe in the afterlife movies will be perfect. Even as it stands ""Seabiscuit"" is the one of the best films of the season. Advisory This film contains some sexual situations and violent sports- related images.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Seabiscuit is gorgeous sappy fluff. Slate Sign In Sign Up Seabiscuit is gorgeous sappy fluff. Seabiscuit is gorgeous sappy fluff. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 25 2003 623 AM Pale Horse The one thing missing from Seabiscuit is ... Seabiscuit. By David Edelstein Tobey Maguire a fine rider The new movie Seabiscuit (Universal) directed and adapted for the screen by Gary Ross has a warm glow. The dirt flies up from under the horses hooves in lyrical slow motion like a spray of gold dust and the light brings out the whites of the jockeys uniforms so that these daring riders are transfigured. With their torsos bent parallel to their horses they seem on the brink of an epiphany a holy union of man and horse. Randy Newmans music is plangent yearning The chords descend yet the notes seem to beckon toward something in the distance--Ill give you 10-to-1 odds its ""the ineffable."" Newman scored The Natural (1984) and as in that film the subtext of every shot is ""Wasnt that a time"" Advertisement A lot of people have been champing at the bit for this movie. Like me they were thrilled to pieces by Laura Hillenbrands best seller about the most celebrated racehorse who ever lived. Hillenbrand told the story of three disparate and traumatized men--multimillionaire Buick distributor Charles Howard (played in the movie by Jeff Bridges) trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) and jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire)--who in the 1930s found a common obsession in a horse no one wanted a smallish misshapen beast with a lazy disposition and an unruly temper. With his ferocious drive--and his relish for not just winning but coming from behind in high theatrical style--""the Biscuit"" would also become the obsession of a traumatized nation. Hillenbrands layers of detail dont slow the story down They put you deep inside the action and the book has an easy canter that accelerates into a joyride. Hillenbrand invokes the pop-culture images of 30s horse racing but chiefly to turn them inside out and expose the grueling reality the poverty; the pitiless treatment of horses; the lack of safety measures for riders; and the jockeys weight-loss rituals that often resulted in illness dementia and death. Director Ross on the other hand is not a grueling-reality kind of guy. Best known for his scripts of Big (1988) and Dave (1993) and for writing and directing the mild meditation on 50s mores Pleasantville (1998) he traffics in clever inversions of pop stereotypes. In Seabiscuit he clearly relishes the 30s bric-a-brac--the angled Stetsons the dated slang the reproduction of images from newsreels. He distills Hillenbrands reporting into folksy narration but it plays like those movies you used to sleep through in history class. Ross is most at home with a character he devised for William H. Macy ""Tick-Tock"" McGlaughlin a radio commentator who speaks in a trebly staccato and wields an arsenal of corny sound effects. He doesnt seem nearly as intimate with his less showy central characters. In Coopers first appearance he grimly surveys the prairie once filled with horses and now defaced by an automobile and a barbed-wire fence. The image--of 19th-century America sadly contemplating the frontiers end--made me groan but fortunately Cooper doesnt have to do anything so mythopoetic again. His trainer--described by Hillenbrand as translucent to the point of invisibility (""When photographed hatless he had an unsettling tendency to blend with the sky so that his eyes hung disembodied"")--is indeed a blur on the screen like the ghost of Richard Farnsworth. But he doesnt have Hillenbrands words to make him so amusing. More vivid is Bridges who gets to do an update of his cockeyed optimist auto magnate in Francis Ford Coppolas Tucker (1988) only with melancholy bass notes. In making his fortune on Buicks Howard crowed that the horse-and-buggy was dead then suffered a bitter tragedy when his 15-year-old son drove one of his cars off the road. Ross makes the son a little kid maybe 7 or 8 I guess he thought we wouldnt be as moved by the death of a teenager. Good as Bridges is its Maguire who dominates Seabiscuit. True with his soft face and faintly morbid shyness hes not the first actor to leap to mind as a wiry hotheaded jockey and incorrigible boxer. But once I got past the strange casting I began to see how impressive the performance was. Maguire has dieted himself down to bone and sinew so that his eyes pop out shining and hungry. Its too bad that Ross didnt write a part for the famed jockey Gary Stevens as George Woolf the ""Iceman"" Pollards buddy and rival and that he limited Elizabeth Banks--coiffed to resemble Kate Beckinsale--to a series of pretty reaction shots as Howards second wife Marcela. (Hillenbrand doesnt write very vividly about Marcela either but Ross could have come up with something.) There is a more vital absence Seabiscuit. I have a horse-nut friend who felt let down by the book because he wanted to read about a horse and not a bunch of people. I think hes a tad hard on Hillenbrand who writes colorfully about both species but he might as well skip the movie in which Seabiscuit is played by 10 different anonymous animals a Seabiscuit for standing for biting for rearing for winning for losing. ... In The Black Stallion (1979) the director Carroll Ballard and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel proved you could photograph a horse to make every ripple of his physique seem expressive without ever anthropomorphizing him. But you look at Seabiscuit and think ""Oh a horse."" Once in a while theres a close-up of his eye to suggest that hes taking everything in but the charged relationship among horse trainer and jockey is alluded to by the narrator without really being dramatized. A couple of pages before the end of the book Hillenbrand tells the story of the last time Hollywood took a crack at the life of the legendary racehorse. The movie featured Shirley Temple and one of Seabiscuits sons who reportedly had his fathers look but was so slow that that he couldnt manage to win against the glorified plow horse theyd cast as his most famous adversary War Admiral. The filmmakers had to scrap the climactic sequence and use newsreel footage of the actual two-horse match. Id like to see that old movie however terrible because the title character might actually be a presence. I dont mean to look a gift horse in the mouth--especially in midsummer between Bad Boys 2 and Charlies Angels Full Throttle. Seabiscuit has some stirring sequences fine performances and not incidentally many excellent hats. The camera plunges you into the middle of the races so that even when you cant tell whats happening--which is usually the case--youre turned on by the speed the streaking horse bodies and the thunderous soundtrack. A scene in which Pollard is horribly injured made me dive under my seat; and the teams attempt at a comeback at Santa Anita is marvelous with a final shot that suspends the action at just the right mythic instant. But the best thing about Seabiscuit is that it will make a lot of people hungry to read the book. Theyve seen the pretty pictures; now theyll want to enter the world. Note The Story of Seabiscuit will be shown on Friday July 25 on Turner Classic Movies. Consult your listings for details.

Hillenbrand in no way slights the victories; her version of the horses improbable path to glory is a story of the wide-open West land of opportunity for the downtrodden triumphing over the snobby hidebound East. But its also a story of the worst economic collapse America has ever weathered and of the insane world of American sports in this case about fully grown men who work and starve themselves to death destroying their bodies and those of their horses to stay in the game while millions of destitute fans float their last pennies on betting slips. Hillenbrand sees inspiration in that -- history after all is seldom made by people of moderation -- but she doesnt flinch from the terrible costs. It will come as no surprise that Gary Ross likable but hopelessly folksy movie which he adapted with market-savvy selectivity from Hillenbrands book skews heavily toward the American dream that will never go away the dream that even in the worst of circumstances anyone with the right attitude can make it big. This is disappointing for though I wouldnt exactly call Ross a titan of radical cultural critique Big and Dave (which he wrote) and Pleasantville (which he wrote and directed) add up to a cheeky 60s-style track record of exploding some of our choicer pieties within the frame of a mass-market movie. Where comedy set free a playful and critical spirit in Ross drama seems to have trapped him in sonorous uplift. Seabiscuit nods dutifully at the catastrophe of the Depression but fundamentally it tidies the material into an old Hollywood standard extolling the virtues of broken spirits who given a second chance can become winners -- given enough grit perseverance and help from self-made millionaires who never forget where they came from. ""You dont throw a whole life away just cause its banged up a little"" is the mantra that flows between Seabiscuits owner Charles Howard a charming car manufacturer with a nose for publicity who went from nothing to riches and (sort of) back again in the stock-market crash; the horses monosyllabic trainer Tom Smith; and his rider ""Red"" Pollard a bright angry kid cut loose from his family by the Depression whos too big and too blind to be a jockey and does it anyway. In fact the four-way symmetry between these three knockabout obsessives and the temperamental knobbly-kneed steed they put their faith in would be the movies fascinating core were it not for Ross uncanny determination to turn them into cartoons. As the impossibly goodhearted Howard (where are those saintly CEOs when we need them?) Jeff Bridges one of Americas most capable and versatile actors has little to do but look pained when anyone suffers and beam good intentions at one and all while his second wife Marcela (Elizabeth Banks) in real life a peppy adventuress is tamed into a compulsively supportive smiler. Tobey Maguire displays a tad more animation than usual as the monomaniacal Pollard while Chris Cooper is almost too perfectly cast as the strong silent Smith who looks at horse and jockey and senses instinctively that two minuses make a plus. Sadly none of them has anything of note to say in a script bogged down in expository aphorism that exacerbated by David McCulloughs droning voice-over (""It was the beginning and the end of imagination all at the same time"") to make sure we get the period significance plays like an episode of The Waltons. Sunk in solemnity Ross spends the first half of the movie industriously lobbing us movie cliches importuning close-ups and endless pounding horses hooves in slow-mo the Depression pictured in reverent black-and-white versus the cornball golden glow that bathes Seabiscuit as he races through autumnal woods. Things liven up a touch when Ross lets his inner comedian out to play -- William H. Macy steals the scenery out from under everyone as he brings a carnival barkers brio to the role of radio sports reporter ""Tick-Tock"" McGlaughlin while jockey Gary Stevens who even has the face of a handsome horse discovers the actor within as Red Pollards suave friend and nemesis George Woolf. Two-thirds of the way through Seabiscuit awakes to its duties as a perfectly presentable race movie rising to a crescendo of satisfying -- if somewhat gaga -- inspiration.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm At the end of her book Hillenbrand caps the climactic race by revealing that George Woolf died at 35 a victim of diabetes and his own excessive dieting. The compulsively honest Smith almost certainly suspended in error by the Racing Commission for the malfeasance of one of his grooms expired in a nursing home with hardly a soul to attend his funeral. Pollard crippled by multiple injuries and poor health care while Seabiscuit lived large on Howards estate ended up sorting mail in a post office and shining the shoes of other jockeys. Perhaps most shamefully of all the Santa Anita Racetrack was retooled as an internment camp for Japanese-Americans during World War II. Seabiscuit the movie stops short of all this reworking itself into a heroic tale of "" the little guy who doesnt know hes a little guy"" and thus becomes a big cheese beloved of all the little guys who didnt make it. This is the kind of tried-and-true Hollywood half-truth that sustains Americas notion of itself as the quintessential open society. Its also a travesty of history and a betrayal of the mass miseries of the Depression. Buffalo Soldiers a self-proCLAIMED satire about American soldiers running amok in peace-time Germany has baggage aplenty going in. In honor of our glorious adventure in Iraq the movie was postponed from its projected spring release apparently less at the behest of the terrible twins Disney and Miramax than of its young Australian director Gregor Jordan who nonetheless professes himself wounded at the threat posed to freedom of speech by military bigwigs who wrote in objecting to the movies negative depiction of American soldiers. Worse yet the movie aspires to profundity. Based on a novel by Robert OConnor about late-Cold War American soldiers rotting of tedium in a German barracks Buffalo Soldiers is inspired if thats the word by Nietzsches observation that ""When there is peace the warlike man attacks himself."" Joaquin Phoenix plays Specialist Ray Elwood a wily supply sergeant who staves off boredom by organizing a black market in everything from Mop amp; Glow to AK-47s right under the nose of his good-natured but clueless commanding officer (Ed Harris against the grain). When a far savvier new top sergeant with the strenuously winking name of Robert Lee (Scott Glenn) shows up to take the helm Elwood tries to keep his business afloat while wooing Lees daughter a self-possessed nymph (and it is snidely implied nympho) played by Anna Paquin. As a portrait of what soldiers will do once a war is won Buffalo Soldiers is probably close to the mark. Time magazine recently had a cover on lootings by American soldiers in Baghdad and almost any self-respecting foreign correspondent will tell you that a certain amount of pillage invariably follows a war. As social satire though the movie is a nonstarter completely lacking in the zany lunacy of MASH and Dr. Strangelove or the whacked savagery of Catch-22. For reasons that never become apparent Jordan elects to play the growing mayhem straight and the movie drags its toneless spiritless way to the edifying conclusion that there is ""no peace anywhere.""

"Seabiscuit | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; seabiscuit ) Seabiscuit (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Seabiscuit is the great hope of the adult movie-going audience a summer motion picture that is not designed to appeal to teenage boys. Ordinarily one might think it would be a risk on Universals part to release the movie in late July but the average viewer is probably ready for something that doesnt feature explosions and chase scenes and Seabiscuit is the kind of inspirational drama that generally plays well 12 months a year. The movie follows a time-honored easily predictable path to victory and redemption. The script is perhaps more high-minded than the material deserves but director Gary Ross understands how to compose a motion picture and even though Seabiscuit is a little on the long side it works more often than not. In short its a nice antidote to the summer blahs. The movie generally follows the outline of Laura Hillenbrands book of the same name which chronicles the story of the racing horse Seabiscuit (one of the great sports success stories of depression-era America). Everyone loves an underdog and this movie has a quartet of them. Theres businessman Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) who made a fortune by selling cars in the Roaring Twenties then lost his zest for life when his son died in an accident and his first wife left him. Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) is a horse trainer who believes in caring for not killing lame animals. Most ""reputable"" racers view him as a fringe lunatic. Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) is a failed boxer and too-tall jockey who has spent much of his life on the streets and bus-stop benches. And Seabiscuit has been a disappointment to nearly everyone who has owned him. Despite a good pedigree he has turned into a consistent loser. After re-marrying Charles turns his interest from cars to horses. Having little knowledge about animals he hires Tom as his horse whisperer. Tom in turn discovers Seabiscuit. He likes the horses spirit and thinks he can be a winner. Tom also brings Red on board believing that he like Seabiscuit can be reclaimed. After re-training the animal to abandon his losers mindset Charles enters him in a race at Santa Anita Park. Soon the underdog is winning races and setting records. At that point Charles sets his sights on a bigger target he wants to race (and beat) War Admiral a Triple Crown winner. After much wrangling the one-on-one match finally takes place in November 1938 at Pimlico (War Admirals ""home track""). Seabiscuit is Rocky in a saddle with Hollywood-enhanced feel-good impulses oozing from every frame. Thats not a bad thing especially if youre a sucker for underdog-triumphant sports movies. Dont be fooled into thinking Seabiscuit is a history lesson - it plays fast-and-loose with some of the facts but one could argue that the changes make for better drama. (For example in the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap Seabiscuit ran second not last for most of the race before coming from behind to win.) The intent of the movie is to show the parallelism between Charles Tom Red and Seabiscuit but it overplays its hand. The connections are too obvious (such as a scene in which both Red and the horse have similar-looking casts on their legs). A little subtlety would have been more rewarding. And I could have done without cornball lines like ""The future is the finish line"" ""Sometimes when the little guy doesnt know hes the little guy he can do big things"" and ""You dont throw a whole life away just cause its banged up a little."" (I suppose its possible to argue that campy dialogue is part of the movies charm.) The acting is on the high level one would expect from this cast. Jeff Bridges is earnest and likeable and bears more than a passing resemblance to the character he inhabited in Tucker. Tobey Maguire looking nothing like Spider-Man does a credible job as Red although this is not Oscar material. The best of the three leads is perhaps expectedly Chris Cooper who despite limited screen time develops Tom into an intriguing and sympathetic figure (one senses he would rather be with horses than people). Seabiscuit is played by about a dozen different horses but to an untrained eye like mine they blend seamlessly. My one complaint is about William H. Macy an actor I greatly admire. Macys over-the-top for-laughs performance as track announcer Tick Tock McGlaughlin is so out of place that it quickly grates. Its like bringing a clown on stage during ""Swan Lake."" As with his previous effort Pleasantville director Ross displays a powerful ability to evoke a time and place. Throughout Seabiscuit we feel like were back in the 30s. This is the most successful sports movie since The Natural in establishing a period piece setting. One could argue that Ross errs in using David McCullough to provide a history lesson as part of his superfluous voiceover narration but younger viewers who know little about the Great Depression may find this contribution useful. When it comes to filming the races Ross elevates the energy level by employing unconventional shots that dont call attention to themselves and avoiding fast cutting that might result in audience confusion. We see plenty of third-person and first-person perspectives. Seabiscuits strongest weakness is not the inclusion of Tick Tock McGlaughlin McCulloughs narration or its manipulative tendencies. Instead its the uneven and occasionally uninvolving first hour. Although necessary to introduce all the characters and establish the circumstances this part of the movie is choppy and emotionally stunted. We are for example supposed to feel deeply for Charles when he loses his son. But its too early and we dont know the character well enough. Eventually Seabiscuit settles into a nice rhythm and as it enters the stretch run it exhibits all the necessary elements of a good sports movie. Like the horse its named after Seabiscuit has a lot of heart and in the end thats what won me over.

Macy; Director Gary Ross (Director); Author Gary Ross (Writer); Release Date Wide 07/25/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 141; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Posted July 23 2003 -- 1200 AM EDT Movie touts desperate for a winner may be forgiven for pinning such high hopes on Seabiscuit. It is after all a rare pedigreed entrant in a summer of mules sired by writer-director Gary Ross out of Laura Hillenbrands marvelous best-seller about a horse born to lose who ended up winning at a time in Americas history when the little guy was in desperate need of a hero who beats the odds. The bay himself descended from Man o War was knobby-kneed and unruly - the legacy of beatings and neglect. His owner Charles Howard was a self-made auto dealer with sadness in his life and a fondness for underdogs. Seabiscuits trainer Tom Smith was a taciturn loner a cowboy more at home with animals than people. And his jockey Red Pollard was a scrappy brawler abandoned when he was a boy too tall for his profession and blind in one eye. Set during the Great Depression and starring wounded men and a wounded horse who get back on their feet after life knocks them down the story of Seabiscuit would make a beauty of a movie even if it were invented by screenwriters. That the tale is true only sweetens the victory and raises the stakes. And Gary Ross - the writer of ""Big"" and ""Dave"" the director who re-created an iconic 1950s America in ""Pleasantville"" a lover of horse racing and politics - knows all this He aims his movie at a more mature more discerning audience than the ""Charlies Angels"" crowd and employs Tobey Maguire as Red Pollard not so much because the grave recessive young actor did superhero box office business in ""Spider-Man"" but because he played a grave recessive young man in ""Pleasantville."" ""Seabiscuit"" trembles with respect for Hillenbrands book. Its hobbled by good intentions grand plans for telling many stories at once and a fear of the very audience whose intelligence and sophistication it claims to court - otherwise why stick so rigidly to the conventions of the square and uplifting when it comes to adapting prestigious literature? If anything Ross takes the ringing ""Rocky""-style American lessons about the common man and the noble horse implied in the fable too much to heart then passes them along to us with such overemphasis that theres nothing for us to discover for ourselves. Even exciting racing scenes - the main event after all filmed with a feel for speed by cinematographer John Schwartzman - are schoolmarmishly interrupted by archival still photographs of Americans rich and poor following the action on that great unifying medium the radio. As if he feared that a handsomely shot movie about men and a horse who defied defeat together wouldnt be moving enough Ross has turned his ""Seabiscuit"" into something less passionate and more hortatory a Ken Burns-earnest essay about the character of America speeches and all. And such speechifying Historian David McCullough - as identifiably the voice of important public-TV productions as Walter Cronkite was once the voice of important network news - narrates a historical overview that reads like plain poetry in Hillenbrands pages but assumes a far more good-for-you tone in voice-over. ""It was the beginning and the end of imagination"" McCullough orates describing the cataclysmic changes wrought by the introduction of the assembly line that built the Model T. (The accompanying score by Randy Newman reinforces that sentiment with swaths of Aaron Copland chords blended with bits of homespun-by-Ralph Lauren Americana.) Jeff Bridges handles the elements of manly maturity and can-do risk taking playing Howard with the same reassuring self-confidence that made him such a fine car guy - and capitalist with a dream - once before in ""Tucker."" ""Where cant we go in America? The sky is literally the limit"" a buoyant Howard declares before his personal life takes a plunge. Meanwhile the folksy speeches exemplifying quiet respect for animal instinct go to Chris Cooper as trainer Smith. Samples ""Hes forgotten what hes born to do. He just needs to be a horse again."" Also ""Every horse is good for somethin."" (We know less about Smith than we do about anyone else; Cooper a model of self-effacement does some of his best work consulting a stopwatch at the track.) Part of Ross challenge is that both Smith and Pollard are such inward contained men that the actors playing them have got to work with the energy of absence rather than presence. And in this Maguire uses his natural wariness like an all-purpose tool. Slimmed down and sinewy his crimped and dyed hair setting off the pallor of his skin his Red is a study in negative spaces. Yet when hes on a horse Maguire becomes a different energized animal - and the whole movie surges ahead. In a small and intrusively shtick-filled fictional role fellow ""Pleasantville"" alumnus William H. Macy plays a tippling radio announcer whose on-air burbling helps hype this legendary horsey-interest story and drum up wagers. A lot of moviegoers have been betting on ""Seabiscuit"" to win.

Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive (CNN) -- In transferring Laura Hillenbrands magnificent best-seller ""Seabiscuit An American Legend"" to the screen writer/director Gary Ross had some amazing material to work with -- a classic underdog story of a horse and his human partners. But the result is at best uneven. Seabiscuit the horse doesnt make his appearance until 50 minutes in. Until then the film feels like an average documentary as the closing of the Western frontier growing American industrialization and the Great Depression are described in strokes large and small. Only then does the story of this amazing horse and three men who found redemption by believing in the impossible get off the ground. The film version stars Tobey Maguire Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper. Those three men jockey Johnny ""Red"" Pollard (Maguire) owner Charles Howard (Bridges) and trainer Tom Smith (Cooper) are the heart and soul of this drama. Magical convergence ""Seabiscuits"" racing scenes are thrillingly filmed. All three had been beaten down by life. Pollards large prosperous family was hit hard by the Depression; at a young age he was virtually abandoned at a racetrack and left to make his own way in the world as a jockey and sometime boxer. Howard was a self-made man who earned millions by selling Buicks to a newly mobilized nation but his life fell apart when his son was killed in a car crash and his marriage failed. Smith was a cowboy -- with a gift for dealing with horses -- who saw his Old West way of life disappear. By happenstance all three lives converged thanks to an undersized racehorse with a funny gait and a big heart -- Seabiscuit. Once the men and the horse are united the film begins to gain traction. The racing scenes are astounding Ross has put his camera in unique places to capture these magnificent animals at unusual angles as they thunder around a racetrack approaching speeds of 50 miles per hour. The acting by all three stars is rock solid Maguire Bridges and Cooper all merge naturally into their roles and actually seem to inhabit their characters. Hall of Fame jockey and first-time actor Gary Stevens plays the pivotal role of George ""The Iceman"" Woolf -- who filled in for Pollard aboard Seabiscuit for a key race -- and hes also very believable. William H. Macy (one of the best actors on the planet) plays the films only fictional character racetrack announcer ""Tick Tock"" McGlaughlin; he brings comic relief to the movie but provides little in the way of advancing the plot. Difficult job Elizabeth Banks plays Marcela who becomes Charles Howards second wife and a key force in his stable. Adapting a book into a movie is always a dicey process. Figuring out what to keep in what to leave out and how to compress information into a dramatic format is not easy especially when the book in question is so rich in detail and information. However its surprising that Seabiscuits huge weight handicap is never mentioned. The fact that the horse was always loaded down with as much as 130 pounds was a big issue in the book but is never mentioned in the film. Also the handling of Pollards blindness in one eye is rammed awkwardly into the story and doesnt gel with reality at all. Despite that nitpicking the film does pick up speed as Seabiscuits legend grows and the odds against him continue to mount. And Ross conveys the incredible danger involved in racing thoroughbred horses in such tight quarters at such high speeds. Youll find yourself rooting for Seabiscuit to cross the finish line first even though the outcome is a foregone conclusion. ""Seabiscuit"" is a good movie but it could have been a great one -- it just misses by a nose. ""Seabiscuit"" opens nationwide on Friday July 25 and is rated PG-13.
