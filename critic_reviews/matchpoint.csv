DreamWorks Pictures hide caption toggle caption DreamWorks Pictures Woody Allen leaves both comedy and New York behind for his new movie Match Point a thriller set in England. Bob Mondello reviews the new film staring Scarlett Johansson Jonathan Rhys-Meyers Emily Mortimer and Matthew Goode. ROBERT SIEGEL host Woody Allens latest movie is a lot of things that most Woody Allen films are not. It is set in London rather than New York. It stars mostly British actors and it is not a comedy. But Bob Mondello says ""Match Point"" represents a return to form for the director. BOB MONDELLO reporting Whod have guessed that a drama about moral choices and luck plain blind luck would turn out to be Woody Allens most satisfying film in years? In the opening moment we see a tennis ball whizzing back and forth across a net and then hitting the top of the net and bouncing straight up. It could fall either way but in agonizing slow motion it falls backwards. A similar bounce ended the tournament career of a young working-class tennis champion named Chris but he figures he can still bounce upward in life by teaching tennis at an uppercrusty London club. He is befriended by one of his first pupils a fellow named Tom who invites him to a party on the family estate where Chris finds a blonde actress playing table tennis. (Soundbite of ""Match Point""; ball bouncing) ""Ms. NOLA RICE"" So whos my next victim? ""Mr. CHRIS WILTON"" I havent played table tennis in quite a while? ""Ms. RICE"" Would you like to play for a thousand pounds a game? ""Mr. WILTON"" What did I walk into? MONDELLO He slams her serve. (Soundbite of ""Match Point""; ball being hit back and forth) ""Ms. RICE"" What did I walk into? ""Mr. WILTON"" So tell me whats a beautiful young American Ping-Pong player doing mingling amongst the British upper class? MONDELLO At about that moment in walks Tom and the plot thickens. (Soundbite of ""Match Point"") ""TOM"" Ah there you are. I wanted to introduce you to Chris Wilton. Chris Wilton this is Nola Rice my fiancee. ""Ms. RICE"" Uh-huh. So youre the tennis pro. ""TOM"" ...(Unintelligible) ""Mr. WILTON"" My pleasure. ""Ms. RICE"" He was trying to have his way with me over the table. ""TOM"" Oh really? Well wed better watch out for this one. Hes made a living out of hustling. ""Ms. RICE"" Ill be ready for you next time. MONDELLO Oh if only. With Nola spoken for Chris falls into an affair with Toms sister and all four of them become more or less inseparable. Alas hes still less interested in his girlfriend than he is in Toms. And when an opportunity presents itself to be alone with her in a pouring rain out of sight of the others he leaps at it. (Soundbite of ""Match Point""; rain) ""Mr. WILTON"" I dont mean to intrude. ""Ms. RICE"" I need a drink. ""Mr. WILTON"" I like it when you drink. You get flirtatious. ""Ms. RICE"" Do I? ""Mr. WILTON"" Yeah and confident. ""Ms. RICE"" I dont think this is a good idea. You shouldnt have followed me here. ""Mr. WILTON"" Do you feel guilty? (Soundbite of thunder) ""Ms. RICE"" Do you? MONDELLO He answers her with a kiss and an awkward situation takes a bounce towards adultery. Now Woody Allen has dealt with adultery before notably in his comedy ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" which shares quite a few plot points with ""Match Point."" But he leavens that movie with laughs. Here hes working with soap opera complications grand opera emotions and jokes that are not designed to prompt many chuckles even when they involve Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals. For Allen whose comic timing as a director has sometimes seemed a bit off of late this turns out to be mostly a matter of adjusting rhythms. The dialogue in ""Match Point"" is just as smart as in most of his films but its delivered in ways that suggests the characters are covering up tension with wit. By the films midpoint theres tension enough for a Hitchcock festival. (Soundbite of ""Match Point"") ""Mr. WILTON"" Why have you been so cold to me? ""Ms. RICE"" I havent been cold. ""Mr. WILTON"" Yes you have. Ever since we came back from the countryside youve been distant evasive. ""Ms. RICE"" Chris ...(unintelligible) be brother- and sister-in-law. ""Mr. WILTON"" Exactly as I pictured you your face. ""Ms. RICE"" Forget it. Its over. MONDELLO Its barely beginning actually. The cast handles the switch from romance to romantic thriller deftly with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson playing worrisome social climbers in ways that keep you guessing. And as that errant bounce of the tennis ball suggested back at the beginning luck plays a central role in ""Match Point"" too in a twist heart-stopping enough to establish that Woody Allen a director who turned 70 years young this month is still very much on top of his game.

Related Woody Allens leading lady du jour Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Match Point"" with Jonathan Rhys Meyers Scarlett Johansson Emily Mortimer Matthew Goode Brian Cox Penelope Wilton. Written and directed by Woody Allen. 124 minutes. Rated R for some sexuality. Several theaters. Woody Allen has woken up. Theres a spark to his new movie ""Match Point"" thats been missing in his work for some time and its the spark of a man whos fallen in love anew. In this case the object of his affection is not his usual New York but another city London whose gray skies and well-mannered Victorian row houses give the film both freshness and elegance. If nothing else ""Match Point"" is a fine illustration of the adage that its always good to get out of town once in a while. But the film a meticulous drama reminiscent of Allens 1989 ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" but with a taut pace all its own offers much more. Its a tale of class temptation and tragedy rendered in the familiar Allen format but with few new twists The literate conversations are delivered in posh accents rather than an Allen-ish stammer; the location shots feature St. James Park instead of Central Park and the Tate Modern standing in for MoMA; and the soundtrack isnt classic jazz but scratchy opera recordings indicating an older and more formal world. Here the central figure isnt an Allen doppelganger but a confident young man on the make Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers devilishly handsome) a former tennis pro who marries into an upper-class British family but cant keep his eyes (and hands) off his new brother-in-laws bombshell fiancee Nola (Scarlett Johansson). ""You play a very aggressive game"" she purrs to Chris in her raspy voice intrigued. Allen meticulously shows us the velvet ropes tightening around Chris. With his marriage to wealthy Chloe (Emily Mortimer) who treats him as if hes a new toy that shes delighted with he becomes part of the Hewett family. Soon hes out shooting with his father-in-law (Brian Cox) in matching hunting vests and tattersall shirts eating caviar in posh bars and hanging out at the familys country house drinking and smoking the rainy afternoons away. Its a new life for Chris and he knows that an affair with Nola means the risk of losing it all -- but he cant keep away and the story grows inexorably darker as Rhys Meyers model-pretty face becomes tighter and harder. The cast members all new to Allens films all do fine work with their carefully drawn characters. Mortimers playgirl an agreeable woman not blessed with self-awareness eyes Chris -- and the world -- without ever really seeing it. ""I dont believe in luck I believe in hard work"" she chirps during a dinner conversation; with the confidence of someone whos never had to work hard. Johansson lusciously costumed in a white halter dress that wouldnt have looked out of place on Marilyn Monroe gives Nola a brittle vulnerability keeping our sympathies as she morphs from sweetness to fury as a cast-aside mistress. And Rhys Meyers previously best known as the hottie coach in ""Bend It Like Beckham"" likewise transforms in the course of the film. He begins as an unremarkable young man whose looks are his best asset; by the end hes climbed the top of a ladder staring coldly down at what he left behind. Though its far from a comedy watching this film is a happy experience -- its a delight to realize that Allen still making a film a year in his 70s has a few more tricks up his sleeve. ""Match Point"" isnt one of his truly great films like ""Annie Hall"" or ""Manhattan"" but its a very good one; a sign that a career that seemed stalled is purring along once more.

You cant miss it and you cant miss the next book he picks up a readers guide to Dostoevsky. The allusion couldnt be more obvious if it were announced with a flashing road sign. Caution Slow down for faulty moral reasoning. Woody Allen has propped up that sign before in the darkly magnificent Crimes and Misdemeanors. There exists no sharper discourse on criminality and responsibility in film than Allens 1989 masterwork and anything he does to revisit the subject is bound to come up short. But I was shocked by how closely Match Point hews to Crimes. Different protagonist (a callow young tennis pro) different setting (upper-crust London) different music (archival Enrico Caruso) different symbols of class and the caprice of living. The films clearest metaphor comes from tennis that moment when a ball accidentally strikes the tip of the net flicking it up for a moment before it falls on one side or the other for a point. ""With a little luck it goes forward and you win. Or maybe it doesnt and you lose"" explains Chris the tennis player depicted with mincing and breathy narcissism by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. So far Chris hasnt had great luck. He grew up poor in Ireland. As a pro he challenged top seeds and lost more a deficit of fate than talent. But then he meets wealthy English scion Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode a model of Rupert Everett high-class dishiness) and his sister Chloe (sweet sympathetic Emily Mortimer) who take a shine to this striver and nudge him along the path toward self-improvement. He quits his job as a tennis instructor and goes to work for the elder Hewett (Brian Cox). He gets spiffy new clothes a spiffy company car a driver. He romances Chloe spurred by fondness and opportunism but not quite love. He knows he could marry her. He knows he can play this game. He knows he can win it. And then Nola. Nola is Toms fiancee played by Scarlett Johansson as a pouty blonde H-bomb who should wear her own flashing sign around her neck (Caution man-eater). From the moment she appears transmitting here-boys across a ping-pong table to a frankly drooling Chris we can tell shes trouble and we can tell he wants it. Obsessive hungry intercourse and tragic entanglements follow. In every scene Allens direction is unflinchingly clear-eyed and its a pleasure being walked through London at the same unhurried pace that hes taken through Manhattan all these years. Instead of Gershwin we have opera to accompany us the soundtrack packed with plaintive virile arias from Caruso (his recording of Georges Bizets Mi Par DUdir Aspro haunts the film). If only it werent all so familiar. I wish Allen had surprised his viewers (or himself) with a fresh new take on Crimes and Dostoevsky. And I wish I hadnt seen the preview ahead of time because it spoils the movies one bloody-enormous plot development and kills much of its suspense. If youre in a theater when it appears either leave or shut your eyes clap your hands over your ears and hum. I dont have a road sign but consider yourself warned. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Nordstrom Rack Clear the Rack Sale Up to 75% off + free...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Woody Allens ""Match Point"" is a too- rare thing a fine film that waxes philosophical about morality ambition and relationships. Among the best of this breed was the directors 1989 ""Crimes and Misdemeanors."" The director has revisited that dark farce with a tragedy - or some icy version of one. One wishes this heady crafted movie - which uses the wobbly trajectory of a tennis ball as a visual metaphor - wasnt quite so heartless. If this undertaking had a little more love so to speak Allen would have won us game set match. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays former tennis pro Chris Wilton. As the movie begins Chris has come to the conclusion that it is better to be lucky in life than good. Hes skilled and certainly handsome enough to become the tennis instructor at an exclusive country club. In an interview he admits to his would-be employer ""I hate the tennis touring thing."" This isnt the last time Chris displays a clear-eyed assessment of his on-court talents. And initially theres a kind of admirable honesty to Chris. As luck would have it one of Chris first students is Tom Hewett. Matthew Goode plays this scion to self-made millionaire Alec Hewitt (Brian Cox). When Chris tries to pay his own way for the outings with the monied Tom it feels more true than ruse. Good fortune smiles even more broadly on Chris. (Or does it? That is one of the quandaries.) Toms sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) falls for Chris - so much so that it seems like Chloe and Chris Tom and fiancee Nola (Scarlett Johansson) can look forward to years of mixed doubles. Its a clever bit of business having Chris and Nola meet over a game of ridiculously competitive pingpong. We understand were seeing a meeting of the minds. So do they. Problem is for all their heated back and forth the flirtation leaves us frostbitten. Allen teases us with a notion of love at first sight. Later he makes it clear ""lust"" is more the point. Even so Meyers and Johansson never exhibit the chemistry to make that desire however combustible believable. This lack of spark is another reason why the movie thinks clearly but dont feel so good. One of the aggravations here is that we never really get to know Chris. His hunger is evident in his regimen of self-improvement (he reads Dosteyevsky; he loves opera). But the source of that deep pang never materializes. As for Nola she shares enough backstory that we grasp her coolness is something of a facade. Both Hewitt parents champion Chris. Mom (Penelope Wilton) remains suspicious and critical of Nola. Its interesting to learn which interloper will win the Hewett trophy mate. Whatever fate awaits Tom he can handle it. At first one fears for Chloe swimming in those shark-infested waters with an open heart. Dont. Of the leads only Brian Coxs businessman remains sympathetic. (Only those collaterally damaged by Chris desperate act get Allens sympathy.) Its intriguing to imagine which lover - because we were as right about that eventuality as Chris and Nola were - will sour on the other first. An unexpected event changes Nolas veneer of invulnerablity. And like Shelley Winters in George Stevens ""A Place in the Sun"" Nola becomes something resembling pure demand. Not only has Allen revisited the themes of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" he has given us a compelling rebuff to Stevens 1951 melodrama of class struggle. Who hasnt watched that film and wished Winters character would just go away so that the dazzling Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor can enjoy their fable? Their beauty blinded us made us want to find a way out. Allen proves that a stunning woman can be just as disruptive to a stunning mans aspirations as frumpy whining Winters was lo those many years ago. Love might be a word used in the game of tennis but Allen has made certain it never has a place in this tale. Indeed the most heart-rending and brilliant moment comes from a ghost we hardly knew. Chilly as it is ""Match Point"" delivers a different set of pleasures.

These days they sound increasingly like confessions. Match Point rides into town on the back of wildly varied notices since it first screened in Cannes last May (the Brits go boo the Yanks say yeah) and is the directors much-reported London movie. With Allens career seemingly stuck in middle gear for at least the past decade this new work certainly benefits from the fresh breeze of a transatlantic trip (initially a financial necessity rather than an artistic departure) - but Matchpoint is probably best enjoyed with memories of better Woody Allen films pushed to the back of your mind. Match Point is a so-so sub-Ripley tale of ambition and deception that is set amid the semi-urbane semi-cultured and very very boring modern English upper classes. It takes its name from a rather laboured tennis metaphor that allows Allen to riff with little revelation on the amoral unpredictable nature of luck as illustrated by a slow-mo opening shot of a tennis ball balancing on the net ready to fall either side. Allens ambiguous anti-hero is Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) an Irish tennis coach in London who adopted the game as a way out of a poor existence. His job introduces him to a wealthy young Chelsea set whose men follow daddy into the City and whose women flirt with running art galleries as a diverting hobby before motherhood.Its this world into which Wilton marries a parallel universe of people with epic CD collections food (baked potato with truffles anyone?) thats yum-yum and mothers who exert worrying control over their sons choice of girlfriends. Greed both material and sexual gets the better of Wilton; he reaps the financial benefits of a marriage to rich-but-nice Chloe (Emily Mortimer) but also strikes up an affair with his wifes brothers ex-fiancee Nora (Scarlett Johansson) who is a feisty American actress who cant get any work (unlike Johansson who will continue to get plenty if she continues to deliver such seductive performances as this). Wilton cant get enough of the good life; he wins a lucrative job in the City courtesy of his father-in-law and precariously juggles a comfortable if dull domestic arrangement with passionate sessions at Noras small flat (complete with baby oil).Trapped in a loveless marriage Wilton is torn between two vices one of the flesh one of the wallet. Nora wants him to leave his wife; but the perks of his new lifestyle (big riverside flat weekends at country homes) just keep on coming. Desperate situations call for desperate measures... Surprisingly considering Allens outsider status on this project its not London or even the language and habits of the Brits that he gets wrong (although when he does slip up he cascades). His cast of refined toffs are recognisable if never likeable and their dialogue is passable if never palatable. And realism is not the order of the day anyway; instead Allen plays this operatic meditation on fate as high theatre allowing for a large measure of coincidental plotting (cue lots of bumping into each other in the street). But its not enough to rescue an ending that is lazy ludicrous and disastrously leans on the weakest of twists as revealed in an ill-conceived epilogue featuring Ewen Bremner and James Nesbitt as police detectives. The main problem is that in dramatic terms its all rather inert. Rhys Meyers fails to dig deep into the ambiguity and complexity of his character. Is Wilton simply evil? Or should we feel that the unreasonable demands of the clawing world in which he lives partly justify and drive his actions? Its difficult to care. Rhys Meyers pouts his way through the film ably assisted by a nice line in V-neck cashmere jumpers never offering us a character interesting enough to consider. His behaviour might become increasingly extreme and rash yet we feel hes backed himself into a tight corner rather than constructed an entirely false existence that can only be resolved with violence. Theres a pleasing sense of social claustrophobia - but its not enough to make Allens film work.

Try differentiating how your characters express themselves. Try learning how people without wealth live or even acknowledging that a lack of money isnt something to be ashamed of. Try not to pepper your films early on with obvious quotes and references that give away the plot early on for anyone else who has ever read a book. Your later films are so poor it makes me doubt whether Im remembering the earlier ones I like correctly.

Woody has done well to leave New York for London. Hes back in the game with Match Point. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Match Point Drama. Starring Jonathan Rhys-Meyers Scarlett Johansson Emily Mortimer and Matthew Goode. Written and directed by Woody Allen. (R. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Match Point"" is Woody Allens most satisfying film since ""Bullets Over Broadway"" (1994) and his most compelling since ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (1989). Philosophically and plotwise its right in line with some of his previous work. Yet ""Match Point"" breaks new ground in a handful of significant ways For one there is no Woody Allen surrogate. For another he gets out of New York and something about being in London and using British actors frees him of the tics and cliches -- the barnacles -- that have accumulated around his art. At the same time -- and longtime Allen fans especially will find this interesting -- ""Match Point"" shows that even when Allen seemed to be stagnating he was growing. In ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" ""Hollywood Ending"" and ""Melinda and Melinda"" Allen explored a staccato style of quick pointed scenes that began in action advanced the story and then just as quickly ended. Not one of those films had a story that could reveal the effectiveness of that approach but ""Match Point"" does. And with it Allens mature technique comes into focus Direct clipped unsparing. ""Match Point"" is plot driven not character driven and generous in the sheer amount of story presented. It follows the social climb and romantic tribulations of an Irish tennis pro-turned-instructor who comes into the inner circle of a fabulously wealthy English family. Through his work at a posh London tennis club Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) meets Tom (Matthew Goode) happily rich and blithe who takes a liking to him. Tom brings Chris to his parents box at the opera where Chris meets Toms sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chloe falls in love with Chris almost immediately. ""Match Point"" is a film that deserves a second viewing. Allen covers a lot of story very quickly and at first glance theres a tendency to look upon Chris as a fellow to whom things simply happen. In fact as played by Meyers Chris always is aware of his opportunities and always is playing a kind of mental tennis with people. He may not have a grand design but he always knows where he is placing the ball and what he hopes to achieve. This quality though subtle is there from the beginning and so it should not come as a jolt when Chris visiting his rich new friends in their home suddenly makes a bold play for a young woman within seconds of meeting her. The electric encounter between Chris and Nola (Scarlett Johansson) over a ping-pong table is Allens answer to ""A Place in the Sun"" in which Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor did their mating dance over a pool table. In this case both parties are poor and off-limits Nola a struggling American actress turns out to be Toms fiancee and Chris is about to embark on a relationship with Toms sister. But the attraction is there. Nola and Chris recognize the climber in each other as well as a certain desperate life force that their partners raised in comfort lack. Theyre also the most kissable people in the movie with the best mouths. It might seem as if Ive revealed a lot of the story of ""Match Point"" but be assured Ive told very little just enough to identify Johanssons role in the action. Ill stop here except to make the general note that theres no out-guessing ""Match Point"" that the movie goes its own way always fascinating often skipping months and even a year at a time without making a fuss as if maintaining an intense yet detached scrutiny of the characters. Unlike a Bergman film ""Match Point"" is not about emotions not really; rather its the conveyor of an ultimately simple philosophical proposition about the all-important role of random luck in life and thus the implicit absence according to Allen of any overarching moral order. Despite that the strange fierce detachment of its gaze calls to mind Bergman. The film contains references to Dreiser Strindberg and Dostoyevsky and these references are more than just clever. Theyre all there for a reason though trying to figure the specific reasons will keep viewers busy until the finish. Allen never reveals more than necessary. Even the genre cant be identified until the finish Is it a noir? A class study? A romance? A tragedy? Even once its over its not easy to categorize. In a film as constructed as this one the actors are secondary but theyre important. As Chris trusting lover Mortimer acquires a loveliness as she goes along. She does this willfully. This is an attractive actress who subtly galumphs through her first scenes and just as quietly transforms. Johansson by contrast is a powerhouse from the word go. The role calls for sexiness but also demands a lack of vanity and Johansson hits every note. She has a (slightly) drunken scene with Meyers in which she so perfectly conveys the thought processes of her character both muddled and sharp that she borders on astonishing. But Meyers is the one. He is in almost every scene and even when it looks as if hes not hes doing much hes doing plenty. In between getting caught up in the story take time to appreciate the understated specificity of Allens craft and of Rhys-Meyers performance. Its worth it. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations.

(CNN) -- Manhattans most ardent ambassador has left the building.Woody Allen known for creating visual love letters to New York in all his movies has crossed the pond and set his latest ""Match Point"" in London. The location move was based on financial reasons but it has seemed to give him a new lease on life. ""Match Point"" is his best film in years.Jonathan Rhys Meyers (""Bend It Like Beckham"") plays tennis pro-turned-instructor Chris Wilton. Hes a highly ambitious young man who firmly believes that chance and luck -- not to mention being in the right place at the right time -- determine your destiny.As luck would have it while working at an exclusive tennis club Chris befriends his first pupil Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). Hes a to-the-manner (and manor)-born young man who happens to have a beautiful sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) who is instantly smitten with the handsome tennis player.Chris is also instantly accepted by Tom and Chloes parents who admire his resolve and drive. Soon Chris and Chloe are on the fast track towards marriage.There is just one hitch. Chris is deeply attracted to Toms American fiancee Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). However Nola and Tom break up and she drops out of their lives.Chris luck continues after he marries Chloe and her father puts the young man to work for his company. All of Chriss dreams now seem to be within reach.Then through a chance meeting he hooks up again with Nola and they start a torrid affair. At this point things begin to become extremely complicated. It seems that Chriss luck is about to run out. But without giving away any more of this delicious plot -- the screenplay was written as usual by Allen -- lets just say nothing goes the way you think it will.This is a wonderfully provocative film with complex characters and breathless twists and turns. The performances are terrific. The enterprising Chris has a dark side but Rhys Meyers maintains the audiences sympathy even when his behavior isnt the most ethical.As for Johansson shes as alluring and beautiful as always. But she has more Its amazing that an actress this young has such a strong sophisticated presence on the screen. Her character also walks a tightrope between being sympathetic and contemptible and Johansson steers Nola through these dark waters with great skill.Finally back to Allen. The man is as reliable as a New York train conductors pocket watch Going back at least to the mid-1980s each year weve been able to depend on a new Woody Allen film. But making commercial movies has never interested Allen; he always seems to be testing himself and has attempted various film genres not always with success. Indeed many of his recent attempts have failed at the box office and with critics.However ""Match Point"" reverses that trend. It is truly one of Allens best.Would you rather be lucky than good? The answer may surprise you.

It is not a comedy not even slightly.Allen is so identified with New York City that whenever he ventures outside it to make a movie its headline news. ""Match Point"" his latest was filmed in London (hes already filmed a second project there) but the reasons have more to do with artistic freedom than aesthetics. In an interview in the latest issue of ""Written By"" the Writers Guild of Americas magazine Allen says ""I might work abroad a little bit unless I can find a situation in the United States where theyll let me make my movies the way I can make them.""In terms of its story there is no compelling reason why Allen could not have set ""Match Point"" in New Yorks Upper East Side (his neighborhood) but the change of scenery has done him some good. If the American studios are less amenable to Allens cloistered control-freak working methods these days he seems to have made up for it ""Match Point"" is his best film in some time although it should be pointed out that it is his only good film in some time. Even ""Match Point"" suffers by comparison to its obvious predecessor ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" which explored similar moral issues more profoundly. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Still the film is good enough that you dont feel the need for a few laughs to leaven the grimness. Its about the role that luck plays in determining fate. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 At first you wonder why Allen has chosen this particular story to play out his claims for the fickleness of fortune. After all Chris is a master manipulator whose gamesmanship is even higher off the court than on. Even the people who are on to him like Nola are enthralled. He cons the con artists.But Allens point soon becomes clear If someone like Chris can become waylaid by the vagaries of life then it can happen to anyone. If he can get away with his treacheries then where is justice? What links this film with ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is the idea that without justice there can be no meaning in the universe.I dont mean to make all this sound more highfalutin than it is although I could have done without the shot of Chris boning up on ""Crime and Punishment."" Dostoevsky this aint. Allen is foremost an entertainer and he keeps the ruminations mostly to a minimum. But the existential pall shrouding this film is a bit much. It is possible after all to make a movie about fate and retribution and meaninglessness without having it seem quite so much like a demonstration however artful of a philosophical conundrum.It helps that the film is shot in smooth sensual tones. Chriss lustfulness irradiates the atmosphere. His scenes with Nola have a carnal shimmer that is new to Allens movies which are usually cold to the touch. Rhys-Meyers and Johansson work well together - they both know how to project glossiness and guile. The others actors including Brian Cox as the businessman patriarch and Matthew Goode as his spoiled rich son hit just the right note of desiccated good breeding. Allen himself remains off screen which is fine with me. It would be too sordid watching him capering after the lovelies on those manicured lawns. Grade B+ Rated R for some sexuality.

"Woody Allen in London. Slate Sign In Sign Up Woody Allen in London. Woody Allen in London. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 3 2006 310 PM London Calling In Match Point Woody Allen finally leaves Manhattan. By Stephen Metcalf 30 serving love Match Point is a good movie--a good solid movie. Rap it with your knuckles and unlike many recent holiday trinkets from Woody Allen it wont sound hollow. For this oaken solidity we can thank some wise decision-making Woody Allen absents himself entirely from Match Point--he doesnt appear in it and no one in it is even remotely his schnooky alter ego. He also absents Match Point entirely from Manhattan--it takes place in high-society London and its environs. Truth is even Woodys core devotees needed a change of scenery a shift in routine and in this cool poised and very Anglophilic quasi-thriller they certainly have it. Gone are jazz psychotherapy and the Upper West Side; in their place are opera sang-froid and Belgravia. Early on our hero stares into a copy of Crime and Punishment and ones heart sinks. (For a man who has said he reviled his formal schooling Allen has a peculiar taste for freshman seminarese.) But then it quickly rises He drops the Dostoevsky and picks up a Cambridge Companion to Dostoevsky instead. Its a nice joke but when the opening-day audience I sat in giggled it was half in relief. The self-improving gent in question is Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) a still-young Irishman who has recently retired as a professional tennis player. When we meet him Wilton is a beautiful and humble and circumspect man in his late 20s or early 30s. He applies for and gets a job as a pro at an ultra-posh Wimbledon-like club where he meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) a young equally beautiful upper-crust Brit. Wilton is a bootstrapper--tennis was his way out of the lace-curtain poverty of his Irish childhood. Tom is a toffs toff the product seemingly of generations of Oxbridge and disciplined leisure. The early scenes of Match Point in which the two men become fast friends first over tennis then over drinks are as luscious and promising of wickedness to come as a summer afternoon in a Henry James novel and Allen presents them with the self-assured suavity of an old master. As Wilton slowly works his way into the Hewett family bosom Allens lens becomes more loving This is a bosom much to be admired after all what with the Hewetts infinite wealth their infinite refinement and a gentle old patriarch still an active captain of British industry. It is alas not the only bosom worth admiring. Toms fiancee is Scarlett Johansson playing a young American actress named Nola. Advertisement Johansson brings the spirit of Hollywood with her wherever she goes these days and Match Point is no exception. She has grown up so fast (too fast?) from the little anomic mallrat from Ghost World to self-conscious Hollywood royalty with a permanent magic-hour glow now ladled over her like au jus. There is something faintly ignoble about falling in love with her too quickly a fact that Allen manipulates to great effect. ""All men who see you want to attack you"" is how her fiance Tom indelicately puts it and Allen presents Johansson as a coolly reposed if dumbfounding sex object that Wilton the Irish arriviste decides he must possess. But the ante has been upped Wilton has already married into the Hewett family taking the hand of Toms sweet but awkward younger sister Chloe. He has won the affections of the patriarch (another perfect tone-setting performance from Brian Cox). And thanks to the patriarch he has a new career working his way up the corporate ladder. Like Henry James before him Allen has gone to England to make a comedy of someone elses manners. But he has loaded it up with something James never had any time for some bewitching hooey about lucks place in the cosmos and the metaphysics of guilt. Allen has been stewing over these Big Ideas since at least Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) and much of Match Points balder ruminations are lifted directly out of the earlier film. Match Point is a tauter film and there is mercifully little of the dashed-off speechifying that often mars Allens movies. But even with all its cool sinuous elegance the movies wickedness is finally too generic its comedy of social manners smudged by a need to obsessively revisit pet themes. The compelling question--once youve had grouse-shooting and boxes at the opera how do you go back to blonde bookcases Venetian blinds and woks?--finally gives way to dull standbys What if life is totally unchoreographed by any higher power? What if the soul--if it can be said to exist at all--is totally coterminous with the body? What if there is a heaven but you cant get a pastrami on rye after midnight? Stephen Metcalf Stephen Metcalf is Slates critic at large. He is working on a book about the 1980s. OK this last is conspicuously absent from Match Point but its absence and the structure of the classic Woody Allen joke--Not only is God dead but try getting a plumber on the weekends--tells us something about the arc of Allens career and why he has ended up peeping in on English aristocracy. Allen grew up a sweet kid in the outer boroughs at a great distance from both money and culture. His great anxious fantasy about New York City has been that somewhere out there lie little pockets of Shangri-La where money and culture go together and with a lovely ease. His two incomparable skills as a filmmaker havent been comedy and tragedy so much as an ability to bring outer-borough incredulity to bear on the merely pretentious (""Oh thats funny because I happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here"") while still summoning up an immense affection for the parlors of the extremely fortunate. Taken as a group Allens films are the most complete love poem to modern New York City there is. Paradoxically Match Point is that poems final stanza. In the London of the hyper-rich Allen gives us the last window his Coney Island nose can push up against now that he himself is a cultural icon with a mansion (recently sold) on the Upper East Side. But how much has dropped away in the process? Coney Island Manhattan a plumber on the weekends. And so also paradoxically Woody Allen is being overpraised for having made a movie that feels nothing like a Woody Allen movie. The implication lurking behind so many of its glowing reviews has been What a relief that all the tics are finally gone Match Point starts out crisply and deliciously but in the end its a chess problem crossed with an ethics exam. I wanted to know so much more about what its like to be poor to want to be rich and to feel the force of a sexual grippe that would make you piss it all away. What do we get instead? A fact pattern lifted from Dostoevsky and soaked in nobodys warm blood. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson are two of the stars in Woody Allens Match Point. DreamWorks Match Point (   out of four) is an often riveting drama set in London amid the lives of the rich and cultured -- highlighted by an operatic score. And its proof that Allen who many have dismissed with his last few forgettable films is still a filmmaking force. If his name werent on the credits you might never associate this film with Allen. The closest antecedent is 1989s Crimes and Misdemeanors but that had a decidedly American accent. Jonathan Rhys Meyers who played Elvis Presley in this years TV movie and retains the trademark upper-lip sneer is Chris Wilton an Irish-born tennis pro befriended by the wealthy and charming Tom Hewett (a wonderful Matthew Goode). The handsome Chris is quickly taken into the Hewett family fold. Not as easily absorbed into the posh familys good graces is Nola (Scarlett Johansson) Toms fiancee. Nola the daughter of an alcoholic single mother is heatedly disliked by Toms controlling mother (Penelope Wilton). When Chris first encounters the sexy Nola he develops a strong attraction to her but embarks on a relationship with Chloe Toms sunny sister (a superb Emily Mortimer). Tom breaks up with Nola and marries someone else. Chris marries Chloe who enlists the aid of her affable father (Brian Cox) to get Chris a job and help him up the corporate ladder. Chris appears the picture of a lucky man his comfortable life as smooth and unruffled as can be imagined. Perhaps its all a little too easy. Chris complicates things by embarking on an affair with Nola who grows increasingly upset when he refuses to leave his wife. Things go downhill from there. The film dissects the importance of luck and its capricious nature. Chris is the recipient of fortune. Nola appears not to be. Allen does a fine directorial job perhaps invigorated by a milieu that is light-years away from his usual one. The actors particularly Mortimer Rhys Meyers and Goode give strong performances. The talented Johansson is a bit one-note in the femme fatale role though perhaps that is as Allen intended. The film drags somewhat and Allen doesnt seem to know when to end it. But overall one of his few films set on the other side of the Atlantic is a captivating story of class distinctions that evolves into a chilling psychological thriller. (Rated R for some sexuality. Running time 2 hours 4 minutes. Opens Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles.)

DontA,A read other reviews of ""Match Point."" To mention the films it resembles or even to say what its about would be to reveal too much. Its many pleasures derive from the way this drama unfolds unexpectedly from the characters rather than imposing itself on them. This is a stunning debut from a tightly controlled new writer-director. His name is Woody Allen. Of the 35 1/3 films (including ""Oedipus Wrecks"" in ""New York Stories"") he has directed this is the least Woody Allenish of them all. Shooting in London for the first time on the BBCs dime - his recent flops got him chased out of the States the way a barfly is sent headfirst through the saloon doors for not paying his tab- seems to have restarted his career. The flourishes that turned into tics and finally flailings are gone. ""Match Point"" is a meditation on luck that crystallizes in an image set by the Thames near the end of the film. The shot is so perfect that the audience gasps and its quiet power rivals that of the greatest moments ever put on film. Itll be replayed for decades to come. But it wouldnt mean anything without the methodical and ingenious steps Allen takes to set it up. This is the story of a young Irish tennis pro named Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who used to play Agassi. If a couple of bounces had gone the right way hed have been a champion. Instead he is reduced to teaching the basics at a posh London tennis club. By chance though he becomes friends with a wealthy client named Tom (Matthew Goode) who introduces him to his world of hunting estates and champagne cocktails. Toms sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) likes the look of Chris and the three of them flit about London with Toms smoldering American fiancAC/a,!A!e Nola (Scarlett Johansson) a failing actress. So theres ambition class sex and money stewing in a vat of gin and tonics. Several things could go wrong. The movie is a career-making breakthrough for three young actors. As Chris the tennis pro Rhys Meyers is exceptional perfectly under control but a little too polished. He reads a few pages of Dostoyevsky then immediately turns to a book about Dostoyevsky for explanations. Tom needles him by addressing him not as Chris but as ""Irish"" which is a bit like calling him ""Hillbilly."" But Chris seems to have scrubbed away his native accent and he has wisely cultivated a taste for opera. Rhys Meyers is Irish too though you wouldnt know it. After a decade of mostly forgettable work this actor has at last come blazingly into his own. Playing the posh Tom Goode makes an impact similar to the one Jude Law made in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" Hes funny and charming with a cigarette stuck to his lower lip and a smile that curls up at the ends like the Grinchs. Goode hasnt done much of anything before but remember his name. Mortimers role isnt as juicy as the two mens but she also makes a major statement as Toms sister. Whether playing tennis with Chris or peeking at him during an opera she looks softly vulnerable and girlish yet emboldened by the confidence that only money can bring. Johansson is perhaps the weakest of the four leads particularly in the second half when her performance becomes one-note. But in a scene where she gets drunk after yet another failed audition she is devastatingly flirtatious. Asked whether she lives up to her looks she replies ""No ones ever asked for their money back."" It only takes one amazing scene to win an Oscar nomination and this is hers. ""Match Point"" is so cunningly designed particularly in its crucial final act that its a shame that one major loose end is left dangling. Were it not for that flaw - a substantial one I wont mention - Id call it a perfect movie.

Match Point is a perfectly presentable entirely unremarkable domestic melodrama parked queasily between opera and realism two irreconcilable forms if ever there were. Lest there be any doubt that Allens theme is the power of luck over planning in shaping everyday fortune the movie opens on a tennis ball sailing back and forth until it hits the net and drops to one side thus heralding big changes in the life of Chris Wilton (smoky-eyed Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) a former tennis pro who now makes his living as a tennis instructor to the idle rich of Belgravia. Two hours of more soap than opera later with a crackly old Enrico Caruso recording playing constantly on the soundtrack for emphasis a wedding ring hurled impetuously into the Thames lands instead on a parapet then bounces to the ground sealing Chris fate once more. In between theres a pile of plot that wouldnt look amiss on The Young and the Restless laced with some Agatha Christie bits of business involving a hunting rifle all in a WASP London setting as glamorized as WASP Manhattan invariably looks in a Woody Allen movie. Having befriended Tom (Matthew Goode) a tweedy trust-funder with too-too-mahvelous diction and a whopping mummy complex Chris takes up with Toms sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) an eager girl (you could hardly call this clingy simpering eyelash-batting creature a woman even though she does something important with art to make the time pass) whos long overdue for commitment. Pretty soon Chris enters into an affectionate if passionless marriage; a high-flying job in the gleaming corporate offices of Chloes daddy (a peculiarly cast Brian Cox buried in ginger beard); and an affair on the side with Toms fiancee Nola (Scarlett Johansson) involving the kind of sex only a virgin schoolboy imagination could produce with a straight face -- heaving chests ripped shirts blindfolds. In his early films Allen would have been all over this crew lampooning their snobby ways and introducing a disruptive Jew with no social graces to foul up the quiet elegance. Now theres a wistful outsiders longing in the warm amber light in which he bathes the city and when Chris -- a poor excuse for an outsider who fits in mighty quick -- hangs out at the Saatchi Gallery shops at Cartier and runs down to the country house on weekends for a nice bit of shooting you get the sense that Allen would join the party if only his kind of people were allowed in.In the end Match Point is less about the vagaries of chance than about that old standby human folly -- in principle a far more interesting subject than luck about which Allen has little to say other than that sometimes it allows you to get away with (among other things hes all too familiar with) murder. Like its kissing cousin Crimes and Misdemeanors a film that won me over on the first viewing and repelled me on the second Match Point is superficially set up for moral inquiry. As in that film too Allen would have us identify less with the agonies of a crisis of conscience -- for all his adoration of Bergman Ive never bought him as a serious moralist let alone a probing psychologist of bourgeois guilt -- than with the pleasures of sinning without accountability. Sure Chris sweats a little while lying deceiving cuckolding and prevaricating his way through his run of good fortune but not even a couple of deus ex machina ghosts shoehorned in to drive home the consequences of his actions can put much of a dent in his rotten behavior. How telling that in the press notes Allen describes his protagonist as ""like every man out there -- given the right situation any man would be tempted to cheat on his wife or girlfriend if the woman of his dreams walked in.""That the woman in question turns out on closer inspection to be not just a siren with fatal attraction written all over her but a raging neurotic is more a symptom of Allens raging ambivalence toward women -- even the dumb sexpots who have peopled his recent work -- than an instance of beware what you wish for. Whether as florid opera or as realist drama Match Point is less a tragedy than an opportunity for Allen to crow over a man who no matter how egregious his sins gets off with scarcely a scar. There were signs of souring in his view of human nature (Interiors and the horrible Stardust Memories) even in his glory years and Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) laid the groundwork for a long slide into the rancid cynicism that has marked his work ever since. Allen turned 70 two weeks ago and seems to have made a happier life for himself in recent years though God only knows at what cost to others. But its sad to contemplate that well likely never see another Annie Hall a Purple Rose of Cairo a Manhattan or even a Radio Days in his lifetime.MATCH POINT | Written and directed by WOODY ALLEN | Produced by LETTY ARONSON GARETH WILEY and LUCY DARWIN | Released by DreamWorks | Opens December 28 at selected theaters A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Contact Ella Taylor Follow L.A.

"Match Point | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; match-point ) Match Point (United States/United Kingdom 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli In my review of Woody Allens previous misfire Melinda and Melinda I wrote the following ""Lately Allens films have sunk into a state of heightened mediocrity - sporadically entertaining but often disappointing at least for those clinging to the hope that Allen will return to form. I no longer expect great things from a Woody Allen moviea|"" Indeed it has been over a decade since Allen has produced a memorable motion picture. Match Point puts an end to the drought and does so in an impressive and unexpected fashion. Not only could one argue that this is the best ""serious"" work the director has ever attempted but its presented in a way that even the most seasoned Allen fan will have difficulty recognizing the iconic filmmakers fingerprints. Some of the differences are immediately evident Allen does not appear on-screen the setting has been shifted from New York to London and the cast and crew are predominantly British. Other aspects although no less important are more subtle. Allens usual ""voice"" is absent. Match Point does not deal with a neurotic character and there are no May/December romances. The comedy is minimal. This is a character piece that develops into a slow burn thriller. And Allen proves himself to be a master of misdirection. I thought I knew how Match Point was going to end; I was wrong. Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a retired pro tennis player who has signed on to be a tennis instructor at a posh British club. One of his first clients is Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode) an affable fellow who invites Chris out for a night at the Opera when he discovers that he and Chris share some of the same tastes (opera classic novels etc.). There Chris meets Toms family his father Alec (Brian Cox); his mother Eleanor (Penelope Wilton); and his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris and Chloe begin seeing each other and its not long before Chloe falls for the dashing athlete. Chris feelings are more reserved - he feels affection for Chloe but no great passion but he recognizes the kind of stepping stone that a liaison with the Hewitt family could represent. Enter Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) Toms headstrong American fiancA(c)e. Chris is immediately smitten. Even as he woos Chloe with the intention of marrying her he becomes obsessed with Nola. And as with any romantic house of cards this one seems destined to collapse spectacularly. Without giving away plot details that are best discovered by the individual viewer I cant say much about the films final act except to note that its much different from what comes before it and thats what elevates Match Point from a solid character-based story to a near-masterpiece. No Allen movie since Crimes and Misdemeanors (16 years ago) has left as lasting an impression. In an era when the filmmaker has churned out one disposable motion picture after another its a welcome surprise to find a gem like Match Point lurking in multiplexes. This is Chris story and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Bend It Like Beckham) is perfectly suited to play the part. Although there are less-than-laudable aspects to his character Meyers plays Chris with sincerity. Hes a flawed but not evil individual. Theres a little of Stephen Glass (Shattered Glass) in him. Hes a sycophant social climber whos not beyond using a little groveling to ingratiate himself with someone who advance his opportunities. And he has a genuine almost pathological need to be liked. Meyers shows no difficulty handling the demands of this complex character. Emily Mortimer and Scarlett Johansson show different faces of womankind. Mortimers Chloe is the nurturing supportive female one who takes her husbands denial of an affair at face value and whose primary goal in marriage is to give her parents grandchildren. Its a role that Mortimer slides into without difficulty. Johansson on the other hand is simultaneously self-sufficient and needy. The qualities that attract Chris to her are the ones that make the potential of a long-term relationship harrowing. This gives Johansson an opportunity to show a little of the femme fatale. Experienced British thespians Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton have supporting roles as the matriarch and patriarch of the Hewitt clan. One of the most keenly observed elements of Match Point is the way in which it shows how infidelity can erode a marriage. Most movies that delve into this subject do it in a heavy-handed melodramatic fashion. Allens approach is quieter and has the ring of truth. We are taken through the stages of the affair its passionate beginnings the slide into routine and the growing gap between whats real and what the characters want. For Nola it becomes a question of whether Chris will leave his wife. For Chris it becomes a question of whether he can give up his comfortable lifestyle for a woman who makes him feel but may be unstable. Had Match Point simply been about the Chris/Nola/Chloe triangle and the way the deceptions and willful ignorance impacts all three lives it would have been a compelling motion picture. But Allen takes things to the next level and thats what makes Match Point memorable. For the first time in a long time we understand why Allen is considered a master. If this is what filming in London does for him maybe he should move there permanently.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Making his first film in the U.K. with a story originally conceived for New York Allen once again takes up issues of morality and guilt in what amounts to ""An English Tragedy."" Well-observed and superbly cast picture is the filmmakers best in quite a long time. This review was updated at 231 p.m. A change of scenery does Woody Allen a world of good in ""Match Point."" Making his first film in the U.K. with a story originally conceived for New York Allen once again takes up issues of morality and guilt in what amounts to ""An English Tragedy"" as in Theodore Dreiser. Well-observed and superbly cast picture is the filmmakers best in quite a long time and as such reps an attractive potential acquisition for a U.S. distrib keen to break Allens recent string of B.O. flops. Although the script is spiked with mordant humor the prevailing serious mood is underlined by doom-laden laments from Italian grand opera and refs to Dostoevsky Strindberg and even Andrew Lloyd Webbers dramatically similar ""The Woman in White."" In thematic terms ""Match Point"" whose tennis allusion reflects a preoccupation with the role of luck in life comes closest to ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" among Allens films. First 45 minutes constitute marvelous social and romantic comedy-drama. With the action set squarely among Britains young upper crust tale has the debonair Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) taking on Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers the Elvis of the moment) as a tennis coach at his exclusive club. Chris is fresh off the pro tennis circuit where he did well but never broke through to the winners circle. Although identified as Irish the terribly attractive athlete speaks with an impeccable posh accent that allows him to fit in seamlessly with Tom and his set. Since Chris background is never further explored memories of notable works about calculated upward mobility from ""Washington Square"" to ""Room at the Top"" stir up initial questions as to how much of a schemer Chris may be. But in every respect he seems sincere evincing an honest interest in serious literature and opera tastes that ideally suit Toms attractive sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) who a bit over-eagerly takes Chris under her wing and into her bed. With Chris road to success now all but paved with clover theres got to be a snake in the underbrush and it comes in the dazzlingly sexy form of young American Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) whos Toms girlfriend but who strikes immediate sparks with Chris. An obvious tinderbox of trouble Nola is a moody neurotic with a past who drowns her frustration over a stalled acting career with constant drink. Fully aware of its ill-advisability nothing can prevent these two pillow-lipped sex objects from getting down to it which they do during a downpour in a literal roll in the wheat during a weekend in the country. Suddenly however Nola is history gone from Toms and Chris lives and apparently from London as well. Chris and Chloe marry much to the delight of Hewett family patriarch Alec (Brian Cox) who continues to favor Chris with opportunities in the family business world and Tom quickly follows suit with a new woman. But after Chris spots Nola by chance at the Tate Modern the juices start flowing all over again this time in a torrent which steers the story straight on a collision course toward tragedy. On a scene-by-scene basis pics midsection slows a bit as Chloe obsesses over her inability to get pregnant while her husband busy shagging Nola nonstop becomes tortured by his increasingly untenable position between the two women. Heavy pressure from Nola eventually forces his hand resulting in a morally ghastly climax redeemed by a genuinely inspired dramatic twist that beautifully and bitterly dovetails with the philosophical notion posited at the outset. One immediate advantage of the films English setting is that it effectively prevents the young male lead from doing a Woody Allen imitation as has so often happened in the past. Beyond that there is an evident refreshment and restimulation thats resulted from Allens immersion in a new milieu a rarefied one not often depicted by English filmmakers these days. An assortment of mostly upscale locations provides a sumptuous backdrop that takes on added mood from the consistently gray skies exemplary lensing by Remi Adefarasin and the overlay of excerpts from Verdi Rossini Donizetti et al. Cast is terrific. Rhys-Meyers who has been flitting about the margins of real recognition for the past few seasons comes further into his own with an excellent performance in the central role one which requires him to be both genuinely ingratiating and entirely repugnant. More of a blond bombshell than ever Johansson combines strong elements of sexuality self-doubt and emotional insistence in an indelible portrait of tragic beauty. Mortimer aptly pinpoints Chloes over-availability as the initial source of her husbands growing disinterest while Goode nicely rounds out the young quartet as a smooth chap whose great looks wit and intelligence seem virtual birthrights. Its amusing to see Cox so often associated with threatening or dicey characters so smoothly essaying a generous man of means.
