Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (THE SOUND OF THUNDER Murray Close) F A Sound of Thunder Genre Mystery and Thriller Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Ed Burns Ben Kingsley Catherine McCormack Jemima Rooper August Zirner; Director Peter Hyams; Author Thomas Dean Donnelly; Release Date Wide 09/02/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 103; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted September 7 2005 -- 1200 AM EDT The evolution of a turkey is a wonderful thing to behold. A Sound of Thunder for instance is so perfect in its awfulness it makes one seriously consider a theory of unintelligent design. The designers (in this case Battlefield Earth producer Elie Samaha and Timecop director Peter Hyams) first selected one of the most oft-copied science-fiction stories ever written. (In the Ray Bradbury original a time-traveling hunter inadvertently pollutes the timeline and wreaks havoc on the present.) By now of course Hollywood has pillaged and repillaged these ideas so this low-budget effort comes off looking like Timecop 3 Jurassic Stargate. Next the makers shaped a ridiculous cast. Edward Burns (as a ""big-time scientist"") brings a nice plywood smugness but the real accolades go to Ben Kingsley in full ham-and-cheese mode as a badly toupeed industrialist. But he must compete for sheer silliness with the films treatment of evolution For Sound natural selection begins and ends with giant monkey-lizards. Random chance create a movie this beautifully stupid? Ha Dont try to make a monkey-lizard out of me.

Directed by Peter Hyams from a screenplay by Thomas Dean Donnelly Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier based on the story by Ray Bradbury. 102 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence partial nudity and language. Several theaters. Time-travel movies have been around well forever. Based on the 1952 Ray Bradbury short story the latest entry ""A Sound of Thunder"" is an exciting uneven thriller that explores the ripple effect of altering one tiny moment in the distant past. Time Safari an exclusive outfit in 2055 whisks travelers back 65 million years to hunt dinosaurs just before the beasts were slated to die anyway. Tour guides warn visitors to change nothing take nothing and leave nothing behind. Given strict instructions to stay on the shimmering path above the forest floor a frightened client breaks the rules precipitating future chaos. Similarly ""A Sound of Thunder"" stays plausible as long as it sticks to Bradburys blueprint. When the tale veers off in its own direction things get sloppy. The result is a film divided into roughly two parts. Director Peter Hyams (""2010"" ""Time Cop"") first creates a scientifically grounded world thats driven by the human urge to control our environment. Great effort goes into the details -- from the nitrogen guns to the magenta spheres that store video recordings of the excursions. In the second half things get a little ridiculous sometimes laughably so. A dragon-headed serpent springs at our protagonists in the now-flooded Chicago subway system while packs of ""highly evolved"" dinosaurs stalk them from above. Edward Burns gives an adequate performance as the unflappable Travis Ryer an Indiana Jones-like scientist who leads the missions. Ben Kingsleys two-dimensional mogul Time Safari owner Charles Hatton brings a little levity to the film with his tongue-in-cheek wisecracks. Catherine McCormack plays Sonia Rand a brilliant physicist who cautions early on of the possible instability the ""safaris"" could cause. Its McCormacks forceful performance that gives the film a sense of urgency. She manages to make the emotions seem real even amid the largely unconvincing killer pseudo-dinosaurs.

Thunder shrugs off lackluster special effects in an imaginative science-fiction thrill ride 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Sound of Thunder Science fiction. Starring Edward Burns Catherine McCormack andBen Kingsley. Directed by Peter Hyams. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) People go back in time screw something up and have to go back in time again to fix things This is a recurring premise in science fiction done to death in movies starring everyone from William Shatner to Ashton Kutcher  and yet its amazing how fresh an old formula can seem when its invested with imagination. ""Sound of Thunder"" is genuine science fiction -- not just an action movie with a futuristic premise -- that takes a tiny event and traces the consequences as they snowball into utter disaster. If movies have personalities this one has an appealing one combining scientific inquisitiveness with giddy pleasure in creating tension for viewers. That quality -- a kind of mentally vibrant impishness -- can be traced at least in part to author Ray Bradbury though his 1952 short story has been altered considerably in the films retelling. The script has time to be witty and doesnt seem rushed though director Peter Hyams never stops hurtling the movie forward in ways that are usually fantastic believable and genuinely exciting. No ""Sound of Thunder"" doesnt transcend its genre. It doesnt morph into something profound. But within the limits of his ambition it gets almost everything right. The one exception minor in the grand scheme and yet impossible to ignore is that the special effects look jarringly artificial. The designers have come up with a compelling look for this future world -- Chicago 2055 -- with buildings that look ultra-modern and very much in the Chicago style. But the technicians were apparently unable to put people onto those streets without it looking like images superimposed onto a computer screen. At one point Edward Burns who plays a scientist seems to be walking in place while the backgrounds move behind him. Indeed it all looks so fake that one could assume it was an intentional statement but it cant be. So its not a movie about effects but about a couple of ideas and a bunch of thrills. Science has invented a means of going back in time and a sleazy businessman (Ben Kingsley) has already come up with a way to exploit it. Dr. Ryer (Burns) who works for him gets paid to lead hunting tours for rich people who want to go back in time 65 million years to hunt dinosaurs. The procedure is always the same Ryer his colleagues and his clients in their time-travel jumpsuits open up a little tunnel into the past and stand there. A Tyrannosaurus stumbles up and the travel party blasts it with nitrogen bullets. Afterward the clients look ecstatic while Dr. Ryer looks vaguely disgusted with himself. The movies message is not anti-hunting per se. We find out later that the Tyrannosaurus was about five minutes away from getting buried in molten lava from a nearby volcano. And apparently every time Dr. Ryer and his colleagues go back in time they kill the same dinosaur. The scientists unease rather has to do with two things His knowledge that hes engaged in something frivolous and distasteful and his intuition that (to paraphrase Nancy Sinatra) hes messing where he shouldnt be messing. The great innovation of the ""The Sound of Thunder"" one that originates with Bradbury is that when something has changed in the past the present isnt automatically transformed. Rather the changes come in waves of escalating intensity ""time waves"" which start small (changes to the climate) and build up from plant life all the way up to complicated organisms. Whats brilliant about this is that the horrors roll out slowly with increasing drama and the film becomes a race against the clock. Catherine McCormack who burst into prominence as Mel Gibsons angelic (and soon-to-be-dead) wife in ""Braveheart"" finds a nice change of pace playing a crusty angry English scientist who knew all along that something like this would happen. Normally this would be a role for Tilda Swinton but McCormack plays it well businesslike caustic and intellectual without a hint of sweetness. And as always Burns makes for an affable and convincing leading man. Once the premise is in place ""The Sound of Thunder"" becomes a series of adventures and ever-multiplying horrors as the world becomes more physically hostile and wild creepy-looking creatures appear everywhere. But the human element isnt lost. If it were that would have been ironic considering the subject.

"Sound of Thunder A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sound-of-thunder-a ) Sound of Thunder A (United States/Germany/Czech Republic 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli A Sound of Thunder takes a thought-provoking science fiction short story by Ray Bradbury and turns it into a noisy messy Hollywood action/adventure extravaganza. This approach isnt unique or inherently bad (it worked for example with Blade Runner and I Robot) but its success relies heavily upon execution and how the screenwriters choose to adapt the source material. The effectiveness of A Sound of Thunder is spotty. It begins and ends strongly but the narrative gives way to video game plotting in the middle. This protracted segment serves no purpose beyond giving the characters something to do for 30 minutes so that the movie doesnt clock in at an unacceptably short 70 minutes. The year is 2055 and the place is Chicago. Time travel has become the new frontier and the pioneers are Time Safaris led by silver-tongued entrepreneur Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley). For the big game hunter with the big wallet Hatton runs a trip back to prehistoric Illinois in which the client gets to bring down an Allosaurus. The time-tripping team includes paleontologist Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) who relishes the opportunity of studying dinosaurs first-hand. But the original time machine designer Dr. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) believes that Time Safaris should be shut down because the potential for accidentally altering evolution is too great. Indeed despite the safety checks put in place something goes wrong on a time excursion and Armageddon strikes. Then its up to Travis Sonia and their companions to fix the past to avoid losing the future to a series of ""time ripples"" that are re-shaping the present. The premise and underlying ideas are fascinating but one would expect no less from a movie that uses Ray Bradbury as its jumping-off point. Where the film goes wrong is in forcing the characters to travel from point A to point B to point C picking up ""quest items"" along the way. So there are scenes of them running around a devastated futuristic Chicago being chased by baboon/dinosaur crosses and giant mutated bats. Theres not a lot of suspense to be found in this portion of the film. Interactivity is needed to generate excitement from by-the-book chases. Im sure the video game will be fun. Speaking of video games thats what the computer generated graphics reminded me of. Too much of this film was designed using a keyboard and a mouse. Thats only a bad thing when its obvious which is the case here. We are overexposed and a lot of things appear ""unreal."" The Allosaurus for example looks more like something from a B-movie than Jurassic Park. Its like that with many of the effects in A Sound of Thunder - and this movie is effects-rich. Some are effective like the aerial shots of 2055 Chicago but all it takes is a few bad CGI moments to ruin things and A Sound of Thunder has more than a few. Theres more to suspension of disbelief than accepting special effects. The question of casting can come into play as it does here. Edward Burns is a limited actor whose range does not extend to playing a paleontologist or filling the action hero role. Granted this isnt as bad a choice as say having Mrs. Charlie Sheen play a nuclear physicist but its close. Catherine McCormack is accomplished enough that we can accept her as a scientist and Ben Kingsley can credibly portray any character including a slimy fast-talking businessman but accepting Burns as Travis is a stumbling block. Like The Island A Sound of Thunder takes an interesting science fiction concept and relegates it to the secondary role of servicing a limp action/adventure movie. Director Peter Hyams is no stranger to the genre - he has done some workmanlike efforts (2010 Outland) and some duds (Timecop The Relic) and this is somewhere in between. Hyams never succeeds in imbuing A Sound of Thunder with the juice necessary to keep an audience involved. Despite a lot of running around theres not much in the way of energy. The ending seems predestined and the overlong tepid journey getting to that point isnt worth the price of admission.

FACT BOX""A Sound of Thunder"" Starring Ben Kingsley Edward Burns Catherine McCormack Directed by Peter Hyams Written by Thomas Dean Donnelly Joshua Oppenheimer Gregory Poirier Based on ""A Sound of Thunder"" by Ray Bradbury YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Ben Kingsley Ray Bradbury Movies or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- That sound you hear while watching ""A Sound of Thunder"" is actually audience members thundering toward the exits in an effort to get away from this ghastly film.People at the studio screening I attended began fleeing after 10 minutes -- and they got in for free. Indeed while the credits rolled I heard a guy shout out ""I want my money back.""Based on a story by renowned sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury ""A Sound of Thunder"" has sat on a shelf at Warner Bros. (like CNN a unit of Time Warner) gathering dust for two years -- and it should have stayed there. In fact Bradbury should be given James Bonds license to kill and mow down the three screenwriters -- Thomas Dean Donnelly Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier -- who wrote this piece of junk.The movies basic premise isnt bad but the dumb script combined with Peter Hyams inept heavy-handed direction has mangled the original story beyond recognition.The year is 2055 and man has learned how to time travel. A greedy businessman Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley sporting a white wig that looks like a lump of cotton candy perched on his head) is the owner of Time Safari. He offers rich people a chance to travel back in time and go on prehistoric safaris to kill dinosaurs.Giving his usual deadpan performance is Edward Burns playing Dr. Travis Ryer a scientist who leads the hunts. Catherine McCormack plays Dr. Sonia Rand your run-of-the-mill brilliant physicist who created the technology for time travel. But her project was stolen by Mr. Cotton-Candy Head -- I mean Hatton -- and shes on a crusade to make him end the tours.Time Safari has one unbreakable rule -- dont bring anything back. The slightest disturbance of the past could have catastrophic results in the present. Basically its the Butterfly Effect the theory that maintains that a butterflys wings flapping on one side of the earth could eventually cause a tidal wave thousands of miles away.So naturally while on one of these safaris a customer steps on a butterfly and changes the future. Thats what happens in the story too; indeed some credit Bradbury for providing the basis of the term ""Butterfly Effect."" But still ... its so obvious now. Go get a hammer and hit me on the head.Terrible from the word goSuddenly Chicago -- where the film is supposedly set -- starts sporting prehistoric vegetation and dinosaurs rule the streets. Then a series of time waves wash over the city and -- oh never mind. Who cares?If the plots execution isnt foolish enough ""A Sound of Thunder"" also wins the award for the worst green-screen special effects ever put on film. Watching the actors walk on treadmills with fake scenes of a futuristic Chicago behind them is almost painful. The dinosaurs look like something youd see on an amusement park ride called Dino World and the overall look of the film resembles a cheap video game you could find at your local mall back in 1984.Midway through this train wreck of a film one of the characters returns to the Time Safari offices (which are now covered in a prehistoric jungle) and says ""This cant be good."" The entire audience -- what was left of it -- broke out in laughter.If youre not laughing watching ""A Sound of Thunder"" could possibly lower your IQ into the single digits. Its the worst movie of the year -- this year 2055 or even one that featured living dinosaurs.Historically Labor Day is not a big movie weekend so studios dump their most embarrassing flops into theaters during the first week of September. Heres hoping they have a special toxic dump for ""A Sound of Thunder.""

Edward Burns plays a scientist who works for a dinosaur-expedition tour company in A Sound of Thunder. Warner Bros. With its story set 50 years hence of travel back to prehistoric times A Sound of Thunder feels like a pale imitation of a Michael Crichton novel. It is however based on a 1952 short story by science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury. The cliche-laden dialogue schlocky special effects and predictable plot are derivative; the movie is overwrought and lacks suspense. The cast of creatures includes giant pointy-toothed fish; vampire bats with pterodactyl wings; and rampaging dinosaurs that evolve into primates. Humans are far less impressive. Edward Burns woodenly plays a scientist who works for Time Safari which offers expeditions to the spoiled rich taking them back 65 million years to kill dinosaurs. About the movie A Sound of Thunder  1/2 (out of four) Stars Edward Burns Ben Kingsley Catherine McCormack Director Peter Hyams Distributor Warner Bros. Running time 1 hour 41 minutes Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence partial nudity and language Opens nationwide Friday The pampered travelers must stay on a marked path and not take anything back with them to life in 2055. To underscore these rules we hear repeated admonitions such as ""If you mess with this you mess with the whole of evolution."" The moneyed customers have their own arrogant rationales ""Whats the point of being rich if you dont buy things other people cant afford?"" As obnoxious as these pseudo-adventurers are they are topped by the companys CEO played by a silver-haired Ben Kingsley. Its hard to imagine who convinced the distinguished actor to sign on to this mess of a movie. He lures in the wealthy with his oft-repeated phrase ""We promise you the experience of a lifetime and we deliver."" Too bad the movie cant make the same claim. Of course reckless rich people dont heed the rules and someone does mess with nature. This causes ""time waves"" to roll through Chicago like tsunamis of the skies hurtling buildings and cars about and turning residents into refugees. One cant help but think about the real and more devastating and moving disaster Hurricane Katrina. With this tragedy in mind one wonders why Hollywood is so determined to churn out outlandish tales of manufactured peril when the real world is scary enough.

Its a clunky and cheesy disaster that doubtless will fast-forward to bargain bins at homevid outlets. Every bit as bad as advance buzz has indicated Peter Hyams long-delayed ""A Sound of Thunder"" finally arrives in megaplexes just in time to provide an appropriately downbeat end to a disappointing summer season. Its a clunky and cheesy disaster that doubtless will fast-forward to bargain bins at homevid outlets. Loosely based on a story by Ray Bradbury -- very very loosely no doubt - pic is cautionary yarn about the dangers of time travel. In 2055 Chicago Time Safari Inc. uses cutting-edge technology to zap wealthy customers back to the Cretaceous Era for the chance to hunt dinosaurs. Everything is supposed to be rigidly controlled - just like at ""Westworld"" right? -- to ensure nothing that occurs during a blast to the past can alter the flow of history and evolution. But of course something terrible happens - specifically someone inadvertently stomps on a butterfly -- and that in turn triggers a series of ""time waves"" that threaten to revert the 21st-century planet to a prehistoric state. As primordial plant life overruns the Windy City and bizarrely evolved predators (one part primate one part reptile all parts nasty) prey on bit players and co-stars Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) the studly scientist who leads the Time Safari treks and Dr. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) inventor of the time-travel technology struggle to reverse the reverting process. Its conceivable that ""Thunder"" might have been more impressive with an upgrade in its production values. (The chintzy special effects often make it appear the actors have been dropped into the middle of a video game.) But all the high-tech gloss in the world wouldnt smooth Hyams bumpy pacing - by turns desperately frenetic and yawningly plodding - or untangle the sometimes torturously muddled storyline. There are definite signs of last-minute cutting re-cutting and re-re-cutting. And there is every indication that most of the cast didnt feel ""Thunder"" was worth the expenditure of excessive effort. Ben Kingsley has a few choice moments as Time Safari CEO Charles Hatton a glad-handing greedhead who undermines safety precautions. Unfortunately hes forced to wear an outrageous wig that makes it appear he has a massive White Persian cat perched atop his head. Theres probably an interesting doc (or docudrama) to be made about the making of ""A Sound of Thunder."" Pic was buffeted by mishaps like massive flooding during location filming in the Czech Republic and the subsequent (albeit not directly related) bankruptcy of Franchise Pictures. Surely this drama behind the drama would be far more entertaining than what actually appears on screen.
