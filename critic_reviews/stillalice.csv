Photo Credit AP / Sony Pictures Classics advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A linguistics professor develops early-onset Alzheimers. BOTTOM LINE A modest drama but Moores heart-wrenching and Oscar-nominated performance makes this a must-see. CAST Julianne Moore Kristen Stewart Alec Baldwin LENGTH 139 Two actors seem likely to win Academy Awards next month for playing characters struggling with debilitating diseases. One is Eddie Redmayne as the real-life scientist Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"" and the other is Julianne Moore as a professor with early-onset Alzheimers in ""Still Alice."" Theyre the kinds of roles that actors love requiring a range of heightened emotions in the face of life-threatening circumstances. Redmayne and Moore however are doing something different. Their characters arent just facing a loss of life but a loss of self. Hawkings motor neuron disease steadily diminishes his ability to communicate via speech or even gestures; by the films end Redmaynes acting is reduced almost entirely to his eyes. Likewise Dr. Alice Howland Moores fictional character in ""Still Alice"" is losing her memory -- not just of her professional skills but of the people she loves and the very experiences that make her who she is. advertisement | advertise on newsday Its hard to say which performance is better but Moores is the more heart-wrenching. In ""Still Alice"" based on Lisa Genovas 2007 novel Moore presents us with a vibrant 50-year-old woman at the top of her personal and professional game. Shes a star in the linguistics department at Columbia University. Her marriage to John (Alec Baldwin) is solid. Her grown children -- Kate Bosworth as snooty Anna Hunter Parrish as levelheaded Tom and Kristen Stewart as the budding actress Lydia -- seem more or less equipped for life.

Small hiccups in Alices memory -- a word forgotten a question repeated -- are followed by major blank-outs like a casual jog that turns into a nightmare of disorientation. ""I think I have a brain tumor"" Alice muses but a doctors appointment reveals the real problem. Whats more Alices children may develop early-onset Alzheimers as well. A simple medical test can tell them but is such dreadful knowledge even worth having? Each will have to decide. Written and directed by spouses Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland ""Still Alice"" can feel a bit like a cable-television movie hitting predetermined and familiar beats but it also wisely chooses to find happiness in its story rather than wallow in tears. Ultimately its Moores sensitive and dignified performance that makes the movie a must-see.

"Still Alice (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Still Alice (PG-13) Julianne Moore stars as a linguistics professor diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com1/29/2015 Editor rating 3 Still Alice opens with a celebration Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) a respected linguistics professor at Columbia University is ringing in her 50th birthday at a posh restaurant in the company of her surgeon husband (Alec Baldwin) and two of their grown children Anna (Kate Bosworth) who is married and studying law and Tom (Hunter Parrish) who is making his way through med school. The only one missing is her youngest daughter Lydia (Kristen Stewart) who chucked the family tradition and skipped college to move to Los Angeles and become an actress. Alice is blessed with a loving family a caring husband a thriving career and no need to ever worry about money. But then cracks start to form around her near-perfect life First she forgets a word during a lecture at UCLA about the way we communicate (she remembers it later on the car ride back to her hotel). After visiting Lydia and imploring her to go to college as a safety net she returns home to New York goes for a jog and gets lost. Worried that she may have a brain tumor she goes to see a neurologist who runs a battery of tests. The good news is that there is no tumor. The bad news is devastating She has tested positive for early onset Alzheimers. If it turns out to be a genetic disorder there is a 50-50 chance her children will inherit it too. Based on the novel by Lisa Genova Still Alice which was written and directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland (Quinceanera) sounds like a disease-movie-of-the-week and in many ways it is charting the gradual deterioration of someone afflicted with an incurable illness. The ending is predetermined. What counts is how the film gets there and with Moores formidable Oscar-bound performance the picture transcends the usual cliches of the genre to become something far more moving and profound. Moore who radiates a deep intelligence and humanity even when shes playing shallow characters -- think of her as the cokehead porn star in Boogie Nights -- pulls off an astonishing feat showing us the light and life in her eyes gradually dimming as the disease takes hold. The movie is harrowing as any story about Alzheimers should be but Moore gives it an extra layer of gravity and heartbreaking inevitability. You become a member of her onscreen family hoping against hope for a miracle that you know will never come. The film which deftly avoids cheap tears or melodramatic situations sneaks up on you the way the illness sneaks up on Alice. Once she is diagnosed her first reaction is terror. Here is a woman of great intellect who has made a career out of language and watching her stumbling over a simple phrase after shes forgotten a word or writing reminders to herself on her cellphone about mundane things takes on the undertones of a cruel hateful joke. When she tells her husband ""I wish I had cancer. I wouldnt feel so ashamed"" Moore makes you understand the frustration and anger Alice feels at her inability to do anything about her condition other than learn to live with it. Alzheimers isnt just a horrible disease for the afflicted It is also grueling on their families who must continue to lead their lives while caring for a person who is increasingly distant and difficult. When she gets home from a run and her husband asks her where shes been because they had made important dinner plans with another couple Alice snaps ""Im sorry I forgot. I have Alzheimers."" But theres a strong suggestion that she did it on purpose preferring to hide behind her condition rather than risk looking like a fool in front of her friends. As her disease progresses at an alarming speed the movie puts you through the wringer such as a scene in which she cant find the bathroom in her home and soils herself or another scene in which shes talking to her daughter without recognizing her. The supporting performances are strong especially Baldwin as Alices unwavering rock of a husband and Stewart as her rebellious daughter who knows her mother considers her the black sheep of the family. Despite its simple premise Still Alice is an emotionally complex work exploring the different ways in which each of Alices loved ones deals with her condition. But the movie wouldnt work at all without Moore who captures the cruel tragedy of the disease without ever begging for the audiences pity. The movie is hampered only by its overly pat ending which solves several dilemmas with a convenient deus ex machina. But what you remember most is Moore as Alice a woman fading into a ghost of herself in front of your eyes her panic gradually giving way to blissful heartbreaking obliviousness. As we age memories become our most prized possessions. Still Alice illuminates the grand tragedy and loneliness of people whose bodies remain healthy but whose minds -- and memories -- abandon them.

The time when movies -- already opened in New York and Los Angeles -- are opening closer to home shored up by the attention the nominations (or even the whiff of a nomination) can stir. ""Still Alice"" and ""Cake"" are two indie dramas that should benefit from this annual rite. Although owing to deep tissue performances by Oscar front-runner Julianne Moore and Golden Globe nominee and old friend Jennifer Aniston they deserve our interest regardless of the award-season dance. ""Still Alice"" |    1/2 Stars | Drama | PG-13 | 99 minutes | At the Chez Artiste. In ""Still Alice"" Moore plays Alice Howland a Columbia University linguistics professor who at 50 is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers disease. This is no spoiler. Knowing from the get-go the devastation Alice and her family face adds to the films power. Blips of Alices confusion become harbingers of encroaching disaster. The use of tracking shots that follow Alice as she becomes disoriented during a familiar run give the film the subtlest horror-film flavor. As if to ask rightly what could be scarier than the aggressive erosion of the identity each of us builds with our memories? ""Still Alice"" is directed with delicate appreciation for the more quotidian rhythms of life by indie stalwarts Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland. Moores depiction of Alices journey is so riveting that it makes it easy to overlook how full of grace the movie-making is or how vitally the supporting cast buttresses the protagonist. Alec Baldwin plays steadfast husband John. Kate Bosworth Kristen Stewart and Hunter Parrish portray their very different but present children. In addition to bearing the weight of her diagnosis Alice learns her rare form of Alzheimers is very likely to be passed to her children. So each must decide if they want to know their fate. In a telling twist its the child who doesnt want to know her genetic status who wants to know the most about how Alice is feeling. Yes sorrow-laden and moving ""Still Alice"" isnt gratuitously grim nor is it easily sentimental. Theres humor here -- vaguely gallows-like perhaps but also earned. Early on the pragmatic professor leaves herself a video with guidance about what she should do once shes been robbed of too much cognition. As smart as she has been Alice cannot anticipate how cruelly clever her enemy will be. Alices neurologist Dr. Benjamin (Stephen Kunken) is at first only a voice bearing bad then worse tidings. We hear his methodical queries but see only Alices face during their initial consult. Over time he enters the frame gently significant but never intruding on film which is based on a novel by Lisa Genova a best-selling author and neurologist. Like Genova the films directors know something about medical foes. At the time the couple undertook the project Glatzer was diagnosed with ALS. For those who know the pairs Sundance-winning L.A. story ""Quinceanera"" the empathy that infuses ""Still Alice"" cant be credited solely to this diagnosis of the terminal neurological disease. Instead like Alices doc we do well to admire their utter resourcefulness in the face of unforgiving odds. Edgy Aniston ""Cake"" is a different tale of misery. When we meet Claire shes scarred physically and emotionally. Shes eating painkillers and moving as if shed been run over by a semi. For a parent whos lost a child that analogy is likely an understatement. ""Cake"" |    Stars | Drama | R | 102 minutes. Jennifer Aniston burrows into Claires walking-wounded gait and eclipsed mood. She also makes clear that in the midst of her dulled affect Claire can wield precision cuts. The easy targets of her ire include Annette (Felicity Huffman) the moderator of a chronic-pain group and her estranged husband (Chris Messina). Directed by Daniel Barnz from a screenplay by Patrick Tobin ""Cake"" reveals its backstory as gingerly as Claire moves from car to bed to couch to bed. She sees a physical therapist (Mamie Gummer) but doesnt appear to be taking baby steps let alone making strides toward recovery. Things change -- though its hard to know if its for the better -- when Claire becomes obsessed with Nina. Anna Kendrick makes appearances as the biting hallucination of the fellow group member who leapt from a freeway overpass. Its a telling death for a film that travels the surface streets and byways of L.A. Claire doesnt drive and keeps the passenger seat cranked back. So much of what we spy are the tops of palms glimpses of blue sky. Claires pursuit of the mystery of Ninas suicide leads her to seek out her husband (Sam Worthington) and pushes the story toward a kind of redemption fable. But Anistons grasp of Claires shut-down even destructive anguish never wavers. Another fine reason to see ""Cake"" is for Adriana Barrazas portrayal of Claires concerned housekeeper. Silvanas vigilant care of her employer might have saddled the movie with a kind of romanticized image of domestic help. Instead Barraza delivers a textured observant heroine. And the filmmakers make sure we see however briefly that she has a life beyond Claires care.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 23 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 23 2015 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland Written by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland Starring Julianne Moore Alec Baldwin Kristen Stewart Country USA Language English The movie Still Alice is about a New York professor Alice Howland played by Julianne Moore. Shortly after her 50th birthday she begins showing symptoms of early-onset Alzheimers disease and the film follows the progress of the condition from her point of view.Based on neuroscientist Lisa Genovas 2007 bestselling novel of the same name Still Alice is accurate and compassionate and anyone who has known someone with Alzheimers will appreciate the films sincere intentions. Apart from Moores measured central performance however the movie adapted by co-directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland is workmanlike. The filmmakers rely on obvious tricks of playing with overlapping and out-of-focus shots to show Alices confusion. They leave out the paranoia anger and physical deterioration. Actresses Julianne Moore and Kristen Stewart express their excitement on Moores Golden Globe win for best drama actress at the premiere of Still Alice in New York. (Jan. 14) AP Video Video Video Julianne Moore on her Golden Globe win In its depiction of family issues the script appears to be following the checked boxes on a medical chart. Theres a half-formed subplot about the sibling rivalry between Alices adult daughters Anna (Kate Bosworth) and Lydia (Kristen Stewart). (Siblings may find existing tensions are exacerbated by the illness of a parent.) The performance from Alec Baldwin as Alices medical-researcher husband John is so weirdly unctuous and menacing you might suspect hes slipping drugs into her favourite Pinkberry Yogurt. (A spouse struggling to deal with the changes in a loved one may become withdrawn and distant.)Among the more heavy-handed ironies Alice is a brilliant linguistics professor (""Ive always been defined by my intellect""). Her life is a testament to the benefits of being smart She and her husband live in an elegant Manhattan apartment and have a summer house on Long Island. Their eldest daughter Anna is a lawyer preparing to produce their first grandchild. Their middle child Tom (Hunter Parrish) is about to finish medical school.The only hair in this perfect bowl of cream is the youngest daughter Lydia (Stewart) who skipped college to go to Los Angeles to try to make it as an actress. After Alice heads out to California to deliver a lecture - and has her first disturbing forgetful moment at the podium - she visits Lydia. They have a familiar argument about Alices wish to have Lydia go to university and give up this frivolous acting business.Why is the character an actress? In the novel Alice in her decline sometimes imagined she was in one of Lydias plays living an alternate reality like her namesake the Lewis Carroll heroine who disappeared through the looking-glass. The subplot about theatre also allows Lydia to offer her mother the solace of art quoting poetic passages about loss from Anton Chekhovs The Three Sisters and especially Tony Kushners Angels in America.For the movies purposes we have the added irony of seeing Julianne Moore of all people belittling the power of acting. At its best Still Alice is about acting about trying to present a good front and how a great actress can communicate what is otherwise unreachable. Moores gift is her transparent emotional presence Even when Alice is trying to cover up shes wonderfully readable. During many scenes in the film the camera simply focuses on her pale freckled face registering her fear and struggle for control Getting the diagnosis from a doctor telling her children the bad news talking to her supervisor at work. At other times Moore simply interacts with her smartphone on which she has left herself prerecorded questions to monitor her condition for as long as shes capable.Still Alice is being called a career performance for Moore and although it may be one of her most poignant roles (it has earned her a fifth Oscar nomination) the part barely scratches the surface of her ability. If youve seen Neil Jordans 2000 short film of Samuel Becketts play Not I which features nothing but Moores mouth on screen as she rails against her trauma youll see how tentatively Still Alice edges toward that same abyss.

"Still Alices Julianne Moore is exceptional as woman with Alzheimers review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies Still Alices Julianne Moore is exceptional as woman with Alzheimers review Julianne Moores stunning performance in Still Alice envelopes us in a brilliant professors decline after being diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers disease. By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Jan. 22 2015Still AliceStarring Julianne Moore Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart. Directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland. 101 minutes. Opening Friday Jan. 23 at the Varsity and the Queensway. PGAn early scene in Still Alice prompts a shiver of dread terrifying for the inevitability it heralds.University professor Alice Howland exceptionally played by Julianne Moore deserving every accolade has gone for a run on the New York campus where she teaches. Suddenly she has no idea where she is.Article Continued BelowShe stops panting and confused looking for some visual clue while the camera circles her.Julianne Moore plays Alice who is struck with early-onset Alzheimers disease. She is nominated for an Oscar for the role.The glib 50-year-old Columbia linguistics expert will soon be diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers disease. But at this moment her face can only register a bit of annoyance then fear and doubt and finally relief and a hint of embarrassment as she gets her bearings. Tragically it is just the beginning.Moores stunning performance already a Golden Globe winner and a near-certainty for long-overdue Oscar gold Feb. 22 envelopes us in every aspect of Alices struggle from the games she plays to test her recall after the first evidence of a deteriorating memory to emotionally shattering moments of panic and shame.Based on Lisa Genovas bestseller directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland -- who also wrote the screenplay -- have sanded the roughest edges from a devastating decline. The film leans toward the soft and is occasionally sentimental which makes it easier to watch but less effective than it could have been.Yet there is much to take away after the lights come up even if Still Alice shies away from taking risks. Dont be surprised to find yourself suddenly obsessed with forgotten names and misplaced keys.Alice is married to biologist-researcher husband John played with careful restraint by Alec Baldwin as a man who cant square his scientific knowledge with his at-home heartbreak.A mother of three her diagnosis of inherited Alzheimers traps her adult children (Kate Bosworth Hunter Parrish and Kristen Stewart) in a spiral of constantly watching their mother for hints of her disease and worrying that they may face the same fate.""I wish I had cancer"" Alice whispers to John as her struggles worsen. ""I wouldnt feel so ashamed.""As the Alzheimers progresses and Alice considers in various heartbreaking ways what the outcome will mean and what she can do about it we witness the rapid erosion of a brilliant mind. Yet Glatzer and Westmoreland (The Last of Robin Hood Quinceanera) find ways to inject some hope and even occasional humour.Mirrors and out-of-focus shots echo the rigorous self-checking Alice obsessively turns to her tests fading into lost days as her memory ebbs.Glazer has his own experience with the nature of degenerative conditions; he suffers from ALS which has robbed him of speech. He communicates using an iPad with a text-to-voice program.As Alices life is stripped down to essentials she finds her strongest support in an unlikely place with youngest daughter Lydia (Stewart). Lydia is a struggling theatre actress living in L.A. who hasnt seen eye-to-eye with her mother in the past about lifestyle and education.Stewart is very good as the only family member who accepts Alices illness without wishful thinking or coddling. ""Whats it like?"" she asks her mother. ""What does it actually feel like?""Ill be Me For a more immediate less-neatly examined portrait of Alzheimers look to James Keachs doc Glen Campbell Ill Be Me as-yet unreleased here. It follows the country legend now in a 24-hour care facility in the final stages of Alzheimers as he makes his final concert tour in 2011-12 while obviously firmly in the grip of the disease.Its honest raw and heartbreaking showing the unblinking reality of the decline.Campbells presence will also be felt at the Oscars even though he is not able to attend ""Im Not Gonna Miss You"" which he co-wrote with Julian Raymond and begins with the haunting line ""Im still here but yet Im gone"" has been nominated for Best Original Song.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 401pm on Thursday Jan. 22 2015 Thursday Jan. 22 2015 Thursday Jan. 22 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Julianne Moore walked away with the Golden Globe for best actress in a drama -- beating out the likes of Rosamund Pike in Gone Girl Felicity Jones in The Theory of Everything and Reese Witherspoon in Wild -- for a film that has received far less exposure than those of her awards-ready counterparts. Shes likely to do it again on Oscar night and if she does there shouldnt be too many complaints even from her opponents. In Still Alice about a woman tumbling deeper into the fog of early onset Alzheimers disease Moore is at the top of her game.She plays Alice Howland a successful linguistics professor at Columbia University who also just happens to have a picture-perfect family including an ambitious medical doctor for a husband (Alec Baldwin) and three adult children at various life stages. Tom (Hunter Parrish) is a med student following in Dads footsteps. Anna (Kate Bosworth) is a married lawyer whos trying to start a family of her own. Lydia (Kristen Stewart) is in Los Angeles struggling to be an actress.But theres a shadow on Alices horizon one more serious than the usual angst that comes when celebrating the significant birthday -- her 50th -- that opens the film. She is starting to forget little things and lose her facility with words. Thats a tragedy for anyone but especially for someone whose very identity is inextricably tied to language and memory.As Alice falls deeper down the rabbit hole she gradually loses contact with her friends family and finally herself.Such a journey could have made for a mawkish movie experience. Instead as directed and written by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland (based on a novel by Lisa Genova) Still Alice is mostly subtle and heartbreaking. Even Baldwin reins in his more over-the-top tendencies. The filmmakers who are life as well as business partners have said in interviews that they gleaned a very personal insight into dealing with a life-changing debilitating illness after Glatzer was diagnosed with ALS in 2011.Yet as strong as the duos script and direction are its Moore who really brings the film and the reality it represents home. Its in her expression when the doctor gives his diagnosis and pessimistic prognosis. Its in the way she looks at her family knowing there will come a time when she wont recognize them.Ultimately its in her strength as she decides to deal with her cruel fate in her own way. Still Alice doesnt deal as well with how the disease affects those around Alice. According to the film early onset Alzheimers often has a genetic component so Alices decline could be her childrens future. Yet with the exception of Lydia for whom the disease brings her closer to her mother the members of the family are not fully fleshed out.This makes it all the more important that the character of Alice anchor the film in an engrossing reality. Moore is that anchor making sure this cinematic ship doesnt sink under the weight of what could have been a heavy-handed sob story.

January 22 2015 -- 249pm Sony Pictures Classics Julianne Moore is a college professor in the grips of early-onset Alzheimers in ""Still Alice."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert ""Still Alice"" is an incredibly sad coming-of-age story. Most mainstream entries feature an adolescent making the mental leap from child to adult. This story follows the life of its protagonist from middle age to mental childhood. If it didnt star Julianne Moore it would be well worth skipping. But the exceptional way Moore plays Alice a renowned Columbia University linguistics professor with early-onset Alzheimers lifts the film above its morose potential. You dont need to have a personal connection with the disease for the film to abscond with your heart. Just watch Moores work. It is not a perfect film. Its narrowly focused like a cable movie about the plight of a decent upstanding upper-class woman the kind of slim blues riff Lifetime runs three a week. Directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland made earlier films where they couldnt grasp the material firmly a bland Kevin Kline yarn about the late movie star Lothario Errol Flynn (""The Last of Robin Hood"") and the cheesy gay porn satire ""The Fluffer."" Adapting this film from neuroscientist Lisa Genovas bestselling novel they are authentic. You admire their push for playing the facts of a critical illness straight and carefully making sure that every point is accurate and that every expressive close-up is held as long as possible. Alice is 50 married to a doctor (Alec Baldwin) with his own important academic professorship. The brilliant couple live in a beautiful Upper West Side townhouse and love meeting with their three grown children Anna who is pregnant with twins (Kate Bosworth); Tom a young doctor (Hunter Parrish) and Lydia (Kristen Stewart) the rebel of the pack who is trying to pursue an acting career. The texture of the early domestic scenes is nice like Alices interactions with her students. Her specialty is research into the way small children learn semantics and when her grasp of language begins to slip away she takes tests privately then tells all four of her tribe whats coming. From Baldwin on down they are stunned. The movie isnt about marriage. Its entirely believable focus is how the whole family responds to the fragmenting disintegrating illness that has invaded Alice. We see the squabbling it creates the feelings that overlap or collide and the laughs when Alice is soothing and adjusting on a good day trying to keep tension to a minimum. The reason the film flies is the directors long touching shots of Moore. One truly saddening sequence has her trying to prime herself to deliver a lecture only to discover that her major asset isnt on its best behavior that day. STILL ALICE 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for mature thematic material brief language and a sexual reference. Theater Uptown. As Alzheimers snips her cranial nerves the insoluble mystery of her sickness grows while her attention shrinks. She remains a good and tender woman as the world becomes populated by strangers. When Anna delivers her twins her mothers wish to embrace them in the hospital worries the family. Could she do that safely? ""I know how to hold a baby"" she says simultaneously hurt and proud. The title is a key to the films meaning. Is ""Still Alice"" a way of saying that for all her struggles Alice is still committed to staying among us? Or does it imply the stillness that arrives at the end of life? As her perceptions shrink Alice withdraws deeper into youth. Moore plays her at a dozen different age spans over the course of the film. In a stunning sequence forgetful Alice discovers a video she recorded for herself a year earlier offering important secret advice. Its as if Moore is playing two utterly different women having a Skype conversation. She can carry the film through ordinary scenes -- having a tough phone conversation while on a walk chopping vegetables for dinner with a large knife angrily wondering where an important item got put away -- and make them electrically powerful. The reason Oscar conversations tend to put Moore as a best actress front-runner is not that shes ""due"" as if being in the race repeatedly before makes you a winner now. Its because she is an artist of limitless resources even when shes playing a woman whose human properties are draining away.

When she receives a devastating diagnosis Moores whole world begins to change. VPCJulianne Moore is brilliant as a linguistics professor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers disease. But the bulk of the rest of the film is predictable and cliched.Julianne Moore stars as a woman with early-onset Alzheimers disease in ""Still Alice."" She has been nominated for an Oscar for the role.(Photo Jojo Whilden/Sony Pictures Classics)Story Highlights3.5 stars (out of 5)Moores character develops early-onset Alzheimers disease.Stewart is also good worlds better than in the ""Twilight"" movies.The disease-of-the-week movie once enjoyed a proud(ish) tradition on television featuring likable characters stricken with a dread illness allowing actors the chance to suffer and sometimes die onscreen with a few commercials sandwiched in between.So maybe its fair to call ""Still Alice"" a big-screen throwback in that regard as the story -- of a brilliant linguistics professor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers disease at age 50 -- hits all the familiar notes. But imagine such a movie with a genuinely brilliant performance at its center and youve got this film based on a novel by Lisa Genova and directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland.That performance comes from Julianne Moore who received an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of the title character and deserved it. Alice teaches at Columbia University has a beautiful home a loving mostly successful family and pretty much every privilege in life available to rich people in movies.But something is amiss. Alice is starting to forget things. Words at first. Then she gets lost while jogging or cant remember a recipe. She compensates with her iPhone and it takes her overworked husband John (Alec Baldwin) a while to notice. Her grown children are too busy to pay it much attention. Daughter Anna (Kate Bosworth) and her husband Charlie (Shane McRae) are trying to have a baby while Tom (Hunter Parrish) is in medical school. Lydia (Kristen Stewart) is the nominal black sheep of the family a struggling actress across the country in LA.Interview Julianne Moore discusses Still Alice and the OscarsAlices diagnosis is rare. Even more devastating it is a variety that can be passed on (she probably got the gene from her father); her children stand a 50-50 chance of inheriting the gene and a 100 percent chance of developing Alzheimers if they do.Those odds are played out in surprisingly non-dramatic fashion given that just about everything else in the movie is designed for maximum emotional manipulation. (Thats not always a bad thing as some of the scenes are quite moving.)The story is predictably grim and emotional. Alice tries to put up a brave front at first but can stave off the inevitable for only so long. In a speech after she has been diagnosed she says she doesnt suffer she struggles. Yet she also tells John plainly that she wishes she had cancer instead.Kristen Stewart (left) stars as Lydia the youngest daughter of Julianne Moores Alice. Lydia the black sheep of the family moves home to help care for her mother. (Photo Sony Pictures Classics)The best scenes and the ones that seem the least contrived are those between Moore and Stewart the latter worlds away from her cardboard-cutout performances in the ""Twilight"" movies. The other kids are too self-involved to really become invested in their mothers decline and if that sounds selfish so be it. But Stewarts Lydia checks in by way of Skype and eventually moves back to help John take care of Alice.Alice it seems has long been disappointed in Lydias decision to pass up college to take a shot at acting. And her diagnosis does not prevent her from continuing to relate this disappointment to her youngest daughter. Her cajoling and Lydias rejecting of it play out naturally even as Lydia realizes she must begin to scale back on her arguments. Lydias recognition and acceptance of the situation and her growing devotion to her mother are a welcome break from the expected.But ultimately this is a movie built around Moores performance and she doesnt disappoint. Not by a long shot. Surely with a script like this it would be easy to overplay the role but Moore doesnt. Quiet moments -- ""I forgot I have Alzheimers"" Alice tells John after not remembering dinner plans -- are far more devastating than not being able to find the bathroom in their summer house for instance. Its Moore who makes the movie worthwhile who elevates it from disease-of-the-week fare to the role of a lifetime.Still Alice3.5 stars (out of 5)Directors Richard Glatzer Wash Westmoreland.Cast Julianne Moore Kristen Stewart Alec Baldwin.Rating PG-13 for mature thematic material and brief language including a sexual reference.Note At Harkins Camelview 5.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Her civil rights drama closes in on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (a magnificent David Oyelowo whose Best Actor snub mystifies) as he leads a march from Alabamas Selma to the state capital in 1965 to peacefully protest voting inequalities. In a bold and refreshing move the iconic reverend is portrayed as both a dignified hero who can sway a room with an eloquent speech and a philandering husband who takes out the garbage.

Still Alice3 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)Oscar nomination Best Actress (Julianne Moore) Theres a difference between a great performance and a Great Performance. Julianne Moores turn as a linguistics professor afflicted with early onset Alzheimers easily qualifies as the latter. Shes Alice who just after her 50th birthday gets alarmed when she starts blanking on familiar names and words. (""Its like my brain is falling out from under me"" she haltingly explains to her husband played by Alec Baldwin.) Though her family struggles to accept the diagnosis nobody is more distraught than Alice herself. Inch by inch her condition deteriorates and Moore is able to subtly convey all the panic and frustration with just a look on her face. This poignant film doesnt sugarcoat a thing yet its still beautifully done. Julianne Moore in Still Alice Linda Kallerus Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics PHOTOS Best Oscars beauty looks 5.

What a treat to watch stars take on these classic characters in this lush adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical. These familiar icons (and more) go into the woods to seek their fortunes and become pawns in the witchs spell. Streep as always stands out in a forest-chewing role -- though her onetime Devil Wears Prada underling Blunt (herself a Golden Globe nominee) does some beguiling work as well.

"Still Alice | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; still-alice ) Still Alice (United States 2014) January 16 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres no shortage of literature and cinema about human beings afflicted with Alzheimers or some form of dementia. The near universality of the caregivers experience one of the most painful trials any person can be asked to endure is one reason for this. Yet for all that has been written and filmed about this few stories can claim to do what Lisa Genova accomplished in her novel Still Alice tell the tale from the perspective of the diseases victim. The movie adaptation by directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland retains this aspect while supplanting the usual sentimentality of ""Alzheimers films"" with a clear-eyed honesty. Still Alice is heartbreaking but it doesnt earn its tears through easy emotional manipulation. The films highlight is the performance of Oscar-nominated (and likely winner) Julianne Moore whose turn as Dr. Alice Howland captures all the nuances of a brilliant woman slowly losing herself. Moore plays the part without histrionics; its a controlled contained portrayal that can rival Eddie Redmaynes in The Theory of Everything. The actress fully inhabits the body and personality of someone being diminished by a condition over which she has no control. The rest of the cast of Still Alice is comprised of recognizable names playing supporting roles Alec Baldwin as Alices supportive-yet-fearful husband John; Kristen Stewart as Lydia the youngest of the three Howland children and her mothers eventual caregiver; Hunter Parrish as Tom the only son; and Kate Bosworth as Anna the mother-to-be who carries Alices poison gene. When the movie begins Alice has a seemingly perfect life. A Columbia cognitive psychologist at the top of her field she has a loving husband and three children with whom she shares good relationships. The downhill progression begins slowly she stumbles over words she would normally be able to retrieve without a problem becomes disoriented while out jogging and fails to remember meeting her sons girlfriend. The diagnosis is ominous early onset Alzheimers a rare genetic version of the disease. The majority of Still Alice chronicles the main characters deterioration as the pernicious influence of the condition chips away at Alices memories intelligence and identity. Still Alice is undoubtedly a tough movie; it contains life-affirming moments but its perspective is what makes it unique. The production takes us into Alices mind and projects her changing circumstances through her eyes. It is often said that Alzheimers is more difficult on the loved ones of a victim than on the afflicted individual. Still Alice challenges that belief. Alice is well aware of whats happening to her - how her world is closing in on her. Her frustration and despair are palpable. She remembers things she could do but no longer has the capacity to achieve. The final scene is poignant. Given todays level of medical technology its inevitable but that doesnt make it any less sad. In addition to exploring the impacts of Alzheimers on the lives of Alice and her family the film also ventures into the uncertain territory of how society views the disease and its victims. While there is abundant sympathy for John and the children Alice receives little more than pitying glances and obligatory condolences. At one point she notes that shed rather have cancer - at least then people would be more understanding. The medical professions impotence is also highlighted theres nothing they can do no miracle drug that can arrest the diseases devastating track. In the end John accepts a lucrative job offer in another city because he cant bear to spend his every waking hour with what his wife is becoming. The films co-directors married couple Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland bring a unique perspective to Alices struggles. Glatzer is afflicted with ALS. Although very different in nature from Alzheimers ALS can ultimately have a similarly devastating impact on a persons sense of identity (as can be seen in the aforementioned The Theory of Everything) and Glatzer brings his personal intimate knowledge to this production. The lack of mawkishness in the directors approach saves Still Alice from being an overwhelmingly depressing experience. The movie is melancholy to be sure but its straightforward approach allows it to effectively tell the story without resorting to cheap theatrics. As for Moorea| if she wins the Oscar for this portrayal its well-deserved recognition.

Based on Lisa Genovas novel its the story of Alice Howland a wife mother and linguistics professor who falls terribly slowly and then terribly swiftly into early-onset Alzheimers disease. Surrounded by her family her career and no small amount of material comfort Alices descent is as terrifying as it is ironic; a professor of linguistics whos studied language acquisition all her life is now unable to find the right words but aware enough to track her downfall. Between the terror of the diagnosis and the irony of the circumstance Alice is a part that would demand the best of any actress not just to play it but also not to over-play it; how fortunate for us then that Julianne Moore one of our finest actresses plays the title role. Also read Julianne Moore Honored for Alzheimers Movie by Palm Springs Film Festival Theres a possibility that the basics of ""Still Alice"" make it sound maudlin or more on the frequency of a made-for-TV movie than what it is. But this is not only sensitive material handled with tact and humanity its also sensitive material bolstered and braced by Moores stunning performance. Its not just that Moore has a steady and firm hand on her work even as Alice loses more and more control; its the basic humanity of her performance that stuns you as she goes through her crises. ""I wish I had cancer"" she notes to her M.D. husband John (Alec Baldwin) early on. ""I wouldnt feel so ashamed. People put on pink ribbons if you have cancer."" For all the big scenes you would expect in a drama like this -- the first time Alice tells her husband the first time she tells her children (played by Kate Bosworth Hunter Parrish and Kristen Stewart) the meetings with her doctor as the diagnosis gets worse -- its also worth noting that every scene here is written with depth to match its force with everyday realism to match its exceptional nature. Alice isnt above planning her own suicide; shes not above using her condition as leverage to get her actress daughter to go to college by framing it as one of her last wishes. Also read A Most Violent Year Named Top Film by National Board of Review Theres an extraordinarily tough and smart delicacy to ""Still Alice"" and it stretches far beyond the writing or Moores performance or even the sympathy of the circumstance. The film superbly uses its own focus (as shot by cinematographer Denis Lenoir ""Carlos"") as a device with the world blurring and blooming into shapes and colors as Alice loses her train of thought and snapping back to crispness when -- or if -- she recovers her own mind from the ghostly hands dragging it down. The score by Ilan Eshkeri (""Kick-Ass"") is also a standout covering everything from beautiful notes in near-silence to sequences that are meant to -- and do -- evoke Alices confusion and loss. Moores work has been earning raves since ""Still Alice"" debuted at the Toronto International Film festival and with good reason Its a careful performance one that never steps too far forward into melodrama while at the same time never holding back. (A scene with Moore touring a Alzheimers facility -- ostensibly for a relative but actually for herself -- is a quiet masterpiece.) Also read Sony Classics Toronto Pickup of Still Alice Puts Julianne Moore in the Oscar Race All the other performers are excellent as well; Baldwin torn between frustration and sympathy between an extraordinary event and the need to move forward is superb with Stewart a special standout as the most wayward daughter of the family a would-be actor brought back to the fold by tragedy. Any drama can wring tears out of an audience; it takes a superb drama to deserve them. Youll want to see ""Still Alice"" to confirm that it contains one of the years best female performances by the astonishing Moore but it also -- and thankfully -- contains and embraces much much more.

This middlebrow drama presents the heroines mental deterioration calmly and sensitively though it feels pretty thin on the whole.

Linda Kallerus/Sony Pictures Classics hide caption toggle caption Linda Kallerus/Sony Pictures Classics Julianne Moore plays Alice Howland a linguistics professor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers disease. Linda Kallerus/Sony Pictures Classics A circumstance that might well qualify as a fate worse than death is to continue living after one side of the human equation -- body + mind -- has been canceled. For a jaunty account of an active brain in a withering physique see The Theory of Everything; for a more anguished view of the opposite situation theres Still Alice. The story opens with chilling chronological precision at the 50th-birthday party of Alice Howling (Julianne Moore). The milieu is upscale intellectual Manhattan nearly as perfect as the family living in it. Husband John (Alec Baldwin) is a medical researcher at Columbia University where Alice also teaches. Daughter Anna (Kate Bosworth) is married and laboring to produce the couples first grandchild; son Tom (Hunter Parrish) is nearly a doctor. Only the youngest Lydia (Kristen Stewart) has wandered off the accepted path skipping college -- and moms birthday -- to attempt an acting career in LA. We will come to have some sympathy for Lydia if only because shes a rumple however small in a overly tidy scenario. Alice cant simply be a 50-year-old who experiences disturbing lapses of memory. When she begins to forget words its while lecturing in her specialty linguistics. Many of such details come from Lisa Genovas best-selling novel which directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland have adapted with reasonable fidelity. The two men longtime artistic and life partners have a personal interest in the subject of bodies and brains that age at different speeds Glatzer has ALS and now speaks via a computers voice synthesizer. As its choice of pronoun indicates Sarah Polleys Away from Her considered early-onset Alzheimers from the perspective of a man who watches his wifes consciousness disappear. Still Alice takes a riskier strategy attempting to show its protagonists experience from the inside. Glatzer and Westmoreland picked the right actress for the job. When Alice first gets the verdict from a neurologist the camera focuses only on her face in one uninterrupted take. (The superb cinematography is by Denis Lenoir who shot Olivier Assayas Carlos.) This strategy is repeated again and again until Alice finally -- and literally -- vanishes. The movie isnt interested in what the woman leaves behind only in the process of her dissolution. Contemporary technology helps with this. Alice has ongoing conversations with her husband (whose coldness Baldwin fails to make believable) and her children (especially Lydia who surprises). But many of her dialogues are with her own smartphone. As if turning an old Bob Newhart routine into tragedy Alice prompts herself with prerecorded questions testing what shes forgotten and can possibly remember. Perhaps most important she uses the device to leave instructions for her future self a step-by-step guide to suicide. This plan imbues the story with intense foreboding but also an element of farce. Alice may or may not be mentally capable of killing herself when the time comes adding uncertainty to a narrative that is in most regards inevitable. Still Alice would be better if it didnt mirror the inevitability of Alices decline with other predictable elements. Through Lydia Alice is introduced to two plays Chekhovs Three Sisters and Tony Kushners Angels in America. Their borrowed themes echo a little too heavily. So do composer Ilan Eshkeris tremulous violins which ape Penderecki during Alices most agitated moments. As the filmmakers keep reminding us Alice is a woman of words who is now losing them. But the movies most expressive element is Moores face slowly moving from engagement flecked with worry to disconnection and blankness. As the memories evaporate only that face is still Alice.

At the age of 50 and at the peak of her career as a distinguished professor of linguistics at Columbia University Alice Howland begins to experience memory glitches.

In Still Alice Moores performance as a Columbia linguistics professor exhibiting signs of early-onset Alzheimers is so extraordinary in every detail that it should never have to be considered a payment for benefits past due. Moore shows us acting at its best alive with ferocity and feeling and committed to truth. Moores Alice Howland is an expert in her field. She juggles being a wife to John (Alec Baldwin) a biologist and mother to their three adult children played by Kate Bosworth Hunter Parrish and a wonderfully vibrant and contentious Kristen Stewart. The family reacts in various ways to Alices worsening condition with the rebel daughter - a wanna-be actress who disdains family - becoming her willing caretaker. Even when Still Alice sometimes slips into sentiment Moore and Stewart are funny fierce and glorious. The film like the book by neuroscientist Lisa Genova that inspired it isnt really about other people. The focus is on Alice. Its through her head and heart that we see the world. The effect is devastating but not hopeless. Moore reveals a woman who doesnt yet know what comes with the dying of the light in her eyes. She can guess from her childrens fear that they might inherit her disease from her husbands decision to take a job in another state from her own decision to record a message to her diminished self that would trick that later self into suicide. Admirably the film refuses to hold Alice at a distance as a specimen. That we feel with Alice and through her owes much to the commitment of two men behind the camera. They are Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland (Quinceanera) who wrote and directed Still Alice while Glatzer coped with the debilitating effects of ALS a disease that attacks the body as relentlessly as Alzheimers attacks the mind. Glatzer and Westmoreland who married in 2013 clearly have a personal stake in the story being told a stake we come to share. Still Alice propelled by the blazing artistry of Moores performance is an emotional powerhouse. It will get to you.

Moore is up for a best actress Oscar for this role. Photo JOJO WHILDEN Still Alice review Moore gives bravura performance 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""Still Alice"" is a good movie in a genre often scorned and usually best avoided the disease genre. As a superior expression of its type it avoids the worst pitfalls but it conforms to the basic pattern First a small sign that can easily be ignored. Second a bad sign that shouldnt be ignored. Then confirmation. Then diagnosis invariably of something absolutely horrible. In this case early onset Alzheimers disease. Its a film that will spark the darkest hypochondriacal imaginings next time you cant remember the backup catcher for the 69 Mets (J.C. Martin) but the movie is useful too. Alzheimers is hardly rare and ""Still Alice"" contributes to viewers understanding not only of the anguish of having it but of how the disease progresses and of the ways in which patients conceal it. With the parents of so many Baby Boomers going through this right now the story of an actual Baby Boomer getting it becomes both a plea for empathy and an irresistible horror story. Yet none of this would matter if it werent for Julianne Moore. Inevitably ""Still Alice"" becomes the showcase for her finely calibrated onscreen disintegration which is at every moment convincing disturbing and personal. Life provides many opportunities for embarrassment -- speaking out of turn having no money being sick ... But really what can compare with losing your mind -- slowly -- and seeing that look cross peoples eyes? That oh-no look. It must be even worse for someone whose entire identity whose edge in the world is bound up with intellectual achievement. This is the case of Alice a linguistics professor at Columbia and a thought leader in her field who in the midst of a lecture on the use of language somehow cant pull up the word ""lexicon."" That would be like a gastroenterologist somehow forgetting the word ""colon."" Soon she is with her husband (Alec Baldwin) sitting in a neurologists office looking at a brain scan that wouldnt look good even to laymen in the audience. Too much of that screen is lit up. What follows is the progress of a disease as well as the progress of a performance which details the different levels and stages of an ongoing misery. Early in the film Alice while still functional records a message to her future demented self. Late in the film Alice watches the recording and its one of those scenes that Oscars are made of. By seeing these two versions of Moore the audience must appreciate in one glance the extent of her acting journey. Like all tales of Alzheimers ""Still Alice"" based on Lisa Genovas novel is also a family story though the casting of Alec Baldwin as the husband is a little odd. In recent years in films such as ""Blue Jasmine"" as well as in his TV work Baldwin has come to personify the vain selfish operator. To see Baldwin here is to assume one of two things either that the husband is shifty or that in a case of unexpected casting hes playing a sweet guy. But as presented here the husband is a straight-down-the-line ambiguous figure neither particularly good nor bad. Baldwin is fine in the role but as an actor hes such a big statement it feels almost wasteful not to make more use of him. ""Still Alice"" does make good use of Kristen Stewart who plays the aspiring actress daughter a black sheep in a family of intellectuals. Stewart is so unfussy so natural in her depiction of love so coming from a place of spontaneity and truth in every moment that Im willing to forget that the whole ""Twilight"" thing ever happened. One last point For all the movies honesty the reality of Alzheimers disease is a lot worse than what you see in ""Still Alice."" Perhaps directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland made a calculation as to how much an audience can take. They were right. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

As the memory begins to erode--slowly at first like waves pulling sand back to the sea then all at once like a tsunami--the victim remains present in body yet unreachably distant in mind. They are there and not there--visible to their loved ones (who are also victims) but invisible to themselves. Based on a best-selling 2007 novel by Lisa Genova Still Alice directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland grapples with this maddeningly ruthless affliction with remarkable compassion and grace. Its not the first film to do so--in recent years Iris The Notebook and Away From Her to name just a few have all dealt with dementia with varying degrees of sensitivity and schmaltz. But even though Glatzer and Westmorelands film occasionally flirts with three-hankie disease-of-the-week Lifetime-network cliches it mostly rises above them thanks to a pair of stunning performances. One thats pretty much expected the other less so. Julianne Moore stars as Alice Howland a Columbia University linguistics professor whos stricken with an early-onset form of Alzheimers at the shockingly young age of 50. As the film opens we see her celebrating her birthday with her adoring husband (Alec Baldwin) and three grown children (Kate Bosworth Hunter Parrish and Kristen Stewart). The family of Manhattanites appears perfect as if they all just hailed a cab from Woody Allen land. But because we know going in what the film is about we cant help scrutinizing Alices behavior for telltale displays of forgetfulness. Moore is too nuanced an actress too immune to artifice to tip her hand so obviously. Instead she gradually reveals small hints of her inevitable decline. First she loses her train of thought while giving a lecture. Then she gets lost while jogging. The former could pass for the sort of ""senior moment"" all of us experience when we cant remember where we left the car keys or whether we turned off the oven. But the latter is an undeniably seismic episode of white-knuckle terror. And Moore whose face slackens into an expression of faraway confusion strips the moment of melodrama and makes us feel the sheer panic of someone whose brain is beginning to flicker away. Going on 20 years now Moore is someone whos been so reliably good for so long that weve probably taken her for granted. But her subtle heartbreaking decline as Alice--from her initial diagnosis to her daily struggle to hold on to her identity and dignity to her eventual disappearance in plain sight--is among her most devastating performances. More surprising is just how terrific Kristen Stewart is as her youngest child Lydia. As Alices mind grows dimmer by the day her marriage begins to show signs of stress. But she also manages to grow closer to Lydia an aspiring actress who has always been the child she was the hardest on. Stewart who in many of her previous films has seemed to turn her rebellious moodiness into a bit of a default pose delivers a vulnerability and empathy we havent seen from her before. Late in the film as Lydia rehearses a scene for an upcoming audition with her barely there mother trying to make a connection before its too late she asks Alice if she knows what the scene is about. Moores face is expressionless a blank. Then you notice that somewhere behind her glassy eyes a thought is fighting to get out. She manages to say one word ""Love."" For that brief moment--and it may be the last--shes still Alice.

When we wake up in the middle of the night with outlandish fears we strike reassuring bargains with ourselves If I lose my sight Ill still have music. If I lose my hearing Ill still have color and light. If I lose both Ill still know what flowers smell like. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But what if the person youve spent years becoming were to be locked away permanently in a body -- your body -- thats still thriving? In Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzers Still Alice thats exactly what happens to 50-year-old Alice an Ivy League linguistics professor -- played by Julianne Moore -- who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers. In an attempt to accept the inevitable she makes those reassuring bargains. By the time the inevitable happens she wont even remember what they were.Who is Alice once shes no longer able to speak or recognize family members let alone teach or read or essentially do any of the things that used to define her? The answer is embedded in the title of the film (which is based on a 2009 novel by Lisa Genova) and its an indication of the movies melancholy hopefulness While Still Alice isnt exactly the sort of cheerful pick-me-up youd seek out on a dreary January day its so fine-grained so attuned to the prosaic nuances of everyday life even under extraordinary circumstances that it doesnt register as depressing. The key maybe is Moores performance one of the finest of last year. (Still Alice opened in limited release for an Oscar-qualifying run in late 2014.) Moore maps Alices gradual debilitation -- or rather her awareness of her gradual debilitation -- like a pioneer in a strange new land watching the ship that carried her there slip away into the distance a dot of meaning that will soon mean nothing.Film DetailsCritics Pick Still Alice RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time99 More Info Trailer But even if the ship is gone the pioneer lives. Thats what Moore ultimately conveys the encouraging suggestion that our inner lives carry on even when our ability to connect with the outside world has dissipated. In the early scenes we see Alice doing all the things that have shaped her life When she gives a talk at UCLA shes a confident visitor from her home turf Columbia. At the podium shes polished and relaxed and articulate until she blips on a word the kind of thing that happens almost every day to anyone whos hit middle age. As she flips through her minds index cards for the term she needs -- hastily covering for herself by making an awkward joke about having had too much champagne the night before -- silence hangs weightily in the room for seconds that seem like hours. She rights herself and all is well but we can see she knows something is wrong.When Alice finally gets the diagnosis from her neurologist (played in a small but delicately textured performance by Stephen Kunken) she keeps it a secret from her physician husband John (Alec Baldwin). In the most stunning scene she wakes him in the night -- the clock reads 142 marking one of those post-midnight moments when nocturnal fears suddenly become too mighty to bear -- and breaks the news to him in a rush of anxiety dotted with scraps of irrefutable fact. Bleary from sleep he tries to calm her saying that hes sure it cant be as bad as all that. The moment so deftly played by both actors is potent in its very ordinariness capturing the essence of a marriage in a snapshot.Alice and Johns grown children react to her illness in different ways Son Tom (Hunter Parrish) studying to be a doctor responds with helpless concern. Unassailably proper Anna (Kate Bosworth) whos trying to become a mother herself seems eager to control the situation as if that were even possible. Only the couples wayward daughter Kristen Stewarts Lydia whos decamped to Los Angeles to attempt an acting career is able to deal with Alice in her ever-changing here and now. What Lydia feels for her mother is a kind of exasperated compassion and Stewart channels that beautifully If shes adept at the nuances of eye-rolling shes also able to pack a cosmos of empathy into a single glance.Glatzer and Westmoreland -- partners in work and in life who directed the 2006 Quinceanera as well as The Last of Robin Hood from 2013 a charming and overlooked picture about the final years of Errol Flynns life -- shape Alices story with such delicate matter-of-factness that it never tips into Lifetime-movie territory. Their sensitivity toward the material may stem partly from the fact that Glatzer was diagnosed with A.L.S. in 2013 and the debilitating effects of the illness have begun to take their toll. But the triumph of Still Alice is that its not about an illness; its about a person. Moore with her dramatically fragile coloring and mother-of-pearl skin may have the translucence of a seashell. But her Alice is never just a shell of a person. The human body comes in handy because its the thing we walk around in. But its chief job is as a steward of the secrets of the heart and it would be hubris for any of us to claim we know their breadth.Written and directed by Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer.

By Anthony Lane Julianne Moore stars in a movie directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland.   Credit Illustration by Simon Prades The life that is led by Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) appears to be perfect although its not a perfection that everyone would crave. She is gracious beautiful and fifty years old with three equally beautiful children Anna (Kate Bosworth) Tom (Hunter Parrish) and Lydia (Kristen Stewart). Alice is a professor of linguistics at Columbia and the author of ""From Neurons to Nouns."" She dresses well eats well and cooks a flawless Christmas dinner. She is married to John (Alec Baldwin) a senior research physician who adores her. They have an apartment on the Upper West Side and a house at the beach. What could possibly go wrong? The answer is ""everything"" as Alice would realize if she had read Sophocles in college. Or more recently if she had grabbed a coffee with the heroine of Woody Allens ""Blue Jasmine"" who was also married to Alec Baldwin. Look what happened to her. The mantrap that ensnares Alice however is not poverty or adultery but Alzheimers disease which snaps into her without mercy. She goes from minor patches of forgetfulness such as any of us might experience to near-wipeout. Her kind of Alzheimers is rare as though the Fates had decided for a laugh to butcher the exclusive high-achieving joy of her existence with a no less specialized brand of disease. In the words of her doctor ""With familial early-onset things can go fast. And actually with people who have a high level of education things can go faster."" In Alices case ""familial"" means first that she probably inherited Alzheimers from her father who died of alcoholism and second that her children have a fifty-per-cent chance of carrying the mutated gene. All of them should they want their futures told will have to be tested. This is one hell of a burden for them and it places hefty dramatic demands on the writers and directors of ""Still Alice"" Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland who adapted the novel by Lisa Genova. How can they dole out the perplexity as it descends on each child? Well they dont. The results of the tests are reported in a quick phone call and thats that a loss of nerve that tells you much about the movie as a whole. Time and again as it comes to the next stage of deterioration or distress it flinches. Try laying it beside Michael Hanekes ""Amour"" which shows the effect of a stroke on an elderly woman no less refined than Alice and on her loved ones. Haneke knows the worst and considers it his duty to show it; Glatzer and Westmoreland want us to know just enough and no more. For many viewers thatll do fine. Once theyve seen Alice wet her pants because she cant remember where the bathroom is no more details are required. Why push things any further? ""Still Alice"" remains as polite as informed and as cautiously compassionate as the society that it depicts. It makes sure from the start that we grasp the irony of Alices plight. Lecturing on ""the relationship between memory and computation that is the very essence of communication"" she forgets a word. Later speaking to health professionals and fellow-sufferers she summons the courage to get through her speech and is applauded at the end--though not by her husband who is away on business. You can feel Baldwin itching to make his character not merely square and industrious but troublesome and even cruel; the rest of the film though doesnt want to go there. It prefers the softening touch a score by Ilan Eshkeri that urges mourning upon us with slow-paced piano and strings; a reading by Lydia from ""Angels in America"" about ascending souls; and even clips of old home movies from a grainy past that is now being swept away. That was a pretty cheap trick when it was used in ""Philadelphia"" and its no less manipulative--and effective--more than twenty years on. Despite all that and in the absence of the anger and the wildness that are crouched and caged within this most terrible of themes ""Still Alice"" is worth watching for the sake of Julianne Moore. She has always compounded sweetness with steel and both are brandished here. The smile that Alice gives as her utterance falters is more heartbreaking for being so radiant; we understand at once what it will cost this particular woman to put on a good show and a happy face. At the other extreme is the message that when still compos mentis she leaves for herself--or for a later version of that self--on her laptop issuing instructions for suicide. The tone of practical plainness is wonderfully caught. ""Hi Alice I am you"" she begins. To be and not to be at the same time that is the question that Moore would if unleashed have pursued to its tragic limit. ""Still Alice"" gives her only half a chance. It has taken a while for Paddington Bear to arrive on the big screen. Michael Bonds ""A Bear Called Paddington"" was published in 1958. Sales of that book and its sequels run to more than thirty-five million copies and the hero has assumed many forms the largest being the bulbous inflatable--complete with his trademark duffel coat and floppy hat--that has drifted along in the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade. Enormity though does Paddington no favors; smallness of stature is intrinsic to his appeal. In the new film which is entitled simply ""Paddington"" he is described as being around three feet six. Its ideal viewers will be of similar height. The movie is true to the characters essence as distilled by Bond Paddington armed with little more than impeccable manners and marmalade is dispatched by his Aunt Lucy from ""Darkest Peru"" to London where he is taken in by the Browns. In the stories Peru stays utterly unknown and our first indication that the film will beat a fresh path comes as it reveals flickering black-and-white footage of a British expedition to the Peruvian rain forest during which an explorer befriends some resident bears. They are left with the firm belief that London is a place to dream about trust in and visit. The scene is set. As a rule too much backstory is dead weight but ""Paddington"" proves a surprising exception. The writer and director Paul King scatters the tale with handfuls of eccentric charm first in the forest and then in the home of the Browns. At one point borrowing freely from Wes Anderson he frames it as a living dolls house with each member of the family hard at work or play in a different room. There is Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville) a risk analyst by trade and therefore allergic to shenanigans; Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins) tenderhearted and brightly clad; the glum Judy (Madeleine Harris) and her brother Jonathan (Samuel Joslin); and the housekeeper Mrs. Bird (Julie Walters) who complains of feeble knees. There is a definite dash of ""Mary Poppins"" in this setup the idea being that the father fussing and frustrated should have the starch wrung out of him by the advent of a kindly outsider. Families are a puzzle and it is the job of a Paddington or a Mary to solve them. As for plot Bond managed to do without one stringing up episodes like handkerchiefs on a clothesline. That looseness was preserved on British TV where a puppet Paddington ambled hither and thither in stop-motion. (The narrator was Michael Hordern whose wise and tolerant tones were also used for the voice-over of ""Barry Lyndon."") King needs something tougher and that means Nicole Kidman. She plays an evil taxidermist bent on stealing and stuffing this rare Peruvian species (""Ursa marmalada"" we learn) though by the look of her--the helmet of blond hair and the tightly buttoned outfits--I reckon that what she really wants is to tie him up and get all grizzly on him whispering ""Keep the red hat on"" into his little ears. Such villainy feels out of whack with the Paddington myth which is remarkable for its lack of threat. Bond admitted that the Brown household reflected ""the rather safer prewar world which I remember from my childhood"" and the movie doesnt shy from that nostalgia. Mrs. Brown suggests consulting an encyclopedia instead of going online and the bulk of the wizardry is mechanical crammed with things that swivel shunt and lock. Meanwhile we barely notice that Paddington himself bright-eyed and bushy-pelted is so modern as to be nonexistent forged from C.G.I. Even more up-to-date is the political timbre a calculated move I suspect in a year when both British and American elections will be fraught with talk of immigration. ""Please Look After This Bear"" reads a tag around Paddingtons neck and it is to that basic plea rather than to the alert of ""stranger danger"" which is Mr. Browns initial reaction that the movie accedes reminding us--somewhat naggingly--of the heros status as a refugee. Will children however flock to the film because it tells them how they should vote if they could? Or because they like the bit where Paddington gets his head stuck in a toilet? Wait and see.

"Its Dumpcember With Still Alice and Miss Julie the Awards-Season Glut Is Here. Duck << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Its Dumpcember With Still Alice and Miss Julie the Awards-Season Glut Is Here. Duck Sony Pictures Classics Movies December 10 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Its said that the quality films are saved for the end of the year -- the ""serious"" ""adult"" ""issue"" movies; the musicals the statements the Eastwoods. The studios -- all of them not just the major ones -- hold their fire until as close to awards qualification as possible (thats December 31). December is now as much a dumping ground for movies as January. But while we tend to think of January as a junkyard Decembers leavings are classier tonier desperately reserved for Academy voters. Its a consignment shop into which everything from some of this years best foreign-language films to the most eagerly anticipated Hollywood dramas gets stuffed. More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverage All the gambling and strategizing and holding on -- all the so-called qualifying runs -- are ruining (or at least perverting) committed moviegoing. The qualifying runs make sense in a way. Some movies need this ""awards push"" to attract audiences. Two examples -- Still Alice and Miss Julie -- opened last week. Dont be misled by those titles; theyre not bands. Ones a lousy showcase for two very good performances on one of these qualifying runs (here for a week and back to stay on the day after next months Oscar nominations). The other from a tiny distributor is among the best drama classes 13.50 can buy and it probably should be released in a less absurdly jammed month. Still Alice is one of those disease movies that let an actor go big or go crazy all the way to the podiums. But here the disease is Alzheimers and the actor is Julianne Moore. This isnt an empty-yourself-out kind of affliction. Moore has to do a lot of watching and waiting. The studios poster has Moore swathed in flannel sitting in a wicker chair staring blankly ahead. Its both a complete mischaracterization of the performance and a good summation of the mediocre shorthand at work. To be fair how should you market a movie like this? Thank god for those awards huh? Moores character Alice Howland is a highly respected linguistics professor at Columbia University whose concerns about her failing memory culminate in a diagnosis of a rare hereditary form of early-onset dementia. This is a personal apocalypse scenario for a young person (Alice is 50). She goes for runs and cant remember how to get back to her brownstone. She loses her way in lectures that shes been giving for years. The most suspenseful scenes involve whether shell remember the words she puts on a reminder board in her kitchen. Alices husband John -- a biologist played by Alec Baldwin -- starts off as one of those optimistic deniers until he gets a load of his future and turns into something else. Their three children -- played by Kristen Stewart Hunter Parrish and a tightly wound tamped down Kate Bosworth -- stand to inherit the disease but only Stewarts character Lydia takes an interest in her mothers subtle downward transformation. Lydias an actress so theres the possibility shes interested in Alices process and coping mechanisms. But thats not the character Stewart is acting. Shes playing a listener who hasnt felt listened to by her mother. Alice doesnt like Lydias career choice -- theres too much risk and not enough money. Its not quite respectable. The bratty truculent response youd anticipate from the stereotype of a character Stewart would play never happens. Instead Stewart plays wisdom and curiosity and an almost wise love. She might never get the credit she deserves as a performer -- not at this age. I think some actors know how good she is. But theres also this perception of attitude baggage and cool that seems to work against her even as the same tendencies bolster the personas of guys like Ryan Gosling and Shia LaBeouf -- ""bad boys."" Stewart seems to be a better scene partner than they are. Shes not trying to win. Shes there to facilitate and maybe even to learn. The listening stuff here isnt an act. Thats what she brought to Welcome to the Rileys from a few years ago and what she gives to Juliette Binoche in Olivier Assayass Clouds of Sils Maria a very different movie about actresses that opens next year. When you watch Stewart play Lydia you believe youre watching a daughter come to grips with her mothers psychological deterioration a deterioration that might be the least ""actressy"" interpretation you could hope to find. Whats irritating about that poster is that while such a blank stare might capture what it looks like to have Alzheimers it doesnt capture how Moore plays having Alzheimers. Theres nothing blank about her nothing lost. She plays Alice somewhere between struggle and resignation a woman who drives herself to prison. You get the sense that this is a woman leveling with us -- like the professor dying of cancer in Margaret Edsons play Wit. ""I wish I had cancer"" Alice says as plain as day. If only the movie were as good as she and Stewart are. The camera keeps busying itself as if its too uncomfortable to keep still. All of Alices academic work with language seems meant to make her getting a disease of incoherence ironic. In one of the opening scenes she cites Darwin writing about ""the babble of young children."" There are word puzzles for mobile phones and forced scatological humiliations. But theres not much built around Alice no dramatic infrastructure. The writer-directors Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer working from a novel by Lisa Genova are a couple of entertainment production veterans. They married last year and have been battling Glatzers recent ALS diagnosis. So theres something especially personal going on here but what comes to the screen feels safely detached meandering occasionally maudlin familiar yet harsh. Still Alice is less a movie than furniture a slab of moments intended to elevate a pedestal for a performance (or two as it turns out). Any scene between Stewart and Moore is a reason to remain seated. But there are so many passages meant to point to strife rather than bring it to life. Most of the other characters are made of air. Poor Baldwin has one of the worst parts of his life a careerist stuck spouting bromides and scientific jargon he cant make plausible. At some point hes slumped over a laptop and says defeatedly to Moore whos stirring a pot at the stove ""Seems like beta-endorphin just doesnt impact the microphage activity."" Maybe the set was a hoot because who could deliver a line like that on the first try? What should we do with a movie like Still Alice a movie too weak to release into the wilds of the movie-theater ecosystem without a gilded hook? You might think of Michael Hanekes Amour which was more of a chamber piece about an elderly upper-middle-class couple at the end of their lives. Hanekes a director who can fill you with dread. Unexpectedly Amours march to death was more of a dance. The movie had texture and surprise. But its the loosening of Hanekes declarative style into a kind of poetry that shook you up. He was open to spiritual alternatives. Still Alice is over before it even gets close to that. It also makes you worry -- as these disease movies do -- that medical misfortune befalls only bourgeoisie. Its far too fond of Moore to be less than flattering to her. So instead it cheats life death and us. Its so rigged that when Alice still functional in decline gives a speech to a packed room the audience rises and applauds. This movie is its own award-season triumph. Moores standing ovation is built in.  Wrekin Hill Entertainment Mark Harriss most recent awards-season column took on the stunted thinking about the Best Actress race. The nominees seem preordained without their movies having even opened wide. No ones talking for instance about Liv Ullmanns adaptation of August Strindbergs 1888 play Miss Julie with Jessica Chastain. Not yet. Maybe never. (See the ""1888 play"" part of that sentence.) The movie opened on a single screen in New York presumably for a spell with a return in January. This is a better film than Still Alice and not because its Strindberg (although come on). Ullmann has really thought about what it means to stage a film about people running away toward each other about loosening up and sealing off emotional valves. Doors fly open and slam shut; monologues take place in their jambs; one character asserts dominion just by standing over another. The actors -- Chastain Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton -- swing their arms and contort their bodies which seems right for a story about torturous psychosexual dominance. Julie is now an English barons daughter. While her fathers away at a Saturday ball she stays behind and flirts with John (Farrell) her fathers Irish valet whos seeing Kathleen (Morton) the manors Scottish cook. Ullmanns relocated the story from Sweden to somewhere in Ireland so the class distinctions come through first in the accents. The servants are chowder; Julies is a broth. But the seduction she lays on John is thick and full of commands ""Sit down"" ""Kiss my shoe"" that sort of thing. He complies trembling with restraint when she inserts herself between his legs. Ullmann tosses in cutaways to Kathleen whos down in her room. She would appear to be unscathed except all of this jostling and inserting is going on in her kitchen which aggravates the insult and enriches the vulgarity. This is one of those sexual tug-of-wars where the three players take turns being the top bottom and middle. The twin engines for each exchange are the powers of gender and class. The characters can never be equal. John wants to climb atop the pedestal that Julie wants to descend. (Heres a movie in which a pedestal actually means something) What Ullmanns done is create the ideal conditions for these three to do electrifying work with each other. She maintains control so they can lose it. The up-and-down of the dynamic among them might be unstable but Ullmann strikes a balance within it anyway. Her years with Ingmar Bergman and decades of stagecraft are always welcome in the movies. She gets actors to work with juicy emotional clarity. At her most ferocious her M.O. as a director of actors is ""Fuck restraint."" And so here To hell with it. Morton stands in a door pacing in principled rage. Farrell does things with his face that dont seem human and yet are intensely movingly emotional and Chastain express-trains from lust to confusion to hysterics to delirium. Her performance culminates in one of the greatest tirades Ive ever seen. Maybe all three of them are too much but they each have complete command over themselves and total understanding of the material. Whether hes screaming or melting Farrell is especially good with the intricacies of the language. Farrell was the Kristen Stewart of 10 or 12 years ago and he still seems to be apologizing for being ""difficult."" Hes a stronger actor now but you worry no one will care not even in fun junk like that Fright Night remake from 2011 and certainly not when hes trying to wrestle scenes from Chastain and Morton who appears to have plumped herself out for the role. That I think is what youd be willing to do for Ullmann grow in every way possible. Who knows what the movies prize-givers will do with something as physical and smartly done as Miss Julie? Ullmanns skill with actors equals someone like Alejandro G. Inarritus but she too is doing chamber work -- worse repertory chamber work -- and she doesnt have an easy gimmick to call attention to her ingenuity. Shes got great Category 5 acting instead. But you dont need awards to deal with that. You need FEMA.

Linda Kallerus/Song Pictures Classics          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Julianne Moore is startlingly good in ""Still Alice"" playing a Columbia linguistics professor grappling with early-onset Alzheimers disease. Before the diagnosis she appears to have a model life a caring scientist husband (Alec Baldwin) a dream job and three devoted children (the most unsettled of them well played by Kristin Stewart is a struggling actress in Los Angeles).Alices decline is rendered essentially from her own point of view but by focusing so intently on her the co-writing and directing team of Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland skimp on the realities one might reasonably expect from this story (adapted from a novel by neuroscientist Lisa Genova). Alices children undergoing genetic testing for the disease seem eerily unfazed by the results; this gregarious and esteemed woman apparently has few friends or colleagues to interact with; her husband is the Rock of Gibraltar; and so on. Its a strange movie - simultaneously rawly realistic and airbrushed. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for mature themes and brief language including a sexual reference.)

If the persons acting is so great why isnt the movie better? Since we do not (yet) possess the technology that can extract actors from their context -- and since a movie is a complicated collaborative and holistic enterprise not a neutral stage for thespians - then what the hell are you trying to say? Is the damn thing worth seeing or not? And now here I am face to face with ""Still Alice"" also known as the WASP Family Christmas Early-Onset Alzheimers Special dealing with that precise contradiction.In fairness ""Still Alice"" is not exactly a terrible film or at least it doesnt seem like one until you step away and start to think about it. Its a crisp and streamlined melodrama from the writing-directing duo of Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland (of ""Quinceanera"" and ""The Last of Robin Hood"") who turn a tear-jerking commercial novel by Lisa Genova into a showcase for the luminous Julianne Moore likely Oscar-bound for her mesmerizing portrayal of a brilliant academic descending into dementia. Moore plays Alice Howland a composed and successful Columbia linguistics professor who begins to forget things right around her 50th birthday. At first its just the occasional word she cant get hold of - a linguist forgetting the word ""lexicon"" ha ha. (The next one she cant remember is ""pariah."") But then she introduces herself to her adult sons girlfriend (whom shes already met) and gets lost running on the Columbia campus where shes worked for years.This is meant to be dramatic irony at work I suppose Alice is intelligent beautiful accomplished and rich but that cannot protect her from freakishly bad medical news. She has a happy marriage with a workaholic medical researcher played by Alec Baldwin (the default setting for all self-absorbed husband roles). She has three adult children two of them thriving. (Her unsuccessful actress daughter is played by Kristen Stewart another ha ha who is actually very good.) Alice has only a minor and highly normative amount of family discord she could pass for 10 years younger than her chronological age and she lives inside an Upper West Side bubble of white-people privilege and decency. Her kitchen is flooded with light every meal includes fresh vegetables and good wine there are never dirty dishes in the bedroom or dirty laundry on the floor. She has a standing order at Pinkberry the ""natural"" yogurt with blueberries and shredded coconut. In other words this person would be supremely annoying were she a real person and not Julianne Moore; we are almost tempted to root for her downfall (and then to feel bad about it).Alice has also been covering for her mental deterioration for a long time most likely. As her movie-neurologist explains high-functioning and highly educated people develop all kinds of coping strategies She relies on smartphone scheduling a little more literally than the rest of us she Googles family recipes she can no longer remember and she leaves herself a trail of virtual breadcrumbs from labeled folders on her computer desktop to Post-it notes on the kitchen counter. Forgetting the word ""lexicon"" is just the sign that the facade is breaking down. Viewed in the abstract ""Still Alice"" is an utterly conventional movie-of-the-week whose every step is familiar. But theres nothing formulaic or rehearsed about Moores performance; her moments of midnight terror fierce resolution painful struggle and worsening confusion burn with passionate intensity. Theres a devastating scene late in the film that I wont give away when Alice tries to follow the step-by-step instructions she left for herself in a video a few months earlier about exactly what to do when she can no longer answer basic factual questions about her own life. You Might Also Like Moore is on-screen in every scene and almost every frame as we follow Alice from the early days of her shocking diagnosis when she tries to push forward with a semblance of normal life to later episodes when she cannot reliably recognize her own children or locate the bathroom in her familys beach house. (You have to have a beach house in the first place let us note before you can get lost in it.) She is nicely balanced by Baldwin and Stewart who serve as a Kubler-Ross Greek chorus first seeking to deny the obvious transformation in Alice then trying to bargain with it and contain it. I suppose the question for all viewers will be whether the excellence of the acting and the cleanliness of the filmmaking make up for the fact that ""Still Alice"" is basically a Lifetime production injected with a little indie DNA.Dont talk to me about realism or relevance when it comes to ""Still Alice"" by the way. Yes millions of American families deal with Alzheimers and with our rapidly aging population thats only going to become more common. But Alices diagnosis is truly exotic Early-onset Alzheimers in ones 50s is exceptionally rare and her variety is rarer still a genetic form that was inherited and can be transmitted. In other words each of her kids has a 50 percent chance of carrying her flawed genetic code - and if they do they are virtually certain to develop early Alzheimers symptoms themselves. Yes it could happen and it has happened but thats not the point. Cannibalism and crocodile attacks happen too but wed have no difficulty identifying them as outlandish devices in drama. Moore gives a gorgeous and compassionate performance and if she brings home the hardware in awards season she deserves it. (Yeah I cried and if youve known or loved anyone with this disease you probably will too.) But consider the grim and hilarious reality that a 54-year-old actress at her level of talent and radiance has to play a woman with Alzheimers to become a major player in the Oscar race. That reveals way too much about the movie industry and its priorities. Aided by witty and understated work from Baldwin and Stewart and the capable direction of Glatzer and Westmoreland Moore does her utmost to pull ""Still Alice"" toward the realm of meaningful social drama. Lets put it this way Its a way better movie than it ought to be but not good enough to escape its pulpy mendacious roots.""Still Alice"" opens this week for an Oscar-qualifying one-week run in New York and Los Angeles with national release to follow in January.

"Still Alice review Julianne Moore in an Alzheimers movie based on the Lisa Genova book. Slate Sign In Sign Up Still Alice Julianne Moore Is Hauntingly Profound as a 50-Year-Old Professor With Alzheimers Still Alice Julianne Moore Is Hauntingly Profound as a 50-Year-Old Professor With Alzheimers Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 5 2014 323 PM The Tears Come on Their Own It doesnt take much to make the Alzheimers story Still Alice a heart-wrenching film Just aim the camera at Julianne Moores face and leave it. By Dana Stevens Julianne Moore as Alice Howland in Still Alice. Courtesy of Linda Kallerus/Sony Pictures Classics For several days after watching Still Alice a tender and deeply sad adaptation of Lisa Genovas best-selling novel about a woman living with early-onset Alzheimers I caught myself scouring my everyday behavior for evidence of my own impending decline. Why couldnt I remember the name of a familiar character actor when his face popped up on TV? (It turned out to be Zeljko Ivanek whose name youd think would be simple to remember if not to pronounce.) What were my house keys doing in the dogs empty water bowl? The degrees by which Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) a linguistics professor whos diagnosed at the shockingly young age of 50 becomes aware of her condition are gradual enough at first that blunders as small as this might matter. And Moore is so hauntingly good as Alice that having spent the films swift-moving 101 minutes in her company you cant help feeling youve already walked some way down the path of dementia with her. The script isnt always up to the level of Moores performance which is so profound and simple devoid of sentimentality or actressy self-regard. I didnt yet know while watching it that the production history of Still Alice uncannily mirrors the films themes and story. The two directors who also co-wrote the script are married and one of them Richard Glatzer was diagnosed with ALS shortly before he and husband Wash Westmoreland decided to adapt Genovas novel--in fact it was the shock of that diagnosis that prompted them to take on the material. During the filming Glatzers condition deteriorated to the point of needing to communicate through a text-to-speech iPad app. The wisdom lent by this experience--of being a couple struggling with degenerative illness while collaborating on a film about that very subject--may be what gives Still Alice its quiet unmelodramatic directness. Glatzer and Westmoreland dont need to stack the emotional deck on Alices behalf or wring tears from the irony of a brilliant linguists cognitive decline. They just leave the camera on Moores beautiful but increasingly faraway face and our tears come on their own. Before Alice Howlands diagnosis she has just about everything a person could reasonably want from life a tenured professorship at an Ivy League school teaching a subject she cares passionately about. An adoring successful research-scientist husband (Alec Baldwin). Three grown children (Kate Bosworth Hunter Parrish and Kristen Stewart) who are all more or less happily making their way in the world. A Manhattan brownstone thats pristine and exquisitely appointed even by the standards of Hollywood-movie brownstones. Alice has even lucked into whatever genetic oddity it is that creates human specimens as impossibly good-looking as Julianne Moore. But Alices lifelong luck is about to run out. A few days after her 50th birthday she goes jogging on the Columbia University campus and suddenly gets disoriented. Standing outside the library shes used for years she cant remember how to get back home--a fact the filmmakers establish not with dialogue or voiceover but through the use of unsettling music (the score is by Ilan Eshkeri) and shallow focus that turns Alices surroundings into an indistinguishable blur (the warm-hued cinematography is by Denis Lenoir known for his work with the French masters Olivier Assayas and Jacques Audiard). Top Comment I havent seen this movie but I cant help but wonder if it doesnt sugarcoat this vile disease the way Hollywood traditionally has?  More... -Leif L-phew [VSOP] Join In Still Alices script isnt always up to the level of Moores performance which is so profound and simple so devoid of sentimentality or actressy self-regard that it almost seems obscene to mention the word Oscar (even if I am now firmly on Team Julianne). The stages of Alices decline are sometimes too clearly signposted and foreshadowed in a way that can make the audience feel were simply hunkered down waiting for the other shoe to drop--though to be fair that faintly tedious sense of entrapment probably resembles the actual experience of loving an Alzheimers victim. There are breaks in the entropy though including one genuinely inspiring scene in which Alice in the middle stages of her decline is asked to give a speech for a gathering of fellow Alzheimers patients and their families. Having stubbornly insisted on preparing her talk according to the exacting linguistic standards of her old professorial self Alice seems to have set herself up for humiliating failure. But the speech is an unexpected triumph--though Alices radiant smile at the enthusiastic ovation she receives is edged with sorrow. This carefully worded and painstakingly rehearsed speech we realize was intended as an official farewell to the mastery of language she once so effortlessly commanded. As Alices mind begins to slip her relationships shift in surprising ways. Her apparently stable marriage begins to reveals its cracks even as she grows closer to her youngest daughter an aspiring actress who has disappointed her scholarly mother by flatly refusing to go to college. (Kristen Stewart who I think by now has earned the right to leave Twilight associations in her past is perfect as the rebellious and cranky prodigal daughter.) No movie that kicks off with a diagnosis of Alzheimers is going to have what youd call a happy ending but some late scenes between Moore and Stewart capture the way the disease in stripping away the person you thought you knew can reveal someone new and precious underneath. Near the end Stewarts Lydia preparing for an audition reads her mother a long lyrical passage from Tony Kushners play Angels in America. ""What do you think that was about Mom?"" she cant resist asking in an attempt to get inside her mothers increasingly foggy head. Alice takes a moment to find the word but when she comes up with one its le mot juste ""love."" Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

"Review Alice powerfully presents a mind crumbling to Alzheimers - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Still Alice powerfully presents a mind falling to Alzheimers Still Alice Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Still Alice Starring Julianne Moore Kate Bosworth Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Still Alice Starring Julianne Moore Kate Bosworth Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Brutally honest performances in Still Alice drive home the horror of a loved one being stolen by Alzheimers Losing your mind is a terrible thing to watch but the splendid acting in ""Still Alice"" makes it worth the pain. Scarier than any Elm Street nightmare a horror film for the rest of us it succeeds despite itself not because of one strong performance but two.The accomplished Julianne Moore stars as respected academic Alice Howland shocked by her diagnosis of early onset Alzheimers disease and the actress work as someone coping with the ravages of the unthinkable deserves all the plaudits its going to get. But if it wasnt for costar Kristen Stewart who plays Alices daughter Lydia ""Still Alice"" wouldnt be nearly as emotionally effective as it is. Moore and Stewart have been off-screen friends for more than a decade and that bond only enhances the work they do here.As scripted by the writer-director team of Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland from a novel by Lisa Genova ""Still Alice"" does have obstacles to overcome. Elements of its plot have the standard quality of a Hallmark production and the work of some of the films costars is a bit too on the nose. But with Moore and Stewart on the case we feel the presence of something real here something that cant be shrugged off or ignored. Alice is introduced at the usual cinematic happy event where no one realizes its going to be all downhill from here. It is the 50th birthday celebration for this celebrated Columbia University professor of linguistics with her loving if a trifle overbearing husband John (Alec Baldwin) and two of her three adult children (Kate Bosworth Hunter Parrish) present at a Manhattan restaurant to raise a glass. Timeline Kenneth Turans 54 favorite films Andrea Wang Andrea Wang Not attending is third daughter Lydia (Stewart) an aspiring actress who lives out in Los Angeles. Alice uses the opportunity of a speaking engagement at UCLA to look in on Lydia and to express clearly not for the first time her frustration that this daughter has chosen not to go to college in favor of following her passion.One pleasure of ""Still Alice"" at this early stage is the chance it gives us to see Moore playing a happy well-adjusted woman. The actress is so good at aberrational characters -- her unhinged Havana Segrand in David Cronenbergs forthcoming ""Maps to the Stars"" is the latest example -- that we dont get enough chances to see her playing normal yet still involving which is nowhere near as easy as it may sound. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link But ""Still Alice"" is not about staying normal to the last frame. Like viewers of ""Titanic"" who know that the ship is destined to sink without a trace we wait for that first indication -- it turns out to be a memory lapse at that UCLA talk -- of the decline we know is inevitable. Alice shrugs that one off but back home in New York things get worse and when she finds herself disoriented jogging near her home a visit to a neurologist is unavoidable.The eventual diagnosis is as shocking as it is incontrovertible with this being a hereditary condition Alice might have passed on to her children making things only worse. The heart of ""Still Alice"" is the wrenching business of watching as all the things that define this woman to herself and her family gradually drain away one by one by one.Moore is especially good at the wordless elements of this transformation allowing us to see through the changing contours of her face what it is like when your mind empties out. When Alice says at one point ""I feel like I cant find myself"" it is all the more upsetting because weve already watched it happen.""Still Alice"" does have situations that feel contrived and overly familiar like an all-but-preordained heart-to-heart talk by the ocean which is why the film is especially fortunate to have not only Moore but Stewart to keep things honest.As she demonstrated working with Juliette Binoche in Olivier Assayas Cannes favorite ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" Stewart is especially good at going toe to toe and holding her own with veteran actresses and the intensity she brings to the part of a daughter determined to do things her own way is essential here.Finally though it doesnt say so in so many words ""Still Alice"" wants you to remember that its title is only one letter off from ""Still Alive."" Alice is struggling to be who she once was and that is a battle we have to respect no matter what.Twitter KennethTuran------------------------------------""Still Alice""MPAA rating PG-13 for mature thematic material and brief language including a sexual reference.Running time 1 hour 39 minutesPlaying At Landmark West Los Angeles Sundance Sunset West Hollywood Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Kristen Stewart Julianne Moore Alzheimers Disease UCLA Julianne Moore works to find the person inside the struggle Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-still-alice-movie-review-20141205-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,stillalice26,stillalice,latimes

Thats saying something given her array of impressive roles including a bored housewife in Far from Heaven a lesbian mom in The Kids Are All Right and a porn star in Boogie Nights.Her performance powerfully captures the growing confusion caused by the debilitating illness. At first Alice dismisses her random acts of forgetfulness as middle-aged memory malaise. Then she panics when on her daily run she becomes disoriented. The world looks hazy and unfamiliar as Alice struggles to find her way home.Shortly afterward she is diagnosed with a rare hereditary form of Alzheimers. Her husband John (Alec Baldwin) and three grown children respond in unexpected ways as her composed capable persona begins to slip away.Told in linear style the drama focuses on Alices emotional reaction to the diagnosis even more than it does on the vicissitudes of the illness. Its a deeply intimate saga that lays bare Alices struggles.As a linguistics professor at Columbia University in New York Alices stock in trade is words. Her fascination with them remains even after her memory loss is apparent. Her specialty was language acquisition and the audience watches as her own words begin to slip away.The progress of her disease and its acceleration are captured deftly as we witness her changing world through her eyes. Moores facial expressions convey her mounting agitation. Images are distorted effectively and sound is amplified to make it all the more terrifying.Technology plays an intriguing part in her tale not just the word games she plays on her smartphone but also in the daily questions she poses to herself and answers on her phone. She clings to her shrinking gray matter in a way that is both understandable and heartbreaking.Some plot points feel contrived and a few supporting parts particularly her older daughter Anna (Kate Bosworth) dont ring as true as Moores.But Kristen Stewarts performance as Lydia Alices black-sheep daughter is one of her best. She evolves from self-absorbed to the most caring and tenderhearted of Alices children.While other Alzheimers-related films including Amour Iris and Away from Her delved more deeply into the subject Alice is understated yet still moving. 124 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1zVfyVV,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/12/04/still-alice-review/19775511/,200,stillalice27,stillalice,usatoday

Its what it subtracts. Things you could once do without care you now cant do without struggle (if you can do them at all). Skills habits pleasures begin to slip away like ice in the sun. And with them goes a part of you. Until you have to wonder -- how much more of ""you"" can you lose and still be who you are? ""Still Alice"" asks that question by focusing -- with a gaze both tearful and unblinking -- on a single woman Alice played by Julianne Moore. She has the perfect Manhattan life -- she and her husband are both professors at Columbia they have three smart adult children a Long Island beach house and a rambling New York brownstone. Shes just turned 50 and she looks great. And then starting to forget things she sees her neurologist and gets a diagnosis Early-onset Alzheimers. Directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland dont even show the doctor during that early pivotal scene keeping the camera exclusively on Moore. We watch as many emotions -- mostly denial and disbelief -- play out across her pale and luminous face. She is a professor of linguistics. And now her mind -- her language -- is being taken from her? ""I wish I had cancer"" she tells her husband later and we know exactly what she means. But ""Still Alice"" also shows us step by awful step. We see her suddenly getting lost during a jog; and then even more frighteningly in her own home. We watch her at first struggling to play Words With Friends; and then horrifyingly fighting to remember her own children. This is what this disease does to you coming like a thief in the night stealing bits of your self. Moore has been a fine actress for a long time and ""Still Alice"" gives her a remarkable role and the space to truly live it. It softens things at times -- she only becomes truly angry once and mostly sinks into a vague smiling fog -- but nothing she does feels fake or forced. It is a terrific performance and nothing distracts from it. Not the subdued supporting cast (including a restrained Alec Baldwin as her supportive husband and Kristen Stewart as a black-sheep daughter). Not the camerawork either which only occasionally uses an obvious trick or two -- like a shallow depth of field which turns Alice or her surroundings into a blur -- to make its points. And this is the films point That Alice is not her disease. That -- even robbed of language of memories of all but the simplest thoughts -- Alice still remains Alice. It may be an overly optimistic point of view. It certainly may not be one you agree with. But it is one that many people cling to out of hope or necessity. And in the cruelest coincidence of all so must co-director Richard Glatzer; just before beginning preproduction on the film he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrigs disease. The prognosis is as cruel as it always is and the progression of the disease has been rapid over the several years it took to make this movie. Yet even with all that Glatzer still made the movie. Even with all of this he is still Richard. Ratings note The film contains strong language. Still Alice (PG-13) Sony Pictures Classics (99 min.) Directed by Richard Glatzer Wash Westmoreland. With Julianne Moore Alec Baldwin Kristen Stewart.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Though shot in the stolidly inconspicuous style of a low-rated cable drama Still Alice is rarely anything short of compelling in part because its sense of progression and scale offers such a distinctively unsentimental take on the terminal-countdown tearjerker. The title character (Julianne Moore) is a linguistics professor slowly dissolving into the haze of early-onset Alzheimers dogged by guilt over having passed her rare form of the disease on to her three grown children. Her world shrinks and shrinks and shrinks until its reduced to a corner of the living room and whatever fleeting moments of connection she might have with the people she only occasionally recognizes as her family. Rarely letting on how much time is slipping by between scenes writer-directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland (Quinceanera The Last Of Robin Hood) frame the movie around routines and repetitions. Alice jogs every day around the Columbia campus until she doesnt; she goes for walks on her own until she cant; shes able to make her own way around the house until she pisses herself looking for the bathroom. It sounds rigidly schematic but isnt because instead of foregrounding structure Glatzer and Westmoreland focus on Moores nuanced performance--never more clearly than in the long locked-in close-up that covers her first visit to the doctor--and on her characters changing relationships with her husband her children and to her own sense of self.Parenthood aging marriage a work-life balance--these are common grown-up anxieties which the movie magnifies using Alices disease as a kind of catalytic agent. (Its no coincidence that the film opens on her 50th birthday with her condition still undiagnosed but already showing its symptoms.) She isnt an easy person to begin with; she can be overbearing and bullheaded and she makes no secret of her disappointment in her youngest daughter Lydia (Kristen Stewart) who has moved out to L.A. to try to make it as an actor. Her marriage to John (Alec Baldwin) is built on mutual values of independence; both have committed to their academic careers and he refuses to put his on hold.What these relationships and anxieties have in common is that theyre all motivated by expectations about the future. As Alices condition worsens the future recedes disappearing even more quickly than the past. In many ways Still Alices big subject is the issue of what gets left behind when all the things that define a person--past future independence--crumble away. Its title might as well have a question mark at the end of it.

A professor faces early-onset Alzheimers. Directors Richard Glatzer Wash Westmoreland (141). PG-13 Mature themes language. Lincoln Square Angelika. Its amazing how casting can transform a film. ""Still Alice"" is hampered by both an unimaginative script and ordinary direction but its a serious Oscar contender. Why? Because Julianne Moore is in the lead. Moores deeply empathetic performance grounds this straightforward drama about a woman undone by a cruel trick of fate (or at least genetics). She plays Alice an acclaimed linguistics professor at Columbia. Brilliant wealthy beloved by her family and respected by her colleagues she seems to have everything. And then she finds herself losing all of it. First she merely misplaces her keys and forgets names. But eventually she and her scientist husband (Alec Baldwin) are forced to accept the cruel truth She has inherited a rare case of early-onset Alzheimers disease. As her oldest daughter (Kate Bosworth) calculates the practical consequences her youngest (Kristen Stewart) deals with the emotional fallout. Bosworth turns in a strong supporting turn but Stewart is miscast as Moores daughter and Baldwin seems oddly disengaged. Perhaps thats because he realizes how limited the films scope is In adapting Lisa Genovas novel writer-directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland focus on Alices travails with single-minded determination. They are unwavering in their compassion but unwilling to expand beyond a tone of earnest respect. This puts a heavy burden on Moores shoulders The entire movie really is about her performance. She vigorously embraces the challenge and delivers a wrenching portrait that you wont soon forget. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews still alice alec baldwin kate bosworth kristen stewart Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Still Alice adapted by married couple Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland from Lisa Genovas 2007 novel of the same name is the rare film possessed with the courage required to shine a light into that abyss knowing full well that down is the only way out. For illustrious Columbia University linguistics professor Dr. Alice Howland (an astonishingly controlled Julianne Moore whose career-best performance lacks so much as a hint of stagy artifice) the first symptoms are subtly ominous. Just 50 years old Alice is too young to assume that a momentary lapse might be an early sign of dementia. And then over the length of a single devastating close-up Alice learns that the rest of her life will be devoted to what she later refers to as ""the art of losing."" After that bombshell diagnosis theres only one direction in which Still Alice can go and the film directly confronts the inevitability of its story. Profoundly moving but never exploitative the script homes in on the mundane exchanges that form the foundation of our closest relationships--the particulars of a Pinkberry order the shorthand of a text the delay before a hug--and demolishes that bedrock in a series of masterfully precise explosions. Perhaps owing to the fact that Glatzer and Westmoreland know a thing or two about living with a debilitating disease (the former has ALS) the movie always evinces an acute understanding of how pity can be the most painful thing to feel for someone you love. Even the scripts more suspect choices like a perpetual game of Words with Friends shared between Alice and her oldest daughter (Kate Bosworth) become avenues for the kind of shattering details that make each case of Alzheimers its own struggle. Most resonant of all is the strained relationship between Alice and her actor daughter (Kristen Stewart continuing to defy expectations) which is imbued with new tenderness when Alices marriage to her husband (Alec Baldwin) begins to deteriorate at the same pace as her mind. While Still Alice provides glimpses of Stewart performing plays by Anton Chekhov and Tony Kushner the theatricality of those scenes illuminates the delicate visual style with which Glatzer and Westmoreland imbue the others. Relying on subtle uses of shallow focus and takes that run long enough for Alice to forget how they began the story is told with such a damaged grace that it could be seen as a neurological snuff film if not for the unyielding empathy for its characters that ultimately makes it such a rewarding experience. As tough as it is to watch (I think I cried more during these 99 minutes than I ever have in my life--cumulatively) Still Alice resolves as a beautiful illustration of why the art of losing should never be taken for granted.

Like the way A.L.S. is revealed and examined without buckets of tears in The Theory of Everything Julianne Moore in the heartbreaking Still Alice follows the arc of a devastating illness without pulling out the stops and torturing you with self-pity. This time the disease is the mysterious Alzheimers and thanks to this brave and gutsy actress overwhelming candor and sincerity you go away feeling educated enlightened and more compassionate than you can possibly imagine. STILL ALICE  (4/4 stars) Written and directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland Starring Julianne Moore Kirsten Stewart and Kate Bosworth Running time 99 min. The always startling actress is no stranger to forays into the dark side but this time shes as real and as normal as inhaling playing Dr. Alice Howland a 50-year-old distinguished professor of linguistics at Columbia a well adjusted happily married professional with a successful husband and three grown children. When she is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers after her mind goes blank in the middle of a guest lecture at UCLA shes shocked then shattered. Shes too young for this. Alzheimers is a disease for senior citizens right? Her blood tests are fine but her memory losses are worrying and the profile fits. Determined to continue her research and lifestyle uninterrupted with the full support of her husband (Alec Baldwin in one of his more sensitive and totally natural performances) and family Alice eschews the terror of what lies ahead and embraces logic and common sense. Gradually subtle changes do creep in she loses her sense of direction during a routine jog through Central Park forgets her keys cant find the bathroom in her own house. Secretly she stores up pills for the inevitable time when her condition gets hopeless. Every study of Alzheimers is different but the saddest aspect of her particular case is that Alice has always been a woman defined by words and suddenly she cant remember any. The more the affliction increases the more engrossing the film becomes. Coping becomes the function of a once privileged and orderly life and panic sets in over something as simple as tying a shoelace or misplacing a cell phone. Alices cloudless marriage is put to the test like an examination final her job is terminated and her children react in touching and disturbing ways especially when they all discover her rare form of the disease can be passed on genetically and her married daughter is having a baby. Struggling to hold on to whats left of herself live in the moment hold onto her sense of humor and still stay connected to the facts without losing control of the Alice she has always known becomes an unexpected daily goal. Ms. Moore shares her journey with boundless generosity. She makes you feel what its like to lose the wind beneath your wings. The talented writing-directing team of Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland who last year guided Kevin Kline through one of his greatest roles in the sturdy fascinating and underrated Errol Flynn biopic The Last of Robin Hood have a special rapport with actors. The effects of Alzheimers have been explored before most notably by Julie Christie Gena Rowlands Joanne Woodward and Mia Farrow. The radiant Ms. Moore proves their equal. In the end the two directors have extracted a nuanced and sensitively embroidered performance that is inventive without the slightest hint of contrivance. Through immeasurable loss she shows how life can be sustained if we can only learn the value of negotiating our priorities and weighing our limitations until love is all that matters. Its a hell of a lesson in one hell of a motion picture.

The toll the disease takes on the life of a brilliant linguistics professor is superbly detailed by Julianne Moore in a career-high performance driving straight to the terror of the disease and its power to wipe out personal certainties and identity. Written and directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland the screenplay is faithful to Lisa Genovas best-selling novel which has a fan base of its own. Rather than focus on the destructive effect of the disease on relationships the drama dives deep into how one woman experiences her own deteriorating condition placing all the emphasis on Moores face and reactions her vulnerability seesawing with her strength. This insiders account would be a tall order for any actor to fill without resorting to sentimentality or falling into the obvious but she never loses control of the film for a second with able support from Kristen Stewart Alec Baldwin Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish as family members. The involvement of the Alzheimers Association and executive producing names like Christine Vachon Maria Shriver and Trudie Styler will offer an additional leg up although word of mouth should provide the strongest incentive for audiences leery of the topic. Alice Howland (Moore) is a vivacious charming 50-year-old New Yorker -- a respected intellectual who is a precision communicator. Her loving husband John (Baldwin) calls her the smartest most beautiful woman hes ever met and their three grown children -- Anna (Bosworth) Tom (Parrish) and aspiring actress Lydia (Stewart) -- are if not success stories at least making their way in life. Alice has it all -- until she begins to forget words which are her livelihood as a Columbia linguistics teacher and worse starts to lose her bearings in familiar places. Shes frightened enough to consult a neurologist who rules out a brain tumor but hypothesizes early-onset Alzheimers a rare form of the disease that strikes people under 65. Alices first reaction is to hide it but after getting confused about a dinner guest she makes her husband privy to her fears. As her doctor tells them bluntly her disease is genetic and the chances of their children contracting it are 50 percent. It falls on the family like a bomb especially when one of the kids tests positive for the rogue gene. But this bad news is quickly sidelined by Alices own mental decline as the disease makes terrible swift progress. While her family tries to cope with the situation or miserably fails to do so the casts ensemble performance brings out their true colors including some surprising role changes. Despite a two-hour running time the drama is swift-moving perhaps because the viewer dreads the diseases progression and wishes time would stop for poor Alice. But it doesnt stop and step by step she descends the cognitive ladder not suffering so much as struggling to stay connected. In one standout scene she stumbles onto suicide instructions she has left for herself on her computer. Though this is one of the films most intense scenes the directors are able to slip in a moments humor to lighten things up. Not all is doom and gloom here. Another key scene has Alice invited to address an Alzheimers conference. Her anxious preparations end in a triumphant monologue about her condition that is truly touching. Westmoreland and Glatzer have created drama around the porn industry (The Fluffer) the Mexican community in Los Angeles (Quinceanera) and Errol Flynns last fling with a teenage girl (The Last of Robin Hood.) Still Alice has a concentration and urgency in the telling that the other films lack. Although not known for daring cinematic fireworks or experimentation the directors tackle a subject where a restrained understated approach is the best insurance against sloppy sentimentality. It pays off handsomely in the films closing moments a poignant poetic confrontation between the generations that draws the best from Moore and reveals unexpected depth in Stewart. The films extremely personal feeling is surely related to the fact that Glatzer directed it while undergoing a health crisis of his own -- after being diagnosed with ALS he had to co-direct the movie on an iPad using a text-to-speech app. Tech work remains humbly in the background all in the service of keeping the spotlight focused on Moore and mimicking her feelings with an out-of-focus camera costumes she no longer chooses herself and so on.

When the movies deal with Alzheimers they nearly always approach it from the vantage of the family members who are painfully forgotten as loved ones lose their memories. ""Still Alice"" shows the process from the victims p.o.v. and suddenly the disease isnt just something sad that happens to other people but a condition we can relate to firsthand. Julianne Moore guides us through the tragic arc of how it must feel to disappear before ones own eyes accomplishing one of her most powerful performances by underplaying the scenario -- a low-key approach that should serve this dignified indie well in limited release. Based on the novel by neuroscientist Lisa Genova ""Still Alice"" gives new meaning to the phrase ""It happens to the best of us."" Columbia professor Alice Howland is the sort of character who even without Alzheimers to contend with is accomplished and interesting enough to warrant her own movie. She has achieved much in her 50-odd years both as a respected scholar and mother of three grown children played by Kristen Stewart Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish. For the otherwise healthy Alice theres no good reason why Alzheimers should strike now nearly 15 years before it traditionally occurs although as her doctor points out the condition can actually be harder to diagnose in intelligent people since theyre capable of devising elaborate work-arounds that mask the problem. Genovas book hit especially close to home for husband-and-husband helmers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland (""Quinceanera"") since Glatzer suffers from ALS -- another degenerative condition that systematically attacks ones sense of self. At first its just a word that goes missing in the middle of one of Alices linguistics lectures. But the situation gets scarier when she loses track of where she is during her daily jog. Since Alices disease involves short-term memory loss a number of the tests she faces are ones the audience can take alongside with the inevitable result that we start to reflect on the blind spots in our memory. Forgetting things isnt unusual even among perfectly healthy adults making it easy to identify with Moore who plays her initial concerns quite casually. Its not until Alice learns that the disease is hereditary that the severity of her situation sets in As if it werent bad enough that she will eventually cease to recognize her own children Alice may also be responsible for passing the condition along to them. This is a tragedy pure and simple and yet the directing duo refuses to milk the familys situation for easy tears. Instead the idea is to put us inside Alices head. We experience disorientation as she would suggested by a shallow depth of field where things shown out of focus appear to be just beyond her comprehension. Alices diagnosis calls for a form of grieving during which she tries coming to terms with the fact that life as it had previously existed is now over. She tells the department chair at Columbia U. where she taught about her Alzheimers and is promptly dismissed from her position. She gets lost in her own home and is easily overwhelmed whenever she steps out of it. Though her husband John (Alec Balwin) aims to be supportive he refuses to let her condition derail his own professional life. Alice begs him to take a year off work so they can be together before shes too far gone to experience her own life making visits to retirement homes and making contingency plans (a bottle of sleeping pills stashed at the back of a dresser drawer) for the day when she can no longer answer a series of personal questions about her life. The directorial couple must have gone through something very similar when Glatzers ALS kicked in forcing him to accept that his body had become his greatest enemy. The pair bring that personal connection to the writing process emphasizing Alices emotions over those of her various family members -- although Stewart whose character steps in as caregiver at one point gets several intimate unshowy scenes with Moore. The helmers have made a conscious decision to keep things quiet commissioning a score from British composer Ilan Eshkeri that doesnt tell you how to feel but rather how she feels lost emotional and anxious most of the time. Clearly Glatzer has not yet given up and neither does Alice despite her relatively rapid degeneration. Its a devastating thing to watch the light of recognition dwindle in her eyes to see the assertive confident lecturer that she had so recently been reduced to the nervous scared woman we see delivering one last speech at an Alzheimers society confab. After the stiff lifelessness of ""The Last of Robin Hood"" the helmers have made a near-total recovery shooting things in such a way that activity is constantly spilling beyond the edges of the frame giving the impression that characters lives continue when theyre not on camera even as Alices seems to be closing in around her. Just as her kids look for ever-fainter signs of their mother behind those eyes we lean in to watch Moore the actress turn invisible within her own skin.

Chris says May 12 2015 at 809 am 2/22/15 comment ""Vic"" hit the Fluoride/Aluminum/Alzheimers nail on the head. A great movie but they dont address why? The USA spends more money on disease care than anywhere on the planet yet theyre the sickest in the world. Fluoride Genetically Engineered food 80000 carcenogenic chemicals in products and the food supply. The typical response of ""Its Genetic"" is correct but the chemicals and toxins are whats wreaking havoc on DNA to do so. Reply Vic says February 22 2015 at 917 pm I just wanted to shed light on a disturbing connection the medical/scientific community is now making between fluoride and Alzheimers disease. Studies suggest that ingestion of low doses of fluoride increases the absorption of aluminum which as most of you know is implicated in neural degeneration such as dementia and Alzheimers. And about 75% of Americans water contains this highly toxic substance as it is added by public water treatment plants. Almost no media or political attention is given to this issue though 97% of Europe has now banned the practice of fluoridation (or never began it in the first place) and it has officially been classified as a neurotoxin by Harvard and Lancet Neurology. Please educate your friends and family. And on a lighter note phenomenal movie. Reply Michelle says February 22 2015 at 456 pm The movie brings attention to this horrific disease. The movie was good yet somewhat antiseptic. Having cared for a loved one with Alzheimer""s the scene at the end of the movie is the reality of the disease just beginning to kick in. It begins with memory loss but thats the easier part. This disease is a steady systematic decomposition of the brain while the person is alive. Every single body system is affected. Yet I have first hand knowledge that the person is still in there even at the very end. As my loved one communicated through body language; and may not have remembered my name but knew a loved one was there for her. Although I wish I was more knowledgeable to help her more. Most people just write victims of this disease off in the last stages just thinking theres no one left in there. Victims may moan yet are in there and need your compassion more than ever. If youre a care giver educate yourself. The line from the movie ""I wish I had cancer instead."" is so true. Cancer elicits sympathy and at least theres a chance for remission. Not so with Alzheimers. Alzheimers is socially isolating; and once it takes hold theres no stopping it. Lets all support scientific research to eradicate such a dreadful disease Reply John says February 16 2015 at 728 pm I just finished watching this very sad inspirational story. The movie was quite an eye opener of a victim of Alzheimers. It also projects a great example of the heartfelt upset of all who loved this person. Bravo Julianne Moore and Alec Baldwin. I believe an Academy Award will be in order. Reply peg malone says January 24 2015 at 855 am when will still alice be released in albanyn.y.? Reply bretiscool2014 says November 30 2014 at 1132 am Reblogged this on Alzheimers Disease. Reply SAM says September 24 2014 at 409 am I cannot wait to see this film I cared for my mother for 10+ years with Alzheimers until her last moments at age 85. It was hard but we had many wonderful times too. The really h a r d thing is watching my sister diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimers at age 60 decline so rapidly. She has been actively supporting the the research to fight this devastating disease since our father was diagnosed with Early Onset in 1984 amp; passed away in 1992. Now she soon will be relieved of her suffering and we will miss her very much but where will it strike next? Reply John Caro says September 24 2014 at 1227 pm If the movie is half as good as the book it will be a hit. From your post it sounds like you are worried about getting it yourself.I have worked with dementia patients for over ten years now and I can tell you that fear speeds the course of the disease while a sense of humor slows it. Find something that makes you laugh out loud I watch The Daily Showor Bill Maher. Old Marx brothers movies are good too. The important thing is to let go of your fear and learn to laugh again. You will be much happier. Reply sparky says February 15 2015 at 430 pm Where is your references to back up your claims that worrying about it speeds up the disease while humor slows it? I think thats incorrect. If the film is correct if you have early onset alzheimers it is rapid onset with no drugs to slow it down. It might be poosible to slow down other forms of the disease with drugs but imo humor wont help. If Im wrong site your reputible references. Nola Ruppard says September 14 2014 at 828 pm I Care for my friend of 32 years who was diagnosed 7 years ago. At 92 she is still going strong following a compression fracture of her spine last Autumn and a fractured hip then a fractured pelvis (in 4 places). Her memory issue has helped her endure the pain and I have two other women who also help with her care. The disease is sometimes almost unbearable to deal with but most of the time she is so delightful to be with that I forget she has Alzheimers. Reply John Caro says February 15 2015 at 848 pm I suggest you read ""Anatomy of An Illness"" by Norman Cousins. I was diagnosed with early onset AD when I was 48 it turned out to be a tumor but I made a study of AD and became a caregiver for dementia patients. I am a licensed massage therapist with special training in elder and Alzheimers care. I see the effects of humor on my clients everyday. When a person is first diagnosed they often become depressed and then the disease moves very quickly if they can find a way to laugh the hormones released boost their immune system and AD is greatly slowed. Each case is different but all cases are helped by a good laugh. I wrote a book for new patients. You can find it on Amazon. Reply John Caro says September 14 2014 at 1037 pm Living in the moment frees you from the past. Reply Cathy says September 12 2014 at 644 pm My husband was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers at age 53. I also read and loved the book Still Alice. Although Alices disease progresses at an extremely rapid rate my husband and our family are experiencing many of the same challenges albeit at a much slower progression. We are 7 years into this nightmare with no clue how long we have yet to go. Cant wait for the movie to come to my theater. My prayers to all persons and their families stricken with this horrible disease. Reply Sunny Holloway says September 12 2014 at 824 am Read the book years back as my sister had Alzheimers for 5 years till her death. Its devastating to listen to someone who can remember things from 60+ years ago but doesnt know whether or not she had breakfast that very day. I shared Alices story with my Reading Group and intend to copy this film information for them (20 women) as well. Cant wait to see the movie as the book was not only helpful and informative but really GREAT. .. Reply Dorothy Cosenza says September 11 2014 at 1109 am The movie Still Alice sounds excellent. There is no date marked as to when this movie will be showing. Would someone please let us know? Reply shirley almeida says September 11 2014 at 1045 am LOVED THE BOOK AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IT. Reply SKDogLover says September 11 2014 at 1037 am Sadly like so many others Alzheimers has affected my family. I read the book but not until recently and am not sure I will not be able to sit through the movie without bawling my eyes out. Mom has been gone for six years her sister died from it seven yrs ago...and both maternal grandparents had what was only referred to then as dementia (they passed decades ago). It is simply a devastating disease. Or course I worry if I am going to get it - so do my siblings and cousins. I would like to encourage EVERYONE to participate in any clinical trials - getting people to participate has been difficult for researchers. I myself will be signing up for the A4Study when I turn 65. Without research there will be no cure. Reply John Caro says September 11 2014 at 1036 am I was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers when I was 48. An MRI showed a massive brain tumor that was causing my symptoms. The tumor was removed 17 years ago but it was so large[more than one pound] that I still have severe memory loss. I looked for a book for patients but all I could find were books for caregivers. Then I found ""STILL ALICE"" it is the closest description of the experience I have found. Anyone who wants to know what it is like to develop dementia should read it. You can find it on ebay. Reply Gary Bricker says September 10 2014 at 808 pm I have been diagnosed with ""early onset"" Alzheimers. I am 65 and have had it for a few years now. I am fortunate to have a lovely caring wife who is my care partner. According to the Alzheimers Assoc. one American ""gets"" Alzheimers every 67 seconds It has been found in people in their 30s and even earlier ages. I used to be a high functioning transactional ""transactional"" real estate attorney (I never sued anyone - and have only been in a courtroom as a witness - so I considered myself ""one of the good guys""). I lost 2 jobs in 3 years in that roll with companies that had a lot of real estate needs. This disease is going to decimate the Baby Boomer generation My wife and I have started a non-profit company to help create awareness - see it at AlzAcrossAmerica.org Reply SUSAN ELDON says September 10 2014 at 525 pm I cannot wait to see this film. Why? Because I watched my own mother disappear before my eyes slowly over the last 5 years as I was her main caretaker. More people need to see this disease and understand how devastating it is not only for the person afflicted with this horrible disease but also to the caregiver and the family. To make matters worse the caregiver then worries if they will also be afflicted with this disease. More and more baby boomers are caring for their parents and soon some of those caretakers will need their children to eventually care for them too.... and the cycle continues. I hope all reading this truly understands how important it is for EVERYONE to be more educated on Alzheimers as well as all forms of dementia as it will soon enough touch everyones life. Reply Tricia Adams says September 10 2014 at 522 pm When is this film going to be showing in the U.S.? Will it be a limited release here too? I am a caregiver for the elderly and have taken care of several people who have ALZ at all stages and worked on helping their families get through it etc. ""Still Alice"" is one of the best books Ive ever read. It touched something inside of me in a special way and I think in some ways made me a better caregiver. I am so excited that this book has been made into a movie. I am always recommending this book to people to read. The one I had has been passed around to several people and hopefully still is So many people dont understand just what ALZ is and getting the word out will help move things forward to finding a cure. Reply Valerie says September 10 2014 at 218 pm When does this movie release in the U.S.? My mother passed away from Alzheimers last November and my sisters and I all read this book a few years back. Alice reminded me so much of my mother who was a professor her whole career only to lose her prized intellect to this terrible disease. This movie has a great cast and I hope it does well at the box office as the general public has minimal understanding of how devastating this disease can be particularly in early onset. Awareness is the first step towards a cure Reply Dede says September 10 2014 at 1237 pm I loved this book I cried thru all of it My Mom has Alzheimers and the book hit home in so many ways I cannot wait for the movie [?][?] Reply Pati Hoffman says September 10 2014 at 1134 am I had the honor of doing an interview with Julianne Moore when she began gathering information for this movie. I was in my early 50s and it was a shock. The interview was an honor for me and I am sure it will be a fantastic movie Thank you so much for reaching out to Early Onset Alzheimers  Reply anniekautz says September 10 2014 at 1120 am I have watched my Grandmother Mother in Law Father and currently my Mother suffer from the ravages of Alzheimers and it never gets any easier but I understand much better now how to get through each stage of this terrible disease without losing my self. My Aunt now has the disease (all on my maternal side) so it seems as if I may be doomed but at least my husband and my children have all experienced the symptoms and signs first hand so they will be able to help much more than if they had no clue. This will be a movie I definitely would like to see. Reply LooksGood says September 9 2014 at 235 pm I almost started crying reading the review -- but I like movies like this indies (amp; foreign language) films where you learn something about people and places you dont know and havent been. Theyre good and good for your mind and soul in a way blockbusters can never be. Im in but consider myself warned will bring tissues. Thank you. Reply Gayle Horton says September 9 2014 at 233 pm I am a Geriatric Nurse Care Manager and the book ""Still Alice"" helped me to have deeper insight regarding the person dealing with the disease. I will never forget the section about support groups and Alice wanted to have her own support group. As a society we discount the patients feelings. As I visit my clients who have Alzheimers disease I know that there is a real person still inside. Reply Opal Tipton says September 9 2014 at 816 am My husband has Alzheimers. I read the book. At first it was so depressing to me as his caregiver. A good friend encouraged me to read it through and Im so glad I did. Its so true to form in what a person with Alzheimers goes through Ive gone through almost everything maybe more than what this book entailed with my husband. Its hard to believe it was a book of fiction and not fact Because to me......it was fact Ive been waiting patiently for this movie to come out I think its going to have such an impact on the community at large. People simply think that its a disease of simple memory loss Or even the cognitive loss Believe me its so much more Until you go through it personally.....you dont have a clue Hopefully it will be a wake up call Reply Beth Reinert says September 9 2014 at 505 am Lisa Genova depicted the family dynamics of an AD diagnosis brilliantly. Her impressive research and own family experience with the disease is evident in her book ""Still Alice"". Its an honor to have her represent the dementia community. Reply mm says September 9 2014 at 113 am I loved the book. It put a scare in me thinking of what could happen to my parents or even me. I hope the movie lives up to the great book. Reply terry says September 10 2014 at 218 pm I read the book 4 years ago - when my wife was first diagnosed with the disease. She is now 58 years old and almost in stage 7 of the disease. I cannot describe the grief this has caused to our children - 35 and 27 years old - and to her mother who is now 80. I will not watch the movie ever because I live this nightmare every day. Her younger sister talks to me almost daily. The effect on families is HUGE. It has irrevocably changed my life. There will be cure for this someday - too late for her sadly. If any reader is starting on this journey seek the love of friends and family - it is the only thing that will see you through it. Reply Opal Tipton says September 10 2014 at 306 pm Im so sorry about your wife Terry. My husband was diagnosed 4 years ago also. I just pray that you and your children get through this journey. I fully understand living the nightmare. I cant even attend a support group as my husband doesnt want me out of his sight. Im sure hes in the 6th stage going to the 7th. Its nothing Id wish on my worst enemy. And youre so right The love of family and friends and your relationship with God that gets you through. And dad to say were not through yet. Blessings to you and your family...... Frederick Louis Richardson says September 10 2014 at 109 pm However unfortunate no movie is ""the book"" and will never be reality. The most we can hope for is that the filmmakers has made a watchable entertainment that will eventually show a profit in this money-hungry filmmaking environment.
