By Anthony Lane Share Tweet Table of Contents Jon Favreau directs a remake of the 1967 Disney animated movie. Credit Illustration by Guillaume Plantevin For the first few moments Disneys new version of ""The Jungle Book"" looks and sounds like the old version from 1967. We move through a tropical forest darkly drawn to the accompaniment of plaintive music and then of a gentle voice which declares ""Many strange tales are told of this jungle."" Soon however the cartoon dissolves to make way for what seems like a real landscape. Hurtling through it is Mowgli (Neel Sethi) who scoots along tree branches in a jesting race with a wolf pack below. The camera is as giddy as the boy and if you are watching in 3-D or if you happen to be a wolf the creepers keep getting in your snout. The director is Jon Favreau a congenial figure who stopped the first two ""Iron Man"" films from rusting up. His main task in ""The Jungle Book"" is to show loyalty to the earlier movie a sacred spot to be furnished and burnished anew. The story stands much as it was with most of the familiar characters firmly in place. Mowgli the defenseless infant is adopted by a motherly wolf (voiced by Lupita Nyongo) overseen by Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) despised and hounded by Shere Khan (Idris Elba) all but seduced into the jaws of Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) and bullied by King Louie (Christopher Walken). Bill Murray obviously plays the bonhomous Baloo whose rendition of ""The Bare Necessities"" as he moseys downriver feels at once ragged and relaxed. So whats different? Well I miss George Sanders who played Shere Khan in 1967 but then I always miss George Sanders. Also without wishing to be cruel I would not shed copious tears if the latest Mowgli wound up as a protein snack for a passing carnivore. As for Louie whats extraordinary is that even as public attitudes have changed he hasnt. He still croons ""I Wanna Be Like You"" despite the deep racial unease that the song (and the whole scene) provoked; did executives really decide that its worth as a heritage item within the Disney brand exceeded all other demands? At any rate as if in compensation Louie has now expanded from your basic orangutan into a sort of tangerine Kong and a tiny sight gag has been tacked on to please any ""Apocalypse Now"" fans lurking in the stalls Louie scratches his scalp as a maundering Brando did in the near-dark. Not that Kurtzian madness poses any threat to Favreaus film which is largely as upbeat as its hero lacking nothing in scamper and pounce. Stick around for three reasons as the end credits roll. We get an amiable pangolin snuffling at the lens. We hear Johansson singing--or to be exact melodiously breathing--""Trust in Me"" which is not a commandment to be disobeyed. Third and last comes the bewildering line ""Filmed in downtown Los Angeles."" So much for the sights and scents of India. There is nothing wrong or unprecedented in such a sleight of hand; Josef von Sternberg and his muse Marlene Dietrich conjured up ""Morocco"" and ""Shanghai Express"" in the early nineteen-thirties without leaving the premises of Paramount. But Dietrich was real a dream made flesh whereas Bagheeras equally glossy exterior is no more than a virtual hide. The gods of computer generation have made every lupine hair every buffalo hoof and every scar on the ugly mug of Shere Khan who was once burned by mans ""red flower"" otherwise known as fire. To call the film an example of ""live action"" therefore is misleading; rather it is an imitation of life gazing at the world and crying out ""I wanna be like you."" The effect of this is first to astound us and then to leave us feeling curiously flat and unsatisfied. When no hint of risk or chance remains even in the leap of a single flame where does the drama--let alone the peril--reside? If the jungle becomes a laboratory how strong is the call of the wild? There is a residual sadness too in Favreaus movie because of an opportunity missed. Whether he chose not to revisit Kipling or was discouraged from doing so the original book (which is actually two books published in 1894 and 1895) has yet again been ignored. It is one of those works I suspect that people feel they know without having read a word but its unforgettable tone--lyrically crisp sense-heightening and sheared of surplus emotion--is like an antidote to Disney. The boys return to the human village on which both films so naggingly insist is dealt with by Kipling in a short closing chapter with Mowgli now almost seventeen passing ""hot hollows surrounded by wet rocks where he could hardly breathe for the heavy scents of the night flowers and the bloom along the creeper buds; dark avenues where the moonlight lay in belts as regular as checkered marbles in a church aisle."" Whether that dense and serious beauty will ever be captured on film I have no idea but its a far cry from the airy adventures that Disney has meted out in Kiplings name. Of the two attempts I still prefer the one from my childhood. The last animated feature that Walt Disney himself produced it was also a last hurrah for old-school methods designed by hand and to my innocent eyes verdant with charm and finesse. By contrast Favreaus ""Jungle Book"" while it feeds on the carrion of the earlier film is a model of current studio practice clean cleverly judged and hypercontrolled. It represents in short the state of the art. Without disputing that I would simply ask What art? It is hard to imagine Walt Disney enduring ""Tale of Tales."" He might perhaps have weathered the solemn queen (Salma Hayek) in black brocade who gnaws on a giant heart her cheeks agleam with gore. He would have laughed at the hapless king (Toby Jones) who tries to catch a hopping flea. But the other monarch (Vincent Cassel)--the one who wakes amid the jetsam of an orgy staggering through half-naked slumberers and seeking his next debauch--would have tipped poor Uncle Walt into a swoon. I doubt he would have stayed for the flaying. The film is directed by Matteo Garrone and adapted from a volume of fables that was published in the sixteen-thirties a century and a half before the Brothers Grimm were born. A Neapolitan courtier and poet named Giambattista Basile gathered the tales in a Neapolitan dialect under the memorable title of ""Lo Cunto de li Cunti."" (The philosopher Benedetto Croce produced a complete Italian translation in 1925.) Basiles harvest springs from demotic soil; though he wrote for a literate elite the dirt of an oral tradition clings to his telling rich in legend and slang. There are nearly fifty tales in all of which a mere three are picked out and woven through the film. Some viewers will find the weave too loose and its true that when the various protagonists assemble for a funeral march or at the climax for a coronation youre not quite sure how they are acquainted; do they dwell in adjacent kingdoms? Yet the brisk flourish of Garrones style is a force for unity. The singer binds the songs. At the start the unsmiling queen and her husband (John C. Reilly) yearning for a child are told to kill a sea monster and to have its heart cooked by a virgin. Two babies are subsequently born--one to the maiden one to the queen. They grow into identical boys with milk-white hair who enjoy the mischief of exchanging roles. As for the flea it is tenderly nurtured swelling to the size of a pig; after it dies its skin is hung up and suitors for the hand of the kings daughter (Bebe Cave) are invited to guess from what animal it came. The winner is an ogre who bears the princess off to his mountain lair. And so to the jaded orgiast who comes at last upon something that does not jade him the sound of a carolling voice--enough as he says to ""warm your cold king."" It belongs to one of two ugly sisters who reluctant to reveal their haggard selves pique his desire by proffering a single finger poked through a hole in a door to be caressed and sucked. Basile called his book an ""Entertainment for Little Ones"" but in this case they should probably stay away. Two things lend lustre to the movie allowing it to honor the rough magic that was mustered on the page. The first is a matter of texture as the sumptuous is played off against the earthen--in parallel you might say with the cast list of princes and paupers. Thus a pearl-encrusted ruff is paired with a mop of bedraggled hair. A torch flames gorgeously in a larder among the swaying carcasses of poultry and swine. One of the hags robed in royal bedclothes is tossed from a high window crashing into trees beneath and the camera lingers to survey the pictorial shock swags of crimson drapery worthy of Titian hang in the green and moss-furred dankness of a wood. Garrones second ploy is to insure that no one is surprised by these surprises. Where the eyes of a Disney princess grow wide as her pumpkin becomes a coach the folk in ""Tale of Tales"" accept that miracles happen being not an irruption into life but part of its natural flow. That is why the pale boys sired by a sea beast walk side by side underwater grinning as they go and why the final image is that of a tightrope on fire. Wonders are like dangers face them and you will pass the test.  Share Tweet Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

"Jungle Book The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jungle-book-the ) Jungle Book The (United States 2016) April 16 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli The process of transforming beloved animated classics into live-action versions has become a modern cottage industry. This self-cannibalization has included titles like Cinderella Snow White Sleeping Beauty and now The Jungle Book (with Beauty and the Beast waiting in the wings). To be sure The Jungle Book isnt a ""Disney property"" but the 1967 animated film is probably better known than Rudyard Kiplings source material and thats the edition Jon Favreau has turned to for inspiration. The kinship is close enough that three songs from the 49-year old film make ""cameos"" in the 2016 movie (although one is spoken not sung). Yes fans can get their ""Bare Necessities"" fix. The Jungle Book is well-made and deserves recognition as one of the years best family offerings (thus far). With its effective mix of dazzling visuals energetic action/adventure sequences and low-key humor this is as at least as good as the 1967 cartoon (which although beloved isnt representative of Disney in top form) and exceeds the pathetic 2003 sequel by a wide margin. Its also not quite as child-friendly as one might expect from a PG-rated movie. Sensitive movie-goers under the age of about 8 may find some of the animal-on-animal violence unsettling. The story focuses on the exploits of a ""man cub"" named Mowgli (Neel Sethi) who was raised in the Indian jungle by a tribe of wolves. He calls Raksha (voice of Lupita Nyongo) and Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) his parents even though theyre obviously of a different species. Although most of the other animals accept Mowgli theres one dissenter the tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) whose hatred for humans runs so deep that he wont accept anything less than Mowglis death. To promote his own survival Mowgli must make the journey to the nearest human habitation and ""turn himself in."" Along the way hes helped by friends like Bagheera the panther (Ben Kingsley) and Baloo the bear (Bill Murray) while others like Kaa the snake (Scarlett Johansson) and King Louie the gigantopithecus (Christopher Walken) are less kindly disposed toward his quest. Although we get snatches of ""The Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You"" The Jungle Book isnt a musical. Those songs exist primarily as homages to the 1967 movie and because especially in the case of ""The Bare Necessities"" viewers would complain about their absence. The sequences with Baloo provide some needed comedic relief. Parts of The Jungle Book are intense and Shere Khan is anything but loveable. There are enough lighthearted moments to keep The Jungle Book firmly in the family-friendly category but Justin Marks screenplay doesnt shy away from dark scenes and tragedy. The film is probably only a whiskers breadth from a PG-13 rating. Without dissecting the merits of the 3-D version (it neither adds to nor detracts from the overall experience but isnt as immersive as the marketing would have customers believe) I can say that The Jungle Book is a pleasure to watch. Favreau takes the time and effort to make the jungle into a vibrant varied environment. More impressively the four-legged inhabitants are rendered so realistically its almost impossible to accept that they were (for the most part) created on computers using motion capture techniques. The only traditional ""actor"" in The Jungle Book is newcomer Neel Sethi; everyone else is the product of CGI making this more of a hybrid production than a pure live-action endeavor. The voice actors are good choices across-the-board. Ben Kingsley brings the appropriate level of gravitas to the strait-laced Bagheera. Elements of Bill Murrays personality bleed through into Baloo. Idris Elba who is becoming one of Disneys go-to performers (Zootopia The Jungle Book and Finding Dory) uses his bass pipes to enhance Shere Khans forceful and frightening persona. Christopher Walkens King Louie is a more twisted interpretation of the character than weve previously encountered. And Scarlett Johansson lends a feminine serpentine touch to a mostly male-dominated cast. (This marks a reunion of sorts for her and Murray who were last together in Lost in Translation.) The Jungle Book has been strategically released at a time when the box office is pretty quiet so it should have no trouble filling seats. Although not the best live action reinterpretation of an animated film its good enough to make the time and effort to see especially for fans of the earlier version or the genre. This edition of The Jungle Book may not go down in history as a classic but kids (and maybe their parents) will love it all the same.

The studios 1967 animated classic was perhaps my favorite of all Disney films growing up and the updated version sounded like yet another in the series of cynical nostalgia-plying cash grabs that have so come to define contemporary Hollywood. Related Story Cinderella and the Virtues of Being Old-Fashioned But then I had presumed very much the same about Mad Max Fury Road and about Creed which turned out to be two of the most delightful cinematic surprises of last year. And like those movies--and to a somewhat more conflicted degree Star Wars The Force Awakens--The Jungle Book is proof that even the crassest commercial imperatives can be transcended when imbued with love and creativity. The Jungle Book may or may not be a nostalgia-plying cash grab. But regardless it is a genuinely wonderful film an almost overwhelming onrush of thrills wit and tenderness.The story is the familiar one--loosely adapted from Kiplings eponymous book of stories--of Mowgli the ""man-cub"" raised by wolves in the jungles of India. Threatened with death by the tiger Shere Khan Mowgli accompanied by his paternal panther Bagheera heads for a man village where he might be safe along the way encountering such notables as Kaa the python King Louie of the apes and of course Baloo the bear.But at every step the director Jon Favreau and the screenwriter Justin Marks have enriched the narrative deepened the themes and ratcheted the tension and emotion alike to unanticipated levels. Mowglis journey is now a much more vivid transition from cubhood toward autonomy his human ""tricks"" and tool-making cast in clearer contrast to the wildness of the jungle. Is there a place for him there or does he truly stand apart?Each of the animal principals moreover offer Mowgli a different path to follow. There is Bagheeras plan for civic safety and Baloos Arcadian escapism of course. But Kaa too (cunningly voiced by Scarlett Johansson) offers a beguiling--if presumably short-lived--intimacy. (""You can be with me if you want. Ill keep you near"" she purrs coils slowly tightening.) And thanks to the equally delicious casting of Christopher Walken as King Louie his offer of ""protection"" attains another dimension altogether. Moreover this time out Mowglis ultimate decision is both more satisfying and better in keeping with the temper of the times the belated correction of a moral and cinematic flaw almost half a century old.Ben Kingsley is such an obvious pick to voice the benevolent concern of Bagheera that its almost hard to imagine the filmmakers considering anyone else. Choosing Bill Murray for Baloo was a greater gamble but rather than descend into schtick he offers a gentle almost wistful interpretation of the big bear. Shere Khan may have been trickiest casting of all given the towering vocal performance with which George Sanders supplied the original film. But the choice of Idris Elba offers an ingenious alternative a tiger less urbane and still more menacing fearsome in his nonchalant physicality. Lupita Nyongo meanwhile is remarkably moving in the expanded (though still small) role of Raksha Mowglis wolf-mother.The Jungle Book is perhaps the oddest of species a movie nearly devoid of human beings yet one bursting with humanity.The CGI--which encompasses not only all of these characters but the entire cinematic environment as well--is a modest revelation once again extending the boundaries of the possible. (Its a development about which I continue to have mixed feelings.) And as for virtually the sole human being in the middle of all this technological splendor newcomer Neel Sethi is good if not exactly indelible as Mowgli. Perhaps inevitably for a boy inhabiting a universe that will be largely conjured around him after the fact Sethi offers a performance that is less acting than embodiment--but he embodies Mowgli impeccably right down to the floppy haircut and the red swaddle-diaper.The visuals conjured by Favreau and the cinematographer Bill Pope are consistently first-rate from the intense action sequences--a stunning stampede of water buffalo more than one life-or-death encounter with Shere Khan--to the moments of quieter beauty a frog wiping a raindrop off its head; a regal simian cityscape; a recently shed snakeskin large enough to sheathe a school bus. The enchantingly inventive credit sequence that concludes the movie is almost worth the price of admission all on its own.Be advised This Jungle Book offers a substantially darker more frightening vision than its predecessor one that might not be appropriate for all children. When Shere Khan asks Mowglis wolf pack ""How many lives is a man cub worth?"" he does not mean the question rhetorically. And ""mans red flower""--i.e. fire--plays a larger role as well one as dangerous as any wild beast.King Louie has likewise evolved from be-bopping orangutan to hulking Gigantopithecus. Gone is the goofy comic relief of the Fab Four-y vultures. And the trumpeting pretensions of the prior films cartoon elephants have been replaced with the awesome silent majesty of a breed truly apart the towering god-like pachyderms who ""created the jungle.""That said The Jungle Book is by no means humorless. If anything its wit and tenderness set it apart more than its ferocity. Though not a musical per se it includes alluring elements of more than one of its predecessors songs. And I would be remiss if I did not mention a wonderful cameo by Garry Shandling--the last performance before his death last month at age 66--as a porcupine Ikki who appeared in the Kipling stories but not in Disneys earlier film.By the time its evolution is complete The Jungle Book has proven itself a minor Darwinian miracle perhaps the oddest of all species a movie nearly devoid of human beings yet one bursting with humanity. The very last line uttered in the film is ""I could get used to this."" Me too.

Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics.

We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Courtesy of Walt Disney Studios hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Walt Disney Studios 10-year-old Neel Sethi does persuasive work in The Jungle Books digitized world. Courtesy of Walt Disney Studios The camera pulls back from an old-looking animated incarnation of Disneys Cinderella castle logo directly into a very real-looking 3-D jungle at the outset of The Jungle Book. Critters plants waterfalls a teeming environment through which is plunging one little flesh-and-blood boy Mowgli running for his life scampering up tree-trunks swinging from vines to get away -- the camera careening after him also trying to get away -- from a huge black panther. Feats Of Technical Magic Bring Disneys New Jungle Book To Life Listen  758 758 Toggle more options Download Embed Embed Transcript When the boy loses his footing the panther leaps...and then lectures the lad that if he doesnt get better at running with the pack hes going to end up as someones dinner. Bagheera voiced by Ben Kingsley but persuasively furred clawed and ferocious is Mowglis guardian. He found the kid as an infant and got a wolf-pack to raise him. Now though the little man-cub is big enough that hes attracting attention -- negative attention -- from tiger Shere Khan voiced by Idris Elba who vows to slaughter wolves en masse if the lads not handed over. To spare the pack Mowgli sets off on his own...encountering assorted dangers Scarlett Johanssons seductive python; Christopher Walkens hulking orangutan (whos introduced in a winking nod to Apocalypse Now). Also Bill Murrays ferocious-looking softie of a bear Baloo who being afraid of heights enlists Mowglis aid in harvesting honey from cliffside bees. Jokes aside theres more at stake here than in the 1967 cartoon version of Rudyard Kiplings Mowgli stories the last animated feature film that Walt Disney personally supervised. The tone and look are different of course and the episodic structure has been massaged a bit to give it the feel of an adventure blockbuster. But theres also a darker throughline Mowgli losing father figures right and left not to mention nearly getting pummeled by a mudslide trampled in a stampede stung bitten burned and manhandled. All of which is to say that most of the real world challenges that Leo DiCaprio faced in The Revenant 10-year-old Neel Sethi faces plenty persuasively in The Jungle Books digitized world. Though he was mostly acting in a blue-screen environment its a world that Iron Man director Jon Favreau had me so fully accepting as real that about an hour in when Baloo started singing I confess it bugged me. And yes I know ""Talking bear? No problem. Singing bear? Not realistic"" is not a defensible position. Shift in tone sounds better but really Im grasping at straws. And Im doing so even as I marvel at an astonishing visual experience tricked up with in-jokes -- water splashing on the camera lens when there isnt actually water or a lens because everything but the boy was created digitally. In fact the most genuinely astonishing thing on screen may just be the last line in the credits. Five words ""Filmed... in Downtown... Los Angeles.""

The film also stars Ben Kingsley Idris Elba Lupita Nyongo and Bill Murray. By Peter Rainer Film critic April 15 2016 Save for later Saved Disney About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Disneys 3-D ""The Jungle Book"" directed by Jon Favreau is the second go-round for the studio with this material - the first was in 1967 - and the state of movie technology has sure come a long way. The computer-generated effects are extraordinary; the jungle and its menagerie of beasts and critters looks positively lifelike. Rudyard Kiplings stories such as they have survived in numerous films over the years still have a basic enchantment for children and because of the imaginative effects in this new film adults may get caught up as well. The saga follows the orphaned Indian boy Mowgli (Neel Sethi limber but a bit over-rehearsed) who was raised by wolves and is now trekking into the jungle to join his own species. A number of wonderfully voiced characters turn up on the journey including the black panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) who also narrates the film; the villainous tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba); Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) a seductive serpent; the honey-loving bear Baloo (unmistakably Bill Murray); and the gigantic floppy orangutan King Louie (even more unmistakably Christopher Walken). Thankfully the usual Disney cutesy factor is relatively low and the script by Justin Marks is more literate than usual for this sort of thing. There are even some end credits that for a change are actually funny. Grade B+ (Rated PG for some sequences of scary action and peril.)

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 15 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 15 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jon Favreau Written by Justin Marks Starring Neel Sethi Ben Kingsley and Bill Murray Classification PG Country USA Language English The 1967 animated version of The Jungle Book was the last Disney movie made during Walt Disneys lifetime. The story goes that when the creative team first showed him the script and music he found it too dark and encouraged the artists to further sweeten their source material the stories by English writer Rudyard Kipling. The final movie was a childrens musical full of cheerfully drawn talking animals a happy tribe whose most predatory members were more amusing than scary and whose most delightful included a swinging orangutan voiced by Louis Prima and a quartet of vultures who sounded suspiciously like the Beatles. The memorable songs of those friendly cartoon characters still ring in many adult ears. Young Jungle Book star talks hanging out with Bill Murray (CP Video) The Little Prince invites the audience to celebrate the purified wonder of youth and the dazzle of lifes invisible indispensables. eOne review The Little Prince Delightful adaptation takes trek to follow dreams find love Unlikely partners Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) Zootopias first bunny cop and Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) a con-artist fox find themselves working together to solve a mystery. Disney Review Zootopia Fun for kids but adults may think twice about movies message Aardman Animations creators of last years Shaun the Sheep film will be honoured at this years TIFF Kids International Film Festival. news TIFF kids film festival salutes pioneer in stop-motion animation But Disney has greatly expanded its palette since the sixties and contemporary computers can create talking animals who look every bit as cute or as frightening as real ones. As Disney reintroduces The Jungle Book as a live-action and CGI feature in 3-D the famed studio offers a visually stunning and highly dramatic movie that pays only brief homage to the music of its predecessor and whose threatening characters and scary moments would surely have given Walt the heebie-jeebies.Mowgli the man cub raised by wolves is played by the swaggering little Neel Sethi the only principal actor who is actually seen onscreen. He is a child filled with irrepressible charm and energy and tends to speak his lines with the bold assurance of the smartass North American kid that he is. (Hes a New York actor making his feature debut.) The effect as he argues with the panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) about his future or remonstrates with the bear Baloo (Bill Murray) when he gets stung by bees proves comically endearing without becoming saccharine.He also manages to make the softer moments touching; generally his fine performance is a vindication of the decision to make the film live action - or at least to make his part of it live action. In fact all that surrounds him is computer-generated and however much the remarkably engaging evidence of the lush jungle towering cliffs and powerful animals might suggest otherwise the whole film was actually shot on a Hollywood sound stage.Neel is then surrounded by a powerful voice cast playing the various animals pitting Kingsleys wise Bagheera against the frightening Shere Khan voiced by Idris Elba. As scriptwriter Justin Marks both deepens and tightens the tension on the Disney story (which departed significantly from Kiplings) these actors are asked to play genuinely menacing or imperfect characters. Murrays Baloo for example is not merely the lovable slacker and glutton; his initial manipulation of Mowglis innocence is distressing and Bagheera very rightly dismisses him as a con man.Meanwhile King Louie (Christopher Walken) once he appears from the depths of his ruined temple is monstrous and his desire for fire the red flower that separates man from animal is the ambition of a villainous megalomaniac. In keeping with this much nastier view of the ape Walken only sing-speaks a few lines of the characters amusing quest for power ""Now Im the king of the swingers the jungle VIP ..."" while the rest of the familiar song is saved for the credits. Only Murrays Baloo gets to actually deliver his full piece The Bear Necessities that enduring salute to taking it easy as he floats down the river with Mowgli.Director Jon Favreau (Iron Man) is highly adept at having his cake and eating it too throughout the film wowing audiences with effects and amusing them with talking animals all the while insisting The Jungle Book is a difficult story about a human whose presence threatens to disrupt the jungles peace. Adults are going to appreciate that achievement but it does pose a few problems.First of all this movie is scary. Todays kids whose video games accustom them to volume violence and startling effects are a hardened lot compared with the children of the 1960s. Nonetheless there are many scenes here - various attacks by Shere Khan Mowglis encounter with the python Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) and fire in the forest - that are truly frightening and certainly arent going to work with a preschool audience.Second the film clearly signals to adults that the boy cannot stay with his animal friends forever - notwithstanding the obvious example of Tarzan (who gets his own remake this summer). Yet Favreau and Marks can find no palatable equivalent for the 1967 ending in which a goggle-eyed Mowgli follows a girl back to the human village. Kipling did imagine Mowgli growing up and encountering other humans in The Second Jungle Book a work that this script has already mined for other scenes. After the surprisingly sweet yet inconclusive ending that it does offer its no surprise to learn that a sequel to this impressively dark version of The Jungle Book is already in the works.

And it creates a magnificent living breathing world that fills every inch of the frame with a sense of wonder.Director Jon Favreau combining the youthful excitement of ""Zathura"" with the blockbuster momentum of ""Iron Man"" brings heart and soul to this rich adventure tale about a boy named Mowgli (Neel Sethi) raised as a ""man cub"" in the jungle.Bolstered by seamless special effects and a first-rate cast of voice talent including Ben Kingsley Idris Elba Bill Murray Scarlett Johansson and Christopher Walken Favreau brings his world to full vivid life. This ""Jungle"" has a pulse.We first meet Mowgli as hes dashing through the jungle with Bagheera (Kingsley) a black panther who acts as his father figure. Bagheera brought Mowgli to a pack of wolves when he was a baby and he was raised by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyongo) as if he was one of their own.During a gathering at Peace Rock where all of the jungles creatures convene to drink water Mowgli is sniffed out by Shere Khan (a menacing Idris Elba) a Bengal tiger with no tolerance for humans. He issues an edict to Mowglis wolf family to turn the boy over to him which sends Mowgli out into the jungle on his own.From there ""The Jungle Book"" becomes a series of colorful vignettes each marked by the appearance of a different signature character. Mowgli first comes across Kaa an enormous python voiced with slithering seduction by Johansson who nearly squeezes him to death.He then makes the acquaintance of Baloo (Murray) a friendly bear who enlists Mowgli to help him score mass amounts of honey and teaches him -- in song of course -- about ""The Bare Necessities"" of life. Murrays lazy charm is a natural fit for Baloo who is given Murrays soft eyes and worn face.Finally Mowgli meets the great King Louie a gargantuan orangutan voiced with the unmistakable staccato irregularity of Christopher Walken. In a movie teeming with visual splendor Louie is the most towering creation of all and Walkens offbeat rhythm brings a strange humanity to the huge beast.""The Jungle Book"" keeps up a brisk pace and never lags; there is something new around every corner. Elbas Shere Khan is genuinely frightening -- his presence may be disturbing for younger children -- but Favreau (along with screenwriter Justin Marks working from Rudyard Kiplings book) does a fine job of toggling between moments of suspense and comic relief while keeping the action quotient high.If theres a weakness its Sethi whose presence lacks on screen. Hes believable as a boy in the jungle but as an actor he struggles to deliver the might needed during the films final confrontation. Hes the films lone human element but its everything else on screen that makes it feel real.Its a minor quibble in a film that will be celebrated and rightly so as one of the years best family films. Its the rare remake that gets things right and Favreau makes this ""Book"" a genuine page-turner.agrahamdetroitnews.com(313) 222-2284twitter.com/grahamoramaThe Jungle BookGRADE A-Rated PG for some sequences of scary action and perilRunning time 111 minutes 44 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1SdJqr6 TOP VIDEOS Oakland County Sheriff car chase052East Detroit Schools CEO superintendent ready to work together333Trump denies he encouraged Russia to hack Clinton emails035Donald Trump discusses pulling out of NAFTA tariff for Ford123Zoom Gas Station029Surveillance video of breaking and entering029Highland Park eco village brings basics back to Avalon Street2572016 Festival of Chariots parade154Debbie Dingell adresses unity town hall meeting118World Peace mural135 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/adam-graham/2016/04/14/movie-review-splendid-jungle-book-remake-done-right/83065194/,200,thejunglebook(2016)7,thejunglebook(2016),detroitnews

In it a young boy can survive in the jungle and learn from the animals who raise him or a mongoose can protect an entire family from some slithering cobras. Its a world of lessons and moralities but also adventure and daring. One in which a bear can be the best friend of a boy and a panther can become a surrogate dad. Director Jon Favreau (Elf Iron Man) has done a marvelous job re-creating that world in his live-action/CGI adaptation. The Jungle Book which is a mash-up of Kiplings story collection and the 1967 Disney cartoon is gorgeous to look at. The visuals only improve on Kiplings stellar book. Mowgli (newcomer Neeli Sethi who spends the entire movie acting opposite CGI characters) is adopted by the panther Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley) after the boys father dies. Bagheera takes him to the wolves and helps raise Mowgli teaching him the rules of the jungle in ways that reflect the human world we live in - stick with the pack dont play with fire. But when the evil tiger Shere Khan (a menacing Idris Elba) discovers Mowgli the tiger vows to kill the little man-cub. So Bagheera sets out to take Mowgli back to the man-village. Joining Mowgli along the way is the sloth bear Baloo - played by Bill Murray whose voice and general persona exude the characters credo that life should be full of everyday pleasures and little else. He even gets to sing Baloos famed theme song ""The Bare Necessities"" originally sung by Phil Harris. Its an interesting choice for Favreau to call back to the Disney version. He does it again when Christopher Walken takes over for Louis Prima as the giant ape King Louie to sing ""I Wanna Be Like You."" At first this was jarring taking me out of the world that Favreau has constructed. But the music adds a necessary levity especially since Favreau does not shy away from the dark parts of the jungle. Characters fight and die which didnt seem to bother children in the theater as much as I thought it would. The reason to go see Favreaus The Jungle Book instead of just watching the animated one with your cubs is how gorgeous the jungle looks. The temple that King Louie calls his kingdom is breathtaking and it seems as if every hair of Shere Khans fur moves as he stalks. Its the living jungle of Kiplings stories that we could once see only in our minds. meichelphillynews.com215-854-5909 The Jungle BookDirected by Jon Favreau.

Disney Disney Disney The Jungle Book      (out of five) Director Jon Favreau Cast Neel Sethi Ben Kingsley Bill Murray Scarlett Johansson Christopher Walken Rated PG (scary action and peril) Running time 105 min. By Maricar Estrelladfw.comPosted 1058am on Thursday Apr. 14 2016 Thursday Apr. 14 2016 Wednesday Apr. 13 2016 By Maricar Estrella Fort Worth Star-Telegram In the opening sequence of Disneys re-telling of the classic novel The Jungle Book Mowgli (played delightfully by newcomer Neel Sethi) runs through the jungle like a live-action version of the video game Temple Run. Mowgli is running with the wolves with the guidance of Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley) his wise panther paternal type. The coupling of Kingsleys noble narration and wide-eyed Sethis endearing performance provides the heartfelt base of an imaginative and adventurous remake of Disneys 1967 animated film.Based on Rudyard Kiplings timeless tale of a ""man-cub"" being raised by a family of wolves the new films stunning computer-generated creatures and backdrop put audiences right in the middle of the jungle.Its one of the few films in which the 3D enhancement is justified. Each scene captures the essence of each animal so vividly that children in the audience were reaching out to the screen to try to ""touch"" the fur. After Mowglis tribe of wolves gets threatened by menacing tiger Shere Khan (voiced by Idris Elba) the boy is urged to abandon the only home he has known to find his own kind for his own safety. While the wolf pack leader Akela ( Giancarlo Esposito) and his protective mother wolf Raksha ( Lupita Nyongo) debate the circumstances Mowgli decides to take the matter in his own hands and sets out on an epic adventure.Along the way he meets a seductive python Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) and befriends a bombastic bear Baloo ( Bill Murray) who sings The Jungle Books beloved song Bare Necessities.The all-star cast provides such depth to their animal counterparts with one exception. Christopher Walkens gargantuan orangutan King Louie is played a bit over the top and his ominous rendition of I Wanna Be Like You brings an unnecessary dark tone to an otherwise uplifting film.Parents should be warned there are some dark and violent scenes in the film that may not be suitable for younger children. However directed by Jon Favreau ( Iron Man) the enthralling blend of live action and CGI is officially the first big family hit of the season and will certainly spawn a sequel.

"Jungle Book is a sweet and scary triumph of modern moviemaking - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Jungle Book is a sweet and scary triumph of modern moviemaking The Jungle Book movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews The Jungle Book starring Neel SethiBen Kingsley Scarlett Johansson Idris Elba Bill Murray Lupita Nyongo Christopher Walken  and Giancarlo Esposito. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews The Jungle Book starring Neel SethiBen Kingsley Scarlett Johansson Idris Elba Bill Murray Lupita Nyongo Christopher Walken  and Giancarlo Esposito. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan ""The Jungle Book"" is the kind of family film calculated to make even those without families wish they had one to take along.By turns sweetly amusing and surprisingly unnerving crammed with story song and computer-generated visual splendors its such a model of modern crowd-pleasing entertainment that it brings to mind a celebrated quote by F. Scott Fitzgerald about filmmakers who were ""able to keep the whole equation of pictures in their heads."" See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Fitzgerald was thinking about studio heads specifically men like MGM boy-wonder Irving Thalberg but it seems to fit what director Jon Favreau (""Iron Man"" and the beloved ""Elf"") has done here. Making a film like ""Jungle Book"" go down as easily as this one does requires keeping any number of factors in balance to ensure they add up to an audience-friendly spectacle.Based on the celebrated 1894 story collection by Rudyard Kipling that details the exploits of an Indian boy named Mowgli raised by wolves and thus able to speak with animals ""The Jungle Book"" has been filmed numerous times starting with a 1942 effort starring the redoubtable Sabu. The favorite of modern viewers however was Disneys 1967 animated version a genial pleasure that featured eight marvelous original songs. The key challenge Favreau and screenwriter Justin Marks faced and met was nodding to that cheerful version while giving the new one the kind of tension and jeopardy that contemporary family films seem to insist on.The other challenge also well met was to create a simultaneously believable yet fantastical jungle world (over 100000 photographs were taken in India and used for reference) where credible photorealistic animals talked and negotiated among themselves like so many ambassadors to the United Nations. Only funnier. Jungle Book is a sweet and scary triumph of modern moviemaking Disney Enterprises Inc An undaunted Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi) encounters the giant python Kaa (hypnotically voiced by Scarlett Johansson). An undaunted Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi) encounters the giant python Kaa (hypnotically voiced by Scarlett Johansson). (Disney Enterprises Inc) Photographed by Bill Pope (""The Matrix) and overseen by veteran visual-effects supervisor Robert Legato the large number of computer-generated species underline the obvious This film is a tribute to and would not have been possible without the latest effects technology up to and including motion capture and digitally built environments.Adding to the effectiveness of the prominent animals everyone remembers -- including Bagheera the solemn panther; Shere Khan the terrifying Bengal tiger; and of course Baloo the conniving but fun-centric bear -- is the spectacular voice casting that has become a Disney trademark allowing each creature to be all it should be and even a little bit more. Its Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) who serves as narrator and in fact begins the story by bringing an all-alone human baby he finds in the jungle to a family of wolves led by father Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and mother Raksha (Lupita Nyongo) to be raised.Though the boy Mowgli tries his hardest to be as fast and agile as a wolf cub the films opening chase sequence shows this is simply not happening. His wolf family loves him anyway and he joins them in solemnly reciting the Law of the Jungle ""The strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack.""Conversely the only areas where Mowgli excels situations that involve things like working with tools are forbidden to the boy by the severe Bagheera because ""tricks are not the wolf way."" Jungle Book trailer Watch the trailer for ""The Jungle Book"" Watch the trailer for ""The Jungle Book"" See more videos Getting the role of the boy Mowgli the only human actor visible on screen is young Neel Sethi an active lad who had never acted before but was chosen out of some 2000 who auditioned. Sethi was given parkour training to enhance his nature athleticism and puppeteers from Jim Hensons Creature Shop were employed to impersonate his CGI costars and give him something tangible to act against.""The Jungle Book"" begins with whats called a water truce a timeout called during a drought that enables all animals to gather at a water hole without fear of being eaten by larger more predatory types.Unfortunately one of the animals that shows up is the dreaded Shere Khan (sinisterly voiced by Idris Elba) who announces for reasons to be revealed that the ""man-cub"" is on his hit list and that he will return to take Mowglis life once the truce is over.Bagheera hopes to save Mowgli by taking him to a man village but the headstrong boy (""a Dennis the Menace type"" says Favreau) resists. That plus his naivete leads to encounters that put Mowgli in all kinds of jeopardy.Most hypnotic both literally and figuratively is the massive python Kaa spectacularly voiced by Scarlett Johansson who reinforces the notion begun with Spike Jonzes ""Her"" that she can totally transfix audiences with her voice alone.

At the end of Disneys CinemaCon presentation featuring a trailer for Marvels ""Doctor Strange"" and footage from Pixars ""Finding Dory"" studio distribution chief Dave Hollis delivered a reassuring message to cinema owners in Las Vegas. ""Our commitment to the theatrical window has never ever... (Ryan Faughnder) Then there is King Louie a massive Gigantopithecus who has big plans for Mowgli. Christopher Walken may seem an unlikely choice for this big ape but his mellifluous New York tones and his ability to get the most out of the classic Sherman Brothers ""I Wanna Be Like You"" song will win you over.Most entertaining inevitably is Bill Murrays Baloo the bear a genial silver-tongued con artist who tells Mowgli with a straight face ""you have never met a more endangered species than me"" and enlists him as a co-conspirator in the eternal search for honey.As noted this ""Jungle Book"" does have its darker side not only jeopardy for Mowgli but hints of the danger that humans pose to the entire natural world. Fire ""the red flower"" is a key plot element characterized as a human creation that brings destruction to the pristine landscape. Touching all the bases even this one is second nature to Favreaus film and its impressive to see how effortless he makes it seem.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------The Jungle BookMPAA rating PG for some sequences of scary action and perilRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on April 15 2016 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""alluring `Jungle - A sweet and scary triumph of filmmaking - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Movies Entertainment Jon Favreau Reviews Neel Sethi Scarlett Johansson Ben Kingsley Jungle Book director Jon Favreau keeps the 19th century Kipling tone but updates the classic for modern times Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-jungle-book-review-20160415-column.html#nt=oft13a-2gp1,200,thejunglebook(2016)10,thejunglebook(2016),latimes

Entertainment ""The Jungle Book"" Is Full Of Wonder And Occasional Nightmare Fuel Like the best childrens movies The Jungle Book is enchanting and scary. But its also held back by obligations to the Disney original. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Baloo (voiced by Bill Murray) and Mowgli (Neel Sethi). Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures ID 8442449 Visual effects get used for everything from the creation of identical troll-like baddies to the adding of pubic hair to keeping actors forever young and digitally slenderized these days. But the new Jungle Book proves movie technology still has the power to create a sense of wonder.When the wolves and tigers and bears speak in the movie their lips (snouts whatever) move. It should look creepy or silly like Mister Ed those beastly mouths flapping and contorting into an approximation of human speech. But instead its weirdly magical like the talking animals of countless animated classics have finally been hauled into the real world without losing their capacity to communicate across species.Which is exactly what Disney is aiming for in revamping its 1967 animated musical for a 2016 audience thats looking for nostalgia and something new. Director Jon Favreau working from a screenplay Justin Marks adapted from the works of Rudyard Kipling has called forth a jungle out of a blue-screened Los Angeles soundstage and a carefully chosen voice cast. The lush vividness of it and its inhabitants is an impressive technical achievement. But the best recommendation for what Favreau and presumably many behind-the-scenes artists and technicians have pulled off is how quickly you stop thinking of the overclocked render farms on which it all came together and accept the world in which it takes places as humid verdant fact. View this image > Walt Disney Motion Pictures ID 8442871 The lone human character for most of the movie is Mowgli (10-year-old Neel Sethi) the orphan raised by wolves and by Bagheera the panther (Ben Kingsley) in the wild. But hes never alone. Hes been not always seamlessly integrated into a thriving ecosystem of predator and prey with its own rules and rulers.And the members of it look fantastic down to the disarray of fur on easygoing Baloo the bear (voiced by Bill Murray) as he surveys his honey trove to the not-quite-coordination of the wolf cubs heeding the call of their parents Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyongo) to the sinewy slink of menacing tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) up to the watering hole to the slither of Kaa the snakes (Scarlett Johansson) coils through the shadows.Theres not a trace of uncanny valley in The Jungle Books visuals that eeriness when an artificial creation is so close to real life that you can only see the flaws maybe because digital animals are easier to give warmth to than computer-created people. But as if to make up for the fact the movie figures out a whole other sort of awkward in-between space to occupy by getting close enough to an adventure movie of a more grown-up variety to make its childrens fable remnants all the more strange. View this image > Walt Disney Motion Pictures ID 8442828 The Jungle Book is the latest in a line of live-action remakes of Disney stalwarts an enterprise thats become a big part of the Mouse Houses movie game including both revisionist retellings like Maleficent and straightforward ones like Cinderella. The Jungle Book falls somewhere in between the two never really reworking the take on the story Disney made as its own but not parroting it back either. It dutifully nods to its animated predecessor with two song-and-dance sequences (Baloos ""The Bare Necessities"" and King Louies ""I Wanna Be Like You"") but no more than that making it a kind of half-musical. The tunes feel like a familiar but obtrusive gesture toward the past instead of falling in line with the rest of the tone. Favreaus take on the Kipling tales includes mentions of death -- directly with a character getting killed but also indirectly with an acknowledgment that offscreen some of these delightful characters eat other ones.Well all those adorable little wolves are going to grow up to nosh on something.Theres nothing wrong with a darker Jungle Book that acknowledges nature isnt all about getting along and when its really humming along Favreaus film feels like the kind of movie that both enchants and freaks out a kid in equal measure a future kindertrauma classic of the best kind. But the overall direction The Jungle Book takes doesnt jell with the occasional aspects of the narrative that treat Mowglis upbringing as a kind of Peter Pan escape from the tedium of human society. Humanity is the bogeyman the animals all fear in The Jungle Book -- humanity and the fire (the ""red flower"") we wield -- and its a desire to join humanity that infects and undoes King Louie (voiced by Christopher Walken) the most jarringly interpreted character a 10-foot Gigantopithecus looming out of the darkness the ape equivalent of Aragog. The problem is not how frightening he is when he chases Mowgli through the crumbling palace he and his monkey minions have taken over; its that before then the movie attempts to present him as comic relief speaking in the distinctive Walken rhythms and segueing him into a musical number. View this image > Walt Disney Motion Pictures ID 8442907 Photorealism all but demands a well grittier take on source material like this. The Jungle Books characters look like real animals and act more like them as well while Mowgli is believably childlike -- petulant still learning and inclined in a wonderful scene with the elephants to acts of unforced grace. But theres an unavoidable bit of realism that the movie pulls back on and thats the idea that a human boy can never just be one of the animals no matter how hard he tries. Theres a scene toward the movies climax in which all of the creatures of the jungle suddenly see Mowgli not as an adoptee but as an interloper -- not one of them at all but the man hes always been. Its a surprisingly upsetting moment the most provocative in the movie introducing the idea that Mowgli cant help but disrupt this delicate balance with his very nature.In the animated version this issue is resolved with a bittersweet ending that sends Mowgli back to his own kind. But this new Jungle Book opts for something else making the already-in-the-works sequel that much more easy to segue into but chipping away at its own otherwise mostly captivating vision in the process. When youve realized a world so gorgeously a reluctance to let it go is understandable but The Jungle Book suggests its main characters desire to stay is more important than the animals it brings to such incredible life.

Rated PG (mild scares and violence). The live-action remake of ""The Jungle Book"" takes place in a pitiless untamed landscape populated by all things scaly slimy and creepy. So vile and noxious are the creatures in Mowglis world that its almost as if he works at Gawker. Lushly photographed and told with a disarming sense of wonder the new version doesnt have quite as much heart as the 1967 animated musical but its a smartly executed merger of 21st-century special effects with the feel of those majestic nature-based films Disney used to make in the 1960s. Director Jon Favreau almost completely ignores the dire recent trends in kids movies -- toilet humor needlessly frenetic pacing smarmy contemporary references -- in favor of the grand Disney tradition of old-fashioned storytelling he doubtless recalls from youth. The menacing tiger Shere Khan (voiced by Idris Elba) demands that Mowgli (an engaging Neel Sethi) the ""man-cub"" raised by kindly wolves (Lupita Nyongo Giancarlo Esposito) be turned over to him in revenge for being wounded by Mowglis father who was killed in the fight. Instead Mowglis friend the panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) tells Mowgli to flee to a nearby village. On the way Mowgli makes friends with the bear Baloo (Bill Murray) and is confronted by the king of the apes (Christopher Walken) who covets the secret all humans are supposed to possess how to summon the magical ""red flower"" or fire. The animated ""Jungle Book"" made surprisingly effective use of 1960s bebop in its jazzy infectious clutch of songs two of which are reprised here. Yes Murray sings -- no great surprise -- ""The Bare Necessities"" with characteristic irony-inflected gusto. But Walken also gives his pipes a try and hearing him speak-sing ""I Wanna Be Like You"" in the guise of a 15-foot primate is one of the strangest things Ive seen at the movies lately. And yet its endearing even if the songs comical lyrics completely undercut the intended scariness of the scene. The plot is episodic sewing together several tales by Rudyard Kipling yet Favreau skillfully covers up the seams by increasing the pressure from Shere Khan. Mowgli also finds trouble with lesser malefactors such as a hypnotic python (voiced with ruthless bravado by Scarlett Johansson in an especially effective scene that may be too scary for younger kids). In a climactic wildfire during which Mowglis animal friends and enemies battle for the boy Favreau makes the danger exciting and intense enough for older kids and even adults. Probably no studio mulls its ""brands"" as obsessively as Disney does and ""The Jungle Book"" is very much a careful calculated brand extension not a reinvention. But thats just fine What better lesson to teach kids than respect for what came before you?

That means parents should pay close attention to which of their kids they take to the theatre and put a lot of thought into how they talk to them after the movie ends. There is a lot going on here including hyper-realistic action sequences a forest fire a wrenching death scene of a major character the reality of child abandonment and very scary threats to hero-boy Mowglis life when he is being hunted by the Bengal tiger Shere Khan. What all this means is that Jon Favreaus take on Rudyard Kiplings enduring fables is more mature and more visceral than the beloved Disney animation from 1967. Most adults will be as enthralled as their older children (although some individuals may be cynical including a film critic who has already confessed to rooting for the tiger). The childrens musical of 67 was hand-drawn in classic Disney style and directed by Wolfgang (Woolie) Reitherman. He was one of the famous Nine Old Men who worked with Walt Disney himself since the 1930s. Still enjoyable the animation delivers its moral lessons through giddy humour memorable songs and a lilting uplifting sense of childs play. But you do not have to reject the animated classic in order to enjoy the new film. Both are valid -- and very different. In addition to skewing older Favreaus hybrid creation is a technological miracle of contemporary filmmaking. He puts a live-action child into the middle of a CGI jungle in India that is teeming with animals which were also conjured through digital special effects. The astonishing thing is that the jungle and those animals all look remarkably ""real"" -- just larger and in some cases more colourful and individually eccentric than similar animals from life. Favreau deliberately exaggerated the size of creatures such as the gigantic orangutan King Louie to let us see them through a 10-year-old boys eyes (because everything in the world seems bigger when we are children). Plus the jungle itself is stylized. So the visuals are stunning to behold. If you found yourself impressed by the tiger on the raft in Life of Pi just three years ago this is Pi times infinity CGI special effects are evolving at an electrifying rate. Of course visuals are only the framework. Favreau needed a story. He and his screenwriter Justin Marks worked both from the original Kipling story collection of the late 1800s as well as the Disney animation which itself took a lot of liberties with Kipling. Favreau and Marks also let their own sensibilities run wild so their Jungle Book seems as fresh as it is familiar in the storytelling. Still our Man Cub Mowgli (played with boyish enthusiasm by New Yorker Neel Sethi) is raised by talking animals. So you have to indulge in the fantasy to relate to Mowglis mentor the black panther Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley) his fun-loving bear pal Baloo (Bill Murray) his Indian wolf step-mom Raksha (Lupita Nyongo) the seductive python Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) the noble wolf pack leader Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) the eccentric great ape King Louie (Christopher Walken) and Mowglis mortal enemy Shere Khan (Idris Elba). Murray and Elba steal the show in terms of voices while Johanssons femme fatale interpretation of Kaa is literally spellbinding -- for Mowgli and for us. But the most important thing is that all the major characters mesh and the story gets told with vivid imagination in play. We even get three songs to break up the darker passages Murrays take on The Bare Necessities Johanssons hypnotic tune and Walkens wild and woolly version of I Wanna be Like You (The Monkey Song). But Favreaus The Jungle Book is not really a musical nor for little kids. It is a powerful adventure story with dazzling fantasy elements and a high-stakes climax. It is so good that Disney executives have already authorized a sequel.

Courtesy of Walt Disney Studios There are all the other storybook villains who have prowled their way into the Disney canon and then theres Shere Khan the tiger. In Rudyard Kiplings The Jungle Book the savage cat will stop at nothing to hunt down Mowgli the young ""man-cub"" who was orphaned in the wilderness of Indias impossibly lush Madhya Pradesh region and raised by wolves. Shere Khans determination seems vicious until you remember that hes a natural predator trying to dominate the only animal in town who outranks him -- and that Mowglis is the very species that will eventually render Bengal tigers like him endangered in the process of destroying jungle habitats the world over. Shere Khans ""eat all men"" stance really just makes him a radical conservationist. Feats Of Technical Magic Bring Disneys New Jungle Book To Life Listen  758 758 Toggle more options Download Embed Embed Transcript ""But Mowglis just a kid"" you may say to which this latest Jungle Books wolf-pack head Akela has the perfect answer ""In some tribes the runts get eaten."" This is no safe Zootopia One of the many delights of director Jon Favreaus update is how it embraces both the constant threat and the constant wonder of the jungle. They are two sides of the same coin naturally. Kiplings book has been the seed of many a screen project most unfaithful (but he himself borrowed parts of it from other sources so true fidelity seems like a meaningless ideal here). There was the 1942 Technicolor version starring a young Sabu and real animals and two unrelated sorta-sequels in 1994 and 1997--a sequence that will be repeated with this movie and Warner Brothers own unrelated remake due in 2018. (They travel in packs. Its the law of the jungle.) The best-known though is Disneys bright and colorful 1967 animated musical that gave us the jazz-pop standards ""The Bear Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You."" This is the version the latest iteration bows to much as its characters bow to the elephants who form their jungles creation myth. Though darker in tone and more suitable for older kids Disneys new take retains the undeniably fun spirit of the earlier film. The dialogue is clever (Justin Marks is the credited screenwriter) and newcomer Neel Sethi is captivating as Mowgli shining through a matty full head of dark hair as he navigates his all-CGI jungle and pets a fake bear with the utmost conviction. The film is technically live-action in the sense that theres a real-life Mowgli wandering around an L.A. studio set. But in practice its just as animated as its predecessor since Mowgli is the only real thing onscreen. Whats impressive is how the animals can boast realistic physiques and motion-capture-aided movements with fur that rustles in the wind while also taking on a cartoon expressiveness that feels utterly fitting rather than off-putting. The gifted special-effects team adopted many of the techniques used on Avatar including shooting in 3-D which is convincing enough that some critics (ahem) may or may not have flinched at a falling tree branch. Cinematographer Bill Pope whos seen his cameras through many a digital blockbuster conjures a sweeping expansiveness that lets us sense the rustling life in every corner of the ""wild."" (There may also be a visual homage or two to The Lion King.) The voice cast is top-notch. Somehow it feels exactly right to have Bill Murray play crafty fun-loving bear Baloo whose enthusiasm for his new human companion is wholly genuine and to pair Christopher Walken with the orange gigantopithecus (thats ""really big ape"" to you buddy) King Louie who lords over his primate kingdom in shadow like General Kurtz. And it also feels right to let Murray and Walken each reprise their characters signature musical ditties in lazy Dixieland lounge-singer rhythms that dont need to follow the beat. The wolf couple who raise Mowgli as their own are played by Giancarlo Esposito and Lupita Nyongo with a warm pack mentality while Ben Kingsley and Scarlett Johansson drop in as respectively watchful panther Bagheera and siren snake Kaa. And then Idris Elba -- growling snarling vicious -- renders Shere Khan like well the predator he is. Hes the one whose aggressions toward Mowgli propel the child from the safety of the wolfpack into the untamed land beyond and ultimately to the ""red flower"" of fire the devilish work of man and the biggest threat to the jungles way of life. It may be Shere Khans Burden to be the eternal villain of the piece but the rest of the film is there to benefit. Favreau has quietly become a gifted helmer of distinctly human projects from the big (Iron Man) to the small-ish (Chef). The Jungle Book has only one human but it will delight many more. Especially the runts.

The film is a triumph of technology and safe ""family"" storytelling. Its dazzling -- almost no one will dislike it. Its director Jon Favreau knows his audience and he has enough skill and honest enthusiasm to win over all but the most determined skeptics. The gimmick is that the movie uses a real actor Neel Sethi (pronounced Sett-ee) as Mowgli the boy raised by wolves. But Sethi is surrounded by brilliantly computer-animated wolves panthers tigers and bears. At times they look more real than the actor who seems computer-enhanced -- made smoother his skin burnished with a golden Disney-ish caramel or made to fly at impossible speeds when hes carried off by monkeys. The slight artificiality of everything makes The Jungle Book seem all the more seamless. Untethered by reality its settings are huge its cliffs and waterfalls like something out of James Camerons Avatar. And that makes sense since Mowgli is our avatar -- the wide-eyed human who holds his own against beasts of the jungle and finally earns his place in the natural world. Do you remember the plot from the Kipling stories or the a40s feature starring Sabu or the hit 1967 Disney cartoon? Itas more or less the same. As a baby Mowgli was delivered to the wolves by a black panther named Bagheera whoas voiced with stentorian British plumminess by Oscar winner Sir Ben Kingsley. Bagheera remains a sort of headmaster commanding Mowgli to use only his wolf skills not his human opposable-thumb ingenuity. The doting mother wolf is voiced by Oscar winner Lupita Nyongo. Idris Elba is the nasty tiger Shere Khan. Giancarlo Esposito is the alpha wolf. The late Garry Shandling is a porcupine. Favreau is a pygmy hog and his kids are in there as some of the cubs who consider Mowgli their brother. Itas a cozy A-list kinda jungle. And a veritable Disney World too. These animals have a near-utopian existence -- even happier than the one in this years other animated hit Zootopia. During the dry season various species declare a truce and gather at a stream to share what little water is available. When the level rises above a certain rock theyll supposedly go back to business but its hard to picture these cuddly creatures eating anything but plants (assuming the plants dont sing). Well there is that tiger Shere Khan who has a peculiar antipathy towards the ""man cub."" To protect Mowgli the wolves decide to send him back to the human village from which he came. But getting there wont be a walk in the park. The journey is thrillingly kinetic. Watch Mowgli grab the horns of some charging buffaloes (or bison -- Im not good on bovine species) and go hurtling over a cliff. Watch a very friendly 30-foot python named Kaa (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) curl around him and open her mouth wide so wide. Eventually Mowgli ends up in the cave of a supremely lazy bear named Baloo. The bear -- voiced by Bill Murray -- promptly puts Mowgli to work climbing cliffs to steal honey to fatten him up for hibernation. But do jungle bears hibernate? Murray is an irresistible sleazy hipster an ursine Peter Venkman. The only problem is that he has one of the best songs in the Disney canon the Sherman brotherss ""The Bare Necessities"" and he doesnt really ... he isnt quite ... He cant sing. So he wails in time -- he tries to do it bluesy -- and kills the great melody. I had to go home and listen to Phil Harriss original from the 67 cartoon to quench my thirst for the actual notes. The rest of the music is terrific. The Jungle Book has a jazzy score by John Debney and a hilarious Marlon Brando-in-Apocalypse Now parody by Christopher Walken as the humongous orangutan-like ape King Louie. And there I would leave it except ... Favreau has told the press that this Jungle Book is closer to Kiplings original insofar as the animals are savage and Shere Khan does get into it with Bagheera and even Baloo. Little kids might be shaken up. Some grown-ups too. But this isnt Kipling. Its not the fashion these days to speak up on behalf of the Bombay-born Englishman who was thoroughly comfortable with British colonialism. But I was weaned on his Jungle Book stories. The Just So stories were just so. I wanted a mongoose after Rikki Tikki Tavi. Its Kiplings grasp of politics that makes his work exciting on so many levels. I mean interpersonal politics -- or in this case inter-species. His animals do cooperate and in some cases risk their lives for humans. But theyre plainly predators and their main concern is the survival of their species. In the stories the wolf pack wants to kill Mowgli after the man-cubs protector ages out of his alpha-male status. Kaa the python is so much more interesting than in the movie He (hes a he) cooperates with Bagheera and Baloo to save Mowgli from the monkeys only after they promise to share their future kills. And Mowgli from the start knows hell have to destroy the tiger Shere Khan to ensure his own survival. He knows the real law of the jungle. The point is that Kipling sweetens this world without sanitizing it and no matter how much his vision reeks of patriarchal colonialist condescension its a damn sight more acute than the Disney Companys. Dont misunderstand This version of The Jungle Book is wonderful. But what does it say when even a myopic colonialist has a deeper vision of how the world works?

(Walt Disney Pictures)  Newcomer Neel Sethi is a dynamo as man-cub Mowgli the child raised by wolves (Lupita Nyongo and Giancarlo Esposito) after hes found in the jungle as an abandoned infant. Sethi is the human in the picture but hes so animated in voice and gesture its as if he stepped out of the cartoon original.The story nods to the familiar with its coming-of-age tale of loin-clothed Mowgli leaving the wolf pack and striking out on his own. Hes forced out by Shere Khans hungry teeth and the human-posed threat of fire -- which the animals fearfully call ""the red flower."" And while the film isnt strictly a musical like its 1967 ancestor two song favourites get the once-over-lightly treatment Baloos ""The Bare Necessities"" and Louies ""I Wanna Be Like You"" sung-spoken by Murray and Walken with more winking fun than vocal talent.One significant change in the script credited to Justin Marks is greater adherence to Rudyard Kiplings original 1894 literary creation of The Jungle Book a series of short stories set in the wilds of India. The real dangers of jungle life that Kipling well understood are on the screen especially in scenes featuring the rapacious Shere Khan. Parents should take heed of the PG rating and the appended warnings ""frightening scenes"" and ""not recommended for young children.""But for all but the most timid of moviegoers this live-action revival of The Jungle Book serves cherished memories while offering much more than just the bare necessities of entertainment.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger ShereKhan promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Its hard not to think of ""The Jungle Book"" remake as a feast. It is a banquet of storytelling delicacy exciting light drama athletic action and computer-generated imagery that is more hyper-real than real. After every delicious scene I wanted seconds. Based on the 1967 animated musical the last feature created under Walt Disneys guidance this re-creation is a case of a studio honoring its artistic legacy with consummate care while moving it in a new direction. An established classic tale has been lifted to an even greater level toning down the jokes and ramping up the excitement. This version will carry those who have never encountered Rudyard Kiplings tales or the original film as high as the most devoted fans. This is moviemaking that is both gigantic and subtle exciting and simple. It is not just set in the wild it is wild. Like ""The Lion King"" it welcomes us to an animal kingdom with real nobility and joins spectacle and humor with touching moments of unabashed sentiment. Director Jon Favreau who has progressed from a winning actors director in ""Swingers"" and ""Elf"" to a master special-effects illusionist in two Iron Man blockbusters here uses every skill in his utility belt. He creates a world where animals look as they do yet convey stunningly precise human feelings to Mowgli the orphaned ""man cub"" raised by wolves in an Indian forest. Its a place where there is cross-species jingoism and animosity can erupt with fang and claw. Idris Elba is a nasty piece of work voicing the predatory tiger Shere Khan Scarlett Johansson is simultaneously feminine and hypnotic as the devious python Kaa Lupita Nyongo is touchingly protective as Mowglis adoptive mother and Bill Murray is impish fun as Baloo a hedonist bear who has transformed idleness into a philosophy until hes provoked. Hes the sly uncle every child wants and every guy hopes to become. The wildlife deliver breathtakingly expressive performances matching their all-star vocal backers across a broad range of characters. Yet they never stumble into the uncanny valley that triggers our revulsion toward creatures that appear nearly human. There is nothing weird about these characters. They are beasts with big personalities. When Christopher Walkens power-hungry giant ape King Louie appears in the shadowed interior of a crumbling ruin rubbing his temple precisely like Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now"" its a brilliant moment of suspense and a superb inside joke. Disney Associated Press In this image released by Disney Mowgli portrayed by Neel Sethi right and Baloo the bear voiced by Bill Murray appear in a scene from ""The Jungle Book."" Neel Sethi is the sole human performer here and he is a talent to treasure. Dynamic when hes on the run (which is often) naturalistic in his close connection to the animals and credible when his human instincts make him construct clever gadgets he is every bit the equal of the photorealist beasts created by Weta Digital. I left the film hoping he doesnt grow out of camera-friendly looks as so many child stars do but if he does this film is a big enough gift on its own. Some passages would benefit from creative tweaking. The film reprises ""The Bear Necessities"" and ""I Want to Be Like You"" though those beloved songs dont fit this version of the story. And it sends Mowgli jumping and running along the jungle floor and across trees in sequences that feel like off-puttingly lengthy arcade games. The first move feels like a decision based on releasing a new soundtrack album for grown-up fans the second to sell millions of kids Disney action apps which have become a profitable part of the Magic Kingdom. They didnt need to cram that product placement into this lovely film. The ticket sales will repay their investment just fine.

Mowgli (Neel Sethi) may not think of himself as an animal but he definitely doesnt identify as human. Raised by wolves he enjoys running through the jungle with the pack. Sometimes hell do something a wolf cant -- such as climbing a tree -- but thats only in the spirit of gaining a competitive advantage.Its left to Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley) a panther who serves as Mowglis mentor to remind him that hes a little boy -- and that the jungle is becoming an increasingly dangerous place for him to live. Thats largely due to one animal who can barely tolerate Mowglis presence a tiger named Shere Khan (Idris Elba) who seems to take pleasure in terrorizing every creature who crosses his path.Mowgli is reluctant to give up his life among the wolves but he has no interest in winding up as Shere Khans dinner. So the wild child embarks on a journey during which hell encounter smooth-talking python Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) honey-loving bear Baloo (Bill Murray) and megalomaniacal ape King Louie (Christopher Walken). But no matter where Mowgli goes the threat of Shere Khan remains. A confrontation with the tiger is only a matter of time. ""The Jungle Book"" entertainingly updates the adventures of Mowgli -- who was created by Rudyard Kipling and was also the focus of a 1967 animated film of the same name -- for a contemporary audience. This 3-D retelling is like a storybook come to life enhanced by the vivid photorealism of the computer-generated imagery. Working from a screenplay by Justin Marks director Jon Favreau (""Iron Man"") has a sure feel for whats required and in Sethi he has a young actor whos engaging without being cutesy. The vocal performances are spot-on with Murray a standout as the slyly manipulative but ultimately courageous Baloo.With its combination of state-of-the-art technology and old-school charm ""The Jungle Book"" should thrill children and adults alike.What ""The Jungle Book""  Three stars out of four  Run time 145  Rating PG  Content Sequences of scary action and peril Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags The Jungle Book Calvin Wilson Ben Kingsley Neel Sethi Idris Elba Scarlett Johansson Bill Murray Christopher Walken Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Like ""Avatar"" before it this CG and live-action interpretation of Rudyard Kiplings classic tale of a boy raised by wolves feels like a momentous occasion in the technical advancements of big-budget cinema.From the thrill of a distant waterfall to the terror of a mudslide or stampeding buffalo Favreau and his visual effects maestros have created artificial living things that truly look and feel real.Even the animals ability to communicate in English seems as natural as their breathing and emoting. They have not been sanitized to be cute or less threatening either -- not even tender mama wolf Raksha (Lupita Nyongo).They still look like wild animals and for the most part act like wild animals too. At first this actually makes their close interactions with the human boy Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi) disarming. Eventually your nerves calm and you submit to the magic of Favreaus world.The story follows the same beats as Disneys animated feature from 1967 but the director and his team made sure to up the intensity a few notches -- the use of live-action animals necessitates it. They all have claws and teeth and they dont let your forget it.Youre already on edge by the time the tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba in a truly stunning vocal performance thats both terrifying and relatable) enters the picture. He adamantly believes that humans should not be living among them and is prepared to use whatever intimidation tactics are necessary to rid their world of Mowgli. This sends the young boy on a journey to the human village with the stoic panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). Anyone with the vaguest memory of ""The Jungle Book"" will remember the characters the boy encounters on the way -- the snake Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) the bear Baloo (Bill Murray) and the orangutan King Louie (Christopher Walken).Although it is somewhat distracting to have such famous voices overwhelming every scene each does a fine job -- especially Murray who brings a much-needed comedic lightness to the story with his affably conniving Baloo in the second act.Sethi is energetic and enthusiastic as Mowgli an adventurous kid whos as unfazed by a handful of bee stings as he is a gargantuan snake but theres an unnatural modernity to the dialogue hes given that can be trying at times. For the most part he blends in as well as the sole human among wild CG animals could possibly be expected to.On the subject of things seeming out of place there are also two songs from the 1967 film that are integrated into the story ""The Bear Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You."" (""Trust In Me"" plays over the credits).One works and one really doesnt. Murray makes ""The Bear Necessities"" fit into his laid-back existence as he hums and sings the song with Mowgli as they float down a serene river. ""I Wanna Be Like You"" however is awkward and clumsy -- a ditty of a song that comes out of nowhere and sucks the air out of the crucial climax. It makes no sense in the context of this world that Walkens mob-boss ape would just break into song. And if he did it definitely wouldnt be this song.Indeed much of the movies third act feels more like a checklist than plot advancement and the emotional arc lives up to neither its source material nor the beauty of the visuals. Still ""The Jungle Book"" is one of the stronger of Disneys live-action adaptations.

(  / Walt Disney Pictures) Panthers and tigers and bears. Oh my. The beloved 1967 Disney cartoon classic ""The Jungle Book"" takes on a dazzling live-action-ish life in Jon Favreaus adaptation a visual wonderment of color texture movement and spectacular animal life. Brought to the screen with computergenerated animation the Indian jungle of Rudyard Kiplings original stories glimmers and shines here with each fern frond and dappled glade enticing the viewer further into its primal depths. (Think ""Babe"" meets ""The Life of Pi"" meets ""Avatar."") The ethic of exacting detail extends especially to the charismatic mammals who populate the river banks mangroves and monkey kingdoms of a land that looks enchanted and startlingly real. Whether its the sleek glistening coat of the panther Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley) or each individual hair painstakingly undulating on a she-wolf and her pups every inch of ""The Jungle Book"" pulses with life grace and authenticity. Even when this idyllic world turns ugly its a thing of rare beauty. That even goes for Shere Khan (Idris Elba) the wounded perpetually enraged tiger and arch villain of the film who makes it his life work to hunt down a little boy named Mowgli who has been raised by wolves since he was abandoned in the jungle as a baby. Played by Neel Sethi the only human being seen in ""The Jungle Book"" Mowgli is an ecstatically dirty feral child given to howling with his canine brothers and competing with his protector Bagheera on swooping foot-races through the tree-tops. When Shere Khan sets his threatening sights on Mowgli -- convinced that the child will grow into a destructive marauding adult -- its decided that Mowgli should return to his ""own kind"" a journey fraught with untold physical and psychic dangers. (Like ""Zootopia"" ""The Jungle Book"" posits the animal kingdom as a peaceable metaphor for pluralism and tolerance from which homo sapiens know-it-alls have much to learn.) Mowgli and King Louie (voiced by Christopher Walken). (Walt Disney Pictures) Mowgli and Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kinglsey). (Walt Disney Pictures) Filmed with dynamism and propulsive energetic flair ""The Jungle Book"" allows viewers the vicarious pleasure of sidling up to magnificent (sometimes mangy) beasts as if they were household pets. Even when the movie takes on the episodic repetitive contours of a typical chase film -- including some genuinely terrifying fight sequences and a couple of potentially upsetting deaths -- the visual environment is so marvelously transporting that plot barely matters. Fans of the 1967 cartoon will be waiting for their favorite characters to show up which they do complete with musical numbers. In the midst of an otherwise traumatizing story Bill Murray provides his signature slightly snide comic relief as the honey-loving bear Baloo (so realistic here he looks freshly imported from the ""Revenant"" set) while Christopher Walken seems to channel both Marlon Brando and Louis Prima as King Louie a regal copper-colored gigantopithecus. Of course in the earlier film Louie was just an orangutan. But everythings bigger and brighter and more believable in this iteration of ""The Jungle Book"" which derives much of its pleasure from the silky vocal performances of Kingsley Elba Lupita Nyongo Scarlett Johansson and in a heart-rending posthumous turn Garry Shandling. Like all classic Disney productions ""The Jungle Book"" possesses its share of fear suffering and loss. But somehow the audience comes out whistling -- in this case with joy and quite a bit of awe. PG. At area theaters. Contains sequences of scary action and peril. 106 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Why not use it to make animals talk a noble pursuit if ever there was one? In director Jon Favreaus spirited lush adaptation of The Jungle Book--based loosely on Rudyard Kiplings stalwart fables with dashes of the 1967 Disney version tossed in--computer-generated animals talk sing saunter slink and slither around a live-action boy Mowgli (Neel Sethi). This ""man cub"" has been raised by wolves which are apparently a lot like 70s Berkeley types when it comes to parenting brimming with questions and quips Mowgli is a precocious hippie child in red underpants. Hes not totally carefree though. The meanest cat in the jungle Shere Khan (Idris Elba supplies his velvety malevolent purr) has vowed to kill him. The allies who gather round include the wise panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley in full master-thespian mode) and lover-of-life sloth bear Baloo (a fabulous Bill Murray--his voice sounds the way flannel pjs feel). If it all sounds a little too calculated--it is. Yet somehow this Jungle Book works because Favreau has both a sense of humor and a sense of spectacle. Even in 3-D the colors--a riot of jades cobalts and singing-canary yellows--are vibrant. And where else can you see an obsessive-compulsive porcupine counting every stone he passes or a silky she-snake with a vocabulary of seductive sinister sibilants (voiced by Scarlett Johansson using every s in her name and more)? Shes Eve and the devil rolled into one. The Jungle Book the movies credits tell us was made entirely in downtown Los Angeles. It may be an urban product but theres still wildness in its heart.

Just wow.The movie isnt simply visually sumptuous -- which it is by the way. The films lush jungle setting is so richly immersive and all-encompassing you feel that if you reached out and touched an on-screen river your hand would get damp. In other words if youre wavering between seeing the regular edition or the 3-D go for the latter.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Disneys animated classic is remade as a live-action movie with stunning special effects and the voices of stars such as Bill Murray Idris Elba Scarlett Johansson Ben Kingsley and the late Garry Shandling. VPCBut technical hoopla alone cant make a viewer emotionally invest in a movie if theres no soul there. And with the studios tendency to mine every last penny out of its properties theres no hiding the film is very much a product (one can already start visualizing potential Disneyland rides inspired by the movie). But thanks to the nicely layered characters and a near-perfect mix of action and merriment the movie feels wonderfully vivid and alive.The familiar tale taken from Rudyard Kiplings book and Disneys 1967 animated film follows 10-year-old Mowgli who was raised by wolves after the death of his father. Newcomer Neel Sethi plays the youngster and he is perfect Hes never self-consciously cute or cloying and seems wonderfully natural on screen.Mowgli (Neel Sethi) and Raksha share a moment in ""The Jungle Book."" (Photo Disney Enterprises)The latter bit really establishes the boys talents because he acts opposite panthers wolves snakes bears tigers and all kinds of talking wildlife and he helps a viewer buy into the whole thing. Thats not to downplay the amazing work by the visual-effects crew. Its often impossible to tell where the CGI ends and the real animals begin. The anthropomorphic creatures are uncannily naturalistic showing how far things have come since the days of ""Babe.""The grandly villainous tiger Shere Khan (voiced by Idris Elba) decides that Mowgli needs to be killed because a ""man cub"" will grow into a man and man brings danger into the jungle. Mowgli is escorted by a protective panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley beautifully serene) to a human village but the two become separated along the way and the boys adventures really begin.An encounter with a hypnotic snake (voiced by Scarlett Johansson as a seductive charmer) is almost deadly but a rescue by the lovably lazy bear Baloo sets up the movies most delightful section as the two team up and become fast friends.Mowgli (Neel Sethi) learns ""The Bare Necessities"" from his pal Baloo in ""The Jungle Book."" With Bill Murray voicing Baloo its sure to be a fun lesson. (Photo Disney Enterprises)It was a genius move to have Bill Murray provide Baloos voice; his off-kilter delivery adds a cutting humor the movie may have been missing. Baloo asks Mowgli if he knows any songs and the boy recites the wolfs creed ""Thats not a song"" Baloo announces. ""Thats propaganda"" You need someone like Murray to make that line snap and he does.Speaking of songs Baloo and Mowgli break into ""The Bare Necessities"" while drifting in the river a delightful homage to the original film. The old Louis Prima stomper ""I Wanna Be Like You"" also is reprised this time with an intimidating orangutan (Christopher Walken) subbing for Prima. Both numbers are fun and add levity to the film which is darker than the animated version but never overbearingly so.Bagheera keeps an eye on Mowgli (Neel Sethi) in ""The Jungle Book."" (Photo Disney Enterprises)Jon Favreau who also helmed the kid favorite ""Elf"" knows how to hit just the right tone. The movie is thrilling and at times creepy (again that Johansson sequence) but theres plenty of humor and warmth. Its truly a family film in that it entertains all ages; parents wont be checking their watches to see when things are going to wind up.Everything climaxes with a dazzling battle in the treetops as Mowgli faces off against Shere Khan. The characters swoop and soar there is fire on the ground below and everyone on screen is holding their breath.Even better The audience is too.Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

Share Tweet Special effects take pride of place in Jon Favreaus The Jungle Book an adaptation of Rudyard Kiplings Mowgli stories that is as technically accomplished as it is thinly conceived. A paean to the harmony of nature created almost entirely in digital space without a single real animal landscape or tree Favreaus fantasy is hampered by a talent-show moppet Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi) and by difficulties of translation; produced as a remake of Disneys popular animated musical it often struggles to make a place of its own amid the callbacks. (""The Bare Necessities"" the earlier films best-known song gets a tossed-off sequence.) Yet as a display of effects know-how it has undeniable allure. Talking animals have never looked so good which is a bigger feat than it sounds. The Jungle Book renders its entire animal cast digitally including the ones that dont speak. Its jungle is a complete simulacrum Everything from the birds to the leaves is artificial which means that nothing can ever stand out as unreal. The ironic exception is Sethis manic Mowgli mugging on partial sets against blue screen; in a digital world realized by a dream team of effects studios the one real thing seems fake. Critically Favreau and his effects artists and cast avoid making the animals too anthropomorphic. The performances often seem intentionally limited pitched within the reduced expressive ranges of wolves panthers and snakes while the most human-like of the animals--the ape King Louie original to the Disney version--gets the clipped off-beat voice of Christopher Walken. As in the earlier Disney version the story comes mostly from ""Mowglis Brothers"" the most adapted of the Mowgli fables with pieces pulled here and there from both volumes of the The Jungle Book. As always theres the boy Mowgli raised by wolves in the wilds of India and helped by the panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) and later the sloth bear Baloo (Bill Murray). A drought brings a truce between the predators and prey of the jungle as well as the returning threat of the Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba speaking in a perpetual roaring snarl) who warns that all humans are dangerous. Justin Marks screenplay makes the conflict strictly environmentalist (i.e. ""Can Mowglis human ingenuity help the jungle?"") taking away much of the source materials potent wistfulness.The Jungle Book doesnt offer the boys origins right away instead placing them in a hypnotic vision offered by the python Kaa (Scarlett Johansson); as the simulated camera crawls toward Kaas eye it transforms into a cavern opening lit by a torch. Its one of two imaginatively staged moments in the film the other being the introduction of King Louie--here reinvented as a gigantopithecus an extinct giant ape--as a massive hairy hand emerging from the shadows of a ruined temple. If its possible to pinpoint the major shortcoming of this Jungle Book its that its more impressively realized than imagined. Given the freedom of an almost completely artificial space Favreau keeps the camerawork lighting and editing as realistic as the animal fur. Unlike in say Avatar there are no moments of weightless perspective; perhaps what makes The Jungle Book so convincing--so effective as simulation--is that the camera never defies an audiences expectations of how a real camera moves even though its not always a real camera or how real animals look and even though there are no real animals. The most visually striking sequence is ironically the end credits presented as a series of pop-out book pages. The movie strives for photorealism showcasing the freedom of technology while curbing all of its expressive potential.

Photo Disney AP Favreaus Jungle Book is vibrant powerful storytelling 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Its easy to feel cynical when summer is coming and an old movie is resurrected to make a grab for the contents of a new generations wallet. When there was absolutely nothing wrong the first time whats the point of a reboot except to please stockholders and frustrate old-school purist filmgoers? That feeling will last a maximum of five minutes into the new ""Jungle Book"" before you get lost in the blend of patient self-assured storytelling and technical excellence. Disneys live action retelling of its 1967 animated hit (loosely based on Rudyard Kiplings source material) proves that dated material can be made relevant again if you find a filmmaker with something new to say. Its a vibrant notably intense and powerful family movie. Disneys first attempt at ""The Jungle Book"" was a diversionary romp probably a sunnier response to the darker 1950s and 1960s animated classics that came before it and national and world events that made escapist entertainment a bigger commodity. The new ""Jungle Book"" is a film for our times more contemplative and willing to shine a light on what humankind is doing to the planet and to itself. Its also -- parents of young children take note -- a longer darker and much scarier film. Although deservingly rated PG there are parts that approach ""Lord of the Rings"" movie levels of intensity. Exploring fear But thats probably a response to something too. ""The Jungle Book"" director Jon Favreau grew up during a time when even Jim Henson could do frightening and the idea that its healthy for children to know and confront fear and not be sheltered is one of this movies exploration points. During a cinematic era of rapid-fire jokes an overload of characters and little thought about how it all holds together Favreaus movie is a throwback to a time when family films were built solidly around strong life lessons. ""The Jungle Book"" begins with ""man-cub"" Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi) being raised by wolves and a kindly panther (voiced by Ben Kingsley) but forced to leave his comfort zone because of the threat of vengeful Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba). The scarred predator is one of three menacing figures including python Kaa and King Louie (Christopher Walken) a more sinister and seemingly ""Godfather""-inspired version of the goofy orangutan voiced by Louis Prima in 1967. Just when the film needs some levity badly Bill Murray shows up as the voice of Baloo Mowglis carefree bear running buddy. The two songs from the 1967 movie that make it into the 2016 version -- Terry Gilkysons ""Bare Necessities"" and the Sherman brothers ""I Wanna Be Like You"" -- are the two you want to hear. (Murrays version of ""Bare Necessities"" is his best vocal work since he added lyrics to the ""Star Wars"" theme on ""Saturday Night Live"" in the 1970s.) Theres a wonderful vibe throughout ""The Jungle Book"" as if there was enthusiasm and cooperation between the director cinematographer writers voice talent and especially the special effects crew. The work by FX house MPC with help from Weta Digital includes stunning artistry at every turn all in service of the storytelling. Its amazing to think that throughout this nearly two-hour film there is just one flesh-and-blood character who spends more than a few seconds onscreen and hes arguably among the least defined. Seamless animation effects Each of MPC and Wetas digital creations crafts its own performance and is never a distraction. Its like a whole film with that amazing bear from ""The Revenant""; youll constantly ask yourself whats real and whats not before forgetting and letting it all blend together into the narrative. The animation and effects work is seamless never better than when the hypnotic eye of python Kaa (Scarlett Johansson inspired casting) is used as a window to fill in the backstory for Mowgli and Shere Khans rivalry. I went to a critics screening in Imax 3-D and ""The Jungle Book"" is worth the extra expense for the improved audio as much as for the visuals. As far as anyone outside of an actual sound mixer can identify elite sound mixing this film seems to have it. The last word goes to Favreau whose best work (""Iron Man"" and ""Elf"") has arguably been associated with those films lead actors more than the director. ""The Jungle Book"" proves hes a superb director with a Robert Zemeckis level of mainstream movie versatility able to connect with his audience through different genres and with diverse technical challenges. This may be Favreaus best achievement -- taking a beloved film guided by Walt Disney himself and crafting something distinct and memorable.

"The Jungle Book review Mowgli and his wild charming pack are back - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Jungle Book review Mowgli and his wild charming pack are back Trailer The Jungle Book Trailer for the new Jon Favreau film ""The Jungle Book"" Trailer for the new Jon Favreau film ""The Jungle Book"" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Blanche DuBois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" said it first and best ""I dont want realism. I want magic"" Maybe its the Blanche in me who prefers magic to realism in certain types of fairy tales but I have a hard time loving any movie dominated by ultra-crisp photorealistic animation designed to look real not animated. That sort of realism often looks and feel misguided slightly clinical. And its a substantial caveat when it comes to Disneys new live-(ish) action version of ""The Jungle Book.""That said The movies pretty good. Director Jon Favreaus voice cast for the animals is tiptop for starters from Bill Murrays sloth bear Baloo to Idris Elbas adversarial tiger Shere Khan. Theres a real person on screen too; Neel Sethi plays Mowgli. This week Disney announced plans for a ""Jungle Book 2"" so clearly the studios bullish or going ape or pick your own animal metaphor regarding the future of the man-cub and his digitally imagined Indian jungle habitat.RELATED MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR The general contours of this new ""Jungle Book"" belong to Disneys 1967 animated musical. Other obvious inspirations include Rudyard Kiplings 1890s stories and no less crucial Disneys 1994 smash ""The Lion King."" The latters a steady source of various images and ideas here from a ghoulish boneyard to a suspenseful stampede to a guilt-tripping feline villain messing with the head of the young protagonist.Screenwriter Justin Marks plotting is more elaborate than the 67 edition but the story remains pleasingly episodic. Raised by strong and proud wolf parents voiced by Lupita Nyongo and Giancarlo Esposito Mowgli must contend with Shere Khans mission of vengeance (he was scarred for life by the boys fire-wielding father as we learn via flashback) and a jungle full of creatures who do not always have Mowglis best interests at heart.Two songs from the 67 animated film sneak their way in enlivening the bland grandeur of composer John Debneys score. Murray gets to sing ""The Bare Necessities"" while Christopher Walken as the ""jungle VIP"" orangutan King Louie lends an air of the weary mobster offering protection for a fee. The staging of his song ""I Wanna Be Like You"" doesnt bring out the best in director Favreaus visual instincts; its all chaos and scrambling. But elsewhere Favreaus fundamental decency and relatively light touch serve him well. He has a knack for straight-ahead pacing and for tightening the screws (the movie is 81 percent life-and-death peril and 19 percent comic relief) without being maniacal about it.

(Disney) Kiplings poem ""The Law of the Jungle"" is quoted twice ""The strength of the pack is the wolf/And the strength of the wolf is the pack."" The photorealistic mudslides and such are impressive in their fashion.

EntertainmentMovies The Jungle Book swings from one stunning scene to another Originally published April 14 2016 at 1200 am Updated April 14 2016 at 151 pm ""The Jungle Book"" A breathtaking dash through the forest featuring newcomer Neel Sethi as Mowgli and the voices of Bill Murray Scarlett Johansson Christopher Walken Idris Elba and Ben Kingsley. 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Stick around through the end credits of Jon Favreaus enjoyable live-action (sort of) remake of Rudyard Kiplings ""The Jungle Book"" set in the wilds of India and smile at this cheeky note ""Filmed in downtown Los Angeles."" The film combines a sole human actor (newcomer Neel Sethi as young Mowgli) with CG-created animals and digitally executed environments. Is it visually believable? Yes -- to the point where you might find yourself brushing away flies like those water buffalo -- and often thrilling too. (A parenthetical pause for a way-too-often-repeated rant I saw this movie in IMAX 3D. The IMAX is swell the 3D entirely unnecessary. I suspect that in 2D the film would look even better -- a little less blurry during chase scenes for example. And itll save you a few bucks.) Movie Review    The Jungle Book with Neel Sethi and the voices of Bill Murray Ben Kingsley Idris Elba Lupita Nyongo Scarlett Johansson Giancarlo Esposito Christopher Walken. Directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by Justin Marks based on the books by Rudyard Kipling. 106 minutes. Rated PG for some sections of scary action and peril. Several theaters. This ""Jungle Book"" is a Disney product and consequently joined at the hip to the beloved animated 1967 version -- and yes this one includes a couple of songs youll recognize. (Another upcoming non-Disney film version of the Kipling tales called ""Jungle Book"" without the ""The"" and directed by Andy Serkis arrives in theaters in 2018.) Bring very small or sensitive children though at your peril The animal action -- particularly the python Kaa and the vicious fights involving the tiger Shere Khan -- is at times quite scary.

(""My bad"" murmurs a porcupine -- voiced in his final film by comedian Garry Shandling who died last month.) While Sethi isnt exactly a nuanced actor (special effects can take you only so far) hes a charmer and his joy while careening through the jungle like its his own personal theme-park ride is infectious. The film moves us swiftly from one breathtaking scene to another a dramatic mudslide; a climb up a near-vertical rock face (by a bear whod really rather take a nap); a fairy-tale-misty lagoon where water blends seamlessly with sky. And the voice acting is terrific particularly Idris Elbas darkly threatening Shere Khan and Scarlett Johanssons sibilantly sinister Kaa. (""Trussssst in me"" she hisses; brrrr.) And Bill Murray and Christopher Walkens jaunty jazzy renditions of respectively Baloo the bear singing ""The Bare Necessities"" and King Louie the ape warbling ""I Wanna Be Like You"" are ... well worth the ticket price right there. Youll be endlessly humming them both the next day. Dont ask me how I know this. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

Photo Credit Disney advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Disney retells the story of the man-cub Mowgli using live action and computer-generated animals.CAST Neel Sethi Bill Murray Ben Kingsley Scarlett JohanssonRATED PG (Action-violence and intense scenes)LENGTH 146BOTTOM LINE Stunning animation and big-screen thrills but be warned that this is a much scarier movie than the animated 1967 version. Rudyard Kiplings ""The Jungle Book"" like Jonathan Swifts ""Gullivers Travels"" has become a childrens classic thanks to abridgment. Surely few children know that the hardy adventurer Lemuel Gulliver winds up an insane recluse or that the man-cub Mowgli destroys the human village that takes him in. Disneys 1967 adaptation of ""The Jungle Book"" figured out how and where to truncate Kiplings narrative without completely diluting it. That strategy along with a roster of irresistible songs (many by the Sherman brothers) and a stellar voice cast (Sebastian Cabot as the dignified panther Bagheera Louis Prima as the antic orangutan King Louie) made ""The Jungle Book"" one of Disneys liveliest and most beloved animated films. advertisement | advertise on newsday Disneys new version is different -- darker scarier and much more real. Mowgli the boy raised by wolves is played by a live actor newcomer Seth Neeli while the jungles other inhabitants are computer-generated creations. These are not cartoons but photorealistic beasts with shoulder blades that undulate under heavy fur and lungs that expand and contract. When Mowglis guardian Bagheera first speaks in Ben Kingsleys voice the effect is startling -- it can talk -- and takes some getting used to. Visually stunning (the 3-D might be worth the premium) and beautifully directed by Jon Favreau ""The Jungle Book"" takes pains to set itself apart from the freewheeling animated film and mostly succeeds. Scarlett Johansson turns Kaa the python into a femme fatale; Baloo the bear (Bill Murray) is less a bohemian than a scam artist; King Louie is now a psychotic behemoth with the voice of Christopher Walken. The low resonant rumble of Idris Elba turns the tiger Shere Khan into a truly spine-tingling villain. For all that ""The Jungle Book"" cant fully wipe the slate clean. It refuses to part with the best 1967 songs -- Baloos ""The Bare Necessities"" Louies ""I Wanna Be Like You"" -- which means this intense adventure film is also a kinda-sorta musical. Most crucially the movie ends with a narrative cop-out that robs Kiplings story of its emotional power and hard-won wisdom.

"Review The Jungle Book a beautiful movie for a new generation - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview The Jungle Book a beautiful movie for a new generationBy Tony Hicks thicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 04/13/2016 011539 PM PDTUpdated 04/13/2016 051352 PM PDT When Disney announced it was making a live-action version of ""The Jungle Book"" my first reaction was ""why?""My second was ""how?"" The second question has been more than answered. Disney made it work by assembling a huge team of very talented people focused on making an audience believe that animals can talk surrounding these creatures with magnificent scenery and using Jon Favreaus directorial talents to shape it all into a beautiful at times even breathtaking film. Some of the action scenes seem pulled from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (only with less sand). Its a movie worthy of being a high point of a childs cinematic memory bank especially for those who havent experienced the original 1967 animated classic. (L-R) Bagheera voiced by Ben Kingsley Baloo voiced by Bill Murray Neel Sethi as Mowgli and Raksha voiced by Lupita Nyongo in The Jungle Book. (Disney) ( Disney ) All of which pretty much answers the first question too -- for most of us. Framing Rudyard Kiplings classic tale of a boy raised by wolves and targeted by a terrible and mighty tiger with state of the art moviemaking gives a new generation the chance to define the story for itself. The original was an animated musical comedy; this version is a live action/CGI adventure that gets pretty harrowing at times. So yes there may be a tiny slice of joy missing in this ""Jungle Book"" for those who love the original version which was magical in its own very different ways.Advertisement Still Disney did pretty much everything right here. Favreau and screenwriter Justin Marks created a winning foundation and Disney certainly cast the right voice actors. Ben Kingsley is perfect as the noble-if-stuffy black panther Bagheera whos intent on taking the orphaned boy Mowgli away from the wolf pack that raised him and delivering him to the man-village of his people.Idris Elba brings an edge to the powerful nasty Shere Khan who has returned to his former hunting grounds and carries some nasty scars and an appetite for revenge from a previous encounter with humans. When he discovers the wolf pack is harboring a man cub he demands the child be turned over to him. That prompts Mowgli and Bagheera to flee and in the ensuing journey Mowgli nearly gets eaten by the giant snake Kaa (an underwhelming Scarlett Johansson) and encounters Baloo the fun-loving bear played by Bill Murray.Murray plays essentially Bill Murray in a bear suit which has its moments but also seems a little weird at times. Watching a bear that looks like a real bear constantly crack wise without the appropriate cartoonish facial expressions creates a disconnect and seems to be one of the few challenges that Favreau couldnt overcome. Thats not a deal beaker though because this movie belongs to 12-year-old Neel Sethi who couldnt be a better Mowgli. The kid spends the entire movie having to imagine the CGI characters hes interacting with and he nails it -- the physicality the compassion the wonder. Its all there.But for at least one big scene everyone takes a back seat to Christopher Walkens King Louis a giant menacing king of the apes desperate for the secret of fire. Walken is more like a New York mob boss than the swingin Louis Prima from the original; he engages in near self-parody while singing ""I Wanna Be Like You."" It works even if it doesnt measure up to the 1967 version still one of Disneys greatest musical scenes.The epic climax features an angry take-charge Mowgli having a final confrontation with Shere Khan using the ""tricks"" that are part of his human nature that his wolf family discouraged him from exploring. Favreaus direction shines here though things can get a bit intense for younger kids. Rarely do I believe a film needs to be 3-D but ""The Jungle Book"" is different. Its too rich and gorgeous not to be. For the first time I ducked my face into the seat next to me when something seemingly came flying off the screen. Any movie that can involuntarily bring you out of your seat has to be good.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67The Jungle Book    Rating PG (for some sequences of scary action and peril)Cast Bill Murray Neel Sethi Ben Kingsley Idris Elba Christopher Walken Scarlett Johansson Lupita Nyongo Director Jon FavreauRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesOpens April 15Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES A Game of Thrones spin-off?

As the end credits proudly proclaim the picture was ""filmed in downtown Los Angeles"" which means this jungle is comprised of heaps of green-screen sets and motion-capture technology.With the exception of Mowgli (played by Neel Sethi) the orphan boy raised by wolves everything you see in The Jungle Book is animated which is a marked difference from Disneys previous pillagings of its vaults. Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland the Sleeping Beauty-remake Maleficent and Kenneth Branaghs Cinderella all piled on the special effects too. But those movies justified their existences beyond brand-name recognition regardless of their quality They were driven by artistry not marketing.The Jungle Book is driven by computers. The movie which has been earnestly directed by Jon Favreau using every conceivable tool in the big-budget special effects arsenal boasts the most photorealistic grass and trees and skies since James Camerons Avatar. There are shots in which the movie could pass for a nature documentary even though its set in a world in which almost every animal speaks perfect English. But the illusion doesnt gel Favreau nails the small details but whiffs on the overall picture. The better these talking beasts look the more the film resembles a gorgeous screen saver. You admire The Jungle Book but you cant lose yourself in it.No matter how fearsome the vengeful tiger Shere Khan looks youre chucked out of the film the moment the beast starts spouting threats in Idris Elbas menacing dulcet baritone. You would think watching Baloo the bear singing The Bare Necessities with Bill Murrays voice would be fun -- it should be fun -- until you actually see it. Instead of turning the song into a showstopper Favreau throws it away as if he were fulfilling an embarassing obligation. The same goes for I Wanna Be Like You sung by Christopher Walkens simian King Louie; you have to wait for the end credits for the tune to get its proper due. The musical numbers are a huge part of the legacy of the 1967 cartoon which was directed by longtime Disney animator Wolfgang Reitherman (The Bare Necessities was nominated for an Oscar).But proper song-and-dance numbers are beyond the reach of this sombre serious Jungle Book A quest for honeycombs to feed Baloos voracious appetite is about as comical as things get. Whimsy has no place in a self-important movie trying to sell the illusion of anthropomorphic animals that hold grudges and exact revenge -- including murder -- like humans do. The film feels like a step back from the two Babe films Fury Roads George Miller produced and directed in the 1990s which brought a talking pig to life in cruder but infinitely warmer fashion. Those movies were filled with the sorts of hair-raising adventures that are a hallmark of classic childrens literature They were genuinely enchanting.The Jungle Book has its moments -- the panther Bagheera voiced by Ben Kingsley the python Kaa voiced by Scarlett Johansson and a funny porcupine voiced by the late Garry Shandling are all memorable creations -- but the overall film feels cold and mechanical befitting a movie that was made primarily because technology made it possible. The Jungle Book wont be the last Disney cartoon to get a live-action do-over (Beauty and the Beast is due next year) and its not even the last CGI-adaptation of Rudyard Kiplings source novels (a non-musical version directed by mo-cap king Andy Serkis arrives in 2018 with Cate Blanchett and Benedict Cumberbatch Bale providing some of the voices). The movie is practically guaranteed to be a mammoth hit because who can resist those ads? But here is a rare breed of Disney family film one destined to be watched once and then never again not even on long road trips.Cast Neel Sethi.

An updated version monkeys around with the Disney classic. Director Jon Favreau. (145). PG Violence. Area theaters. Disneys latest take on ""The Jungle Book"" has the bare necessities but not much more. Sure it reprises that hit song from the original 1967 cartoon here mumbled by Bill Murray. And it boasts the same basic story about Mowgli the human foundling raised by wolves. But with director Jon Favreau replacing the first films animated animals with CGI ones and Louis Primas swingin baboon now being voiced by -- Christopher Walken? -- the 21st Century version has lost a lot of the childlike charm of its predecessor. The overly realistic special effects bare some of the blame. Now that Mowgli is a flesh-and-blood child bearing the scrapes and scars of battle its hard to get lost in the innocent magic. Now that the animals are made with software not brushes and paint its difficult to just sit back and wonder. (From l.) Ben Kingsley Bill Murray and Lupita Nyongo lend their voice talents to The Jungle Book as talking animals. (DISNEY) Its a relief when Murray shows up as Baloo the bear projecting his usual sloppy slothful persona. And although she doesnt get enough to do Scarlett Johansson adds her patented vocal slinkiness as Kaa the snake. Walkens turn as King Louie a prickly primate who seems to be doing a Marlon Brando impression is bizarre though -- even for Walken. Is it Brando from ""The Godfather"" or Brando from ""Apocalypse Now""? Walken cant seem to decide. Idris Elba earns his stripes as the villainous Bengal tiger Shere Khan (his second Disney talking-animal movie this year after ""Zootopia."") And plucky little Neel Sethi is easy to take as Mowgli the Indian boy with the tiger on his trail. Christopher Walkens King Louie is way too bananas. (Disney) Newcomer Neel Sethi stars in The Jungle Book. (Disney) Except Favreau seems to have forgotten who will be in the audience. Talking-animal flicks are usually made for the 8-and-under crowd but Favreau piles on the blood and thunder like hes making another ""Iron Man"" sequel jumping from fight scene to fight scene. The film starts with a scary chase fills out its middle with a couple of killings throws in a catastrophe or two and ends with a wildfire to rival the one in ""Bambi."" Its too scary for little kids not sophisticated enough for adults; noisy when it should be nice savage when it should be sweet. And in the end all that bungle in the ""Jungle"" becomes just a little hard to bear.

In addition to the creative resurrection of Star Wars the seemingly unstoppable commercial might of the Marvel films and the by-now taken-for-granted genius of Pixar the Mouse House has less noisily been rummaging around in its celluloid closet and giving some of its more mothball-scented animated classics up-to-the-minute live-action makeovers. Last year director Kenneth Branagh splashed a fresh coat of candy-colored paint onto Cinderella (with a huge assist from Cate Blanchetts venomous wicked stepmother).  Now its The Jungle Books turn in the rotation - and whodathunkit it turns out to be one of the biggest surprises of 2016. A faithful albeit more mature reboot of Disneys animated 1967 classic (well ""classic"" actually seems too charitable of a word when measured against Pinocchio Dumbo and Snow White...lets call it a ""second-tier classic"") The Jungle Book stars the endearing 12-year-old Neel Sethi as Mowgli an irrepressibly chatty ""man-cub"" who was raised in the wild by a pack of wolves led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyongo) after a fatherly black panther named Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) found him as an abandoned toddler. Mowgli is reared according to the communal code of the wolfpack and lives in jungle harmony until a snarling vengeful tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba all East London-accented menace) comes looking for him. It turns out that Shere Khan was burned and scarred by the ""red flower"" (the animals term for fire) once wielded by Mowglis father. He wants the boy handed over as tooth-for-a-tooth payback otherwise all the jungle critters will get a dark tutorial about the circle of life pronto. In order to protect the boy from the villainous Shere Khan Bagheera decides to return him to his own people. But along the way things go awry (as they do). Mowgli gets caught in the chest-crushing embrace of a giant snake named Kaa (Scarlett Johansson seductively slithery) he falls in with a lazy honey-loving con-artist bear Baloo (Bill Murray at his wry what-me-worry comic-relief best) and runs afoul of a tyrannical Kong-sized ape named Louie (Christopher Walken channeling both Don Corleone and Jabba the Hutt). Theres also the late Garry Shandling lending his frantic pipes to a neurotic porcupine. And theyre all perfect - not just in their voices but also in the way that whats coming out of their mouths syncs up with the way their mouths move. Its the first talking-animal movie Ive seen where CGI seamlessly bridges the uncanny gap between fantasy and reality. Its also one of the few 3-D movies that actually benefits from being in 3-D. Directed by Iron Mans Jon Favreau The Jungle Book is a tender and rollicking fable that manages to touch on some grown-up themes about mans destructive power and the loss of youthful innocence without losing sight that its first and foremost a gee-whiz kids adventure - though definitely one thats a bit too scary and intense for younger kids. My only beef with the film - and its a minor one - is that it felt the need to be too faithful to its Disney predecessor. In particular a pair of musical numbers (Baloos ""Bear Necessities"" and Louies ""I Wanna Be Like You"") that seem to come out of nowhere and stop the films momentum on a dime. Theyre fine but they feel like they were shoe-horned into the film for soundtrack licensing purposes or as a sop to old-school mom-and-dad Jungle Book fans in the theater. Favreaus Jungle Book is such a wall-to-wall pleasure his song-and-dance interludes are an unnecessary distraction. With a movie this great and this dazzling the last thing you need to do is break out the jazz-hands and turn it into the Country Bear Jamboree.

Richard Roeper richardroeper | email In the wrong hands the 2016 version of ""The Jungle Book"" could have played like the longest Super Bowl commercial in history what with all those realistic-looking animals conversing with a little boy. Come on. Unless youre the littlest of little kids theres something a bit goofy about wolves and a tiger and a panther and a bear and dozens of other creatures chatting it up in British or American accents and then suddenly reverting to growls and howls and roars -- but thanks to director Jon Favreaus visionary guidance and some of the most impressive blends of live-action and CGI weve yet seen ""The Jungle Book"" is a beautifully rendered visually arresting take on Rudyard Kiplings oft-filmed tales. Every drop of rain every cracking tree branch every swaying tree and (most impressively) every jungle creature in the film looks amazingly real -- and yet this entire movie was filmed in a studio in downtown Los Angeles. Thats a jaw-dropper right there. The only character in ""The Jungle Book"" who is NOT a creation of special-effects movie magic is the boy-cub Mowgli who is played by Neel Sethi an actual human child who is not the most subtle of young actors but does a pretty fair job of ""interacting"" with co-stars that exist only in CGI form and via voice-overs from a roster of big-name stars. Sir Ben Kingsley provides narration and life lessons as the black panther Bagheera who found the orphaned Mowgli deep in the jungle when Mowgli was just a toddler cub and united the boy with a pack of wolves including the stern but kind father figure Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and the loving mother figure Raksha (Lupita Nyongo.) When the ferocious and fearsome tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) literally sniffs out the boy-cub he announces to the animal kingdom he WILL one day kill the boy. Rather than put his wolf family at risk Mowgli decides its time for him to leave the jungle and join a village of humans -- and off we go with Mowgli on a series of adventures that will be familiar to anyone who has read Kipling or has seen any of ""The Jungle Book"" movies most notably the 1967 Disney box office smash. Scarlett Johansson is a hissing seductive hypnotic Kaa a snake in every sense of the word. Her ""Lost in Translation"" pal Bill Murray gets most of the big laughs in the film as Baloo the big ol bear who cons Mowgli into helping him store up the honey supply but eventually becomes as loyal a friend as a boy-cub in the jungle could ever hope to know. Its a bittersweet moment to hear the voice of Garry Shandling providing additional comic relief as Ikki a porcupine that delights in every rock and twig he finds. And then theres Christopher Walken doing his Christopher Walken thing as King Louie the grotesque and oversized orangutan who ""welcomes"" Mowgli into his dark and forbidding lair with all the oily menace of Colonel Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now."" Walkens rendition of ""I Wanna Be Like You"" made famous by Louis Prima in the 1967 film might be amusing to adults (I found it a bit tedious) but will most likely have children fidgeting with their 3-D glasses waiting for the story to get moving again. (Murray sings another song from the 1967 film ""The Bare Necessities."" I realize generations of fans of that movie love those tunes but I didnt and I dont. If both musical numbers were excised from the film I dont think ""The Jungle Book"" would have missed a beat so to speak. In fact it might have made for a more exhilarating streamlined adventure.) There are some genuinely scary moments e.g. when Shere Khan puts a sudden and shocking end to a beloved character. The violence in the film is mostly implied but you might want to think twice before taking the very young. You dont want to give a 5-year-old 3-D nightmares do ya? Its amazing how CGI just keeps getting better and better. Just four years ago the Bengal tiger in ""Life of Pi"" was a jaw-dropping creation. In ""The Jungle Book"" the tiger the bear the wolves and hundreds of other animals are astonishingly original creations -- and they seem to have been plucked from an actual jungle albeit a jungle where bears and elephants and mice and water buffalo and turtles and panthers and friggin peacocks all share the same turf. Quite the ride. 1/2 Disney presents a film directed by Jon Favreau and written by Justin Marks. Running time 106 minutes. Rated PG (for some sequences of scary action and peril).

Disney and Jon Favreaus The Jungle Book reinvigorates an oft-told tale with star power technology and calculated charm. Its been billed as a live-action remake (its too good to be called a ""reboot"") of the 1967 Walt Disney animated classic based on Rudyard Kiplings 1894 stories. Of course Disney has already given us a live-action version in 1994 with Rudyard Kiplings The Jungle Book an Indiana Jones-ified take that bore little resemblance to either the animated film or the original tales. And perhaps the best Jungle Book out there might still be Alexander and Zoltan Kordas magical and odd 1942 film starring the young Indian actor Sabu; that one was even less faithful to Kipling. Over the years theres been a Russian adaptation an anime series a Chuck Jones cartoon plus a brace of sequels and sorta-sequels. Oh and apparently Warner Bros. is at this very moment working on its own iteration due in 2018.In other words theres no real need for another Jungle Book which makes this new ones job even harder. The story itself isnt too dramatically different from the familiar Disney animated film. Our hero Mowgli (Neel Sethi delightfully vivacious and chatty) is a young boy whos been raised by a family of wolves ever since the black panther Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley) found him abandoned in the woods. Living as a wolf isnt easy Mowgli grows up slowly cant resist the temptation to use tools and has to will into instinct the things that wolves just know like never to stray from the pack. Togetherness is the wolves mantra They gather to recite the Law of the Jungle (""The strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack"") in the evening and Bagheeras voiceover tells us ""If he was going to survive he was going to need a people -- a people to protect him."" Thats not people but a people. Superheroes be damned this is a communitarian blockbuster.That communal impulse is threatened when loner tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) arrives and demands that Mowgli be turned over to him or else. The tigers vendetta is personal ""Does my face not remind you of what a grown man can do?"" he sneers displaying his scarred mug. To protect the wolves Bagheera agrees to take Mowgli back to a distant human village. Along the way Mowgli runs into Kaa the python (Scarlett Johansson) Baloo the bear (Bill Murray) and King Louie (Christopher Walken) a gigantopithecus lording over a small army of monkeys.In keeping with the spirit of Kipling the structure is largely episodic. That choice could result in tedium onscreen but it works here giving us ample opportunity to luxuriate in the casts star personas. Murrays bear is a riff on his usual scheming layabout; Johanssons snake vamps it up as she slithers and hypnotizes; and Walken gets to be a goofily intimidating Mob boss. (Louie was a character invented for the 1967 Disney version and was memorably voiced in that film by Louis Prima.) We even get some songs Walken reprises a revised version of the classic ""I Wanna Be Like You"" and Murray of ""The Bare Necessities.""But the true wonder of The Jungle Book lies in what might be called its very blockbuster-ness -- the way it fully immerses us in this world utilizing state-of-the-art effects (the talking emoting animals look amazing and real) and juggling levity menace and sweep. As a director Favreau has over the years proven himself adept at staying close to the action while still finding brief moments of pictorial grace; thats one reason why his Iron Man set the tone for the Marvel movie-verse.He does something similar here. As Mowgli runs through dense fields and forests the camera often stays so close to the boys point of view that we dont always see whats pursuing him -- a classic tactic Favreau and others probably learned from its most brilliant practitioner Steven Spielberg. But the film has a stirring storybook grandeur as well particularly in its rhapsodic portraits of animal togetherness which in turn helps sell all that dialogue about unity and the power of the pack.These franchise movies usually have to be all things to all viewers fun for the kids gritty for the grown-ups snarky for the teens. Very often that results in an inchoate sprawl of competing tones and set pieces. But The Jungle Book is fast and light. It manages to be just scary enough to make us feel the danger of solitude in the middle of a massive jungle but never indulgent or gratuitous. At one pivotal point Shere Khan kills a major character by biting into and then quickly casting the body off a cliff. It happens swiftly suddenly and without any melodrama You can imagine that the filmmakers and the studio dont want to upset younger viewers too much by focusing too much on death. And yet the offhand cruelty of this characters speedy dispatch has a real sting too. If only all blockbusters could be this exciting engrossing and beautiful.The Jungle Book Directed by Jon Favreau Walt Disney Pictures Opens April 15 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Bilge Ebiri Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Disneys live-action remake of The Jungle Book is a winner Who wanted a Disney remake of The Jungle Book? No one. Especially not one combining CGI with a real-life boy. But forget about your worries - this new version is the jungle VIP. Director Jon Favreau hasnt monkeyed around dipping into the 1967 cartoon for gags and fun and Rudyard Kiplings 1894 novel for darkness adding awe-and-wonder effects (I gasped as elephants appeared out of the mist in all their trumpeting majesty). Still it should come with a warning this is not safe n cuddly hug-a-tiger Disney (Twitter is already calling it ""The Revenant"" for kids). Twelve-year-old Neel Sethi (picked from over 2000 child actors) stars as Mowgli the boy raised by wolves. Credit to the filmmakers for adding female characters to the all-male line up with Lupita Nyongo playing Raksha the mother wolf who loves Mowgli as fiercely as her own and protects him when tiger Shere Khan stalks back into the jungle with designs on turning him into a man-cub morsel. Its wise panther Bagheera (voiced to perfection by Ben Kingsley) who decides Mowgli must return to his own kind. As a villain Shere Khan is up there with Scar from The Lion King and quite possibly baddie of the year. Voiced by Idris Elba (with his east London accent like Luther gone bad) this predator is all the more dangerous because hes at the end of his murderous shelf-life battle scarred gnarled a little mangy and capable of anything. Halfway through youre thinking the only thing missing here is the songs. Then in ambles Baloo the workshy slacker bear with the colossal rump and fondness for honey (voiced by Bill Murray) humming The Bare Necessities. Next oobie-do along comes the king of the swingers himself giant ape Louie - Christopher Walken drawling like a Brooklyn mob boss as he shakes down this kid Mowgli. The Jungle Book is not perfect. The story drifts a bit and the message is a little fuzzy. Is it about human destruction of the environment? Actually its most moving dealing with the end of childhood. Theyll ruin him says Baloo sadly as he escorts Mowgli to the man-village. Theyll make a man out of him. Still this Jungle Book has the bare necessities and then some.

What more could a boy ask for I wasnt expecting much from a movie I thought would be directed at kids but how wrong I was. I came out of the cinema happier than the 9 year old girl next to me. This was a wonderfully brilliant production and I have no idea where they managed to cast mowgli but he was so convincing in the show. Hats off to the amazing young lad. He has a bright future ahead of him. I was lucky enough to catch the 3D version of it and it is well worth the extra quid as you get the animals really leaping out at you. I definitely found myself reaching out to try to pat some of the animals this is a whole family show that would be a great day out for both kids and adults.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore4 days agoTara PTastemakerFeaturedAt the risk of sounding like a broken record I was apprehensive about the jungle book. Although it was never a childhood favourite in my experience mixing humans with CGI animals can lead to disastrous results. My fears were unfounded I was blown away. From the first moments the first bars of the familiar tune I was sucked into this fascinating world. The concept of a man-cub is so much more impactful with a real rather than an animated boy the interplay between man and nature all the more stark. There are moments of lighthearted humour but the film is characterised by darkness - by true enemies and surprising cruelty. It strikes an epic tone reminiscent of the best fantastical journeys weve seen on screen. The performances are wonderful - though the choice of Idris Elba for Sher Khan is jarring the London accent just not ringing true. This was the films biggest disappointment. Overall its eminently watchable and even verges on thought-provoking a true success for Disney. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 13 2016MandyGoTastemakerFeaturedBeing a huge fan of Disney classics I was apprehensive at the thought of our beloved Baloo and gang having CGI makeovers for The Jungle Book remake. With only one way to settle it I was pleasantly surprised by Jon Favreaus take on this iconic tale of animal adventure. When you consider that young Mowglis co-stars were non-existent during filming and hes the tender age of 12 little Neel Sethi did a pretty good job at bringing to life everyones favourite man-cub. Hats off to the casting crew for finding him - its certainly given his career a kick start The visual effects throughout the film were pretty spot on. Different animal characteristics were identified perfectly and really gave the film an authentic feel. I think the biggest shock for me was how dark the film comes across when not in its animated form. With that said apologies to row G in front for becoming victims of unintentional popcorn showers. On numerous occasions. I was surprised at how many times I jumped Its rated a PG - but I cant help but think it should have a 12A stamp on it the animal and human interaction was pretty frightening. That Shere Khan is a nasty piece of work There were certain voices that didnt seem natural to the animal it was expressing. I know that sounds ridiculous and I didnt ever imagine Id type those words in the same sentence but Idris Elba and Scarlett Johansson didnt seem to work as well as some of the others. Your favourite songs were there in the right places although the musical side of things didnt seem to be priority with this version. So if youre after a good sing-song download the Spotify playlist or get your hands on the soundtrack and let the music fill your journey to and from the cinema. Because I wouldnt want you or your vocal chords to be disappointed - and as any true Disney fan knows the fear is real.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 23 2016AnaelleTastemakerFeaturedI might be the only person on earth who feels this way but I have to say I was not overly impressed with this new Jungle Book. For me making a remake is only justified if you do it better and/or different - think Vanilla Sky that added so much to the original plot.The Jungle Book was not like that. The trailer made it look like it was an interesting new take on the Disney classic. A little darker a little more violent it felt like a more grown-up version. This could have been interesting. Instead it falls short. After a few instances where the movie differs slightly form the original (see the threatening massive King Louie or the crazy and murderous Shere Khan or Johansson playing Kaa) it follows the previous film to the letter even including the songs...Sure the CGI is breath-taking and sure its great to see the kids engaging with this old-time classic too. But by being too similar for me it doesnt justify the remake.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 18 2016Niomi HarrisTastemakerFeaturedI thoroughly enjoyed this and I would even consider going back and watching it all over again For those who remember it first time round its lovely to see that theyve stuck to the original story and whats great is that younger people can enjoy it for the first time round too. The 3-D and special effects is amazing and young Neel Sethi who plays Mowgli is a breath of fresh air- I predict big things to come in his future. The voices of Idris Alba and Ben Kingsley were a great casting however I didnt really like Scarlett Johannson as the snake- thats just my personal opinion. A great fun family film but with enough substance to make it enjoyable for adults too.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 30 2016Vishaal VTastemakerFeaturedExcellent film 3D works really well here and the story is well told. The animal characters are voiced brilliantly in particular Idris Elba as Sher Khan - genuinely scary even for fully grown adults Neel Sethi as Mowgli is also excellent especially when you consider all the scenes are shot with CGI animals. I assume it is much easier to act when there are other human actors you can feed off so Sethi does particularly well. The action scenes are a pleasure to watch and famous songs are executed very well. Basically - you need to see this film. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 29 2016Kirsty StastemakerFeaturedAbsolutely visionary in style graphics and entertainment/ Still has the heart and soul of the book and original film but more sophisticated with close attention to the characters. My favourite part is the King Louis stint. Fun for all the family but big kids with love the clever play on the original  a trip down memory lane absolutely worth embarking on and ironically the future of film has certainly been set a high barHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 24 2016Sarah GTastemakerFeaturedTook the whole family ages 53 -9 yesterday to see the 3D version and we all loved it I was particularly impressed with the quality and impact of the 3D. It really added something to the experience.I wondered how well Disney could take such a classic and make something new from it but they have succeeded. Ill put my hands up here my primary reason for going is cos Im an Idris Elba fangirl amp; he is tremendous as sher Khan but in truth all the cast are all great. The visuals of the animals and jungle also really convincing. I found it far more dramatic than I expected and nearly jumped out of my skin a few times.Jungle Book being a historical fable means there are some things that are difficult to translate to the modern day - like what the rights and wrongs are of human impact on the environment are quite difficult to wrap your head around. But Ive decided its meant to be childrens entertainment primarily so am not going to think too deeply about it all. The child actor is charming. If you liked the original film and like a bit of live action adventure then whats not to love about this film? Plus dont forget IDRIS ELBAHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 21 2016Tiago AlmeidaTastemakerFeaturedOh Mowgli how I missed youBreathtaking visually outstanding emotional scary and funny - what more do you need.The young actor that plays mowgli is very convincing and the CGI characters are absolutely amazing that could be confused with real animals.The story you should already know but if you dont you will love it.Kind regardsHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 20 2016TheMixedMedicTastemakerFeaturedLike most I was probably a little sceptical when it came to a CGI remake of eveyones favourite Disney classic however I reassure you that you will not be left disappointed. Although the life-like animation will have you constantly gripping the edge your seat in fear it will also reignite your favourite childhood memories in ways you couldnt imagine. Singing along to the Bear Necessities the way my grandfather used to I amused myself while briefly imagining what his reaction might be had been able to see such an incredibly vivid remake. Despite knowing the story so well the tension and childlike excitement is not lost on anyone with the help of a few twists and tweaks that make the script more similar to the original writings by Rudyard Kipling.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 18 2016Luisa GTastemakerFeaturedWhat a fabulous remake of a classic. Its hard to come close to an original sometimes but there is the possibility this one could be even better The graphics were just absolutely fantastic the storyline was lovely and the actors did a fantastic job portraying their animal counterparts.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 17 2016Jane G.TastemakerFeaturedI was concerned about the CGI since almost the entire movie is digital. The young actor who plays Mowgli did an amazing job. Such great effects Bill Murray as Baloo was priceless. The best treat was Christopher Walken as a mobster King Louie. To be honest it was just a bit slow here and there but well worth seeingHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 17 2016TommoderatorStaff WriterFeaturedHad the kids mesmerised from start to finish; and enough in it to keep the adults entertained too as you try and recall the various parts of the original. Stunning visuals and of course Christopher Walken can do no wrongHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 17 2016Alexandra LTastemakerFeaturedIm a big fan of Jon Favreau. I liked the first Iron Man I loved Chef and I think he always comes across as a great guy who enjoys his job amp; respects his profession. Im also a big fan of the original Jungle Book with its brilliant characters charming animation amp; earworm songs so the thought of a live action remake of the latter by the former was a-ok by me. Im sorry to say though it just didnt float my boat. Dont get me wrong it wasnt bad by any means. It just wasnt great. It was ok. It was fine. It was a passable way to spend a couple of hours in the cinema but I think wed all agree that ok fine amp; passable are not the greatest of compliments to a movie. Visually its fantastic. From the opening scene in which you can almost feel the tropical humidity pulse off the screen towards you to the introduction of such gorgeous creatures as the softly shaggy Akela and so-sleek-and-glossy-I-wanted-to-reach-out-and-stroke-him Bagheera theres not an inch of the screen that doesnt look alive and exciting with exceptional attention to detail. I greatly preferred the CGI characters to the lone human; Neel Sethis Mowgli was bright lively and athletic but a touch too stage-school for my liking. To be fair to him Im not sure this role could be played in any other way - its absolutely not a Jacob Tremblay from Room type child performance - but I was glad it didnt run for any longer than it did. Some of the recognisable actors voicing the characters work well - Sir Ben Kingsley is the perfect voice for the level-headed and powerful panther and the late great Garry Shandling brings to life my favourite character of all Ikky the porcupine who claims one stone rock amp; twig after another in a genius turn. Idris Elba who I loved as the buffalo police chief in Zootropolis was unfortunately nowhere near suave or wicked enough me as Shere Khan - Jeremy Irons Scar in The Lion King was far more genuinely evil - and he brought a roughness to the role that didnt match the scarred amp; mangled beauty of his physical character. I also found Bill Murray sadly lacking as Baloo; there was the sarcasm and gentle digging youd expect from him but not the bouncy jolliness of the original animated bear. Scarlett Johanssons melodic amp; hypnotic voice was an interesting twist on Kaa but I kind of missed the levity of the stupid lisping unintentionally comical original. For me this version is absolutely made for children. Well duh you might think as you roll your eyes at me its a kids story based on a kids cartoon and yeah I get that. However Id argue that most of the best animated and kids films of recent years have had something in them for the adults in the audience as well as the kids a smart humour that partners cleverly alongside the more obvious childrens jokes and this just didnt. I wouldnt go so far as to say I was bored but I sure wasnt having as much fun as the under 10s in my screening. I have a lot of trouble with Hollywoods ongoing obsession with remakes especially as some of the films they pick simply cant be bettered in my opinion and this film is a classic example of that; sure itll bring the story to a new generation but theres a part of me that kind of wishes that generation would just watch the original and see for themselves where the love for it came from.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-jungle-book-2016,200,thejunglebook(2016)39,thejunglebook(2016),timeout

(Commentary) Disney Plans Live-Action Movie About Snow Whites Sister The Avengers Love to Kiss Each Other in Age of Ultron Blooper Reel (Video) Josh Hutcherson Ben Kingsley to Star in Political Thriller Backstabbing for Beginners The tigers and the turtles talk in Jon Favreaus reimagining of the classic Disney cartoon - and the visual trickery satisfies both the eyes and the emotions Rudyard Kiplings ""man-cub"" Mowgli returns to the wild in ""The Jungle Book"" but this time hes got the latest in digital animation to bring his animal friends and enemies to vivid life. If The Walt Disney Company insists upon cranking out live-action remakes of its animated classics - which is neither an inherently good nor terrible idea - this time around theres an effort to accomplish visual feats that werent previously possible. This ""Book"" might lack the post-vaudeville razzamatazz of its predecessor but director Jon Favreau and a team of effects wizards plunge us into one of the big screens most engrossing artificial worlds since ""Avatar."" (Not to mention the most convincing conversational creatures since ""Babe."") I dont know where the fakery stops and the real animals waterfalls and veldts begin in this movie and I dont really want to. See Video The Jungle Book Trailer Scarlett Johansson Slithers Toward Mowgli in First Good Look at Disneys Live-Action Spectacular Its a testament to the total-immersion powers of ""The Jungle Book"" from its visual splendors to its sound design that the seams never show; even more impressive is the films use of its craft not merely to dazzle us but also to further its dramatic agenda. Its all well and good to believe that a boy is talking to the she-wolf who raised him but that illusion only matters if tears come to your eyes when they must part. Adapting the Kipling stories screenwriter Justin Marks (""Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li"") stays close to the path of the 1967 cartoon orphaned Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is found in the jungle by wise panther Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley) and raised by a pack of wolves led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyongo). Fearsome tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) whose face was disfigured by the ""red flower"" (humans call it fire) wielded by Mowglis father demands that the boy be turned over to him. Also Read Bill Murray Willing to Pay for Damages After Hurling Fans Phones Off Roof Police Say Bagheera tries to take Mowgli to the man-village but along the way the boy falls in with friendly hedonistic bear Baloo (Bill Murray) who must team up with Bagheera to save their human charge from ape king Louie (Christopher Walken) who wants that ""red flower"" for himself so that he can climb the evolutionary ladder. But while Mowgli is torn between his animal compatriots and his true home Shere Khans reign of terror demands a confrontation between boy and tiger. Favreau and legendary cinematographer Bill Pope (""The Matrix"" ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"") capture both the beauty and the danger of the jungle and the many perils Mowgli faces are genuinely thrilling from the seductive embrace of giant serpent Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) to the impending collapse of the giant stone temple that is Louies palace. The fine voice cast - including the late Garry Shandling as a neurotic porcupine - imbues these immortal characters with genuine personalities and eccentricities aided greatly by the animators who give the creatures such expressive eyes. (Go look at ""Mars Needs Moms"" or ""The Polar Express"" for a reminder of how dead eyes can sink your CG movie.) See Video Bill Murray Sings Bare Necessities With Young Jungle Book Co-Star If theres one element of ""The Jungle Book"" that doesnt quite play its Favreaus apparent reticence over the beloved songs from the 1967 version. He assumes not incorrectly that audiences will want to hear ""The Bear Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You"" but these tunes are included somewhat haphazardly Sethi (whos clearly adept at acting opposite tennis balls with eyelines drawn on them) and Murray warble the first verse of ""Necessities"" twice while Walken scats through a few lines of the latter. (Over the closing credits the song-and-dance man gets to cut loose on the whole thing.) The film would have been better served by either cutting the numbers altogether or by taking a full plunge. (Its a good sign that ""Dreamgirls"" director Bill Condon is doing the studios ""Beauty and the Beast"" remake which will no doubt give us all the songs from both the movie and stage versions.) Apart from that misstep however ""The Jungle Book"" delivers a coming-of-age tale that never gets lost in the thickets of the technology that made it possible. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Daily Edition Login to download The Jungle Book Film Review 900 AM PDT 4/3/2016 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Visually stunning and entirely engaging. TWITTER 4/15/2016 Jon Favreau directs the latest film rendition of the Rudyard Kipling classic with sophisticated CGI visuals and a starry voice cast. The beguilingly credible CGI rendering of real-life animals takes its biggest leap forward since Life of Pi in Disneys new telling of The Jungle Book. Exceptionally beautiful to behold and bolstered by a stellar vocal cast this umpteenth film rendition of Rudyard Kiplings tales of young Mowglis adventures amongst the creatures of the Indian jungle proves entirely engaging even if its ultimately lacking in subtext and thematic heft. Most Jungle Book big-screen adaptations have done very well at the box office -- the 1967 version the last animated film Walt Disney personally supervised was the second-biggest grosser of its year behind only The Graduate -- and this one will be no exception upon its April 15 release as it takes the baton from the studios fresher more original smash Zootopia. Nor will this be the last we hear of Mowgli Shere Khan Kaa and the others for a while. Warner Bros. live-action Jungle Book Origins directed by Andy Serkis and featuring the likes of Christian Bale Cate Blanchett Benedict Cumberbatch and Serkis himself as Baloo the bear started shooting a year ago and is set for release in October 2017. From the embracing opening image (extra effective in 3D) which smoothly backtracks from the Cinderella castle logo right into the jungle setting director Jon Favreau makes his new film instantly welcoming with its wonderfully detailed wilderness environment anyone would swear is real. It also provides clear dramatic orientation through the imposing voice of narrator Ben Kingsley in the guise of the black panther Bagheera who watches over orphaned Indian boy Mowgli (Neel Sethi whos limber energetic and a tad emphatic at times). The latter has been raised by wolves but can scamper through the trees with the assurance of a monkey and is able to survive partly by virtue of a truce that allows all animals to gather around a watering hole without fear of becoming lunch for their natural predators. Justin Marks script may veer rather too far from reality in depicting its jungle creatures as fundamentally peaceable apart from the menacing tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba oozing malignant nuance) and Kaa an enormous tree-dwelling serpent given hypnotically seductive voice by Scarlett Johansson. To be sure Disney has not dropped the genres sure-fire comic-relief staples (a baby elephant a cutesy little porcupine) but the exceptional photographic realism lends the work a real-world gravity that sets it leagues apart from the strenuously ingratiating kid-pic conventions in the likes of the Madagascar or Ice Age series for example and will help invest even adult audiences in the incident-packed adventure. Not only in their appearances are the creatures here quite far from being traditional cartoon critters; they talk (predominantly in distinguished British-tinged English) among themselves and with Mowgli who possesses a conspicuously American accent. The action pivots on Bagheeras decision that its finally time for Mowgli to leave his jungle home and join his own species. Protesting that he doesnt have a clue what humans are like Mowgli is finally convinced when the wise panther promises to see him to his destination resulting in a treacherous trek that leads them across increasingly inhospitable landscapes and into contact with all manner of animals. Its like a Heart of Darkness for kids. The tone significantly shifts with the arrival of Baloo (Bill Murray) a genial rascal of a bear whose addiction to honey instantly stamps him as a grown-up Winnie the Pooh. Strenuous effort has been expended to inject every line of Baloos ever-flowing commentary with snappy comedy a challenge met with success perhaps half the time. It also falls to Murray to resurrect Terry Gilkysons song ""The Bare Necessities"" from the 1967 film. But while the simple Baloo is content with the massive honeycombs Mowgli is able to procure for him a more formidable figure awaits in a spectacular abandoned ancient city. Kidnapped by no-nonsense monkeys Mowgli is put at the mercy of the Godfather of the jungle a grossly overgrown orangutan named King Louie (Christopher Walken) who talks with an old New Yawk accent and insists that Mowgli ""summon the red flower"" the animals term for the one thing humans seem to possess and control that animals cant fire. For his part sometime song-and-dance man Walken gets to reprise the Sherman Brothers tune Louis Prima handled 49 years ago ""I Wanna Be Like You."" The action finale while well staged is pretty predictable and includes a bad-guy death that repeats the same means of demise that greets the vast majority of Disney arch-villains going back decades (no hints but it would be great to have this remarkable consistency explained). But even as the drama and its treatment become increasingly conventional and familiar as the film moves toward its patly (and arguably overly) audience-pleasing wrap-up the exceptional visual quality and lifelike animal renditions remain stunning throughout. Favreau and cinematographer Bill Pope vigorously keep the camera moving at all but the quietest moments and the visual effects team led by Robert Legato and Adam Valdez has both created sumptuous settings that look as lifelike as any CGI ever presented in a studio feature and integrated both humans and animal characters into them in seamless ways. After having completely succeeded in transporting you to its primeval jungle setting the pic concludes at the very end of the lengthy final credits with the cheeky note ""Filmed in Downtown Los Angeles."" At least one sort of movie magic is still very much at work here.

Of all of the impressive details to appear on screen in Disneys live-action adaptation of ""The Jungle Book"" none is more startling than a title card at the close of the end credits reading ""Filmed in Downtown Los Angeles."" So immersively does the films visual-effects team craft every tree waterfall and flower of Rudyard Kiplings fantastical subcontinental setting and so carefully are the talking CGI animals rendered it almost beggars belief that the whole thing was shot in a 12-story building overlooking the 110 freeway. But aside from investing in top-drawer digital craftsmanship perhaps the canniest move Disney made on this film was hiring Jon Favreau to helm it. Maintaining the buoyant heartbeat beneath all the digital flash Favreau never loses sight of the fact that hes making an adventure story for children -- no small matter in a kid-pic landscape flooded with inappropriately gritty reboots and frenetic distraction devices -- and when positive word of mouth arrives to buttress Disneys all-out marketing efforts the studio should have a substantial hit on its hands. Favreau already has one four-star family pic to his credit with ""Elf"" but the most important touchstone from his filmography here is probably ""Iron Man"" in which the director hit all the marks of an effects-heavy tentpole while still allowing the film to breathe where it needed to. His lightness of touch proves an enormous asset as he builds this jungle into the type of dangerous sometimes pitiless setting that an average 10-year-old would nonetheless never want to leave. It cant rival the woolly looseness of Disneys 1967 animated classic of course but it succeeds on its own so well that such comparisons are barely necessary. Pulling freely from Kiplings stories Disneys own animated treatment and the inventions of screenwriter Justin Marks this ""Jungle Book"" certainly imposes a bit more of a strict heros-journey framework onto the source materials yet rarely does it lapse into the sort of po-faced seriousness that tends to sour so many aggressively modernized fairy stories. Kiplings story ""Mowglis Brothers"" serves as the films jumping-off point and we open on the 10-year-old man-cub (first-timer Neel Sethi) as hes deep into his wolf training. Discovered abandoned in the jungle by the sage black panther Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley all exasperated officiousness) Mowgli has been raised by wolf couple Raksha (Lupita Nyongo) and Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) but his development is lagging behind that of his lupine siblings and Bagheera admonishes him for using human ""tricks"" like tool building instead of learning the ways of the pack. When a dry season forces predators and prey into a brief ""water truce"" the rest of the jungle gets a look at the wolf packs unusual new charge. The despotic Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) takes exception having lost his left eye to an encounter with mankinds ""red flower"" fire and demands the boy be surrendered to him. Akela stares down the tiger but the conflict is enough to convince Mowgli to travel with Bagheera to rejoin human civilization; on their way Shere Khan springs a surprise attack and Mowgli flees off into the deep jungle alone. Its here that the familiar plot beats from Disneys first ""Jungle Book"" outing kick in and Mowgli joins forces with an ingratiatingly lazy bear Baloo (Bill Murray). As much as modern blockbuster style might demand some sort of theme-park-ready setpiece for every reel Favreau clearly understands that the Mowgli-Baloo relationship is the real key to the story and he slows the films pace long enough to build up an effective hangout vibe with Murray voicing the role as the worlds most charming ursine used-car salesman. Whether the sloped-shouldered heavy-lidded Baloo is designed to look a bit like Murray or Murray simply looks like a half-napping bear is open to debate but its only with him that the film ever risks setting foot into the uncanny valley Otherwise the animal effects are overwhelmingly successful taking the standard set by Rhythm and Hues CG tiger in ""Life of Pi"" and applying it throughout. It isnt just that the animal movements scan as real -- Shere Khan in particular is carefully rendered to be intimidatingly weighty when looming in the foreground while lighter than air when in flight -- but theyve figured out just how much to anthropomorphize the animal mouth movements to make their speaking seem natural without turning them into cartoons. Not all of it works. The all-but-contractually-obliged reprisals of Mouse House musical staples (""The Bare Necessities"" ""I Wanna Be Like You"") are inorganically threaded in and the decision to cast King Louie (Christopher Walken) as a a grotesque Col. Kurtz-esque gigantopithecus only makes the absence of Louis Prima sting even stronger. But when the film gets it right it sings. The appearance of Kaa the snake (voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the closest were likely to get to an ""Under the Skin"" sequel) is magnificently done exploiting the surround-sound capabilities of Dolby Atmos and a sense of slowly shifting scale for an unnervingly trippy sequence that stops just short of something that would trouble childrens sleep. Tackling his first feature-film role not only as the lead but also as the only flesh-and-blood character on screen young Sethi acquits himself well under what must have been challenging circumstances. His line readings dont always fully pop but he possesses a loose-limbed naturalness on camera and perhaps most importantly for a film like this he genuinely seems to be having fun. Voice work is excellent all around from Nyongos maternal warmth to Elbas arrogant malevolence and the late Garry Shandling has his moments as Ikki the skittish porcupine. Composer John Debney offers a lush symphonic score and the 3D work is impressive enough to justify the ticket price. Film Review The Jungle Book Reviewed at El Capitan Theater Hollywood April 1 2016.
