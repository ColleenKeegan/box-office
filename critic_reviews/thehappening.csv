By Anthony Lane Angelina Jolie as Fox a member of an ancient order of assassins.   Credit JOHN RITTER What is it like being Timur Bekmambetov? No artist should be confused too closely with his creations but anybody who sits through ""Wanted"" Bekmambetovs new movie will be tempted to wonder if the life style of the characters might not reflect or rub off on that of the director. How for example does he make a cup of coffee? My best guess based on the evidence of the film is that he tosses a handful of beans toward the ceiling shoots them individually into a fine powder leaves it hanging in the air runs downstairs breaks open a fire hydrant with his head carefully directs the jet of water through the window of his apartment sets fire to the building then stands patiently with his mug amid the blazing ruins to collect the precious percolated drops. Dont even think about a cappuccino. The great thing about Bekmambetov is that even the mildest of devices spur him into helpless exaggeration. ""Wanted"" begins with a flashback but not for him the gentle glance over the past month or the childhood cameo; instead up comes the dauntless title ""1000 years ago."" One day presumably a wet Thursday a secret society of medieval weavers suddenly decided to create an even more secret society of global assassins. This was done apparently to maintain ""the balance of the world"" a principle reiterated later in the film but the episode leaves you panting to know more. Why weavers? Why not potters or pastry cooks? Until now I never made the connection between haberdashery and homicide but ""Wanted"" is determined to prove the link and viewers will certainly think twice before joining their local knitting circle. Mind you we never discover who orders the kills it could be governments businessmen or bishops. Is the whole film no more than totalitarian housecleaning posing as democratic do-gooding and if so who will screen it for Vladimir Putin? We now leap a thousand years to Chicago or at any rate to an outsiders overheated fabrication of the city. Bekmambetov was born in the Soviet Union and this is his first film set in the United States but ""Wanted"" never feels solidly American and not just because James McAvoy keeps slipping into his native Scottish. He plays Wesley Gibson who loathes his existence. Given that it involves both accountancy and cuckoldry he may have a point and the twitchy Gibson is the heir of a hundred other movie mice headed by Jack Lemmon in ""The Apartment."" Bekmambetov however is simply unable or unwilling to let such quiet desperation sink in. Instead he pumps up the sound (the click of a stapler resounds like a rivet gun) and stuffs his camera into peoples faces for the sake of a bulging closeup. This is the filmmaking equivalent of prodding someone in the chest with a forefinger as youre telling a joke and it means that the tone remains the same at yelping level when Gibsons life is changed. A pity because its quite a shift; one moment hes waiting alone in a grocery store and the next Angelina Jolie is standing by his side. End of mousehood. Ms. Jolie is I am pleased to report in splendid form. Watch her as she runs along the top of a speeding train and approaching a tunnel lies back like a sunbather and lets the roof of it swoosh over her basking in the satisfaction of a near-miss and by extension in the worlds unflagging worship of her cool. ""Get away from me"" McAvoy shouts to her at one point and she gives an ineffable smile charmed by the absurdity of the request. You dont tell Angelina Jolie to go away; she tells you. In ""Wanted"" she plays Fox one of the fraternity of killers who informs Gibson that his father was the doyen of the group that he was wiped out only the day before by a rogue operator and that he weedy Wesley must learn the ropes and avenge this foul unnatural crime. Hamlet was under the same obligation but lacking access to high-powered rifles and exploding rats he took longer to finish the job. Gibson is introduced to the chief assassin Sloan (Morgan Freeman) who teaches him how to bend a bullet in mid-flight. ""Let your instincts guide you"" he advises having clearly enjoyed his time at the Obi-Wan Kenobi School of Karmic Weaponhood. To achieve a satisfactory bend you have to whip the pistol round like a discus thrower a skill soon perfected by our hero. As nonsense goes this has a certain gusto and glee and what dismayed me was that Bekmambetov felt the need to spice it with the addition of coarsely chopped violence. What looks set to be a boyish pop-eyed fantasy--if Angelina Jolie kicks out your windshield and asks you to take the wheel while she sprawls on your hood and shoots at the vehicle behind you can hardly refuse--warps into a welter of bloodletting. The knife work is especially cruel and it puts parents into a quandary their teen-age kids are the ideal (probably the sole) consumers of this loud silly dream about a furtive brotherhood but they are also precisely the wrong people to be told that stabbing is a talent to be envied and worse still that its effects wear off in a nice hot bath. As foreheads burst asunder and as Gibson caps the mayhem by firing repeatedly through the back of a dead mans head I wanted to ask Is this the true legacy of ""Pulp Fiction""--that the fiction would lose all credibility and make way for actual human pulp? Halfway through ""The Happening""as the movie began to splutter I realized what M. Night Shyamalan needs more than anything else. He needs Val Lewton. To anyone toiling in genre movies during the Second World War Lewton was a godsend a fixer a fabled storyteller and the kind of guy who gives producers a good name and stops directors from getting a bad one. Born in Yalta he wound up as the head of horror--now theres one for the resume--at R.K.O. in 1942 where he produced films such as ""The Ghost Ship"" ""The Body Snatcher"" ""Cat People"" and the unambiguously titled ""I Walked with a Zombie."" The last two were directed by the energetic Jacques Tourneur but even with lesser talents Lewton proved himself the nonpareil of atmosphere and zip. Too much of the first as he saw and the tale clogs up; too much of the second and you leave the horror behind. If Shyamalans need for such guidance seems more urgent than ever it may be because ""The Happening"" is an eco-drama and that I regret to say is a contradiction in terms. Environmental catastrophe is a clear and present danger but if youre a head-scratching screenwriter its not a patch on the Red Menace. To be fair for the first twenty minutes Shyamalan finds a regular rhythm of shock people in Central Park and then in the surrounding blocks start to halt in their tracks like robots on strike and take their own lives with whatever comes to hand--a firearm a high building a prong being used as a hair clip. As the story spreads and the action moves from New York to Philadelphia from town to countryside and from crowd to gaggle we slowly realize that greenery has gone toxic trees grass and plants are wafting death into our brains. The response to Shyamalans film has been almost shrublike in its venom and there is no denying that his ear for dialogue appears to be overgrown with moss. The performances too are weirdly stunted normally reliable actors like Mark Wahlberg John Leguizamo and Zooey Deschanel--playing respectively a science teacher a math teacher and a worried wife all fleeing the leafy threat--stalk through the action with a mixture of grimaces goofiness and what I charitably read as indigestion rather than catatonia. To be honest I would be perfectly happy to walk with a zombie after ninety minutes of this; it would feel like light relief. Nevertheless movies every bit as stumbling as ""The Happening"" and far more savage come out every month and few are greeted with such contempt. Why should this be? My suspicion is that Shyamalan despite everything still gets under peoples skin and that their mockery is a way of saying it aint so. He is plainly obsessive--that is not just the source of his appeal but the prelude to his follies--and we are made uneasy and embarrassed by obsession. (The same problem arises in Michael Powell films.) I have always taken Shyamalan to be a fearmonger but the new film suggests that he may be at heart a morbidologist he is trying to reinsert the fear of death into a moviegoing culture that would prefer to think of it as laughable dismissible or gross. People around me in the cinema were cackling at some of the suicides in ""The Happening"" but self-annihilation and the host of motives that can spur us toward it is no joke. Those who punish a filmmaker for the crime of humorlessness are the same audiences who go tense and quiet on the rare occasions when as Shyamalan did in ""The Sixth Sense"" he makes sombre and controlled use of the same anxieties. ""The Happening"" is an awful letdown yet it leaves you with something new as a gently waving tree--that classical image of pastoral tranquillity--mutates into a harbinger of doom. Its the first time Ive seen that and I guess it wont be the last.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Night Shyamalan Starring Mark Wahlberg Zooey Deschanel and John Leguizamo Theres a moment in the boring brain-dead new M. Night Shyamalan film The Happening when Mark Wahlberg turns to the camera trying to suppress a grin and asks ""Can this really be happening?"" I ask the same question every week but it just gets worse. Its not a good sign when a director casts Mr. Wahlberg a ruddy rapper-turned-actor who looks like a choirboy selling crack in the apse as a science teacher pondering the mystery of why honeybees are disappearing from coast to coast. To be a good scientist you must have a healthy respect for the laws of nature he tells his class. I am paraphrasing Professor Wahlberg of course. Nothing of real significance is worth quoting directly from any film written by M. Night Shyamalan. And you could stuff the entire plot of The Happening into a walnut shell. But thanks to the excellent cinematographer Tak Fujimoto there are layers of atmosphere worth noting. Two women are sitting on a bench in Central Park when a curious breeze rustles the leaves. One of them reaches for a darning needle and rams it through her jugular vein. Cut to a nearby construction site where the same breeze reaches the hard hats who leap from a tower scaffold above the city and crash to their deaths below. No its not fallout from the fleshpots of terrorism. According to CNN that breeze carries airborne brain-altering chemical toxins that are driving New Yorkers to mass suicide. The infected area is restricted to the Northeast but its spreading. (Nothing seems to be happening in Los Angeles but how would they know?) When New York is evacuated Professor Wahlberg and his wife (Zooey Deschanel) are invited to join fellow faculty member John Leguizamo to hide out at his mothers house in Philadelphia. On the way the train comes to a grinding halt and the passengers are discharged in the forests of Pennsylvania. From this point on a movie with so much potential for suspense just plods along cataloging a chain reaction of violent copycat suicides as people blow their brains out and throw themselves into the lions den at the zoo. Taking refuge in an abandoned farmhouse they run into a screechy hysterical old crone (Betty Buckley) who smashes her head through 29 glass windows but mercifully does not sing anything from Cats. In the end the plague seems to have reached the Champs Elysees in Paris threatening a sequel with subtitles. What is going on here? The explanation may make you reach for a gun yourself. According to Mr. Shyamalan its simple an extension of Al Gores environmental warning that if we dont stop destroying our planet then our planet will get even. For a movie with the potential for so much global-warming electricity its disappointingly low on voltage. How is it possible for one writer-producer-director hyphenate to raise financing for six films when each one is worse than the one before? His premises are equally predictable and always the same Unexplained psychic phenomena can happen to perfectly ordinary people. Trouble is in a Shyamalan flick an exasperating absence of requisite cinematic creepiness is always guaranteed. They dont make sense and they are as empty in the center as a chocolate-covered cherry in which the assembly line left out the maraschino. Theyre so kindergarten-level scary that I always figure everything out early. Even The Sixth Sense his only critical and box office success was too obvious to rate even one surprise. Minutes after it began when Bruce Willis entered the party and nobody spoke to or even looked at him I said ""Hes dead; they dont see him because hes a ghost.""

Night Shyamalan Distributor 20th Century Fox Release Date Jun 13 2008 Release Notes Nationwide Official Website www.thehappeningmovie.com Review It seems only yesterday that M. Night Shyamalan cast himself in Lady in the Water as an author who receives a message from a narf who tells him the story hes working on will inspire a child who will grow up and change the world. The theme of Shyamalans The Happening is just as grandiosethe end of human lifebut his confidence seems gone. A high-toned revenge-of-nature horror picture its a little depressed with only gross-out shocks (gushing jugulars bodies run over by lawnmowers) to relieve the torpor. Something is making people stop what theyre doing and kill themselves. Bad reviews cant be the culprit because its not just megalomaniacal filmmakers who are affected. Philadelphia science teacher Mark Wahlberg makes the vaguely creationist case that science is inadequate to explain the higher mysteries like why honeybees are disappearing and his wife (Zooey Deschanel) has gone frigid. Wahlberg figures it out the way Paul Giamatti in Lady in the Water figured out the narf was endangered by a rogue scruntin big furrowed-brow close-ups that would kill the career of a lesser actor.

Night Shyamalans talent anymore Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME On a lovely morning in Central Park two young women sit on a bench. One thinks she hears a scream and notices that the strollers on the promenade have frozen in their tracks. The other woman seemingly distracted removes a large hairpin and stabs it through her cheek. At a nearby high-rise some construction workers on the ground floor turn to see that one of their co-workers has fallen to his death from the roof. Two others drop from on high then half a dozen more. Its raining suicidal men What -- is -- happening? These two vignettes could be the start of such a good movie. Instead and alas The Happening is the latest most dispiriting indication that writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has lost the touch that made The Sixth Sense a suspense classic and his standing as a young master of creepiness in the grand Hitchcock tradition. Hes just 37 but his best films are so far behind him its as if hes forgotten how he made them work. In a Philadelphia high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is yanked out of class to be told along with the other teachers about the events in New York City. No ones certain if its a terrorist attack or a random quirk of nature but ""some kind of airborne chemical toxin"" is spreading across the Northeast thats making people kill themselves. The pupils are sent home and Elliot decides that he his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and his math-teacher buddy (John Leguizamo) will get out of town. The movie is the story of their flight. Shyamalan has some fine scenes of self-inflicted death a YouTube video of a man walking amid the lions at a zoo offering his arms for their next meal; the bucolic vista of a Princeton street where people have hanged themselves from trees; the sight of a family man revving up his Jeep and driving into a tree; the report of a bus in a lake. But he didnt attach these potent vignettes to a story with any narrative or emotional plausibility. The movie keeps ignoring its internal logic. If the killer is borne by the wind why dont people in the affected area just stay inside with the windows shut and wait it out instead of traipsing across eastern Pennsylvania farmland? For those who care less about science-fiction doomsday scenarios than the gnawing sense of dissatisfaction Shyamalan often wrings from his characters the problems of the central couple are not exactly earth-shaking. Theyre childless hes a little exasperated that shes so withdrawn and she shared an apparently innocent dessert with a colleague who keeps pestering her with cell-phone messages. Wahlberg does all his fretting with a furrowed brow (which has not two but three vertical lines possibly a new fashion statement for anxiety) while Deschanel bites her lip and rolls her gigantic blue eyes. Neither actor can come close to the hollow-eyed anxiety that Bruce Willis displayed in The Sixth Sense and which anchored that movies near superhuman grief. Eventually Elliot and Alma form a kind of family with the math teachers daughter but that hasnt nearly the dramatic heft needed to fill in the cracks around the disintegrating main story. What you get is a lot of impotent anger people walking into harms way and the sniper-like picking off of supporting players -- all the dumbest tropes of horror movies without the robust scares a good thrill-fest delivers. Its a sorry enough spectacle to make admirers of The Sixth Sense wonder if they didnt overrate that movie and the directors whole oeuvre? Is Shyamalan a sham? NIGHT MOVES ... DOWN Heres a movie trivia game I wish I didnt have to play. Is there any major director who has made six consecutive films each one markedly inferior to the one before? A case can be made that the answer is M. Night Shyamalan. (Im ignoring Shyamalans first two features the cross-cultural Praying With Anger and the juvenile drama Wide Awake because they were clearly apprentice work and frankly they dont fit into my argument.) The Sixth Sense (1999) was a triumph of O. Henry-suspense and also an essay on the solitude of grief. Unbreakable (2000) a comic-book superhero battle told at an art-film tempo was nearly as good and had another terrific weighed-down performance by Willis. Signs (2002) was a letdown on the alien-invasion front but it had Mel Gibson playing his own form of domestic desolation. The Village (2004) a sort of Amish retelling of Shirley Jacksons The Lottery was the first of his films to test -- and break -- the viewers patience. And The Lady in the Water (2006) in which another alien creature emerges -- this one a water sprite in the swimming pool of an apartment building -- fell into the preposterous mess category. Some critics like me gave Shyamalan a lot of rope because of the skill he showed in his first big films a masterly camera style in which he was utterly in control of exactly how much visual information should be revealed -- or concealed. He was just a natural-born suspense filmmaker of the old school. And in the age of movie facetiousness his dead-serious take on middle-age morosity was a striking theme for a kid still in his 20s (when he made The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable). The box office told the tale of Shyamalans success The Sixth Sense grossed 294 million in North America; then after a decent but detumescent 95 million for Unbreakable he rebounded with 228 million for Signs (Gibsons star power helped) and 114 million for The Village -- figures ranging from honorable to sensational considering that he put his handsome movies together for about half what theyd have cost anyone else anywhere else. Shyamalan makes all his films where he grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia. (Hes the most prominent member of the Philadelphia school of filmmaking. In fact so far as I know hes the principal and the only student. Theres no notable indie film scene in Philly though movies from Rocky to National Treasure Shooter and Baby Mama have used it as a location.) A monumentally self-assured filmmaker and a superb pitchman for his own projects Shyamalan used his Sixth Sense clout to maintain his independence. Aside from making his elaborate movies at home hed play power games with the movie brass allowing an executive just one afternoon to read his new script before returning it to him. That sort of bravado works only as long as the product sells. But when The Lady in the Water belly-flopped with 42 million domestic Hollywood could finally say no to the wunderkind. The Happening is distributed by 20th Century Fox but the list of seven or eight producers and executive producers in the credits suggests that Shyamalan raised the money for this one himself and that hes no longer the independent golden boy -- just another indie-film director scrambling for backers. And now we have this ill wind this feeble gust of an environmental horror story. The writer-directors disintegration from robust artistic health to narrative incoherence from hitmaker to box-office loser has an almost tragic trajectory. Its a saga worthy of being told by the young M. Night Shyamalan. Perhaps with his next film hell have a surprise twist of cinematic brilliance that will explain and atone for the creepy stuff thats been happening to him.

Also by retitling it as ""The Incredible Hulk."" The previous try released only five years ago was directed by Ang Lee and ran afoul of lumpish special effects. This new production starring Edward Norton as Bruce Banner looks a lot better -- sometimes it looks great -- and its a thunderously efficient enterprise with a nice surprise at the very end. (Louis Leterrier directed from a script by Zak Penn.) Once again though the film is defined by the strengths and weaknesses of the source material. While Bruce is working on anger management you may find yourself working on boredom management and matching his rate of success. As the story begins the hero is hiding out in a Brazilian slum. He has a day job in a bottling plant and a local guru whos teaching him how to keep his anger genie bottled up. The cinematographer Peter Menzies Jr. and the production designer Kirk M. Petruccelli find sumptuous images in the plants machinery and the squalid sprawl of Bruces hilltop favela. When the bad guys -- i.e. a special forces team headed by William Hurts General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross -- track Bruce down and try to capture him the ensuing chase has an other-worldly quality; never has poverty been more photogenic. (In case youve forgotten the military wants to kill Bruce in order to understand and exploit his power which resulted from a biomedical experiment gone wrong. Never has a back story been laid out more exhaustively -- in comic books on TV and the big screen.) Edward Norton is always an interesting actor and he brings a distinctive presence to the proceedings. Liv Tylers Betty the generals daughter and the love of Bruces life brings older-fashioned movies to mind -- one sodden love scene looks like a hapless theft from ""Waterloo Bridge."" Tim Roth can be a brilliant actor when the occasion allows but on this occasion he does nothing but fevered shtick as Emil Blonsky a ferocious soldier whose own lust for power turns him into a monster called The Abomination. With the exception of Tim Blake Nelson who has a small but enjoyable role as a nutty professor the live actors skills are underused. The films heart such as it is lies in its Green Guy eruptions which are animated and genuinely impressive but more grandiose than grand. The problem is the nature of the beast. The Hulk stomps around punching out adversaries and breaking very big things like Humvees and helicopters with gratifying verve. Thats pretty much all he does though even when he takes on The Abomination in a knock-down dragged-out climax. Hes a one-trick pony of epic proportions. The Happening There appears to be an event happening"" someone says early in ""The Happening."" Its only the first of countless clanking off-kilter lines in M. Night Shyamalans woeful clunker of a paranoid thriller. The event involves ordinary people -- more and more of them as the story grinds on -- doing terrible things to themselves because of some unspecified aberration of nature. According to one theory plants are releasing a neurotoxin that is ""basically flipping the self-preservation switch."" Could be. ""The Happening"" makes you wonder whether Mr. Shyamalans own switch may have been flipped. How else to explain his films befuddling infelicities insistent banalities shambling pace and pervasive ineptitude? This isnt a case of picking on a guy whos already had a big flop the infamous ""Lady in the Water."" I try to see whats on the screen not whats gone before and the movie I saw was truly mysteriously awful. Unless of course it was meant to be a parody of such nature-lashing-out thrillers as ""The Birds."" But parodies are supposed to be funny and the only laughs I heard were bad ones. For the record the cast includes Mark Wahlberg as a high-school science teacher and Zooey Deschanel as his almost-estranged wife. They try as good actors do to find truth in their roles. None is there to be found. Quid Pro Quo Quid Pro Quo"" a bizarre but audacious debut feature by Carlos Brooks explores the fetishist subculture of disability wannabes -- able-bodied men and women who want to be disabled. Nick Stahl plays a public radio reporter Isaac who has used a wheelchair since a childhood automobile accident that killed his parents. Vera Farmiga is Fiona a woman who not only yearns to be in a wheelchair but considers herself a paraplegic ""trapped in a walking body."" Mr. Brookss film which was handsomely photographed by Michael McDonough is nothing if not memorable and that isnt meant as a back-handed compliment. Unlike so many first films that play it charming and safe this one plays with darkly erotic notions that can border on the absurd. At one point when Isaac offers a strange revelation of his own Fiona says ""Youre weirding me out"" which is a set-up for a snicker until she adds ""and that isnt easy."" At other moments when silliness shatters the somber mood you may suddenly remember that youre watching an actor pretending to be paralyzed and an actress pretending to pretend she is too. A particularly gifted actress it should be said Id be happy to watch Ms. Farmiga as Ozzies Harriet let alone a woman as far removed from the emotional mainstream as this one. And she does make her character alluring in Fionas tortured way. But some scenes dont work at all -- among them one in which Fionas nervous play-acting is impossibly busy -- and Mr. Brooks fails to resolve some of the themes he has put in play even if his films title is eventually explained or over-explained. I look forward to his next one though. He certainly steers clear of the pedestrian. DVD Tip ENLARGE If you want to be deeply weirded out by a film about a fetishist subculture look into ""Crash"" -- not Paul Haggiss Oscar winner from 2004 but David Cronenbergs controversial (some would say outrageous) cult favorite of the same name made in 1996 about people who get an erotic charge from car crashes. The cast includes Holly Hunter James Spader and Elias Koteas. Find television listings for the original The Incredible Hulk series at LocateTV.

Night Shyamalan. In an attempted rebound from the critical and commercial calamity of ""Lady in the Water"" the writer-director has scaled back most of his characteristic touches -- the contorted horror/fantasy mythology the ""gotcha"" twist ending even his trademark cameo -- instead serving up a patchy uninspired eco-thriller whose R rating (a first for Shyamalan) looks more like a B.O. hindrance than an artistic boon. After an initial bloom of interest the Fox release will likely wilt quickly in the summer heat. One might charitably describe ""The Happening"" as a transitional work for M. Night Shyamalan. In an attempted rebound from the critical and commercial calamity of ""Lady in the Water"" the writer-director has scaled back most of his characteristic touches -- the contorted horror/fantasy mythology the ""gotcha"" twist ending even his trademark cameo -- instead serving up a patchy uninspired eco-thriller whose R rating (a first for Shyamalan) looks more like a B.O. hindrance than an artistic boon. After an initial bloom of interest the Fox release will likely wilt quickly in the summer heat. At the very least Shyamalans latest will almost certainly be greeted with less impassioned scorn than its predecessor; unlike 2006s ""Lady in the Water"" it arrives in theaters unencumbered by embarrassing tie-in tell-alls or reports of overweening directorial ego. (And if there are any movie critics among ""The Happenings"" many victims the pic doesnt call attention to it.) Trouble is its hard to imagine ""The Happening"" being greeted with much impassioned anything. Shyamalans story -- about a married couple and a small child being driven farther and farther from civilization by a fatal airborne threat -- covers territory already over-tilled by countless disaster epics and zombie movies offering little in the way of suspense visceral kicks or narrative vitality to warrant the retread. A mildly creepy prologue unfolds one morning in Central Park where several pedestrians suddenly freeze in place and others start committing bizarre acts of self-mutilation and suicide. (""Those people look like theyre clawing at themselves"" marvels one onlooker in one of the scripts less felicitous examples of telling and not showing.) Meanwhile the leaves rustle ominously in the wind providing an early clue to the source of this strange and deadly epidemic. Cut to Philadelphia where high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) hears of what is initially characterized as a bioterrorist attack. He and his lovely slightly kooky wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) traveling with math teacher Julian (an over-talkative John Leguizamo) and his 8-year-old daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) flee the city only to have their train break down in the middle of nowhere. Julian abruptly leaves Jess in the care of Elliot and Alma so he can catch a ride back to the city to search for his wife. Hiking across broad rather beautiful stretches of Pennsylvania farmland (mostly shot on location) the three soon hook up with other refugees only to find their way blocked by fresh corpses at every turn -- they see dead people -- suggesting the danger is closing in on all sides. Yet the fact that the infected kill only themselves immediately dilutes any sense of real peril. Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock have been Shyamalans two most oft-cited filmmaking forebears and the scenario here carries faint echoes of Spielbergs ""War of the Worlds"" and particularly Hitchcocks ""The Birds"" in that the nature of the threat here (cue more wind effects and trembling branches) seems organic rather than man-made. Elliot being a science teacher deduces whats going on fairly quickly spouting the occasional mouthful of botanical mumbo-jumbo when hes not arguing with Alma. As he did in ""Signs"" (which ""The Happening"" comes to resemble as its characters seek refuge in a little house on the Pennsylvania prairie) Shyamalan tries to show a family breaking down then piecing itself back together while an apocalypse rages outside its windows. Yet he never taps into what makes Wahlberg and especially Deschanel so uniquely edgy and compelling to watch and although both actors emote bravely neither feels like an intuitive match for their underwritten roles. While the R rating allows for more explicit gore effects than Shyamalan has resorted to in the past the violent incidents are relatively few and typically viewed from a distance. The helmers gift has always been for conjuring suspense from silences shadows and enclosed spaces a talent that gets little workout here. In short this is a Shyamalan movie minus the bravado the swagger; there are no audacious attempts to pull out the rug from under the audience no ham-fisted lessons about the importance of religious belief or the power of storytelling. The director even limits his customary appearance to an offscreen role a choice that seems sadly in keeping with the rest of this oddly hesitant insubstantial film. The big surprise at the end of ""The Happening"" is that even viewers whove been annoyed by his tricks and traps in the past may find themselves hoping he uses them -- or something better -- the next time around.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Happening 1/2 (out of four)Stars Mark Wahlberg Zooey Deschanel John Leguizamo Betty BuckleyDirector M. Night ShyamalanDistributor 20th Century FoxRating R for violent and disturbing imagesRunning time 1 hour 31 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  HEADLINES FROM PEOPLE.COM SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Forty years ago there was a movie with Faye Dunaway and George Maharis called The Happening. It was about hippies ""going with the flow."" This summer we have a new Happening thats pretty much its opposite but no less ridiculous. Its about a quasi-apocalyptic event that causes people to resist ""going with the flow"" and kill themselves in a variety of gruesome ways. But they do it unconsciously. Sort of. CLIP Preview of The Happening CALENDAR Plan your summer movie schedule Speculation surrounding these mysterious suicides initially focuses on terrorist attacks a toxic substance released by a nuclear power plant or a government experiment gone awry. Or could it be that nature finally has had it with the callousness of humanity and is emitting poisons? Fashioning his film around a high school biology teacher (an uncharacteristically dull Mark Wahlberg) writer/director M. Night Shyamalan tries to give the events a scientific underpinning. But his logic is spotty so what are meant to be eerie moments are not convincing. For example a train comes to a screeching halt because conductors inexplicably lost contact with ""everybody."" But weve been told that the event is limited to the Northeast USA so how does a national train line lose all contact especially when cellphones are still working and TV and radio news broadcasts keep pumping out reports? The idea of a mysterious toxin that can annihilate people by destroying their self-preservation instinct is intriguing. But as set forth in this film which opens in an effectively creepy fashion but loses steam quickly the premise grows far-fetched. There are a few bona-fide scares and unsettling images. But for a doomsday thriller the terror is diluted. The dialogue is wooden the suspense never really mounts and the story feels inert. Shyamalan isnt drawing the caliber of performances from his actors as he used to. Who can forget Haley Joel Osments haunting portrayal in The Sixth Sense or that of Toni Collette who played his mother or Bruce Willis in arguably his best role? This time talented actors such as Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel who plays his wife seem unusually one-note. Wahlberg wears the same expression in nearly every scene his emotional level staying at the same bland pitch. Deschanel seems to be going through the motions reciting her lines almost robotically. We are supposed to believe their marriage is at a crossroads but nothing about their interactions seems believable. Near the end after Wahlberg and Deschanel have been on the run from the mysterious force its as if Deschanels character suddenly forgot what movie she was in. Shyamalans work has been deteriorating since the stir he caused in 1999 with The Sixth Sense. The only worthy successor has been 2002s Signs. His last couple of movies --The Village and Lady in the Water -- have been particular disappointments and The Happening continues the trend.

"The Happening Unintentionally funny | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsThe Happening Unintentionally funny It is a well-established fact that the human race has been a very naughty species of late and deserves a good hot cosmic spanking which is why apocalyptic movies such as The Happening are now quite popular.Ashlyn Sanchez John Leguizamo and Mark Wahlberg in The Happening.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. June 13 2008 The Happening (out of 4)Starring Mark Wahlberg Zooey Deschanel and John Leguizamo. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. 91 minutes. At major theatres. 14A It is a well-established fact that the human race has been a very naughty species of late and deserves a good hot cosmic spanking which is why apocalyptic movies such as The Happening are now quite popular.Its a good opportunity for M. Night Shyamalan who scored a major breakthrough with his 1999 paranormal thriller The Sixth Sense but whose subsequent films such as the 2002 Mel Gibson vehicle Signs have been disappointing. Will The Happening halt and reverse his artistic slide?The movie begins with ominous background music as New Yorkers stroll past Central Park. Suddenly everybody freezes. Some start walking backwards. A young woman on a park bench removes a hatpin from her do and casually skewers her own jugular vein. Construction workers leap off tall buildings. Cut to a classroom in a Philadelphia high school where science teacher Elliott Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is urging his students to consider the disappearing bee epidemic. Where have the industrious insects gone? Is it just part of natures mystery?""Science will come up with some reason"" Elliott says. ""But in the end it will just be a theory. To be a good scientist you must have respectful awe for the laws of nature."" Well soon see what nasty little tricks those laws of nature have in store for us. Meanwhile ushering his students out of the class Elliott repeats the rules and procedures of the scientific method ""Identify variables. Design the experiment.""At home his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) watches the bad news on television. In New York and all across the northeastern United States she hears toxins are spreading that make people want to do themselves in. She and Elliott join other panicky Philadelphians fleeing to the countryside but the breakdown of transportation leaves them stranded.At this point Shyamalan who has great affinity with Alfred Hitchcock constructs a scene modelled on the one in The Birds where fearful townspeople gather in a restaurant to talk about our feathered friends as agents of natures vengeance.In Shyamalans scene frightened refugees gather in a roadside diner to talk about their own doomsday experience. Its not birds this time its - what?Meanwhile the suicides get more gruesome to the point where they become unintentionally funny. I never thought Id laugh at a scene of a man feeding parts of his body to lions in a zoo or guffaw over the sight of a man lying down in the path of a gigantic lawn-mowing machine.Shyamalan seems to have lost his sense of the fine line between the disturbingly grotesque and the outright ridiculous. The film even seems to be a parody of the scientific method. Elliott himself tells a young girl ""You know everyone gives off energy dont you?"" Tests have proven it he says. And then he produces a mood ring - one of those classic emblems of pseudo-science.Pressed to make urgent decisions he falls back on Mr. Science Teacher. ""Identify variables"" he whispers to himself at a moment of crisis as if in prayer. ""Design your experiment.""Shyamalans films have always had a religious and/or paranormal theme. Here he seems to be emphasizing science - theres only one character in this movie a demented old woman who displays religious symbols and they dont do her a lick of good.I suppose you can call this emphasizing science but the scientific rationale for the movies plot is goofy. Thats nothing new for future fiction. Whats new is that the movie seems to point to the underlying uselessness of science period.One scientist calls the doomsday event an ""act of nature"" and says ""Well never fully understand it"" echoing Elliott in his high-school classroom.That admission constitutes a gap through which an 18-wheel paranormal truck can drive. I seem to hear Shyamalan already revving up the engines in anticipation of his next movie - but will audiences still have patience to take another chance on him?

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson (UNITED STATES) Photo LUCAS JACKSON REUTERS Movie review Urban flight in The Happening 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Happening Suspense drama. Starring Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. (R. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at SFGate.com/movies.) M. Night Shyamalan made ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999 and things havent been going right for him ever since. His new film ""The Happening"" is his best so far this decade and even then it falls short of its filmmakers aspirations. Its an entertaining movie which is half the game but its not scary which it should be. Neither is it something to be taken seriously though its intended to be. Without looking over Shyamalans shoulder it would be impossible to diagnose the problem precisely but by watching his movies its easy to make a guess. Hes being anxious with his talent. Hes not being free and letting it expand but forcing it to compress. All art is a dance between inspiration and control and ever since ""The Sixth Sense"" Shyamalan has been writing tight instead of loose. Shyamalan will get a great idea - for example ""The Happening"" which has a fine premise - but instead of letting his idea breathe and develop and see where it might go he jumps all over it and prematurely shapes it into a story. He lets his intellect kick in far too early into the process muscling his imagination into arbitrary structures. Instead of confidently allowing his ideas to reveal the form they want to take he crams them into some preconceived notion of what an M. Night Shyamalan movie should be. At least thats how ""Signs"" ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"" looked from here. And it further explains why its so easy to identify the moment in Shyamalans films when inspiration runs dry. Its usually the point at which we begin to get the Big Message whatever it might be. Its also the point at which he starts to get obvious making every stranger for instance into a certifiable weirdo. (Why is Bruce Dern yet to appear in a Shyamalan film?) But unlike the Hitchcock weirdos who are genuinely unsettling Shyamalans weirdos enter to the sound of a typewriter. We see them coming and know where theyre going. We know where M. Night is going. None of this would matter - who cares if Shyamalan fulfills his promise? - except that this filmmaker is trying to do something worth doing which is revive the classic suspense drama or perhaps update it for the new century. In ""The Happening"" he begins in New Yorks Central Park on a summer morning in which people suddenly stand stock-still and then proceed to kill themselves. They use whatevers handy. A gun a knitting needle. Construction workers start throwing themselves off buildings. What gives? Something is in the air. Maybe its a terrorist attack in the form of a toxin. Maybe some chemical out of a CIA lab has accidentally gone airborne. Or maybe its ... something else. Whatever it is everyone starts evacuating major Northeastern cities just to be safe. That includes Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) a Philadelphia high school science teacher his sensitive wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and his best friend (John Leguizamo). They get on a train headed for the countryside. The stars are engaging and the premise is irresistible. That gets Shyamalan almost there - and thats where he stays almost there. (This is off topic but has anybody else noticed that Deschanel is one of the most beautiful women in American movies? Seriously.) Trapped - again Like most Shyamalan films ""The Happening"" takes the form of a national catastrophe but the action gradually contracts around a handful of characters and ends up where most Shyamalan films end up with people in a small enclosed space trying to keep some mysterious malevolent force from getting inside. Once again this is Shyamalans fate to start out huge and end up small cramped and enclosed. Is this plot motif a personal obsession of his? I doubt it. My guess is that its simply a consequence of his process. Shyamalan takes enormous ideas and presses down on them. He smothers and confines them to the point that theyre stuck in a tiny room and cant breathe. Finally when he gets his ideas so small that they cant get any smaller he ends his movies. Thus he reveals himself Plot motif as unconscious metaphor. Neil LaBute is another talented writer-director who got lucky young and who has an identifiable style that could easily have boxed him in. But he has been wise enough to do other peoples screenplays occasionally. Shyamalan needs that variety. He needs a chance to loosen up and pull from another side of his brain. And from now on whenever he has the impulse to write another scene with people stuck in a room with bad things going on outside he needs to let that be the alarm bell - and turn off the computer and go for a long walk. -- AdvisoryThis movie contains violence and disturbing images.

"Happening The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; happening-the ) Happening The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli M. Night Shyamalan has always been something of an illusionist. Even at his best he succeeds not because hes a masterful storyteller but because hes an expert at sleight-of-hand and pulling rabbits out of his hat. With The Lady in the Water Shyamalans smoke dissipated and his mirrors broke and he hasnt repaired them in time for The Happening. In fact this 2008 thriller eclipses The Lady in the Water in terms of ineptitude. Its borderline unwatchable and raises the question of whether anyone will be satisfied with what the director has translated from script to screen. This isnt a long movie - unlike many summertime would-be ""big events"" it clocks in well under two hours - but it serves as an endurance test. The Happening has an apocalyptic premise. Some kind of mysterious neurotoxin has been released in New Yorks Central Park causing people to become disoriented and suicidal. They eliminate themselves in interesting ways involving implements as diverse as knitting needles and lawnmowers. The airborne killer soon spreads throughout Manhattan then expands to Philadelphia and Boston and all around the northeast. What is initially posited as a terrorist attack may in fact be something else. The story centers on four individuals - high school teacher Elliot (Mark Wahlberg); his emotionally distant wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel); his best friend Julian (John Leguizamo); and Julians young daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). They escape by train from Philadelphia just before the epidemic hits but find themselves stranded in rural Eastern Pennsylvania  fleeing from the wind and hoping to find a place of shelter in which to weather the storm. There are two elements a film like The Happening needs to succeed a powerful sense of atmosphere and strong character development. When a film possesses a minimal plot it needs something - anything - to capture the viewers interest. It needs people with whom audience members can identify and about whom they can care and it needs a sense of menace a feeling that the threat is real and immediate. The Happening possesses neither. Faced with stilted dialogue thats a patchwork of howlingly bad lines and clichA(c)s theres little that leads Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel can do other than grit their teeth and soldier on. Neither gives a memorable performance but the movie loses us long before their acting can be called into question. Shyamalan likes to compare himself to Alfred Hitchcock (and The Happening includes nods to The Birds) but even at his worst the Master of Suspense understood the importance of atmosphere. Shyamalan on the other hand fails to grasp that his constant shots of trees and bushes swaying to the promptings of the wind do not invoke the sense of dread hes hoping for. In actuality there are times when these repeated images verge on self-parody and it doesnt help that characters start talking to the vegetation. Significant chunks of The Happening might have been unintentionally amusing if the end result wasnt so sad and dispiriting. It takes great skill as a director to make viewers believe the wind and plants are to be feared and its evident that Shyamalan has overreached himself by a stretch. Even the singing Audrey II in Little Shop of Horrors was more ominous. Its easy enough to see what Shyamalan is trying to do but ""trying"" can be distanced by a chasm from ""succeeding"" as is the case here. Had The Happening worked it might have been the kind of creepy story that gets under your skin but the actual movie looks and feels like something made for almost no budget by a filmmaker with mediocre talent. Theres no point to it unless its to trumpet a way-too-obvious and strident pro-environmentalist message. (One that makes The Day After Tomorrow seem subtle by comparison.) The Happening is a bore with none of the tension and suspense needed to keep us interested. Even simple scenes reek of contrivance. Everything in this movie is artificial - fake to a level beyond what even those with blockbuster-benumbed senses will endure. We dont believe in these people their relationships their circumstances or even the things they say. Worse still we dont care. It doesnt matter if they live or die if theres a happy ending or some kind of twist. The Happening is a movie to walk out of sleep through or - best of all - not to bother with.

Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. With Mark Wahlberg Zooey Deschanel. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. ONE AND A HALF STARS In ""The Happening"" Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel flee a tie-dyed gang of rabid hippies turned by a toxic batch of patchouli oil into flesh-eating zombies who ravage the populace while the titular hit by the Supremes plays over and over. No? Well I couldnt quite get that gruesome/groovy idea -- or the old Diana Ross song -- out of my head once I heard the title to M. Night Shyamalans new shocker. And as silly as that was it was still a lot more terrifying than anything in his latest horror. Nearly 10 years ago Shyamalan had a break-out blockbuster with ""The Sixth Sense"" the I-see-dead-people story with a twist guaranteed to shock anyone whod never seen ""Carnival of Souls."" But since then -- ""Unbreakable"" ""Signs"" ""The Village"" and the nearly unwatchable ""Lady in the Water"" -- its been a slow slide. ""The Happening"" was supposed to mark a fresh start. For one thing the film is -- almost defiantly -- rated R as if to signal Shyamalans decision to move away from subtler PG-13 thrills. For another Shyamalan had been complaining he was tired of being known as the writer with ""the twist"" -- indicating that this story would try for something riskier. But looking around me at a screening? I saw bored people. Wahlberg -- struggling unsuccessfully with some tin-eared dialogue -- is Elliot a high-school science teacher; Zooey Deschanel a look of perpetual surprise in her Levis-blue eyes is his wife Alma. They have some troubles in their marriage too (as oddly indicated by Shyamalan by the fact they dont have kids). But thats not the only trouble they have -- once some strange toxin starts filling the air and short-circuiting people into abruptly killing themselves one by one. There are a number of problems with this scenario all of which Shyamalan -- who produces directs writes and cameos in his own movies -- was too close to see. Such as for example that if you make your monster an invisible toxin youre robbing your movie of visuals. Or that as plagues go contagious self-destruction isnt particularly scary; Deschanel and Wahlberg are running all right but nothings chasing them. Shyamalan has always been a careful filmmaker and ""The Happening"" hasnt just been tossed off despite the directors lower-the-expectations talk on the web of it being a B-movie. Longtime collaborator Tak Fujimoto (who before he started shooting Shyamalans movies photographed films as diverse as ""Badlands"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"") finds menace in clouds and trees; James Newton Howards score is rich and resonant. And yet theres still not much for Wahlberg and Deschanel to do the movies final eco-horror ""message"" wouldnt have been out of place in a genuine B-movie horror like ""Frogs"" -- and for all the suggestions of a different path Shyamalan never takes anything beyond than the well-paved slightly preachy road of his previous films. If he was serious about getting an R rating then he should have pushed the material in truly disturbing ways; if he wanted to eschew easy ""twists"" then he should have embraced chaotic even existential turns of the plot. If Shyamalans ever going to do something different then he should have made something manic dark and twisted. But thats not ""Happening."" Rating note The film contains gory violence and strong language. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

NIGHT-MARE By Kyle Smith View author archive email the author follow on twitter Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) June 13 2008 | 522am WHEN a malicious breeze begins to blow in ""The Happening"" fear sets in - the fear that the only thing that will occur is the Shyamalan hitting the fan. Someday this movies principal claim to fame will be that it inspired an episode of The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror (""The Crappening""?). Lets review the oeuvre of M. Night Shyamalan since ""The Sixth Sense"" stupid ending stupid ending stupid ending and in a change of pace with his last film ""Lady in the Water"" stupid all the way through. For his latest trick this back-room-of-the-Ramada magician has given us no trick at all. ""The Happening"" has no ending. I count that as an improvement over ""The Village"" and ""Unbreakable"" each of which concluded with one of the fastest audience stampedes out of a theater Ive ever seen. ""The Happening"" is about unexplained outbreaks of mass suicide in several Northeastern cities. Shyamalan has a lot of fun imagining cool ways you could kill yourself if you werent afraid of pain. Drive your jeep into a tree? Too obvious. How about lying down in front of an industrial-size lawnmower or punching out a window with your skull? A pair of schoolteachers (Mark Wahlberg John Leguizamo) and the wife (Zooey Deschanel) of the Wahlberg character try to guess whats happening as the background boils with speculation. Could it be terrorism? Does it have to do with bees? How about chemical weapons seeping out of the CIA? Since were (as always with M. Night) in Pennsylvania there are unique potential sources of toxins to worry about such as Three Mile Island and Philadelphia Eagles fans. There is a lot of chatter about global warming about science about geometric progression about ecological disaster. ""Calculus calculus calculus"" someone mutters but if those are the only remaining options Id just as soon saw my neck open on the nearest broken window too. As in ""The War of the Worlds"" rumor takes over and peoples immediate reaction is to flee somewhere anywhere shooting whoever gets in their way. But the story isnt a puzzle in which scenes yield more pieces that the audience tries to learn how to put together. Its just setup setup setup the end. When Betty Buckley turns up as a bitter off-the-grid loner such is Shyamalans dismal track record that you suspect right away that she serves no purpose except to pad the running time. Shyamalan has hit on something though and he does set up an IV drip of tension. The moment is right for a movie like this. Eco-unease and terrorism are in the air both of them (for many) carrying the stink of our own sins as a plausible root cause. It wouldnt take much to persuade todays audience that the answer blowin in the wind is that a hard rains a-gonna fall. With a slightly brainier imagination at work ""The Happening"" could have been a spooky little art film whose purpose wasnt so much to tell a linear story as to strum on our inner sense of looming catastrophe the unanswered questions adding to the dread. That would call on skills Shyamalan has not shown since his only good movie making characters interesting and dressing up dialogue with something other than plodding functionality (""Whatever is happening is happening to smaller and smaller populations"") red herrings (""We had tiramisu together. That is it"") or dull jokes (""Im talking to a plastic plant.""). Laying down a witty or ironic subtext as Stanley Kubrick would have is not within Shyamalans powers. Kubricks films are made to be pondered over repeated viewings. No one will watch any of Shyamalans recent films twice. A movie that features Wahlberg suggesting everyone try to outrun the wind can barely be watched once. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next PBS SHOW LOOKING FOR NYC HOME TO REDO Read Next PBS SHOW LOOKING FOR NYC HOME TO REDO Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 40527 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20897 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 13811 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 12 2008 316 PM Listen up Im about to reveal the big twist at the end of ""The Happening"" the new sci-fi mystery from M. Night Shyamalan. So if you dont want to know what it is consider this fair warning and move along to the next review. Seriously. Its coming up now. Ready? The big twist is that ... theres no twist at all. None. Zip. Nada. Now Shyamalan - who made his name with ""The Sixth Sense"" - is hardly required to provide us with a double-take moment in every movie. But if hes not going to offer much in the first 88 minutes hed better deliver big-time before wrapping things up. Since he doesnt you deserve to know now - not after youve waited an hour and a half for a payoff that never arrives. Things kick off on a sunny morning in Central Park when crowds of people suddenly start killing themselves. This scene soon repeats itself along the East Coast apparently as the result of some mysterious mind-altering toxin. Terrorists are blamed but Philadelphia science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) suspects theres an ecological explanation that implicates us all. Unfortunately Shyamalans script is so shallow that survival matters more than any solution. So Elliot and his wife (Zooey Deschanel) grab the abandoned daughter (Ashlyn Sanchez) of his best friend (John Leguizamo) and simply run from town to town in search of shelter. Shyamalan always serves as his own writer director and producer a choice that indicates either unfailing competence or extreme egotism. Lets just say that competence is in short supply here. The film never builds past its initial idea the references to 9/11 feel cheap the good actors are wasted and the bad ones are distracting (just try to ignore the mugging extras in every scene). Oddest of all the pacing is so amateurish that this thriller has hardly any actual thrills. The final explanation which comes as no surprise is more preposterous than profound. If you want to see a scary movie about humans wreaking havoc on their planet watch ""An Inconvenient Truth"" instead. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Night Shyamalan presents a garden of earthly horrors.  |  out of 4 stars June 12 2008 -- 505pm Photo by Zade Rosenthal / Twentieth Century Fox ""The Happening"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint You think you have problems with ragweed? In ""The Happening"" the stupefyingly silly new eco-thriller from M. Night Shyamalan the plant world rises up against humankind releasing an airborne toxin that causes mass suicide to sweep the East Coast. After an ominous first act the film dies on the vine. In an opening of Hitchcockian suspense pedestrians in New Yorks Central Park become disoriented and halt in their tracks then begin acting in bizarre self-destructive ways. The effect is almost punctured by an onlookers awkward dialogue (""Are those people clawing at themselves? That looks like blood"") but a sequence at a nearby building site where construction workers leap to their death evokes grim memories of 9/11. The ""event"" initially is considered a terrorist attack but as more and more neuro-toxin outbreaks are reported it becomes clear that something else is at work. Mark Wahlberg plays a high school science teacher who flees the city with his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and the daughter of a friend in tow. They avoid population centers prime targets for the contagion heading for smaller and smaller towns as the mind-scrambling poison nips at their heels. Soon theyre running for remote farmhouses and casting worried looks at the wind-rippled trees. Creating an environmental horror story with vegetation is harder than it sounds. Imagine ""The Birds"" without birds and you have a fair idea of the circumstances. As the film progresses were subjected to dozens of grisly deaths most shockingly a man wandering into the lion exhibit at the Philadelphia Zoo. But the focus stays on Wahlberg and Deschanel whose marriage is under some strain because of a mild flirtation. The attention paid to their piddling relationship woes vs. the entire fate of humanity is absurd. We never feel persuaded that they have a bond much less invested in seeing them patch it up. They just seem to be competing to see who can deliver the least convincing line readings. Deschanels emotional tone is all over the map irrationally chipper one moment and shell-shocked the next. Wahlberg so impressive in ""The Departed"" fares no better. A scene in which he has a tense conversation with a houseplant is a shoo-in for the most ridiculous minute of screen time to be filmed this year. The twist ending that was a fixture of earlier Shyamalan films is absent here. In fact theres hardly a finale at all merely a lazy coda that brings the situation full circle. ""The Happening"" never should have happened. THE HAPPENING  out of 4 stars Rating R for violent and disturbing images.

Comments The Happening John Leguizamo should be grateful his exit early on in the latest horror film from writer-director M. Night Shyamalan (Lady in the Water) means he escapes from the wreckage relatively unscathed. Not so for poor Mark Wahlberg who plays a Philadelphia science teacher who discovers that an east-coast suicide epidemic is being caused by angry flora. No need for an SFX budget; trees and grasses express their menace by blowing in the wind signaling humans to feed themselves to lions or lie down in front of rampaging lawn mowers. Wahlberg turns in one of his worst performances ever but then hes saddled with preposterous scenes (like one where he tries to placate a ficus) and such lame lines as ""Could this really be happening?"" Funny I was wondering the same thing myself. R 90 min.

"The Happening (R)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies The Happening (R)  With The Happening writer-director M. Night Shyamalan bounces back from some of his recent film failures. In this image released by Twentieth Century Fox Ashlyn Sanchez John Leguizamo center and Mark Wahlberg are shown in a scene from ""The Happening."" Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez Miami Herald With The Happening writer-director M. Night Shyamalan bounces back from the turgidness of The Village and the idiocy of Lady in the Water. The movie has a great Shyamalan-esque hook One otherwise normal morning in Central Park everyone starts to commit suicide and then the behavior starts to spread as if it were airborne throughout the Northeast. At the relatively safe distance of Philadelphia high school science teacher Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) and his increasingly distant wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) watch the news and try to make sense of what is transpiring. Is it a virus? Toxic gas? A terrorist attack? Just when you thought there couldnt be any more evil that could be invented Alma says sadly. Then people in Philly start killing themselves and the couple goes on the run with Elliots best friend (John Leguizamo) and his young daughter (Ashlyn Sanchez). But where to? Like War of the Worlds and Cloverfield The Happening pointedly invokes Sept. 11 in its evocation of Americans reacting to a large-scale incomprehensible calamity that has no precedent. As society quickly breaks down -- trains stop running TVs stop working the power goes out and the radio transmits static -- Shyamalan explores how an end-of-the-world scenario changes behavior turning us into shotgun-toting killers or desperate scared individuals struggling to make peace with the fact that the end is near. Halfway through the film before things have become truly dire Alma turns to her husband and confesses she had a slice of tiramisu with another man. Thats all she did -- she had dessert with him -- but the impending death of everyone and everything you know and love has a way of making the peas under the mattress suddenly feel intolerable. Even when his scripts arent working Shyamalan knows how to frame shots and build suspense. The Happening even more than his previous films has a visual elegance and subtlety that helps to overcome the less successful aspects of the plot. His camera often trains on banal subjects like sunlight pouring through a tear in the vinyl top of a convertible investing them with horrible meaning. He also photographs faces as effectively as Steven Spielberg often using close-ups to convey volumes like the expression on a little girls face as she is led to her apparent doom by the person in the world she trusts the most at that moment. This is not Shyamalans first violent film but it is his first R-rated movie and most of the time the graphic nature of the violence is effectively used. An early sequence in which construction workers start casually walking off the roof of a building is pure nightmare a rainstorm of human bodies landing on the ground with a sickening crunch. Theres only one instance in which a suicidal zoo keeper walks unarmed into a cage of lions where the gore feels gratuitous. The rest of the violence in The Happening is sudden and fleeting adding to the growing sense of dread and panic the movie builds at a quiet pace. Its that quietness that will test the patience of viewers who like their horror faster and furiouser. Like Signs The Happening is a subtle measured work which means there will be many who find it dull and pointless. The explanation about what is causing the mass suicides too is problematic Sticklers for plausibility and logic in their films -- even fantasies -- will find much to mock here. Shyamalan doesnt do himself any favors with a couple of unnecessary cutaway shots at critical moments intended to heighten suspense that raise chuckles instead. But why The Happening is happening is ultimately a MacGuffin for what Shyamalan is doing here. The movie has moments of unexpected humor (such as Elliots encounter with an artificial indoor plant) and occasionally detours into bizarre unnerving territory including Elliot and Almas meeting with an old recluse (Betty Buckley) who turns out to be even weirder than she seems. For all its apocalyptic terrors however The Happening shares the same theme as all of Shyamalans previous films The overriding importance of family and the way in which love can if not overcome any evil at least provide some umbrage from its terrors.

By Peter Rainer June 14 2008 Save for later Saved Remember that TV commercial with the punch line ""Its not nice to fool Mother Nature?"" M. Night Shyamalans ""The Happening"" is a glorified revamp of that old joke except this time its no joke. You were maybe expecting a laughfest from the auteur of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs""?The film opens chillingly. A lazy New York afternoon suddenly goes haywire as people in Central Park inexplicably freeze in their tracks and then kill themselves while construction workers fall headlong from rooftops. The survival instinct has mysteriously been overridden in these people by - what? A terrorist toxin? A top-secret military experiment gone horribly wrong?Every Shyamalan movie has its Everyman. Here its Philadelphia high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) who lectures his class on the puzzling recent diminishment of the honeybee population. This phenomenon is a sure sign - or should I say Sign - that somethings screwy in the ether. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Elliot is also puzzled about the diminishment of affection in his marriage to Alma (Zooey Deschanel) who doesnt need an airborne chemical toxin or bacterial outbreak - or whatever the blazes it is - to feel jumpy. Shes already deep in manic mode when danger strikes. Fearing an outbreak in the City of Brotherly Love she and Elliot along with high school math teacher and friend Julian (John Leguizamo) and his eight-year-old daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) head for the Pennsylvania farmlands. When the boonies turn out to be as unsafe as the cities the terrorist theory starts to crumble. Why would jihadists want to incinerate Filbert Pa.? Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Happening This is not one of those Shyamalan movies that sets you up for a surprise ending although it might have been better if it did. I kept trying to figure out if there were encoded switcheroos in the plot. Is ""Filbert"" a secret code for something? Is Julians wife trapped in Princeton N.J. because thats where Einstein was once ensconced? If the human drama was more compelling I wouldnt have been thinking these thoughts.Shyamalan was obviously going for a lean ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""-style 50s-ish thriller here. (It runs about 90 minutes and feels longer.) But the film which covers 36 hours is confusingly structured. Its never clear for example which areas of the Northeast are affected - the rest of the country is unharmed - or why the knocked-out cellphone and TV and radio reception suddenly snap to life whenever its convenient for the plot. Its also not clear if certain scenes such as those involving a gonzo horticulturist or a bonkers hermit (Betty Buckley) are meant to be funny or funny-scary.Even in a misfire like ""The Happening"" Shyamalan has a fine feeling for dread. He knows how to creep you out. But he has a tin ear for acting. This is especially damaging to the Elliot/Alma love story which is intended as the movies heart and soul. Normally a charming performer Deschanel comes across as a wide-eyed whiner while Wahlberg always best playing misfits overdoes the oh-my-gosh innocence.Its also a bit sneaky of Shyamalan to set us up for a paranoid 9/11 thriller and then go all Greenpeace on us. Hes trying to be socially conscious but he doesnt have the reformists temperament. He has the temperament of a self-infatuated messiah. In Filbert Pa. though I suspect that infatuation wont fly. Grade C (Rated R for violent and disturbing images.)

Zade Rosenthal/Twentieth Century Fox The Happening Director M. Night ShyamalanGenre SuspenseRunning Time 91 minutes Rated R for violent and disturbing images -- and perhaps as a come-on to the teens who are its natural audience. i Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) and dad Julian (John Leguizamo) find themselves troubled by the news from New York -- or perhaps by their dialogue. Zade Rosenthal/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Zade Rosenthal/Twentieth Century Fox Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) dad Julian (John Leguizamo) and Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) find themselves troubled by the news from New York -- or perhaps by their dialogue. Zade Rosenthal/Twentieth Century Fox People out strolling in Central Park on a beautiful summer day abruptly stop strolling and stand motionless. Then the dying starts Spikes thrusting into jugular veins cops putting revolvers to their own foreheads a weird aerial ballet of construction workers hurling themselves off 30-story buildings on the parks fringes -- suicide after suicide until theres no one left to die. As apocalypses go the one that opens The Happening is pretty arresting. But then it needs to be coming from writer-director M. Night Shyamalan whose Sixth Sense turned the artful explaining of the inexplicable into one of Tinseltowns more profitable cottage industries. Whether audiences will find Shyamalans explanations compelling this time is another question. The set-ups nifty the payoff problematic. As in the directors earlier films disquieting events are seen through the eyes of a small and increasingly isolated family group. In this case thatd be earnest Philadelphia science teacher Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) his not-quite-unfaithful wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and the plucky 6-year-old daughter (Ashlyn Sanchez) of another teacher (John Leguizamo) at Elliots school. (Hes gone off to find his own wife if youre wondering.) When the suicide epidemic starts spreading from New York this threesome heads out into the Pennsylvania countryside figuring thats got to be safer than waiting for folks to fall on them from Philly skyscrapers. But no matter where they turn there seem to be bodies piling up. Might the problem be an airborne neurotoxin? A terrorist attack? A random act of nature? A movie pitch run amok? Youll get no spoilers here. Wahlberg whose strength has always been onscreen naturalness should not have been required to ask urgent questions for 90 consecutive minutes but he manages to make some of the quasi-scientific nonsense Shyamalan has given him in lieu of dialogue sound like actual speech. Only toward the end of the film does he remotely connect with Deschanel who expresses her characters emotional constipation mostly by popping her eyes while pursing her lips. Both of them fare better than Leguizamo who cant seem to get a handle on how to play a teacher who meets certain death with math riddles. Shyamalan whose career has been offering ever-diminishing returns to audiences and to the studios who back him has lately been on a mission to repair his rep. He does not he told both The New York Times and Los Angeles Times want to be known as the ""guy who makes the scary movie with the twist"" -- a plaint that would seem more heartfelt if hed write or direct something other than a scary movie with a twist. (Yeah yeah I know Stuart Little. But that was nearly a decade ago). Actually as The Happening is neither terribly scary nor all that twisty he neednt have distressed himself. The bigger danger after The Village and The Lady in the Water is that hell become known as the guy who makes the inane movie with the risible premise. Fortunately he still has an eye for composition -- give him a reflective surface and hell layer information all over it and to the extent that a wind rustling tall grass can be made threatening he makes it threatening (with an assist from James Newton Howards seriously overwrought score). That said if what audiences are looking for is a thrill ride or even a pervasive eeriness The Happenings just not happening. Eco-Horror Green Panic on the Silver Screen?

Zade Rosenthal/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Zade Rosenthal/Twentieth Century Fox The Happenings Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) lectures on ecological catastrophe. Zade Rosenthal/Twentieth Century Fox While The Happening may not be happening for NPR film critic Bob Mondello the movie is another example of what appears to be a cinematic trend eco-horror. The Happenings central environmental catastrophe puts it in the company of other recent pictures -- think Sunshine or The Day After Tomorrow. In the next year or so we can expect to see Avatar directed by James Cameron and remakes of The Swarm and Creature from the Black Lagoon. Of course movies with environmental themes are nothing new. Back in the 70s -- another era defined by an oil crisis and discussions of alternative energy -- movie audiences entertained themselves with disaster movies (Earthquake) and creature features (Prophecy Frogs). What makes todays eco-horrors different is that the entire planet is seen as vengeful and malevolent towards its human inhabitants. Film scholar Kendall Phillips compares this crop of films to an old genre favorite haunted-house movies in which the house becomes a kind of character. ""Theyre just expanding that so literally; the ecosphere plays that kind of menacing role"" Phillips says. ""Somehow the planet has grown tired of us. Weve overstayed our welcome."" Happening director M. Night Shyamalan jokes that the quintessential horror film for our time might turn out to be a documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Another director of environmental horror films Larry Fessenden says he hopes people will see his movies as cautionary tales. ""We dont want to wake up in horrible super storms"" Fessenden says. ""We dont want to have wars over the last drop of water. We dont want our shores inundated with environmental refugees. We dont want to live in a horror film. We want to go to them at the movies -- and come out and have a sweet and beautiful life.""

Night Shyamalan. The big surprise in his latest feature The Happening is . . . there isnt one. Yes there is a mystery of a sort central to the story. But both its premise and solution such as it is are telegraphed from the start. Now thats unexpected. Instead of shocks we get moments of tension suspense and violence between stretches of running scared. Nothing wrong with that except that the stretches are awfully long in places. And in the end it all comes to not much. Sometimes the journey is the reward; thats generally not the case with horror movies. The story begins in Central Park where the wind picks up and people suddenly are walking backward and acting strangely. Dangerously strangely. Might want to stay away from open windows and sharp objects. Meanwhile Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is teaching science in a Philadelphia school. He asks his students Why are bees disappearing? Timely question. Moores school is evacuated as a precaution; its assumed that the weirdness in New York was caused by a terrorist attack. Soon Elliot is on a train out of town with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and Julians daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). But trouble follows. The entire northeastern United States is being affected. Why? If only we had access to you know a science teacher or something. . . . Oh yeah Elliot is an ingenious sort and figures out that the best bet for survival is the antithesis of horror-movie behavior People need to split up not stick together. Like the overarching premise its interesting. Is Shyamalan taking a nihilistic view of society of humanity? Are we really better off apart than together? Who knows? It comes off more as simply a plot device than a social statement and is never really explored beyond that. Thats too bad. Otherwise were left with the Big Picture Items - paranoia mans mistreatment of nature that kind of thing. An inverted sense of what it takes to survive would have been an interesting twist. And twists are something Shyamalan is comfortable with obviously. Wahlberg is pleasantly bland as Elliot. Deschanel is somewhat more interesting as his wife though the marital rough patch theyre going through has a ridiculous why-bother feel to it. Betty Buckley is really good in a small role as a nutcase living out in the middle of nowhere offering a little shelter a little passive-aggressive behavior a little potentially useful plot information. The same goes for Frank Collison as a nursery owner Elliot and crew hitch a ride with. Hes sort of an idiot savant with a weird obsession with things such as hot dogs. But as for the bigger problem he just may be onto something. So whats the feint? Whats the jaw-dropper? Failing that whats caused all this destruction and mayhem? We get educated guesses and heavy-handed suggestions - talk nicely to that plant in your cubicle how about? - by way of that dependable font of information cable-news talk shows. But we dont get a satisfying explanation. Bring back the surprise ending if this is the alternative. And dont forget to recycle.

Night Shyamalan; Author M. Night Shyamalan; Release Date Wide 06/13/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 99; MPAA Rating R Posted June 20 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT Something in the air is turning normal people into self-destructive crazies prone to flinging themselves off buildings and blowing their brains out. That much at least can be shared about The Happening a feature-length Twilight Zone episode in which a high school science teacher (Mark Wahlberg constricted) his flighty wife (Zooey Deschanel of the big blue eyes) and an Innocent Little Girl in their care (Ashlyn Sanchez nearly mute) face down an epidemic of death rampaging through the Northeast. Supposedly the cause of the catastrophe is unknown -- it might be the work of terrorists a virus a toxin in the air or the legacy of nuclear malfeasance. In fact its a cinch for any moviegoer familiar with the post-Sixth Sense oeuvre of writer-director M. Night Shyamalan to diagnose the situation as an advancing case of crippling Shyamalania. Some sure symptoms The movie demonstrates a smart movie geeks obsession with the rhythms and gory details of horror storytelling undermined by a pompous insistence on spiritual lessons of the tritest kind (dont be mean to Mother Nature Trust in love). And the filmmaker has fun with the cinematic conventions of social paranoia (all his most interesting minor characters with unusual faces are surely doomed) but is a sucker for overacting among his major players. I dont know what thespian virus is eating Betty Buckley as an ornery country loner but I hope its not contagious.
