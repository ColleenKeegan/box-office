All Rights Reserved. Does Eddie Murphy actually have any range or is it just an illusion created by a few early edgy roles and later a lot of CGI makeup and fat suits? In A Thousand Words the comedian doesnt do his usual thing of playing multiple parts (a la Dr. Doolittle or The Nutty Professor) but he does have to run the full gamut of shtick as he is transformed from Uber-con fident motormouth to hapless victim of karmic circumstance to earnest Changed Man(tm). But his performance feels so disingenuous so forced that an otherwise perfectly acceptable high-concept comedy comes crashing down around him. Murphy plays Jack McCall a powerful book agent and neglectful family man who prides himself on his powers of coercion and his total lack of genuine interest in the product he pimps. (""All your best books have everything you need in the first five pages and the last five pages"" he smugly tells his hard-working assistant played by Clark Duke.) Attempting to sign a popular guru (Cliff Curtis) who has reportedly written a book Jack lies a little too much and before he knows it a mysterious tree has sprouted in front of his house. Jack it turns out has become one with the tree A leaf falls with every word he utters so that when all the leaves are gone and the tree has died so will he. (Never mind the fact that trees dont die when all their leaves are gone but whatever.) In other words our alpha male can no longer use his voice -- not to negotiate a deal with Random House not to sign a new client not to bond with his son not even to tell his wife (Kerry Washington) he loves her when she tries to interest him in a little Samp;M (no really). Every once in a while he blurts out something but most of the time Jack has to make do with silent buffoonery. In one of the films funnier scenes Jack McBrayer shows up as a Starbucks barista who tries to follow our heros elaborate charadeslike order. Thus do the mighty understand the consequences of their words. Really its a cute idea and you imagine that at one point a film like this might have marked Murphys return to form. (It has reportedly sat on a shelf for the last several years a victim of the various legal entanglements between Dreamworks and Paramount.) It could have been a clever Liar Liar-like blend of physical humor and audience-friendly messaging. But all those years of acting opposite animals and CGI effects for the kiddies appear to have taken their toll on the actor He hams it up to such an unnatural degree that he scrubs every moment clean of wit or charm. Hes trying so hard to make us laugh that we feel almost afraid to. To be fair the movie gives him a lot to do and Murphy still has a lot of energy One moment hes a slick power player the next moment hes a nervous chatterbox trying to weasel his way out of an awkward lie. Even when dealing with his supernatural/moral conundrum he has to veer between confident duplicity and wide-eyed helplessness. But he steamrolls every scene with his mugging and its hard to reconcile this exhausting cartoonish display with the jaded Murphy of yore who was just above it all enough to charm our way onto his side. Now he merely alienates us. And that makes A Thousand Words another in a line of dispiriting failures -- a star vehicle where the star ruins the movie.

Daily Edition Login to download A Thousand Words Film Review 1228 PM PST 3/9/2012 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Eddie Murphy should have just said the word ""No"" to this tired formulaic comedy. TWITTER Kerry Washington Allison Janney and Cliff Curtis co-star in the long-delayed Paramount feature about a literary agent who finds out he has a limited number of words he can speak or write. Eddie Murphy continues his dispiriting career slide with A Thousand Words directed Brian Robbins with whom he collaborated on such equally misbegotten efforts as Meet Dave and Norbit. This long-delayed purported comedy -- its been on the shelf for close to four years -- is the latest example of how the talented performers poor choice of material continually undercuts him. Murphy plays Jack McCall a self-absorbed sleazebag agent -- seemingly the only kind that exists according to Hollywood. A literary agent who doesnt bother to read books the role is one that the actor presumably prepared for Method-style since he clearly didnt bother to read the script. In between ignoring his wife (Kerry Washington) and abusing his long-suffering assistant (Clark Duke) Jack attempts to sign a Deepak Chopra-like spiritual guru Dr. Sinja (Cliff Curtis) unaware that his much-anticipated book is a mere five pages long. In the process of using his usual slick patter to woo Dr. Sinja whos clearly aware of his tricks Jack cuts himself on a tree that later magically springs up in his backyard garden. He soon finds out that a leaf falls off for every word he speaks or writes and when its finally barren he dies. PHOTOS 15 Oscar Icons Remember the Night That Changed Their Lives Forever Dr. Sinja advises him to simply stop speaking for a few days until a solution can be found. But that would have made for a much shorter film. So Jack instead attempts to go about his daily business -- which includes such high-pressure situations as singing at his childs playgroup -- by using a combination of mimed gestures and animalistic grunts. Faced with a problem afflicting any number of people who suffer from a temporary bout of laryngitis he quickly manages to lose his job and alienate everyone in his life. That is until he has a spiritual conversion and becomes you guessed it a better man. Murphy certainly cant be accused of walking through the film. He puts great effort into this feature-length version of charades with his wild gesticulations and constant mugging occasionally scoring mild laughs. But the formulaic script by Steve Koren doesnt manage to exploit the absurd premise with any discernible wit or invention and the star is left floundering. As the baby-faced assistant whose every attempt to be helpful backfires Duke fairly steals the film right out from under Murphy though admittedly the crime is little more than a misdemeanor. Curtis is drolly amusing as the guru but Washington and Allison Janney have little to contribute in their supporting roles and the great Ruby Dee is wasted as Jacks dementia-addled mother who figures in a would-be touching subplot. Among the films many producers is Nicolas Cage. How he managed to dodge the bullet of starring in it is anybodys guess.

After a run-in with an Indian guru he becomes the victim of a karmic curse A tree sprouts in his backyard and every time he utters a word one of its leaves falls off. (If all the leaves fall hell die.) The movie in other words takes an Eddie Murphy who talks very very fast (what a concept) and turns him into an Eddie Murphy who cant allow himself to talk at all (what an even less entertaining concept). In theory A Thousand Words should draw on its stars abilities as a physical comedian but Murphy miming his order for a triple latte at Starbucks comes off like Charlie Chaplin on crystal meth; hes strenuously unfunny to watch. The movie also makes virtually no sense With a thousand words at his disposal couldnt Murphy take at least one sentence to explain whats happening to his wife (Kerry Washington)? And why does no one even question why he has suddenly stopped talking? The only answer is that everyone in the film seems to be living in Stupid High-Concept Movieville. Theres one halfway amusing scene in which Murphy uses talking action figures (Austin Powers the Terminator) to speak for him during a conference call but most of A Thousand Words is profoundly tedious. It makes you want to see Murphy team up with Judd Apatow or even take on a deadly serious dramatic role -- do anything but star in another movie like this one.

The man behind the Eddie Murphy trifecta of Norbit Meet Dave and this weekends A Thousand Words opens this latest high-concept blend of magic and mawkishness (to be released anyway - this was shot back in 2008) with a shot of Murphys family in a broken picture frame. Before his Jack McCall even utters his first words of solemn narration you could guess that hes a workaholic dad overdue for a lesson in What Really Matters and you wouldnt be wrong. Of course formulas like these can be forgiven if granted a touch of cleverness or flair in execution but again that has never exactly Robbins directorial forte. Hes mostly here to make sure that were treated to garish close-ups of Starbucks Coffee cups as Jack proclaims how delicious it is to make sure that co-star Allison Janney is in frame when Murphy proceeds to insert a breadstick into her nostril during an Important Business Meeting to make sure that we see the distinct outline of an elderly mans crotch after were inexplicably informed that this gent wears his pants much too tight. What does all of this have to do with life lessons? Who knows. Heres what you need to know fast-talking literary agent McCall tries to rope in New Age guru Dr. Sinja (Cliff Curtis) into a lucrative book deal for which Jack ends up burdened with a mystical tree in his backyard. For his every spoken or written word the tree loses a leaf. (Even middle fingers take their toll.) For every action taken out on its trunk Jack experiences an identical reaction. Ergo if the tree becomes bare it dies and so does our harried businessman/neglectful family man. Its a glorified excuse for celebrity charades and other antics; tree-crawling squirrels cause Jack to be ticklish at the most inopportune times while pesticide-spraying gardeners result in his being quasi-stoned at said Important Business Meeting (of which there are many). During a conference call he has talking action figures speak on his behalf... and other grown adults fall for it. This is the comedy folks. Devoted assistant Clark Duke spastically confessing to a furry fetish is what passes for funny here; the same goes for ""come hither"" looks from a shirtless fat man in an elevator. To be fair its not as if Murphy doesnt throw himself into the gags wholesale whether hes mugging wildly mouthing orders to spouses and bosses who dont understand or spewing leaves from his mouth in a nightmare. Even when the last act turns into the requisite redemption arc and Robbins lays the schmaltz on thick - down to a grim and thus laughable bottoming-out sequence that sees Jack attempting suicide by means of singing - Murphy taps into something wounded in a movie that otherwise specifically robs him of his chief comedic gift his mouth. And one can only imagine that the chief reason that supporting players like Duke Janney Curtis Kerry Washington and Jack McBrayer signed on was simply to say that they had the chance to work with a comedic god dire circumstances be damned. Coming from scribe Steve Koren (Bruce Almighty Click) Words follows directly in the footsteps of those films not to mention Liar Liar Groundhog Day and any other post-Freaky Friday high-concept redemption story that inevitably crossed Tim Allen and Adam Sandlers desks at some point. It wouldnt have been any funnier in 2008 or even 1998. It wouldnt have been much funnier with anyone besides Murphy in the lead role. Its a ready-made blueprint for mediocrity that brings new meaning to ""That goes without saying"" and is perhaps better left without having actually been seen.

"A Thousand Words Eddie Murphy film is not the comeback vehicle his fans crave |       NJ.com comments A Thousand Words Eddie Murphy film is not the comeback vehicle his fans crave Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 09 2012 at 801 AM View/Post Comments Bruce McBroom/DreamWorks Pictures Allison Janney plays Samantha Davis and Eddie Murphy plays Jack McCall in ""A Thousand Words."" The most important thing in comedy is timing and Eddie Murphy used to have some of the best. But recently he seems out of sync -- or maybe just out of luck. He finally broke out of the kiddie-film trap to bring back the old Eddie -- with his hee-haw laugh and slashing profane wit -- in ""Tower Heist."" It flopped. He was set to host the Oscars -- and then when the guy who got him the gig stepped down under pressure he loyally resigned too sticking us with Billy Crystal. If ""Heist"" had hit if the Oscars had gone forward -- well then wed have already welcomed back Murphy in style and be treating ""A Thousand Words"" as an awkward leftover from the bad old days. Actually it is a leftover -- the film was made four years ago. But it also sadly seems like a sign of whats ahead. The picture is yet another one of those gimmicky comedies in which some shallow self-centered guy has for no particular reason a spell put on him that causes him to tell the truth switch bodies with a friend or do something equally inconvenient. This causes troubles at work (until he loses his job) and at home (until he loses his wife or girlfriend). Oh and theres also a lot of silly slapstick and at least one scene of public humiliation invariably at a high-stakes business meeting. But eventually just when all seems lost our hero Learns His Lesson (be grateful for what you have dont be such a jerk money isnt everything). And just like that the curse is lifted the credits roll -- and you walk out of the theater grumbling. Plug in a few new details (the guys a book agent his problem is daddy issues and the spell means every word he says brings him closer to death) and youve got ""A Thousand Words."" What you dont have is a funny movie. Apparently happy not to be in another kiddie flick Murphy works hard making faces doing little dances and exploding in comic (and once not-so-comic) rage. Hes still a great entertainer (as his should-have-won-an-Oscar performance in ""Dreamgirls"" proved). But this material is beneath him and us. Directed by Brian Robbins -- the auteur behind ""Meet Dave"" ""Norbit"" and that Tim Allen mongrel ""The Shaggy Dog"" -- the movie has no edge or wit. Anything with potential to move the film in that direction -- Murphys latest book deal involves a self-help tome from a mystic guru -- is quickly quashed. And when Murphy is forced to go back to his childhood in some cuddly Spielbergian flashback theres so much mystical light faux-naive wisdom and feel-good validation you feel youve suddenly wandered into an awful old Robin Williams movie. There are some good actors here including Allison Janney (in a mirthless role as Murphys boss) and Kerry Washington who briefly shows up in a dominatrix outfit (and yes a reminder -- this is not another one of Murphys family comedies). And there is a lovely appearance by Ruby Dee. She plays Murphys aged mother battling Alzheimers disease and losing and there isnt a scene that this 88-year-old legend doesnt fill with grace and real feeling often with just a look. She doesnt need words to act. But Murphy doesnt need any more movies like this if hes ever going to really revive his career. Ratings note The film contains strong language alcohol abuse sensuality and drug references. A Thousand Words (PG-13) Paramount (91 min.) Directed by Brian Robbins. With Eddie Murphy Kerry Washington. Now playing in New Jersey.

(Bruce McBroom/AP/Paramount) Eddie Murphy in a scene from ""A Thousand Words.""(Bruce McBroom/AP/Paramount) Movie review A Thousand Words Odd plot leaves a motor-mouth speechless Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 09 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Give the creators of A Thousand Words credit for thinking way outside the box How about Eddie Murphy with his mouth clamped shut? The idea of taking one of Hollywoods best-known motor-mouths and reducing him to mugging and charades is definitely novel - and utterly misguided. For A Thousand Words first half-hour Murphy jams in as many words as possible playing Jack a huckster literary agent who lives in a lavish California home with his pretty wife (Kerry Washington) and baby son. Determined to land New Age guru Dr. Sinja (Cliff Curtis) as a client Jack visits the gurus ashram and deceptively persuades him to let him sell Dr. Sinjas potentially best-selling book. For his lies Jack is cursed a bodhi tree appears in his back yard and whenever he says a word the tree loses a leaf. Worse Jack discovers that when all the leaves are gone he will die. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new comedy ""A Thousand Words"" starring Eddie Murphy Movies A Thousand Words The official trailer Eddie Murphy. AP Movies Video Eddie Murphy on keeping quiet This is the incentive for a series of barely connected set-pieces in which Murphy mugs and makes hand signals to get around the word problem. He pretends to squeeze an imaginary breast to order extra milk for his coffee at Starbucks and uses his wind-up Austin Powers doll to give affirmative answers on the telephone. For some reason he shares the secret about his curse with his nerdy assistant (Clark Duke) but he shuts up around his bewildered wife. At one point she decides the best way to get him to communicate more is to dress up in a patent-leather bikini and meet him in a hotel room a scene which serves no other purpose than to ogle Washington in fetish gear. At best A Thousand Words directed by Brian Robbins ( Meet Dave Norbit) is perversely interesting as the latest misstep in Murphys checkered career following the flops of Meet Dave and Imagine That and the partial comeback of Tower Heist. A Thousand Words was delayed from its original release date in 2008 to take advantage of Murphy acting as this years Academy Awards show host (he resigned that position when producer Brett Ratner dropped out). This was apparently intended as an inspirational film as much as a comic one. The premise similar to such Jim Carrey comedies as Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty (screenwriter Steve Koren also wrote Bruce Almighty) attempts to show the clown with a sensitive side. A couple of scenes include Jack visiting his mother (Ruby Dee) who has Alzheimers disease and mistakes Jack for his deadbeat father. In another scene Jack gets drunk and angry singing along with Teddy Pendergrass. And near the end of the film Jack has an out-of-body experience in kitschy overly lit scenes evocative of The Lovely Bones or even The Tree of Life. For a comedy about the quest for inner peace A Thousand Words reeks of desperation.

Crazy story I know but lately its like every day the exact same thing happens clock radio goes off I get out of bed I go to the movies and see . . . a rip-off of another movie. When they came in to pitch ""A Thousand Words"" no doubt by calling it "" Jerry Maguire meets Groundhog Day "" a studio exec should have raised the palm of rejection and said ""When you stop being sadly derivative and write an original idea thats as good as those two come back."" Eddie Murphy plays a character so trite even Jim Carrey will eventually tire of playing the type albeit not soon enough. Hes Jack McCall -- a cynical fast-talking literary agent. The worst things Jack does are to talk too much and drag his feet when his wife (Kerry Washington) suggests moving out of their non-babyproof bachelor pad for the sake of their new son. Jack protests that their son doesnt mind ""Hes a bachelor"" What a devil. He needs life lessons from a superstar spiritual guru named Sinja (Cliff Curtis) whose book Jack wants to represent not realizing the material in question is only five pages. (Ha-ha Jack doesnt read He leaves all that boring stuff to his stressed-out assistant who is played with heroic but futile dedication by the talented Clark Duke.) While meeting with Sinja (and doing yoga in full business attire -- stop youre killing me its all too wacky) Jack cuts his hand on a tree that later appears in his own yard. Every time Jack says or writes a word a leaf falls off the tree and when consulted the holy man figures that there are a thousand leaves left and when theyre all gone Jack will die. Sinja says hell be back in three days with more clues and a back story so instead of spending a few words explaining things to his wife and calling in sick at work Jack naturally tries to carry on as usual. This involves excruciating mugging flustered sign language misunderstandings with colleagues occasional screaming at the tree suicidal thoughts and (when all else fails) being a nice guy. Even 2003 Robin Williams would have thunked this script in the fireplace by page 50 (though to be fair 2011 Robin Williams would probably burn the fur off his forearms reaching into the fire to rescue it). ""A Thousand Words"" isnt even consistent; in a development familiar from ""E.T."" Jack begins to feel whatever the tree is feeling no matter where he is. Strike it with an ax and he gets a gash in his side. Yet in one scene when the tree is watered Jack bursts out sweating; in another he doesnt and the only reason for the difference is that the former seeks to be comical (it isnt) and the latter to be soulful (it fails). In the last third of the movie most of which is shot in a golden haze suggesting a 1991 Massengill commercial we learn more about what makes Jack who he really is deep down inside a screenwriters attempt to get rich via shameless pandering. Jack believes that the secret to being an agent is to read merely the first and last five pages of everything that comes in. But thats not what an agent does Its what the executives who greenlit this film did. You can tell they were bored by this feeble property and for a change the enthusiasm level of the suits was fully justified.

Starring Eddie Murphy Allison Janney Clark Duke Jordan-Claire Green Philip Pavel Eshaya Draper Jackie Geary Mitchell Fink Edi Patterson Rob Evors Director Brian Robbins Running time 131 Release Opened Mar 9 2012  Editorial Review Thousand Words Picture not worth them By Mark JenkinsSaturday Mar. 10 2012With so many comedians babbling away on the big screen filmmakers have to keep devising ways to make their chatter seem to matter. In ""The Invention of Lying"" Ricky Gervais played the only man in the world who could fib. Jim Carrey was a guy forced to tell the truth in ""Liar Liar"" and one who agreed to everything in ""Yes Man."" Now in ""A Thousand Words"" Eddie Murphy portrays a motormouth L.A. hustler who must give up talking - or die. As the members of ""The Artist"" team polish their Oscars this might be a good time for Murphy to shut up. Dialogue hasnt worked out all that well for him in his last dozen or so flicks. But ""A Thousand Words"" directed by ""Norbit"" survivor Brian Robbins isnt an example of the new silent cinema; its a long-shelved project that was actually shot back in 2008. Murphy spews enough verbiage for an entire movie in the comedys first 15 minutes and uses most of his remaining 1000 words in the next 70. Murphys Jack McCall is a powerhouse literary agent who doesnt stop talking long enough to read the books he pitches to major publishers. His latest target is Dr. Sinja (Cliff Curtis) a stadium-packing vaguely Indian new age guru. Sinja isnt as profound as a great Zen master but he is as wily. He presents Jack with an unmarketably terse five-page book and a mystical Bodhi tree. The tree it turns out is psychically grafted to Jack. It loses a leaf every time he releases a word and both tree and man will perish when the last leaf falls. The injunction on speech even includes writing so Jack cant cover for his sudden reticence with texts and tweets. He can only use sign language animal noises and goofy faces. This is a problem not only at work but also at home where Jacks wife Caroline (Kerry Washington) has picked exactly this moment to insist that her husband communicate better. More bland than actively bad ""A Thousand Words"" has a few nice moments. Curtis Washington and Clark Duke (as Jacks wanna-be assistant and later surrogate mouth) do what they can with the sit-com script. Sure there are cheap sex gags and broad slapstick routines but the movie seems sincere about its self-help-book moral. Sincere yet too conventional to experience its own spiritual breakthrough. When a transformed Jack asks Caroline to listen to the silence what the audience hears is not silence but syrupy movie music. Even when ""A Thousand Words"" is counseling us to just be quiet and in the moment it cant just be quiet and in the moment.Contains profanity kinky sexual situations and drug-related humor.

Credit Bruce McBroom/Paramount -- DreamWorks Pictures Among the many lessons in ""A Thousand Words"" is how to manufacture a slick and generic Hollywood comedy-drama. In the simplicity of its premise it embodies the notion of high-concept entertainment. In its execution it demonstrates how technical efficiency can drain the life from a story.Eddie Murphy plays Jack McCall a Type A literary agent who like Ari Gold on ""Entourage"" abuses his loyal assistant (an amusing Clark Duke) in his quest to seal a deal sparing no time for his wife (Kerry Washington) and young son. As he courts a New Age guru (Cliff Curtis) for a book a magical tree appears in his backyard. Anything it experiences he experiences a watering; a dousing with powerful chemicals; a chop to its trunk. Worse it sheds a leaf for every word Jack utters bringing both him and the tree closer to death.Bring on the comic pantomime as the anguished Jack alienates clients and his officious boss (Allison Janney). Add the perennially appealing Ruby Dee for dramatic heft as Jacks declining mother pining for the husband who left her. And unleash the platitudes about the values of silence listening and forgiveness. And dont forget diffuse light and lush orchestral swells to hammer the sentiment home.Mr. Murphys mugging skills at times evoking Harpo Marx are in fine fettle and he easily finds Jacks dark undercurrents. But the director Brian Robbins perhaps as a result of his prime-time pedigree has so carefully engineered this manipulative machine that little emotional residue remains -- only a product inoffensive unsurprising and uninspiring.""A Thousand Words"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language drug allusions and sexual situations.

The tale of a smooth-talking self-absorbed book agent forced to turn over a new leaf when he finds that every utterance brings him one step closer to death ""A Thousand Words"" springs from the seed of an interesting idea that the ideal Eddie Murphy movie might be one in which the actor keeps his mouth shut. Alas even Murphys largely wordless physically adroit performance cant redeem this tortured exercise in high-concept spiritualist hokum which suggests a cross between ""Liar Liar"" and Shel Silversteins ""The Giving Tree"" but with more kitsch and gay jokes. Commercial prospects look none too fertile. Finally opening nearly four years after its completion this Paramount release of a DreamWorks title -- one of numerous projects left up in the air in the wake of the two companies messy 2008 divorce -- was initially shelved to distance it from Murphys back-to-back flops ""Meet Dave"" (2008) and ""Imagine That"" (2009). Though it reteams the actor with ""Meet Dave"" and ""Norbit"" helmer Brian Robbins ""A Thousand Words"" bears a stronger resemblance to ""Imagine That"" another blandly sentimental fable of self-improvement in which supernatural forces conspire to turn a slick company man into father-of-the-year material. A high-powered literary agent who never reads Jack McCall (Murphy) applies his fast-talking relentlessly superficial style to every aspect of his life. Strutting and talking a blue streak wherever he goes he never lets his shrink (Lou Saliba) get a word in edgewise mistreats his eager-to-please assistant (Clark Duke) and neglects his increasingly disgruntled wife Caroline (Kerry Washington) and their young son (Emanuel Ragsdale). But Jack is forced to confront his shortcomings when he signs influential New Age guru Dr. Sinja (a droll Cliff Curtis) shortly after which a large tree suddenly sprouts in Jacks backyard faster than a beanstalk and no less life-altering. To his alarm the tree sheds a leaf for every word he speaks leading Dr. Sinja to conclude that Jack has approximately 1000 words left before the tree is bare and his life is presumably finished. The rest of the film amounts to a feature-length game of charades as Jack attempts to negotiate a series of high-stakes professional and personal situations while saying as little as possible. In an especially cruel twist even the act of writing depletes Jacks word quota making it all the harder for him to explain his preposterous dilemma to others and calling forth from Murphy a typically agile display of spastic body language exasperated facial twitches and other tried-and-true forms of physical shtick. Yet if the pic means to teach a lesson about the importance of choosing ones words wisely Steve Korens screenplay cant be accused of practicing what it preaches. Even overlooking the lumbering predictability of Jacks redemption the comedy feels as forced and flat-footed as the uplift and scenes of tense marital discord and drippy dream sequences sit uncomfortably alongside slapstick hijinks and a few smirkingly homophobic gags. The inspirational messages imparted to Jack and the audience -- love your wife and kids; resolve your festering daddy issues; speak with actions not words -- are slathered on with a trowel. The solid supporting cast does as much with the material as possible. Making the most of his scene-stealing opportunities is Duke who takes his nervous-dweeb routine to amusing ends while Curtis manages to invest a white-robed stereotype with droll humor and attitude. The women by contrast are joke-free Ruby Dee is sealed in grave dignified amber as Jacks dementia-stricken mother while Washington is notably ill served as Caroline a total pill whose happiness is little more than a checkbox on her husbands self-help agenda. In the end Jacks metaphysical speech impediment scarcely matters so thoroughly does ""A Thousand Words"" enable and encourage the characters narcissism. Tech credits are fine if unremarkable. Robbins frequently plants Murphy dead-center in the widescreen frame the flat inactivity surrounding his frantic emoting furthering the sense of the performance as the pics one and only trick.

By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated Comments Reprints amp; Permissions It doesnt take much verbiage to sum up A Thousand Words ( 1/2 out of four rated PG-13 opens Friday nationwide) bad.By Bruce McBroom Paramount Pictures/DreamWorks PicturesPhoning it in Eddie Murphy offers a lackluster performance in the unoriginal comedy A Thousand Words.EnlargeCloseBy Bruce McBroom Paramount Pictures/DreamWorks PicturesPhoning it in Eddie Murphy offers a lackluster performance in the unoriginal comedy A Thousand Words.Sponsored LinksThis Eddie Murphy comedy is essentially 1997s Liar Liar with the presence of a guru who provides lackluster words of wisdom.The concept is unoriginal the scenarios arent funny and its message is banal. Plus Murphy alternately hams it up and phones it in.VIDEO Murphy left speechless in WordsMurphy is Jack McCall a self-absorbed fast-talking literary agent who can talk anyone into anything. He ignores his wife (Kerry Washington) skips out on baby chores and berates his assistant (Clark Duke).His ethics are sorely lacking. Hell say anything to get what he wants even lying that his wife is in labor with twins so he can bypass a long line at Starbucks. (The product placement is particularly pronounced Starbucks figures into several useless scenes.)About the movieA Thousand Words 1/2 out of fourStars Eddie Murphy Cliff Curtis Kerry Washington Clark Duke Allison Janney Director Brian Robbins Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG-13 for sexual situations including dialogue language and some drug-related humor Running time 1 hour 31 minutes Opens Friday nationwideJack is not only selfish hes lazy scanning only a few pages of the works of the authors he represents. He decides that his next literary coup will be a book by popular New Age guru Dr. Sinja (Cliff Curtis). He has no interest in Sinjas philosophy but joins a group of people absorbing Sinjas counsel amid yoga poses.While everyone else is clad in loose white garb Jack is wearing tight-fitting black. The obvious message of good and evil open and uptight is made even more obvious when Jack fakes a mystical vision during a yoga meditation. He yells screams and carries on to denote his moment of zen. But of course its all about dollar signs.The guru initially resists him then decides to let Jack publish his book to teach him a life lesson. Handily for Jack Sinjas book is only five pages long.But thats not the worst of Jacks problems. The smooth operators life is turned around by a mystical Bodhi tree that appears in his yard. Each time Jack utters a word a leaf falls off and Jack is convinced that when all the leaves are gone hell die. So about two-thirds of the movie consists of Murphy mugging gesticulating and finding alternate ways to communicate. All this is meant to be outrageous and hilarious and it might have been perhaps sporadically funny -- had the situations not been predictable forced and inane.At one point his wife begs him to talk but his fear of death trumps even his concerns over his crumbling marriage. Her words sum up the general exasperation of viewers ""Enough with the pointing and the grunting."" For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

"Review Murphys Thousand Words should shut up - Boston.com Life Itself | Glass Animals Listen Live Boston.com HomeTodays GlobeNewsYour TownBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal Estate Movies Restaurants Music Theater/Art Television Celebrity news Events Games Comics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Review Murphys Thousand Words should shut up By David Germain AP Movie Writer / March 8 2012 E-mail| Print| Text size - + E-mail E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. In the opening sequence of ""A Thousand Words"" Eddie Murphy starts with his back to the camera then turns abruptly to reveal a strip of duct tape over his mouth.A very good idea if the once hip fast-talker of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" is going to continue using hollow stumbling comedies such as this as his mouthpiece to the world.The notion of taking away motor-mouth Murphys ability to spew words sounds like a bizarre filmmaking choice until you encounter the obnoxious clown he plays here boorish literary agent and inattentive family man Jack McCall. Hes so annoying youll be aching for the moment the action comes around to that opening image when the duct tape gets slapped over Jacks mouth. That would be so hell hold his tongue after a bodhi tree magically appears in his backyard and begins losing leaves each time he utters a word and he learns through a gurus mystical guesswork that when the last leaf falls hell die.Oh yeah. About that plot. What left field did this senseless story from screenwriter Steve Koren (""Jack and Jill"") come out of? And why didnt Murphy director Brian Robbins and a team of producers including Nicolas Cage weed it out before it took root in theaters that would be better used showing retrospectives of Murphys ""Nutty Professor"" flicks or even his dreadful ""Norbit.""""A Thousand Words"" which was made in 2008 yet sat on the shelf until now is a movie built on drivel. Murphys Jack is a jerk but a run-of-the-mill jerk making the filmmakers effort to build some sort of cosmic cautionary warning around him feel like overkill like taking a Garden Weasel into the kitchen to toss a salad.Heres where Jacks at as the film opens Hes the ace at his literary agency not through sleaziness but just through rude crude pushiness. He clearly loves his wife (Kerry Washington) and young son but hes not good at the family thing yet and needs to man up a bit. Hes got a mother (Ruby Dee) whose memory is slipping but is well-cared for at a lovely facility where he visits her dutifully. He treats his assistant (Clark Duke) and others in his circle like personal serfs though hes more neglectful than abusive about it.All in all a thoughtless loudmouth but certainly not a terrible man.When he tries to sign superstar self-help guru Sinja (Cliff Curtis) as a book client he gets a few mild gibes about his lifestyle from the spiritual guide. Next thing you know a bodhi tree from Sinjas retreat transplants itself to Jacks backyard a leaf dropping for each word Jack utters or writes. Sinja guesstimates there are a thousand leaves left and that when the last one falls Jack will croak.What? Umm OK. It apparently made sense to Murphy and the filmmakers including Robbins who previously directed him in ""Norbit"" and the flop ""Meet Dave.""They strain to sow laughs out of this thin pointless idea with dumb slapstick and pratfalls and a lot of wordless mugging by Murphy who proves he can be just as insufferable when hes not talking as when he is. Along the way we get simple-minded moralizing about whats important in life family humility generosity treating people with respect -- all the stuff that Eddie Murphy stands for.Dee almost brings a few moments of grace to the movie until you remember what movie shes in then you just feel sad shes there at all. Its equally sad to see Allison Janney wasting her presence as Jacks boss.Jacks a guy whos not worth the universes extreme spiritual ministrations. His storys not worth your time. And ""A Thousand Words"" is not worth any more dismissive words. It needs to make like a tree and leave.""A Thousand Words"" a DreamWorks film distributed by Paramount release is rated PG-13 for sexual situations including dialogue language and some drug related humor.

A Thousand Words Bad Director Brian Robbins. Cast Eddie Murphy Kerry Washington Cliff Curtis. Rating PG-13 for sexual situations including dialogue language and some drug-related humor. Well that dream was nice while it lasted. With ""A Thousand Words"" Murphy plunges headlong back into the swamp of insipid comedies hed just crawled his way out of. With him for the ride is director Brian Robbins who also directed Murphy in Razzie Award nominees ""Norbit"" and ""Meet Dave."" Murphy plays Jack McCall a smooth-talking literary agent with little time for anything outside of scoring his next big deal. Clamoring for attention on the sidelines are his wife Caroline (Kerry Washington) and his toddler son. Jack is the sort of husband who agrees to let his wife lightly decorate and child-proof his swanky glass-and-concrete bachelor pad so long as her embellishments are ""mid-century modern."" Nice guy. His shtick doesnt go over so well with New Age guru Dr. Sinja (Cliff Curtis) an uninspired caricature of a vaguely Eastern non-denominational spiritual healer with a new book that Jack is desperate to buy. An idle fib here a broken promise there and suddenly theres a magical Bodhi tree in Jacks backyard that sheds a leaf with every word he speaks. He and the tree have become spiritually bound Sinja informs him. When the tree sheds its last leaf Jack dies. Sinja promises to figure out a solution in three days but in the meantime no talking. Its a hokey setup meant to teach Jack a lesson about the power of words or something. The good news is with only a thousand words to spare Murphys dialogue is kept to a blessed minimum. Eventually youll be grateful that Jack loses a couple dozen leaves singing the Chilis babyback ribs jingle. (The restaurant chain is one of many companies that should have been billed in the cast list as supporting characters -- Starbucks cups get more screen time than Murphys son.) So no talking means less dialogue from one of the writers who penned the ""Jack and Jill"" screenplay. Awesome. The bad news? You have to spend the rest of the movie watching Murphy play charades. Of course the sensible thing to do would be to call in sick to work and feign laryngitis for three days but then there would be no movie. Instead Murphy blunders his way through a series of high-profile business meetings with big-time publishers and repeatedly tries to communicate ""With every word I speak a magic tree loses a leaf"" through an elaborate dance of jazz hands and googly eyes. Will Jack realize the error of his ways? Learn the power that words have on the world? Will he stop being such a jerk? The answers pretty obvious. The only question is how many leaves hell squander before he has his revelation -- and which words hell speak to fell those final leaves. ""A Thousand Words"" is mostly harmless but the largely joyless exercise is a letdown after getting a glimpse of a re-energized Murphy in ""Tower Heist."" Its disheartening when the highest praise you can give an Eddie Murphy performance is that at least he left his fat suit at home. Reach the reviewer at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com.

"A Thousand Words movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Let us never speak of A Thousand Words again aMarch 08 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticEddie Murphy stars in ""A Thousand Words.""The problem with Eddie Murphy? It is not a problem of talent or fearlessness. He has plenty of both. But in ""A Thousand Words"" shot back in 2008 and now available for your viewing displeasure hes a first-rate talent stuck in yet another third-rate piece of blech written by Steve Koren who shoveled us the Adam Sandler leavings ""Click"" and ""Jack and Jill"" and directed by frequent Murphy collaborator Brian Robbins whose resume includes ""Norbit"" and ""Meet Dave.""This film is squarely in the quality league of those four gems although its product placement (""This coffee is incredible"" Murphy says at one point holding up a cup that says STARBUCKS) is so galling you wait for the punch line. One that never arrives.In ""A Thousand Words"" the camera stays about two inches from Murphys hyperactive face and you start to see the strain and desperation in the actors eyes. Without saying a word those reaction shots -- the film is a 100-minute reaction shot unto itself -- says I am in trouble here yet I remain a big bad wolf of comedy. I will huff and puff and get a laugh. Somehow.Murphys character in ""A Thousand Words"" is a variation on the tetchy monster (arrogant egotistical a disinterested family man) Sandler favors in his comedies. When the high-powered literary agent Jack McCall (Murphy) pursues the publishing rights tied to a Deepak Chopra-like enlightenment guru (Cliff Curtis) and his potential bestseller the guru sees through the motormouths blather. This man he reasons needs a comeuppance. McCall receives it in the form of a suddenly sprouted Bodhi tree that sheds a leaf with every word McCall utters. When the leaves are gone McCall will die. This isnt a giving tree; its a taking tree.In the vein of ""Click"" which got into some ungodly life-affirming pathos in its protagonists redemption ""A Thousand Words"" features sequences in which McCall chases his younger self (seen in golden fields of grain) and learns to forgive the father who abandoned him and to comfort his Alzheimers-stricken mother (Ruby Dee). The films notion of successful marriage is simple Just let your wife (Kerry Washington lovely and given nothing to play) live in the cozy house she wants not the zillion-dollar Hollywood hilltop bachelor pad youd prefer.

Share Tweet One of the familiar perils of seeing a theatrical release is sitting in front of a vocal viewer who clearly cant follow whats going on. Who hasnt had an experience with someone in a theater stage-whispering ""Who is that man? Why is he so mad? Why isnt the oil well working?"" Among the minor pros of the ridiculous new Eddie Murphy vehicle A Thousand Words--now hitting theaters after four years on a studio shelf--is that it makes such questions unnecessary even for the most addled audience members. Not only does its plot proceed in a direct unambiguous line from point A to point B the film stops over and over to remind viewers where both those points are. Every emotion is loudly broadcast every development repeatedly telegraphed. Kids who cant keep up with the demanding complexities of Sesame Street will be able to follow this one. Murphy stars as a garrulous go-getter of a literary agent who clearly needs a cinematic lesson about adjusting his priorities He starts the film barking demands into his cell phone then grimacing when his wife (Kerry Washington) hands him their toddler. He fakes a phone call from a wife in labor in order to line-jump at Starbucks. He mistreats the little people in his life like his harried assistant (Clark Duke) who has to tweeze all the non-yellow-moon marshmallows out of his boss Lucky Charms. And above all he talks a blue streak In a typical bit of let-me-spell-out-the-subtext dialogue he announces to a staff meeting at his agency ""This is what I do I can talk anyone into anything"" Then after he lies to a placid guru (Cliff Curtis) while ignoring a spiritual message about the value of silence Murphy becomes magically bonded to a tree which sheds a leaf for every word he says. (Or writes or even communicates; when he flips off the tree in anger it drops two leaves to represent his ""Fuck you."") Once it loses all its leaves Curtis says it will no doubt die--and Murphy with it. In theory the resulting enforced silence leads Murphy to understand which words are truly important and absorb the value of stillness and self-examination. In practice he mostly learns that if he doesnt constantly fill the air with chatter everyone around him--including Washington Duke his boss Allison Janney Starbucks barista Jack ""Kenneth the page"" McBrayer and others--will leap to the most idiotic conclusions imaginable about what his huge gestures and silly faces are attempting to convey. A Thousand Words has its roots in any number of redemption comedies where supernatural phenomena put cartoonishly awful people through comic hell to teach them life lessons--Groundhog Day Scrooged Freaky Friday and its many offshoots--but it most strongly resembles the 1997 Jim Carrey vehicle Liar Liar in which a similar paranormal contrivance prompts some goofy sincerity after about 80 minutes of extremely broad mugging and flailing. A Thousand Words is low-tech and highbrow by modern Murphy standards--no fat suits no dual roles very little crass humor or CGI gimcrackery and a protagonist thats marginally more nuanced and less one-dimensional than in most such films. And while the ending is wretchedly fakey and predictable Murphy in subdued mode gives it a little authentic sweetness. But robbing Murphy of his voice means replacing his most potent weapon--the charismatic blue-streak babble that made his name in comedy and in films like 48 Hrs. and Beverly Hills Cop--with a single gag repeated over and over. Murphy compensates by acting extra-super-hard with his eyes bugging out and cords standing out in his neck as he attempts to make his frustration and confusion as hilarious and obvious as possible. Meanwhile director Brian Robbins (whose last two movies Norbit and Meet Dave were also Murphy vehicles) achieves the equivalent in obviousness by cutting back to leaves falling off the tree practically every time Murphy speaks in case someones forgotten. They wont have. They couldnt possibly. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Silent House Next Movie Review The Kid With A Bike Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 8 2012 1200 PM Title A Thousand Words Film Info PG-13 Language sexuality. At area theaters. The quietest times unsurprisingly are the most effective ones in ""A Thousand Words."" If only this Eddie Murphy flick had taken its own advice and spent a little more time being reflective instead of hyperactive it might have overcome a trite script and awful obvious excuses for comedy. Murphy is Jack McCall a motor-mouthed literary agent who lies smirks and exaggerates his way through life. He has a new wife (Kerry Washington) and an infant son but Jack is angry and driven so his attention isnt where it ought to be. On a trip to an ashram to sign up a spiritual leader (Cliff Curtis) Jack pricks his finger on an enlightenment-giving Bodhi tree which magically reappears in his backyard. The guru figures out that every word Jack says makes a leaf fall from the tree. When there are no leaves therell be no Jack. So he has to measure his words carefully which results in even more preening and gesturing and wild-eyed Murphy antics than usual. Obviously this is what appealed to the star and his frequent collaborator director Brian Robbins (""Norbit"" ""Meet Dave.""). Whirling Dervish Murphy resorting to goofy pantomime because the great talker is stripped of speech Ah the possibilities (Jack isnt able to write words either allowing young Clark Duke a few funny moments as Jacks assistant-turned-interpreter.) That none of Murphys frantic poses are funny is a problem but then neither were Jim Carreys forced-truth outbursts in the similar ""Liar Liar."" The real mistake in ""A Thousand Words"" - which has sat around for some three years before being released -- is that it doesnt appreciate the potential in its premise. Late in the film there is a section in which Jack finally understands that every word counts and as in ""Imagine That"" -- the sweetest of Murphys recent high-concept comedies -- theres an innocence and a nod toward the importance of inner lives. And the final words Jack chooses it must be said pay off. But one wonders what mightve happened had Murphy said one word - ""No"" -- to all the idiotic hijinks that preceded that.
