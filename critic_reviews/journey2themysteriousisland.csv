The good news is it isnt bad. Even the use of 3-D is pretty good. Hutcherson plays a self-described ""Verne-ian"" who has an admirable knowledge of and regard for classic literature although that aspect of the story is dismissed after the opening sequence. He hates having moved away from his home town and has no use for his new stepdad played by Dwayne Johnson. Johnson scores bonding points by helping him to decode a radioed message from his long-lost grandfather. Then in the quickest bit of exposition Ive ever seen the two of them fly off to the South Pacific in search of the adventurer and his mysterious island. They reach it with the help of helicopter pilot Luis Guzman and his nubile daughter Vanessa Hudgens. Soon they come upon the old adventurer himself played by a jaunty Michael Caine and learn that they are surrounded by prehistoric creatures and flying predators. Younger children may find some of the action a bit scary but the filmmakers have tried to keep this element under control--brief and just intense enough to get a rise out of their audience but never gory. The visual effects are as artificial as the genially preposterous story but the movie is all in fun and painless for grownups. (I always enjoy watching Caine at work though I suspect most kids will simply write him off as an old guy with a beard.) Journey 2 doesnt having the substance or staying power of a great Verne adaptation but if it piques even a few kids curiosity about the author I figure were ahead of the game. Not so incidentally Journey 2 is preceded by another brand-new 3-D widescreen Looney Tunes short Daffys Rhapsody. Based on the old Capitol kiddie recording featuring the great Mel Blanc with music by Billy May this energetic cartoon has Daffy rendering his rapid-fire version of Liszts ""Second Hungarian Rhapsody"" with lyrics by Warners cartoon stalwarts Warren Foster and Michael Maltese in which he bemoans his fate as a target for hunters--like Elmer Fudd (voiced here by Billy West). Director Matthew OCallaghan brings the vintage Warner Bros. characters to life with verve and vigor and makes entertaining use of 3-D. The mere sight of Daffy and Elmer on the big screen again makes me smile.

Im puzzled as usual with some of you critics. Reply Norm May 14 2016 131 am Well I welcome Daffy amp; Elmer with open arms and a huge embrace but will pass on the feature because the trailers didnt sell the film...3-D or otherwise unless everyone gets eaten and pooped out  I fail to see the excuse to make this film...If you can present an adventure that is entertaining not clumsily put together and let it work then give me a call otherwise give the money to charity...Michael Caine a long way from Harry Palmer...maybe that was a different world...

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint THE CONQUEST Director Xavier Durringers biographical drama ""The Conquest"" wowed Gallic audiences by being the first French film to satirize a sitting president -- as the opening disclaimer terms it ""a fictional film based on the lives of real people."" The politicos lampooned in the film include head of state Nicolas Sarkozy his predecessor Jacques Chirac his rival Dominique de Villepin and Sarkozys first wife and key adviser Cecilia. As a viewer vague about their policies constituencies and foibles I felt like Herman Cain facing questions about the leadership of Uzbeki-beki-beki-stanstan. The human story behind the electoral machinations is another matter and a more accessible one. ""The Conquest"" is less cynical than George Clooneys ""The Ides of March"" where the lifeblood of political campaigns flows from stabbed backs. The story follows Sarko a tough-talking law-and-order candidate on his relentless drive to a leading role on the world stage. The film portrays the center-right leader as a tireless striver who makes his way to the top by force of will competence and a canny sense of the public mood. Denis Podalydes plays ""the runt"" as detractors call him as a man of Napoleonic drive. His is a classic tale of career victories won at a great personal cost. He out-calculates his opponents seduces the media by granting access to every stroll on the beach and tirelessly woos voters. Along the way he alienates Cecilia (cool formal Florence Pernel) who was his steadfast supporter but left him for another man just as he was heading into crucial elections. The film is pitched as a satire and a few vignettes like the one in which Sarkozy bamboozles an angry factory foreman with virtuoso political double talk have comedic snap. Too often though the jaunty overeager background music seems to be underscoring jokes the action doesnt provide.  1/2 out of four stars Unrated Profanity; in subtitled French. JOURNEY 2 THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND At this point in his career Michael Caine has earned the right to do whatever he likes. So if he chooses a role trading quips with an ex-wrestler and riding the back of a giant bee who can complain? ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" is surely the silliest outing for Caine since he swatted rampaging killer bees in the 1978 disaster flick ""The Swarm."" Here he plays the adventurer grandfather of Josh Hutcherson a sulky teenage Jules Verne fanatic who is expiring of boredom in the Ohio home of his mother (""Sex and the Citys"" Kristin Davis) and too-protective stepfather (Dwayne Johnson). A radio message from the old man brings them to a South Seas isle populated by kitten-sized elephants and giant butterflies with a goofball tour guide (overactor supreme Luis Guzman) and his nubile daughter (lightly clothed Vanessa Hudgens) tagging along. The story is an agreeable scattershot affair combining notions from several of Vernes fantasy adventures with a ""Swiss Family Robinson"" formula of puppy love and family bonding. When Johnson whips out his ukulele for a campfire song or engages in a few bouts of verbal nose-twisting with the peppery Caine you can only smile. The tone is lighter than meringue the bizarre cast is engaging and the pro-literacy message is appealing. Saturday matinees were made for this.  1/2 out of four stars Rating PG for adventure action and brief mild language.

CAST Josh Hutcherson Vanessa Hudgens Dwayne Johnson LENGTH 134 ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" a 2008 kiddie version of the Jules Verne novel had its slender charms thanks to some playful visuals and the always-game Brendan Fraser as an avuncular adventurer. Neither is around in the sequel ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" which instead offers giant rocks clearly made of Styrofoam and Dwayne Johnson who fits the same description. What happened? Fraser ostensibly unavailable due to scheduling conflicts isnt the only one who apparently abandoned ship. Eric Brevig the special-effects whiz and debut director of the first film is replaced by Brad Peyton (""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"") who makes everything look like a school craft project and the new writers (Brian and Mark Gunn) have created a script thats as compelling as an appliance manual. Only Josh Hutcherson the future star of ""The Hunger Games"" returns and his brooding features and newly sculpted body (flashed for us briefly) give him the look of a young adult ready to move on. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Hutcherson plays sullen teenager Sean Anderson who reluctantly bonds with his new stepfather Hank (Johnson two biceps and one smile) when they end up stranded on a tropical Verne-like island populated by giant bees and lizards. Joining the adventure are a tight tank-top wearer named Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) and her hapless dad Gabato (Luis Guzman) a walking poop joke. Seans island-dwelling grandfather Alexander is played by Michael Caine a charmer who can uplift even execrable garbage like ""Jaws The Revenge"" but finally seems beaten by this stinker. ""Journey 2"" offers fleeting glimpses of elaborately animated creatures and the 3-D effect is put to good use during a colorful crash between two speeding birds. That may be enough to hypnotize small children for 90 minutes but everyone else will be checking their watches until exit time.

"Journey 2 Not so mysterious |       NJ.com comments Journey 2 Not so mysterious Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 10 2012 at 703 AM View/Post Comments Ron PhillipsFrom left Josh Hutcherson Luis GuzmA!n Vanessa Hudgens and Dwayne Johnson in aJourney 2 The Mysterious Island.a Hollywood executives are getting more and more efficient with their franchises Soon theyll just start off with the cheaply cashing-in sequel and skip the original movie entirely. The awkwardly titled ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" is on the face of it a follow-up to the surprise 2008 family hit ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Except it has a different director. A different star. A different actress playing one of the characters and some other new characters entirely. Its kept its young hero at least played by Josh Hutcherson -- and if you were dying for a new Josh Hutcherson movie well then youre in luck. But the rest of the film feels like a different film. A cheaper duller film. In the first movie Brendan Fraser (who declined to return when the studio didnt rehire the first director) and his on-screen nephew explored a subterranean world and discovered that Jules Vernes classic science-fiction tales werent fiction at all. In this film Frasers nowhere to be found and Hutcherson is a confused young man (perhaps because his mom is now played by a different actress). And so as a bonding experience stepdad Dwayne Johnson takes him on a trip in search of Vernes mysterious island. And -- big spoiler here -- they find it. They also find comic relief in the comical shape of Luis Guzman and a teen love interest in the teensy shape of Vanessa Hudgens. Also Hutchersons long-lost grandfather played by a chummy (if rather alarmingly short of breath) Michael Caine. Caine is wonderful of course and Johnson has a great smile but casting him seems like a mistake from the start. If you want to really get some drama out of giant beasts chasing your characters it helps if your hero isnt a giant beast too. And the effects are less than awe-inspiring. Although theres one good enormous lizard the feathered fiends look like refugees from Angry Birds. And I swear some of the giant Day-Glo vegetation had ""Property of Lost in Space "" stamped on it. It seems churlish to lambaste anything that might actually send young readers back to the classics and the way the characters toss around names like ""Captain Nemo"" and brandish beautiful 19th-century hardcovers has a certain charm. Far less charming is the reliance on goo and poo jokes a slightly pervy fascination with Hudgens crawling around in short-shorts and a score that seems less like an homage to John Williams ""Jurassic Park"" work than a wicked parody that had the jokes removed. And several minutes of Johnson singing and playing the ukulele -- while meant perhaps as a tribute to Kirk Douglas similar vocalizing in ""20000 Leagues Under the Sea"" -- serves no purpose other than to provide a bathroom break for the kiddies. But please give them a real break. Dont take them to this mess which -- adding insult to injury -- begins with a ""new"" Daffy Duck cartoon. Which not only turns Elmer Fudd into a senseless maniac but -- thanks to computer animation -- leaves these two old friends looking like a pair of cheap rubbery toys. And tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that stinks folks. Ratings note The film contains bathroom humor and violence. Journey 2 The Mysterious Island (PG) Warners (94 min.) Directed by Brad Peyton.

By    Alonso Duralde on February 8 2012  434 pm Follow aduralde Email Print Theres nothing to hate about 3D family adventure ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" starring Dwayne Johnson -- but not all that much to like either Apparently I saw 2008s ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" but remembering anything about it required digging out my old review in which I noted ""an afternoon spent enjoying jumbo sodas and the 3-D effects of Journey to the Center of the Earth isnt the worst way to kill a few hours. Just think of it more as an E-Ticket attraction and less as an actual movie."" Innocuous time-killing remains the agenda of the sequel ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" a movie that proves that you can build an entire franchise out of not sucking. These movies are the equivalent of those pre-made sandwiches you buy at Starbucks -- not bad for you and not entirely lacking in flavor but nothing particularly memorable either. Josh Hutcherson returns as Sean Anderson who in the first movie -- and again it was only in reading my review that I remember any of this -- found a kingdom far beneath the earths surface by treating Jules Vernes novel ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" as a factual guidebook. This time around Sean intercepts a radio message that he believes came from his grandfather Alexander (Michael Caine) whos spent the last two years trying to find Vernes legendary ""Mysterious Island."" In the hopes that their trek will be a bonding experience Seans stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson) volunteers to accompany the teenager to Palau where they hire tour guide Gabato (Luis Guzman) and his daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) to take them to the coordinates even though locals know the area as a place where ships go to disappear. Their helicopter like the boat in Vernes novel goes into a hurricane and emerges in a hidden and wondrous land where elephants are as small as puppies and birds and bumblebees are the size of late-model sedans. Director Brad Peyton (""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"") galumphs through the material with a reasonable degree of competence with the requisite chase scenes and precipice-dangling thrown in every few minutes. The special effects vary wildly however with their flaws made manifest even more vividly in 3-D -- the giant angry lizard for instance has the tangible realness of the great movie monsters but the crash of the helicopter looks distractingly fake. Where Peyton really bobbles is in the handling of his actors; Hutchersons angry abandoned teen was the original films one element that felt fresh and real but here he comes off as generically arrogant. Johnsons performance comes with a self-satisfaction level that indicates he hasnt gotten pro wrestling entirely out of his system and whats supposed to be a comic rivalry with Caine feels uncomfortably like mutual disdain because of the awkwardness of their interplay. (Still they say the biggest part of acting is listening and Caine deserves points for having to listen to Johnson sing ""What a Wonderful World"" on the ukulele.) The usually reliable Guzman tries to inject some life into his corny dialogue (not that he makes the slightest effort to sound less like a Mexican-American and more like a Pacific Islander) and Hudgens gets saddled with a thankless role that gives her nothing to play. ""Bandslam"" proved that shes got a wickedly deadpan sense of humor when the dialogue allows it but here shes just the headstrong girl whos destined to fall in the love with the hero strictly because the screenplay says so. Still the movie zips by inoffensively and heaven knows there arent enough kids movies that tacitly encourage reading classic literature so families could certainly do worse than to sign on for this ""Journey."" (Screening with ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" is a new 3-D animated short ""Daffys Rhapsody"" and while its better than the disconcerting ""I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat"" cartoon that was attached to ""Happy Feet Two"" its yet another piece that assumes that Looney Tunes fans really wanted to see realistically-rendered feathers and 3-D spittle. Youre better off sticking with Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd in their original 2-D versions.) Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Luis Guzman Vanessa Hudgens Michael Caine Dwayne Johnson and Josh Hutcherson in a scene from ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island.""(Ron Phillips/AP Photo/Warner Bros.) Movie review Mysterious Island Action-packed and adolescent Add to ... STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 10 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Newfoundlanders like seditious stunts. Think of 22 Minutess Marg Delahunty laying a mile-wide lipstick skid on Stephen Harper in 2004 and just last year sending Toronto mayor Rob Ford beetling up his driveway to call 911. Now we have Gander-born Ryerson film grad Brad Peytons Journey 2 The Mysterious Island a Hollywood 3-D family adventure with a steady supply of nervy send-ups. YouTube frame grab from Mysterious Island trailer. Movies Journey 2 The Mysterious Island The official Trailer For instance buzzing Michael Caine mean old Arry Brown about a lost tropical island on a giant bumble bee. Or having beefcake star Dwayne Johnson flex his pectorals at incoming chokeberries sending 3-D major league fastballs whizzing at our heads. The Mysterious Island updates Jules Vernes 1874 novel. Ohio teenager Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and his stepdad (Johnson) break a mysterious code and travel to the Pacific in search of an absent grandfather (Caine) and lost paradise. Forget about mom school and work - adventure awaits. Off they go ferried to Shangri-la by a nincompoop helicopter driver (Luis Guzman) and his beautiful daughter (Vanessa Hudgens). Spiralling through a hurricane funnel our adventurers land on an upside-down Galapagos. Everything thats supposed to be big is small including dwarf elephants you can pick up and cuddle. Ahhh. And what should be small is ... look out Surfboard centipedes T-Rex lizards and swooping angry aircraft finches. Making matters worse albeit more cinematic the local volcano is spewing a gold spreading fire. The island is also sinking. Where did Jules Verne say he put the bloody submarine? And so our four heroes rush about dodging disaster uttering breathless comic-book dialogue ""What in blue heck is that?"" ""The tectonic plates have started to pull apart under the island"" Yes The Mysterious Island is everything a 12-year-old boy could want - endless adventure involving a reckless adolescent hero with a pretty girl in a clinging T-shirt around to watch him struggle. Director Peytons curious handling of the material will interest adults too. In his underappreciated animated CBC series What Its Like Being Alone (2006) Peyton demonstrated a tender twisted sympathy for lost children. Set in a very peculiar orphanage the show had unmistakable Addams Family values. Peytons off-kilter humour is on display here too. The film regularly teases its adult stars. For instance the scene with Johnson swatting berries with his twitching chest. Nor is Peytons Mysterious Island CGI tableau what you might expect. While striking the sets are clearly unreal; the animals sometimes glaringly mechanical. Forget about Avatar. Peyton is clearly smitten with stop-motion animation done in the 1950s and 60s specifically the fabulously fake work of producer Ray Harryhausen who himself created a 1961 film adaptation of Vernes Mysterious Island. Harryhausen was often indifferent to performances. That too could be Peytons Achilles heel. Luis Guzmans scaredy-cat pilot can be rationalized as more adult bashing. But for satire to work it has to make us laugh. And what Guzman does here is punishingly unfunny - 90 minutes of ghastly owl-eyed scene stealing. Oh that he could put all those scenes back where they belong. Still Mysterious Island is an improvement on Peytons last film the excessively frantic Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore. The Newfoundland filmmaker has the potential to become a major comic director. If only he could make a movie from one of his own stories. If not hell have to perform the auteurs trick of making someone elses script his own.

Photo (c)Warner Bros/courtesy Everett Co Dwayne ""The Rock Johnson stereoscopically flexing his pectorals is the most impressive special effect in this sequel to ""Journey to the Center of the Earth which helped kick off the 3-D boom in 2008. The first film starring Brendan Fraser had far better effects and a lot of fun with the clever idea of a contemporary father and son following clues in Jules Vernes book to re-create his adventures. Fraser is conspicuously absent from this cash-grabbing sequel which brings back only the actor who played his son (a bored-looking Josh Hutcherson). It introduces the ever-charming Mr. Johnson as Hutchersons stepdad. Kristin Davis who looks like shed rather be having her legs waxed cameos briefly as his wife. PHOTOS JOSH HUTCHERSON AND MORE FUTURE STARS You know were in serious trouble when even old pros such as Michael Caine and Luis Guzman cant do anything with the uninspired and unfunny script. Its been patched together from bits and pieces of Vernes ""Mysterious Island and ""20000 Leagues Under the Sea Robert Louis Stevensons ""Treasure Island and Jonathan Swifts ""Gullivers Travels. Swift would probably satirically skewer the idea of a retired Navy SEAL and his stepson traveling to the South Pacific to find the boys long-lost grandfather (Caine). The last leg of their journey is aboard a ramshackle helicopter with Guzman and his daughter (Vanessa Hudgens) -- whom Johnson suggests his son can woo by flexing his pectorals. They all crash-land on an island that turns out to be sinking -- but nowhere near as fast as the movie. With cheesy-looking effects including a ride on the backs of giant bees and dubious literary references ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island comes dangerously close to giving books never mind 3-D a bad name. But theres actually a pretty decent reason to see this movie. It will be preceded in theaters by ""Daffys Rhapsody a brilliant new animated short in 3-D with Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd. Referencing practically the entire Golden Age of Warner Bros. cartoons it turns a Mel Blanc recording for a 1950 childrens record into several minutes of sheer hilarity and joy.

Starring Dwayne Johnson Michael Caine Josh Hutcherson Vanessa Hudgens Kristin Davis Luis Guzman Director Brad Peyton Running time 134 Release Opened Feb 10 2012  Editorial Review More of a mess than a mysteryBy John DeForeFriday Feb. 10 2012Managing to make classic 19th-century adventure yarns feel as wondrous and exotic as a Hallmark Channel special ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" sincerely tries to pay homage to the likes of Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson but is too contaminated by todays tame sensibilities to make it fly. The sequel to 2008s ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" suffers first from an exposition that is cloddish even by the standards of multiplex kid stuff. Cramming a tangled mess of motivations into a few minutes it barely attempts to make us believe that Hank (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) would take his hateful stepson Sean (Josh Hutcherson) on a spur-of-the-moment trip to the South Pacific just because a mysterious radio transmission has hinted that Vernes ""Mysterious Island"" actually exists and Seans grandpa (Michael Caine) is adventuring there. Faster than you can say ""can we license this for a Happy Meal?"" the two have arrived in Palau and hired sketchy helicopter pilot Gabato (Luis Guzman) to take them to the islands coordinates. Gabato comes with teenage daughter Kailani - cue the slow-mo removal of sunglasses to indicate Seans PG-rated leering. Kailani played by Vanessa Hudgens of the ""High School Musical"" films almost benefits from the lack of interest screenwriters Brian and Mark Gunn show in her While the Gunns plant juvenile witticisms in her co-stars mouths and force them to move the plot along with factual tidbits they have no way of knowing (""the sea levels risen 100 feet in the last 24 hours"") Hudgens can just pretend shes a normal teen shipwrecked on this strange island. Strange island indeed. The first thing we learn about the place is that proportions are inverted Life forms that are giant in our world are tiny in this one and vice versa. But the rule applies only when the filmmakers are thinking about it. Fireflies are still tiny here; trees are still big - and if our heroes wrangle giant bumblebees to fly them around those bees will be much smaller than the birds who attack them regardless of logic that would have made the birds minor pests. The movies flexibility with its own rules would be less noticeable if it were busy thrilling us. But the action here consists exclusively of barely reheated sequences from better films and the dialogues allusions to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" serve only to remind us what were missing and to remind us indirectly that where that film turned little-known character actors into near-icons this one takes the reliably great Luis Guzman and forces him to cower and whine as if he were auditioning for the ""Three Stooges"" remake. (Caine in his own way fares no better.) While Johnson displays little of the self-aware humor that has sometimes elevated his lowbrow outings he does remain guilelessly committed to this sinking ship earnestly selling its absent-father themes and flexing his pecs while waiting for director Brad Peyton to figure out what hes doing. Presumably those pecs are still flexing.Contains light action and mild language.

Journey 2 (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Journey 2 (PG) A genuinely fun family adventure that channels the spirit of Jules Verne. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald2/9/2012 Editor rating 2.5 The second installment in a likable family franchise Journey 2 The Mysterious Island makes a nice case to your kids that reading books is a good idea. Based oh-so-loosely on Jules Vernes classic the film follows the further adventures of teenager Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) who -- speaking of Verne classics -- journeyed to the center of the earth with his uncle (Brendan Fraser) back in 2008. Fortunately Sean has other adventurous relatives In Mysterious Island he intercepts a radio signal from his missing grandfather (a jovial Michael Caine) who is off somewhere in the South Pacific looking for Vernes island. Hardcore Vernians you see believe the island really exists. This movie may be for kids but its got enough meta moments to delight adults who appreciate that sort of thing. Sean wants to rush off to Palau to search for the old man but his mom (Kristin Davis) and her boyfriend Hank (Dwayne Johnson) object (though strangely not because the price of a round-trip plane ticket to a small Pacific island is prohibitive). A deal is struck Hank and Sean will go together. Sulky Sean is not really happy about this agreement but cheers up considerably once they book a helicopter to take them to the coordinates Grandpa sent and he gets a look at the lovely daughter (Vanessa Hudgens) of the cowardly pilot (Luis Guzman). A bizarre storm deposits them all on the island and the adventure begins. The scares in Mysterious Island are mild enough The helicopter crash isnt at all frightening and an encounter with an angry giant lizard provides an extremely funny face-off with Johnson who is a genuinely engaging screen personality. Guzman provides goofy sidekick humor involving bird poop and exaggerated terror and Hudgens offers a bit of tough-girl femininity amid all the testosterone. Most interesting of all is Hutcherson (The Kids Are All Right) whos poised on the brink of Robert Pattinson-like superstardom come March when The Hunger Games hits theaters. Hes a solid screen presence as the resourceful Sean a skill that should serve him well as Games heartthrob Peeta. The films logic is cheerfully carelessly faulty and the leaps of understanding as unlikely as the existence of a habitat that produces tiny elephants and monstrous spiders . The whimsy -- the characters ride plus-size bees for heavens sake -- will try the patience of teenagers who prefer menace and violence with their action. The Mysterious Island is aimed at younger kids and parents who cant face the notion of sitting through the 3D reboot of The Phantom Menace this weekend. But then again neither Sean nor Hank can find the island or rescue the group without having read Vernes books and such a salute to the power of imagination and the importance of reading deserves praise. Besides lets be honest -- who wouldnt like to ride a giant bee? Cast Dwayne Johnson Josh Hutcherson Michael Caine Luis Guzman Vanessa Hudgens. Director Brad Peyton. Screenwriters Brian Gunn Mark Gunn Richard Outten. Based on the book by Jules Verne. Producers Beau Flynn Charlotte Huggins Tripp Vinson. A New Line Cinema/Warner Bros. release. Running time 94 minutes. Some action adventure mild brief language. Opens Friday Feb. 10 at area theaters.

PremiereMORE The Rock sings flexes pecs charms pressOstensibly a sequel to 2008s Journey to the Center of the Earth it has a similar amusement-park-ride quality and follows the exploits of Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson reprising his role). Now 17 Sean is sullenly coping with new stepfather Hank (Johnson) who only recently wed his mom (Kristin Davis). Hank is doing his level best but is failing to connect with the teen. Sean whose father died is initially resistant but warms up to Hank when they crack a coded distress signal.About the movieJourney 2 The Mysterious Island  1/2 out of fourStars Dwayne Johnson Michael Caine Josh Hutcherson Kristin Davis Vanessa Hudgens Luis Guzman DirectorBrad PeytonDistributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for some mild adventure action and brief mild language Running time 1 hour 34 minutes Opens Friday nationwideSean deciphers the island coordinates with the help of Hank a former Navy code-breaker. They fly to the South Pacific in search of Vernes Mysterious Island and from there are perilously ferried by helicopter pilot Gabato (Guzman) and his daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens). They fly into a storm and crash-land on an island that puts Xanadu Shangri-La and most of Disneyland to shame. Its a spectacular place with a gold-spewing volcano tiny elephants and iridescent butterflies the size of eagles.The islands lone human inhabitant is Seans peripatetic grandfather Alexander (Caine) who sent his grandson the message to draw him there.Dueling adventurers Hank and Alexander lock horns. The films few funny lines are bandied amusingly between Johnson and Caine. Hearing Hank call Alexander ""Mary Poppins"" and Alexander refer to Hank as ""Sasquatch"" is more entertaining -- at least for anyone over 10 -- than the rather lackluster aerial chases with the cast riding giant furry bees.The quintet must find a way off the island which the seemingly all-knowing Hank figures out is sinking fast. Its a thoroughly family-friendly film with a subtle message about the importance of father figures. Dont expect anything resembling believability but enjoy the blend of strikingly colorful visuals and banter between odd couple Johnson and Caine which combine for a mild escapist treat.

Starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Josh Hutcherson. Directed by Brad Peyton. (PG. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson can do no wrong. Even if he could do wrong I wouldnt say so because he might come after me and crush me with his chin. Or - even scarier - his pecs a force of nature played for sustained and bizarre comic effect in ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" a brainless 3-D sequel to 2008s brainless 3-D ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Johnson plays Hank stepdad to Sean (Josh Hutcherson) last seen gamboling around the Earths core in the first ""Journey."" When Sean picks up a coded radio transmission he immediately assumes its from Gramps ( Michael Caine) indicating the location of the island and Hank immediately takes Sean there for an impromptu if wildly expensive bonding experience. After stopping by Palau to hire an idiot helicopter pilot (Luis Guzman) and his take-charge teenage daughter (Vanessa Hudgens) the four get sucked into high winds and crash on the landform of mystery. For a time ""Journey 2"" becomes a lost episode of ""Lost"" then it becomes ""King Kong"" minus the ape. Then it becomes a ukulele music video featuring the Rocks take on Israel Kamakawiwooles ""What a Wonderful World."" The movie manages these transformations with eye-singeing computer effects and genially stupid who-gives-a-crap dialogue that hits a low point of imagination or maybe a high point of succinctness with a Rock-issued plea to ""Run run run run run run run"" This is the sort of harmless merriment that filmgoers have come to expect from a certain brand of big-budget family entertainment but you know what would have been nice too? A script. ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" was written by cousins Brian and Mark Gunn and directed by Brad Peyton best known for ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" which wasnt as bad as you think. It arrives in theaters with a Warner Bros. short ""Daffys Rhapsody"" following Elmer Fudd on a jaunt to the opera. Its cute. Its brief. And Daffy can do no wrong.

Credit Ron Phillips/Warner Brothers Pictures Like cars that are involved in crashes islands explode far more often in the movies than they do in real life. Another one goes kablooey in ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" a sequel to the 2008 film ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" that again gives a Jules Verne tale 3-D treatment.Sean (Josh Hutcherson) the only major returnee from the earlier movie receives a radio transmission that leads him to believe that his grandfather is on a fantastical island in the middle of nowhere and he and his stepfather (Dwayne Johnson) go looking for it.The usual escape-before-the-big-blast stuff ensues augmented by some fairly tedious family dynamics. But this kind of movie is all about the special effects. They start out great -- cool helicopter crash very convincing giant lizard -- but grow more amateurish as the film goes along with a flight sequence on giant bees proving particularly clunky.Michael Caine plays the grandfather and the efforts at repartee between his character and Mr. Johnsons occasionally amuse. Vanessa Hudgens from the ""High School Musical"" movies is on hand too though its Mr. Johnson who gets to sing. Besides that musical moment the movie makes no effort to do anything other than what is expected and it succeeds at that.""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Angry animals and an angrier landscape.

But when the safe house is attacked he finds himself on the run with his charge. Video courtesy of NBC Universal. By John Anderson February 10 2012 ""Do I make you nervous?"" asks renegade CIA agent Tobin Frost eyeballing the equally treacherous British operative sitting beside him in Cape Town South Africa traffic. ""Always"" replies the Brit as a snipers bullet ventilates his skull. Clearly theres something dangerous about hanging out with Tobin Frost. The same can be said of Denzel Washington who brings his cobra smile and a surfeit of charisma to Swedish director Daniel Espinosas often frenetic action thriller ""Safe House."" Co-starring the ubiquitous Ryan Reynolds the film works well or not according to who is on screen As Tobins outmatched opponent CIA ""housekeeper"" Matt Weston (he maintains the agencys safe house in Cape Town) Mr. Reynolds brings an appropriate degree of naivete and boyishness to a film thats largely about loss of innocence. But whether hes right for the role or not is irrelevant What we want to watch is Mr. Washington and of him there is not nearly enough. ENLARGE Denzel Washington in Safe House. Universal Studios Its curious given Mr. Espinosas often furious style and indulgence in artistic mayhem how much of ""Safe House"" neatly fits into predetermined slots. As Hollywoods go-to callow youth Mr. Reynolds is a casting directors no-brainer Matt is angling for a post in Paris where he would be much nearer his girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder) and could get his stalled career in gear. Ideology? Absent. Similarly by the book is the casting of his three superiors Sam Shepard shows up these days whenever anyone needs a gray eminence; Brendan Gleeson is a slippery character something a spy movie certainly needs; and Vera Farmiga is filmdoms ripe actress of the moment with the looks intelligence and just enough years to make her plausible as a high-ranking CIA officer. The wild card is Mr. Washington. Even though hes too attractive and engaging to be a natural villain you cant say he doesnt try He won an Oscar for playing the bad guy in ""Training Day."" He was charmingly sinister in ""American Gangster."" He even went out of his way to be unlikable in ""Unstoppable."" In ""Safe House"" hes a near-mythical rogue agent who has sold out the CIA time and again to the highest bidder. Spoken about in hushed tones he seems to be Langleys version of Voldemort although when he appears in Cape Town clad in a wide-brimmed hat and sweeping black coat--a cloak-and-dagger affectation thats both marvelous and marvelously overdone--his intentions are unclear. He is shown injecting something into his side which later turns out to be a tiny capsule containing information valuable enough that every mercenary and Mossad agent in town is after him. The heat becomes so intense that Tobin turns himself in to the U.S. embassy. Better that than sure death on the street. Perhaps hell be handed over to someone inept enough to let him get away? Enter Matt who cant understand why he hasnt been given bigger things to do. (Its clear enough to us.) A band of CIA agents arrives at the safe house and immediately subjects Tobin to water torture. ""Is this legal?"" Matt asks worriedly--a line which in terms of character development and economy is near perfect absolving him from adult responsibility and affirming the agencys good judgment. When the CIA officers are swiftly blown away by an invading army of opposing agents Matt is left holding the bag i.e. Tobin and we brace ourselves for a mismatch. The fact is were already in one. ""Safe House"" is a sturdy enough thriller but one that consistently defaults to the less interesting of its two lead characters. The ads for the movie imply that Tobin is some kind of Hannibal Lecter and Matt his Clarisse but theres only a hint of that. Much more time is devoted to Matt keeping Tobin in check or chasing after him once he flees taking Mr. Espinosas better instincts with him The psychological nuance of ""Safe House"" which seemed so promising gets subsumed by action which is ambitious but less bracing than what Mr. Washington seemed to be cooking up behind that smile. Set in 1999 Los Angeles veteran police officer Dave Brown the last of the renegade cops works to take care of his family and struggles for his own survival. Video courtesy of Millennium Entertainment. Rampart ""Im not a racist"" says Dave Brown. ""I hate all people equally."" You believe half of what he says and as inhabited by Woody Harrelson all of what he is A misanthropic street cop in 1999 Los Angeles who is smoking drinking and not-eating himself to death brutalizing suspects and thanks to others just like him watching the sun set on his special brand of community policing. ENLARGE Woody Harrelson in Rampart. Millenium Entertainment They say westerns are out but writer-director Oren Moverman has made one in the tradition of ""Shane"" ""The Gunfighter"" and ""Lonely Are the Brave"" stories about men who see the writing on the wall but refuse to heed it. With Mr. Harrelson Mr. Moverman has created an antihero of epic proportions and indiscretions. Nicknamed ""Date Rape"" for having avoided prosecution for the murder of a serial rapist Dave lives next door to his two ex-wives who happen to be sisters (Cynthia Nixon Anne Heche) and whose daughters are both sisters and cousins (Brie Larson Sammy Boyarsky). Having failed the bar exam for an unspecified but probably perverse reason Dave can thrust and parry with any bureaucrat the city throws at him (Sigourney Weaver Steve Buscemi). They cant touch him. To get Dave theyd have to capture him on video beating a black motorist with a blackjack. Which is precisely what happens. The grossly underrated Mr. Harrelson looks menacingly gaunt throughout and recaptures the intensity he brought to Mr. Movermans ""The Messenger."" Framing Dave against the azure Los Angeles sky or a taco joint the Israeli-born director puts a fresh spin on Old West-style rugged individualism and it isnt pretty. But like Daves blackjack it earns our attention. Journey 2 The Mysterious Island Sean Anderson partners with his moms boyfriend on a mission to find his grandfather who is thought to be missing on a mythical island. Video courtesy of Warner Bros. A mash-up of Jules Verne Jonathan Swift Robert Louis Stevenson and the Lost Continent of Atlantis ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" is the kind of movie in which the teenage boy is disgruntled the teenage girl wears a tank top the island locale rings with reggae music regardless of its proximity to Jamaica and any action sequence is rendered in painfully deliberate slo-mo. And its all in 3-D of course even if the effects get shoehorned into the narrative In one sequence Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has to toss tropical berries at the chest of stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson) whose overdeveloped pecs propel those berries through the fourth wall. Its simply delicious. As the lad pursues the plucky Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) and her father (Luiz Guzman) dithers shamelessly Sean and Hank are escorted by Seans grandfather (Michael Caine who it seems never turns down a role) across the fabled Atlantis where sharks are the size of goldfish and our heroes ride bareback on bumblebees. Its not as magical as it sounds. Far more enchanting is ""Daffys Rhapsody"" the new Daffy Duck-Elmer Fudd cartoon playing before ""Journey 2."" Reminiscent of the classic ""Whats Opera Doc?"" it features Daffy in a one-duck show about his life which he sings (to Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody) as Elmer tries to shoot him. Its a neat marriage of old and new The technology is 3-D; the voice is that man of a thousand voices Mel Blanc who died in 1989 but recorded this in the 1950s. In Darkness A dramatization of one mans rescue of Jewish refugees in the Nazi-occupied Polish city of Lvov. Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. In her gripping Holocaust drama ""In Darkness"" celebrated Polish director Agnieszka Holland portrays a world in which the Nazis exist outside of any moral equation. Their acts of cruelty are routine their souls irredeemable their existence irrelevant to a story involving questions of human emotion. The point is that ""In Darkness"" a fact-based story about Jews hiding underground in occupied Poland is not a film about good and evil. Its about good and good--which like Ms. Hollands occasional shot of a Jewish child playing with a rat in a sewer can be more horrifying than a bomb blowing up a building. In 1943 Lvov as the Nazi crackdown begins Leopold (Robert Wieckiewicz) a sewer worker who routinely robs houses vacated by the dead and deported agrees to hide a group of Jews but only because they can pay him. Wanda (Kinga Preis) Leopolds wife and a devout Catholic refuses to go along with her neighbors opportunistic anti-Semiticism. Leopold therefore must keep his profitmaking even from her as he tries to keep himself and ""his Jews"" from being discovered and executed. ENLARGE Krzysztof Skonieczny and Robert Wieckiewicz in In Darkness. Sony Pictures Classics The film has an almost relentless dramatic tension something intensified by Jolanta Dylewskas cinematography which gives a greasy texture to the sewer and the increasingly sallow flesh of its inhabitants. What makes this nominee for the best-foreign-film Oscar singular among Holocaust movies is the way it characterizes the banality of life underground People may be hip-deep in water and peril but theyre still practicing all their surface vices--bickering battling having adulterous sex taking drugs practicing snobbery even as the jackboots echo overhead. There are several set pieces that are remarkable technically and cinematically but what lingers after the lights come on is a kind of brutal beauty very sad and very human. --Mr. Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD Focus ENLARGE Training Day (2001) Denzel Washington won his second Oscar (the first was for ""Glory"") for playing a thoroughly corrupt cop in this Antoine Fuqua-directed suspense thriller. One could argue Mr. Washington was really the supporting player to Ethan Hawke Its Hawkes Jake Hoyt after all who develops and changes as hes introduced to the realities of street policing by Mr. Washingtons Alonzo Harris who remains throughout the film one profoundly bad dude. The role made Mr. Washington the first African-American Best Actor Oscar winner in almost 40 years Sidney Poitier having received the award for ""Lilies of the Field"" in 1963. L.A. Confidential (1997) The LAPD of director Curtis Hansons daylighted noir (with spectacularly subtle cinematography by Dante Spinotti) is a big big barrel of bad apples in this adaptation of the James Ellroy novel scripted by Mr. Hanson and Brian Helgeland (""Mystic River""). Its a movie in which everything seems to coalesce including the careers of its three principals--Russell Crowe Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey--each of whom plays a cop confronting his own brand of corruption. The only performer in the film to get an Oscar though was Kim Basinger for playing Veronica Lake-lookalike Lynn Bracken. The Departed (2006) The Academy Award winner for Best Picture of 2006 Martin Scorseses Irish mob movie earned an Academy nomination for Mark Wahlberg who portrayed a rotten human being. The rotten cop on the other hand was played by Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan who infiltrates the Massachusetts State Police at the same time good guy Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) is infiltrating Bostons top gang of cutthroats. Said cutthroats are headed up by a particularly evil Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello who was modeled after noted Beantown bad guy Whitey Bulger who at the time was sunning himself in Santa Monica. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

But the muscles that matter most to Johnson the actor as opposed to the former pro wrestler are the zygomaticus major which control the smile. They are as buff and ready for action as his chest and arms an emblem of easy charm. He uses the quick smile on his future stepson Sean (Josh Hutcherson returning to this Jules Verne-goes-21st-century franchise which began with 2008s Journey to the Center of the Earth) but to no avail. The boy dislikes Hank even though he seems to make mom (Kirstin Davis) happy and is kind and decent. The movies largest emotional concern is creating a bond between the recalcitrant Verne-obsessed teen and the man obsessed with being a good father figure to Sean. Hanks motivation comes from his own bad dad experience; his father ""left when I was eight and I havent seen him since."" (Vote in TIMEs Oscar Competition Our Hunt for the BEST Best Picture) Dont worry; their emotional journey is a piece of cake as is every easily earned triumph in this lightweight adventure tale. The story opens with Sean puzzling over a coded radio signal he believes is a message from his missing grandfather. (The family has a tendency to wander; Dad was missing in the first Journey which starred another muscle man Brendan Fraser.) Hank who has a Navy background cracks the code far faster than most parents decipher the grading system on an elementary school report card. The radio communique contains an announcement to quicken the heart of any Vernian; the writers allegedly fictional island from his 1874 novel The Mysterious Island is in fact real and located in the South Pacific. Come visit If ill-mannered Sean were my future stepson I doubt very much Id want to take him halfway across the world and particularly not to an uncharted isle where we could potentially get stuck together for all time but thats just what Hank does. Mom stays behind (Davis has maybe four minutes of screen time all of it smiling benevolently) but two other travelers join them a hapless helicopter pilot (Luiz Guzman) and his daughter (Vanessa Hudgens). Another quibble - if Id traveled all that way to see a hidden tropical treasure where butterflies are the size of condors and elephants the size of cocker spaniels Id plan to linger and smell the hibiscus or at least let red-faced immature Grandpa (Michael Caine) cook me a nice plate of scrambled lizard eggs. But not Hank; hed like to keep the visit as short as a pit stop on the New Jersey Turnpike. Danger in the form of giant lizards and bad jokes await them as well as a clumsy mishmash of classic literature references - not just Verne - meant to make the audience feel erudite while explaining the complexities of the island. Its Jonathan Swifts Lilliput or Robert Louis Stevensons Treasure Island or Atlantis or maybe all three at once. (I was disappointed that Sean Hank and their companions -- who provide comic and comely relief -- didnt spend a few nights at CliffsNotes Cottage.) All this is just an excuse for action sequences broadly influenced by the Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean movies but nowhere near as technologically lively even in 3-D. The crumbling caverns and skeletons all look as fake as the drooling volcano towering over the center of the island. But as cartoonish as those giant lizards spiders and hungry angry birds appear parents are advised to take that PG rating seriously. A child near me at an advance screening hid his face in his chair during every chase sequence and bellowed ""this is not a movie to take kids to"" (Okay he was sitting right next to me. And on our car ride home he voiced the opinion that PG should be for kids 9 and up.) Certainly its not for very small kids. Its silly enough that young teens are unlikely to be drawn to it unless theyve got a thing for Hudgens or want to take an early peek at Hutcherson who will soon be seen as Peeta in The Hunger Games. He was great as a sulky brat in The Kids Are All Right but in Journey 2 he comes across as wooden dull and though not yet 20 too old for roles like these. So an awful lot is riding on Johnsons zygomaticus major. Theyre powerful but they cant work miracles.

I searched and searched ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island for something to like. There isnt much an enormous electric eel that powers a sunken ship Dwayne Johnson sitting on a log next to Michael Caine while strumming a ukulele and breaking into song the closing credits. Even by the unambitious standards of some childrens movies and many movies that star Caine this one has a difficult time making a case for itself as anything other than an adventure in baby-sitting.Ye Olde Sullen Teen (Josh Hutcherson) and the stepfather (Johnson) he loathes wind up in the South Pacific looking for his estranged archeologist grandfather (Caine). All the eye-rolling culminates in a sort of group hug after an opportunistic islander (Luis Guzman) and his tough daughter (Vanessa Hudgens) join them on this computer-generated obstacle course. The teen has the hots for the daughter but not as badly as the filmmakers who cant pass up an opportunity to watch Hudgens from behind as she wiggles out of a cave or leans over in a wet tank top. If this movie were aiming to turn her into Raquel Welch or Denise Richards it would have to let Hudgens in on the joke but the movie doesnt have any jokes. Its leering.""The Mysterious Island claims to be based on the 138-year-old Jules Verne book of the same name. But precious little of the novel has survived the torture of adaptation. Verne was seeing the future. He was innovating. He was comical suspenseful and fun. If anything ""Journey 2 - ""Journey to the Center of the Earth was a hit with Hutcherson and Brendan Fraser in 2008 - is meta-Verne with token references to the author his other books and his forebears. It owes far more to video games and the flavorless directives of so-called family films in which anything potentially fascinating and frightful about I dont know a mysterious island is made perfectly bland. Curiosity and wonder are insulted as every minute on the island which is sinking is spent trying to escape it.Johnson is perfectly fine in a movie like this. Kids find his muscles and facial expressions entertaining. But docility is not his strong suit as a star - gentleness yes. The movie requires nothing more of him than to be a tree-trunk in a damp T-shirt. He has that lovely moment with Caine on a log. And Caine really seems to connect with kids. When he demands applause the theater I was in filled with clapping. He and Johnson have a rapport too. The older man appears to be saying to the younger one ""Ive worked with this studio before. Their checks clear. Besides look over there. We dont even have the worst role.Hes right. Guzman wearily bears the responsibility for comic relief. He has no chemistry with anyone least of all with Hudgens who is very sweet with Hutcherson and very awkward with Guzman. Her awkwardness might be the understandable result of embarrassment. Every couple of minutes Guzman has to say run from a digital lizard and deliver a line like ""I hope she doesnt like food with poop in its pants. He might as well be speaking for the studio which is hoping we do.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

Luis Guzman Vanessa Hudgens Josh Hutcherson Dwayne Johnson and Michael Caine (Ron Phillips) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday February 9 2012 1129 AM Title Journey 2 The Mysterious Island Film Info PG Comic peril. At area theaters. If theres a book-loving adventuress or adventurer in your house younger than 10 ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" provides a lighthearted break from the death-obsessed ""Harry Potter"" franchise and other literary but limp adventures like the ""Narnia"" films and ""The Lightning Thief."" ""Journey 2"" in fact harkens back to so-bad-theyre-fun 70s childrens epics like ""At the Earths Core"" and ""The Land That Time Forgot."" So adults should take a star away from the three given here but be comfortable knowing that young moviegoers will come out of this Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson family film with at best a curiosity about the classics and at worst a who-cares feeling about Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd. (The sputtering fowl and spittling hunter are in a new Looney Toons short before the movie a frantic frolic on a Broadway stage.) Johnson plays Hank stepdad to Sean (Josh Hutcherson) last seen in 2008s ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Sean like his missing grandfather Alexander thinks the work of Jules Verne is based on fact. After decoding a message from Alexander Sean and Hank piece together a map from classic adventure novels (""Treasure Island"" ""20000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and ""Gullivers Travels"" have an assist) and set off to find Vernes fictitious island. Accompanied by a goofy copter pilot (Luis Guzman) and his daughter (Vanessa Hudgens) the explorers find giant insects a sinking Atlantis and Alexander (Michael Caine) a Robinson Crusoe figure with a treehouse that may inspire backyard imitations. Director Brad Peyton keeps it all very innocent the camera cuts away before young eyes get a closeup of a giant eel a humongous spider or Hudgens slightly inappropriate tank top. And Johnson knowing hes a tour guide on this retro romps is a reassuringly fatherly presence. Hutcherson though seems to be biding his time before jumping into ""Hunger Games"" and Caine may have shown up just so he can wear a safari outfit. But no matter; take the kids to a bookstore (while theyre still here) and get the source material. They dont have the Rock but they rock.

(AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Ron Phillips) Ron Phillips In this image released by Warner Bros. Pictures Vanessa Hudgens is shown in a scene from ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Ron Phillips) The makers of ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" were trying to dress it up as an adventure classic the kind with colorful characters and wondrous creatures in an exotic locale. And they would have gotten away with it too if it werent for us meddling geezers.Anyone old enough to have read Jules Verne or seen the way his work was successfully adapted in the past will suffer worse than the kids in the audience who just came to laugh.Although it borrows its title from an 1874 Verne novel the story is set in the present. Yet no effort is made to connect this sequel with 2008s equally uninspired ""Journey of the Center of the Earth"" in which modern teen Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) explored a subterranean world with his uncle (Brendan Fraser). Now a senior in high school Seans living in Ohio with his mom (Kristen Davis) and Navy-vet stepdad Hank (Dwayne Johnson). When restless Sean intercepts a coded dispatch from the uncharted South Pacific hes convinced its an invitation from explorer granddad Alexander. So with nary a peep from Mom he decides to fly halfway around the world and the inexplicably deep-pocketed Hank goes along for the ride.On the nearest inhabited island they charter a helicopter from fly-by-night tour guide Gabato (unbearable comic relief Luis Guzman) and his foxy-but-feisty daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens).Mysterious Island turns out to be a paradise with one human inhabitant free-spirited septuagenarian Alexander (Michael Caine). But Hank deduces that the volcano thats spewing gold nuggets will capsize the island in about oh two hours so they have to race across a jungle of giant creatures and find a fabled submarine that will whisk them to safety. Half a century ago when Verne novels such as ""20000 Leagues Under the Sea"" were brought to life by stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen the effect was enchanting. Now 3-D digital trickery is so commonplace even the characters seem bored by it. Notwithstanding that ""Journey 2"" is escapist entertainment for kids nobodys behavior here is remotely rooted in human DNA.Johnson is a likable larger-than-life personality and Caine is a legend so when we see them marooned on this island of misfit ideas we wish there was a time machine for a do-over.

"Review Journey 2 Mysterious Island - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Journey 2 gets wasted in paradise --  1/2 Journey 2 Dwayne Johnson stars in ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island."" Dwayne Johnson stars in ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In its own sweetly bombastic way the 2008 remake of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" did the job the job being a 21st-century 3-D bash starring Brendan Fraser -- an actor who gives his all to the green screen every time -- and loosely based on the 19th-century Jules Verne adventure a natural for the movies. Its script proceeded from the idea that Verne science fiction visionary was in reality writing about real places and genuine fantastic phenomena only disguised as fiction.Now comes the Fraserless sequel""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island.""And its only disguised as fun. Take away the 3-D shots of berries bouncing off Dwayne Johnsons vibrating pecs and you have a pretty scrawny experience. Director Brad Peyton takes the reins for ""Journey 2""; previously he gave us ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" one of the tougher sits of recent epochs.The visual quality of ""Journey 2"" is such that while Peyton and company filmed on the Hawaiian island of Oahu the results resemble ""H.R. Pufnstuf"" or the AMC theater chains concessions promo the one where placid teenagers hoisting 188-ounce cups of Coke are transported to a world akin to ""Avatar."" Carrying over from the 08 film a newly beefed-up Josh Hutcherson returns as Sean now 17 and more sullen than ever. He has survived his journey to the center of the earth but now his uncle the Fraser character is out of the picture. Seans ex-Navy stepfather (Johnson) hasnt yet breached the boys defense mechanisms.Then comes a cryptogram from Seans geographically distant grandfather (Michael Caine decked out like a veteran member of the Indiana Jones fan club) containing news that Vernes mysterious island was no imaginative figment. Sean and stepfather Hank take off to the South Pacific to investigate and hook up with an islander (Luis Guzman) with a helicopter a teenage daughter with college aspirations (Vanessa Hudgens) and a penchant for the broadest most infantile brand of mugging. Guzmans usually a lot better than this but then so is everybody in ""Journey 2.""The mysterious islands attractions include miniature elephants and giant ants but the movie is weirdly uninterested in its own critter potential beyond the giant flying bees. These can be ridden like big fuzzy flying horses but the magic isnt there. The bees wont give stop-motion effects master Ray Harryhausen who created the giant crab and other beasties for the 1961 ""Mysterious Island"" anything to worry about.Hutcherson spits his lines out as quickly as possible which you appreciate because the way the likable Johnson wrestles with his lines (""It looks like the liquefaction has tripled overnight"") you think well its a living. Capt. Nemos submarine makes an appearance as does the lost continent of Atlantis and the script by Brian Gunn and Mark Gunn sets up a promising mashup of literary antecedents (""Gullivers Travels"" and ""Treasure Island"" to go with the Verne stuff). But the promise goes unfulfilled and the film is preceded by an equally disappointing 3-D Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd cartoon ""Daffys Rhapsody"" a grating pushy comedown from the Olympian heights of ""Duck Amuck"" or the gorgeous and eternal ""Whats Opera Doc?""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Dwayne Johnsons curious habit of starring in sequels (Be Cool Race To Witch Mountain Fast Five G.I Joe Retaliation) to films he had nothing to do with continues with Journey 2 The Mysterious Island a dire follow-up to the 2008 3-D special effects extravaganza Journey To The Center Of The Earth with Johnson replacing an AWOL Brendan Fraser (who apparently finally found a green-screen he could resist) as the films lead. This adventure strands Johnsons famously animated features in eyebrow jail and squanders his outsized charisma and gift for winking self-deprecation in a thankless worried-stepfather role. It doesnt call for much beyond a lot of muscles and an ever-present look of concern for his whiny stepson. Josh Hutcherson reprises his role from Center Of The Earth as a bratty irritatingly rebellious book-loving adventurer whose overly indulgent stepfather (Johnson) takes him on a perilous bonding trip to uncover the titular land of mystery and find Hutchersons long-lost grandfather (Michael Caine). Meanwhile Luis Guzman works up a furious flopsweat as a comic-relief helicopter pilot and the father of Hutchersons arbitrary love interest (Vanessa Hudgens formerly property of the Walt Disney corporation). Mysterious Island attempts prestige-by-association by ham-fistedly incorporating elements of Jonathan Swifts Gullivers Travels and Robert Louis Stevensons Treasure Island into Jules Vernes The Mysterious Island and 20000 Leagues Under The Sea but itd be hard to imagine a blander or less-convincing advertisement for classic adventure literature. The films clumsy omnibus approach renders it a poor dumbed-down quasi-adaptation of Swift Stevenson and Verne whose works are treated largely as fact masquerading as fiction. The 3-D setpieces are the films sole raison detre but Mysterious Island doles them out stingily and its exotic setting registers as a poor mans Pandora. Journey 2 establishes a pointlessly antagonistic relationship between the ceaselessly heroic Johnson and a clearly uninterested Caine; the latter spends much of the film apathetically hurling weak insults at the former who risked life and limb to reunite Caine with his grandson. And this relationship is established solely so Caine can finally decide maybe Johnson isnt such a bad guy after all. (It takes Hutcherson nearly the entire film to reach that staggeringly obvious conclusion.) Island ends by teasing yet another fuzzily Verne-based sequel when it really should let the poor man and his much-picked-over oeuvre be.

B Journey 2 The Mysterious Island Genre Kids and Family Action/Adventure; Starring Vanessa Hudgens Dwayne Johnson Josh Hutcherson; Release Date Wide 02/10/2012; Runtime (in minutes) 94; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted February 11 2012 -- 1200 AM EST Nothing is very mysterious about Journey 2 The Mysterious Island. A moderately zany sequel to 2008s Journey to the Center of the Earth this voyage was like the first one shot in stuff-flying-at-you 3-D and also like its predecessor stars Josh Hutcherson as Sean Anderson a teenage adventurer steeped in the fantastical literature of Jules Verne Robert Louis Stevenson and Jonathan Swift. Last time Sean and company journeyed well to the center of the earth. This time guess where they go? Theres a lot riding on Hutchersons upcoming performance as Peeta Mellark in The Hunger Games. Fortunately the weight is off his slim acting chops here thanks to the lovely muscles and likability of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Seans stepfather Hank who has a fine time teaching the kid how to pop his pecs to wow the ladies. (Vanessa Hudgens plays Seans cute love interest with Luis Guzman as her excitable papa. Brendan Fraser who played Seans uncle last time around has not returned.) And matching Johnson charm for charm Michael ""The Iron Man"" Caine appears to enjoy himself playing Seans eccentric explorer grandpa Alexander. He takes pleasure in needling Hank and in riding a giant bee like a bronco. The movie flies by pleasantly and is then instantly forgettable. Perhaps Jules Verne can explain the science of that. What may remain in memory a bit longer is the accompanying Looney Tunes short Daffys Rhapsody about the existential relationship between the wily waterfowl Daffy Duck and the hapless hunter Elmer Fudd. It features the voice of the late maestro Mel Blanc taken from a Daffy song recorded in the 1950s.

Journey 2 The Mysterious Island Bad to fair Director Brad Peyton. Cast Josh Hutcherson Dwayne Johnson Michael Caine. Rating PG for some adventure action and brief mild language. This weeks new movie releases Adventure movies Spotlight Dwayne Johnson Spotlight Michael Caine Er sorry Dwayne Johnson. The former professional wrestler continues his unlikely career as the star of action-based kids movies with ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" which is based on Jules Vernes writing in much the same way a Big Mac is based on a filet mignon. Johnson cant save the movie directed by Brad Peyton from being a sloppy skip from one seemingly unrelated idea to the next. Nor can the somewhat surprising appearance of Michael Caine though this is the man who appeared in ""Jaws The Revenge"" so slumming is nothing new for him. But Johnson bless him is in there swinging giving it his best while among other things flicking his pecs while others bounce berries off them -- yes -- in a nearly non-stop plea for the audience to like him. And the effort pays off sort of in that Johnson again comes off as a thoroughly decent fellow (though was it really necessary for him to sing?). Plus the look of the film is impressive as are the effects. Overall however its a big loud 3-D-drenched jumble. Josh Hutcherson returns from the first better film ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" as Sean a smart kid who opens the movie by getting arrested. This causes dismay for his mother (Kristin Davis) and especially his stepfather Hank (Johnson). Sean has his reasons for the crime he commits but Hank is convinced rightly that Sean needs a strong male figure and his life and that he is the man for the job. Sean isnt so sure. But when Hank helps him decode a message that Sean believes is from his grandfather Alexander (Caine) who hasnt been heard from in two years Sean insists that he travel to Palau; hes convinced Alexander has discovered the Mysterious Island in Verne lore nearby. Hank is not but sensing a bonding opportunity says hell take him. And just like that off they go. Once there theyll need a ride to the supposed location of the island but no sane captain will take them. Enter Gabato (Luis Guzman) pilot of a broken-down helicopter who brings along his daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) for the trip to Seans delight. Sucked into some weather vortex the gang indeed winds up on the island and finds Alexander at which point the challenge becomes how to get back. So for the balance of the movie someone will say something like you know we really need some sort of vessel to save us. And Alexander will think for a moment and say hey in ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"" Verne wrote about the Nautilus which is probably parked on the other side of the island. So lets charge through the heart of the island and find it. And just like that off they go. Again. Creatures are encountered danger is faced and G-rated romance seems to spark between the eager Sean and the less-excited Kailani. And yes somewhere along the line Johnson warbles ""What a Wonderful World"" while accompanying himself on a ukulele. (""It takes a big man to play a small guitar"" he explains.) Hutcherson stars in the upcoming movie adaptation of ""The Hunger Games"" whose script will presumably serve him better. Hudgens isnt asked to do much more than stand around in a tank top; Caine is similarly wasted though at least hes fully clothed. Guzman provides the prototypical comic relief leaving the affable Johnson to shoulder the heavy lifting such as it is. And big shoulders they are. But no actor no matter how willing could make sense of this. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

Of the original cast and major crew only Josh Hutcherson as Sean a sulky teenaged Vernian returns. Sean is particularly moody around his stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson) who tries to connect with his charge by showing off his Navy code-breaking skills deployed when the kid needs to decipher the whereabouts of his explorer granddad (Michael Caine). The old guy is living 100 miles off the coast of Palau a destination Sean and Hank reach with the help of charter pilot Gabato (Luis Guzman clowning endlessly) and his daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens introduced rack first). Lifting plot threads from not only Verne but also Swift and Robert Louis Stevenson screenwriters Brian and Mark Gunn still have trouble scripting action sequences or dialogue that rises above ""Lets do this"" level. The film is endurable owing solely to Johnson a veteran of bad kids movies whose sense of when to dial up the charm in such a generic soulless entertainment remains impeccable. The third installment that Journey 2 sets up with hints of a voyage to the moon will have at least one ticket buyer Newt Gingrich.

As simple and direct as its abbreviated title ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" is a fun though rarely funny family adventure whose lively special effects compensate somewhat for actors who largely sleepwalk through their roles. With franchise continuity hinging solely on Josh Hutcherson reprising his role from 2008s hit ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" its up to Dwayne Johnson to fill the father-figure vacuum left by Brendan Fraser. Despite limp characterizations the eye-popping effects and Johnsons fanbase should combine to help this Warner Bros. release capitalize swimmingly on its 3D upcharge. Opening narration by Michael Caine describes sci-fi pioneer Jules Verne and the ""Vernians"" followers who believe the French novelists works offer more than just science-flavored entertainment. The pics uncredited source text is Vernes 1874 novel ""The Mysterious Island"" which has provided a rich cinematic vein in the past Multiple versions have appeared since the silent era (elements of the story were folded into 1916s ""20000 Leagues Under the Sea"" with which it shares the character of Captain Nemo) and it even inspired ABCs ""Lost."" Auds get an early taste of the pics 3D effects with an opening chase sequence in which teenager Sean Anderson (Hutcherson) having broken into a satellite tracking station is pursued on his motorcycle by cops around the suburbs of Dayton Ohio. Five years after the events of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" Sean clearly still needs a firm hand and his concerned new stepfather Hank (Johnson) hopes to provide it. Sean has gotten hold of a coded transmission that consists of character names from Verne novels and thats enough to convince him that his Vernian grandfather is sending a message. As with the first film which used its source material as a convenient guidebook to keep the plot moving Sean is certain his hardback copy of ""The Mysterious Island"" provides the clue to his granddads location. Having been a codebreaker in the Navy Hank helps Sean solve the puzzle and figure out the location of the titular Pacific island in a matter of seconds. As the boy already has been to the center of the planet with his uncle its a small matter for his mother (Kristin Davis replacing Jane Wheeler) to let him travel to the South Pacific accompanied by his stepdad low-rent helicopter pilot Gabato (Luis Guzman stuck playing the cowardly comic relief) and Gabatos fiery daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) who gets Seans pulse racing. Following a lightning storm that strands the quartet in a tropical paradise the pic finally hits its stride both in terms of effects and excitement with the appearance of a giant aggravated lizard. Coming to the rescue is Seans grandfather Alexander Anderson (the previously heard but not seen Caine) whose resemblance to Indiana Jones is emphasized by a John Williams-esque flourish in Andrew Lockingtons score. From there the proceedings are mostly stop-and-go alternating dazzling special effects with dull expository passages and flaccid character conflict much of it driven by the difference in mentoring styles between Seans competitive father figures. A belching volcano foreshadows a big finish but the pic never develops a sense of building momentum and most of the jokes fall flat. With helmer Brad Peyton (""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"") primarily invested in the CGI elements the actors often seem stuck in an energy-draining vortex; Hutcherson appears less engaged the second time around and none-too-eager for a possible third installment of the Verne-inspired franchise while Caine merely looks fatigued. Johnson at least embodies a near-shameless charm at one point warbling his way through a ukelele-backed rendition of ""What a Wonderful World."" Hudgens who spends almost the entire film in khaki shorts and tanktop and is subjected to some prurient glances by the camera provides a feisty presence even if her aggressive attitude seems more redolent of L.A. than the tropics. The unspoiled island looks supernaturally vivid the colorful backdrops seamlessly blended with North Carolina and Hawaii locations to create a persuasive impression of an actual world.

TWITTER Josh Hutcherson returns as Sean Anderson who embarks on a mission to save his grandfather with the help of his mothers boyfriend played by Dwayne Johnson. A menagerie of outsized fauna is royally upstaged by Dwayne Johnsons dancing man-boobs in Journey 2 The Mysterious Island yet another from the Verne-adaptation school of fanciful family adventure. A 3D update of one of the less widely read Jules Verne classics it follows the 2008 hit Journey to the Center of the Earth a pioneer in the 3D resurrection that reached its zenith a year later with Avatar. PHOTOS Dwayne Johnson and 26 of Hollywoods Most Popular Athletes-Turned-Actors Verne was a fantasist nonpareil but his 19th century imagination would surely have balked at the notion of berries pinging wildly off The Rocks pecs as they do in this kid-friendly excursion from Canadian director Brad Peyton (Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore). The targeted demographic however will gladly hop aboard for a cornball ride through colorful often glaringly phony sets popping with miniature elephants gold-spewing volcanoes and a monster-truck-sized lizard. For the adults theres the edifying sight of Michael Caine astride a giant bee. The New Line and Contrafilm presentation bowing in Australia January 19 before a global roll-out that reaches North America on February 10 can expect to at least equal the 250 million box office drawn by 2008s Journey. Josh Hutcherson whose teen idol status is set to hit critical mass with his upcoming role in The Hunger Games returns as intrepid young explorer Sean Anderson. In Journey he was accompanied by his uncle (played by Brendan Fraser) but this time round a cheerily self-aware Johnson as his Navy vet stepfather Hank is the responsible adult on board. VIDEOJosh Hutcherson Vanessa Hudgens and Dwayne Johnson Discover a Mysterious Island in Journey 2 Trailer Sean is now a rebellious 17-year-old and skeptical of the new father-figure chosen by his mom (Kristen Davis). The requisite male bonding ensues when Sean intercepts a coded distress signal which leads the pair to an uncharted island in the middle of the South Pacific and into the eccentric vortex of Seans adventurer grandfather Alexander (Caine). Equal and opposite attraction emerges in the form of the headstrong Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) daughter of helicopter pilot Gabato (Luis Guzman providing stale comic relief). The island is a rainbow-filled world where evolutionary anomalies abound but as the band of adventurers skips from one supersized Survivor-like challenge to the next one cant help feeling the creative potential of Vernes vision is wasted. Theres certainly nothing much here to frighten the children although Johnsons ukulele-accompanied rendition of ""What a Wonderful World"" might come close. The dense scientific discussion that characterized Vernes ""The Mysterious Island"" is boiled down to an occasional spurt of exposition - and an iPhone cameo - as screenwriters Richard Outten Brian Gunn and Mark Gunn braid together elements from that novel together with Robert Louis Stevensons Robinson Crusoe and Jonathan Swifts Gullivers Travels to produce an episodic storyline. Like Jane Austen Verne has provided a rich seam for Hollywood screenwriters to mine long after his death. There have been various cinematic adaptations of his 1874 novel; the most fondly remembered is 1961s Mysterious Island celebrated for Ray Harryhausens stop-motion animation and the buckskin micro-dress worn by Beth Rogan. That film followed the 1959 version of Journey to the Center of the Earth in the same way Journey 2 follows 2008s Journey but was considered a sequel to 20000 Leagues Under the Sea in that the megalomaniac Captain Nemo also featured. Nemo is referenced obliquely here but a glorious steam-punk rendering of the Nautilus is featured prominently eventually getting a jump-start from a gigantic electric eel in one of the films most inventive set pieces. Where the 1961 film took its make-believe seriously Peyton is content creating a series of visual spectacles. Johnson sets the tone with an affable goofiness although never ignites the spark that his labored banter with Caine requires.
