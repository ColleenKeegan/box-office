Why take a film that has barely aged a day since its release in 1990 and subject it to the CGI remake treatment? The second equally pressing question is Who? What director worth his stripes would even attempt such a folly and who could he persuade to be in it? To be fair Total Recall isnt the unmitigated disaster many had predicted. Its future world is nicely detailed if deeply derivative (rain neon Chinese people on bikes) the action sequences occasionally spark and the central conceit of an economically and socially divided Earth linked by a lift passing through the planets core is interesting enough to almost - almost - begin to justify the project.But the positives end there. As Doug Quaid the seemingly ordinary Joe who finds out hes really a double-agent super spy Colin Farrell manages to be even less convincing than Arnold Schwarzenegger. The women in his life especially Kate Beckinsale in the badass Sharon Stone role are beyond dull while poor Bill Nighy is relegated to a few portentous lines before being unceremoniously knocked off.But the real culprit here is director Len Wiseman. Theres no denying his eye for a surprising angle and an unusual location - theres a chase sequence set in and around a series of thundering cuboid elevators that could have been truly special. But the editing is so confusing and the action so logic- and consequence-free that it swiftly becomes almost unwatchable. The big showcase finale as Bryan Cranston leads his robot troops into battle is crushingly tedious lights flash explosions blare everyone yells and its nigh-on impossible to tell whats going on. Total Recall is Hollywood at its worst pointless witless and so very unnecessary.

Of course Im talking about the 19 original starring Arnie directed by Paul Verhoeven and at the time the most expensive movie ever made. He also directed Robocop which is another classic I love from back in the day and this was also remade. I thought Id hate it but they did enough things different with it to make it a film that stands up in its own right. Not so with Total Recall directed by Len Wiseman.The plot is basically the same that is a factory worker has dreams of a life far more exciting than his own and so goes off to a company called Rekall to have some memories implanted. Of course things go wrong and hes sucked into a world of espionage where he plays a secret agent trying to save the world. Is it real is it all a dream? Who knows? Well in this movie you pretty much do know as they signpost things so heavily before they happen its ridiculous. The movie is now set totally on Earth where workers travel through the core in a massive kind of shuttle to work in a Bladerunner style slum in Australia and head back to the Federation of Great Britain - these being the only two inhabitable places on Earth after a massive disaster.Whats weird is the amount of things theyve shoehorned in here to nod to the original which only serves to remind us how much better the first one was. A three-boobed lady appears for no real reason. This was fine in the mutant enclosure on MARS but is totally weird on Earth. Theyve also done a retake on the ""2 weeks"" scene where Quaid wears a holographic disguise but the 2 Weeks lady is in front of him just going through passport control again seeking to remind you how great and surprising that original scene was The movie is also covered in unnecessary lens flare. Why?There are some positives. Theres a great action scene around some horizontal and vertical elevators where they are escaping killer droids and theres a super anti-gravity section scene when the shuttle travels through the Earths core - some really good sci-fi ideasIts just a shame that the movie rides on the coat tails of the original - they would have been better off moving away from the story and concentrating on making something a bit more original.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 12 2012KevinFeaturedFantastic ignore reviews and dont think of the original film.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 21 2012AlanFeaturedSo different from the original that it shouldnt be compared with it.

Its completely pointless - why even bother pretending its a remake of the original movie when all the good bits have been removed? Where are the mutants? My hopes were raised with the appearance of the triple-boobed woman but it seems she was just a woman with three boobs What happened to Mars? Why the American accents if it all took place in a version of Britain and Australia? Im sure I wasnt the only one watching who found Kate Beckinsales hairdo really annoying - it just kept getting bigger and wavier and it kept getting into her eyes during fights. There was no real sense of purpose about anything - why was that big elevator such a threat to humanity? Was so disappointed that there was no creepy little psychic muppet guy or any big red bug thing that Colin Farrell had to pull out of his nostril The look of it was dull and monochrome.

The 1990 original didnt look or sound like anything wed seen before with its mix of intriguing ideas cutting-edge special effects and overblown violence courtesy of the never-subtle director Paul Verhoeven. The new version starts off well enough but winds up being just another loud busy effects-driven movie where the human element is superficial at best. When it was over I didnt feel energized; I was worn down. Colin Farrell does a good job in the lead so long as you dont compare him with Arnold Schwarzenegger who owned--and helped define--the earlier film. Whether or not you admire that movie it made an impression. With a new generation of visual effects at his command director Len Wiseman has the ability to paint on a broader canvas but since we see this caliber of movie magic on a regular basis its no longer an Event. The one exception is a gripping chase scene involving futuristic hovercraft vehicles this is unquestionably the highlight of the picture. The central premise about a man who has had his memory wiped clean and replaced along with a new identity derives from Philip K. Dicks short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale."" Both movies use it as a springboard for the screenwriters inventions turning the film into more of an action vehicle with science-fiction overtones. Comparisons are odious but inevitable like Schwarzenegger Sharon Stone (not yet a major star) made a tremendous impact in the earlier movie as she transformed herself from Arnolds beautiful wife into a ruthless fighting machine. In the equivalent role Kate Beckinsale uses her physicality quite well but it no longer comes as a shock. What drags the movie down in its second half is the wearying sense that none of the principal characters are truly human at all theyre indestructible repeatedly surviving high falls and beatings that by any measure of reason should turn them into pulp. The new screenplay by Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback doesnt try to copy the Verhoeven film verbatim which is to its credit. But what we get instead is unexceptional and thats too bad.

Photo Credit Sony advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In a dystopian future a lowly factory worker discovers his mind holds multiple secrets. BOTTOM LINE Like the extras pummeled by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1990 original toothless wobbly and incoherent. CAST Colin Farrell Kate Beckinsale Jessica Biel Bryan Cranston DIRECTOR Len Wiseman LENGTH 118 Whats the difference between the ""Total Recall"" in theaters today and the original film from 1990? It comes down to this One is a high-water mark of the action-blockbuster era an R-rated splatter-fiesta directed at full tilt by Paul Verhoeven (""RoboCop"") and starring that charismatic combo of beef and ham Arnold Schwarzenegger. The other is a PG-13 movie with Colin Farrell. advertisement | advertise on newsday Sorry if the comparisons are unfair but the new ""Total Recall"" invites them cracking inside jokes for fans but failing to improve on its predecessor. Remember that three-breasted prostitute? She and her twin cleavage return. But what about that giant techno-booger that came out of Arnolds nose? Or the bullet-riddled corpse he used as a shield? Or his double-arm amputation of the movies villain? Theyre not here and the new ""Total Recall"" is too timid to replace them. The story based on a 1966 short story by Philip K. Dick remains roughly the same In a dystopian future factory worker Doug Quaid (Farrell squirrelly but unimposing) hopes to replace his nightmares with pleasant-memory implants from the company Rekall. The process however triggers deadly reflexes Quaid didnt know he had. Soon his wife (Kate Beckinsale) betrays him a pretty insurgent (Jessica Biel) rescues him and Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston) seems to have big plans for him. Director Len Wiseman invents some dandy chase sequences especially one through a crisscrossing maze of elevator cubicles but its Beckinsale the pursuer whos the most fun to watch. Nasty funny and hellishly tenacious she throws off the only real sparks in the movie. ""Total Recall"" is a toned-down smoothed-out version of an amped-up bug-eyed classic. Remember those deformed mutants who ended the original film by gazing hopefully toward a new dawn? Theyre not here either. 201 VideoTotal Recall Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"The Total Recall remake reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Total Recall Not a Total Waste of Time Total Recall Not a Total Waste of Time Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 3 2012 619 PM Total Recall Not a total waste of time. By Dana Stevens Quaid (Colin Farrell) seated in the Mind Trip Chair inside the Rekall Tripping Den in Total Recall. Michael Gibson/Columbia Pictures (c) 2011. After youve watched Total Recall come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion with Dana Stevens and Chris Wade. You can also download the podcast here. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Philip K. Dick story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" like much of Dicks work seems at once wildly cinematic and in its essence unfilmable. The Moebius-strip structure of this futuristic tale proposes two alternate realities that seem to shift and morph into one another Either the protagonist is an everyday working schmo who pays to take a ""virtual vacation"" to Mars at a memory-implant firm called Rekal Incorporated or hes a secret government agent who actually has spent time on Mars and whose memory of what happened there has been imperfectly erased by Rekal in an attempt to make him believe hes just a working schmo. The stunning ending which leaves open the possibility that both scenarios may be true while also suggesting the hero may be a raving madman is an example of the kind of conceptual gymnastics that great science fiction can perform. Of course movie adaptations from works of literature arent only worthwhile to the extent that they resemble the stories theyre based on. Paul Verhoevens 1990 thriller Total Recall preserved only the bare bones premise of Dicks short story while replacing its tone of bleak noir pessimism with one of cheerfully gonzo high camp. But the original Total Recall is a blast of a movie full of hairpin plot twists and wittily choreographed action not to mention the unforgettably bizarre so-wrong-its-right casting of Arnold Schwarzenegger as everyman hero Douglas Quaid. (The ascension of an inexpressive heavily accented Austrian bodybuilder to the pinnacle of Hollywood stardom and from there to the governorship of California is an alternate reality not even Dick could have imagined.) Advertisement The new Total Recall remake directed by the Underworld franchises Len Wiseman relies more closely on the 1990 movie than on the original source. But that old Verhoeven joie de vivre--the supersaturated colors the broad performances the gleefully high body count--has been replaced with a more fashionable brand of techno-gloom. Everything of note in this movie is pretty much a straight lift from another better science fiction movie The sharpest story turns all come straight from the 1990 version while the impressively layered production design ransacks Blade Runner for visual ideas (the vertically stacked city the competing multilingual signage). Theres even a white-clad robot army that seems to have gone AWOL en masse from Star Wars. In Wisemans version the Mars angle has dropped out entirely (perhaps for some of the reasons Bryan Curtis mentions in his discussion of science fictions retreat from the Red Planet). Instead the earth itself has become uninhabitable territory after a chemical-warfare disaster. Only two spots on the planet remain habitable the ominous ""United Federation of Britain"" and the entire continent of Australia now known as ""the Colony."" The Colonys inhabitants must travel from their squalid overcrowded (but cool-as-hell-looking) slums to their menial jobs in the wealthy Federation via the earths only remaining means of long-distance travel the Fall a huge elevator that drops clear through the core of the earth and dumps you out on the other side. (The Fall is one element of the story thats new to this version and I kind of loved the completeness with which the whole absurd thing was imagined from the design of the landing docks to the detail that the entire Colony-to-UFB voyage takes only 17 minutes. Why isnt American ingenuity already at work on this exciting new travel technology? Lets get tunneling) Colony-dwelling sad sack Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell) dreams of a more exciting and glamorous life--he even reads a James Bond paperback as he commutes on the Fall (which this being the end of the 21st century is very retro of him.) Ignoring the warnings of his co-worker (Bokeem Woodbine) Quaid insists on visiting the offices of Rekall where he pays for a chemical implant that will give him a false memory of a thrilling past. And heres where the story bifurcates and the whoa-dude sci-fi ideas kick in What happens next and for the rest of the movie could be either Quaids paranoid post-implantation delusion or a real quest to liberate the Colony from its conniving occupier Cohagen (Bryan Cranston) while being pursued by a ruthless assailant who up until that very morning Quaid had assumed was his loving wife. The icily impenetrable Kate Beckinsale Wisemans wife in real life plays a woman so dedicated to her task she starts to resemble a video-game villain--whenever theres a lull in the action out she pops from the shadows for another round of kickboxing. Jessica Biel as the nice girl (or maybe just a hologram of a nice girl) who helps Quaid adjust to his new identity is so physically similar to Beckinsale its sometimes hard to tell them apart--perhaps a deliberate choice on the directors part but if so he should have included more scenes that played on the resemblance. As for Farrell his sad-eyed permanently quizzical face is well-suited for playing a character whose identity keeps becoming subject to erasure. Just because its rarely original doesnt mean Total Recall is never any fun; this is a taut serviceable sci-fi thriller with a couple of neat visual ideas and if youre not familiar with either the Schwarzenegger version or the original story the brain-bending twists alone will take you a reasonably long way.

Thus began the 1966 Philip K. Dick short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" a mind-bending little fable of memory implantation and erasure. But then in 1990 along came the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle Total Recall which was loosely based on Dicks story. And I think its fair to say that the films interplanetary shenanigans left an awful lot of moviegoers wanting anything but Mars.So give the new Total Recall remake this if not a whole lot else Theres no Mars in it. In this telling directed by Len Wiseman and starring Colin Farrell an apocalyptic war has rendered the Earth uninhabitable with the exceptions of the United Federation of Britain and ""the Colony"" a.k.a. Australia. The relationship between the two is not all that different from the one that prevailed in the 18th century except that rather than send its criminals to New South Wales Britain instead has its work force commute in daily from there. This commute might seem impractical but its actually a great deal shorter--and vastly vastly sillier--than youd imagine a 17-minute ride through the center of the earth in a massive train named like the extravagant roller coaster it resembles all too much ""the Fall."" (Insert Milton joke here.) Yes thats why rather improbably the only habitable zones on Earth are Britain and Australia The filmmakers needed two places roughly on opposite sides of the globe and international market or no international market they werent prepared to go with Indonesia and Brazil. MORE ON FILM Philip K. Dicks Messy Mindbending Cinematic Legacy How Aurora Changed The Dark Knight Rises In Movies with Nudity Whats the Line Between Ogling and Art? Colin Farrell Needs to Get Desperate Two Movies That Show Why Society Turns Criminals Into Celebrities Farrell plays Doug Quaid a colonist who works in a British factory assembling the very security robots that ensure his second-class citizenship. Every night he dreams that he and a beautiful woman (Jessica Biel) are breaking out of a secure facility. And every morning he awakes next to his beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) in his drab Colony apartment craving adventure. Eventually this desire leads him to Rekall a firm that specializes in the implanting of false memories where he asks the technicians to cater to his fantasy of being a secret agent. But the implantation fails because it turns out he actually is a secret agent--one involved in missions so clandestine that in Bournesque fashion his handlers decided to erase his memory. In no time he has hooked up with the woman from his dream (a member of the resistance) and the two are running for their lives from platoons of government enforcers and robots led by his erstwhile wife (herself of course also a secret agent).And running and running and running. Dicks original short story was a crafty witty little brain-tease but like its 1990 predecessor Wisemans Total Recall basically uses the rough framework as an excuse for a litany of action sequences shoot-outs blow-ups chases on foot and in hover-car. And while these sequences are perfectly competent theyre not nearly inventive enough to sustain the movies flimsy narrative. An hour in I was wishing that I too could wake up--with or without Kate Beckinsale.Total Recall is inane in all the ways you might expect from a second-tier summer action-movie and a few you probably would not For instance if my rudimentary arithmetic can be relied upon in order to meet its schedule the Fall would have to travel through the planet at an average speed of around 28000 miles per hour. The movies look is stylish enough but it is borrowed to the point of plagiarism from prior Dick adaptations Minority Report and especially Blade Runner. (The dingy perpetually rain-soaked Colony resembles nothing so much as the latters Los Angeles after a few additional decades of neglect.) Colin Farrell is not bad exactly but his performance offers yet more evidence that he is best in smaller films (In Bruges) or smaller roles (Minority Report). Yes we have come a long way from the pituitary excess of the Schwarzenegger era and haunted emo-assassins now dot the filmic landscape. But refreshing though it is in many respects Farrells lack of inherent alpha-ness makes him a poor fit for action star his eyebrows perpetually poised to teeter outward in sadness or confusion as if they might just fall off the sides of his face.Biel and Beckinsale are essentially interchangeable bites of ass-kicking eye candy though it is perhaps a bit of cinemato-karmic justice that the former (who played a vampire hunter in Blade III) spends this film being chased by the latter (who played a vampire in the Underworld films). The ubiquitous Bryan Cranston shows up as the scheming British head of state and Bill Nighy is badly wasted as the sonorous leader of the resistance. As for Wisemans direction it does little to challenge the presumption that he is in the business primarily as an excuse to film his wife (Beckinsale whom he also directed in two Underworld movies) slinking about in form-fitting bodysuits. I was no particular fan of the first Total Recall but I confess that this flat by-the-numbers remake made me a tad nostalgic for its bombastic preposterousness the high-tech Halloween masks (the movie actually won an Oscar for its special effects) and conjoined telepaths and Considuh daht a divhorce. Wisemans film almost--almost--made me want Mars.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Sanderson on how men and women experience marital satisfaction differently Whenever Im walking around D.C. with friends on sunny Saturday afternoons we inevitably see lots of babies adorable fat charmingly bald babies. Its not uncommon to hear sighs of ""oh my gosh hes so precious"" and ""I want one"" from my companions; I too have been accused of being a baby stalker from time to time. But at The Atlantics One Day University event on Saturday Amherst psychology professor Catherine A. Sanderson made a convincing case that cute kids (and cute husbands and wives) might seem different when theyre yours to keep. She gave a witty lecture on what social science can tell us about happiness and these were my three biggest take-aways First I will no longer have to worry about being awesome if I get married because my husband will probably be happier for having taken vows regardless of how great I am. In studies of marital satisfaction over time Sanderson said ""there is in fact a positive correlation for some people. Guess who those people are? Men. For men yeah being married makes you happier and the good news is it doesnt matter at all who youre married to. It could be like a mail-order bride from Russia--does not matter at all.""

At area theaters. ""Total Recall"" looks like a movie. The sci-fi-tinged flick set in the near future has the hurtling action of a summer blockbuster. It has chases. It rides on the rapport of gunfire and an incessant score meant to get the adrenaline pumping. In Colin Farrell Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel the movie features easy-on-the-eyes stars capable of fine performances. Farrell is even better than that. With his brown doe eyes he makes his characters confusion his own. When Douglas Quaid discovers that he might not be the regular guy he believes he is he says ""Everyone seems to know me but me."" Farrell makes that one of the movies better lines. ""Total Recall"" dangles in front of us craggy veteran co-stars Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy. Both can usually turn the paltry into a watchable moment. Yes "" Total Recall"" has the promise of a movie. But directed by Len Wiseman of the ""Underworld"" franchise its more like a memory of a movie or a number of them. While this may sound perfect for a sci-fi thriller about memories -- real and manufactured -- its hardly satisfying. Whatever tug ""Total Recall"" has on the imagination comes from the vague sense weve seen it all before. And seen it better from Christopher Nolans ""Inception"" to Ridley Scotts ""Blade Runner."" Like Scotts sci-fi classic the inspiration here is a short story by the master of dystopian fantasy Philip K. Dick. (The 1990 Mars adventure of the same name starring Arnold Schwarzenegger took liberties with the same source Dicks ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale."") In this reboot a global catastrophe has left only two inhabited territories on Earth the United Federation of Britain controlled by Chancellor Cohaagen (Cranston) and the Colony on the other side of the planet. The former exploits the people from down under transporting them to factories via a super-charged elevator called ""the Fall."" But a resistance movement is simmering led by mysterious rebel leader Matthias (Nighy). Quaid is one of the workers from the Colony employed to assemble ""synths"" robots that resemble ""Star Wars"" storm-troopers. Hes happily married to Lori (Beckinsale) but nagged by nightmares and a depressing sense of workplace ennui. At the end of a wage-slave day the Colonists are sent back to their grimy lives which many seem to avoid by taking in slightly rancid pleasures. (A prostitute propositions Quaid by flashing three ample breasts in this PG-13 film.) A company called Rekall offers mind-tripping respites. Strap yourself into a chair don electrodes live out a fantasy and head home with fresh memories of your adventure. Quaid visits Rekall. But before his adventure can begin hes plunged into a world exactly like the one he opted for one where hes either a rebel or a double agent. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Is he accessing authentic memories or being manipulated? And why does his wife want to kill him all of a sudden? Beckinsale embraces the combat and her characters physical skill set is even more lethal than Quaids. The filmmakers tease the ideas of doubling and double-crossing even further by casting Biel as the rebel fighter Melina who vaguely resembles Lori. Melina arrives in the nick of time to save Quaid. Too bad she cant do the same for the film. Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 lkennedydenverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy ""TOTAL RECALL."" Directed by Len Wiseman.

Probably not many. Maybe thats a good thing.The reboot starring Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel is set in a futuristic world rendered almost uninhabitable by chemical warfare. Farrell is an assembly line worker who despite his beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) wants to spice up his life by visiting Rekall a company that through medical injection converts the patients fantasies into real memories. Things of course go completely haywire. Once Farrell is injected soldiers burst onto the scene and he spends the rest of the movie on the run or on the hunt. Is he a superspy or is this just his fantasy?The problem with all this is that the characters are little more than bots so all the existential angst of the premise courtesy of a Philip K. Dick story is moot. Director Len Wiseman is good on action and Patrick Tatopouluss dystopic production design is within hailing distance of ""Blade Runner"" his chief influence. But essentially this is a big-screen video game. Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action some sexual content brief nudity and language.)

If you subtract all the metaphysical illusion-versus-reality nonsense Philip K. Dicks Walter Mitty story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" on which both films are based is basically a middle-age power fantasy by a middle-age writer in which an insignificant schlub discovers that his wife is a bitch and that his true identity is a secret agent. Infantile but fun The increasingly Fred Flintstonian Colin Farrell is Douglas Quaid a discontented line worker down at the RoboCop factory who visits a bento-bar-looking company called Rekall for an escapist memory implant. After going all Krav Maga on a futuristic SWAT team he discovers that hes actually a memory-wiped soldier in militant resistance movement. Or is he? Where Paul Verhoevens original was testosterone-stupid and therefore fun Wisemans film is just boring-stupid. Instead of the planet Mars this remake conjures Ye Olde Future Londontowne and instead of Johnny Cabs and giant drills it shamelessly recycles the exact same Maglev highway system from Minority Report. In fact anything interesting is appropriated from better sources the rain-and-neon set designs from Blade Runner the udder-endowed prostitute from the first Total Recall the floating platforms of Super Mario World and the parkour-inflected action of the Bourne films. The nods toward memorable scenes from the Schwarzenegger film include one airport-security gag with an anticlimax so thunderingly dull that you wonder why they bothered. And why do all of the TV screens in the future go back to having visually discernible raster-scan lines? That is some dial-up-modem shit right there but its obviously something Wiseman saw in some other film--Brazil maybe--and snatched up magpie-like for reuse.Film Details Total Recall RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time121 min.

As he fights to get his identity back at least in bits and pieces he must outmaneuver the government stooges who reprogrammed him and are now out to hunt him down. Sound familiar? Those who buy a ticket to Total Recall may not go in expecting a generic Bourne sequel but thats about what theyll be getting -- just set in a Blade Runner universe made of giant gray Lego blocks. The movie takes a token stab at toying around with the notions of thought and personality that animated Philip K. Dicks 1966 short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" on which the screenplay is negligibly based. Farrells Douglas Quaid first has his memory jogged when he goes in for a session at Rekall a company that sells virtual vacations. In the 1990 version of Total Recall (a lively conceptual action ride that came out just as virtual reality was becoming the hot new thing) the whole idea that you could strap on a headset and ""escape"" to a different plane of existence just by having your synapses tickled got quite a workout. In the new version that notion is barely part of the movie. And thats because the filmmaker Len Wiseman who directed two of the Underworld films (and wrote or co-wrote all four of them) isnt really interested in the story; hes an action futurist who directs like a videogame junkie. The new Total Recall has chases gunfights hand-to-hand combat one fairly cool car race set on a highway of tomorrow and many other things that youve seen before. As the movie went on I could feel it recycling my own memories -- of sci-fi films I actually care about. There are a few good bits of business like a glowing digital phone embedded in Colin Farrells hand or a stack of money with a certain presidents picture on the bills and the Blade Runner visuals derivative as they may be are impressive in a grimy-grand way. Less so is the army of government enforcers outfitted in boringly familiar white-and-black Imperial Stormtrooper armor. Every time they show up for another blam blam battle sequence the movie becomes infuriatingly impersonal. Farrell who can be such a good actor is reduced here to an arsenal of squints and the two actresses hes paired with are turned into good and evil eye candy Kate Beckinsale curling her lips with disdain as Quaids duplicitous wife and Jessica Biel who has an urgent energy (if almost zero dimension) as his fellow agent?turned?amorous action partner. Dicks short story is just a few pages long yet it bristles with ideas -- of brain manipulation of identity created by commerce -- that are more relevant than ever. Total Recall updates the story into a trite Parable For Our Times about how an action-stud savior must lead the oppressed masses in a revolt against the controlling elite. The 1990 movie was no great shakes but it was punchy and (moderately) inventive and even when it got overly thrill-ride schlocky it stayed fun. This one is somberly kinetic and joyless.

"Total Recall remake Less than memorable |       NJ.com comments Total Recall remake Less than memorable Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 03 2012 at 736 AM View/Post Comments COLUMBIA PICTURESColin Farrell takes on one of Arnold Schwarzeneggers signature roles in the new ""Total Recall."" Recall ""Total Recall""? You know the Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi movie from 1990? Guy buys a fake memory as a sort of vacation but then uncovers a real memory of a past hes forgotten? Sharon Stone as his lethal wife? A trip to airless Mars? A woman with three breasts? ""Consider dis a divorce."" Well its sort of back minus Arnie and the Red Planet plus some shiny new effects. But other than that its very familiar and a little tiresome -- a long loud monochromatic mediocrity. It stars Colin Farrell -- who for a few years after his ""Miami Vice"" disaster seemed to be serious about getting back to his small-scale dramatic roots -- as Douglas Quaid a blue-collar grunt. Or is he? Because once that memory trip goes wrong he begins to think hes Hauser a super-secret agent whos working for the anti-government rebels. Or maybe hes working for the government. Hes not sure. The name Hauser made me think of ""Hausers Memory"" a decent 1970 TV movie about implanted recollections. The city Farrell lives in made me think of ""Blade Runner"" with its Chinatown style and constant rain. The actual movie though didnt make me think at all. Director Len Wiseman -- known best for producing all those ""Underworld"" films with Kate Beckinsale -- drives the movie like a car with one gear and no brakes. Its just flat out all the time -- theres never a chance to breathe let alone puzzle over the plot. Which is a problem because like the first ""Total Recall"" (and ""Blade Runner"" ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and a few other sci-fi films) this movie comes from a story by the mystic slightly mad Philip K. Dick. If he was about anything it was big ideas. But this movie is about nothing. It has no ideas. Farrell mostly looks worried knitting his formidable eyebrows into a wooly scarf. Beckinsale -- in a bigger version of Stones part -- runs around in boots and very tight pants kicking things. Shes one of the bad guys trying to kill Farrell before he remembers too much; Jessica Biel is one of the good guys trying to get him to go deeper. Occasionally the two fight over him their cheekbones carving up the scenery like scythes. Biel is actually an underrated actress but shes underused here. Beckinsale has one expression -- a vague soft-porn look with her mouth hanging open and her hair in a careful tangle -- and uses it a lot. Caught between these two Amazons Farrell just worries more. The effects look great but is that even worth noting when smart high-schoolers can make monsters on their laptops? What movies effects dont look great these days? What counts is if they look different -- and the hovercraft cars and shiny white policeman droids all look like things weve seen before. Eventually the leader of the rebels shows up and turns out to be Bill Nighy (another ""Underworld"" veteran) and a full-scale civil war breaks out. More stuff blows up more plate glass shatters more people jump from very tall things and more of this forgettable movie unfolds wiping your mind clean almost as soon as it enters. But dont worry. You dont have to go to the Rekall Corporation to have the memory of a good movie implanted. All you have to do is click on Netflix and see whats streaming. Ratings note The film contains violence brief nudity and strong language. Total Recall (PG-13) Columbia (118 min.) Directed by Len Wiseman.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 03 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 03 2012 1217PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Len Wiseman Written by Kurt Wimmer Mark Bomback Starring Colin Farrell Kate Beckinsale Bryan Cranston Jessica Biel Classification 14A Country USA Language English I confess to lacking total recall of Total Recall but somewhere in my misty memory of 1990 these first impressions linger It was a sci-fi vehicle for Arnie; it borrowed its little Proustian conceit from a Philip K. Dick short story; it was mild fun mainly dumb largely forgettable and loud; it made money. Well imagine my embarrassment now. All these years and a few cultural downshifts later I have come to learn that more than just a wooden actor Schwarzenegger was a worthy occupant of high political office and no mere cash cow Total Recall was an important classic clamouring for a remake. Oh happy day - the wait is over. Colin Farrell in Total Recall. YouTube frame grab. Film Total Recall 2012 - Official Trailer Arnold Schwarzenegger in Total Recall (1990). Film Total Recall 1990 - trailer But a warning to all you purists out there Changes have been wrought not simply to the star (Arnie out Colin Farrell in) and the director (Paul Verhoeven absent Len Wiseman present) but to the tale itself which hews a bit more closely to Dicks version. So the planet Mars fails to make an appearance in this outing; instead the setting is limited to the no-longer-friendly confines of Earth. Its the not-too-distant future after global chemical warfare has reduced our habitable terrain to two separate if unequal locales - the United Federation of Britain which rules and The Colony which is ruled. The former is a spiffy place that along with the inevitably snooty imperialists boasts multitiered expressways and levitating cars and sundry other CGI adornments. The latter is a postapocalyptic cesspool where noirish rain doth ever fall. Thats where Doug Quaid (Farrell) makes his humble home.Happily travel between the rulers and the ruled is facilitated by the Fall - no not a ride at Wonderland but an elevator that tunnels through the very core of the Earth to connect UFB and Colony. Apparently it offers a faster commute than your garden-variety train plane or levitating automobile. By day Doug elevators to work toiling on the assembly line at a robot factory. By night despite the ministrations of his lovely wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) hes a tad unhappy with his quotidian lot. Thus touring the local demi-monde the lad takes a pass on the three-breasted hooker (such a welcome returnee from 1990) but is seduced by the offer at the ""Rekall"" shop - to supplant his mundane memories with a more exciting brand. Doug opts for ""The Secret Agent"" package but oops ...Hey maybe he really is a secret agent or at least a neo-George Washington poised to liberate The Colony from those frightful Brits. And maybe the lovely Lori is out to kill him and the similarly lovely Melina (Jessica Biel) is keen to save him. Whatever theres no maybe about the action which in the efficient if uninspired hands of Wiseman kicks off and trucks on with scarcely an expository pause. Naturally those levitating cars get to chasing each other followed by the usual ritual of capture/escape/rinse and repeat. At one point our confused hero does stop to seek his identity in a safety deposit box - an old trope that along with his lost memory beckons to the Bourne series. As for the pivotal Is-It-Real-Or-Is-It-Memorex? sequence its vaguely suspenseful and perfectly in keeping with everything else here factory-issue quality much like the robots.Mainly though Doug just barrels on toward the fireballs and bigger bangs - or in current Hollywood parlance the third act. En route Farrell infuses the role with a pop-eyed perplexity but it must be said fails to measure down to Arnies cardboard standards. Alas that probably rules him out for a second career. As we all know B-actors make for the best politicians - theyre just so good at awkwardly feigning sincerity. Speaking of which todays Total Recall does nothing to tarnish the image of yesterdays - 22 years from now I expect it to be hailed as a classic.

Photo ( ) Memo to ""Total Recall"" villains Less speaking more slaying OK? Why punch somebody with a fist thats holding a gun? When deploying a stick-on grenade dont leave so much time on the clock that your victims have time for dinner and a show. And please you robo-soldiers providing backup? Youve got the most permeable battle wear since the Ewoks killed all those storm troopers with their flying toothpicks. What is your armor made of? Chinet? The original Arnold Schwarzenegger movie was perfection -- a moonbeam James Bond better than any actual James Bond movie. The central pleasure of the movie was its twists and as the same twists got rolled out in the remake I kept thinking ""Yes that was surprising to me in 1990."" This time the ordinary-guy worker Doug Quaid is played by a baffled-looking Colin Farrell -- his first big-budget leading role in six years. All his previous efforts flopped suggesting some studio chieftain had his memory bank wiped. PHOTOS BIG-SCREEN REMAKES Quaid is an assembly-line drone from ""the Colony"" -- Australia. This is one of two areas on late-21st-century Earth that didnt get smoked by chemical warfare the other being ""the United Federation of Britain."" The cool Mars angle from the original movie? Gone. Instead were in a retro future remembered wholesale from ""Blade Runner"" -- architectural charm of East Berlin tranquility of Hong Kong rain like a planet weeping for itself. The effect is junkyard dazzling or would be if we hadnt seen it before. Quaid in a bid to spice up his drab life visits Rekall an outfit that implants fake memories in those who cant afford the real thing. He asks for the secret-agent package and everything goes haywire because he really is a secret agent. His memory jogged by a resistance fighter (Jessica Biel) he goes to war with the oppressive ruling regime. In Paul Verhoevens R-rated original there was a crazy sense of humor and a crazier sense that anything could happen -- a three-breasted hooker Schwarzie ramming a gadget the size of a dumbbell up his nose to clear a tracking device Mars atmosphere making heads explode. You could believe it all except maybe that Sharon Stone could be anyones hausfrau. This time though the surplus-mammary chick seems as desperate as a YouTube exhibitionist. And once you note that Kate Beckinsale plays the Stone role you know whats going to happen. Unlike Stone Beckinsale vastly overstays her welcome doing the same things again and again and effectively being the co-lead. Which is what you get when youre married to the director (Len Wiseman a hack who previously was safely confined to those dreary ""Underworld"" movies). Wiseman is a shootouts-and-fireballs man the kind of guy born to do 30-second effects-heavy commercials. Hes bewildered or maybe just bored when the to-do list contains items called ""story"" and ""character"" and ""dialogue."" (The only attempts at humor are a few grim wife jokes.) Wisemans main idea is this Dozens of dispensable henchmen surround the hero. He elbows someone in the face grabs a gun blammo blammo and suddenly everybodys improbably dead. Or someone poses as someone else theres some light badinage and just when suspicion is creeping in here comes the hopelessly too-late assassination attempt. Or someone very slowly sprays an arc of gunfire around the space so slowly that nonsubsidiary figures can run out of harms way as those Chinet soldiers fall by the score. There is plenty in the way of fun gadgets (such as phones implanted in hands) and chase-scene chaos to keep things moving but as involved as all the action is it isnt involving. Elevators whoosh horizontally as well as vertically. Hovercars zoom and crash. But where is the heart? When we think were going to get an answer Bill Nighy pops up as the leader of the resistance. Hes been mentioned in half a dozen scenes so we know hes important. But all he does is expel half a page of gibberish that sounds like the lyric sheet to a 1975 progressive rock album before hes forgotten. Why even bother with this character? As for a villain you could do worse than Bryan Cranston as the evil political overlord who is trying to stamp out the resistance. But heres the thing about evil political overlords They dont do fistfights. Theyre too busy ruling the world. When he goes mano a mano with Farrell its not spine-tingling. Its embarrassing like watching a dude beat up his dad. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Villain for Thor sequel announced Read Next Villain for Thor sequel announced Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 43710 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 28221 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17148 Braves Brian McCann interest may pave way for Gary Sanchez Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Starring Colin Farrell Kate Beckinsale Director Len Wiseman Release Opened Aug 3 2012  Editorial Review Remake is almost memorableBy Jen ChaneyFriday August 3 2012Please erase from your minds the first ""Total Recall"" that campy 1990 Paul Verhoeven blockbuster in which Arnold Schwarzenegger pays a company to implant Mars vacation memories in his brain. Block out the sight of those robot-driven Johnny Cabs and all of the gratuitous blood-splattering violence. If you can dismiss the image of that weird mutant chick with three breasts. Pretend none of it ever happened. Then watch the 2012 version of ""Total Recall"" which like the original is loosely based on the 1966 Philip K. Dick story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" and also about a guy in the not-too-distant future attempting to escape his ordinariness by injecting more exciting memories into his cerebrum. Because while it may not be a fully realized take on Dicks forward-thinking work its still a far better film than the Verhoeven version. Oh and it also features a woman with three breasts. Some remnants of the past apparently deserve to be revisited. The movies opening initially suggests that this whole exercise might be nothing more than a ""Recall"" rehash. As Douglas Quaid the role formerly occupied by Schwarzenegger Colin Farrell awakens from a dream in which hes trying to save a striking brunette (Jessica Biel) from some vague moment of doom. As he arises from the bed he shares with a wife who also happens to be striking (Kate Beckinsale in place of Sharon Stone) he is nagged by the sense that he should be doing something more important than commuting halfway across planet Earth to work daily on a police drone assembly line. This is where the plot of ""Total Recall"" 2.0 begins to diverge. Quaid resides on planet Earth circa 2084 an environment thats part ""Blade Runner"" part ""Minority Report"" and entirely divided into two nations the United Federation of Britain ruled by the intimidating Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston) and the Colony home of poor disheveled masses such as Quaid. Instead of seeking a mind trip to Mars our protagonist just wants to be someone else. That desire is what takes him to Rekall a memory-adjustment business thats New Age-ier in this version but just as capable of wreaking mega-havoc when its procedure reveals that perhaps Quaid is already more ""extraordinary"" than he thought. So what makes this 2012 ""Total Recall"" superior to the Arnie model? For starters theres an actual actor in the starring role. As Quaid Farrell displays an ever-evolving combination of bewilderment terror and uber-confidence as a man with no idea how he learned to handle ammunition yet capable of firing guns while doing an action-hero gymnastic routine. He brings realism to a hyper-real situation something that eluded Schwarzenegger the first time around. The futuristic gadgets and gewgaws we gawked at two decades ago also get fresh fun updates cell phones that can be implanted in human hands (try enforcing hands-free laws in that environment local governments); currency featuring President Obamas face; and The Fall a gravity-twisting carnival ride version of a transit system that stands as the films most compelling special-effects achievement. Still this ""Recall"" has more than its share of flaws. Director Len Wiseman tosses in enough distracting lens flares to rival the frequent blue-light flashes in J.J. Abramss 2009 ""Star Trek."" (""I wonder who that actor is. Maybe I could tell if that lens flare would get out of the way ."") And given the serious questions raised by Dicks story -- among them is the truth something undeniable and empirical or just what our brains tell us? -- it would be nice if ""Total Recall"" had attempted to engage on an intellectual level. The most we get is a meaty monologue delivered by Bill Nighy as anti-Cohaagen revolutionary leader Matthias ""The past is a construct of the mind . . . but the heart wants to live in the present"" he says. Ah but perhaps one day a movie version of Dicks story will go deeper. After all this film will soon become the past too. And in 20 years our hearts -- and the hearts of Sony executives -- may again want to live in the present with yet another ""Recall"" remake.Contains intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action some sexual content brief nudity and language.

"Total Recall insists you wont believe it Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview Total Recall insists you wont believe itTotal Recall has a believable lead in Colin Farrell but the rest of it though fun at times can be too much to take. Kate Beckinsale Jessica Biel costar.August 02 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Colin Farrell stars in ""Total Recall."" (Michael Gibson Columbia...)Like a drug that starts with a rush and ends with a headache""Total Recall""is too much of a good thing.Though this film shares the same title as the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie 2012s ""Total Recall"" is not exactly a remake or even a reboot. Both films were inspired by the playfulPhilip K. Dick short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" and some things are carried over from the first film to this one.But as directed by Len Wiseman from a screenplay and screen story credited to five different writers this ""Total Recall"" plays more like a pop-culture mash-up. It adds elements from""Blade Runner""and""Inception""(as well as a dash of ""The Bourne Identity"") to the ""Recall"" cosmos and takes off like a shot. The fun is fun while it lasts it just doesnt last long enough.VIDEO At Total Recall premiere Colin Farrell embraces the momentBack we go to a futuristic world where a company called Rekall turns dreams and fantasies into memories. Our initially bedraggled protagonist Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) discovers that a) he is not at all the person he thinks he is and b) two beautiful women (Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel) know all about it.Wiseman best known for the ""Underworld"" vampire movies is especially good at making on-screen action really active. Snappily edited by Christian Wagner and photographed by Paul Cameron this ""Total Recall"" is in permanent chase mode never slowing down to catch its breath or leave anyone the leisure to think too hard about the tenuous plausibility of what theyre seeing.Not surprising for a director who (like Ridley Scott) began his career in the art department Wiseman has invested a lot of time and energy plus a chunk of the films 125-million budget in the stylish and atmospheric look of not one but two different future worlds.STORY Total Recall will fight Dark Knight Rises for No. 1As an opening crawl informs us we are at the end of the 21st century. A global chemical war has made most of the Earth uninhabitable with the only livable areas being the United Federation of Britain and the Colony a large island that looks suspiciously like Australia.The Colony very much lives up to its name serving as a source of cheap labor for the toffs who run the UFB led by the all-powerful Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston). Because this is the future workers from the Colony can commute daily to the UFB via an enormous elevator-type apparatus called the Fall that hurtles right through the center of the Earth. Imagine that.Both worlds are painstakingly imagined by expert production designer Patrick Tatopoulos. While the UFB is a grand and enormous place created with the help of a proprietary computer model the Colony is a grungy Asian-influenced cityscape heavy on neon and rain that owes a major debt to the work that Scott production designer Lawrence G. Paull and art director David Snyder did on the classic ""Blade Runner.""""Total Recall"" is also fortunate to have the underutilized Farrell as its star. He can handle the films action demands and his gift for looking worried regretful and fully human brings a welcome taste of the real world to the proceedings.Quaid is a migrant assembly line worker married to the beautiful Lori (Beckinsale) but still disenchanted with his life. Rather than being attracted to the workers resistance movement led by Matthias (Bill Nighy) he decides to get some exciting memories implanted by the helpful folks at Rekall.But Quaids innocent notion that it might be fun to imagine being a secret agent turns everything in his world upside down. His wife may not be who he thinks she is. What is he to make of the fetching and somehow familiar Melina (Biel)? And for heavens sake why do people insist on telling him ""Anything you think you know its not true""?With Wiseman and company operating at full gallop ""Total Recall"" starts out fast-moving and imaginative but (as written by Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback from a story by Ronald Shusett amp; Dan OBannon and Jon Povill and Wimmer) its relentless action and its ""is it live or is it Memorex"" concerns about what is real and what is not eventually wear you out.After too many hard-to-follow chases out windows and doors and up and down ultramodern elevator shafts after too many people saying things like ""this is going to sound crazy"" ""Jesus Christ its hard to believe"" and ""youve got to be kidding me"" our systems end up on overload. And there is nothing very futuristic a or entertaining a about that.kenneth.turanlatimes.com----------------------------------Total RecallMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action some sexual content brief nudity and languageRunning time 1 hour 58 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTotal Recall How will the remake stack up?

He plays it with a bit too much wide-eyed confusion however amid his many leaps and falls from buildings and en masse smackdowns. His nemesis Lori played by Kate Beckinsale spends much of the movie strutting down hallways and looking relentlessly though blandly nasty. Theres some hand-to-hand combat between them but its more frenetic than compelling.Jessica Biel is the anti-Beckinsale -- almost as bland but good-hearted and on Farrells side. STORY Beckinsale and Biel recall making Total RecallMORE New faces aim to put their stamp on franchise filmsVIDEO Bryan Cranston teases his Recall villainThe production design is a highlight of this post-apocalyptic tale but the interiors stand out more than the obviously computer-generated cityscapes.The films first third draws us in with an intriguing setup that doesnt deliver on its promise.Farrell is Douglas Quaid an assembly-line worker who goes into a mysterious underworld dive called Rekall for a recreational chemical implant to create fantasy memories to rev up his dull existence.About the movieTotal Recall out of fourStars Colin Farrell Kate Beckinsale Jessica Biel Bryan Cranston Bill Nighy John Cho Director Len WisemanDistributor Sony Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action some sexual content brief nudity and language Running time 2 hours 1 minute Opens Friday nationwideWhat he gets is far more than he bargained for in the deaths of 20 police officials who look as if they stepped out of a Star Wars movie. In a paranoid frenzy he learns that his factory worker persona is fake -- the result of implanted memories -- and that his real identity as a secret agent has been replaced. Or has it? Hes summoned into a hovering car by Biels Melina and the subsequent scene is the best of the too-numerous-to-count chases since its something new with hover cars moving up down and sideways and riding above and below roads.Once Douglas and Melina are on the run from evil forces the story devolves into tedium rather than building excitement.Enjoy five clips from Total RecallThere is some cool high-tech gadgetry such as phone equipment implanted in the palms of hands and a rocketing commuter elevator that travels from one continent to another through the Earths core. Based on Philip K. Dicks dystopian short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale the film has Douglas becoming involved with resistance fighters led by Mathias (Bill Nighy) and taking on the nefarious overlord Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston).Paul Verhoevens R-rated original involved Martians facing off against those who held them in tyranny. It also engaged in more mystery surrounding what was reality and what was implanted memory.This humorless PG-13 remake directed by Len Wiseman (Underworld) is less of a mindbender. It takes place on a bleakly stylized Earth with a pair of mega-continents facing off. Mired in hectic repetitive-looking special effects it doesnt dazzle as much as look like a big-screen video game. The key question takes a back seat to the relentless action sequences Is Douglas suffering from a paranoid delusion or was his memory replaced by nefarious forces? A tensely compelling scene involves a standoff with Douglas work pal Harry (Bokeem Woodbine) who claims hes been injected into Douglas memories to jolt him out of his delusion. Instead of drawing the audience in the action scenes merely blur together. And the intriguing thoughtful concepts at the storys core are glossed over.Total Recall is another remake that didnt need to be made.

Columbia Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Aug. 3 2012 426 p.m. ET As you may recall or even Rekall the troubled hero of the original ""Total Recall"" played by Arnold Schwarzenegger goes to a brain-bending establishment called Rekall Inc. to buy a virtual vacation one thats all in the mind. Now its Colin Farrell who goes to the same company where hes told in the same spirit of dangerously genial salesmanship ""Well provide you with a complete set of memories all your own."" For those of us who saw the original the problem with watching this totally dehumanized remake which was directed by Len Wiseman is that we too have a set of memories all our own specific memories of the 1990 movie--which was clever and playful as well as exciting and hugely impactful--and general memories of a time when going to see an action adventure could be giddy fun. Colin Farrell Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel star in the remake of sci-fi action flick ""Total Recall."" Video courtesy of Sony Pictures. The first question posed by the new production is why. The original directed by Paul Verhoeven was a sci-fi classic and a terrific piece of filmmaking for its time so why try to top it? Thats easy. Remakes arent supposed to top originals or even to match them. Theyre meant to draw new revenues from new audiences; most of the people wholl pay to see this film werent born when the first one came out or if they were they didnt know Arnold from Elmo. Another question is harder but maybe more instructive to answer What does this film say about the state of the movie business? The basic plot has been retained. (So has the hooker who flashes her three breasts in case you were wondering.) After something goes horribly wrong during the memory-implant session the hero Douglas Quaid finds himself caught up in an epic battle he doesnt understand at first and struggles to figure out who he really is. Unlike the original which was set in the future both on Earth and on a Mars thats either real or a dream the new one takes place entirely on an Earth thats staggering under the load of overpopulation and really bad weather--""Blade Runner"" meets Malthus. The main locales are the United Federation of Britain where the upper classes live and the dystopian precincts of the Colony which could have passed in our time for Australia. The two regions are connected by a giant elevator that makes the trip--through the center of the Earth--in 17 minutes if Im not mistaken; if I am its still a big whoosh. To give the new version its due the visuals are great especially if youre partial to oppressiveness a Londonesque megalopolis thrust skyward in a jumble of shifting platforms and seemingly infinite tiers; a spectacular--though also interminable--hover-car chase; multilevel leaps preposterous crash landings soulless interior spaces that make Hong Kongs malls seem warm and cozy by comparison. (The production was designed by Patrick Tatopoulos and photographed by Paul Cameron.) Yet its often hard to tell where the story is playing out--with one whoosh were down in the Colony with another were up in ex-Britain though all of the corridors and tunnels look the same. After a while it doesnt matter since the action is as repetitive as it is relentless a succession of fights and frantic chases accompanied by those drums that have come to define the genre--pacemakers for heartless thrillers. ENLARGE Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg in Celeste and Jesse Forever. Sony Pictures Classics Its equally hard to evince any concern for the hero. ""If Im not me then who the hell am I?"" he asks anxiously but his dilemma doesnt much matter since hes no more a full-fleshed character than the hordes of robocops chasing after him. Thats no knock on Mr. Farrell whos a marvelous screen presence in the right circumstances--as the hapless hit man of ""In Bruges"" for example--and who invests these action sequences with formidable energy. Hes simply stuck within the confines of a mechanistic script along with Kate Beckinsale as Quaids wife and Jessica Biel as the other woman in his wild adventures; both of them work hard for their salary too. The original ""Total Recall"" was built from bottom to top as a vehicle for certified stars. Mr. Schwarzenegger filled the bill and then some; so did Sharon Stone in the role of the wife. Audiences cared about them going in and the movie capitalized on their presence with sexy riffs smart jokes (including some crude but shrewd ones about Arnolds physique) a few whiffs of silliness a sprinkling of grace notes to punctuate the thundering action. The remake has no grace notes or grace no nuance no humanity no character quirks no surprises in the dialogue and no humor apart from one moment when the hero displays a very special kind of phone and an awestruck kid says ""Where do I get one of those?"" Yet these deficits dont matter either at least not to the movies intended audience because--getting back to that earlier question--the state of the movie business has been transformed by globalization. Foreign sales are now where the main action is. We may wonder why so many studio movies these days seem to have been struck from the same crude mold but in many cases including this one they werent made for us as much as for an international market where moviegoers respond more reliably to action and the bedazzlements of production design than to character or dialogue let alone to humor which translates chancily if at all into other languages. In that context the new ""Total Recall"" is not only instructive but possessed of a perverse purity. Almost everything but the action has been distilled out. Celeste and Jesse Forever ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" follows a couple trying to have a perfect breakup after ten years of marriage. The film stars Andy Samberg and Rashida Jones who wrote the film with Will McCormack. Video Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. After a decade or so of imperfect marriage Celeste (Rashida Jones who wrote the film with Will McCormack) and Jesse (Andy Samberg) are trying to achieve a perfect breakup--one that will sever their marital bonds while preserving the friendship thats still precious to them. Its an interesting premise and they have lots to say about it but the more these two likable people rattled on the more I found myself thinking about the elusive distinction between characters talking genuinely smart talk and simply chattering for the camera. These actors are appealing too Ms. Jones is best known for her role as Ann Perkins on ""Parks and Recreation"" and Mr. Samberg for his comedic chops on ""Saturday Night Live."" And its not as if ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" which was directed by Lee Toland Krieger lacks for issues or at least for talk of issues. Shes an accomplished hard-charging media consultant who has written a book about contemporary trends called ""Shitegeist"" hes a sweet-spirited slacker who doesnt have a bank account. But the camera stays too close while they generate clouds of talk with no respite from cleverness about everything from relationships to yoga Pilates vegan cuisine the Beijing Olympics and pay-per-view porn in Cantonese. ""American culture is dying"" Celeste declares on a TV show. The movie which plays like a Facebook page suggests only that American culture is choking on data overload. ENLARGE DVD Focus Long before he directed the original ""Total Recall"" Paul Verhoeven made small superb features in his native Holland. Unfortunately the best of them--""Soldier of Orange"" and ""Keetje Tippel""--arent available in this country on commercial DVD. (Dont be tempted by the fuzzy grotesquely dubbed version of the latter retitled ""Katies Passion"" on Amazons streaming service.) Here though are three of his later films. Black Book (2006) Carice van Houten is Rachel Stein a former cabaret singer who because shes Jewish has been living in a hidden room with a gentile family in rural Holland during World War II. Once Rachel is forced to leave her hiding place she dyes her hair starts calling herself Ellis de Vries and attains as a Resistance fighter a level of erotically infused heroism usually reserved for mainstream action thrillers. The Nazi officer Rachel falls for is played magnetically by Sebastian Koch who was the East German writer in ""The Lives of Others."" RoboCop (1987) Another of Mr. Verhoevens sci-fi classics this one stars Peter Weller as a good cop in a bad crime-ridden town--a not-so-futuristic Detroit--who gets blown apart then put back together as a cyborg called RoboCop. The film which was influential far beyond the not-so-hot sequels it spawned is violent lurid thoughtful satirical and mercilessly suspenseful. The director worked from a script by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. The cast includes Nancy Allen Dan OHerlihy Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith. Starship Troopers (1997) War is a new kind of hell when bright-eyed earthlings take on the arachnid hordes in this adaptation of Robert A. Heinleins 1959 sci-fi novel. The book was heavy on polemics equating military service with moral virtue and civic responsibility. At first the movie takes an ironic stance toward Mr. Heinleins angry militarism with beautiful kids as blissed-out cannon fodder. But the violent action and exuberant humor eventually obliterate any traces of irony in this vast elegantly executed enterprise. The cast directed in a studiedly impersonal style includes Casper Van Dien Dina Meyer Denise Richards Jake Busey and Neil Patrick Harris.

But its script credited to six authors is more like a preliminary sketch. Directed by Underworld franchise veteran Len Wiseman the movie retains some elements of Paul Verhoevens friskier (and more graphically violent) 1990 original. Yet it also makes lots of changes notably by downplaying the brain-bending aspects of the scenario in favor of thought-free action. (Also it never leaves a devastated Earth for Mars.) Our hero (Colin Farrell) might be Doug an assembly-line worker who lives in the Colony which used to be called Australia. He commutes daily -- right through the earths core no less -- to the only other inhabited part of the planet a neo-colonialist Britain. Talk about the perils of outsourcing When hes awake Doug is content with his life as well as his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale another Underworld franchise veteran and Wisemans spouse). In his recurring dreams however Doug is another man altogether. There he travels with another woman who is eventually revealed to be Melina (Jessica Biel). So Doug goes to Rekall a company that implants recreational false memories in its customers in the hope of discovering the basis for his nightly reveries. Rather then being modernistic the companys offices look like an upscale Chinese opium parlor. This is a joke that like much of the movies depiction of the Colony teeters on the verge of being an ethnic slur. Although its whats left of Australia after a devastating global war the Colony has a strong Asian character. (In one version of the script reportedly it was dubbed ""New Shanghai."") The signs are mostly in Chinese -- English Korean Russian and Japanese can also be glimpsed -- and the rainy weather and teeming tenements suggest 1960s Hong Kong only with more hookers and robot cops. The other thing the Colony resembles is the L.A. of Ridley Scotts Blade Runner another vision of a decrepit Asian-ized future. (Both that film and this one are loosely derived from Philip K. Dicks fiction.) But where Blade Runner had a unified sensibility the new Total Recall is a series of set pieces whose CGI environments trump narrative logic. The multidirectional transportation systems of the movies neo-London for one offer many opportunities for chase and battle scenes but otherwise make no sense. i Lori (Kate Beckinsale) and Vilos (Bryan Cranston) are two enemies that come to light after Quaid visits Rekall. Michael Gibson/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Michael Gibson/Columbia Pictures Lori (Kate Beckinsale) and Vilos (Bryan Cranston) are two enemies that come to light after Quaid visits Rekall. Michael Gibson/Columbia Pictures Eventually Doug learns that he may actually be Hauser a double agent torn between a genocidal colonial overlord (Bryan Cranston) and a revolutionary leader (Bill Nighy) whos either a terrorist or a great liberator. Nighy passes through the story with barely a hiccup while Cranston and Beckinsale are given more to do. This is a movie that loves its villains and is reluctant to bid them farewell. (Its almost as if Beckinsale is still playing one of Underworlds undead.) The original movie was of course a vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger not exactly a versatile performer. Yet that movie was slyer than this remake which doesnt make much use of its stars superior acting chops. In one scene Farrell does pretend to play a little Beethoven. But mostly he just runs jumps and shoots. During a brief reflective moment one character tells Doug that ""the past is a construct of the mind."" Then a bunch of white-armored storm troopers smash their way in reminding us that this Total Recall was constructed mostly to bypass the mind altogether.

Then hes chased by a bunch of guys with guns gets in a kick-boxing head-whomping throwdown with his wife wrinkles his brow in a furious effort to get a grip on reality and wonders ""If Im not me then who am I?"" More about Total Recall >> At least I think I remember this. It could just be a memory implant from the last time I dropped into Rekall Inc. A reboot of Paul Verhoevens 1990 futuro-thriller with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the factory schmo who gets his mind messed with (and Sharon Stone as the missus and Rachel Ticotin as the other woman) the new Total Recall comes by way of director Len Wiseman who casts his Underworld leading lady Kate Beckinsale as the wife and Colin Farrell - that master of the befuddled eyebrow twitch - as Doug Quaid the is-this-real-or-is-this-memory hero. Jessica Biel rounds out the menage. Both Total Recalls owe their origins to the prolific paranoiac scribe Philip K. Dick whose 1966 short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" introduced the Kafka-esque conceit. Wisemans Total Recall also owes plenty to Blade Runner (also based on a Dick story) The neon-streaked noodle-shop squalor of the towering dystopian enclave that Farrells Quaid wanders around looks like its just a hover-cab ride away from where Harrison Fords Rick Deckard lived in Ridley Scotts landmark science-fiction noir. If The Fifth Element comes to mind while watching Wisemans efficient action-packed retake well yup those floating cars and multitiered M.C. Escher cityscapes sure seem familiar. Theres no trip to Mars in this Total Recall. Its the late 21st century the world has been apocalypsized by chemical warfare and the sole surviving clumps of civilization are the United Federation of Britain (yes Londoners still buoyed by their success at the 2012 Olympics) and the Colony which is what we know as Australia. To travel between the two spots one takes the Fall - a train that rockets straight through Earths core. Quaids daily commute gives him just enough time to read a few pages of Ian Flemings The Spy Who Loved Me. (Anachronism alert Hes got a 60s-vintage paperback) Quaid is an espionage buff so when a coworker tells him about the fun he can have at Rekall he opts for the secret agent package. Next thing you know hes shooting at platoons of robot police (second cousins to the stormtroopers of Star Wars) and lost in a mind-tripping maze of intrigue. Biel stoic and statuesque plays the rebel fighter Melina and serves as Quaids tour guide. Shes plotting to depose the Federations despotic chancellor (Bryan Cranston). Can Quaid trust her? Can he trust himself? Strip away the video-game visual effects the endless chases and zero gravity shootouts and Total Recall comes down to this What is reality? And in which reality with which woman - Beckinsale or Biel - do you want to live? This is a truly an existential dilemma. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Bryan Cranston Colin Farrell Jessica Biel Kate Beckinsale Movies Science Fiction and Fantasy Thrillers total recall Entertainment News Colin Farrell in ""Total Recal"" The original Arnold Schwarzenegger ""Total Recall"" from 1990 - and lets admit that applying the word ""original"" to any Schwarzenegger movie especially that one feels weird - marked the apogee of director Paul Verhoevens meteoric Hollywood career. I still think film history will vindicate Verhoeven as a singular and important figure who bridged the gap between 1970s European art-house film and big-budget spectacle cinema. (You can find my now-ancient essay in defense of Verhoevens oeuvre and significance here.) A dedicated ironist and formalist whose work always has a dark Freudian undercurrent Verhoeven was following in the footsteps of Alfred Hitchcock and Brian De Palma but just as clearly paving the way for Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder.After sending Schwarzenegger to Mars in his loose adaptation of Philip K. Dicks short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" Verhoeven scandalized the world with Sharon Stones crotch in the supposedly shocking ""Basic Instinct"" (that seems almost charming today) - an even bigger hit and an outstanding psychological thriller that continues to reward repeat viewings even as a period piece. Then came ""Showgirls"" and ""Starship Troopers"" arguably his most memorable and influential films although both were considered big flops on initial release and after that his American career hit the skids. (Now 74 years old and back in Amsterdam Verhoeven is still trying to launch his long-contemplated ""Jesus of Nazareth"" a project I both dread and long for.)Hollywood now appears to be scouring Verhoeven from its collective memory after the fashion of the Soviet encyclopedia - or after the fashion of ""Total Recall"" now that you mention it. First comes this muscular remake of ""Total Recall"" from ""Underworld"" director Len Wiseman which I would describe as a serviceable summer action thriller with great production design and a monotonous level of pyrotechnics. Next well see a 2013 ""RoboCop"" reboot from Brazilian director Jose Padilha of the ""Elite Squad"" series which certainly sounds promising on its own terms and after that Sony and producer Toby Jaffe are reportedly planning a new ""Starship Troopers"" with beefed-up CGI effects and a script from the writers of ""X-Men First Class.""Im not claiming theres some ideological attempt to erase Verhoevens sardonic sexually ambivalent satires from the public imagination; the ideology of Hollywood studios is entirely based on nine-digit numerals. But the effect nonetheless will be to shove Verhoeven further back into history and to make his versions of these movies appear secondary to most if not all younger viewers. Now theres nothing disgraceful about Wisemans ""Total Recall"" which conjures up a marvelously detailed post-apocalyptic ""Blade Runner""-style future in which chemical warfare has poisoned most of the globe and all of humanity is jammed into a few uncontaminated corners mainly the United Federation of Britain in northwestern Europe and ""The Colony"" formerly known as Australia. Workers from the Colony travel back and forth to London via one of this movies coolest inventions a rocket-propelled spaceship-elevator thingy called the Fall that travels straight through the Earths core to the other side in 17 minutes with gravity reversing en route.Only the super-rich can get off this diseased planet apparently although the Rekall technician played by John Cho suggests that to factory worker Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell) as a possible implanted memory. ""Id like to go to Mars"" Doug muses and I guess that counts as an in-joke. (The convoluted writing credits list a screenplay by Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback and a story by Wimmer Ronald Shusett Dan OBannon and Jon Povill the latter three of whom worked on the Verhoeven film.) Doug assembles robot soldiers for the UFBs quasi-totalitarian regime all day and then heads back to the Colony at night to guzzle beer snuggle up with his remarkably hot wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) and experience some puzzling action-movie dreams. As you already know if youve encountered any previous version of this story Doug may not be who he thinks he is and his trip to Rekall for a psychotropic vacation yields unexpected results (or ahem at least appears to). You Might Also Like As in the ""Underworld"" pictures Wiseman doesnt waste much time on plot exposition or character development. As soon as Doug visits Rekall and either is or is not injected with Secret Agent serum - learning that he either is or is not a secret agent in ""real life"" whatever that is -- all hell breaks loose. He takes down a whole posse of Stormtrooper-looking cybercops and then must engage in a major kickass battle with Lori who suddenly has an English accent and serious martial-arts skills followed by an extended chase sequence through their cantilevered vertical city that resembles parkour crossed with Tetris. This ""Total Recall"" offers clean athletic performances from a troika of indubitably attractive B-plus stars with Farrell and Beckinsale joined later by Jessica Biel as a comely resistance fighter who has both personal and political reasons for trying to reboot Dougs buried secret identity (or implanted fake double-agent identity or - crap Im not really sure). ""Breaking Bad"" star Bryan Cranston is also on hand in a limited villainous role as the dastardly Chancellor Cohaagen military ruler of the UFB. Im not sure this movie or this role are distinctive enough to return Farrell to the top level of Hollywood stardom which he left behind for various rumored or real reasons after playing Sonny Crockett in Michael Manns 2006 ""Miami Vice."" (Or was the existence of that movie a fiction implanted in my memory?) Still he would do well to match the trajectory and stability of Beckinsale (Wisemans real-life spouse) who has parlayed her lean physique spectacular hair and perennially pissed-off expression into an improbable action-star career. Making allowances for the fact that its August and youre likely to see this movie with a sunburn and an unstable combination of beer and ice cream in your tummy ""Total Recall"" is a doggone good time with a bunch of nifty technical and visual flourishes competently managed plot twists and elegant Wachowski-esque action choreography that eventually becomes deadening because theres just too much of it and its dialed up too high.Im not saying that Wisemans ""Total Recall"" compares to the Verhoeven film on a thematic or imaginative or philosophical level (pretentious I know) because it doesnt. Of course whats technically possible to put on-screen today far outstrips what Verhoeven could do with the cutting edge of 1990. But CGI does not equal visual sensibility and the way Verhoeven uses light and framing and editing - the way every shot serves to establish an unknown world and advance the themes and satirical framework of the story - is subtly but distinctly superior. Still its a relief to report that Wiseman has made his own movie one that invents its own grim version of the human future (and comes marginally closer to Dicks original story) and doesnt try to rinse the original from our brains.

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Too bad they retained the title of ""Total Recall"" and ditched every quality that made that 1990 sci-fi smash memorable. Gone is the saber-sharp satire the irresistibly quippy and quotable dialogue and the agreeably cheesy over-amped performances. What remains is a total retread of a popcorn classic made shinier louder and crushingly dumber. In a grim overpopulated future Colin Farrell plays factory worker Doug Quaid one of those faceless people who makes things work but never gets his due. After another dispiriting day on the assembly line stamping out robocops (this film positively bristles with allusions to top science-fiction movies) hes ready for a bit of escapism. Traveling through the labyrinthine slums that entrap him before the plot complications do he visits Rekall Inc. a shady memory-implantation center where customers can experience the delusion of their choice. Quaid has barely begun his secret-agent fantasy when SWAT troopers burst in and Quaid reacts superspy-style shooting the police squad full of holes. Now his wife (Kate Beckinsale) is out to kill him and a strangely familiar woman (Jessica Biel) entices him with information about his true identity. Or so it seems. Is Quaid a nobody dreaming of glory or an undercover agent whose memory is gradually returning? Farrells charisma and acting skill are untapped in a routine action role. Beckinsale brings a virulent edge to her one-note character with Biel providing a serviceable good-girl counterweight. Bryan Cranston as the chief villain doesnt seem cunning enough to pull the strings on a globe-spanning conspiracy. The person he keeps sending to eliminate Quaid proves time after time incapable of getting the job done the sort of detail youd expect a mastermind to notice. Paul Verhoevens brutal lewd but clever original gave viewers two sources of entertainment. They could puzzle their way through Quaids existential dilemma or revel in the splattery knowingly ludicrous violence. Verhoeven was audacious enough to shear off a bad guys forearms and talented enough to make it work as an outlandish sight gag. Len Wiseman the guiding light behind the ""Underworld"" vampires vs. werewolves thrillers is a proficient action director nothing more. He delivers dystopian cityscapes as good as any ever seen onscreen and slickly edited fight-and-flight scenes. Theres plenty to excite the eye but the mind remains unboggled. Its all visuals and no vision. You wont need Rekall Inc. to erase this movie from your memory as it will evaporate quickly on its own.

"Total Recall (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Total Recall (PG-13) This redundant remake of the 1990 cult classic manages to make Colin Farrell boring. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com8/2/2012 Editor rating 1 If humankind ever develops the technology to erase our memories the way it does in Total Recall Ill happily pay to wipe out any number of errors in past judgment including that Rush concert I went to and all the blue eye shadow I wore back in the 80s. The technicians should also feel free to root through my hippocampus to eliminate any recollection of the last decade or so of Miami Dolphins drafts and while theyre at it they can remove all traces of the reboot of Total Recall. Because theres absolutely no reason to remember it. The first Total Recall was not exactly Blade Runner though both films are based on the work of Philip K. Dick (in this case the story We Can Remember It For You Wholesale). Directed by Paul Verhoeven the original movie is chiefly remembered for Arnold Schwarzeneggers goofy trademark one-liners (""Consider that a divorce."") a now-hilariously cheesy special effect of a disguise going awry at a security checkpoint and a brief yet intriguing appearance of a mutant woman with three breasts about whom middle-aged guys are still talking on Facebook. You know who you are. Still any thriller about hidden realities and secret spies and three-breasted mutants is fair game for a remake especially considering the advances in CGI since the original movie was made (it was released in 1990). Marc Webb updated The Amazing Spider-Man in refreshing ways after all. But the new Total Recall fails on the most basic levels Its characters are dull and its action is duller. Directed by Len Wiseman (Live Free or Die Hard Underworld) the movie creates a futuristic world full of intriguing possibilities -- and then forgets to populate it with anyone interesting. Nor do the writers ever come up with anything unique for these painfully flat characters to do. In this version they dont even get to go to Mars. Of all its crimes then this is the worst making Colin Farrell boring. Doesnt seem possible and yet. Farrell stars as Douglas Quade a drone of a worker trudging through a dank dystopian landscape. Through a tired parade of TV newscasts we learn there is some sort of turmoil afoot and that it involves a rebel named Matthias (Bill Nighy) squaring off with the powerful leader Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston). None of this bothers Quade though. Instead hes plagued by odd nightmares that involve a mysterious woman (Jessica Biel) and a nagging sense of dissatisfaction with his job building robots on an assembly line. Not even his hot wife (Kate Beckinsale) can pull him out of his funk. Then Quade spots an escape albeit a temporary one He sees ads from a company named Rekall that promise to implant thrilling memories into its clients. He ventures into the business gets himself strapped to a chair and one lengthy shootout later learns hes not who he thinks he is -- and neither is anyone else he knows. After that discovery there is a lot of running and chasing and fighting in Total Recall but differentiating one action scene from another is hard work. Transformers boasts more memorable setpieces (also Bumblebee may have had a more fleshed-out character arc). The postapocalyptic landscape presents some potential but the filmmakers rarely seem to take advantage of it preferring to go the familiar car chase route in one instance (the fact that the cars are flying barely registers). The hand-to-hand combat scenes share a dismal sameness too whether Quade is getting beat up by his traitorous wife or battling the evil Cohaagen. The Emmy-winning Cranston by the way emerges from this mess in the best shape; hes still got another half season left playing a truly treacherous villain in Breaking Bad so he can afford this folly. The film features a few nice technical updates in particular the transmitter that turns characters hands into a phone and a zero-gravity fight scene is briefly arresting. But it comes too late in the film to make much of an impact. A movie like Total Recall should above all else be fun. Instead its just one more thing to forget.

(Michael Gibson/AP) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday August 2 2012 255 PM Title Total Recall Film Info PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. Theres something sadly poetic about a movie dealing with disappearing memories that vanishes from your mind while you watch it. Yet thats the only memorable thing about ""Total Recall"" a remake of a schlocky 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle that like this new version was based on a 1960s Philip K. Dick short story. Where that previous film had cartoonish effects and a Mars-set conclusion this new one is filled with future-industrial grit and ""Blade Runner""-esque squalor. Yet nothing sticks. Colin Farrell is Quaid an industrial worker at the end of the 21st century when chemical warfare has made most of Earth unlivable. Whats left is the ""United Federation of Britain"" -- where the ruling class resides -- and the Colony a pan-Asian continent teeming with despair dissatisfaction and apparently every paper lantern ever created. (Theres decadence too though the three-breasted streetwalker in this version only gets a second of screen time per bosom.) Quaid and his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) dream of escape so Quaid tries to buy himself some at a company called Rekall which puts fake experiences in peoples minds so they can forget theyre just peons. Yet Quaids head trip opens up a memory he wasnt aware of His previous identity as a resistance fighter. He was aligned with a mysterious underground leader (Bill Nighy here and gone all in one scene) and in love with a fellow rebel (Jessica Biel). But he must stay ignorant of it all because there are double-agent twists to his real-life tale. As he digs up who he was his government operative wife Lori tries to kill him. Director Len Wiseman (""Underworld"" ""Live Free or Die Hard"") makes the wanna-be ""Matrix"" conceit more muddled by not establishing rules within this sci-fi universe. So when Quaid must escape from ""synthetic"" worker-guards who answer to an evil overlord (Bryan Cranston doing serious hairpiece acting) he steals an inter-Earth subway easily. In another scene Colony refugees just tumble out of a plane and onto English streets. Beckinsale stalking into rooms like shes ready for a Vogue shoot is as undeterred in her mission to kill as the Terminator. Though she and Farrell are the most attractive future drones ever he in particular has more serious acting chops than ""Recall"" requires so he goes on autopilot for much of the film. Facing off against the action-babe automaton Beckinsale (director Wisemans real-life wife) Biel barely has time to make an impression Screenwriters Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback -- each responsible for writing some solid action flicks -- run out the clock with uninspired chase scenes and made-to-order attitude. Whats missing is actual personality and a reason to remember why we wound up here in the first place.

The only laugh to be had in ""Total Recall"" a ripsnorting sci-fi action extravaganza that starts well and works its way down to average is in the opening credits where we learn that the movies primary production company is called Original Film. Really? Youre giving us a remake of a 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger hit which itself was based on a 1966 short story by the visionary dystopian Philip K. Dick and thats what you want to lead with?Truth be told theres nothing at all original about the new ""Total Recall."" But for the first hour or so you dont mind. Colin Farrell is the films nominal star playing a factory drone named Doug Quaid in a post-apocalyptic near future. Visiting Total Rekall a company that implants fantasy memories -- world domination global fame things like that -- he discovers that his own memories have been erased and hes actually a highly skilled resistance fighter. Schwarzenegger played the role with his usual mix of quips and brawn but Farrell wants to get closer to the core idea of a normal schmo who realizes hes not so normal. That approach might bear fruit if the movie slowed down long enough to let it. But director Len Wiseman -- hes responsible for the profitable deeply silly ""Underworld"" series -- has things to blow up and digital worlds to create.The actual stars of this movie are the craftsmen and women assembled by production designer Patrick Tatopoulos who create a late-21st-century society of baroque Asian-accented architectural chaos. The twin states of the United Federation of Britain and the Colony -- what used to be called Australia -- are all thats left after chemical warfare has poisoned the rest of the planet and ""Total Recall"" imagines them as the elitist yin and slummy yang of futuristic rot. The films vision owes everything to 1982s ""Blade Runner"" also based on a story by Dick but that vision has been busted out into an astonishingly detailed three-dimensional chess game. Even with the grimy palette of grays and browns decreed by Hollywoods love affair with computer graphics -- remember when movies had colors? -- this is state-of-the-art stuff.Which is to say that as Farrells Doug Quaid (or who he thinks is ""Doug Quaid"") tears around the two territories pursued by bears -- OK by the synthetic robo-cops who work for dastardly UFB chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston in a tragic blond wig) -- youre seduced by the spaces hes running through more than what hes running from. The movies toys are equally choice glowing cellphones implanted in peoples hands holographic collars that allow the wearer to assume a new face a prolonged chase sequence on the underside of a magnetic highway in the sky. The films characters travel from the Colony to the UFB via the Fall a behemoth shuttle service that passes through the Earths core with a gravity-free zone in the middle. Ridiculous but you cant take your eyes off the screen.Unfortunately theres this little business of a plot. As Doug reacquires his memories hes chased by Lori (Kate Beckinsale) who he thought was his wife and who is revealed to be an implacable agent for Cohaagens police state. In Paul Verhoevens 1990 version Lori was played by Sharon Stone and was dispatched with much glee halfway through. Wiseman keeps the character around for much longer and for good reason Beckinsale is a mesmerizing combination of prettiness and power and shes the films only touch of wit -- its stressed-out Terminatrix. (Not coincidentally shes also Mrs. Wiseman and the star of the ""Underworld"" films.)""Total Recall"" also stars Jessica Biel as Melina Dougs once and future freedom-fighting girlfriend but its a mark of how little the movie cares about actual humans that she and Beckinsale are visually alike enough for a viewer to occasionally have trouble telling them apart. The peerless Bill Nighy turns up briefly as the leader of the rebels but his gentle stoop signals embarrassment more than humility.Where Dicks original story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" bristled with ideas and provocations and Verhoevens film remains pleasurably subversive (its good Schwarzenegger but it probably would have been a better movie without him) Wisemans remake slowly caves in to conventional genre thinking. The last act is a pro forma trudge through ticking grenade countdowns and industrial-strength fireballs and the world is saved once more ho-hum. Even the matter of whether the movie is ultimately Dougs fantasy as he lies dreaming in the Total Rekall offices is fumbled. Theres dramatic ambiguity and then theres mud.In the end heres the worst sin of this slick high-octane memory play Its forgettable.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Since the new Recall is totally witless dont expect laughs. Originality and coherence are also notably MIA. Colin Farrell steps into the Governators role as Doug Quaid a factory worker with a sexy wife (Kate Beckinsale) who cant distract him from daydreaming about a better life than his workday grind building robo-cops. Back in 1990 Doug dreamed of going to Mars. Farrells Doug is stuck on a dystopian Earth all but destroyed except for an elite United Federation of Britain run by the evil Cohaagen (Breaking Bads Bryan Cranston) and The Colony where poor saps like Doug labor to please the one percent. Thats why Doug is tempted to try Rekall a memory-implant that lets him live a fantasy life in his head. Doug picks secret agent and finds out -- guess what? -- that he really is one. This is not a spoiler. The new movie spills the beans at the start killing all suspense. Director Len Wiseman over-compensates with lots of noise and hectic action. Jessica Biel shows up as a love from Dougs past. Biel and Beckinsale trade punches and kicks that look remarkably unconvincing. Wiseman amps up the soundtrack to fool us. Not working. Beckinsale married to Wiseman in real life (theyve worked together on the Underworld films) says ""shit"" a lot as Doug evades her grasp by jumping off countless buildings and through endless rofftops. I said ""shit"" a lot to myself as the movie dragged on interminably wasting its resonant source material Philip K. Dicks short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" with its intriguing psychological subtext the genuine horror in the theft of a mind. This Total Recall will make you feel robbed as well.

Daily Edition Login to download Total Recall Film Review 923 AM PDT 8/2/2012 by Justin Lowe FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Columbia Pictures A re-imagined sci-fi narrative that never quite gains traction despite a game cast and robust visual style. TWITTER Colin Farrell Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel star in director Len Wisemans reimagining of Philip K. Dicks short ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale."" Re-envisioning a classic is frequently a tricky bit of business and Paul Verhoevens 1990 Total Recall starring Arnold Schwarzenegger is something of a touchstone of contemporary science fiction filmmaking. Drawing again from the seminal Philip K. Dick short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale the current version directed by Len Wiseman retains the essentials of the original material but twists the action more toward a futuristic thriller. The outcome is engaging enough though not entirely satisfying from either a genre or narrative standpoint lacking substance and a degree of imagination. Brand recognition along with the curiosity factor and a name cast in muscular action roles should make for a lucrative first weekend but falloff could be somewhat steep in subsequent frames. PHOTOS Total Recall Premiere Following a worldwide chemical war postapocalyptic Earth offers a stark contrast between the only two surviving population centers with the well-off United Federation of Britain (UFB) relying on the cheap labor of the impoverished inhabitants of The Colony to support a massive security force that keeps both regions under the thumb of menacing Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston). Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) appears to be just another working stiff from The Colony who commutes on a massive cross-planetary transport to labor in a UFB factory manufacturing exoskeletons for the Synthetics a robotic security force deployed to suppress the resistance the shadowy rebel movement seeking to topple the UFB. Although hes happy enough with his blue-collar life and loving wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) hes plagued by dreams about a violent past and an unfamiliar woman (Jessica Biel). Since hes already imagining himself to be some sort of secret agent Quaid decides to check out Rekall a company that offers to create realistic memories for customers with the aid of drugs electronics and some powerful psychological constructs. Quaids session goes way wrong almost before it can begin when the initial stage of the Rekall process activates his suppressed personality and alerts the UFB security forces. Federal police descend on Rekall where Quaid kills them all in a shootout while channeling his newly acquired secret-agent skill set. On the run and unable to remember any details from his violent past after discovering that Lori is an undercover UFB operative Quaid follows a series of clues leading him inexorably on a search for resistance leader Matthias (Bill Nighy) and the woman from his dreams. PHOTOS Hollywoods New Leading Ladies Stripping the storyline of the original movies Mars-travel subplot the five credited writers cherry-pick from a selection of sci-fi classics to dress up whats essentially a thriller template with futuristic plot and visual elements. The central narrative concerning a man pursued by mysterious forces with no apparent connection to his present life is familiar from any number of spy thrillers but affords a weak foundation for the current remake. In the plus column screenwriters Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback and production designer Patrick Tatopoulos have devised a fascinating futuristic world with impressively cohesive visual characteristics. In particular the massive transport vessel known as The Fall that makes the daily cross-planetary trip is an intricately conceived setting for much of the films climactic action. Other touches including a freeway with flying cars and an extensive regional elevator system are familiar from other films but make a robust return here. Standing in for Schwarzenegger in the lead role is no small feat and rather than try to emulate Farrells performance emphasizes his speed and acting ability though this is far from one of his better roles. While he succeeds well enough the scripts dearth of character development doesnt give him much to work with. Indeed there are so few pauses in the breathless action that Farrell barely has the chance to develop the romantic subplot with Biels rebel leader Melina before theyre back on the run again. Biel has the less substantial supporting role but enough screen time to flesh out her character as a badass revolutionary determined to both save the world and the man she loves. Reteaming with husband and director Wiseman from the Underworld series Beckinsale is relentless if one-dimensional as the UFB agent assigned to take out Quaid and both women are more than capable in the nearly nonstop combat scenes. Wiseman shows a strong command of the films disparate elements effectively uniting the street-level scenes set in the squalid Colony with the higher-tech chases through the sleek confines of the UFB. Without much backstory to lend the characters Wiseman focuses on highlighting the action sequences and setting them convincingly within the futuristic world. Both the production design and the visual effects supervision by Peter Chiang unite the physical and virtual components to create a seamless landscape while cinematographer Paul Cameron capably encapsulates the films paranoid tone and editor Christian Wagner sets a relentless pace.

(AP Photo/Columbia Pictures - Sony Michael Gibson) Michael Gibson This film image released by Columbia Pictures shows Jessica Biel in a scene from the action thriller ""Total Recall."" (AP Photo/Columbia Pictures - Sony Michael Gibson) ""We are all interested in the future"" said the psychic Criswell in ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" because ""that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.""The most effective science fiction builds a bridge to the present whether with recycled artifacts from our time or a foundation of timeless ideas.In 1990 ""Total Recall"" pondered the nature of reality in an age of technological illusions and political paranoia. The new remake is another serving of brain food but this sensory feast is more memorable for updating the decor of the global-terrorism era than for reheating the action cliches of the Schwarzenegger era. The richly constructed first hour is so superior to any feat of sci-fi speculation since ""Minority Report"" that the bland aftertaste of the chase finale is quickly forgotten. In the original film Arnold Schwarzenegger played an everyman named Douglas Quaid who was troubled by dreams about a slave revolt on Mars. In the remake factory drone Quaid (Colin Farrell) is earthbound and the post-apocalyptic struggle is between the haves in Britain and the have-nots in Australia. Separating them is a contaminated zone that workers traverse in a shuttle. While Quaids peacekeeper wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) is investigating a London bombing attributed to a mysterious rebel named Matthias (Bill Nighy) restless Quaid sneaks off to the vividly imagined vice district for a dose of altered reality.The Rekall corporation promises to implant pleasant memories into its clients and Quaid wants to ""remember"" being a freedom fighter. But it turns out that he already has those memories as if he really were an undercover assassin with amnesia. Suddenly he finds himself thrust into the middle of a guerrilla war against robotic stormtroopers a law-and-order politician Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston) and Quaids own cut-throat wife with no idea how he acquired his deadly skills. Quaids only ally is Melina (Jessica Biel) a Lori look-alike who knew him as a rebel named Hauser before his memory was erased. Many of the combat sequences are inventively choreographed Farrell is brawny but believable and Beckinsale working with director-husband Len Wiseman (""Underworld"") impresses in the role of an unkillable villain. If the last half-hour settles for the mindless overkill of a Reagan-era blockbuster the build-up is such a heady blast that ""Total Recall"" remains a memorable experience.TOTAL RECALLThree and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 158  Content Sci-fi action and violence brief nudity and language Videos Trailer for Total Recall (2012) Aug 1 2012 (...)

Colin Farrell is no Arnold Schwarzenegger and Len Wiseman cant come near to matching Paul Verhoevens 1990 version of the Philip K. Dick science-fiction classic By Richard Corliss Aug. 02 2012 Share Read Later Columbia Pictures Total Recall Year 2012 Director Len Wiseman Studio Columbia Pictures Actors Colin Farrell Kate Beckinsale Jessica Biel Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture In the late 21st century Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) is just a schlemiel on an assembly line that manufactures robot soldiers. He lives in a small apartment in the United Federation of Britain with his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale). Then why are his nights creased with dreams of leading a revolution against the state and trying to save the rebel damsel Melina (Jessica Biel)? The viewer may also wonder why an ordinary factory worker walks around topless sporting a perfectly sculpted torso that looks like its own superhero special effect. Is Quaid really Ryan Reynolds? He seems to have gone to the same trainer. Questions questions nip at Len Wisemans Total Recall like so many rats at the feet of a sleeping hobo. The big why is Why bother? The 1990 movie -- directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Quaid Sharon Stone as Lori and Rachel Ticotin as Melina -- was a very free elaboration of Philip K. Dicks 1966 short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale. The new PG-13 movie is a fairly close adaptation of the Verhoeven one and lacks not just the earlier films newness but also its vigor density humor and R-rated juice. Its like the dinner-theater revival of a classic play whose single asset is to remind those present how good the original was. (MORE Graeme McMillans Tribute to the 1990 Total Recall) Golden-age Hollywood itself an assembly line in the business of manufacturing dreams often produced remakes. Sometimes directors did new takes on their own old films Alfred Hitchcock with The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 and 1956) Leo McCarey with the 1939 Love Affair remade as the 1957 An Affair to Remember. In the old days though movies played their initial run and for the most part disappeared. With no access to a video library and few revival houses viewers consumed movies and consigned them to faulty memory. They were like Quaid at the beginning of Total Recall Did I once see that Hollywood story or only dream it? (MORE Corliss on the Life and Works of Science-Fiction Genius Philip K. Dick) In the 21st century almost every movie is available for viewing; a remake never has the shock of the new -- only a at best fresh take on familiar merchandise. Yet some directors do shot-by-shot remakes of their own films (Michael Hanekes 2007 English-language duplicate of his 1997 Funny Games) or someone elses (Gus Van Sants 1998 clone of the Hitchcock Psycho). Beyond the film-school exercise of a students sketch in the manner of an old master theres the matter of money. Audiences can be counted on to see a remake of a venerable hit rather than some work of startling originality the way children demand to hear a favorite fairy tale for the hundredth time. They dont want to be perplexed by the new; they want to relive the shock of the old. Still there ought to be a reason beyond the opening-weekend gross for a director to spend a year of his life at the cinematic drawing board tracing the contours of a famous movie. Wiseman who birthed the pretty-good quartet of Underworld vampire movies also rejuvenated Bruce Willis Die Hard franchise with the 2007 Live Free or Die Hard. So Wisemans admirers might have expected his version of Total Recall to be truly his -- either by returning faithfully to the Dick story which Verhoeven and his writers had used only as a springboard to their own sturdy fantasies or by leaping in some new uncharted direction. (MORE Corliss Reviews Wisemans Live Free or Die Hard) Just the second big-budget movie (after Blade Runner) to be based on a Dick fiction the Verhoeven Total Recall was a machine of muscles and brains. Reviewing that film on its initial release I wrote ""For its first two-thirds Total Recall has it all the sleek confidence of big-budget picture making at its most inventive. It zaps out beguiling images so quickly that viewers may want to see the film over again right away just to catch what they missed. Verhoeven seems to have assumed that todays moviegoers have a megabyte media intelligence; then he worked like crazy to overload it. When Total Recall is cooking it induces visual vertigo."" (MORE The 1990 Review of Total Recall) Both films spin off Dicks notion that in the near future travel agencies will offer virtual vacations in an alternate world where customers can be whatever they want to be -- business tycoon demon lover an action hero on Mars -- and will remember the experience as if it really happened. ""You cant be this; you cant actually do this"" the travel agent in the Dick story says. ""But you can have been and have done. We see to that."" Dicks cool wrinkle is that his protagonist actually was is a rebel leader named Hauser and that the husband-drone Quaid is a false identity implanted by the state. The writers of the 1990 film (including Dan OBannon and Ronald Shusett who worked on the original Alien) added many other twists which we wont go into here just in case your memory of that movie has been erased. When the new Total Recall changes things its usually by subtraction. Instead of Mars the rebel outpost is now Australia; so the visual contrast in the 1990 film (Mars red Earth silver) is replaced by an allover dull gray. And whereas Stone and Ticotin were the traditional Hollywood polarities of blonde and brunette Beckinsale and Biel are iconically near twins dark-haired and slimly gorgeous. Were not complaining but their similarity underlines the samey look of the whole movie. (MORE McMillan on the Two Total Recalls) The one innovation in the script by Kurt Wimmer (Salt) and Mark Bomback (Unstoppable) is that transport from the UFB to the Colony is not by rocket ship or teleportation but by a 10000-mile-long underground-rail system called the Fall. Note to the writers New York City started digging a Second Avenue subway line five years ago and less than two miles have been completed. At that rate the Fall would be operational by the year 1 million. No question about Beckinsale (a.k.a. Mrs. Len Wiseman) and Biel theyre both smart honeys. The fight scenes involving Beckinsale or her stunt double have a lithe choreography; this Lori is one kick-ass Terminatrix. In the role of the Chancellor of the UFB Bryan Cranston displays a politicians gift for plausible duplicity; he looks and behaves like a perfected android version of Mitt Romney. As for Farrell hes long past his early prime when top directors cast him in important roles Oliver Stones Alexander Michael Manns Miami Vice Terrence Malicks The New World Steven Spielbergs Minority Report (also based on a Dick story). At 36 hes serious intense still handsome impressively bulked up -- the very image but also the clone of an action star without the danger or appeal that defines star quality. (MORE Jess Cagle on Colin Farrells Appeal Back in 2000) Any movie that means to be absolutely faithful to the mood if not the plots of the Philip K. Dick universe would have to climax in terror outrage a possible identity crisis certainly disappointment; there are few happy endings in his fiction. Granted movies are about wish fulfillment not the reinforcement of their audiences feelings of frustration. So dont expect Hollywood to make a film about an ordinary guy who dreams hes a stud warrior and after many adventures wakes up to realize hes been watching his own movie that hes really just a schlemiel a schmendrick a schlub. But we can hope that an adaptation of a Dick tale would possess its own vitality soaring imagination guts -- not a retread of what has been done better elsewhere. What somebody says to Quaid in the ""new"" Total Recall can be applied to the whole movie ""Were gonna have to get you some better dreams.""

Comments click to enlarge Total Recall Video Rated PG-13  118 minutes  2012 Len Wiseman remakes Paul Verhoevens 1990 sci-fi classic which was itself adapted from the Philip K. Dick story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale."" A blue-collar worker in the year 2084 (Collin Farrell) engages the company Rekall to create synthetic memories for him but the memories turn out to be real and he learns that hes part of a massive government conspiracy. Verhoeven used the Dick story as a vehicle for social satire and Baudrillardian meditations on the cinematic image; the new version with its humorless dialogue and Farrells smoldering performance suffers from a self-seriousness that undercuts any genre pleasures. But the action is thrilling and the futuristic setting superbly realized thanks to a proper mix of green-screen sequences and physical sets.

Crazy new gadgets vigorous action sequences and a thorough production-design makeover arent enough to keep ""Total Recall"" from feeling like a near-total redundancy. Scrapping the mayhem-on-Mars angle from Paul Verhoevens 1990 sci-fi shoot-em-up director Len Wisemans Earthbound workmanlike remake sticks Colin Farrell in the Arnold Schwarzenegger role of a government-trained killing machine dealing with one bad case of selective amnesia. The persistence of memory is a funny theme for a picture that seems likely to fade almost immediately from the public consciousness even if it cranks out a decent opening and respectable ancillary. Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bombacks screenplay arrives bearing the weight of multiple story credits citing the first pics scribes as well as Philip K. Dick whose short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" initially inspired this futuristic tale of a brainwashed secret agent trying to figure out who he is and which side hes fighting on. That would be Douglas Quaid (Farrell) introduced awakening from an all-too-vivid nightmare a remnant from a past hes been forced to forget. Chemical warfare has left the Earth uninhabitable except for the Colony (formerly known as Australia) where Quaid lives and a cluster of European nations called the United Federation of Britain. The relationship between these two continents is fraught with tension (probably stemming from a debate over which one is more architecturally indebted to ""Blade Runner"") and the UFBs chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston) is hellbent on squashing an uprising Down Under by a mysterious revolutionary known as Matthias (Bill Nighy). Quaid realizes hes somehow connected to all this sociopolitical turmoil after an ill-fated trip to Rekall a corporation whose artificial memory-implant services bring about several unpleasant revelations. Among these is the fact that his heretofore loving wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) is actually a cold-blooded killer with catlike reflexes and Energizer Bunny-like stamina turning business into a personal grudge as she ruthlessly hunts down Quaid and Melina (Jessica Biel) the great love of his past life. Gone is the first ""Total Recalls"" concept of interplanetary travel; in this version the hottest form of transit is a massive vessel that moves through the Earths core in minutes toggling from one end to the other in one pleasurably gravity-defying sequence. Similarly the pics other highlights are almost exclusively visual The midsection is largely devoted to extended elevated chase sequences involving first the Colonys magnet-powered highway system then a labyrinthine network of criss-crossing elevators that takes Patrick Tatopoulos production design to a mind-bendingly cubist extreme. The future as rendered here is crammed with all kinds of nifty technological wonders from hand-embedded cell phones to identity-concealing neck rings. Wiseman who showed off his action chops to fine effect in 2007s ""Live Free or Die Hard"" takes advantage of the myriad staging possibilities offered up by this elaborate neon-tinged dystopia and he directs the films numerous fight scenes with speed and energy even if those qualities never translate into sustained tension or exhilaration. Strangely theres no psychological underpinning to the violence; the crucial moment when Quaid realizes his superhuman fighting abilities is lensed in show-offy videogame-like fashion with the camera whooshing about the room like a hummingbird having a seizure. Pic is considerably slicker than its predecessor but hardly sleeker at an overlong 117 minutes a fairly dubious accomplishment considering how little it brings to the story in terms of fresh twists and ideas. Above all it lacks the overblown violence and grotesque vulgarity that made Verhoevens vision at once so incorrigible and so vital though Wiseman does tip his hat to the original by throwing in a three-breasted prostitute. Perfs are functional but fine. Absent Schwarzeneggers imposing physicality Farrell plays the role closer to that of a Jason Bourne 5.0 although the actors soft-eyed vulnerability makes sense for a character who finds the rug pulled out from him at every turn. Stepping into a role played in the 1990 pic by Sharon Stone Beckinsale (Wisemans wife whom he directed in the first two ""Underworld"" pics) is pure one-note malevolence though she and Biel make for a nicely matched pair of fierce femmes. Diverse supporting cast boasts an unusual number of Asian faces from John Chos Rekall employee to various extras perhaps as a speculative nod to a rapidly changing global order.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Say as a hypothetical that Paul Verhoevens 1990 thriller Total Recall was an abject failure science fiction for meatheads an egregious violation of Philip K. Dicks short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" anchored to a leaden charmless Arnold Schwarzenegger performance. None of these charges are entirely true--or true enough to be damning--but even viewers who see the original film in the worst possible light will have at least been through an experience. And an excessively violent one too bearing the distinct residue of a pre-CGI era where action movies were about squibs testosterone and giant explosions. Contrast that with the new Total Recall a typically bloodless PG-13 affair that makes no impression whatsoever--and seems designed that way too. The violence is severely muted reduced to a few extended chase sequences some generic Hong Kong-style hand-to-hand and machine-gun battles that have all the impact of a laser-tag session. The hearty proletariats of Verhoevens Mars all mutants and outcasts who work the mines or turn tricks have been replaced by good-looking Earthbound have-nots who live like the Jetsons even in squalor. And the mind-bending question of whether the heros dreams are really memories and which one of his identities is ""true"" are mostly withdrawn in favor of thoughtless spectacle. Its only evident passion is for excessive lens flares. Directed by Len Wiseman who made Live Free Or Die Hard and the first two Underworld movies this Total Recall casts Colin Farrell in the lead role replacing Schwarzeneggers blockhead charisma and canned one-liners with whatever it is that Colin Farrell brings to the table. After chemical warfare made most of the Earth uninhabitable in the late 21st century the only two populated areas are locked in class conflict The elites reside in an area encompassing what was once Great Britain and the wage slaves live in ""The Colony"" a fetid hellhole in the former Australia that looks more like retro-future Shanghai. Farrell plays a factory worker who commutes to Britain on ""The Fall"" a 17-minute rail line that takes a shortcut through the Earths core. Though happily married to Kate Beckinsale Farrell goes through life with a growing feeling of dissatisfaction and continues to be haunted by dreams of far-off spy adventures with another woman. When he hears of Rekall a company that specializes in implanting vivid memories into its clients heads Farrell seeks to crystallize those fantasies. But it turns out that his memory has previously been erased and he really was a secret agent in his former life and he carries a secret that threatens a glowering dictator (Bryan Cranston) who seeks to tighten his grip on global power. Farrell finds an ally in Jessica Biel the woman of his dreams who materializes as a rebel fighter. Total Recall takes a stab at contemporary relevance by positing insurrectionists--and accused terrorists--as heroes in the fight against the rich tyrants who force them to build the service robots that will replace them. But those politics are mere window-dressing for a CGI spectacle thats as much a de facto remake of Blade Runner as an updating of the Verhoeven film. The citizens in Wisemans future live vertically in sleek super-structures get around in flying cars and byzantine elevator systems and have giant computer tablets for refrigerator doors. Farrells true identity isnt far removed from Blade Runners ""Is he a replicant?"" question--such themes are common in Dicks work--and Wiseman is more inclined toward Blade Runners moody space adventure than the raw brutality of Verhoevens film. But Wisemans Total Recall isnt intellectualized like Blade Runner or even that much more sophisticated than his Underworld movies. Once Farrells wrong man goes on the run Wiseman mainly wants the chase itself to be the movie from the parkour-style dashes across rooftops and balconies to trading paint on magnetized skyways like some cross between Top Gun and carnival bumper cars. In an expansion on the Sharon Stone role Beckinsale--Wisemans real-life wife and muse--gets to kick all the ass she normally kicks in the Underworld series while throwing out a few sinister one-liners. She and Cranston both appear to be having fun as the bad guys but seeing Beckinsale punch and pound her way through blue-gray corridors underlines how little difference there is between Total Recall and Underworld. Theyre just new contexts for the same brand of vacantly stylized action. Adapting Total Recall to our globally fraught times isnt the worst idea--and there are some vague Occupy sentiments at play here--but Wisemans version is the definition of ""pointless remake"" an ineffectual gloss on potent material. Putting it next to the Verhoeven makes for a depressing case study in the state of the action movie Gone are Rob Bottins practical effects and the knockabout pleasures of Schwarzenegger being Schwarzenegger replaced by a low-impact CGI demo that does everything it can to stay within the PG-13 parameters while still inserting a callback to Verhoevens three-breasted prostitute. The breasts survive to arouse and confuse another generation of teenage boys but all other thrills are wrapped up in a digital chador.

"Total Recall Review Remember this? - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Total Recall Remember this?  1/2Colin Farrell replaces Arnold Schwarzenegger in a remake of the dystopian memory taleAugust 02 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticIn the opening seconds of the""Total Recall""remake the words ""original film"" appear on the screen referring to a production company calling itself Original Film. So before it even begins the movie delivers its first inadvertent joke.Original this thing is not and necessary its not either. Then again how many big-budget do-overs can be described as strictly necessary? Though director Len Wisemans film is more hectic than inspired it certainly moves. Its a straight-ahead PG-13action bash a goodly distance from director Paul Verhoevens madly grotesque and R-rated 1990 version starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.Like that one this one is a project based on a short story (""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"") by the dystopian fantasist Philip K. Dick. The best thing about Wisemans movie is the tactile quality of its imagined urban environments. Production designer Patrick Tatopoulos is the auteur here offering rain-drenched cities built straight up into the sky. These relate strongly to the worlds brought to cinematic fruition in""Blade Runner"" and ""Minority Report"" which also came from short stories by Dick.Like those films the ""Total Recall"" remake traffics in notions of duality riddles of identity and more to the point hover cars. Hover cars Honestly whats cooler? Very little thats what. ""Total Recall"" may depend on memory implants and ominous surveillance techniques to imperil our hero played by Colin Farrell but that stuff gets chucked out the window (just like Farrell whos perpetually leaping off a balcony or a ledge and surviving yet another ridiculous fall) for the films most gratifying stretch an expansion of the hover car chase in ""Minority Report.""The future may be a grind and global chemical warfare has reduced the globe to two lousy entities the United Federation of Britain (UFB) and the Colony previously known as Australia. But honestly its a good trade given the hover cars. Verhoevens version took the story to Mars and back again. Like the Dick story the remake remains an earthbound affair.Farrells character Quaid lives a decent if nightmare-plagued life; nocturnally he dreams about running from bad guys alongside Jessica Biel. His wife is played by Kate Beckinsale. (Beckinsale and Wiseman are wife and husband and previous collaborators on the ""Underworld"" films.) Quaids factory job lies on the other side of the world in the Colony. Quaids daily commute involves taking The Fall a massive rocket-type elevator that travels through the core of the Earth and out again in something like 20 minutes. The UFB chancellor (Bryan Cranston of ""Breaking Bad"") schemes to put down a terrorist insurrection for good. Bill Nighy plays the head of the rebellion which means its rebellion with an eccentric and slightly twitchy human face.For the uninitiated well simply say Farrells life is not what it seems and that first visit to the dream factory for a memory-implant vacation doesnt go well. Beckinsale gets to toggle between two accents and the talented and fiercely physical Biels musculature is more expressive than most of the dialogue. Wiseman shows minimal to moderate facility for shaping a complicated action sequence; what he has done though successfully is turn the capital of UFB into a wonderful/horrible futuristic metropolis something like London if London were built on a Rio hillside and then the hills were erased.I wish the killing mattered more and the human stakes were higher. (Much of the carnage is synthetic carnage i.e. the shooting and dismembering of police ""synthetics"" resembling clones from the George Lucas universe.) The synthetics march around in predictable patterns while one of the major characters struts around like an enraged supermodel. The movie marches in predictable formations as well. But when Biels rebel pulls over in her hover car and asks Farrell if hed like a ride your heart may sing as mine did.mjphillipstribune.comTotal Recall -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action some sexual content brief nudity and language)Running time 149Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesColin Farrell totally recalls unease about Total RecallAugust 1 2012Next in need of a visionApril 28 20075 Films Adapted From Stories By Philip K.

Like I dunno a bluegrass version of Pink Floyds ""Dark Side of the Moon?"" And at first youll be listening and think huh this is kind of fun. Then about halfway though youll think gee I dunno whats really the point of this? Then by the end youll be shouting stop stop on the soul of Syd Barrett please make it stop That is precisely what watching Len Wisemans ""Total Recall"" is like. The tune is the same - a blown-out action bonanza riffing on Philip K. Dicks (extremely) short story about memory experience Cartesian dualism specious temporality and to keep the intellectuals happy high-speed chases and gun battles. The 1990 version directed by Paul Verhoeven is a winning mixture of bone-crushing action heady sci-fi and seductive Arnold Schwarzenegger one-liners. This new version is true to the first in nearly all of its story beats but is dressed up with modern day flash. The special effects are better (or at least more prominent) the action is faster (or at least theres much more of it) and the explosions are bigger. This isnt so much a bluegrass version so much as a louder and faster version. The one major change is the setting. Douglas Quaid is no longer a mild-mannered (but muscular) construction worker dreaming of a trip to the politically volatile colony on Mars. This time were on a dystopian future Earth where pollution and war have destroyed most of the worlds livable space. The rich folk live in the United Federation of Britain a giant city in the sky with lot and lots of elevators and people who I suppose have gotten over their fear of heights. The bulk of humanity lives in ""The Colony"" a ""Blade Runner""-esque slum thats a mix of rainwater brutalist architecture and Asian signage. Its no fun Everyone there is miserable (you can tell because there are sleazy prostitutes in one scene) and they all have to go work their stupid jobs in the UFB. To get there you have to travel through ""The Fall"" a big tube that connects the two sides of the planet. Thats what Colin Farrell does slaving away manufacturing synthetic police droids. He dreams of something bigger of action and the ads for ""Rekall"" a memory-implantation service really strike a chord. He goes but fails to tell them that hes actually a real spy (or is he?) and that trips the programming to go haywire and for everyone to start shooting one another. Now Farrell must find out who he is but Kate Beckinsale the best thing in the movie and the only one who looks like shes having any fun is hot on his tail. Farrells journey of self-discovery leads him to lead the resistance movement toward some sort of freedom. Unlike the original it isnt about bringing air to the Martian landscape but basically giving the citizens of The Colony an excuse for not showing up for work tomorrow. To compare Wiseman and Farrell to Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger is a bit of a waste of time but it is impossible not to. I guess thats what you get when your movie is all about basking in your memories. (Further dumb luck the first title card on the screen is the production outfit ""Original Film."" No shortage of chuckles at the critics screening.) The fact of the matter is the original was much clearer of purpose had action scenes that were far more visceral and was a fundamentally better piece of entertainment. Part of the problem (apart from the dearth of fun) is that in this one we begin on the side of the oppressed. We begin with seeing that struggle figuring out what Rekall is plus exploring the new world of The Fall. The Rekall hook doesnt stand out quite as much and the whole endeavor feels a little rushed. Still it isnt unwatchable - the buildings look cool the fighting is fine Farrell is likable Beckinsales a hoot and Jessica Biel while hardly a master thespian bats her eyelashes real well. But the movie just has nothing to offer. It has nothing new to say despite shouting at the top of its voice. Its the same neo-Hans Zimmer music the same lens flares the same shot coverage of a gun battle of every forgettable summer flick. It takes a true hack like Len Wiseman to make you realize what a visionary Paul W.S. Anderson can be. More depressing are the cute winks. Like the novelty cover band Wisemans ""Total Recall"" isnt just about fan service (three-breasted hookers lines about Mars an obese women visiting for ""two weeks"") but going through a checklist of ""things you have to do if you do a Total Recall."" Heres where he finds the video of himself. Heres where someone steps in to say its all a hallucination. Arms ripped off by an elevator? Yeah yeah its in there too. But in the original it was a mans arms. Here a lifeless nameless robot. I think that just about says it all doesnt it?

Total Recall Bad Director Len Wiseman. Cast Colin Farrell Kate Beckinsale Jessica Biel. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action some sexual content brief nudity and language. Besides I suspect that the comparison actually does the new version a favor. Directed by Len Wiseman with far less artistry and humor than Paul Verhoevens 1990 original the new film still will probably play better to those whose memories hold even bits of the first who recognize certain elements. (Now theres some irony in a film about memories.) But for those who are new to the party its more likely to come off like a big dumb action movie -- a little smarter than some maybe but nothing special. Total Recall original 3.5 stars Future themes in new Recall resonate Interview Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale Then there is the matter of Colin Farrell in the role that helped launch Arnold Schwarzenegger as an action star (and not just a mindless instrument of killing). Farrell can act rings around Schwarzenegger but he brings none of the much-needed wit to the role (even if much of it came courtesy of bad puns) that Arnold did. Theres not as much humor good or bad in the new ""Total Recall"" and what there is seems forced. Farrell can be a funny guy (he was hilarious in ""Horrible Bosses"") but not here so perhaps its the fault of screenwriters Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback (the idea is still based on the Philip K. Dick short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale""). The first film took liberties with the story; this film drifts away from the first. No Mars no aliens no conjoined twins. The three-breasted hooker is still around though; some things never change. This time around Douglas Quaid (Farrell) works in a factory that makes synthetic cops. His wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) is an EMT. Its not the life they wanted living in a ratty apartment -- the look of Wisemans film has more in common with ""Blade Runner"" than the original film. Again there is no Mars. All thats left of inhabitable Earth is the federation of Britain and ""the Colony"" -- Australia. Workers travel back and forth by way of ""The Fall"" a sort of super-duper elevator that burrows through the Earth till it comes out the other side. Rebels led by a leader named Mathias (Bill Nighy) want to overthrow the federation which is run by the ruthless Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston). He wants to crush the rebels whom he has branded terrorists for their violent methods. Quaid is troubled by dreams in which he and a woman he doesnt know are fighting the synthetic cops. He decides to visit Rekall a company that implants memories saving you the trouble of say going to the beach in person. Or in Quaids case becoming a spy. Thats the package he chooses. But the implant goes awry from the start -- although he doesnt know it Quaid is a spy. Within seconds the synthetic cops are hunting him down. There are plenty of twists to follow -- some different from the first film (a crucial tear replaces a bead of sweat; if you saw the original thatll mean something). Quaid meets up with Melina (Jessica Biel) the woman in his dreams who is a rebel fighter and learns that he is not who he thinks he is -- as far as he can tell. Some of the chase scenes Wiseman orchestrates are fun and exciting. But the most important part of the story in any of its tellings remains the issues of identity and trust -- the question of whether any of this is really happening. Can Quaids memories be trusted? Can he? Unfortunately for all the fireworks this is where Wisemans version falls short. Its big and its loud but ultimately not much more than that.

"Total Recall | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; total-recall_2497 ) Total Recall (United States/Canada 2012) August 02 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its a hard thing for a filmmaker even an accomplished one to make a project ""his own"" when the original is well remembered as a vehicle for a star as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger. A mere 22 years have passed since the Schwarzenegger/Paul Vehoeven sci-fi/action collaboration Total Recall reached screens yet it remains as vivid as ever. The difficulty for Len ""Underworld"" Wiseman and his screenwriters is to recreate the essence of Total Recall while giving it more than just a facelift. To do this they keep many of the key moments intact while changing a myriad of details. One significant failure however is an inability (or unwillingness) to rectify the last act anticlimax. The biggest flaw of the 1990 Total Recall was how disappointingly banal the endgame was. Wiseman adds some special effects and Michael Bay-style pyrotechnics but the result is similar. Its doubly deflating because one of the great advantages of remaking a movie is being given the opportunity to correct problems - something not attempted here. Colin Farrells interpretation of the protagonist is predictably much different than Schwarzeneggers. Its a less tongue-in-cheek approach with no flippant one-liners (""consider this a divorce""). About all they share is the same name Douglas Quaid. At the time when the 1990 Total Recall came out Schwarzenegger was near the height of his popularity; Verhoeven understood this and gave him an extraordinary amount of latitude to please his fans. The result was Arnold being Arnold. Farrells interpretation is more low-key and introverted. One senses that had Wiseman wanted to take the story in a different direction Farrell could have embraced the mind-fuck aspect that is only hinted at. But since Wiseman sticks to the original trajectory theres rarely much serious consideration that significant portions of the movie could be implanted memories. Too bad Spike Jonze wasnt at the helm. That would have been a wild ride. Theres no Mars in this Total Recall. Oh Mars is still there and its mentioned in passing but its not part of the setting. The time period is the early 22nd century and a global biological war has left a majority of the planet uninhabitable. Those places still capable of supporting life - parts of Great Britain and Australia - are grossly overpopulated. Class warfare is erupting with the ""Rebel Alliance"" led by the messianic figure of Matthias (Bill Nighy) and the ""Empire"" controlled by Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston). Little attempt is made to disguise connections to Star Wars Cohageens soldiers look so similar to the clone troopers at the end of Attack of the Clones that one expects Yoda to show up and pronounce ""Begun the Clone War has."" Quaid is one of many grunts who makes a daily high-speed trip called ""The Fall"" from Australia to the U.K. through the Earths core. It takes about 17 minutes. Quaids daily routine is the same; he always sits next to Harry (Bokeem Woodbine) his best friend for as long as he can remember. When the day is over he comes home to his loving wife of seven years Lori (Kate Beckinsale). But theres something missing from his life and he only discovers what it is when a trip to Rekall a corporation offering to implant fake vacation memories uncovers a startling truth. It turns out that Quaid hasnt merely been fantasizing about being a secret agent; he is one. But he has no memories of his life as ""Hauser"" and no idea what he was like or who he was working for. Was he Cohaagens right-hand man or a turncoat who went to work for the rebels? And who is Melina (Jessica Biel) the dark-haired beauty who appears in his dreams? Most of whats interesting about Total Recalls story is replicated from the 1990 screenplay which was loosely based on Philip K. Dicks short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale."" In terms of plot innovation Wiseman and his writers bring little to the table. One can argue the benefits of moving the story from Mars to Earth but there doesnt seem to be a compelling reason for the change. Those familiar with the Verhoeven picture will immediately recognize this as a close cousin. There are some differences. The first and most obvious is tone. The 1990 Total Recall was justifiably rated R for its unflinching brutality. It also had a dark sense of humor. Wiseman has neutered the violence to get the coveted teen-friendly PG-13. His universe isnt kinder or gentler but he doesnt show things as graphically as Verhoeven did. The black comedy has also been muted resulting in a more generic approach. On the other hand the 2012 interpretation is more action-oriented. In fact numerous sequences are presented as non-playable sequences from computer games making one wonder whether the art designer had this in mind when designing some of the levels. I have played games like this before although my avatars rarely accomplish things as fluidly as Quaid and Melina. The characters of Lori and Richter from the 1990 version (played by Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside respectively) have been combined into one in order to give Mrs. Wiseman more screen time. Kate Beckinsale plays this role like shes still in one of those Underworld movies. Stones ass-kicking Ice Queen was a more compelling interpretation and that was two years before she opened her legs for Verhoeven in his follow-up. History will probably not repeat itself with the somewhat prudish Beckinsale. No one can fault Wisemans vision. His grim world although highly derivative of other dark futuristic science fiction enterprises (Blade Runner and The Fifth Element come to mind) is vividly represented via some of the most effectively splashy CGI I have recently seen. Theres a Lucas-like attention to detail. By comparison Verhoevens science fiction details seem dated and low-budget. Granted with access to CGI the 1990 Total Recall would have boasted a different look. This is the second recent remake of a 1980s film in which Farrell has participated and although this doesnt feel as utterly superfluous and vaguely insulting as Fright Night its not a poster child to argue why remakes can sometimes be good things. Given a choice between watching Paul Verhoevens interpretation of the material starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone (with an R rating) or Len Wisemans version starring Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale (with a PG-13) which would you choose? Case closed.

Then it surprised us all.In its engrossing first half ""Total Recall"" appears like it could pull off the same trick and be a late summer arrival thats unexpectedly good. Inspired by a Philip K. Dick short story -- but best known as that nifty and violent Arnold Schwarzenegger 1990 cult classic -- ""Recall "" like ""Apes"" traverses familiar terrain and allows something to take root thats similar yet unique.But after a rousing setup this visually striking remake falls back much too heavily on its action roots with one chase scene after another and another. After a while its tedious. The films premise is undeniably gripping Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) ventures into an Everymans nightmare while visiting a seedy underworld bordellolike bar. There he decides to escape lifes drudgery by injecting a drug called Rekal designed to give users the fantasy persona of their choosing. But just as Douglas is poised to get the Rekal flowing something goes amiss leading to a pile of dead bodies and just as many questions about who Douglas Quaid really is. Soon he discovers that his entire factory worker life is a sham and that hes actually a much-feared spy. Even his hot wife (Kate Beckinsale) isnt who she appears to be.Advertisement As Douglas finds his ordinary existence is anything but he runs into the woman of his dreams -- literally -- played by Jessica Biel. As he discovers more about himself he encounters the intense battle between resistance fighters -- led by actor Bill Nighy -- and the very Orwellian-like Chancellor Cohaagen (""Breaking Bads"" Bryan Cranston). Duplicity abounds and the plot twists and turns quite satisfyingly taking the time of course to add a wild fight scene between Farrell (very appealing as the confused Douglas) and Beckinsale (who goes a bit overboard as his relentlessly ferocious ""wife""). Theres even a cat fight between Biel and Beckinsale one that raises the question How does Beckinsale find the time to reapply lip gloss between smackdowns?None of this is taken too seriously and thats a good thing. Clever references pop up regarding the Arnie film and a quick flash of currency showing Obamas face on it gives the film a contemporary feel. Theres even a shoutout -- sort of -- to the Bay Areas Fremont where director Len Wiseman was born.Its too bad though that Wiseman (the ""Underworld"" movies) and screenwriters Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback resort to stuffing the latter part of the film with traditional chases. The parts in which they explore Douglas existential crisis and create a convincing dystopian future with respectful whiffs of ""Blade Runner"" (a nice touch given that Dick wrote the story that movie was based on) are much more interesting. Props certainly are due to Wiseman and production designer Patrick Tatopoulous who imagine two dazzling and claustrophobic realities the rainy Escher-like architecture of The Colony (where the futures have-nots dwell in subterranean levels) and the contrasting sterility of the controlling United Federation of Britain. Both are impressive as are the special effects and a chase scene involving hover cars.Fans of the Arnie film will likely be upset that Wiseman and company set the story on Earth instead of Mars but thats what Dick intended in the first place. Theyll surely be bothered that the raunchiness has been toned down to a PG-13 rating. That isnt entirely a deal breaker for me even though I do prefer Arnies gonzo version much more. This ""Recall"" plays it safe and while that doesnt make it a failure its also not a total success.Total Recall   1/2Rating PG-13 (intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action some sexual content brief nudity and language)Cast Colin Farrell Kate Beckinsale Jessica Biel Bryan Cranston Bill Nighy John ChoDirector Len WisemanRunning time 1 hour 58 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the last; Deadwood movie still on trackReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.
