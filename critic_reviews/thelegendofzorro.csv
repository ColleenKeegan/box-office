Antonio Banderass Alejandro is still fighting the good fight in Zorro mode but spouse Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has tired of the subterfuge which requires keeping his identity secret even from their ten-year-old son. Before long divorce proceedings are on the agenda shes hanging on the arm of a French count (Rufus Sewell whos obviously been watching re-runs of Allo Allo) her boy Joaquin (Adrian Alonso cloying) is dangerously copying Zorros exploits and ruthless mercenaries are trying to influence Californias crucial vote on secession from Mexico to join the United States.As Alejandros responsibilities as husband father and freedom fighter are pulled hither and thither the movie piles on the plotting as if determined to impress us. However having rather over-estimated our existing affection for the characters its over-elaboration soon becomes strictly academic and the 130-minute running-time something of an endurance test. With the exploits of Zorro junior and the bloodlessly Disney-ish swordplay seemingly shifting the target audience closer to the kiddie market such complication seems rather counter-productive in the circumstances especially since the below-par CGI and cartoonishly exaggerated action highlights prove resolutely un-thrilling. Zeta-Joness diva-ish swagger is hard to warm to this time round Banderas seems to be going through the motions and 007 director Campbells usual sure touch with set-piece mayhem seems to have deserted him. Truly its Zorro with a zzz.

Ran on 10-23-2005 Antonio Banderas doing what Zorro does best in amp;quo;The Legend of Zorro.amp;quo; Photo Columbia Pictures This guy just cant hang up his mask 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Legend of Zorro Adventure. Starring Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Martin Campbell. (PG. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The funny thing about pleasant nonsense is that at a certain point it stops being pleasant. And not long after that it becomes unpleasant nonsense. Thats not just a generalization but a summary of ""The Legend of Zorro"" a 130-minute adventure movie that overstays its welcome by about 80 minutes. In the sequel to the 1998 ""The Mask of Zorro"" which introduced American audiences to Catherine Zeta-Jones Antonio Banderas reprises his role as a mild-mannered aristocrat who moonlights as a masked avenger in old Spanish California. Don Alejandro de la Vega might seem ineffectual but when he puts on his black mask black hat and black cape he becomes unstoppable an acrobatic and seemingly bulletproof one-man wrecking crew. That hes also a bit of a show-off is fine. Douglas Fairbanks and Tyrone Power earlier screen Zorros showed off too because it was just understood that Zorros love being Zorro. The life of an aristocrat is dull and being Zorro is all the fun they have. But theres a line between the exuberance of Fairbanks and the silliness of George Hamilton in ""Zorro the Gay Blade"" and Banderas crosses it. In his first scene before preventing the stealing of an election he pauses to acknowledge the cheers of the crowd. ""The Legend of Zorro"" takes place in 1850 in the months between Californias vote to enter the union and officially becoming a state. The historical backdrop is sketchy because theres an allusion to the Confederate Army an entity that did not exist for another decade. Some years have past since the last installment and Alejandro and his great love Elena (Zeta-Jones) are married and have a son Joaquin (Adrian Alonso) who looks nothing like them but exactly like Paul Giamatti. Elena hopes that Alejandro will finally be willing to retire Zorro and spend more time at home. But he has one eye on the exit even as shes talking. Finally she just puts it to him ""If you walk out that door you are not sleeping here tonight."" This is Zeta-Jones saying this wearing a bodice and heaving and yet he still leaves. There is a word for this sort of fellow. Imbecile. From that opening ""The Legend of Zorro"" spirals into a convoluted series of incidents bordering on the impenetrable until theyre finally revealed as nonsensical. In the beginning all this energy translates into an atmosphere of high spirits but the movie gradually takes on a haphazard flailing aura serious one moment slapstick the next. Were expected to take Alejandro and Elenas estrangement seriously and yet be amused by their infantile bickering. Were supposed to regard Alejandro as a heroic figure and yet laugh at him when hes a silly stubborn drunk which he is half the time. Only gradually does the light dawn The reason that no one in ""The Legend of Zorro"" behaves like an adult is because the movie is intended mainly for children. Still its difficult to imagine too many kids wanting to slog through 130 whole minutes of this. Yet its watchable -- not remotely enjoyable but watchable. Rufus Sewell turns up as a wealthy suitor of the newly available Elena. Hes a Spanish immigrant who wants to start a wine empire in San Mateo and praises America for its government ""by the people and for the people."" So now we know where Lincoln got that line 13 years later. Sewell goes through the movie with an odd expression -- smirking as if there were a sour taste in his mouth but he doesnt really mind it; he almost thinks its funny. He was obviously watching the rushes. -- Advisory Theres violence not graphic but plenty of it.

"Legend of Zorro The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; legend-of-zorro-the ) Legend of Zorro The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Some sequels are made too soon while others are made too late. The Legend of Zorro Martin Campbells follow-up to his well-received 1998 feature The Mask of Zorro falls into the latter category. Its difficult to say whether the film would have been better had it gone before cameras three or four years ago but by 2005 it feels creaky and out-of-date. The production is suffused by an almost desperate attempt to recapture the mood of its predecessor but the tone is forced rather than natural and the resultant production is bloated contrived and not very entertaining. The Mask of Zorro worked because of its engaging mix of action romance and comedy. The Legend of Zorro goes 0-for-3 striking out as it tries (and fails) to recapture the pleasure offered by the earlier story of the swashbuckling superhero. The Legend of Zorro opens in 1850 with California preparing to vote to become the 31st state. Certain forces including those led by the racist McGivins (Nick Chinlund) will do anything to stop this including murder and ballot theft. Enter Zorro (Antonio Banderas) the defender of the people who punishes McGivins and ensures that the election runs smoothly. When the votes have been tabulated Zorro doffs his mask and returns home as Don Alejandro de La Vega to his wife Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and his son Joaquin (Adrian Alonso). An agreement with Elena would have Alejandro give up his alter-ego at this time but he wonders if Zorro might still be needed. This leads to a heated argument followed by a divorce. Alejandro becomes a drunkard and Elena is wooed by a French count Armand (Rufus Sewell) who has come to California to cultivate grapes for wine. Soon however it becomes clear that Armand is up to no good. He has ties to McGivins and is plotting something dastardly. Its up to Zorro to stop these two and save Elena. For the talent involved The Mask of Zorro represented perfect timing. Anthony Hopkins was looking for something to show off his lighter side. Antonio Banderas used it as an opportunity to maintain his status as a star/sex symbol. And Catherine Zeta-Jones vaulted from near obscurity to the A-list (capturing Michael Douglas attention in the process). The constellations are not as well aligned for The Legend of Zorro. Banderas hasnt been a big name for years. Zeta-Jones is no longer a fresh face. And Hopkins isnt in the movie. Moreover the chemistry between the two leads which was one of the highlights of the 1998 outing has evaporated during the intervening years. Despite numerous plot contortions designed to construct the framework for an artificial resurgence of the romance between Alejandro and Elena Banderas and Zeta-Jones no longer have the ability to generate sparks much less fire. The action in The Legend of Zorro is routine. The swordfights produce little in the way of excitement or suspense. Equally lifeless are the saccharine ""bonding"" attempts between Alejandro and his son. The boy admires Zorro for his flair but dislikes his father for what he perceives to be cowardice. Alejandro tries to teach his son that there are better ways than resorting to violence but its a lesson the movie abandons because violence is more fun on-screen that pacifism. The Legend of Zorro is also cursed with two of the least interesting bad guys in recent memory. While McGivens and Armand are unquestionably villainous theres nothing about them to cause audiences to hiss. Theyre boring. Nick Chinlund tries to do a little over-the-top ranting but it comes across as second-rate. And Rufus Sewell fails to convince us that hes more than an effeminate fop. Never do we believe that either of these men is in Zorros league. The question is not whether they will be toppled but why it requires an inflated running time of more than two hours for the swashbuckler to get the job done. One could argue that the influx of ""new"" superhero movies since 1998 has made Zorro outdated. When The Mask of Zorro was released the cinematic landscape was a superhero wasteland. Since then weve seen the emergence of the X-Men Spider-Man the Hulk Daredevil the Fantastic Four and (a re-imagined) Batman. Its a crowded field and this diluted version of Zorro doesnt hold up. Zorro has a distinguished history dating back to 1919. Its unfortunate that the latest installment of his saga makes him look like a relic whos ready for retirement.

"ZZ tops? Well sequel is spirited fun - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Bond ZZ tops? Well sequel is spirited funmovies - reviewOctober 28 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticMovie lightning rarely strikes twice in the same place. But in the case of the Zorro sequel The Legend of Zorro it hits close enough to set off sparks.Its not quite as much fun as watching Antonio Banderas and a then-unknown Catherine Zeta-Jones mix it up and mush it up for the first time as they did back in 1998. But the cast and crew reunite for a spirited revival of the old-fashioned and supremely entertaining Legend.Zorro a k a Don Alejandro de la Vega is married to the spitfire Elena now. They have a son (Adrian Alonso) who is old enough to worship the masked Robin Hood of old California more than his ever-absent dad. Mom isnt happy.""People still need Zorro"" Don Alejandro protests.""No you still need Zorro"" spits back Dona Elena.But Don Alejandro has reasons to be MIA. California is voting to join the United States. And in this hilariously inaccurate history lesson there are ""Confederate"" forces 10 years before the Confederate states exist and fundamentalist bigots and European secret societies out to foil this union.To make matters worse this trouble at the polls is spilling over into their home life. Zorro and the missus split up. Oily Count Armand (Rufus Sewell) is making time with Mrs. Masked Man.And government agents are digging into the chicanery of the various factions sucking the whole Zorro clan into their plot. Zorro has to get over the three-month bender he has been on since his divorce defeat the bad guys win back the fair lady and impress his impressionable son.This is a James Bond movie on horseback and in Spanglish. There are Bond fights and Bond villains and Bond villain speeches and Bond superweapons.Its almost Son of Zorro. The kid Alonso is a real firecracker. His swordfight with yardsticks with his priest-schoolteacher is one of the most delightful popcorn moments the movies have given us all year. And Banderas interacts with him with all the humor and heart he brought to the Spy Kids movies.Banderas and Zeta-Jones click again because theyre better as fighting lovers than as mere marrieds.And the action underscored by a flamenco-mariachi score is whooping-and-hollering-at-the screen fun. Epic sword fights a train chase back-flips by the barrelful all done with a PG family-action-film lightness that makes the whole thing just float by.No the tongues arent quite as firmly in cheek the one-liners arent as crisp and the action flags more times than it should. They didnt quite capture lightning in a bottle twice. But this Zorro does nothing to tarnish the Legend.

With Antonio Banderas Catherine Zeta-Jones. (100 min.)""The Legend of Zorro"" starring Antonio Banderas as the masked one made me long to re-watch ""Zorro the Gay Blade"" the great spoof starring George Hamilton. In that film the Spanish accents were meant to sound deliberately fake. (Zorro kept referring to ""the people"" as ""the pipple."" ) Here even Banderas sounds like hes having a hard time sounding authentic. Catherine Zeta-Jones as Zorros swashbuckling wife Elena looks fetching but doesnt have much to do otherwise. Zorros nemesis a French aristocrat played by Rufus Sewell sports heavy eyeliner and has plans to blow up America. He seems to be under the misapprehension that Zorro is James Bond. Grade C-- Peter RainerParadise Now (PG-13)Director Hany Abu-Assad. With Kais Nashef Ali Suliman. (90 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Said (Nashef) and his friend Khaled (Suliman) are recruited as human bombs by an underground Palestinian terrorist organization in the West Bank in the intermittently powerful ""Paradise Now"" which was directed and co-written by Hany Abu-Assad. He attempts with mixed results to get inside the psyches of men who would blow themselves up for the cause. The film is better than the recent ""The War Within"" which tried for the same things but ultimately and perhaps unavoidably we are left face to face with the unknowable. Grade B+- P.R. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Still in releaseDomino (R)Director Tony Scott. With Keira Knightley Mickey Rourke Lucy Liu. (127 min.)The real-life Domino a Bounty Hunter who died in June of an apparent overdose was the daughter of actor Laurence Harvey and supermodel socialite Pauline Stone. Clearly what lured director Tony Scott who knew Domino is the massive contradiction of her life Born into the glamour of London and Beverly Hills she ended up a female Rambo. Whatever reality the actual Domino may have possessed has been sliced and diced by Scotts usual barrage of whiplash camera work and rat-a-tat editing complete with flashbacks flash forwards and flash in-betweens. Grade C-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 8 scenes including nudity and implied sex Violence 20 brutal scenes. Profanity 186 harsh expressions. Drugs 30 scenes with drinking and 28 scenes with smoking.Dreamer Inspired by a True Story (PG)Director John Gatins. With Kurt Russell Dakota Fanning. (102 min.)When racehorse Sonador breaks a leg trainer Ben Crane (Russell) sees a potential brood mare if he can at least get her well enough to walk. Weve seen it all before but this one is so well made its a sure crowd pleaser. Grade B- M.K. TerrellSex/Nudity None. Violence 2 mild scenes. Profanity 4 mild expressions. Drugs None.Elizabethtown (PG-13)Director Cameron Crowe. With Orlando Bloom Kirsten Dunst Susan Sarandon Alec Baldwin. (123 min.)Drew Baylor (Bloom) is a shoe designer whose latest botched creation about to hit the stores is poised to collapse his company. As an added bonus Drews girlfriend dumps him and he gets word that his father has suddenly died in his hometown of Elizabethtown Ky. Jetting in from the West Coast to plan the funeral he encounters a flight attendant Claire (Kirsten Dunst). Their live-wire connection continues on the ground first at a distance via marathon phone chats and then face to face for more jawboning. ""Elizabethtown"" is scaled big but the experience is curiously uninvolving. Part of the problem is that Orlando Bloom is featured almost nonstop and yet he never seems to be in the movie. Ill say one thing for ""Elizabethtown"" Like every other Crowe movie it has a very well- chosen pop/rock soundtrack. It may not be much of a movie but its a terrific concert. Grade C-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 2 scenes of innuendo and implied sex. Violence 1 scenes attempted suicide. Profanity 11 expressions some harsh. Drugs 9 scenes with drinking.The Fog (PG-13)Director Rupert Wainwright. With Tom Welling Maggie Grace. (100 min.)Ghosts hiding in a supernatural fog sail into a small Oregon town in a boat they imagine to be a clipper ship. Their mission is revenge on the descendants of four men who murdered them and used their fortune to found the town a hundred years ago. The scariest thing about this paint-by-numbers remake is that it was No. 1 at the box office last week. Grade D -M.K.T.Sex/Nudity 2 scenes including implied sex Violence 19 horror scenes. Profanity 14 expressions. Drugs 7 scenes with drinking.Innocent Voices (R)Director Luis Mandoki. With Carlos Padilla Leonor Varella Xuna Primus. (120 min.)Chava (Padilla) is an 11-year-old boy caught up in the civil war in 1980s El Salvador in ""Innocent Voices"" which is partly based on the childhood of its screenwriter Oscar Torres. As an almost daily ritual Chava and his fatherless family dodge bullets in their cardboard shack as they attempt to maintain a semblance of sanity in a village turned battlefield. The subject matter is harrowing but the treatment is slick. The actors all of whom seem too posed and pretty are not particularly accomplished and director Luis Mandoki lacks the visual imagination to bring the story to a boil. Grade B - P.R.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (R)Director Shane Black. With Val Kilmer Robert Downey Jr. (102 min.)As a petty thief turned aspiring actor and detective in Shane Blacks raucously entertaining ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" Robert Downey Jr. is on screen almost all the time which is good news since few performers can hold the screen as well. His live-wire physicality is capable of just about anything. In his new film he uses it for comic effect; at times he is as jumpy and jerky as a cartoon character (Bugs Bunny to be exact). Black who wrote ""Lethal Weapon"" makes his directorial debut and he puts a fresh spin not only on that film but also on a whole slew of films noirs. Grade B+- Peter RainerSex/Nudity 13 scenes including nudity. Violence 20 gory scenes. Profanity 130 harsh expressions. Drugs 9 scenes with drinking. 8 scenes with smoking.Nine Lives (R)Director Rodrigo Garcia. With Glenn Close Dakota Fanning Holly Hunter. (115 min.)""Nine Lives"" written and directed by Rodrigo Garcia is something of a stunt Nine stories about nine women filmed in nine separate unbroken takes. Garcia has gone in for this sort of thing before - his last film ""Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her"" told five stories. The advantage of this format is that if an episode isnt working you can always wait it out until the next one comes along. The uneven ""Nine Lives"" has an impressive cast but the best section features the great Mexican actress Elpidio Carrillo as a prison inmate kept from her child. Grade B-- Peter RainerNorth Country (R)Director Niki Caro. With Charlize Theron Woody Harrelson. (126 min.)Theron plays a battered wife who fights sexual harassment at her job in the iron mines. She has her best role since ""Monster"" but overall ""North Country"" is too self-consciously scaled as an anthem for the human spirit. Grade B-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 16 scenes of innuendo and sexual harassment. Violence 8 scenes including one of rape. Profanity 76 harsh expressions. Drugs 11 scenes with smoking. 10 scenes with drinking.The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio. (pg-13)Director Jane Anderson. With Julianne Moore Woody Harrelson Laura Dern. (99 min.)Evelyn Ryan rewrote the definition of resilience in the 50s and 60s supporting ten children and an alcoholic husband by composing jingles and 25-word essays to win hundreds of contests. Moore makes a perfect Evelyn always upbeat and Harrelson as her ineffectual husband is borderline tragic. The film veers from tongue-in-cheek documentary to gritty drama to sitcom but its true to the spirit of daughter Terrys book and of Evelyns life - lumpy but filled with expectancy of good and utterly charming. Grade B- M.K.T.Sex/Nudity None. Violence 4 scenes. Profanity 25 expressions. Drugs 8 scenes with drinking.Shopgirl (R)Director Anand Tucker. With Steve Martin Claire Danes. (104 min.)Martin plays a dotcom millionaire who successfully woos Mirabelle (Danes) a salesgirl at Saks. Whether intentionally or not Martin has given us something truly spooky A full-fledged portrait of a hollow man. Grade B - P.R.Sex/Nudity 13 frank scenes of innuendo and sex. Violence None. Profanity 9 fairly mild expressions. Drugs 3 scenes with smoking. 11 scenes with drinking.Stay (R)Director Marc Forster. With Ewan McGregor Naomi Watts. (99 min.)If youre the kind of moviegoer who likes puzzling out the plots of insoluble movies then by all means rush to see ""Stay"" a great big blurry mess starring Ewan McGregor as a psychiatrist who gets pulled into the dreamscape of his disturbed patient played by Ryan Gosling. Besides these two Naomi Watts and Bob Hoskins also make appearances - the cast if not the movie is first-rate. The director Marc Foster most recently made ""Finding Neverland"" which could also serve as the title for his new film except nothing is found and ""neverland"" is too kind a term for the chaos he flings at us. Grade C-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 2 scenes of innuendo. Violence 10 horror scenes. Profanity 28 harsh expressions. Drugs 3 scenes with smoking. 4 scenes with drinking. 1 scene with prescription drugs.

"Banderas Zeta-Jones are back in Zorro but thrill is gone - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Banderas Zeta-Jones are back in Zorro but thrill is gone By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  October 28 2005 The Legend of Zorro"" is like a college reunion where everyone has been forced into the same clothes they wore in school. Nothing fits everythings out of style and the spectacle of people straining to act like their younger selves is mortifying in the extreme. This is why they serve alcohol at college reunions. Sadly youll have to suffer through the movie sober.The Mask of Zorro"" remember was a happy surprise -- a slickly enjoyable 1998 update on the old Tyrone Power swashbucklers that gave Antonio Banderass career a kick in the pants while unveiling a brand new star in Catherine Zeta-Jones. He was the foppish Don Alejandro Murrieta -- trained by the old Zorro (Anthony Hopkins) to be the new -- she was the saucy Elena Montero and with director Martin Campbells help they saved Spanish California from corruption and sneering villainy. There was derring-do to be done and Banderas and Zeta-Jones derring-did.Arriving seven years later Legend"" is more like derring-dont. The stars and director are back but the thrill is gone replaced by a muttonheaded script and slapstick comedy that starts in hectic mode and quickly strips its gears. The movie plays to the kiddie audience and fittingly the only amusing scenes belong to Adrian Alonso as Joaquin the rascally 10-year-old son of Don Alejandro and Elena. The boy has the acrobatic genes but since he doesnt know his dreary pop is also Zorro -- even when the two have a mask-to-face conversation -- maybe hes not as smart as he looks. Alonso does have a better time than anyone else though and that includes the audience.What was a simple revenge tale in the first film has become a tortuous spy comedy weighed down with weirdly heavy-handed America First-isms. California has just voted itself into the United States but an evil alliance threatens to wreck democracy at home while bringing ruin to the distant Union. A rotten-toothed gunman (Nick Chinlund) is on the scene but the real bad guy is easy to spot -- hes the French dandy Armand (Rufus Sewell) who appears to have won the heart of Elena after the leads quarrel and divorce most unconvincingly. Whos the target audience for this movie? The handful of Red Staters still munching Freedom Fries?The Legend of Zorro"" alternates between frantic overcooked action comedy and a preschool rehash of Hitchcocks Notorious"" and it only rarely lets Zorro buckle his swash in the confident style of the first film. (Theres a swordfight on a bridge thats a pip but thats about it.) Banderas and Zeta-Jones go through the motions but they know theyre in the sort of secondhand swill that should have headed straight to DVD.Part of the fun of the The Mask of Zorro"" was discovering Zeta-Jones one of the few modern stars to possess the charismatic oomph of the old studio gods. You can take her performance here as a courtesy nod to the film that started her career but the fact remains that shes changed and so have our perceptions of her. A married Hollywood supermom with a fat T-Mobile contract looks oddly out of place in old California.As for the gaunt Banderas whose career options have dwindled to providing the voice of Puss in Boots in Shrek 2"" and the upcoming Shrek 3"" theres nowhere to go but up. Legend"" is the kind of reunion where everyone looks as if theyd rather be elsewhere and after two-plus hours you will too. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Both swash franchises buckle their chances for success to the panache of Antonio Banderas the Spanish star who began his movie career in the queer demimondo of Pedro Almodovars early films and went on to become the dashing Latin Lover of stage screen and Melanie Griffiths household. At this point in his delightful career Banderas has catalogued every configuration of glower smolder wink twinkle pout grin and pose of ole of possible use for a gentleman whose constituency ranges from swooning women and their disarmed male companions to giggling children who only know him as supersecret agent/papa Gregorio Cortez. And Banderas uses all his old wiles in this well-oiled businesslike quite clangingly violent sequel to The Mask of Zorro. He reunites with Welsh-born senorita Catherine Zeta-Jones as Elena. And he follows Martin Campbells direction for yet another go at the old black mask flashy sombrero and Zorronic attitude of do-gooding. Theres no distinction to this sequel -- except that its designed with more calculation than ever to be a Saturday-afternoon seat-filler for the whole worlds pants. Legends cleverest notion (the cocky screenplay is by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and the piled-up story credits include original Zorro scripters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) is to move the action ahead 10 years since last we saw Z and E (The Mask of Zorro came out in 1998); now Alejandro de la Vega (Zorros daytime name) and Elena are the parents of 10-year-old Joaquin (Mexican scene-stealer Adrian Alonso). Its also a time when the oppressed viva Zorro-shouting good people of the California territory are on the verge of voting to become the 31st state of the union and villains appear in two forms silky cultured schemers like the aristocratic French vintner Armand (Rufus Sewell) and greasy-haired scar-faced stubble-cheeked wooden-toothed varmints like the ruthless robber baron McGivens (Nick Chinlund). Happy couples though make for dull superheroes (even Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl had to fight before they found strength in unity). And parenthood is now widely promoted in movies as a sainted form of superherodom all its own. So Zorro and Mrs. Zorro fight about child-rearing attitudes She says hes not home enough and kicks him out of the hacienda for a spell. And time is unnecessarily wasted misunderstanding each other when there is never any doubt not even to the littlest viewer that the two are meant to be together as superheroes and superparents. A couple of fancy fight sequences allow the stars and their stunt doubles to demonstrate how dashing they still look with swords in hand. And every shot of Zeta-Jones with rosy lips glistening black hair and at-home gowns of sumptuous design is a lit and composed thing of beauty. Still too many scenes -- particularly those with McGivens and his similarly unwashed henchmen -- emphasize gross butchery over the elegance of the blade. At least Joaquin has a couple of nice moments with his slingshot fighting against injustice in a pint-size way. The Son of Zorro? So long as theres injustice and Banderas in this world its a possibility.

Still there are enough crowd-pleasing moments amid the frenetic action to carve out plenty of dollar signs internationally. Bigger louder and considerably less charming than its predecessor long-deferred sequel ""The Legend of Zorro"" gets by mostly on dazzling stunt work and the pleasure of seeing its dashing and glamorous leads back in cape and gown. Coming seven years after ""The Mask of Zorro"" which generated 251 million worldwide pic also evokes unflattering memories of the bloated bigscreen ""The Wild Wild West"" and by introducing a kid into the swashbuckling at times risks devolving into outright silliness. Still there are enough crowd-pleasing moments amid the frenetic action -- coupled with goodwill toward the 1998 adventure -- to carve out plenty of dollar signs internationally. Picking up in 1850 the people of California are ""poor and desperate"" hoping that a charismatic action hero can help rescue them. In short nothing much has changed. Eager to become the 31st U.S. state through one of those special elections for which Californians are renowned Don Alejandro de la Vega (Antonio Banderas) leaps into battle as the masked hero Zorro to thwart an attempt to steal the ballots in the movies first and best sequence. Roughly a decade has passed since the original and Alejandros dual life is taking a toll on his marriage to Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) as well as his relationship with young son Joaquin (Adrian Alonso) who worships Zorro without knowing dads secret identity. After Alejandro is asked to choose between his responsibilities to the people and his family the couple abruptly splits -- a rather convoluted attempt to break them apart then create obstacles for them to overcome to get back together. A disconcerting three months pass before Alejandro discovers Elena is being wooed by a suave European count Armand (Rufus Sewell). Of course Armand is actually behind a nefarious anachronistic plot to block statehood as his henchmen led by the wooden-toothed McGivens (Nick Chinlund) terrorize the countryside and steal the land. What comes next provides all the De la Vegas the chance to strut their stuff showing how a family that slays together stays together. Director Martin Campbell is back in the saddle again but the firm hand he exhibited on the first go-round is shakier here as the opening hour flits all over and hits some curiously flat patches. Only in the second half does the movie settle in a bit and clarify what all the shooting is about as the pacing improves leading to an extended climactic sequence aboard a train that perhaps inevitably drags on a few miles too long. A quartet of writers contributed to the script and it certainly has the feel of work by committee. And while there are again welcome moments of humor some are pitched so broadly its easy to wonder if this is supposed to be a sequel to ""Zorro"" or ""Blazing Saddles."" Fortunately there are saving graces within the mayhem beginning with the chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones although not surprisingly it worked better when they were courting not a squabbling married couple. Still the years have been kind to both and they balance the uneven mood switches from comedy to drama about as well as possible. The same cant be said for the rest of the cast as young Alonso wrestles with unfortunately precocious dialogue and bounces around like a pint-sized version of his pop. Similarly Sewell plays Armand as something of a fop with a peculiar accent just as Chinlunds sneering villain is a little too cartoonish to be completely menacing. At its best pic displays flourishes of kinetic energy with Zorro leaping springing and flipping from one peril to the next -- a kind of Nijinsky in black. (For some reason though that gag in ""The Incredibles"" regarding the dangers associated with capes kept coming to mind.) Shot in Mexico its also a handsome recreation of the Old West from the impeccable costumes to lavish haciendas. James Horners score by contrast often sounds too florid even by his standards except for the moment when Zorro rides into the sunset probably not for the last time. In fact dont be surprised if the itch arises this time in less than seven years.
