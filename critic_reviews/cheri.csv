""Cheri"" Movie Review ""Course Im respectable"" the loathsome Noah Cross observes in ""Chinatown."" ""Politicians ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough."" Well Lea isnt an ugly building or a politician. But she has almost become respectable. Her timid titled lovers have given her canary-yellow diamonds and white marble mansions. She is past the age when she really needs to work and close to the age when she really should retire. Cheri (R) Miramax (100 min.) Directed by Stephen Frears. With Michelle Pfeiffer Kathy Bates Rupert Friend. Now playing in New York. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains sexual situations and brief nudity. Except theres a young barely legal man she calls ""Cheri."" Complicating things is that his mother Madame Peloux is an old veteran of Leas profession. And while its one she was happy to make her money in it is not one she wants her beloved son to marry into. ""Cheri"" is based on two novels by the late French novelist Colette and its not difficult to see its movie adaptation as the darker mirror image of ""Gigi."" While that film was about a girl being bred to please older men this is about an older woman hungry for the pleasures of younger flesh. But it doesnt alas quite come off. Some of that is due to director Stephen Frears who can be very good -- hes made ""The Queen"" ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and ""The Grifters"" among others - but tends to make his films a little too fast and too fast-paced. A movie like ""Cheri"" needs the time and space of ""The Age of Innocence."" Instead its rushed along in an hour and 40 minutes. Its made to move so fast in fact that scenes seem to be missing. Yes it is the late 19th century. But Lea is rich. Cheri has some money and the arranged marriage isnt a particularly ""good"" one. Why cant he and Lea simply run away? People did even in 1895. But here the conversation is never even broached. The final flaw comes in the casting. Kathy Bates is a delight as Cheris settled hypocritical mother. And Michelle Pfeiffer -- never lovelier or more honest -- is marvelously touching as the kept woman who can no longer keep the crows-feet from gathering under her eyes. But Rupert Friend who plays Cheri is a wispy nonentity an unholy cross between a lesser Jonas Brother and a moping Emo girl. Its ironic -- even tragic -- for the hardened courtesan to fall at last for a boy. But he should be a Hercules -- or at least a charming Pan. Instead hes an empty suit. ""I cant criticize his character"" someone observes ""maybe because he doesnt seem to have one."" Precisely. So why with all the loves shes sampled is this the one of Leas life? Bates is as always a breath of bracing fresh air. And Pfeiffer a perpetually underrated actress gives one of her best performances -- full of lust and regret bravery and hunger and finally touched with painful self-knowledge. Her Lea is a jewel. What a shame that its been stuck so hastily in such a mediocre setting. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

At 51 Pfeiffer has never -- I mean it never -- looked more ravishing then she does as Lea the fancy-free Paris courtesan of Colettes 1920 novel and its sequel. The actress is twinkly and creamy-skinned; she makes Lea a glowing knowing temperamentally ageless coquette. But the real freshness of her performance is that in a movie that has Lea involve herself with a much younger man -- the louche gullible Cheri (Rupert Friend) whos the wealthy son of one of her courtesan colleagues (Kathy Bates) -- Pfeiffer transcends any hint of cliche ""cougar"" voraciousness. These two lovebirds are playfully mismatched and thats just why they fall for each other. So when Cheri chooses unwisely to exit their romance for an arranged marriage Lea plots to woo him back -- by feigning merry indifference. And that more or less is the entire movie. Directed by Stephen Frears from a script by Christopher Hampton Cheri is like Dangerous Liaisons (which Frears also directed) reduced to a tasty morsel an anecdote of wily and deceptive love. It is if anything an overly slender movie yet its images of Belle Epoque high life are delectably lush and if there were more to the story it might not have such a delicate charm. Pfeiffer makes Lea that rare thing an angelic schemer and Friend who was one of the supporting weasels in the 2005 Pride and Prejudice proves a leading man of perverse fascination. As Cheri hes like a decadent cross between Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom with a puckish dimple of a mouth and a pose of snobbery that never quite conceals the heartache beneath it. Hes the entitled aristocrat next door.

Cheri Director Stephen Frears. Cast Michelle Pfeiffer Rupert Friend Kathy Bates. Rating R for some sexual content and brief drug use. Note At Harkins Camelview. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Cheri star Michelle Pfeiffer wears her years with pride Excuse me courtesan. Michelle Pfeiffer in her first film role in two years plays Lea de Lonval who retains the wealth and status courtesans enjoyed in pre-World War I France as were told in rather goofy narration by director Stephen Frears. It was something of a golden age for prostitutes he explains and in her prime Lea was the most beautiful of them all. The secret to her success? Never falling in love. Ahem. Guess where this is leading. Her last lover has run off to Russia so Lea is a free agent so to speak. During a visit to her onetime rival Madame Peloux (a miscast Kathy Bates who tries to compensate by overacting) Lea runs into Pelouxs son (Rupert Friend) whom she long ago nicknamed ""Cheri."" A dissolute sort hes wasting away at the ripe old age of 19 so Lea takes him to the South of France for some seasoning. This lasts six years - about 5 1/2 more than planned - and would go on indefinitely if Peloux hadnt arranged a marriage for Cheri to Edmee (Felicity Jones) the daughter of yet another courtesan. Its a strange circle. And although Lea has steadfastly avoided love at all costs - in fact at great reward - she is lost without Cheri. He meanwhile is even more adrift; the only person he has made more miserable than Edmee is himself. And thats pretty much your movie. Two lost souls drifting apart and inevitably back together again. As such the film is unusually dependent upon the acting and Pfeiffer holds up her end. She certainly doesnt appear as old and declining in looks as she is meant to yet she does convey the wistfulness of someone who knows her best days are behind her. Thus Cheri is even more important to her. Cheri on the other hand is a man whose life is something of a mystery even to himself - he doesnt know who his father is (Edmee doesnt know hers either) and hes unmoored from the usual concerns of most peoples lives such as working making something of himself that kind of thing. Yet Friend makes him more off-putting than he should be making it difficult for the audience to connect with him. If youre going to watch a movie about the trials and tribulations of the idle rich theyd better be compelling. Friend too often comes off as a brat who doesnt care about anything. So why should we? Frears who also worked with Pfeiffer and screenwriter Christopher Hampton on 1988s ""Dangerous Liaisons"" hasnt topped that film here. Maybe he hasnt tried to. ""Cheri"" is a serviceable period piece but not much more. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Read his blog at goodyblog.azcentral.com. Twitter goodyk.

The 51-year-old actress -- who hasnt had a lead role in a theatrically released movie in eight years -- is affecting and charming in this reunion with not only the director but also the writer (Christopher Hampton) of ""Dangerous Liaisons"" (1988). Based on two early 1920s novels by Colette (""Gigi"") -- reportedly inspired by a scandalous affair with her stepson -- ""Cheri"" has Pfeiffers Parisian courtesan Lea entering into what she thinks will be a casual fling with a callow 19-year-old nicknamed Cheri (Rupert Friend). The affair is endorsed as an educational experience by Cheris mother Charlotte (a very funny Kathy Bates) Leas bitchy and less well-preserved rival. Lea is surprised to find that her feelings for Cheri run deeper than lust and shes still hitting the sheets with her sexual protege six years later. At this point Charlotte announces that the floppy-haired Cheri is affianced to the virginal and beautiful Edmee (Felicity Jones) the 18-year-old daughter of a former courtesan. Cheri assents to this turn of events with typical French sophistication but shes hooked on the lad and is soon amusingly stalking Cheri all over the French Riviera. The movie is a visual feast with Oscar-caliber sets and costumes that for many will justify the trip to the Paris Theatre. But its hard to believe that the smart Lea would remain interested for six hours much less six years with the vapid Cheri. Part of the problem is Friend who lacks the re- quisite charm in the underwritten role. Truth is he and Pfeiffer have pretty close to no chemistry. Pfeiffer who is quite good makes a heroic effort to fake it -- after all she is playing a courtesan in ""Cheri."" CHERI Mad about the boy. Running time 92 minutes. Rated R (sex nudity drugs). At the Paris the Chelsea the Angelika others.

Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Friend star in the period romance Cheri. Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 25 2009 255 PM Title Cheri Period romance about an aging courtesan who falls in love with a much younger man. With Michelle Pfeiffer Rupert Friend Kathy Bates. Director Stephen Frears (140). R sexuality brief drug use. At area theaters.Though shes costarred opposite younger men in her last three films Michelle Pfeiffer has candidly complained about being tagged with the term ""cougar."" And who could blame her? She may be over fifty but surely age is irrelevant when you look as good as she does.That as it happens poses a bit of a problem for Stephen Frears ""Cheri."" Set in turn-of-the-century Paris the story twists around a middle-aged courtesan (Pfeiffer) who begins an affair with the playboy son (Rupert Friend) of her closest colleague (Kathy Bates).Though their relationship is meant to be shocking its clear that handsome young Cheri has done pretty well for himself in landing Pfeiffers mature Lea de Lonval. For one thing shes witty wealthy and willing to indulge his every whim. And for another well shes played by Michelle Pfeiffer.The story is based on two books by the French author Colette who weathered her own scandalous affair with a stepson. Frears skims easily over the novels emotional intricacy and social observations contenting himself with the rather superficial vision of two beautiful people falling in love pulling apart and trying to find their way back together in Belle Epoque France.Frears also directed Pfeiffer two decades ago in the caustic costume drama ""Dangerous Liaisons"" but given his refusal to delve too deeply into anyones psyche here this was clearly intended as a far more lightweight endeavor. Occasionally his casual tone feels jarring as with the overly-jaunty narration and complete indifference to the various accents cluttering his European setting.Still the movies shallow amusements do make for an ideal guilty pleasure especially since the actors seem to be having so much fun. Bates marching around like an overstuffed pigeon is a reliable scene-stealer while the two leads make an entirely convincing couple. And like the exquisite costumes the scenery is as gorgeous as most of the cast providing the perfect backdrop for some unabashed escapism.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Cheri"" is a sad intelligent film about coming of age late in life looking in the mirror and wondering ""What happened?"" Set in a gorgeous re-creation of pre-World War I France it concerns a beautiful young man who refuses to grow up and his much older lover who knows she is past her prime. Cheri whose given name is Fred is a spoiled dandy pampered and neglected by his mother Charlotte a well-to-do ex-courtesan. For six years -- at Charlottes request -- her former competitor Lea has instructed Cheri in the pleasures of the flesh preparing him for his eventual arranged marriage. The pair have been careful to keep their feelings in check in view of their inevitable separation. Its not until Cheri marries a lovely 18-year-old that they realize they are incapable of happiness apart. She leaves town and takes a new young lover who is handsome but gauche. He finds his new bride unsatisfactory. Lea and Cheri dance a waltz of reconciliation but their time is running out. Director Stephen Frears (""The Queen"") has adapted his film from two novels by the celebrated French writer Colette who observed her characters emotions with microscopic vividness and he does her full justice. The look is elegant the script urbane the grasp of a rigid social milieu assured. He has cast the film with a sharpshooters eye. Michelle Pfeiffers Lea remains beautiful certainly but she is a fabulous bouquet that is just off its bloom. She brings a great dignity and delicacy to the role allowing us to intuit Leas emotions from the angle of a glance the subtle insinuating inflection of a word or phrase. Rupert Friend as Cheri perfectly fits Colettes description ""not strictly feminine but a trifle prettier than one could have wished."" He is as spoiled as a cat in his early scenes and when he understands too late what he has lost his pain is nicely underplayed. Kathy Bates is sly and underhanded as Charlotte ever on the alert to other womens aging as she holds court among her old rivals. Isnt it lovely she pointedly asks Lea how ones neck holds perfume when the skin goes slack? As the characters age the social and political conditions change and the players do their best to adapt. Cheri a beautiful ornament without substance faces the hardest challenge in finding his way through a new world that values actions above feelings entrepreneurial accomplishments over dilettante refinement. CHERI  out of 4 stars Rating R for some sexual content and brief drug use. Where Edina. The characters inhabit a world of grand hotels opium dens top hats and ebony carriages but when the film is done we understand that they are no different from us. Insecurity heartbreak and regret are timeless and ""Cheri"" evokes them gorgeously.

""You are so beautiful"" he murmurs. Given that Fred whose nickname is Cheri is 30 years her junior and has been sponging off her for six years the compliment could be construed as part of his job description. But Lea is played by Michelle Pfeiffer so the young man isnt sucking up -- hes just stating the obvious. Lea stretches under Cheris appreciative hands. ""A good body lasts a long time"" she replies her tone purring teasing but also factual. ""Everybody knows that."" The movie an adaptation of two 1920s novels by Colette is superficially a slight affair a Belle Epoque costume drama capable of putting an action fan to sleep in 10 minutes (the sheets always remain artfully draped). Cheri (Rupert Friend) and Lea are star- or rather age-crossed lovers yet even the most romantic-minded moviegoer will likely struggle with them as exemplars of true love. Hes a shallow fop shes a jaded businesswoman. Theres more hauteur than heat in the way they interact and the tenor of Frears film and Christopher Hamptons script tends to the dispassionate much like Colettes writing. Emotionally speaking the pacing is languorous; almost all of the films impact is delivered in its last minutes when youve almost given up on it. (See the 100 best movies of all time.)Twenty-one years ago Frears Hampton and Pfeiffer got together for another bedroom drama set in France. Dangerous Liaisons raised the former Grease 2 star from the ranks of the extremely pretty people who make movies into the category of highly respectable Oscar-nominated actress. It was a smart career move for a 30-year-old woman. Cheri is the smart move of a 51-year-old actress and that is a radically different thing. It is a bookend to the story of a great beauty the kind that along with an irresistible purity entranced an incorrigible seducer named Valmont two decades ago as well as a moviegoing public and now -- only now barely now -- threatens to fade. As Lea points out a good body does last a long time. So can a good face. But the undercurrent of what shes saying is that nothing lasts forever. She first gets involved with the 19-year-old Cheri the indolent son of another highly successful retired courtesan (Kathy Bates) because she enjoys his youth and beauty (with his cheekbones and Cupids bow of red lips he looks as though he could be her in mens clothing). She tells her masseuse that she cant complain about Cheris character because shes not sure he has one. Nonetheless they end up in a sort of grudging kind of love. Lea cups a rose at one point in the story bends to it and watches it blow away in her hands. That might not be the most subtle scene Frears has ever shot but Pfeiffers expression wry exasperated sad is the payoff. Lea is tragically self-aware while enjoying afternoon tea with former colleagues which tends to be an amusing banter-filled affair she shudders with revulsion at the sight of a portly woman of about her own age -- although less well preserved -- clutching what looks to be a teenager to her decolletage. In theory Cheri might be considered part of the tedious cougar trend we keep hearing about although it is more of a refutation an invitation to cool our jets and act our age. The movie speaks to issues of traditional desirability and dignity specifically to the point in a womans life when she either makes decisions about how well those two qualities can exist together or has them made for her. If there is an art-house programmer out there whos looking for a double feature book Woody Allens latest -- Whatever Works in which Larry David hooks up with a 19-year-old girl -- right before Cheri and leave the theater open afterward for a debate on men women and aging.

Cheri Antidote to summer blockbusters | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentCheri Antidote to summer blockbustersIt is the age of La Belle Epoque in France the period from just before the dawn of the 20th century up to the World War I (which of course screws up everything).Michelle Pfeiffer as Lea de Lonval in Cheri.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterFri. June 26 2009Starring Michelle Pfeiffer Rupert Friend and Kathy Bates. Directed by Stephen Frears. 92 minutes. At the Cumberland. 14A It is the age of La Belle Epoque in France the period from just before the dawn of the 20th century up to the World War I (which of course screws up everything). And les belles whove shrewdly invested the jewels and gifts bestowed upon them by various European crowned heads in exchange for sexual favours are semi-retired and living the high life.Lea de Lonval (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) has lunch with old rival and fellow courtesan Charlotte one dappled sunny day and meets her son Frederic whom she has known since he was a boy she named Cheri. (His pet name for her Nunu. Gag)She invites him along for a summer holiday and they stay together for the next six years.Article Continued BelowBut it seems the languid love affair between an indolent young Cheri and a woman twice his age cant last forever. Charlotte arranges a match with a pretty young virgin and Cheri is torn between the woman he loves and the duty he owes to himself to become a young man of means living an aimlessly decadent bourgeois lifestyle. Director Stephen Frears has made some truly memorable films in his career (The Queen Dangerous Liaisons My Beautiful Laundrette The Grifters etc.) that focus on outsiders looking in to the larger society and Cheri nicely fits the mould.In this case a narrator sombrely informs us that ex-courtesans such as Lea and Charlotte can never be fully accepted into proper society (theyve simply slept with too many husbands for that).Society would doubtlessly frown on a life-long love affair between a sexy young monsieur and a gorgeously well-preserved woman of a certain age. And thats the conflict at the heart of Cheri. Like the two lovers in Brokeback Mountain what stands between Lea and Cheri is their own belief that their love isnt strong enough to weather the vagaries of time and conventional mores.But there is something rather hollow in this whole exercise that makes Cheri (the film not the guy) seem rather plaintive and existentially dreary.Frears has spared no expense in providing costumes and settings throughout that are sumptuous and gorgeous.The screenplay by Christopher Hampton (who did such a fine job adapting Dangerous Liaisons) from two works by French novelist Collette is teeming with sharp and witty dialogue.Pfeiffer is as always mesmerizing in portraying a woman who has always been able to create an inpenetrable barrier between sex and love but finds herself like an old fool in love unable to master her feelings for Cheri.Kathy Bates as Charlotte is a delightful comic buffoon.But Rupert Friend is almost too good at playing Cheri as a spoiled rotten teen who grows into an irredeemably cruel and selfish young man whose focus on his own needs and desires borders on sociopathy.By the end it almost seems as if Frears has wearied of the tale bringing in the narrator to dispatch Cheri to his fate (an unhappy one) in a few well-modulated sentences.The audiences reaction may well be the same. Frankly mon Cheri we dont give a damn.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

ABOUT THE MOVIECheri  1/2 (our of four)Stars Michelle Pfeiffer Rupert Friend Kathy BatesDirector Stephen FrearsDistributor Miramax FilmsRating R for some sexual content and brief drug useRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Cheri is a feather-light confection pitting lamour against outrageous liaisons. The title character and his older lady love flout the rules push sexual boundaries and stumble on something of substance under all the flirtation and fun. Based on the novels Cheri and The Last of Cheri by the French novelist Colette this November-May romance is set in an elegant Paris during the turn of the last century. The distinctive costumes and ornate belle epoque furnishings are a sumptuous sight. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Lea de Lonval a beautiful courtesan nearing the end of her successful career. The middle-aged Lea embarks on an unlikely tryst with the handsome 19-year-old Fred (Rupert Friend) whom she nicknames Cheri (""darling""). Lea initially approaches the romance as if she were merely training Cheri the son of her archrival Charlotte (Kathy Bates) in the art of lovemaking. The strapping bon vivant throws himself into a single-minded pursuit of pleasure and trades seductive quips with Lea. Though they act as if its a frivolous fling their six-year union becomes the longest and most significant relationship for both of them. Hoping to shatter their unseemly bond the scheming Charlotte arranges a marriage for Cheri to a young woman his age. Meanwhile Lea tries to resume her old profession. But neither realizes is how complicated their connection is. Lea is smart and independent while Cheri is fun-loving and almost childlike. Lea fears growing old. Cheri is content to avoid manhood and the responsibilities it entails. These themes are timely given our youth-obsessed culture. But their affair is never wholly convincing as an all-consuming passion. The narration by director Stephen Frears falls flat. Mostly though the souffle-thin story is simply not all that compelling Pfeiffer is graceful and coolly assured while Friend so wonderful in Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont is less consistent here. Sometimes hes an endearing presence. Other times he is simpering and callow. Frears (The Queen) returns to the naughty folderol of his Dangerous Liaisons with this decadent comedy of manners. While the humor has its droll moments the dialogue is more vapid than clever. Cheri like the character is an entertaining bauble without much on its mind.

"Movie Review John Anderson on ChA(c)ri Starring Michelle Pfeiffer washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movie Review John Anderson on ChA(c)ri Starring Michelle Pfeiffer Michelle Pfeiffer Rupert Friend and Kathy Bates star in the period drama ""ChA(c)ri"" adapted from novellas by Colette and directed by Stephen Frears who helmed ""Dangerous Liaisons."" (By Bruno Calvo -- Miramax) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By John Anderson Special to The Washington Post Friday June 26 2009 In addition to being lovely Michelle Pfeiffer has always been lovable. ""Married to the Mob""? ""The Witches of Eastwick""? ""The Age of Innocence""? Adorable. Still is. Shes just not 18 and brainless which makes her a leper in Hollywood. But it also means she carries the right baggage to a movie which for all its big hats and flowers is about the perverse manner in which human beings view beauty age sex and passion -- and make presumptions about them all. Its just too bad her new movie doesnt have more juice. ""ChA(c)ri"" based on twin novellas by Colette reunites Pfeiffer with Stephen Frears the wily irascible director of their previous collaboration ""Dangerous Liaisons"" (1988) a movie that also found something in antique situations about modern hypocrisy and amorality. As ""ChA(c)ris"" uncredited narrator Frears uses the films first few moments to set up its conceit Imagine a world he says in which people who prostituted themselves werent automatically successful. As indicated Frears has some issues with the frivolity of contemporary culture (not surprising for a filmmaker schooled in the social consciousness of the 70s BBC). His perspectives do inform and enlighten ""ChA(c)ri"" which has a screenplay by Christopher Hampton (""Atonement"") and as previously indicated an abundance of clothes and hats. But while ""ChA(c)ri"" may be eye candy for the couture crowd its also a lament for the demise of conformity. What else after all gives nonconformists any traction? How can you be a rebel an upstart when nonconformity is a fashion accessory? It wasnt 100 years ago when (according to Colette at least) a subculture of ""courtesans"" achieved prototypical notoriety/celebrity. Among the A-listers is Lea (Pfeiffer) a famed Parisian well schooled in pleasure and the politics of the personal who is approaching that point when she will age out of her profession. (Any parallels to Hollywood are no doubt intentional.) With friend and colleague Madame Peloux (a terrific Kathy Bates) Lea wends her way through Hamptons insouciant banter with decadent assurance and an eye on the clock -- which is why she adopts as her project and her lover ChA(c)ri (Rupert Friend) Madame Pelouxs son and a candidate for early debauchery. (""I cant criticize his character"" his own mother says ""since he doesnt seem to have one."") What begins as a lark turns into love. And what began as a frothy period piece becomes a meditation on the tyranny of the so-called normal. ""ChA(c)ri"" is set at a time when to ignore society was to incur something other than good publicity. In other words it cost to defy convention. And the acknowledgment of that cost keeps ""ChA(c)ri"" from floating away on a cloud of crepe de Chine. But for all its craft and Frearss tart sense of humor ""ChA(c)ri"" suffers from being about feelings rather than story. ChA(c)ri proving that even a sub-rosa society has its regulations will marry the young innocent Edmee (Felicity Jones) at his mothers insistence making his young wife suffer in her marriage while he and Lea suffer in their separation. All around them Frears finds ways of reflecting in people and situations the way the couple fear that outsiders see them -- as ridiculous pathetic or doomed. As a technique it can be haunting. ""ChA(c)ri"" also looks terrific if a bit gauzy at times and Frears is never at rest. Still the movie bogs down by going nowhere other than inside its characters. They may be intensely passionate but as a more contemporary romance might put it the question remains whether the problems of three little people amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Or that one. ChA(c)ri (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for sexual content and drug content.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Cheri Drama. Starring Michelle Pfeiffer Kathy Bates and Rupert Friend. Directed by Stephen Frears. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Now that shes past 50 can we all stop holding Michelle Pfeiffers looks against her and just admit that shes a great actress? I know she doesnt look like one or carry on like one and her way of speaking is just plain middle-class American of a kind you might hear in any shopping mall from coast to coast. But since ""Married to the Mob"" (1988) Pfeiffer in her own unfussy way has been chalking up a series of rich performances full of intuition subtlety and psychological insight. And her latest film ""Cheri"" finds her at the height of her ability in a role worthy of her maturity and emotional intelligence. Pfeiffers particular talent is a capacity to express emotion without showing it to play someone in the midst of turmoil who knows she cannot allow others to read what shes feeling - yet she shows those feelings to us. In ""Cheri"" based on a pair of novels by Colette she plays Lea a courtesan coming to the end of a successful and lucrative career a woman who has spent decades working within the constraints of public ritual. Shes a master of self-presentation who is flawless in her style and dress and knows never to show a sign of weakness. Photo Bruno Calvo Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 Michelle Pfeiffer as Lea de Lonval in the movie ""Cheri"" one of the movies showing at the 2009 Berlin Film Festival Michelle Pfeiffer as Lea de Lonval in the movie ""Cheri"" one of the movies showing at the 2009 Berlin Film Festival Photo Bruno Calvo Review Pfeiffer at her peak in Cheri 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Cheri"" begins circa 19o8 during the last great flowering of Frances opulent Belle Epoque. A lot of beauty will soon be leaving the world forever - elaborate horse-drawn coaches hats and dresses with layers of fabric and Art Nouveau architecture - but for now its flourishing. In a similar way Lea too is in her last great flowering and will soon be leaving her youth. A refreshing aspect of ""Cheri"" is that Pfeiffer actually plays her own age. Here ""older woman"" is not defined as 35 but as somewhere around 50. Lea takes up with the son of a former courtesan her friend and sometime rival Madame Peloux (Kathy Bates). Cheri (Rupert Friend) is a handsome brooding young man - a true dark spirit - and Lea intrigued brings him to her country home. Six years later hes still there though implicit in their interaction and even in their banter is the understanding that this cant last forever. In the hands of director Stephen Frears and screenwriter Christopher Hampton the team behind ""Dangerous Liaisons"" (1989) this story of two ultra-sophisticated lovers becomes a heartfelt look at the strains and challenges of an older woman-younger man relationship. As he is coming into his manhood she is transitioning out of young womanhood into another phase of life. Its a poignant thing to find Pfeiffers face balanced right on that line between youth and age and seeing her I cant help but feel that Im seeing something that goes beyond the boundaries of the film that Im seeing a whole generation move from one stage to the next. Pfeiffer has worked in the film industry long enough to understand what it means to survive in a world of appearances and she brings that hard-earned wisdom and self-knowledge to Lea. Theres a good deal of pain in the role - Lea is a woman in the throes of a once-in-a-lifetime passion - but underlying all that is the sense of someone who really knows herself. Its a virtue of maturity wholly lacking in Cheri skillfully played by Friend as a young man in no position to know his own heart because he doesnt know himself. In addition to the splendor of the performances the wit of the script and the rightness of the direction the films physical beauty is part of its allure. Ive always thought of the early 20th century as a stylistic wasteland until the 1920s came along to wake up the world. But through designer Consolata Boyles hats and gowns we get a crash course in the life attitude and vibrance and of this beautiful epoch. -- AdvisoryThis film contains sexual content and brief drug use.

From Choderos de Laclos defining document of 18th-century French literature they spun a movie that brilliantly contrasted the cynics who play love as a sport against the romantics visibly elevated by the union of two souls.Lightning does not strike again with ChA(c)ri. Frears and Hamptons version of Colettes heartrending novels - ChA(c)ri and The Return of ChA(c)ri - about a young man initiated by an older woman in the teens of the 20th century is surprisingly flat. The tale of the childless courtesan who in her retirement essentially adopts the fatherless 19-year-old son of a colleague succeeds in attractively framing the lovers poses but not in conveying their inner transformation.So accustomed are LA(c)a (Michelle Pfeiffer) and ChA(c)ri (Rupert Friend) to regarding love as a business that they fail to see how it alters them. (This is not for lack of mirrors. Looking glasses - gilded silvered and beveled - line every salon and boudoir reflecting social and sexual performance.) Their erotic adventures are depicted in the nature of French postcards.Frears and Hampton (and their gifted collaborators) get a lot right. The sumptuous Belle Apoque interiors are worthy of Manet the shimmery gardens of Monet. You want to dive into the screen and slide your fingers across the silky upholstery and run barefoot through fragrant flower beds.Pfeiffer as the middle-aged minx is ravishing and Kathy Bates as her onetime rival and ChA(c)ris busybody mother slyly funny. Friend is indolent and sleepy-eyed with lips like ripe plums. The actors strike the correct notes but the tone of the film is all over the place. As is the camera.If you are not familiar with the source material a May/September romance about the power and powerlessness of love will you understand from this film that the seriocomic story is one of literatures great tragedies? I think not. On the page the narrators tone is clearer than it is on-screen where images dominate dialogue.In the filmmakers defense the challenges of reproducing literatures nuances on screen are so immense that probably only two in 10 adaptations succeed. Still Frears need only look at two of his own adaptations Liaisons and High Fidelity to understand what went wrong here. In those films the lovers were kept in extreme closeup all the better to see their romantic confusion. Here LA(c)a and ChA(c)ri are jewels hard to appreciate for all the fussiness of their overwrought settings.LA(c)a is a 19th-century sensualist who understands that in the 20th century the rules of her game have changed. ChA(c)ri the coddled child of his courtesan mother and effectively of his own courtesan lover is a trophy rather than a man. He has a hard time adjusting to social shifts and expectations that he should be conventional. Unlike Colettes Gigi about a girl who is raised to be a courtesan but weds an aristocrat ChA(c)ri doesnt know how to defy expectations.The films brittle voice-over narration (by Frears himself) presents LA(c)a and ChA(c)ri as a mismatched pair of debauchees done in by her age and his youth.In the movie LA(c)a is a woman tired of catering to older men happy to train a younger model to her own tastes; ChA(c)ri a sleeping beauty waiting for Princess Charmante to awaken him. What is lacking in this version with its hasty third act and abrupt denouement is the surprise that their union may be the deepest love either will ever know.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 26 2009 Save for later Saved Michelle Pfeiffer has a career triumph in ""Cheri"" playing an aging courtesan. Aging has never looked so good. At 49 her Lea de Lonval realizes that her glory days along with the waning hours of La Belle Epoque are over and so for sport she decides to take up with a 25-year-old dandyish Adonis named Cheri (Rupert Friend). She plans to teach him a few things before sending him on his way. What she doesnt count on is that they will fall in love with each other.Directed by Stephen Frears written by Christopher Hampton and based on two celebrated novels by Colette - ""Cheri"" (1920) and ""The Last of Cheri"" (1926) - ""Cheri"" is being promoted as a frisky comedy. Its a great deal more melancholy than that though. Frears summed up Lea in an interview where he stated that ""shes unnerving as though being that beautiful contains its own tragic quality."" The tragedy lies in what is being taken away. For a courtesan whose face and figure are her fortune the diminishment of beauty is especially burdensome. But Leas masklike radiance in this film transcends youthful allure. Shes more mysteriously beautiful than ever. This is what Frears was aiming for - the incandescence of the tragic - and it is what Pfeiffer so movingly conveys.Because she started out in the movies as glorified eye candy - she had the standard surfer chick look - it took a while for Pfeiffer to become recognized for the great actress that she is. In ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" ""The Age of Innocence"" ""The Russia House"" and many other films she has a force and a frailty that astonish. (Ive always wished she could play a Chekhov heroine.) In ""Cheri"" as in ""The Age of Innocence"" she can move right into a plush period piece and give it a present-tense vitality. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? It would have been easy in ""Cheri"" for Pfeiffer to play Lea as a weepy victim but she understands that Lea has her pride. Pfeiffers performance is all about what lies beneath Leas pride. She is savvy enough to have lived extremely well off the ministrations of wealthy men but to her amazement and fascination Lea for the first time finds herself in love. Its not just that Cheri brings her back to her youth. He also reminds her of what has been lost. When he leaves her for an arranged marriage and then returns to her she says to him ""You came back and found an old woman"" and she is not simply fishing for a compliment. She means it. Lea has achieved success in life by being brutally practical. Even in love she cannot submit to false delusions. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Cheri Frears creates a buzzing cackling universe of old-time courtesans including Cheris mother Charlotte Peloux (Kathy Bates) once Leas rival still an adversary. Bombastic devious her dark sprawling home chockablock with vulgar gewgaws Charlotte is everything Lea is not. (Charlotte spins her years by reporting that ""saggy flesh holds perfume better."") Lea not only wants to rescue herself she also wants to rescue Cheri from the clutches of such a woman. The airiness of Leas Art Nouveau house with its soft pastel colorations is a blissful respite for him.Frears and Hampton previously collaborated on ""Dangerous Liaisons"" which also starred Pfeiffer and to which this film no doubt will be compared. But the gamesmanship in ""Cheri"" is far more nuanced. The only thing at stake ultimately is the human heart. The film might have been even better if Rupert Friend were a stronger counterweight to Pfeiffer. He has a tendency to let his looks do his acting for him. But as Cheri he presents the right ripe image and in any event Leas passion for him is not intended to be entirely rational.How could it be? She muses at one point that she was born decades too early for him but if they had met up at the same age their liaison would have been dimensionless. Leas sweet sorrow not to mention Cheris is inextricable from their disparate years. Plenty of terrible movies know how to work your tear ducts. Heres a weepie that in Pfeiffers performance touches you on the highest levels. Grade A (Rated R for some sexual content and brief drug use.)

Stephen Cole From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 25 2009 206PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Cheri Directed by Stephen Frears Written by Christopher Hampton Starring Michelle Pfeiffer Kathy Bates and Rupert Friend Classification 14A Screen actresses hoping for a lengthy career should look to specialize in lightweight comedy. Take Sandra Bullock and Julia Roberts busy romcom queens since the early nineties. Serious actresses meaning those who would find fidgety Hugh Grant a chore dont last nearly that long. Consider Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer beautiful stirring leading ladies - women of evident depth and soul - who have had almost nothing to do in Hollywood this decade. Theyve banded together in Cheri  with Lange executive producing and Pfeiffer starring in an adaptation of Colettes tales of the Paris demimonde during La Belle Epoque - the ceasefire between the Franco-Prussian War and the First World War. Now why would a couple of smart American women want to do something like that you might be thinking. Except remember Pfeiffer was quite good in Dangerous Liaisons and The Age of Innocence  love-is-war social dramas set in centuries past. And Colette is famous for knowing the female heart. More reason for hope British filmmaker Stephen Frears and playwright Christopher Hampton the creative team that made Dangerous Liaisons so droll and dangerous have reunited to show Pfeiffer around France. The actress plays Lea an aging still-vital Paris courtesan and clothes horse who as the film begins drops in on best friend Charlotte (Kathy Bates) a retired prostitute. They meet deep-dish drink then gossip some more. Sound familiar? Colette may know women and Paris in 1905 but the Sex and the City that Frears and Hampton have in mind would appear to be the HBO series of 1998-2004. Thats not entirely bad. Pfeiffer has a way with hats and Bates steals every scene not nailed down with a sledge hammer. ""You smell wonderful"" Charlotte tells Lea then lowering her eyes brandishes the blade. ""Dont you find that when the skin is a little less firm it holds perfume so much better?"" But Sex and the City always knew the difference between frivolity and meaninglessness. The love stories had weight. The breakups threw off shrapnel. Cheri really doesnt work because its central love story - Leas romance with Charlottes louche son (Rupert Friend Pride amp; Prejudice ) - lacks dramatic force or even enough fun scenes to keep us going. ""Tell me something about yourself"" Lea asks Cheri early on. ""Theres nothing to tell"" the teenager replies. Hes being honest. Cheri is beautiful lazily funny and sweetly corrupt. Perhaps Lea sees her young self in him and feels 19 again. It happens. Still it doesnt matter that they really love each other; whats vital is that the audience falls for them. We dont. Worse Lea and Cheri never make it to swank Paris clubs like Maxims. In fact they dont get out or say very much at all. Just hide out in lavish bedrooms swimming in soft sheets and fleecy piled-high blankets. Some romance. At times Cheri feels like a fabric-softener infomercial. Whats so distressing about Michelle Pfeiffer taking a mooning calf for a lover though is that it robs her of the quality that has always made her such an interesting actress. Ever since we first saw her descend in a glass elevator wearing a silk slip lowering herself to be with Tony Montana in Scarface  Pfeiffer has exhibited an impulse for danger that is at war with her regal good looks. She is at her best slow-dancing with the devil - consorting with drug dealers mobsters spies jazz musicians and Satan himself in films such as Tequila Sunrise  Married to the Mob  The Russia House  The Fabulous Baker Brothers and The Witches of Eastwick . What a drag to see her settle for a harmless pretty boy in a flower-filled French villa.

(Bruno Calvo) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / June 26 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + It takes a while for ""Cheri to limber up and get to the heart of the matter. A Belle Epoque romantic drama reuniting some of the talents from 1988s ""Dangerous Liaisons - director Stephen Frears star Michelle Pfeiffer writer Christopher Hampton - the movie at first seems a waxwork parody of Merchant Ivory-style filmmaking. Its all bustles and brocades and arch dialogue and theres the additional incongruity of a California blonde amid the 1890s stemware.Yet Pfeiffer has worn period gowns before in ""Liaisons and 1993s ""The Age of Innocence and she has worn them well. If her voice remains flatly American as an actress shes alive to the genres diplomatic nuances - the way a woman in a corseted society can say one thing while meaning the exact opposite.""Cheri is based on a pair of novels by the French writer Colette the first of which caused a scandal by turning the cliches of romantic fiction upside down. For one thing Cheri is a man a young and dissolute Parisian played with Pre-Raphaelite fragility by Rupert Friend. For another his lover Lea de Lonval (Pfeiffer) is several decades older than he. For a third shes a courtesan recently retired. ""Women who do what we do no one else would understand Lea says. Well yes but we live vicariously through fiction. Colette knew that and so do movie producers.Cheris mother Madame Peloux (Kathy Bates) is a former courtesan herself living opulently on the earnings of a professional mistress. Shes a battle-ax and a busybody - stuffed into her bodices like a sausage Bates has a high old time - and she tosses her son to her friend Lea for a little toughening up. Six years later the pair are still together comfortable without ever confessing to emotional intimacy. That only comes when Madame Peloux arranges Cheris marriage to the innocent young Edmee (Felicity Jones).Separated Lea and Cheri maintain respective stiff yet wobbly upper lips. ""Cheri is a less tart story onscreen than on the page and its keynote is pining. Pfeiffer and Friend each wilt in interesting ways she with ladylike stoicism he with brooding petulance and Friend is a good enough actor to play to the thwarted little boy under the dashing young man.All well and good and nothing you havent seen in other movies where the characters tend to get upstaged by the drapery. What makes ""Cheri worth your while is that its true subjects are women and age and its observations apply to both 19th-century France and the modern film industry. Like her character Pfeiffer is a celebrated beauty on the far side of the curve doomed by a Hollywood that to quote ""The First Wives Club thinks the three ages of women are babe district attorney and Miss Daisy.The actress knows this. The proofs in her performance a surprisingly layered work of confidence panic acceptance and vanity (both Pfeiffers and her characters). Lea keeps looking at her hands as if expecting her skin to betray her; at times Frears and his cinematographer Darius Khondji cruelly turn up the lights to accentuate the pallor and sag of Pfeiffers face. Theres an awareness too of the ways civilized society turns beauty into a commodity. ""What am I worth to you? Lea scornfully asks Cheri and the question ripples right out past the screen.The movie introduces a few old harlots who are grotesque parodies of Lea the couples worst fears made flesh. None is as arresting as Anita Pallenberg the bad-girl beauty of the British 60s pop scene and now a withered beldame who resembles nothing so much as her onetime lover Keith Richards in drag. Cheri asks about her pearls. ""Theyre fake she gleefully croaks.If the movie were better - less swoony more relentless - it might be unbearable to watch. As it is ""Cheri touches on the insecure egotism of courtesans and movie stars with a knowing firmness. Yes Pfeiffers still one of the most beautiful women in the business but what does that get you in a business addicted to youth? In the movies most harrowing image she stares through the mirror of the camera lens into the audience itself. Does she want us to reflect back what she once was or what she will be? Im not sure even Pfeiffer knows.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Share Tweet Overall Cheri is less like a film than like the experience of sitting in on a picture-book reading in the childrens room of the local library. Granted the subject matter--sex doomed love and the gradual death of the body and soul--isnt appropriate childrens literature. (Itd probably win a Newbery though.) But nothing about Stephen Frears first film since 2006s stellar The Queen has the dynamism of cinema. The characters--a circle of fabulously wealthy courtesans and companions in Belle Epoque Paris and environs--lounge preen banter and pose in a succession of airless tableaux. Meanwhile a warmly paternal narrator fills in their backstories and explains their every action. Still the picture-book treatment is faithful to the source material an airy dry 1920 comic novel by celebrated French writer Colette. The books action is just as minimal and obsessed with surfaces as Frears presents it An aging courtesan (Michelle Pfeiffer) launches a lengthy affair with a petulant selfish beautiful 19-year-old (Rupert Friend). Then his duplicitous mother (an oddly cast but agreeably lively Kathy Bates) arranges his marriage to a suitable girl and the lovers dutifully part ways but continue to pine for each other. Their relationship seems based more on convenience and novelty than love but once forced apart they examine their lives for the first time with devastating consequences. Theres a little love and a lot of lust in this scenario but the only real action comes when fleeting regrets and resolves chase each other across the leads expressive faces or when someone lets selfish pique erupt into a brief tantrum. And yet Cheri is far from dull thanks in particular to Pfeiffers languorously nuanced performance as a striking beauty whose dalliance with a boy first flatters her then makes her feel her age and the emptiness of her fiercely independent life. The films tacked-on ending is taken from Colettes 1926 Cheri sequel but otherwise it contains none of the sequels eventual vindication of her characters choices; instead the film is a sumptuous handsome portrait of a woman poised fearfully on the brink of decline yet too proud to grab at rescue. The Queen was a similarly staid analysis of a woman coming to terms with endings but it dealt with weighty affairs of state; Cheri instead is a minor story about romance among the spoiled rich. But it also harkens back to an earlier Frears success 1998s Dangerous Liaisons another film about shallow idlers who dabble in relationships and wind up in over their heads.

"Cheri | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cheri ) Cheri (United Kingdom/Germany 2009) June 23 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Watching Cheri I felt like someone had turned back the clock by about 15 years. The early-to-mid-1990s were a fertile time for literate lavish adaptations of period piece literature with frequent destinations being Europe between the early-1800s and the mid-1900s. Cheri based on the novel by Colette (actually two novels Cheri and Le Fin de Cheri) would have been perfectly at home amidst the stately company of Merchant-Ivory Scorseses The Age of Innocence and the endless adaptations of Jane Austen novels. Considering the screenwriter this should not be a surprise. Christopher Hampton has made a living out of plundering the past with titles like Dangerous Liaisons and Carrington on his resume. And while Cheri is not in the same league as either of those giants it is a respectable and satisfying historical romantic melodrama. The film opens in the early 1900s an era in which elite courtesans wielded great power in Parisian society. One of those is Lea de Lonval (Michelle Pfeiffer) whose dalliances with influential clients are legendary. She becomes involved with Cheri (Rupert Friend) the son of a fellow professional Madame Perloux (Kathy Bates). Their relationship - initially intended to be a fling - turns into a six-year affair that ends only when Madame Perloux arranges for Cheri to marry Edmee (Felicity Jones) the 18-year old daughter of another courtesan. Once divided by necessity Lea and Cheri discover that staying apart is more difficult than either of them expected and despite making valiant attempts to move on they find themselves drawn back together like moths to flames. Hamptons screenplay does an effective job of mixing the storys core romantic longing with a lighter more deft touch. The latter is especially evident in an acerbic voiceover and it also makes itself felt in the occasional witty one-liners that are flung back-and-forth in conversation. At its breeziest Cheri recalls Easy Virtue (in large part because the two are reaching theaters in close proximity) although of course no one would confuse Noel Coward with Colette. Still theres enough levity here to keep proceedings from descending into a period soap opera. The resolution which is expressed to the audience by the narrator lands like a sledgehammer and left me feeling that it deserved more than the few sentences it is accorded. The romance is as competently realized as any doomed love affair. It equalizes the protagonists screen time by showing how each copes with the forced break-up. The story is told economically; there arent many surprises but theres an emotional honesty to how the character arcs are represented. Cheri relies upon viewer empathy with the lovers. The movie is about the pain and uncertainty that results when circumstances separate those who believe they belong together and how no amount of self-deception can assuage the ache. Because loss is central to the theme theres something universal about what Cheri has to say; it speaks even to those who have not been forced by family or society to repress emotions for ""the good of all involved."" Cheri isnt heavy on social commentary but neither is it entirely devoid of it. The film is openly critical of the tenets of society that force people apart because their interaction is deemed undesirable. More subtly it addresses the current stigma attached to sexual liaisons between younger men and older women by making it a non-issue. No one in Cheri ever remarks upon the age gap between Cheri who is 25 and Lea who is 49. Within French society of the Belle Epoque such things were accepted in ways that are not necessarily the case today. (In fact the one instance in which an age difference is remarked upon is when Cheri questions the seven-year difference between himself and his wife who is 18.) Likewise the ability of high-end prostitutes to wield power and command respect may seem to be a strange thing in a culture in which the ""worlds oldest profession"" has been marginalized and made illegal in so many countries and territories. Theres a mismatch in the level of performances provided by the leads. Michelle Pfeiffer who has largely fallen by the wayside since her popularity peaked in the late-1980s and early-1990s (Hollywoods tendency to discard women over 35 for roles of substance has something to do with this) shows that her recent low profile has not diminished her acting ability. Physical beauty may have been the reason for her early popularity but she has developed into an effective and nuanced actress. Sadly Rupert Friend is not her equal. His performance captures the petulance we are supposed to associate with Cheri but it is otherwise flat and lacking in charisma. Cheris screen time may roughly equal Leas but the strength of Pfeiffers portrayal when compared to Friends tilts the balance toward the woman. Kathy Bates is a scene-stealing supporting player in part because she has many of the best one-liners. Despite its occasional missteps like the weakness of Friends interpretation of the title character Cheri is an engaging romantic melodrama that provides an authentic sense of time and place. The production values are impeccable and the director and screenplay place us in the midst of the crisis (rather than observing as outsiders) a perspective that adds resonance. Although not as good as some of the great period pieces of 15-20 years ago its solid enough not to cause embarrassment by the association.

As for casting Pfeiffer as a woman on the wrong side of youth You need someone who has been one of the great beauties of the world and is still beautiful says the director. She was very courageous about it. (June 26) (Bruno Calvo / Miramax Films) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Shes a leading Paris courtesan that high-class brand of prostitute that had its heyday before the telephone created ""call girls.""He is the son of a friend a vain pretty-boy given to ""debauchery"" -- wine women and opium.She knew him as a child and was the one who gave him the nickname Cheri. He grew up calling her ""Noo Noon."" And even though she is ""of a certain age"" and contemplating retirement he is smitten or as close to smitten as he allows. Cheri based on a novel by the French writer Colette is a sumptuous but only rarely romantic romance set in France during the belle epoque just before World War I. Despite having Michelle Pfeiffer playing Lea a fading beauty in all her self-aware glory Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liaisons) loses himself in the dazzling dresses and stunning hats and loses the sting of a failed romance the longing of a lovesick older woman the callow youth who comes to realize the love he has lost.The wit comes from the inversion of the characters -- the 50ish woman who doesnt draw the stares that her absurdly pretty 19-year-old toy boy (Rupert Friend of Pride amp; Prejudice) does. The storys sting is in the defense mechanisms they both employ. Hes been a wastrel and being the son of retired courtesan Charlotte ( Kathy Bates well cast) has no morals or scruples. Lea has always taken lovers who could afford to support her. Until Cheri. But Mother Charlotte wants grandchildren and arranges a suitable marriage for Cheri. Will their feelings finally come out?Friend is all hair and cleft chin and pout here a blank slate. But hes Twilight gorgeous so much so that youd swear its not makeup or lighting that makes Pfeiffer blush. The two dont have a lot of chemistry and while each is adept at getting across that subtle suggestion of ""Im not going to give in to love"" they dont give us any emotional release when they do give in.Thus Frears and his Liaisons screenwriter Christopher Hampton give us a period piece in which the settings are fab but the liaisons arent dangerous or even romantic.

Stephen Frearss anemic adaptation written by Christopher Hampton (who also folds in 1926s The Last of Cheri) would most likely make the author nod off or plug her ears. Cheri the most celebrated of Colettes male characters is a louche 19-year-old millionaire played by Rupert Friend acting opposite Michelle Pfeiffer as Lea a courtesan dun certain age who has a six-year affair with the insolent androgyne until hes married off. Frears and Hamptons missteps begin immediately with the director providing pinched narration as he recounts over so many cartes de visite the histories of other famous ladies who made a handsome living on their backs. Its the first of innumerable auditory assaults continuing with Alexandre Desplats frantic score and the clash of English and American accents (especially puzzling in the scenes with Brit Friend and Kathy Bates as his retired-prostie mother). Pfeiffer uncertain how to convey the older wiser erotomane resorts to sounding like Samantha Jones auditioning for Masterpiece Theater her decolletage the only part of this movie getting any air.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Explosive Material Visceral and addictive The Hurt Locker is one hell of a war film. Plus Agnes Vardas enchanting memoir. _ By David Edelstein Published Jun 22 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Summit Entertainment) Among director Kathryn Bigelows many gifts is the ability to make men feel penis envy. Thats the theme (and sly joke) of her melodrama Blue Steel in which a male bystander watches a female cop blast a robber into oblivion and covets her phallic power. Pity the movie is so ham-handed and that Bigelows rollicking existential surfer thriller Point Break ends up drowning in grandiose machismo. But in her smashing Baghdad drama The Hurt Locker Bigelow makes the Olympian leap into the mindand circulatory systemof the male warrior. Her voice is attuned to men under threat from all angles; and the men their weapons cocked are attuned to everythinga squeak a pop a wire snaking out from under a mound of debris. The Hurt Locker might be the first Iraq-set film to break through to a mass audience because it doesnt lead with the paralysis of the guilt-ridden Yank. The horror is there but under the rush. One of Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boals few missteps comes right at the start an onscreen quote from journalist Chris Hedges to the effect that war is a drug a potent and often lethal addiction. The quote is brilliant subversive to the pointand pins down the thesis too much. It robs us of the chance to frame that idea for ourselves. The Hurt Locker is otherwise unhinged. The film revolves around the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit a bomb squad that shows up to dismantle devices of varying degrees of sophistication and deadliness. After an overture in which a cautious sergeant goes bye-bye his replacement shows up Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) a Zen cowboy who strides up to potential IEDs in a way that makes you yelp either What a suicidal motherf-----  or That is some hot shit A colonel (David Morse) repeats the latter like a hosanna but Sergeant J. T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) working under James thinks hes dangerousa cock-of-the-walk on a walk off a cliff. BACKSTORY The Hurt Locker star Jeremy Renner says the title of film took on different meanings over the course of the shoot. At first it represented the threat of death and he thought of it as a casket. Later on he says it became a physical place because we had one outhouse for 250 people and we were all getting sick Id say I have to go to the hurt locker.  Finally it became this spiritual place of anguish he says. It was 125 degrees the bomb suit was 100 pounds. By the end we were completely stripped of our dignity and self-respect. After returning to California he says I was in a kind of spiritual hurt locker for three months. A bomb squad in a war zone presents dizzying variables Each time out James has a new puzzle to solve (Wheres the trigger? Is there a timer or are insurgents standing by with a button to push?) while Sanborn and the jittery specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) pirouette and focus and refocus their sights Young man at nine oclock holding a video camera. Three guys at six oclock. Cell phone (the last a potential detonator). Do you shoot them? Shoot into windows with kids nearby? Boal a journalist suggests what other scriptwriters havent that civilians can go bonkers from the pressure toofreezing in their cars or striding up to overanxious troops with idiotic pleasantries. (Where are you fromCalifornia?) Bigelow cinematographer Barry Ackroyd and editors Chris Innis and Bob Murawski form a crack unit of their own. There are sudden camera moves cuts a beat too quick and jumps from close-up to long shot that signal explosions are imminenteven when theyre not. Here is how I knew I was inside the movie. Under fire his weapon jammed from the sticky blood of its last operator James screams at Eldridge to clean the blood off the bullets and panicky Eldridge yells How? and James says Salivaand I found myself building up spit as if maybe I could help before the next onslaught. Even with the kicky technique and violent macho horseplay (in between missions the comrades-in-arms pummel one another) The Hurt Locker wouldnt click without characters of stature and actors to match. Renner has the wit to internalize Jamess hot-dog tendenciesto make him less not more theatrical with no wasted motion. (James wouldnt be much good defusing bombs if given to flamboyant gestures.) Mackie doesnt play Sanborn as a by-the-book killjoy but a man whod take honest joy in killing Jameswho does at times pose a threat to the units safety. Geraghtys Eldridge is an unholy mess wholly reactive and therefore undefended. A few name actorsmost memorably Ralph Fiennes as a brusque seasoned contract soldierpop up and go out with shocking speed. Normal movie-star rules are suspended. Its only after The Hurt Locker ends and your fight-or-flight instincts ebb that the flaws seem more apparent like the too-pat subplot about a kind but glib therapist (Christian Camargo) who decides to get out from behind the wire and go on a mission. The final shot though thrilling puts too fine a point on things. Last but maybe foremost are the politicsor lack of them. The question of what the hell these good men are doing in a culture they dont understand with a language they dont speak surrounded by people they cant read hangs in the air but is never actually called. Or is that why this movie rises above its preachy counterparts? Bigelows triumph is to show why they dont call that into question themselves. Shes deep inside their testosterone-soaked psyches where why has no meaning and sensation is all. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Its a shame given the splendour on offer Michelle Pfeiffer is magnificently attired in a series of to-die-for Grecian bended period costumes playing successful well-mannered courtesan Lea who embarks on a six-year protective relationship with callow Cheri (Rupert Friend) the kohl-eyed son of a colleague shed nurtured and nicknamed as a boy. At 19 he presents the perfect picture of self-loathing dissolution that we associate with the world of Oscar Wilde. The film is a sober portrait of unconventional love and restrained suffering - punctured by a moment of explicit wailing arch-backed pain - that may be undone by its discretion and quiet irony. If Pfeiffer is occasionally touching - hauling back her emotions when caught off-guard - then Friend doing a passable impression of Terence Stamp in his beauteous youth is too passive an object to be truly moving. His crucial marriage of convenience to fellow orphan Edmee (Felicity Jones) makes him as much a cipher as an emotional victim of the veiled hypocritical and corrupt machinery of capitalist business the book and film seek to expose and criticise. Indeed Frears who also supplies a knowing narration is content to leave much of the films metaphor to exquisite architecture and design notably the exotic perfumed gardens of Cheris mothers grand house in Neuilly where Lea repeatedly recalls her halcyon days with the boy only compounding an impression of the film as a mere picture-book remembrance.

Perhaps you could go watch it for that?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/86671/ch-ri.html,200,cheri30,cheri,timeout
