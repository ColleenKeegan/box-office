Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) a lobbyist for the tobacco industry is pitching Jeff (Rob Lowe) a Hollywood super-agent who never sleeps on bringing cigarettes back to the movies. Jeff envisions a science-fiction romance where Catherine Zeta-Jones and Brad Pitt light up in space -- in between ravishing each others naked bodies that is. Nick likes the idea except for one problem ""Wouldnt they blow up in an all-oxygen environment?"" Jeff is prepared for this question. ""Its an easy fix"" he says. ""One line of dialogue Thank god we invented the... whatever... device.""""Star Trek Beyond"" is a movie full of whatever devices where an outdated ship that crash-landed on a hostile planet a century ago can be easily fixed up with a little TLC and an attack of killer bees is neutralized by blasting the Beastie Boys. The films own logic is so casually convoluted that like Ellen Page in ""Inception"" the characters have a way of narrating the action to the audience just to make sure youre following along. (You still may not be.)""Beyond"" is the first ""Star Trek"" film to be penned by Simon Pegg who co-wrote the cult comedy Cornetto Trilogy (""The Worlds End"" ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"") with his frequent collaborator Edgar Wright. Peggs script is a nonsense but it is a spirited one the closest in tone of the recent trilogy to the original ""Star Trek"" series. Created by Gene Roddenberry the show was expansive with ideas about mans existential fate and subsequent installments only expounded on its philosophical optimism. ""It is the struggle itself that is most important"" waxes Data in ""The Next Generation."" ""We must strive to be more than we are. It does not matter that we will not reach our ultimate goal. The effort itself yields its own reward.""At the opening of ""Beyond"" a sense of fatigue has set in over the Enterprise and perhaps the films themselves. Kirk (Chris Pine) now three years into his mission to explore the vast recesses of the galaxy tells his captains log that the infinitum of space is both beautiful and despairing While it means anything is possible the indistinguishable days turn punishing. ""Things have started to feel a little episodic"" Kirk bemoans in a strong monologue thats often quite pretty.That kind of self-referential humor permeates ""Beyond"" directed by Justin Lin (""Fast Five"") with a sense of rollicking adventure missing from the previous entry ""Into Darkness"" weighed down by dour ballast. ""Star Trek Beyond"" more than anything is designed as a course-correct from the previous film. ""Into Darkness"" was hampered by its own super-seriousness and an Uhura-Spock romance that felt ripped from a Katherine Heigl movie but ""Beyond"" focuses on the real romance of ""Star Trek"" -- the relationships between its crew members.Spock (Zachary Quinto) following the destruction of his homeland is contemplating leaving the Enterprise to carry on the work of the recently-deceased Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy) his alter-ego from another universe. But as his team reminds him Spock is needed on the ship -- especially by Kirk who wouldnt be able to function without his right-hand man. You Might Also Like The fraternal banter between the Enterprise crew is the films strongest aspect reminiscent of the jocular energy of Peggs earlier screenplays. After Spock decides to part ways with Uhura he gives her a necklace as a token of his affection. He refuses to take it back saying it would be against Vulcan custom. It turns out that the stone embedded in the jewelry is not only radioactive but easy to detect via the ships scanners. ""You gave your girlfriend a tracking device?"" Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) concludes. Spock might be appalled by the suggestion but he cant fault the validity of the doctors logic. ""Beyond"" undercuts the unfortunate sexism of the previous entry (why did Carol take off her shirt again?) by giving the series its best female character in ages Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) a warrior who seeks vengeance for her people. She also lacks an understanding of basic social graces. Sporting an accent straight out of ""The Fifth Element"" Jaylah repeatedly refers to Capt. Kirk as ""James T"" and sits in his chair -- feet up -- without asking. Charmingly unpredictable shes my kind of vigilante.Jaylah will get her chance at revenge when the Enterprise is attacked by Krall a tyrannical despot who commands a swarm of mechanical bees to attack the ship. Like the trio of vampyric models in Nicolas Winding Refns ""The Neon Demon"" Krall feasts on the young in his quest for immortal life. He purges the Enterprise of its crew who will be taken hostage and harvested. Krall is played by Idris Elba one of the finest actors of his generation. You might remember him from Cary Joji Fukunagas ""Beasts of No Nation"" or ""The Wire"" where he portrays a warlord and a gangster respectively. Both of these men prey on youth in different ways. The Commandant needs child soldiers for his army while Stringer Bell relies on truant teenagers to run his drug enterprise. While Elba a fearsome and volatile presence adds dramatic heft to the role he is wasted underneath pounds of prosthetics that make him look like Ivan Ooze. (Bryan Singers most recent ""X-Men"" film shared this issue.) The actor is virtually unrecognizable until the final third where he is finally unmasked.""Beyond"" is undoubtedly messy like a Starfleet ship thats taken its fair share of beatings but it is frequently a reminder of how good the series can be when all its engines are in working order. Opening a box left behind by Commander Spock Spock the younger finds a photo of the original crew. That nostalgia both for its source material and time gone by is both reverent and earned. Given the losses of both Nimoy and Anton Yelchin who plays Chekhov since the previous feature its hard not to share the films wonder as the destiny that awaits us all.The film may not go boldly but its a welcome homecoming for the beloved series.

Comments (6) Star Trek Beyond New Video Rated PG-13  122 minutes  2016 J.J. Abrams who directed Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) has beamed up to the ship leaving us stranded on the planets surface with Fast and the Furious auteur Justin Lin. This third installment in the millennial Star Trek reboot races along without an idea in its head often recalling the silly monster-driven final season of the 60s TV show. (Among the screenwriters is Simon Pegg who plays Mr. Scott onscreen but also scripted such lowbrow favorites as Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead.) The 2009 movie held out the promise that the familiar old characters might be taken in new directions but Lin makes good on that only once with a blink-and-youll-miss-it shot of Mr. Sulu meeting his gay lover on shore leave; needless to say theres plenty of stale comedy between the obtuse Mr. Spock and irascible Dr. McCoy.

Kirk (Chris Pine) as he surveys life aboard the USS Enterprise early in Justin Lins diverting self-aware Star Trek Beyond every day the same uniform from the same closet the same coffee in the same mug the same chair on the same bridge the wonders of the interstellar far reaches blurring by the viewport at warp speed. Co-written by Simon Pegg Beyond goes where the decades-old Star Trek franchise has gone many times before--following another distress call to another away mission to confront another bad guy with a secret past and a monologue on another planet that looks like its made of spray-painted foam--but this time with a wink. Star Treks ideal medium has always been TV where personalities could develop individually. But the crew of the rebooted big-screen Enterprise cant make the time to change which is why they can always rely on each other opines Beyond. Bringing some of the physics-defying action of Lins Fast amp; Furious sequels (and somehow a motorcycle chase) into futuristic space the movie finds the Enterprise flying into a trap laid by Krall (Idris Elba unrecognizable) whose drone army attacks the starship breaking it up into pieces. The basic outline of Star Trek Beyond bears a passing resemblance to one of Pegg and Edgar Wrights paeans to friendship in the face of Armageddon Bored stiff on their five-year mission the crew thinks of nothing but the moment theyll get to finally leave the Enterprise only to have it snatched away in an instant; separated in pairs they venture from their escape pods to start over in a long-lost century-old Starfleet vessel that was ditched on the surface of the unknown planet saving the day to get back to where they started but with a newfound sense of purpose.The drone attack in which the familiar interior corridors of the Enterprise become twisted and punctured as the camera weaves in and out of holes in its hull also gives the movie its most memorable image Kirk his face reflected in the window of an escape pod taking one last look at the bridge before rocketing away to watch the Enterprises wreckage crash in flames into an alien terrain. From here on out the crew members have to rely on their supplies of can-do spirit and pithy one-liners and on their limited intractable personas Kirk the one who gets to use his fists; pointy-eared Spock (Zachary Quinto) the one whos very serious; Uhura (Zoe Saldana) the one who has the patience of a saint; Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin) the one whos always yelling; Bones (Karl Urban) the one who has all the best jokes; Sulu (John Cho) the one who never gets anything to do but still seems like a cool guy; Scotty (Pegg) the one whos Scottish.The great Star Trek antagonists are negative mirror images of the Enterprise and the group-effort cause of the Federation (the collectivist Borg the totalitarian Romulans etc.) and in that regard Krall has all the making of a perfect villain though explaining why would constitute a major spoiler. Yet his motivations get only a cursory exploration; though in many ways a corrective to its predecessor Star Trek Into Darkness Beyond pushes Star Trek even further away from being a franchise of ideas. With Lin at the helm and the Enterprise crew reimagined as a family unit in the mold of Dom Torettos gang the movie bounces along hurtling its heroes over colliding wreckage and into currents of artificial gravity pausing just long enough for a punchline or a knowing exchange of looks.

The third chapter in the rebooted Star Trek franchise with J.J. Abrams ceding the captains chair to Justin Lin is plenty fast and furious (Lin directed four of those adrenalized Famp;F babies). But it also openly gives its heart to what came before; any Trekkie that doesnt choke up at this 50th-anniversary edition is no longer in the club. Feelings run deep stemming from the death last year of original Spock Leonard Nimoy at 83 and for Anton Yelchin as the Russian navigator Chekov who died last month at 27 in a tragic accident. The movie is rightly dedicated to both of them. Related Summer Movie Preview 2016 Attack of the Blockbuster Clones Superheroes supervillains sequels semi-reboots -- the scoop on the seasons surprisingly familiar multiplex stunners And quite a movie it is. Playing like a mega-budgeted episode of the Gene Roddenberry TV series that took the time to develop characters Star Trek Beyond may be hell on short attention spans. But patience and faith yield surprising dividends. The movie finds both Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) in a thoughtful mode In the middle of a five-year tour for the Federation Kirk wonders if he wants to be promoted to Vice-Admiral. Hed rather the job went to Spock whos thinking -- after the death of Spock Prime (Nimoy) and his breakup with Uhura (Zoe Saldana) -- that he should turn away from his human side and go back to Vulcan to start a family there. (Survival of the species and all that.) Kudos to Pine and Quinto who bring new depth and feeling to their roles.Dont worry The angst evaporates when the Starship Enterprise gets attacked. Screenwriters Doug Jung and Simon Pegg who plays Scotty know the rules of engagement. While docking at the utopian spaceport of Yorktown where alien cultures live in harmony and Sulu (John Cho) shares a hug with his husband and their daughter (yes hes gay even if the original Sulu George Takei himself gay doesnt like it) the Enterprise is sent on a rescue mission that turns into an ambush. An enemy horde led by the fearsome Krall (Idris Elba) blows the Enterprise to pieces leaving the crew separated and stranded on the alien planet of Altamid.Thats the setup which allows for some playful pairings. Spock and Bones (Karl Urban terrific) snipe at each other hilariously. Kirk and Chekov (damn that Yelchin is good) set out to rescue the captured Uhura and Sulu. And Scotty matches wits with Jaylah (a scene-stealing Sofia Boutella from Kingsman The Secret Service) an alien notorious for her white-and-black warpaint attitude for days and combat skills accentuated by a trove of old-ass music called rap (""I like the beats and the screaming""). Scotty calls this dynamo ""lassie."" He would.Those are a lot of plot points to juggle. Luckily Lin doesnt drop too many balls and the actors dont just go through the motions. Elba makes a fierce villain even when mostly buried under layers of prosthetics. (Why are we doing this to many of our best most expressive actors? Look at Tom Hardy in The Dark Knight Rises and Oscar Isaac in X-Men Apocalypse. Its like acting with a paper bag over your head. Elba can do it -- he can do anything -- but its a trend Id like to see fade.)Lin pulls out all the VFX stops in the final siege at Yorktown a sequence that shatters the rafters. Yet Star Trek Beyond manages to knock you for a bigger loop with just the sight of one man staring at a photograph. Youll know it the moment you see it. Come to Star Trek Beyond for the pow; stay for the emotional wipeout.

By Anthony Lane The latest ""Trek"" film directed by Justin Lin and written by Doug Jung and Simon Pegg is a blast alive to the comic awesomeness of being lost in space.   Credit Illustration by Vincent Mahe Barely half an hour has passed in ""Star Trek Beyond"" and the USS Enterprise is already getting a haircut. First of all its main thrusters are sheared off which must--though Im no expert--spell trouble for the warp drive and then the tubular body drops away leaving only the central saucer. In short everybodys favorite spacecraft has just turned into one big galactic Frisbee. Theres a wonderful shot of Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) safe in his ejection pod gazing through the windshield at the flaming corpse of his beloved ship which plunges down toward the crags of an unwelcoming planet. Even agnostics unmoved by the remorseless reboots of the ""Star Trek"" franchise may find themselves mourning the loss. On the other hand it does give Kirk a dose of pep and purpose. At the start of the film on his nine hundred and sixty-sixth day in deep space he quietly confesses that ""things have started to feel episodic."" Were with you Jim especially those of us who are now sitting down to our thirteenth ""Star Trek"" movie. Kirk is mulling over a promotion to a grander but flightless role while Spock (Zachary Quinto) has career plans of his own possibly connected to the cooling of his relationship with Lieutenant Uhura (Zoe Saldana). That she might ever tire of making out with a Vulcan sounds illogical but the heart has its reasons even in zero gravity. To be honest the whole darn crew seems frayed so its something of a blessing--or at any rate a bonding exercise--when the Enterprise traversing a distant nebula to rescue a stranded vessel is peppered and pulled apart. Earlier Kirk had described the mission as ""straightforward"" but then though indubitably the bravest of commanders he was never really the brightest. Even now a trace of the eager rube still clings to him and his idea of a helpful stunt at a critical point in the film is to mount an old motorcycle light-years from Earth and gun it straight at the enemy. The villain of the piece is Krall (Idris Elba) who like the majority of life-forms in the ""Star Trek"" universe just happens to be a biped of roughly human stature with a good working grasp of colloquial English. There is no reason that a major character couldnt be shaped like a lamprey visible only in infrared or a cloud of noble gas but I suppose casting agents might object. Krall is one of those acquisitive fellows like Sauron in ""The Lord of the Rings"" whose happiness will not be complete until he gets his mitts on a particular doodad. In Kralls case it is the Abronath which is not a Scottish fishing town but the key as so often to ultimate power. What I like most about Krall is his squadron of attack ships--spiky little critters that swarm through the interstellar vacuum like starlings cavorting and swaying this way and that. Such is the surprise that is sprung by the latest film its not just a blast but at moments a thing of beauty alive to the comic awesomeness of being lost in space. Did Kirk ever dream that he would slide down the outside of the Enterprise as it keels over firing his phaser upward at the bridge? He is dwarfed by the immensity of his craft which itself is reduced to a mere sliver near the beginning of the film when it docks at Yorkville--a planet-size base that hangs in the heavens like a Christmas bauble with inverted boulevards and skyscrapers curving around inside. Written by Doug Jung and Simon Pegg who stars once more as Scotty and directed by Justin Lin ""Star Trek Beyond"" refuses to be sidetracked by solemnity--the besetting sin of some previous installments. Apart from a few brief lectures on the relative merits of unity (good) and conflict (bad) the story skirts past lulls and doldrums unveils a sprightly new heroine named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) and lays out the set pieces in Kirks words ""the old-fashioned way."" The best of these arrives when Kirk and his team engage Kralls fleet not with quantum torpedoes but with a cranked-up blast of the Beastie Boys. So its official in space everyone can hear you scream. When did you last see a film with a lengthy conversation at its heart? There is Louis Malles ""My Dinner with Andre"" (1981) and before that Eric Rohmers ""My Night at Mauds"" (1969) in which a man stays over with a beautiful woman; being French they spend so long discussing love desire and Catholic philosophy that despite being French they never get around to having sex. Then there is Christoph Waltz as the smiling Nazi of ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009) and the leisurely chats that he enjoys--one in a cafe in front of a strudel with whipped cream and another at a kitchen table. In truth they are more like soliloquies and because this is a Quentin Tarantino movie the talk is booby-trapped; you sense that violent action is primed to explode. But what if there were no action--or rather if talk were action with the words bursting like shells in our ears? That is the case with James Schamuss ""Indignation"" and in particular with one volatile exchange. It occurs at Winesburg College in Ohio between a freshman named Marcus Messner (Logan Lerman) and Hawes Caudwell (Tracy Letts) a domineering figure in a solid blue suit who as dean of the college must be amply acquainted with every strain of turpitude among his charges. But what is the problem with Marcus? Bright industrious and undebauched he seems a model student--a working-class Jewish kid from New Jersey who came to Winesburg on a scholarship. Something about him however needles the dean. Marcus has failed to join a Jewish fraternity and now abraded by his roommates he has moved to another dormitory and to a room of his own. What Caudwell wonders is How can you hope to get on in life if you dont get on with folks? And so the back-and-forth begins to swell. Minor differences of opinion turn into perspiring rants from Marcus and counterattacks laced with condescension from the dean. His efforts to defuse the mood with praise--""You are destined to be an outstanding lawyer""--serve only to heighten Marcuss resentment. Part duel part duet the scene lasts sixteen minutes and concludes not with a resolving chord but in a spasm of bile. The story springs of course from a book by Philip Roth. He is the laureate of bridling and ""Indignation"" published in 2008 is as much a study in mulishness as ""Portnoys Complaint"" from 1969. Roths landscape is pitted and rutted where people have dug in their hooves and refused to budge whatever the cost may be; and in ""Indignation"" the cost could scarcely be more severe. The time is 1951 and one reason that Marcuss mother Esther (Linda Emond) and his father a butcher named Max (Danny Burstein) are not just proud of their son but relieved by his academic prowess is that most of his pals deprived of his opportunities have been drafted to serve in Korea. To put the matter starkly if you dont study you could die and we see Marcus before he sets off for Winesburg attending the funeral of a friend. This air of momentousness pervades every deed in Schamuss film. Take Marcuss first date with Olivia Hutton (Sarah Gadon)--fair immaculate and at first blush unapproachable. They have dinner at a fancy French place after which in the front seat of a car she does all the approaching that Marcus could ever wish for. But note their surroundings the car is parked by a cemetery and the heros innocence is lost among the dead. Also Olivia herself has been in the wars. At another college before Winesburg she tried to kill herself and bears a scar to prove it. The finest moment of the film comes when Esther Messner travels to Winesburg to see her son who has just had an emergency appendectomy. In the hospital she meets Olivia (who has aided the patients recovery with a Rothian flourish by jerking him off under the bedclothes) and the two women swap pleasantries. In one short closeup however we see Olivias scar and we see that Esther has seen it too. Later she cautions Marcus against having anything to do with a girl who has slit her wrists. It was only one wrist he protests. ""One is enough"" she says. The words are delivered as if being graven in stone. Linda Emond is magnificent in the scene leonine in her protectiveness yet remaining perfectly calm. Together with Tracy Letts who brings to Caudwell both a dash of amusement and a will of iron Emond presents ""Indignation"" with a snag the senior actors are tougher than their juniors. Logan Lerman is endearing finding shyness as well as bluster in the hero (when discomposed he turns aside and narrows his eyes like Richard Gere) and Sarah Gadon has the look of an injured angel but the movie simply asks too much of them. Also some of their chatter--not filtered through Marcuss narration as it is on the page but delivered straight--has a half-archaic stiffness (""I who have eight thousand moods a minute"" Olivia says) and that lack of pliability extends to the entire tale. Schamus is a great producer of independent cinema having overseen--and sometimes co-written--the work of Ang Lee but this is the first movie he has directed and the rhythm of the storytelling feels careful and courteous to a fault. Yet Marcuss plight is genuinely grave and Schamus sets up delicate visual rhymes that are not in Roth the roses on Olivias print skirt for instance match the ones that she takes to the hospital and the wallpaper that we see at the beginning and at the end of the film. In memory such flowers never lose their bloom; in Ohio or Korea though young lives wilt fade and get thrown away.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

"Star Trek Beyond | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; star-trek-beyond ) Star Trek Beyond (United States 2016) July 22 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Note This review contains minor spoilers although nothing that cant be gleaned from watching the trailers. Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie although not an especially good one. Although that description might sound self-evident there was concern within the Star Trek fan base that the selection of Justin ""Fast and Furious"" Lin might move Beyond too far from its roots. Without a doubt Lin has changed things - the movies look is radically different with an abundant use of shaky-cam shots and dizzying quick edits. The action sequences are frenetic kinetic and at times incoherent. This isnt unexpected; its Lins trademark. But the plot credited to Simon Pegg amp; Doug Jung is pure Trek. Unfortunately its also instantly forgettable. Comparing Beyond to past movies (there are 13 others out there) this one comes closest in approach to installments 5 (The Final Frontier) and 9 (Insurrection). Like Beyond those films were reasonably self-contained supersized TV episodes. They werent ""event"" movies or parts of larger story arcs. They would have been well-received as made-for-TV movies but didnt pass muster as major motion pictures. Despite action and visuals that are an order or magnitude better than either The Final Frontier or Insurrection Beyond feels like a lesser effort. Its more ""Spocks Brain"" than ""The City on the Edge of Forever."" Lins mandate one assumes was to continue J.J. Abrams mission to make Star Trek mainstream. Although Abrams Trek may have been influenced by Star Wars Lin draws more from Guardians of the Galaxy. Pegg and Jungs screenplay which amps up the humor considerably from the tonally glum Star Trek Into Darkness is complicit in this. No previous Star Trek movie has boasted visual effects this special - the craft evident in creating the Yorktown Starbase takes the movie where no Trek movie has gone before. The devastating attack on the Enterprise is impressive although the ship took almost as bad a bad pummeling in Star Trek Into Darkness. Its final fate echoes The Search for Spock and Generations although without much of an emotional impact. This Enterprise has always felt more like a prop than a character. It hasnt been around long enough to win our affection. Pegg amp; Jungs script which picks up three years into the five-year mission seems designed more as a means for getting action and character vignettes on screen than providing viewers with a compelling narrative. It can be summed up succinctly as Big Bad Guy with alien prosthetics destroys the Enterprise as step 1 in an attack against the Federation and its up to Kirk amp; co. to stop him before he launches the final assault. Subplots involve Kirk (Chris Pine) wondering whether he wants to continue as a starship captain Spock (Zachary Quinto) pondering going to new Vulcan and helping to repopulate the species and McCoy (Karl Urban) providing comic relief. Unsurprisingly Scotty (Pegg) has more screen time than in the previous movies showing his miracle worker abilities and bonding with a black-and-white warrior woman alien Jaylah (Sofia Boutella). Sulu (John Cho) Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin) are given more to do than in either 2009s Star Trek or its first follow-up but theyre still mostly in the background. The Star Trek movies have a history of using strong actors as villains. The Wrath of Khan established the template with Ricardo Montalban. Christopher Plummer came on board for The Undiscovered Country. Malcolm McDowell F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hardy followed. Abrams used Eric Bana and Benedict Cumberbatch. Now Idris Elba has joined the Star Trek family. Unfortunately buried under all the prosthetics he might as well be some extra pulled off the street. This is an unforgivable underuse of talent. Krall is a weak villain with an underwhelming motivation. The build-up to revelations about his past one of the movies hooks doesnt have a satisfying payoff. Members of the ""new"" crew who have now been involved in the series for three movies over seven years are still growing into their roles. The camaraderie in the Kirk/Spock/McCoy trio is more natural in Beyond than in either Star Trek or Into Darkness and for the first time Pegg doesnt seem horribly miscast as Scotty. Saldanas Uhura remains a beacon of class and strength but Im not sold on either Cho or Yelchin. Long-time Trek fans can be excused if they still see these second-generation replacements as imposters. In an era when none other than J.J. Abrams (with The Force Awakens) showcased the enduring power of nostalgia its odd that no attempt was made to involve any of the surviving original Star Trek actors in this production. Perhaps the best moment in Beyond involves a short but moving tribute to the seven original actors. The strength of that moment (and the way the playing of the original theme continues to elevate the emotional pulse) hints at missed opportunities. Skyfall gave Bond fans a fitting 50th anniversary celebration; its too bad that Beyond doesnt replicate the experience for Star Trek loyalists. Then again the cinematic landscape has changed. Original fans are grandparents many in their late 60s and 70s (not in their 30s as when The Motion Picture opened). Except in isolated pockets the passion isnt there anymore. That more than anything is the reason why todays Star Trek has become plot-light and spectacle-heavy. Star Trek Beyond can stand toe-to-toe with any of 2016s big-budget blockbusters. When it comes to visual razzle-dazzle and directorial chicanery it has nothing to be ashamed of. But as is often the case those things mask deficiencies in the story. Forgive me for wondering exactly where ""beyond"" is taking us and whether ultimately the trek will be worth it.

Kimberly French/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Star Trek How well do you know the Trek universe? Monitor Movie Guide The consistently entertaining ""Star Trek Beyond"" directed by Justin Lin gives a good name to franchise fodder. The Star Trek movies have been a decidedly mixed bag the best still being the 1982 ""The Wrath of Khan."" But this new one manages to hold its own in the galaxy. Part of the reason for that is the way it works humor often wry into the slam-bang proceedings. In this ""Beyond"" is closer to the original Gene Roddenberry TV incarnation than most of its filmic predecessors. This is a smart move Funny makes everything better even the frights.The Enterprise is three years into its five-year deep-space mission when it has the misfortune to encounter Krall (the suitably fearsome Idris Elba) a reptilian-looking alien lusting after a ""death machine"" artifact in the possession of Captain Kirk and Co. Until that little matter is resolved deep space is chockablock with mega-explosions and the Enterprise crew find themselves marooned without a spaceship on a barren and unfriendly planet.The Star Trek stalwarts are once again headed by Kirk (Chris Pine) Spock (Zachary Quinto) Sulu (John Cho) Uhura (Zoe Saldana) Bones (Karl Urban) Scotty (Simon Pegg who also co-wrote the film with Doug Jung) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin who died at 27 two months ago and to whom the film is dedicated; in addition there is an ""In Loving Memory"" citation for Leonard Nimoy). Recommended Star Trek How well do you know the Trek universe? The actors work so well together that they reinforce the series central appeal This crew is like family. A newcomer - Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) a sexy zebra-faced alien with a full arsenal of martial arts moves - would be a welcome addition for future installments. And I do hope there will be many more future installments. Id like to spend more time with these folks. Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.)

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Jul 22 2016 Culture In these dark times you might expect Star Trek Beyond to echo the tone of the previous film in this storied franchise Star Trek Into Darkness. That was a paranoid thriller about suicide bombers super-soldiers and ethical rot at the heart of government--a decidedly dystopian tale. Happily Beyond sweeps all of that aside delivering a rollicking adventure about the transformative good of teamwork and unity thats just as silly and enjoyable as that might sound. Its no complex masterpiece but its exactly the kind of fun steeped in effervescent goodwill that Hollywood should be delivering right now. Related Story Star Trek Beyond A Return to Fun? Like the two previous Star Trek films (which were directed by J.J. Abrams) Beyond stars Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Zoe Saldana and others as younger alternate versions of the original Enterprise crew whose adventures tend to be a little heavier on the action beats and CGI mayhem than Gene Roddenberrys original 60s TV show. After making a royal mess of Into Darkness and moving on to the Star Wars franchise Abrams handed the reins to the confident action director Justin Lin. Having revitalized the Fast amp; Furious franchise (directing the third fourth fifth and sixth entries) Lin uses the same magic to spruce Star Trek up. Unlike Abrams sweeping 2009 reboot Beyond can seem slight at times but in a way that recalls the best of the franchise harkening back to Roddenberrys original optimistic view of the future.Some might scoff but Lins time with Fast amp; Furious shines through even if the Enterprise crew is less muscle-bound. Theres a focus on squad unity with Captain Kirks team thriving by acting as a surrogate family--one that always has fun and tosses out one-liners as the action clangs around them. Everyone is given at least a moment to shine John Chos stoic family man Sulu Karl Urbans growling curmudgeon Bones and the sadly departed Anton Yelchins endlessly enthusiastic Pavel Chekov. Beyond written by its star Simon Pegg (who plays the irascible engineer Scotty) and Doug Jung is rarely five minutes from an action scene but it doesnt get overwhelmed by the endless set-pieces. Its two-hour running time breezes by in a blur of day-glo adventure and derring-do.Its refreshing to see a blockbuster that has any kind of philosophy especially one this good-hearted.Beyond begins with Captain Kirk (Pine) bored by the generally utopian universe he lives in shuttling through deep space on diplomatic missions for Starfleet and longing for some real action. He gets it quickly enough Embarking on a rescue mission into a remote nebula the Enterprise is attacked by a hive of alien ships and crash lands on an uncharted planet ruled by a tyrant named Krall (Idris Elba). For most of the film Krall is rather thinly sketched Speaking guttural halting English and mugging behind layers of scaly makeup Elba can only do so much with the role which doesnt get much context until the films climax.Still he represents a basic threat to everything Kirk and company stand for ranting about Starfleets emphasis on diplomacy and peace and cursing their pathetic emphasis on solidarity. Meanwhile the Enterprise crew scattered to four corners of the planet by Kralls assault have to come together to stop him making an alliance with another stranded alien warrior named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella). Pegg and Jungs script is simple stuff mostly avoiding the lovable ponderousness of past editions of Trek (theres no Patrick Stewart reciting Melville and Tennyson though Spock does at least slip in a Shakespeare line). Perhaps this reflects Hollywoods current lows more than anything else but its refreshing to see a blockbuster that has any kind of philosophy especially one this good-hearted.Best of all just as he did with the Fast amp; Furious franchise Lin never hits the audience over the head with the crews sweeping sense of diversity and the power they draw from their egoless camaraderie. Early on as the crew takes some shore leave on a space station you catch a sweet subtle glimpse of Sulu embracing his husband and child; when Uhura is captured by Krall she doesnt need her boyfriend Spocks help in escaping his clutches; and theres a continuation of the brotherhood between Scotty and his three-foot engineering assistant Keenser a beady-eyed fungus-resembling creature who sneezes acid any time he has a cold.Like the best Star Trek moments the lessons learned are about embracing each others idiosyncrasies and banding together to fight for a common good. Thats the kind of message Hollywood blockbusters should promote more often but it feels especially relevant to the present. When he created Star Trek 50 years ago Roddenberry was hoping to reflect humanitys best qualities in a paean to the future it could create for itself. Its heartening to see Star Trek Beyond continuing that noble cause.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

The dust has settled the excitement of this shiny new enterprise has worn off and now is the time when casual fans who were into the idea of a fresh ""Star Trek"" begin dropping out and ceding the series back to the Trekkies. ""Star Trek"" is now the popular Christmas toy that has been cast aside while the kids play ""Pokemon Go.""To their credit the filmmakers understand this and ""Star Trek Beyond"" opens with a voiceover by Captain James T. Kirk (a wonderful Chris Pine) that acknowledges as much. Its the ships 966th day in space the third year of a five-year mission and its all beginning to feel a bit monotonous. Where are we going? Whats our goal? Kirk is talking about the crew onboard the ship but he might as well be talking about the ""Star Trek"" franchise.So where do we go from here? Sadly for ""Beyond"" nowhere to break the film out of its third-chapter rut.While beaming through the stars the ship runs into some space interference and crash lands on a mysterious planet splitting the gang into small groups. Kirk is with Chekov (sweet sweet Anton Yelchin who died last month and to whom the film is dedicated along with the late Leonard Nimoy); Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Doctor ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) are together in another corner of the planet; Scotty (Simon Pegg who wrote the script along with Doug Jung) is off with Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) an alien who is helping the group find their way to safety; and Lt. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is captured by Krall (Idris Elba hidden under deep layers of alien makeup) the alien military commander whos looking to take down the Enterprise crew.As a rescue plan is hatched at one point the Enterprise crew learns they can defeat their foes by blasting their ships with 90s alt-rock jams. The ensuing embarrassment echoes throughout the solar system.Sofia Boutella plays Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond from Paramount Pictures Skydance Bad Robot Sneaky Shark and Perfect Storm Entertainment (Photo Photo credit Kimberley French)Director J.J. Abrams who revived the ""Star Trek"" franchise and brought the series vibrant new life has taken his lens flares with him and departed into another galaxy far far away. Hes handed the keys to the kingdom to Justin Lin whose ""Fast Five"" was the zippiest entry in the street racing series but Lins flashy sense of stylized grit is lost in a sea of sci-fi noise as ""Beyond"" becomes a monotonous blur of space babble and battles.Still there are human moments that elevate the film and give it a soul.Pine makes a fascinating Captain Kirk turning in the kind of nuanced work that rarely gets recognized in blockbuster filmmaking. Kirk has now outlived his father by one year and he is constantly wrestling with ghosts his own mortality and his sense of purpose all of which he expresses through anguished looks that rest just beneath his cocky veneer.Elba is a suitable villain but is largely lost underneath his layers of makeup. When his face is finally seen late in the film its his first appearance on screen in what has already been a 1 billion-plus year at the box office for the actor (he was a voice in ""The Jungle Book"" ""Zootopia"" and ""Finding Dory"" -- not a bad year).Mostly ""Star Trek Beyond"" keeps the franchise afloat even as tedium has set in.""Fear of death is illogical"" Spock tells Bones at one point to which Bones replies ""fear of death is what keeps us alive.""It seems to be the thing thats keeping the ""Star Trek"" series alive too.

At the start of the film Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) three years into his peacekeeping mission creaks open his closet full of identical yellow shirts and sighs. Three films into this reboot the brash young Kirk we met in 2009 seems light-years away. Space has that effect cautions Commodore Paris (Shohreh Aghdashloo). Humans cant whiz through an infinite omnidimensional map without scrambling two mental metaphorical needs direction and gravity. Groans Kirk ""Things have started to feel a little ... episodic."" In the first Trek Pine looked like a fresh-pressed Ken doll face still shiny from the heat. [Note The franchise is produced by Paramount which shares a corporate parent with MTV.] He was always good. Seven laps around the sun later hes interesting. Pine is now the same age William Shatner was when he launched the role. As he and the cast have grown up their fresh-hatched portrayals of the characters are merging into caricatures of the originals like 3-D glasses coming into focus. Karl Urbans Bones is Bonesier Simon Peggs Scotty is more Scottish and the late Anton Yelchins Chekov is once again insisting scotch was invented by a little old lady from Leningrad as he did 49 years ago in ""The Trouble With Tribbles."" Theyre even fusing with reality. John Chos Sulu has mind-melded so much with George Takei that hes been given a husband -- sort of. He doesnt have a wedding ring but an unnamed Asian man wordlessly hands him a baby and slings an arm around his waist low-key enough that conservatives can convince themselves the hunk is just his brother. As for Zachary Quinto the one actor who actually shared scenes with his prime theres a lovely quiet moment when he learns about the death of the original Spock. (Leonard Nimoy passed away last year after a half-century of playing the alien he described as ""more human than anyone else on the ship."") Two Vulcans silently hand Quinto the older Spocks things -- a man literally willing his belongings to himself -- and director Justin Lin backs the camera 50 feet away to let him privately absorb the loss. Paramount PicturesDuring this scene were on the space base Yorktown a hollow globe that looks like Bodyworlds plastinated Earth and sucked out all of the dirt. Its neat and then soon after were off to an uncharted nebula to battle the evil Krall (Idris Elba hidden inside an armadillo shell) and his fleet of flying metal fleas that can chew up a ship faster than you can say ""Moses spare us this plague"" Its an ironic weapon for a villain whose main talking point is that real warriors fight solo. ""Unity is not your strength its your weakness"" hisses Krall while his swarm clogs the sky. Someones not listening to their own script. But Krall gets his wish when the USS Enterprises crew is scattered on his planet along with an alien scientist who looks like a retro macrame blanket and an acid-washed female warrior (Sofia Boutella) with the ability to multiply herself into fighting holograms. At times the crew feels cloned too. Once the action starts these individual weirdos that fans have loved for five decades become just bodies without their own personalities discernible only by face and increasingly insane accent. Lin was handed the keys to the Enterprise after salvaging the Fast and Furious franchise with Fast Five. The gig makes sense. When he wants to Lin can steer an ensemble. He makes machines go zoom and bros bump fists. But in deep space no one can hear your engine rev. For one thing now the engines are pixels and the highways green screens. Beyond doesnt have the tactile crash-smash thrill of Vin Diesel gunning a Charger. Its more like that dumb gag in Furious 7 when cars skydive from a plane. Freed from reality Lin turns into a kid gifted a box of markers and glitter Everything is manic and distracting. Theres a cool swoosh where the lens surfs behind the Enterprise as it accelerates through a tube but mostly the tricks are garish. We zoom up and around the actors as though Lins using the camera to write ""pretty"" in cursive. Settle down cinematography. Just because you can swirl doesnt mean you should. The plot chases after the visuals like a greyhound on the track. Theres little conversation and most of it is wasted on twin subplots where both Captain Kirk and Spock debate quitting the Enterprise -- the one place we know theyll never leave. By Beyonds final floating fistfight Kirk probably longs for the monotony of the opening scene. I did -- its one of the only moments that feels lived in even though these actors have been inhabiting these roles for a fifth of their lives. I found myself grateful for cheap-looking shots of Bones and Spock kicking it on gold spray-painted rocks about the only time the film chills out long enough to let the cast show off their chemistry. Bones argues that Spock is a stalker and were forced to agree. ""The Vulcan heart is where the liver would be?"" asks Bones. Spock nods. Follow-up question Wheres their movies heart?

"Movie review Beyond is just what you want in a Star Trek movie | Entertainment News | ArcaMax Publishing www.arcamax.com ArcaMax Movie review Beyond is just what you want in a Star Trek movie Katie Walsh Tribune News Service on Jul 21 2016 Published in Entertainment News Theres only one thing we really want from a summer movie and thats fun. ""Star Trek Beyond"" is just that and it keeps reminding you thats what it is. Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a thrill-seeker a fun-loving guy and thats why he never hesitates to take on a questionable mission. We know its dangerous the stakes are apocalyptically high but this crew just seems to have too much fun doing it and thats best expressed in this latest installment of a series that could be called ""Star Trek The Abrams Generation.""J.J. Abrams relaunched the Starship Enterprise with this crew back in 2009 and helmed 2013s ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" but smartly hes handed the directorial reins to Justin Lin best known for turning ""Fast and Furious"" into a blockbuster franchise. Actor Simon Pegg also took over writing duties alongside Doug Jung from Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The result is a ""Star Trek"" film that whips along but with plenty of room for the beloved characters and all their quirks to shine through.This is one of those ""Trek"" tales where the crew gets stranded on a distant planet during a dangerous rescue mission. The Enterprise is brought down by the destructive Krall (Idris Elba) who is hell bent on making humanity stronger through struggle (or something). As in most of these movies the villain isnt really the point. Theres a bad guy and he wants a little thingy that will help him end the world.""Star Trek"" has been and always will be about the crew of the Enterprise and their unique chemistry as individuals that makes them stronger as a group. Smartly theyre split up into unlikely pairs initially -- turns out Bones (Karl Urban) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) are the perfect odd couple ones folksiness not quite clicking with the others extreme logic and Captain Kirk is stranded with little bro Chekhov (Anton Yelchin). Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Sulu (John Cho) are taken prisoner while Scotty makes a new friend in the fierce Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) who escaped the evil Krall and is looking to get off this planet by any means necessary. Shes absolutely the breakout character of the film.""Beyond"" is an egalitarian adventure movie everyone getting a moment to shine or have their hero moment. Its especially gratifying to see the excellent supporting actors come to the forefront like Chos Sulu (who is newly out and proud) and Urbans hilariously dry Bones. Yelchin is also a treat as cheeky Chekhov a sad reminder that the young actor was taken far too soon.The film clips along quickly with tremendously efficient exposition that builds out the character motivations but is never bogged down by mythology. Lins roving camera smoothly swoops above the landscape and into tight corners. Some of the action drifts into dark dim confusing territory and the villain is bungled -- even with Elbas sonorous elocution the makeup robs him of his charisma. The stakes are somehow far too high and too low when the bad guy possesses some world-eating swarm of space dust.But ""Beyond"" is a brighter than ""Into Darkness"" a vast improvement and its everything you want a post-modern ""Trek"" movie to be funny poppy self-referential -- and with Captain Kirk punching bad guys in rubber masks of course.STAR TREK BEYOND3 out of 4 starsCast Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Zoe Saldana John Cho Anton Yelchin Karl Urban Idris Elba Sofia BoutellaDirected by Justin LinRunning time 2 hoursRated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.(c)2016 Tribune Content Agency LLCDistributed by Tribune Content Agency LLC.",http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1854005?print,200,startrek12,startrek,arcamax
"Star Trek Beyond boldly goes kind of where you expect it to but with style - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Star Trek Beyond boldly goes kind of where you expect it to but with style The Times Kenneth Turan says Star Trek Beyond gives fans what they want but it doesnt catch fire Kenneth Turan reviews Star Trek Beyond directed by Justin Lin and starring Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Idris Elba Sofia Boutella Zoe Saldana John Cho Anton Yelchin Simon Pegg and Karl Urban. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Star Trek Beyond directed by Justin Lin and starring Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Idris Elba Sofia Boutella Zoe Saldana John Cho Anton Yelchin Simon Pegg and Karl Urban. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Taking its celebrated ""Live long and prosper"" salute to heart ""Star Trek"" has become not just a movie franchise but a pop culture empire. About to turn 50 it has spawned 13 films and six TV series sold more than 100 million books comics and magazines and continues to have such cachet that Amazons mighty monarch Jeff Bezos himself asked for a cameo in ""Star Trek Beyond.""""Beyond"" is the third episode in producer J.J. Abrams reboot of the Gene  Roddenberry episodic TV concept of a plucky spaceship crew exploring strange new worlds and boldly going where no one had managed to go before. Abrams who directed the last two films has turned this one over to fellow franchise wrangler Justin Lin best known for four consecutive episodes of the kinetic ""Fast amp; Furious"" series.Given how much was riding on this films success in todays risk-averse Hollywood not to mention how many different constituencies had to be pleased the fact that the result is serviceable delivering enough value to be worth a fans time is about as good as one could reasonably expect. And because Lins ""Fast amp; Furious"" films live up to their names its not surprising that the action set pieces in particular and the look of ""Beyond"" in general are among its strengths.Not only have Lin and company (including cinematographer Stephen F. Windon production designer Tom Sanders and make-up designer Joel Harlow) created more than 50 alien races theyve come up with some nifty alien worlds especially the enormous spaceport of Yorktown whose streets were shot in futuristic Dubai.Because Lin has apparently been a ""Star Trek"" fan since his youth he is in tune with the earnestness that is one of the TV series legacies. At its best this results in a heartfelt tribute to the late Leonard  Nimoy the original Spock. Star Trek Beyond trailer Watch the trailer for ""Star Trek Beyond"" featuring Rihannas new single ""Sledgehammer."" Watch the trailer for ""Star Trek Beyond"" featuring Rihannas new single ""Sledgehammer."" See more videos As written by actor Simon Pegg (whose credits include ""Shaun of the Dead"" and who also returns as chief engineer Montgomery Scott) and Doug Jung ""Beyond"" spends measurable time on a variety of riffs and character moments with returning regulars. These include Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) Lieutenant Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana) Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) and Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin the young actor who died in a June 19 accident).Yet even though all these people are back they are not necessarily endlessly fascinating and as conversational moments with them go on ""Beyond"" in general especially in its middle sections starts to feel like it is marking time as much as anything else.In fact ""Beyonds"" most involving characters are its new ones starting with the energetically villainous Krall (Idris Elba almost unrecognizable under five hours of makeup).Much more amusing is a can-do alien named Jaylah engagingly played under kabuki-style makeup by Sofia Boutella soon to play the title character in ""The Mummy"" opposite Tom Cruise.Boutella is especially charming in Jaylahs deadpan idiosyncratic use of English as she calls Captain Kirk ""James-tee"" and refers to engineer Scott as ""Montgomery Scottie."" When she says it its funny. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Like its characters the plot of ""Beyond"" is effective in fits and starts something the screenplay seems to jokingly acknowledge when it has Kirk read a captains log entry saying ""things feel episodic.""We catch up to the crew of the Starship Enterprise three years into its five-year mission on its 966th day in deep space to be precise. After a knockabout encounter with a particularly obtuse alien race the ship heads to Yorktown for routine maintenance.The crew has barely arrived however when the Enterprise is needed for what sounds like a fairly routine mission rescuing a stranded crew that has been shipwrecked somewhere deep inside an uncharted nebula. But as the captain says quoting the TV series as it turns out ""theres no such thing as the unknown only things temporarily hidden.""But things in deep space are not always as they seem and Enterprise crew members end up stranded on planet Altamid dependent on each other as they deal with the machinations and depredations of Krall who no surprise will stop at nothing to achieve his nefarious aims.While this setup is effective there is a sense of the pro forma in the way ""Star Trek Beyond"" carefully makes its appointed rounds dotting the is and crossing the ts. Fun but in a careful way the film lasts just two hours but it can seem much longer than that.""Star Trek Beyond""MPAA rating PG-13 for scenes of sci-fi action and violenceRunning time 2 hours and 2 minutesIn general releaseALSOStar Trek Beyond stars on uncomfortable conversations Sulus sexual orientation and the futureI really disagreed with it What changed John Chos mind about playing Star Treks Sulu as gayAnton Yelchin actor in Star Trek films dies in freak car accident at age 27New Star Trek series promises new heroes new villains and a whole new look Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Star Trek Beyond Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-star-trek-beyond-review-20160718-snap-story.html#nt=oft03a-1la1,200,startrek13,startrek,latimes

Photo Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com July 21 2016 420 p.m. ET 85 COMMENTS ""Star Trek Beyond"" starts with a joke about size. Nothing to do with contemporary politics--its an optical joke a clever reminder that size is a relative thing. So it is with this production the 13th feature based on the TV series which debuted 50 years ago. The movie looks big with plenty of battles in galaxies beyond far away but it feels smallish a congenial adventure with familiar friends. Those battles are slow to begin. The Enterprise is three years into a five-year mission to explore the unknown but the story takes its time recapitulating the known. Capt. James T. Kirk (another engaging performance by Chris Pine) is pensive on his birthday as he realizes that hes one year older than his father got to be. ""To perfect eyesight and a full head of hair"" Karl Urbans ""Bones"" McCoy offers as a toast. ""Live long and prosper"" says Zachary Quintos Spock who at this point is less Kirks partner in a long-running bromance than in an Alphonse-and-Gaston routine of elaborate politeness. ""We make a good team"" Kirk tells him. ""I believe we do"" Spock replies. More Reviews Dont Think Twice Lights Out Read More San Diego Comic-Con What Fans Think of Star Trek Beyond Prominent Star Trek Character Is Gay in New Film Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films The larger team is shadowed of course by two losses--the death last year of Leonard Nimoy  the original Spock and last month of Anton Yelchin the exuberant young actor seen here for the last time as the unquenchable optimist Pavel Chekov. (Chekov is as ever inflamed by a beguiling mix of passion and desperation.) And once the battles finally do get under way theres another intimation of fragility if not mortality in the fate that befalls the Enterprise--catastrophic damage to one of the flagship vessels of movie myth. Our species is at perpetual risk in the space-time continuum the movie tells us though courage grit good acting and bright writing can help us along the way. ( Justin Lin directed efficiently from a screenplay written by Simon Pegg--who also plays Scotty the Enterprises chief engineer--and Doug Jung. The cinematographer was Stephen F. Windon who previously worked with Mr. Lin on three films in the ""Fast and Furious"" series.) Karl Urban and Zachary Quinto in Star Trek Beyond Photo Paramount Pictures The plot is linear and essentially mystery-free with a MacGuffin called an abronath; in the wrong hands it could blow up everything everywhere. Unexpectedly dispatched to rescue a crew stranded in uncharted territory the Enterprise is ambushed by a fleet commanded by a space creep called Krall whos played by Idris Elba. Many of the ensuing battles are generic and boring in spite of computer graphics that have previously conjured up a lovely vision of a Utopian city in a deep-space station called Yorktown Base. Thats because Kralls fleet consists of a digital swarm of tiny shiplets so numerous and featureless that they amount to a visual abstraction. Krall on the other hand is concretely evil a vampiric creature with terrible teeth whose motives as eventually revealed are banal. Krall does however visit ample misery on the Enterprise and its crew so hes perversely responsible for some of the movies better moments. One of them comes when the Enterprise is under siege and all systems are failing rapidly. Suddenly Scotty finds two cables that have been torn asunder plugs them back together and whammo the ship is back to 100% power. Another comes when Spock severely injured on an alien planet is succored by his old friend Bones; the scene is medically silly even by ""Star Trek"" standards yet emotionally resonant. (Spocks tenderly fraught relationship with Zoe Saldanas Lt. Uhura is revisited briefly and wittily.) In the run-up to the films release much has been made of the decision to reveal that Sulu the Enterprise helmsman played by John Cho is gay. The film treats the issue matter-of-factly almost fleetingly. Whats fascinating is the reaction of the original Sulu George Takei. Mr. Takei has expressed his disapproval not because hes opposed to LGBT equality--he revealed in 2005 that he is gay--but because he believes the decision runs counter to the vision of ""Star Trek"" creator Gene Roddenberry. That vision still informs the feature series though sometimes in an odd way. Effects that are less than special and dialogue that is less than sparkling can be endearing for dedicated Trekkies because theyre reminiscent of the original TV series. Its not that worse is considered better but that not-bad can be seen as OK. ""Star Trek Beyond"" is better than not-bad. By any earthly standard its good. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download Like Crazy (2011) I recommended Drake Doremuss wise and beautiful little film a couple of years ago but its worth noting again unfortunately after the recent death of its co-star Anton Yelchin. He plays Jacob a tender young American who falls in love with Anna (Felicity Jones) a vivacious young Englishwoman studying at a California college. Anna overstays her student visa by two months but the ensuing complications are only pretexts for a study of lovers falling from a state of grace. Z for Zachariah (2015) Chris Pine has a small but important part in this daringly spare post-apocalyptic thriller that Craig Zobel directed from a fine screenplay by Nissar Modi. At the outset the only two living creatures in a leafy Eden are Ann ( Margot Robbie) and her dog Pharaoh. Soon Chiwetel Ejiofors Loomis a research scientist appears clad in a radiation suit. Next Mr. Pines Caleb an appealing local arrives on the scene after which jealousy rears its unmistakable head. 79 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

New Star Trek beyond belief but still fun review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNew Star Trek beyond belief but still fun reviewStar Trek Beyond has a script bursting with implausibility but it looks great and the action never lets up.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. July 21 2016Star Trek BeyondStarring Chris Pine Zachary Quinto John Cho Zoe Saldana and Anton Yelchin. Directed by Justin Lin. Opens Friday at major theatres. 120 minutes. In the hands of action director Justin Lin the newest addition to the rebooted Star Trek franchise is a supercharged treat teeming with visual splendour.But theres a black hole of implausibility at the centre of the film sucking in all light and matter related to logic and reason which may diminish the pleasure for filmgoers.Article Continued BelowIn short deep thinking could spoil the fun.Chris Pine returns as Kirk centre in Star Trek Beyond.  (Kimberley French / Paramount Pictures)  The story opens with the stalwart crew three years into a five-year mission and everyone feeling a little pensive. Kirk (Chris Pine) is pondering his future as a starship captain while Spock (Zachary Quinto) ends his relationship with Uhura (Zoe Saldana) in anticipation of returning to his Vulcan homeland.But reflection is fleeting when an attack by a locustlike swarm of enemy ships on the Enterprise shreds it like so much grated Swiss cheese. Trapped on an unknown planet crew members struggle for a way off and to thwart an imminent attack on a nearby starbase by the villainous Krall (Idris Elba).The frenetic pace provides distraction from a script that suffers from hoary dialogue and plot twists -- for example the way the alien swarm is eventually discombobulated -- that will send eyeballs rolling toward deep space.The revelation that Sulu (John Cho) has a male partner and a little girl i.e. is gay is handled in such a low-key manner two blinks and it could easily be missed.Sadly the script doesnt give much opportunity for Anton Yelchin to shine in his final performance as Chekov. (The actor died in a freak car accident on June 19.)Sci-fi fans will surely see beyond any shortcomings and appreciate a film full of visual dazzle action and suspense.Read more about Star TrekThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Also under Titles misleading as this entry in the rebooted sci-fi franchise is very much a circling back. Justin Lin has taken over the helm from J.J.

So yeah bust up the Enterprise (in oddly boring fashion) bring on The Enemy Within work on Kirks personal issues etc. (In case youre not paying attention on that latter bit you get three count em three iterations of how the Captain is feeling all at sea in the first half-hour.) How much youll enjoy it depends largely on why youre watching. If you like hearing Bones say ""My God"" and ""Dammit Jim"" and ""Dammit Spock"" youre good. If you like hearing Spock iron the emotion out of emotional speech for humorous effect grand. If you like hearing Scottie call a pretty young alien he just met ""Lassie"" over and over dandy. And if you like huge weightless action setpieces interspersed with a lot of standing and talking youre in for a treat. But the happiest by far will be those who favor convoluted explanatory speeches from the villain in the closing minutes. 2016. -- Matthew Lickona Showtimes AMC Fashion Valley 7037 Friars Road San

Kirk (Chris Pine) voice-overing a new entry in his captains log at the beginning of Star Trek Beyond. And sure enough there is something a little off - and old-school series TV-ish - as the crew of the Starship Enterprise warp-speeds through deep space on the 966th day of its five-year mission to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go yada-yada. Cowritten by Simon Pegg who double-duties as Scotty the ships steady-as-she-goes engineer Star Trek Beyond moves beyond the central dynamic of the first two franchise reboots Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013). In those films the action pivoted around Kirk and his Vulcan best bud Spock (Zachary Quinto). The rest of the Enterprise crew had face time on the bridge but in Star Trek Beyond the playing field is leveled. So is the Enterprise itself when a surprise attack in an uncharted nebula brings the pride of the Federations starfleet crashing down in horrific shards on the highly hostile planet Altamid. Kirk played by the increasingly Shatneresque Pine gets stranded with young Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin - the film is dedicated ""for Anton""). Spock finds himself in the company of the cranky medico ""Bones"" McCoy (an Al Gore-ish Karl Urban). Uhura (Zoe Saldana) smarting from her breakup with Spock explores the treacherous terrain of Altamid with Sulu (John Cho). And Scotty eventually teams with a new cast member an agile alien warrior with black lines etched on her mime-white face. Jaylah is her name and Sofia Boutella from Kingsman plays her with a mournful scowl strange diction and some deft MMA moves. The villain of the piece is a rumbling entity called Krall (Idris Elba virtually unrecognizable under layers of reptilian prosthetics) who wants to get his gargantuan mitts on a ""death machine"" artifact. Its the 23rd-century MacGuffin that sets everybody running around firing their phasers frantically trying to regroup and restore order to the universe. Before the universe is destroyed. There is plenty in Star Trek Beyond for diehard Trekkers to enjoy and director Justin Lin (Fast amp; Furious) guns the action sequences - even if that motocross machine that Kirk is ostensibly riding looks totally fake and video-game-ish. The original Star Trek series - launched in 1979 with a soporific thud redeemed with 1982s Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan and then onward for four subsequent titles before the Next Generation crew took over - followed a definite pattern. A lame one alternated with a game one a clunky entry and then a smart and nimble follow-up. Compared to its J.J. Abrams-directed forerunners Star Trek Beyond comes across as kind of a dud. Which may augur well for the next installment announced this week star date to be determined. sreaphillynews.com 215-854-5629Steven_Rea MOVIE REVIEW Star Trek Beyond 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Justin Lin.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.JUST WATCHEDMovie Pass Star Trek BeyondReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMovie Pass Star Trek Beyond 0139Los Angeles (CNN)Near the beginning of ""Star Trek Beyond"" Captain Kirk complains about life on the Starship Enterprise having grown ""episodic."" The same can largely be said of this third outing with the new cast -- though in this context thats generally a good thing.While imbued with a melancholy streak due to the untimely death of actor Anton Yelchin along with the passing of Leonard Nimoy this latest adventure plays like a throwback from the old ""Trek"" series -- inflated naturally into a big sprawling IMAX-worthy version of it.Perhaps for that reason the movie starts with considerable energy peaks about halfway through and feels as if its padding and improvising gravity-defying threats in the last half-hour or so though not enough to significantly offset its other charms. In a summer of ho-hum blockbusters this one at least mostly delivers especially for those weaned on ""Star Trek"" lore.Three years into its five-year mission the Enterprise is dealing with the drudgery of space exploration when Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew dock at a massive space station. There they learn of a stranded ship in a nebula that no other help can reach.The rescue effort however quickly (if not unexpectedly) goes awry as the Enterprise faces a sneak attack by an overwhelming enemy in whats easily the movies most visually dazzling sequence. From there its down to the nearest planet where the scattered crew must try to thwart the genocidal aims of Krall (Idris Elba).Read MoreBecause the key members of the Enterprise crew are a constant element these movies are in some ways defined by their villains. And while Krall is plenty evil the compelling actor playing him has a tough time chewing his way through the heavy makeup under which hes mired. Compared to the last outing featuring Benedict Cumberbatch who wasnt burdened with bulky prosthetics its a step down.Fortunately director Justin Lin (a veteran of the ""Fast amp; Furious"" franchise working from Simon Pegg and Doug Jungs screenplay) keeps the pace humming along while offering nifty character notes. That includes wisely placing Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) in peril together allowing them to bicker and faced with death flirt with admitting how fond they really are of each other.The title notwithstanding ""Beyond"" operates within a pretty narrow frontier and doesnt bring anything especially bold or new to the equation. But theres something to be said for its workmanlike efficiency. In more earthbound terms that should also bring some good news to its studio Paramount amid the corporate soap opera currently surrounding it.Granted with all the galaxies at its disposal and yet another TV series in dry dock one might hope for a ""Star Trek"" movie with a bit more narrative heft. But in terms of delivering solid entertainment for its devoted base?

(Photo credit Kimberley French/Kimberley French) This latest entry in the venerable ""Star Trek"" franchise breaks little new ground. For a series supposedly about the future ""Star Trek"" remains firmly rooted in the franchises long and very prosperous past. Rated 2 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times Well theyve done gone and shredded the Enterprise in ""Star Trek Beyond."" Smashed the old girl full of holes and crashed her in flaming flinders onto the surface of a far-distant planet. And theyve scattered the crew two-by-two Spock (Zachary Quinto) with ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) Kirk (Chris Pine) with Mr. Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin) Uhura (Zoe Saldana) with Mr. Sulu (John Cho) and Scotty (Simon Pegg) with ... a newcomer a young female alien named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella). Keep an eye on that one. Shes a kick-butt (literally; great martial-arts moves) scene stealer. Movie Review    Star Trek Beyond with Chris Pine Simon Pegg Zachary Quinto Zoe Saldana Karl Urban Anton Yelchin John Cho and Idris Elba. Directed by Justin Lin from a screenplay by Pegg and Doug Jung. 120 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence. Several theaters. Their mission to somehow find their way back to one another and kick (literally) plenty of alien butt along the way. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

It should. It is. Its ""Star Trek"" after all. The pattern for these pictures has been set for decades and this latest entry in the series breaks little new ground. Oh there is a very brief scene early on where Sulu is shown greeting and embracing his husband and young daughter. But that aspect of his life is never explored. Thus does ""Star Trek"" make a stab at keeping up with the times nodding at a present-day cultural reality. Otherwise it serves up more of the usual Bones comically kvetching about Spocks by-the-book logic-driven ways; Kirk impetuously running headlong into danger driven by the need to measure up to his heroic late father; and Scotty desperately trying to keep the Enterprise and later another older creakier starship from coming apart at the seams. Under the direction of Justin Lin (taking the reins from J.J. Abrams who directed the previous two ""Treks"") action scenes are so chaotically edited its often difficult to figure out whos bashing and crashing into whom. And as the alien villain of the piece Idris Elba is so weighted down with head-covering prosthetics that its often difficult to make out what hes saying. At times the picture feels like a nostalgia tour. The passing of Leonard Nimoy is the basis of a scene in which young Spock is shown mourning in his stoic Vulcan way the death of old Spock. (The recent death of Yelchin is acknowledged in a title card.) And toward the end a photo of the original members of the Enterprise crew -- Nimoy William Shatner DeForest Kelley et al. all in full uniform -- is reverently displayed. For a series supposedly about the future ""Star Trek"" remains firmly rooted in the franchises long-lived and very prosperous past.

But it is another case of an aging franchise running short of good individual films  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune July 21 2016 -- 207pm Paramount Anton Yelchin Chris Pine and John Cho appear in a scene from ""Star Trek Beyond."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint After its impressive ""Star Trek"" reboot and entertaining sequel Paramount Pictures faces the inevitable moment when a longtime meal ticket begins to deliver leftovers. ""Star Trek Beyond"" is not a stale rehash equal to the studios painful ""Terminator Genisys."" But it is another case of an aging franchise running short of good individual films even when it pursues an alternate timeline. Its not wholly bereft of creativity. Credit to all involved for giving the early scenes a wry sense of humor. Co-writer and co-star Simon (""Scotty"") Pegg has been a devoted Trekker for decades and his light touch balances camp humor and character friendships with moments of emotional punch here just as he did in ""Shawn of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz."" As the film opens Capt. James T. Kirk amusingly fumbles a peace treaty with a tribunal of very annoying aliens narrates details of crew coitus on the USS Enterprise and reveals that after so much time in space he is uncertain of his five-year mission. Pegg also understands that certain elements should not be avoided. The unexpected chat in the ships saloon between Kirk (Chris Pine) and ever grouchy Dr. Bones McCoy (Karl Urban) digs into personal details that usually go unspoken in the series. And theres a lot of pleasure in seeing those two actors play verbal pingpong. The prologue is a roundabout way of establishing an interesting new perspective on familiar material. Precisely because we didnt see that coming it pays off. Nonetheless the film industrys increasingly dominant international market doesnt turn out for a good story but for relentless action thats bigger louder and smash-happier than anything seen before. It is triggered here by the arrival of xenomorphs who are hijacking the crews from interstellar ships. They are plotting a blitzkrieg against the headquarters of the peace-loving United Federation of Planets for incredibly strange reasons I cannot explain. This time the attack is delivered not from a death star but a near-infinite sandstorm of tiny attack jets that the Enterprise crew calls ""the bees."" Paramount Chris Pine right with Anton Yelchin in ""Star Trek Beyond."" Check your brain at the door; you wont need it for the next two hours. Hang on to your earplugs however. The subterfuge behind the attacks is echoed by a lissome new alien who becomes our heroes ally (Sofia Boutella as Jaylah which sounds a lot like Jennifer Lawrences nickname). A resourceful tough cookie she uses sci-fi smoke screens to conceal her whereabouts on the planet of the bad aliens. Theres a similar contradictory feeling to the screenplay co-written by Doug Jung a mystery box secretly packed with material we saw in this universe not so long ago. If you liked seeing Kirk race a motorcycle in 2009s ""Star Trek"" youll see lots more here. Remember him rolling over the corridor walls floors and ceilings as the Enterprise wildly power-dove in 2013s ""Star Trek Into Darkness""? Here every member of the cast joins him slip-sliding in repeated tailspins. Recall how that films anonymous villain hid his surprising true identity ultimately revealed as a Starfleet officer who went rogue then lived in space unobserved for centuries with a really big grudge? Would you like another serving? You can tell that J.J. Abrams who helmed the first two films isnt involved here. His signature lens flares are nowhere to be seen. This entry belongs to director Justin Lin who has steered the highly illogical ""Fast amp; Furious"" series into ever higher success. He is solid with action set pieces and this film has a million of them. Lins work is wildly ambitious visually often to the point of overkill. Mostly though I felt the quicksand pull of being sucked into plot holes. At one point one of the crew members is put into heart-stopping peril with absolutely no way out. A couple of scenes later he just strolls back into the action chipper as can be. Throughout the film we see thousands of red shirts wiped off the Enterprises decks yet we know none of them and at the finale cocktail party none of them gets a toast beyond a mere ""Heres to absent friends."" It seems like the final frontier might actually be thinking about the bleak destruction that the film has just served us. colin.covertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 Twitter colincovert ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan July 21 Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) center and the crew of the starship Enterprise face a new villain in ""Star Trek Beyond."" (Kimberley French/Paramount Pictures) To any connoisseur of the original ""Star Trek"" television series the sight of Captain James T. Kirk in a torn shirt will feel as familiar as family. (The character had a bad habit of ruining gold uniform tunics in his frequent fights.) So when the actor Chris Pine -- who plays Kirk in the current series of rebooted movies -- says ""I ripped my shirt again"" after his peace offering to a delegation of tiny gargoyle-like aliens goes anticly awry the in-joke which opens ""Star Trek Beyond"" hits on all cylinders aliens; good intentions thwarted; violent conflict; and perhaps most importantly a sense of winking self-aware humor. The cutaway which shows Kirk staring into a closet hung with several identical replacement tops is priceless. That opening rimshot sets the tone for what follows -- an action-packed fun and funny thrill ride into a cinematic nebula that may be uncharted for the crew of the starship Enterprise but that will be comfortably recognizable to both diehard Trekkers and those who only beamed on board once producer J.J. Abrams took over the helm with the 2009 film. (Abrams who directed the first two new ""Star Trek"" films has relinquished the captains chair to director Justin Lin of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise who maintains Abramss balance between respect for tradition and the restless need for innovative storytelling.) [J.J. Abrams delivers a blend of new and old in Star Trek Into Darkness] As for the controversy over the fact that Sulu (John Cho) is shown to have a male life partner in the new film -- played by Doug Jung who wrote the screenplay with actor Simon Pegg who plays Scotty -- thats a nonissue. The only question anyone should care about is Can Sulu do his job? And the answer as the helmsman says to Kirk after being asked whether he knows how to fly a broken-down jury-rigged replacement ship when the Enterprise runs spectacularly shockingly aground is snarkily appropriate ""Are you kidding me?"" [Sulu is gay in the next Star Trek movie. George Takei isnt happy about that.] That attitude of cocky self-assurance is in full -- if sometimes sublimated -- force here even when things are looking most dire for the Enterprise crew who quickly find themselves lured into a cataclysmic ambush by a new villain named Krall (Idris Elba all but buried beneath a Halloween mask of hideous prosthetics) on a planet where their only hope is a solitary alien resistance fighter. Sofia Boutella stars as resistance fighter Jaylah. (Kimberley French/Paramount Pictures) Jaylah as that rebel is called is a welcome female addition to the predominantly male cast. While it has always been ethnically diverse the crew has traditionally been something of a boys club. As played by the French Algerian actress Sofia Boutella -- under a patina of black-and-white face paint that makes her look like an angry street mime -- Jaylah gives Daisy Ridleys Rey of ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" a run for her money. Not just as a warrior but as a character she brings new hope and life to this tried-and-true story -- not to mention some cool new technology. Hiding out in the hulk of an abandoned Starfleet ship Jaylah has taught herself broken English (presumably from listening to old rap tunes that were left there by the long-dead crew). One key stratagem of the Enterprise crew against Krall involves weaponizing a recording of the Beastie Boys ""Sabotage"" -- ""classical music"" as Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) calls it in this 23rd-century world. Without spoiling anything its the most imaginative rump-shaking use of diegetic sound Ive heard in a long time and it gives Chief Engineer Scotty the opportunity to shout over the films near-constant din ""Ive just got to reconfigure the VHF output into a multiphasic sweep"" Warning One long-held ""Trek"" tradition is technical mumbo-jumbo. With its talk of ""gravitational slipstreams"" and the like ""Beyond"" is no exception. Deal with it. [Summer Movie Guide Mutants superheroes robots and reboots] Occasionally there are things that just dont make sense even with a mind charitably predisposed toward the elasticity of science fiction. Case in point When Kralls forces first attack the Enterprise -- with a swarm of mini-kamikaze ships called ""bees"" -- the enemy fighters repeatedly puncture the Enterprises hull all the way to the crews living quarters. Strangely there is no loss to the ships artificial atmosphere. As incongruous as that may seem in the vacuum of deep space ""Star Trek Beyond"" is no embarrassment to the franchise. Rather its a proud addition to a canon that even the ghost of creator Gene Roddenberry would appreciate. It may not boldly go where no ""Star Trek"" film has gone before but it gets there at warp speed and with a full tank of fresh ideas. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains science-fiction action and violence. 122 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"Star Trek Beyond reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Star Trek Beyond Doesnt Reinvent the Franchise but It Gets Whats Made It Live Long and Prosper Star Trek Beyond Doesnt Reinvent the Franchise but It Gets Whats Made It Live Long and Prosper Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 21 2016 145 PM Star Trek Beyond The latest film doesnt reinvent the franchise but it does understand whats made it live long and prosper. By Dana Stevens Sofia Boutella as a tough alien in Star Trek Beyond. Kimberley French/Paramount Pictures ""It can be a challenge to feel grounded when even the gravity is artificial"" confides a burned-out Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) in the unusually personal captains log entry that kicks off Star Trek Beyond the third installment in the most recent reboot of the venerable franchise. (Entries one and two were directed by J.J. Abrams in 2009 and 2013; here he takes a producer credit while the Fast and Furious franchises Justin Lin directs.) Its three years into the starship Enterprises five-year mission and as Kirk further notes in a wry nod to Star Treks televisual origin ""things have started to feel a little ... episodic."" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Viewers no longer able to remember a summer when they werent bombarded by recycled versions of familiar pop-culture spectacles will identify with the captains obscure sense of malaise. But we dont have to spend too long in the dumps with Kirk; not long after asking a Starfleet superior (Shohreh Aghdashloo) for a transfer to a desk job the hotheaded young captain gets all the action he could ask for. After making a routine provisioning stop at a Federation base called Yorktown--an ingeniously designed floating city whose intersecting multidimensional skylines would do M.C. Escher proud--the Enterprise is attacked by a fierce rogue alien named Krall (Idris Elba all but unrecognizable under an elaborate reptilian mask). Kralls aim to take possession of an ancient alien weapon that the ship is carrying back to its planet of origin on a diplomatic mission. (This brick-sized ""death machine"" bears the impressively silly name ""the Abronath"" a word I propose henceforth be used interchangeably with Hitchcocks term MacGuffin. You cant have a proper sci-fi space adventure without a good solid Abronath.) Advertisement In his eagerness to get his scaly hands on this all-important rectangle Krall winds up causing the ship to crash-land on a spiky-surfaced planet called Altamid. As Kirks beloved Enterprise is being torn to a heap of debris--a sight thats always hard to watch for a Trek fan no matter how many times weve seen the ship destroyed and rebuilt--the crew separates into rescue pods leaving them scattered on different parts of the planet with their vessel inoperable and their communications cut off. Kirk and Chekov--the young Russian officer played by Anton Yelchin who died last month in a wrenching freak accident--wind up together accompanied by a tentacle-headed alien played by Lydia Wilson. Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) and the ships doctor McCoy (Karl Urban) are also stranded together allowing for some enjoyably crabby interplay between the cool logic-driven Vulcan and the passionate empathic doctor. Ship engineer Montgomery Scott--endearingly played by Simon Pegg who also co-wrote the script with Doug Jung--meets up with a forbiddingly tough alien woman (Sofia Boutella) whos been squatting in another crashed Federation vehicle using her martial arts-style fighting skills and technical know-how to stay alive in this inhospitable environment. The rest of the crew including Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Sulu (John Cho) are taken prisoner by Krall. Id be hard pressed to explain the precise reason behind each of the extended space battles that make up Star Trek Beyonds mushy middle section. The ships crew is besieged by hordes of ""destroyer pods"" Kralls weapons of choice which swarm together like bees or schools of fish. Meanwhile in an inspired bit of MacGyver-ing whose mechanics I wont spoil the Federation manages to combat these flying claws by making a weapon out of the Beastie Boys ""Sabotage."" (""Is that classical music?"" asks McCoy reminding us that all this is taking place sometime in the 23rd century.) Those clouds of silvery swarming doodads are mesmerizing to watch as they dart and swirl through space and Lin makes the most of the awe-inspiring effects of scale that the IMAX format allows. But Star Trek Beyond is most rewarding when it returns to human-scaled interactions Kirk gradually regaining his captainly mojo as he devises a plan to rescue his crew; Spock struggling to reconcile his feelings for Uhura with his duty to repopulate New Vulcan; or Sulu heading off for some Ramp;R with his daughter and male life partner (played in a dialogue-free cameo by the films co-writer Doug Jung). The original Star Trek as conceived by Gene Roddenberry was a bastion of liberal utopianism in a constricted Cold War world. Among other things the series included one of American televisions first interracial kisses--even if Kirk and Uhura were being compelled to smooch by evil godlike aliens. In our arguably more inclusive age expanding that universe to include a gay character feels right--especially when that character is Sulu played in the original series by the out-and-proud actor George Takei who has insisted that his recent remarks objecting to the characters newly revealed sexuality were taken out of context. Top Comment Like most Star Trek movies it has a lot of dialogue about big ideas and the potential of humanity and ends with Kirk and a guy in a rubber suit whaling on each other.   More... Join In What really makes this most recent Star Trek iteration worth watching even in lackluster chapters like 2013s Into Darkness is the beautifully chosen cast. Kirk and Spock two iconic characters wedded in the minds of several generations of fans to the actors who first played them must be daunting roles to take on but Pine and Quinto manage to convey their most essential qualities--Kirks short temper and forceful-yet-intuitive management style Spocks intellectual curiosity and dry sense of humor about the illogical foibles of his human crewmates--without ever slipping into mere impersonations of say William Shatners staccato line delivery or the impeccably raised right eyebrow of the late great Leonard Nimoy. Its to Nimoy and the heartbreakingly promising Anton Yelchin that this film is dedicated. Star Trek Beyond may not go where no Trek has gone before but its that very fidelity to the shows original values that will keep fans trekking to the box office. Read more in Slate about Star Trek.

Sometimes in the white-hot center of summer all were looking for is a whiz-bang sci-fi adventure saga featuring a host of familiar and beloved characters (and increasingly familiar faces) having another adventure that falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum on their overall epic adventure. Even with its big-screen pyrotechnics and its feature-length running time ""Star Trek Beyond"" plays like an extended version of one of the better episodes from the original series and I mean that in the best possible way. Theres nearly as much light comedy as gripping drama nearly as much talk of family unity as end-of-the-world gloom and doom. Its a welcome break from all the ""heaviosity"" in so many recent franchise films with superheroes bickering over the collateral damage they cause and government agencies debating whether the good guys are really bad guys and men in capes and costumes nearly paralyzed by their inner existential conflicts. ""Star Trek Beyond"" is directed with kinetic enthusiasm by Justin Lin (""Fast and Furious"") and is bolstered by the return of the tight ensemble cast including Chris Pine as Capt. James T. Kirk; Zachary Quinto in that fabulous Ringo wig as Spock; Zoe Saldana as Uhura; Karl Urban (a deadpan delight) as Bones; John Cho as Sulu; Simon Pegg (who co-wrote the script) as Scottie and the late Anton Yelchin as Chekov. (The film pays tribute to Yelchin and to the late Leonard Nimoy with subtle class.) As hardcore Trekkers (Trekaholics? Trekadekafanatics?) know ""Beyond"" is the third installment of the alternate timeline reboot that kicked off with the fantastic and simply titled ""Star Trek"" in 2009 and continued with the smashing ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" in 2013. ""Beyond"" picks up some 966 days into the five-year mission of the U.S.S. Enterprise. (Geek alert The original series debuted on NBC in September of 1966 9/66.) Kirk and Spock are questioning their commitment to the mission for very different reasons. In fact the whole crew is in something of a rut. Another day another encounter with an alien life form another threat to the ship and crew another victory another lesson learned about the importance of disparate cultures learning to get along. To what end? Kirk applies for a supervisory position that will ground him. Spock and Uhura are ""on a break."" Spock is driving Bones crazy. Sulu and Chekov are stuck in background shots waiting to deliver what precious few lines they have. Scotties crabby. Maybe this collective funk contributes to the crew of the Enterprise falling for an obvious trap in which a rescue mission leaves them vulnerable and under siege. Forced to abandon ship trapped on a hostile planet teeming with aliens that want to kill them and separated into pairs or alone the crew of the Enterprise has to set aside internal differences and figure out a way to band together to save themselves and of course save the universe because whats a sci-fi adventure without a megalomaniacal villain who wants to blow up all of creation so he can rule whats left of the rubble? In this case the alien villain is Krall played by the great Idris Elba nearly unrecognizable beneath his fantastically cheesy Krall mask and makeup. (It feels as if many of the alien beings in ""Beyond"" are outfitted with deliberately retro rubber masks and old-school costumes which is going to make it easy for Trekkers to duplicate the look for all the Comic-Cons and other Cons to come.) Kralls suitably nuts and Elba has a powerful dramatic scene late in the film when we learn his true motives -- but the real breakout star on that alien planet is Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) who moves like a jungle cat and looks a little like a model in an edgy ad touting Fashion Week. Jaylah is a fierce warrior and shes hot and shes loyal and a little weird and theres just the slightest chance she might be attracted to the nerdy Scottie. In other words shes pretty much every fanboys fantasy woman. At times ""Star Trek Beyond"" gets a overcrowded what with the twin crises Spock and Kirk are grappling with; the apparent death of one character whos still alive; the game of hot potato with the MacGuffin of a device everyone so desperately needs; quick-cut battle sequences where its a bit hard to tell whos shooting whom and a passing reference to Sulus sexuality that happens so fast we barely have time to absorb (and applaud) it. But once the action subsides and we have a chance to take it all in and reflect on what transpired it all pretty much makes sense. In a parallel timeline kind of way.  Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by Justin Lin and written by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung. Running time 122 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sequences of sci-fi action and violence).

Related links Star Trek franchise heads in a new direction By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 523pm on Friday Jul. 22 2016 Friday Jul. 22 2016 Sunday Jul. 24 2016 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Star Trek Beyond the third film in the rebooted franchise isnt a particularly memorable movie by any stretch. In fact it feels more like an elaborate TV episode than a cinematic event.But its a comfortable film for the audience and seemingly for the characters in which the familiar faces dont go anywhere no man has gone before -- boldly or otherwise -- but they seem to be having a rousing good time anyway. Its like hanging out with family on a Saturday afternoon if the family had to go to the edge of the universe and save humanity -- and every other species in the Federation -- once in a while.This time around James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew are looking forward to a little Ramp;R at Yorktown a deep-space Federation outpost where all sorts of sentient creatures great and small can hang out and recharge. Kirk is contemplating whether he wants to make the move to vice-admiral which no doubt would mean more politicking and fewer chances for dalliances with alien women. Similarly Spock (Zachary Quinto) is also at a crossroads having broken up with Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and wondering what his life path should be.Its at Yorktown where director Justin Lin and writers Simon Pegg (who plays Scotty) and Doug Jung let us see that Sulu (John Cho) is gay as he greets his husband and daughter a character twist that set the Internet on fire when it became public. (For the record George Takei who is gay and played Sulu in the original series is against this development. He thinks they should have introduced a new gay character and not reverse engineered so to speak an old one. Lin and company have said they meant it as a tip of the hat to Takei.)But theres not much time for either contemplation or family reunions as theres an emergency that only the Enterprise of course can handle. They have to head back into space to help an ailing ship but the whole thing is just a trap set by the villainous Krall (Idris Elba). He and his minions totally wreck the ship ripping it from starboard to stern making for an impressive display of CGI destruction.Our heroes have to eject landing on the desolate planet of Altamid where they meet up with a stranded female alien Jaylah (Sofia Boutella Kingsman The Secret Service) who is in a similar situation after running afoul of Kraal. Unsurprisingly they unite to try to take down Kraal.The specific plot points matter less than the convivial glue that bonds the characters together. They joke and tease -- and Spock actually laughs -- and whatever their origin everyone comes across as resolutely human. Some of it doesnt make a lick of sense. What are the chances that anyones going to be blasting 90s-era hip-hop tracks Fight the Power from Public Enemy and the Beastie Boys Sabotage on starships two or three centuries from now?But the special effects are particularly explosive -- Lin has directed a couple of the ""Fast amp; Furious"" movies after all -- and Star Trek Beyond moves at warp speed so theres not much time to think about the details.Yet for all of that Star Trek Beyond also leaves a slight aftertaste of dissatisfaction. While its understandable why Lin wanted to make a more human-scale Star Trek without the huge universe-threatening stakes of so many summer blockbusters the scope here is frustratingly small.Kraal despite the usually strong performance from Elba is less all-powerful than he at first seems and theres nothing really jaw-dropping in the entire two hours (though seeing Leonard Nimoy in a photo as well as the last performance from Anton Yelchin who died in June does add a sense of sadness and loss).The overall effect is one of solid contentment rather than electric enthusiasm. Thats not necessarily a bad thing. Much like the relaxing visitors at Yorktown everyone needs to catch a break once in a while.But next time lets reach for the stars.

Photo Everett Collection MOVIE REVIEW Star Trek Beyond Running time 122 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sci-fi action violence). Fifty years on the ""Star Trek"" franchise is still fresh It keeps coming up with new ways to suck. From the corny sermonizing and furniture-quality acting of the original TV series to the senseless ker-blammo of 2013s ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" we now coast on the fumes of lackluster comedy that power ""Star Trek Beyond."" They should have called it ""Star Trek Into Drowsiness."" A menopausal James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) having lost his groove when attacked by poodle-sized gremlins is in a reflective phase ""It can be a challenge to feel grounded when even gravity is artificial"" he says. Deep bro. Meanwhile Spock (Zachary Quinto) and the franchise itself are in mourning for Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy). Spocks relationship with Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is on hold ""If an Earth girl says Its me not you its definitely you"" Bones (Karl Urban) tells him. Hey kids its ""Seinfeld"" in space a blockbuster about nothing. Kirk on the equivalent of an intergalactic mission to save a cat stuck in a tree gets tricked into crashing the Enterprise into the clutches of Krall (Idris Elba) who is one space sprocket away from building an ultimate weapon that never becomes more interesting than a hubcap. Zachary Quinto in ""Star Trek Beyond.""Photo Everett Collection Scotty (Simon Pegg) Bones Uhura and Chekov (Anton Yelchin who died in a freak accident in June) spend half the movie goofing off while Krall instead of killing them all quickly threatens to bore them to death with platitudes. The requisite sexy kick-boxing girl alien (Sofia Boutella) helps the Enterprisers regain the upper hand with an electro-camouflage trick thats as inane as James Bonds invisible car in ""Die Another Day"" and leads to 50 Kirks bedazzling Krall with their macho motorcycle riding. That scene shortly gets topped in ridiculousness by the moment when everyone simultaneously figures out you can make aliens explode by cranking up the Beastie Boys. Co-written by Pegg whose interests run to fond sendups like ""Hot Fuzz"" and directed by Justin Lin who prefers to have metal things crash into other metal things (he directed 15 or 16 of those ""Fast and Furious"" movies) ""Beyond"" is tepid when its trying to be emotional moronic when its trying to be thrilling and unfunny when its trying to be non-unfunny. It lacks a storytelling module Things just click into place when needed as when Kirk commands Scotty to rev up a busted old spaceship Scott says its impossible and 14 seconds later everything is ready to rip. Why is this so hard? Every episode of the 2004-2009 TV series ""Battlestar Galactica"" was better than this movie on a small fraction of the budget. ""Beyond"" gives us 43 more examples of Kirk being inappropriately impetuous and Spock being inappropriately deadpan and expects us to laugh each time. The farther into the universe it ventures the more it feels like its stuck in its own driveway.

(Kimberley French/Paramount Pictures via AP) Being the captain of the USS Enterprise is a post that commands respect and promises adventure. Who wouldnt want to boldly go where no one has gone before?But after a crazy encounter with extraterrestrials James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is seriously considering a career change. Space travel no longer holds the allure that it once did and hes confident that the Enterprise would be in good hands with Spock (Zachary Quinto) at the helm.Kirk is unaware that Spock is also thinking about putting the Enterprise behind him. But before they can have a melding of the minds the starship comes under attack by the mysterious but merciless Krall (Idris Elba). An attack for which the Enterprise is woefully unprepared. The fight continues on a desolate planet where Scotty (Simon Pegg) finds an ally in alien warrior Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) Bones (Karl Urban) struggles to keep an injured Spock alive and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Sulu (John Cho) bide their time among Kralls captives.Kirk and Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin) are free to come up with a strategy to bring down Krall whose plans involve the inhabited space outpost of Yorktown and include destruction on a whole new level. ""Star Trek Beyond"" delivers enough thrills to satisfy fans of the enduring science-fiction franchise -- but little more. Working from a screenplay by Pegg and Doug Jung director Justin Lin (""Fast amp; Furious 6"") seems most concerned with keeping things moving and on that score he succeeds. Pine brings a measured but engaging heroism to Kirk. Quinto is perfect as the logical but charismatic Spock. Urban lends the proceedings a much appreciated dose of humor. And even with his famously expressive face obscured by makeup Elba elevates Krall to something more than a cardboard villain.Space may be the final frontier but its unlikely that ""Star Trek Beyond"" will be our last encounter with the Enterprise crew.What ""Star Trek Beyond""  Three stars out of four  Run time 200  Rating PG-13  Content Sequences of sci-fi action and violence Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com More information 50 reasons we still love Star Trek By Josh Renaud  jrenaudpost-dispatch.com Tags Star Trek Beyond Calvin Wilson Chris Pine Zachary Quinto James T.

Of course ""fast"" and ""furious"" are adjectives that ""classic"" Trek fans loved the series for not being. But in some ways its a relief to leave that more deliberate universe behind. The new slavishly imitative cast members havent made these characters their own and theres an eerie quality to their attempts -- as if the future will bring not just starships and teleportation but also androids replacing long-dead actors. Its better to have a well-made unapologetic action-adventure like this one than a creepy stab at replication. Not that the script -- by actor Simon Pegg and Doug Jung -- doesnt pretend to aim high. Early in Star Trek Beyond Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) stares forlornly into the distance. Hes having a midlife crisis. He wants to leave the untethered world of starships and settle down as an admiral on terra firma -- or anywhere firma. This seemed very strange given that he was handed the command of the Federations flashiest vessel straight out of Starfleet Academy (shouldnt he have served on other ships first?) and that Pine looks as if hed still be carded when buying beer. Spock (Zachary Quinto) too is itching to leave the Enterprise in his case to rebuild the lost civilization of Vulcan. Can these two really be on their way out in only the third movie? It seemed like a setup to me. But you can forget the jacked-up drama once the Enterprise arrives at Yorktown a pretzel-tiered metropolis full of CGI and actors with elaborate makeup jobs in the middle of space. (The scenes were shot in Dubai the continued existence of which seems a shakier prospect than Yorktowns.) From the moment the starship glides into port its clear that Lins visual imagination dwarfs that of his predecessor J.J. Abrams. So what if his shots streak by so fast you can only half-follow the action? Coherence is a small price to pay for beauty. This is like Abstract Expressionism. Most of Star Trek Beyond is set on the blue planet Altamid where the Enterprise is destroyed with sadistic thoroughness taken apart by scores of little ships that swarm and strike like bees. The crew cant reach Yorktown or other starships because a storm has knocked out the phone lines -- no actually its because theyre inside a nebula -- and you know what that means. The characters are thrown to the winds leaving them crashed down on Altamid in groups of two. Kirk and Chekhov (Anton Yelchin) dodge the death rays of a small woman with a large rubber brain-pan and then slide down whats left of the Enterprises saucer section. (It looks like the best water park ride imaginable.) A badly wounded Spock and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) sling insults back and forth before realizing that in the absence of Kirk -- whos like the girl whose attentions theyre fighting for -- they have no reason for resenting each other. Its an especially ridiculous conflict in this new Star Trek series since Quinto doesnt have Leonard Nimoys talent for appearing utterly neutral while curling his eyebrows with unspoken judgments thereby driving McCoy the hotheaded humanist into spluttering rages. Quinto has wounded eyes and lips that quiver petulantly. Hes the kind of Spock who should make McCoy say ""Chill out."" As for Urban hes the Looney Tunes Junior version of DeForest Kelly. The imitation is a hoot but its just that--an imitation. A word about Sulu (John Cho) who with UhuraA (Zoe Saldana) and the rest of the Enterprises ensemble ends up held captive on Altamid In one earlier scene on Yorktown theres a shot of him with his arm around the waist of another man. This is supposed to signal that hes gay which has reportedly troubled the original Sulu George Takei. Takei thinks -- rightly Im sure -- that the revelation has more to do with his own post-Trek celebrity than with the character of Sulu. The only hitch is that there is no character of Sulu. Its ridiculous to speak of the original Sulu or Chekhov or Uhura as if theyre anything but a Japanese-American actor an actor with an embarrassingly fake Russian accent and a leggy African-American actress. The raging camera hog William Shatner made certain that those actors never had anything but the most rudimentary dialogue and Scotty only got attention because of a few memorable catchphrases. Sulu could don a pink angora sweater and it wouldnt affect his ""character."" He and the new more assertive Uhura are blank slates on which to write their own stories. A Pegg meanwhile has written himself a lot of good hysterical Scottish shtick and the movies best scenes feature Scotty and an alien named Jaylah -- a star turn for Sofia Boutella who played the baddie in Kingsman The Secret Service who bisected people with her blade-legs and wholl soon be seen in the title role of The Mummy. Boutella has a good sharp surly face with an improbably delicate cleft chin. Her features register even under a pound of white makeup slashed with black lightning bolts. Kayla is like a kickboxing Pocahontas. More than anything she wants revenge on the movies number-two villain who caused the death of her father. Which brings me to the number-one villain Krall who brought down the Enterprise. Hes a huge guy with a leonine-alien face a thunderous voice and horrendous diction which means I never fully caught his reasons for wanting to destroy Yorktown and everything else that the Federation has polluted. I was stunned to learn that under all that prosthetic muck is the great Idris Elba which suggests the problem with most prosthetics They make actors as dissimilar as Elba and Oscar Isaac look pretty much alike -- and Id so rather look at Elbas (or Isaacs) naked features. Christopher Plummer did the audience (as well as himself) a favor when he refused to submit to six hours of makeup to play a Klingon in Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country and Ricardo Montalban needed nothing more than long white tresses and weights to build up his pecs to play the scariest Trek villain of all. That said I did enjoy the interview in which Elba said his makeup helped him answer the old question ""Whats my motivation?"" His motivation was to blast through his scenes so he could get all that fucking rubber off his face. Despite the complex structure the movie still comes down to two men pounding on each other in a small space while a clock tick-tocks toward Armageddon. At least Lin knows how to shoot his fights from unexpected angles and with enough spatial-temporal variables to keep us jolt-addicts rocking in our seat happy to be dizzy. But Star Trek Beyond is steeped in a larger sadness. Spocks melancholy is triggered by news of the death of ... well Spock meaning the first iteration of Spock meaning Nimoy who died before shooting commenced. (If you havent seen any films in this new cycle you wont have a clue what Im talking about. I barely I have a clue what Im talking about.) The other loss of course was the 27-year-old Yelchin who died after the film was completed and whose obituaries led with his cartoonish Chekhov (with its deliberately phony Russian accent) rather than the other more daring performances he had given in all manner of indie films. But in his final turn as Chekhov hes so exuberant that he practically bounds from scene to scene as if hed finally said to himself ""Chekhov is anyone I want him to be -- and I want him to be madly optimistic and alive."" The thought of his tragically absurd death brings you crashing down to Earth.

Photo Paramount Pictures TNS Beyond is just a routine Star Trek movie 1 / 3 Back to Gallery With ""Star Trek Beyond"" the rebooted ""Star Trek"" franchise that features the original crew of the Enterprise settles into routine sequel territory. This isnt terrible news and it may have been inevitable but its something of a letdown all the same. There has never been a bad movie featuring Captain Kirk and the gang but ""Star Trek Beyond"" belongs with ""Star Trek V The Final Frontier"" (1989) and ""Star Trek The Motion Picture"" (1979) among the weaker entries. There are bright busy ""Star Trek"" movies full of wit and interest and then there are ""Star Trek"" movies like this one that are subdued and dark as if imbued with the monotony of being stuck on a spaceship for five long years. ""Star Trek Beyond"" has an odd lethargy from the beginning. When we meet up with Kirk (Chris Pine) hes talking into his captains log about the psychological oppression of going far into the uncharted universe. Theres a sense of endless pointlessness dislocation and loneliness. This is an odd start but its almost promising in that it indicates something different perhaps a movie-length philosophical rumination on space travel. Then comes the inevitable shift and the Enterprise finds itself drawn into a space battle just outside the known universe. An evil monstrous-looking creature has lured them into a trap. He wants to hold them prisoner on a rocky barren planet and almost as a sideline he wants to demolish a nearby Federation colony. Krall (thats Idris Elba underneath all that makeup) neither sings nor plays the piano. He just dislikes civilization and wants to destroy it on principle. So this is rather a bleak entry. Unlike its two predecessors in the rebooted series ""Star Trek Beyond"" wasnt directed by J.J. Abrams who was too busy lending his sparkle to ""Star Wars 7."" Instead it was directed by Justin Lin best known for his films in the ""Fast amp; Furious"" series. Nor was it written by the team of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman who brought out the series humor in the previous two installments. Rather it was written by Simon Pegg who plays Scotty and Doug Jung (""Confidence""). This is the B-team and it shows. At least this B-team understands what people love about the series the characters -- or specifically the characters and their interrelationships. Kirk Spock and McCoy and to a lesser extent Scotty Sulu Uhura and Chekov have become permanent archetypes so familiar in their idiosyncrasies that all they have to do is act like themselves and the audience feels the pleasure of recognition. Whats more in this new series there is a kind of double pleasure in that Chris Pine is not only giving us Kirk but hes also evoking William Shatner. Zachary Quinto is not just Spock but Leonard Nimoy and Karl Urban is not just McCoy but DeForest Kelly too. So in ""Star Trek Beyond"" we can appreciate the breezy self-assurance of Kirk as he talks with McCoy clearly his favorite colleague and reaches across the species divide to connect with Spock the colleague he most respects. The movie finds opportunities for McCoy and Spock to clash and bond -- they are like oil and water -- and for McCoy to say ""I am a doctor"" just as hes being recruited for something that has nothing to do with medicine. Indeed Urbans amping up of McCoys irascibility is the source for most of the new installments humor. I do wish though that Pine would remember that the key to imitating Shatner is to emphasize the wrong word in a sentence. Thus ""We come in peace"" should be spoken as ""We come in ... peace."" Lin who is at home in action movies gives us too much action in a number of colorless battle sequences (although one in which Krall and Kirk go at it within a light-gravity environment is at least different). Still Krall is a washout as a villain in that he has little reason for his villainy and not much that he wants to accomplish with it. Instead he just talks and talks about how he finds the spectacle of a civil society repulsive as an affront to his values and how he wants to destroy it. As such hes like someone you might read about in the newspaper but considerably less scary. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Those were the days Star Trek as created by Gene Roddenberry was an unapologetic expression of optimism a vow of faith in interplanetary civic values. Its gentle spirit is something we could use more of these days especially during summer blockbuster season and if you can look past a degree of special-effects bombast Justin Lins Star Trek Beyond shimmers with it--the actors in particular carry the essence of Roddenberrys inclusive vision into the present. Star Trek Beyond is designed to dazzle. Its effects--including the sight of a ravaged Starship Enterprise hurtling toward the surface of a mystery planet like a colossal flaming space pie--are sometimes beautiful and sometimes so elaborate that they obscure the action rather than make it more thrilling. Even so Lin keeps this tense adventure (co-written by Doug Jung and Simon Pegg who also reprises his role as chief engineer Scotty) from stumbling over its own excess he knows that any good Star Trek needs wit as well as spectacle. This time the Enterprise with James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) at the helm heads out to save a stranded alien ship only to zoom into a trap set by a villainous megalomaniac named Krall (Idris Elba) easily identifiable by his corrugated blue-green forehead and murderous pointy little teeth. Krall destroys Kirks beloved ship and captures most of his crew though Kirk and some of his officers--including Karl Urbans eternally skeptical Bones Peggs stub- bornly practical Scotty and Zachary Quintos eminently sensible sweetheart-in-disguise Spock--escape the dying ship in cool bullet-shaped space pods that hurtle forth like man-made shooting stars. Kirk stranded on Kralls planet thinks only of saving his crew and luckily he meets another castaway who grudgingly offers help Jaylah--played with grave take-no-prisoners elegance by Sofia Boutella--is a captivating alien with eyes of pale fire and a face like a starkly painted Kabuki mask. The whole point of any Star Trek exercise is that people of different temperaments beliefs and skin tones must learn to work together. The actors here take that rather skeletal mandate and make it gleam. Spock and Bones stuck in a cave for part of Star Trek Beyond bicker and spar like disgruntled stepbrothers before realizing long after we do that their tendency to overthink everything makes them a match in space-bro Heaven--all of their scenes together are a delight. Pines Kirk solemn and solitary is always suffering from some existential crisis this time he wonders if the drag of day-in day-out space travel is killing him softly. But before you can say Bones-like ""Get over it Jim"" something about Pines brand of somber thoughtfulness stops you. After all its not just the weight of the world Kirk carries on his shoulders-- hes also got lots of strange new worlds to worry about. No wonder hes anxious all the time. This Star Trek also gives us a parting glimpse of the late Anton Yelchin who as Commander Chekhov doesnt have much to do this time around but who nonetheless casts a benevolent glow. Yelchin conducted his far- too-brief career with understated nobility whether the work in question was a Shakespeare adaptation or a summer entertainment he poured his soul right in. Thats the difference between going gently and boldly going. He made that idea sing. Tap to read full story Order a Reprint Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Jul. 20 2016 939AM EDT Last updated Monday Jul. 25 2016 228PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Justin Lin Written by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung Starring Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Zoe Saldana Classification PG Genre scifi Year 2016 Country USA Language English When Paramount signed J.J. Abrams to resurrect Star Trek for the next generation (sorry) studio executives surely must have been hoping to boldly go (sorry again) where few franchises have gone before. Aside from the James Bond films (which refresh themselves every decade or so) the Godzilla movies (whose only constant is an arbitrary dude in a kaiju suit) and the Friday the 13th chapters (even ol hockey-mask Jason sat out a few entries) no modern Hollywood series has been as long-running as Star Trek. But to take the brand beyond the original casts - to make it the sleek sexy lens-flare-y product audiences now crave - would be a challenge. Enter Abrams the industry wonder boy adept at turning mythology-dump gobbledygook (Alias Lost) into for-the-masses entertainment. It was a smart hire at first. Abramss simply titled Star Trek was a blast of adrenalin and a clean-slate wipe of the canon that so weighed down the Star Trek legacy. It was zippy fun and even deployed a cute time-travel plot that placated both Star Trek novices and the diehard experts who so carefully monitor any movements in Gene Roddenberrys vast galaxy. But then things fell apart. Star Trek Into Darkness took all that was good about Abramss first film and placed it into a Dumpster which was then set on fire. The villain was fresh but beholden to the old mythology. The plot was gritty purely for grittiness sake and more earthbound than any film with ""Star"" in the title had a right to be. Oh and there was magical blood that solved everyones problems. Something had to be done to correct course or the entire USS Enterprise would crash.So exit Abrams (off to guide some other ""Star"" franchise never really heard of it) and enter Justin Lin. It all made sense on paper - Lin had already turned the Fast and Furious series around when it looked as if Tokyo Drift would die a straight-to-video death. Perhaps he could also help guide Star Trek before it inadvertently hit its final frontier (sorry for the last time I swear) - a reboot of a reboot to couch it in the industrys own language.Happily Star Trek Beyond is much more than a mere refresh. Thanks to Lins steady directorial hand and knack for visualizing improbable set-pieces the new film is bold breathless and propulsive a distillation of the action movie to its purest elements. Which is not to say its merely eye candy - this is a character-forward film too with every key member of the Enterprise getting a storyline to develop and a moment to shine. The film just might be the most balanced blockbuster of the summer.Credit must also go to screenwriters Simon Pegg and Doug Jung. Wisely ignoring most of Into Darkness the pair return to the simple elements that made Star Trek so appealing in the first place crew camaraderie a sense of unbound curiosity an appetite for adventure and most importantly a world that is built upon hope.To that end Beyond kicks things off in the right direction with Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and crew in the middle of a five-year deep-space exploration. Worlds are visited species are catalogued McGuffins are collected etc. But then a ferocious alien named Krall (Idris Elba oozing an easy evil) comes along Kirk and Co. find themselves stranded on an unknown planet and Lins movie becomes an amalgam of the greatest summer-movie tropes a heist film a rescue mission a road-trip movie and a spectacle where things just blow up real nice.In between Jung and Pegg (who returns to play engineer Scotty which is mostly a riff on his Mission Impossible nerd) carve out solid corners of character development plus enough comedy to mistake this for a Galaxy Quest sequel. Even the third-act twist - mandatory these days for franchise entries where the thrill of the familiar is simply not enough - makes a sort of sense or at least more than the terribly telegraphed Khan reveal did for Into Darkness.There is little doubt that some Star Trek fans will find fault with Lins whiz-bang approach - and yeah using the Beastie Boys song Sabotage to save the galaxy is a stretch even in sci-fi - but its impossible to watch Beyond without cracking at least the tiniest of smiles. Now all Paramount has to do is convince Lin and his collaborators to stick around - and avoid the siren calls of that other Star franchise.

Star Trek Beyond Directed by Justin Lin Action Adventure Sci-Fi Thriller PG-13 2h 0m Find Tickets By A. O. SCOTTJULY 20 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Chris Pine left and Idris Elba in ""Star Trek Beyond."" Credit Kimberley French/Paramount Pictures Musing in his Captains Log as his birthday approaches James Tiberius Kirk his eyes as blue as the lens flare that accompanies the first shot of the Starship Enterprise finds himself in a funk. ""Things are starting to feel a little ... episodic"" he confesses in what even a sympathetic viewer might interpret as a meta-statement a confession of franchise fatigue. Chris Pine who has played Kirk since the big-screen reboot in 2009 is on his third voyage. This character originated by William Shatner has endured a lot more. The larger ""Star Trek"" enterprise has been boldly going on for a half-century and more hours of television and cinema than I possess the Googling acumen to tally.So you can understand why James T. a good soldier and also a bit of a loose cannon might want to break out of the rut and the title of the latest movie ""Star Trek Beyond"" teases the audience with the promise of novelty and risk. Its not necessarily a criticism to note that not much materializes. Directed by the action maven Justin Lin from a script by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung the film answers the question ""Beyond what?"" with a diffident ""Well nothing really. Dont worry"" It should have been called ""Star Trek Within"" in honor of its determination to color inside the lines obeying the ironclad conventions of brand and genre. Video Movie Review Star Trek Beyond The Times critic A.O. Scott reviews ""Star Trek Beyond."" By THE BROADWAY CHANNEL on Publish Date July 21 2016. Photo by Kimberley French/Paramount Pictures. Which is not in itself a bad thing. Not every wheel needs reinventing and one of the abiding pleasures of ""Star Trek"" in its old and newer iterations lies in its balance of stubborn consistency and canny inventiveness. The characters never change but the stakes can shift wildly from one adventure to the next. Fans love ""Star Trek"" precisely because of its episodic nature which allows for a certain amount of variation in theme and tone. Sometimes the future of the universe hangs in the balance. Sometimes Kirk and his crew have to deal with local disputes and personnel issues. Or weird random stuff like tribbles or Joan Collins-related time travel.Unfortunately 21st-century big-budget action movies are made according to a more rigid template and ""Beyond"" follows its immediate predecessors ""Star Trek"" and ""Into Darkness"" (both directed by J. J. Abrams) in sacrificing some of the old spirit to blockbuster imperatives. The Hollywood rule book stipulates that the climactic sequence should involve the noisy destruction of a lot of buildings and an extended hand-to-hand fight between the good guy and the main villain. The villain should be motivated by the usual villainous grudge. Millions of lives should be in danger and the actual casualties should be numerous and filmed bloodlessly enough to preserve the PG-13 rating.Up until the tedious and bombastic finish though you can have a pretty good time. In his work on the ""Fast and Furious"" movies Mr. Lin has shown a playful willingness to extend -- and if necessary suspend -- the laws of physics and his visual brashness can be a refreshing antidote to Mr. Abramss fussy tries to combine digital spectacle with old-fashioned cinematic discipline. Video Trailer Star Trek Beyond A preview of the film. By PARAMOUNT PICTURES on Publish Date July 20 2016. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Most important the gangs all here and Mr. Lin proves once again to be an adept ensemble wrangler. Kirk grins and grimaces his way through yet another existential career crisis (and also does some motorcycle stunt driving). Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) experience some love trouble. Spock and Bones (Karl Urban) take their bickering-astronaut vaudeville double act on the road once again. Sulu (John Cho) Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Scotty (Mr. Pegg) provide technical support and comic relief as necessary. Mr. Yelchins sweet mischievous performance seems especially poignant after his death in an accident this year. The film is dedicated to his memory and to the memory of Leonard Nimoy the original Mr. Spock who died in 2015. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On the surface of a distant planet the crew encounters a new nemesis and a new ally. The big baddie is a murderous warlord named Krall (Idris Elba masked). The scrappy sidekick is a stranded fighter named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella in zebra-stripe makeup). Things go more or less as you expect with enough surprises and ""reveals"" to make you mad at me if I say too much more. The crew hops into and out of danger. Machinery fails and is repaired in the nick of time. Highly complicated imaginary science is explained with breathless urgency.Sometimes I have to say the scientific breakthroughs feel a little too convenient. Jaylah has some kind of technology that makes giant spaceships invisible and another kind that shoots fast-drying resin (or something). And there is some business at the end on an enormous space station that I did not buy for a minute. The nerd in me wants a bit more rigor a bit more plausibility underneath the exuberant fakery. Maybe in the next episode.""Star Trek Beyond"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Nothing out of the ordinary. Running time 2 hours.

Only a talking blue fish has earned blockbuster street cred. Something called a Pokemon is a breakout star. Now potential salvation has come in the form of Star Trek Beyond (opening Friday July 22) the third installment in seven years. To use a trite-but-apt phrase it doesnt go where no Star Trek film has gone before. But it is freewheeling enough to entertain a casual moviegoer -- and faithful enough to please a Comic-Con nerd. Chris Pine in Star Trek Beyond. Kimberley French The crew of the Enterprise including Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) Spock (Zachary Quinto) Scotty (Simon Pegg also a co-screenwriter) Sulu (John Cho) Bones (Karl Urban) and Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin) are three years into their five-year exploratory mission. And as Kirk explains everyone is suffering from a serious case of malaise. Spock and Uthura (Zoe Saldana) have split up. (It turns out Vulcans arent dashing romantics.) Kirk wants to give up his title. Theyre all desperate for an adventure. Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles From Star Trek to Alpha Dog While stationed at a sleek star base called Yorktown they get one. An endangered female alien sends a distress call and reports that her ships crew has been taken hostage. They decide to rescue her on a faraway planet unaware theyre being lured into a trap. The resident tyrant named Krall (a menacing unrecognizable Idris Elba) you see longs to get his slithery hands on an ancient chemical weapon -- that happens to be in Kirks possession. His end goal to start a war because he believes peace fosters weakness. He has ulterior motives as well but theyre of the spoiler variety. Zoe Saldana and John Cho in Star Trek Beyond. Kimberley French That ho-hum premise falls more in line with say a first-rate TV episode of Star Trek The Next Generation than an epic two-hour film. Trekkies will be the first to rave that their beloved saga excels at posing deep philosophical ideas and wringing human pathos in outer space. A vengeful-dude-wants-to-destroy-the-world plot essentially describes the story line of 99 percent of all testosterone-fueled action flicks. Wheres the originality? The crew even repeats the same variation of a rescue operation multiple times. No wonder director Justin Lin (taking over for J.J. Abrams) packs in a barrage of noisy special effects -- only one of which qualifies as a true mouth-agape dazzler. (Youll know it when you see it.) Lin is a veteran of the Fast amp; Furious franchise and his overt rock em-sock em sensibilities are evident in every set piece. Indeed one sequence in which Pine takes charge by riding a 20th-century motorcycle might as well have been a deleted scene from Furious 7. Though its only fair to also credit Lin with a soundtrack that thumps with Public Enemy and an ol Beastie Boys favorite. MAC x Star Trek Beauty Collection Is Soaring Into Our Galaxy All the Details Yet for all the state-of-the-art CGI spectacles the movies strength lies in its vintage characters. Theyre as fierce and funny as ever. For most of the second act the splintered crew must partner off and problem solve. This is a rare opportunity for the supporting players to shine -- especially Yelchins quick-thinking Chekhov. Bones and Spock meanwhile are a more potent comedy pairing than Kevin Hart and The Rock. Quips the doctor to his confused Vulcan cohort in the wake of his breakup ""If an Earth girl says Its me not you its definitely you"" (Bones sneers because he cares dammit) This is the 50th anniversary of the original Star Trek series and a disappointing installment would have been an intergalactic disaster. But this is a worthy chapter indeed. And perhaps its only fitting that the most indelible moment of all is a respectful nod to the past. The scene is not only poignant but it truly captures why this legendary franchise remains out of this world.Cant get enough of Us?

He strolls through the halls of his ship observing his crew at work and at play talking about his dead dad over drinks with Bones (Karl Urban) and avoiding sharing his feelings with Spock (Zachary Quinto) whos experiencing some mid-journey malaise of his own. As Kirk notes in his captains log voiceover ""Things have started to feel a little...episodic"" which is basically the TV-series-turned-movie-series-and-back-again equivalent of Peggy Lees ""Is That All There Is?""Star Trek Beyond isnt obviously all there is to space exploration or even all there is to the franchises 2000s reboot which will get at least one more installment with its current cast. But it is a movie about Kirk getting his groove back after a distress call into the clutches of a villain named Krall (Idris Elba) and helping his crew to save a starbase/the world. The trouble is weve barely gotten a chance to watch him get that groove on in the first place. Star Trek Beyond is a snappy diverting affair directed by Justin Lin and written by Doug Jung and star Simon Pegg that nevertheless leaves a lingering feeling like Kirk that somethings missing -- and that thing is the leisurely time span of television (where Trek is headed with new characters and under the guidance of Bryan Fuller in 2017). View this image > Urban and Quinto in Beyond. Kimberley French / Paramount Pictures ID 9269879 Despite the ""episodic"" dig Pines Kirk has never actually had the luxury of weekly adventures on the small screen. Nor has Zachary Quintos Spock Urbans Bones Zoe Saldanas Uhura Peggs Scotty John Chos Sulu or the late Anton Yelchins Chekov. Theyre a TV ensemble without a show and compared to the screen time logged by other Trek crews theyve barely managed a blip together. They are characters whose relationships are built on whats understood to have happened between blockbusters represented in shorthand in Beyond and its 2013 predecessor Star Trek Into Darkness by the in medias res alien encounters that start both films. When we do spend time with them theyre in crisis mode.But its the downtime in the beginning and the exchanges that take place when the characters are split up and stuck on a planet hidden away behind a nebula that are Beyonds most resonant parts -- the parts that feel more like a very expensive episode of TV as opposed to a movie and the parts that create a sense of the time these folks have spent working and living together.Lin taking over directing duties from Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darknesss J.J. Abrams is famous for building The Fast and the Furious franchise into the multi-ethnic extravaganza of batshit vehicular set pieces and heartfelt affirmations of family that it is today. And the most memorable big beats in Star Trek Beyond with the exception of the one that irresistibly repurposes a classic tune for combative ends are cribbed from Lins earlier franchise with characters catching each other midair or leaping off vehicles just as they teeter off cliffs. The rest of the action is disappointingly murky -- what should have been a thrilling sequence involving a huge starship chunk is ultimately hard to make out in the dark and aerial fights hurtling through space dont even offer a sense of where the assailants are in relation to one another. View this image > Elba as Krall in Beyond. Kimberley French / Paramount Pictures ID 9269856 Star Trek Beyond feels almost reluctant to rev up to its inevitable battle with Krall whose intriguing backstory is held back too late making it into a reveal rather than something that could have larger resonances to Kirks search for purpose. As the baddie Elba offers some choice snarls from under layers of prosthetics but he cant make Krall anything more than an also-ran one who is like Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness effectively a terrorist. Star Trek Beyonds themes of turning the peaceful Federation back into a military operation are also recycled from the last installment as if there needs to be some ideology-rattling threat to justify a movie which the series has already exhausted anyway. What Beyond proves is that the need to include as much big mission-questioning action as possible actually gets in the way of what makes Star Trek most pleasurable how its crew interacts with one another and with alien races always bridging differences.The alien newcomer here is named Jaylah and shes played by Kingsmans Sofia Boutella the henchwoman with the deadly prosthetics. Jaylah is also handy with a weapon and she speaks adorably distinctive self-taught English. If there are times when shes reminiscent of the similarly marooned Star Wars The Force Awakens Rey it has more to do with the limited current template for kickass galdom than any intentional aping. (Less fun is how Uhura fades into the background as if theres only room for one prominent female character at a time -- and who knows what befell poor Carol Marcus who gets nary a mention). Mostly Jaylah is an effective new element off of which Kirk and Spock and the other crew members can bounce a reminder that the crew is its own sort of mutable family capable of absorbing new members as well as letting ones go. View this image > Pine Boutella Yelchin and Pegg in Beyond. Kimberley French / Paramount Pictures ID 9269919 For most of its run though Beyond keeps Kirk and Spock Star Treks perfectly matched pair of impulsive instinct and cool logic apart. They are separately grappling with their respective futures each trying to figure out where hes headed if its time to settle down elsewhere and put down roots. The most satisfying moment in the entire film isnt a shootout in a spacecraft or a fight in a gravity stream; its when Kirk and Spock both arrive at the same understanding without ever needing to talk it out. After all why would you ever want to leave the Enterprise this ship thats its own patchwork community hurtling through space toward the unknown? Its the journey thats the point not the destination and its the ongoing experiences in Star Trek that make the franchise not the big universe-quaking ones.

(Kimberley French/Paramount Pictures via AP)MoreIn the previous ""Star Trek"" installment Spock cried. In the latest ""Star Trek Beyond"" he laughs. And not just a little snicker either but a belly-full one. What bold explorations into the farthest reaches of the galaxy hold for Spock no one knows. A sigh? A hiccup?""Star Trek Beyond"" like most of the rebooted properties flying around our movie theaters delights in nostalgically resurrecting iconic characters and tweaking them anew. The balance is a delicate one as seen in the pre-release debate around this film revealing Sulu (John Cho but formerly played by LGBT icon George Takei) as gay.The scene in question turns out to be a mere moment lightly handled showing Sulu greeting his same-sex partner and their daughter after a long mission. Its all expressed with just a few arms tenderly draped across shoulders. And its the kind of welcome touch that director Justin Lin the ""Fast amp; Furious"" veteran who takes over for J.J. Abrams has brought to this pleasingly episode-like installment.The opening scene fittingly plays with a smaller scale. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) on a diplomatic mission appeals to a snarling beast looming above him in a crowded amphitheater. Enraged at Kirks offer the alien beast hurtles down upon him only to turn out to be no more monstrous than a feisty bulldog.The film finds a bored Enterprise finishing up a five-year tour in deep space. The (albeit brief) change of pace is immediately appreciated. The last two beefed-up ""Star Trek"" movies as if overcompensating for decades of Trekkie nerd-dome threatened to make the once brainy ""Star Trek"" less distinct from other mega-sized sci-fi adventures -- just another clothesline of CGI set pieces strung together.Like its recent predecessors ""Star Trek Beyond"" is mostly an assortment of effects-heavy scenes with bits of talking in between. But unlike the previous film 2013s bloated ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" not everything is quite so much of a life-and-death issue (the exhausting de facto pitch of todays summer blockbuster).The Starship Enterprise led by Captain Kirk (Chris Pine looking more natural in the role) is lured through a nebula where a would-be rescue mission turns into a trap set by the villain Krall whose spectacular army of mechanical drones (""bees"" he calls them) attack in an overwhelming swarm. In a galactic blitz the Enterprise is torn to shreds and crashes down on a rocky planet where the ships scattered crew tries to gather survive and understand Kralls motives. A local becomes an essential guide for them Jaylah (a nimble Sofia Boutella) a pale loner with black streaks running down her face who helps the crew discover the Federations history on the planet.The backstory though never quite gets filled out and the plot serves as little more than a mechanism to test the efficient camaraderie of the Enterprise crew. Among them Zoe Saldanas Uhura Simon Peggs Scotty Karl Urbans Bones and Chekov played by the late Anton Yelchin a fine actor whos disappointing underused here. Theyre an entertaining enough bunch meandering around and screenwriters Doug Jung and Pegg (who as the writer of ""Spaced"" knows plenty about the intersection of comedy and science fiction) have injected some humor to the proceedings.The heart of the film though like the previous two is the bromance between Kirk and Zachary Quintos Spock. Theyre Felix and Oscar in outer space and still the highlight of this batch of ""Star Trek"" films.Its only late in the film that the alien mask is pulled away revealing the actor underneath Krall Idris Elba. For those who didnt place his baritone earlier the reveal comes as a disappointment. It should be a crime in deep space as it is on Earth to shroud such a tremendous force behind mountains of extraterrestrial makeup. But I suppose had Elba been an unadorned baddie all along the Enterprise might really have finally met its match.""Star Trek Beyond"" a Paramount Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""sequences of sci-fi action and violence."" Running time 122 minutes.

Abrams the odd-numbers-bad/even-numbers-good rule of thumb for Star Trek movies has been reversed? Technically the 13th Star Trek movie Star Trek Beyond sees the universe of Kirk Spock and Bones regain its footing and sense of fun (even amidst mayhem and casualties) courtesy of some talented filmmakers who are admitted Trek nerds. With producer Abrams stepping back to direct a certain Star Wars movie the helm was handed over to Justin Lin (late of the Fast and Furious action franchise). And though the action-packed trailers might suggest he simply launched that manic vibe into space Lin and scriptwriters Simon Pegg and Doug Jung made a clever plot move that gives Beyond the most breathing room for its characters in years. The gimmick put the crew in a situation where they have to abandon the Enterprise and deal with each other and their predicament in small groups. Youve got eternal antagonists Spock and McCoy (Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban) coming to a bickering understanding youve got Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin) proving himself to his father-figure Kirk (Chris Pine) by showing a previously unexplored knack for MacGyvering. And youve got the feistiest Uhura (Zoe Saldana) yet nose-to-nose as a captive of a vampiric alien villain named Krall (Idris Elba). The other element in this newfound chemistry is Pegg who added a plethora of laugh lines (the most since Star Trek IV The Voyage Home) and keeps one foot in the original TV series with every exchange of dialogue. Indeed the very first ""Captains log"" in the film has Kirk describing the Enterprises 966th day in deep space (kudos if you know what that number references) and the feeling that every day has become ""episodic."" There is a bored feeling to the crew and we discover thoughts of moving on entertained by more than one beloved character. Calm... meet storm. The Enterprise on an ostensible mercy mission is set upon by an unstoppable swarm of alien drones and well... youve seen the trailers. But the dynamic of everybody on the bridge interacting mainly with Kirk is punted. Exactly who Krall is is a slow reveal. And given everything else that is done so well in this movie ultimately a bit of a hard swallow. Still if any hardcore Trekker is being honest weve swallowed worse. There are MacGuffins theres MacGyvering theres emotional investment (Sulus male partner and their daughter live on an imperiled space city). And theres the first new character in a long time worthy of continuing in the series (which appears to be the set-up). The warrior-ish Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) - whose name was actually inspired by Jennifer Lawrence - is matched up with Scotty (Pegg who selfishly gives that tandem some of the best lines). Shes a longtime fugitive from Krall who has jury-rigged a crashed Federation ship into her ""home"" becoming a fan of onboard 20th Century hip-hop in the process. Im not sure if the spoiler police will lay charges but I will reveal here that the Beastie Boys Sabotage has a part to play in saving the universe. Which makes perfect sense to me.

"Star Trek Beyond review Fun reboot makes the little things count - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Star Trek Beyond review Fun reboot makes the little things count Trailer for Star Trek Beyond Watch the official trailer for ""Star Trek Beyond."" (Paramount Pictures) Watch the official trailer for ""Star Trek Beyond."" (Paramount Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""Things have started to feel a little ... episodic"" acknowledges the commander of the USS Enterprise in his famous captains log three long years into a five-year 23rd century gig.That line cheeky and knowing comes early in ""Star Trek Beyond."" Its the 13th feature film pulled from the hallowed Gene Roddenberry TV series the Cold War-era phenomenon that believed in ideas and the democratic ideal as opposed to its cultural bookend the vastly more influential ""Star Wars"" universe which from its inception was driven by merchandise and nostalgia. I generalize of course and millions can dwell in both worlds and live a full happy life. But there it is. Intergalactic or earthbound so many franchises fight for our attention these days that its easy to forget how satisfying the recent J.J. Abrams-directed ""Star Trek"" films starring Chris Pine as Kirk Zachary Quinto as Spock Karl Urban as ""Bones"" McCoy and Simon Pegg as Scotty have been. (Also John Cho as Sulu; Anton Yelchin who died earlier this year as Chekov and Zoe Saldana as Uhura.) The latest produced by Abrams and directed by ""Fast and Furious"" alum Justin Lin isnt quite up to the 2009 and 2013 movies. But its still fun you still care about the people and the effects manage to look a little more elegant and interesting than the usual blue blasts of generica.MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR Pegg co-wrote the script with Doug Jung and while the storyline and the scope of the action is more in line with the pre-digital TV series the sense of humors a pretty fair trade-off. The nemesis this time is a lizard fellow named Krall played by Idris Elba which means he has the coolest voice in the universe. Kralls desperate to regain control of the plot device known as the ""Abronath"" also referred to as ""the death machine."" The Enterprise takes a fatal hit from Kralls swarming flying spacecraft and much of the first half of the picture finds Kirk Spock et al. stranded and separated on a forbidding spiky-rocked planet.The gang reassembles with the help of fearsome warrior alien Jaylah (Sofia Boutella making with the martial arts whenever she gets enough screen time). The object of Kralls wrath is a huge glass-enclosed federation stopover known as Yorktown which sounds like its a mall (meetcha at the Yorktown Mall) and looks a little like the ""Logans Run"" bubble with more open spaces. On Yorkville both gravitational forces and the upside-down-and-sideways architecture are inspired by M.C. Escher which makes for some entertaining combat.Its the little things that count in ""Stark Trek Beyond."" The casual details two or three seconds at a time include Sulu meeting up with his boyfriend and their daughter Spock enjoying an atypically hearty laugh at one point and Kirks accumulating air of world-weariness which tones down the characters hot-headed qualities. Pines a good actor but its a tough assignment How does any Kirk cope with the role as written while suggesting when appropriate the old William Shatner arrogance?Theres a moment in ""Star Trek Beyond"" when Kirk receives congratulations for another job well done. Tipping his hat to his fellow crew members he says ""It isnt just me. It never is."" But the look on Pines face suggests an unspoken additional line ""But actually it is just me."" Director Lin stages a seriously nutty sequence involving multiple Kirks riding multiple motorcycles which I suspect will prove to be the dividing line for many in the audience. Either you like that bit or you dont.Lins movie works best when approached as a relaxed somewhat playful two-hour expansion of one of the old 60s episodes. Krall never quite pops as the antagonist Elba so clearly has in him to portray. But if theres one thing this franchise has taught us across six decades its this You cant always get a Khan when you want one.mjphillipstribpub.com Twitter phillipstribune""Star Trek Beyond"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of sci-fi action and violence)Running time 202Opens Thursday eveningRELATED STORIESStar Trek Beyond John Chos character Sulu is openly gayStar Trek actor Anton Yelchin killed by own car at age 27Star Wars vs. Star Trek The authoritative judgment Caption Trailer Bad Moms Watch the trailer for ""Bad Moms.""

Abrams in the latest entry which is closer in spirit to the original TV series.Karl Urban plays Bones in ""Star Trek Beyond.""(Photo Kimberley French)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3.5 out of 5 starsJust three films into a rebooted franchise ""Star Trek Beyond"" goes retro and if that sounds like a snake eating its tail or some other convoluted notion bear with me.It pays off. (The film. Not bearing with me necessarily.)RELATED J.J. Abrams on Trek Anton Yelchin That kid was special | Goodykoontz remembers Anton YelchinJ.J. Abrams gave the franchise a new spin in 2009 going back to the future for a younger Capt. Kirk Spock Bones etc. at the start of their careers. Through great casting and a willingness to dispense with slavish devotion to the original TV shows canon Abrams breathed new life into ""Star Trek."" Hard-core Trekkies hated it of course but you cant please everyone.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your device""Star Trek Into Darkness"" the first sequel was less successful but by no means a disaster. It didnt extinguish the possibility of more fun in space.Zoe Saldana and John Cho star in ""Star Trek Beyond."" (Photo Kimberley French)And thats what ""Star Trek Beyond"" delivers. Abrams departed for another nice little space franchise (perhaps you saw ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" the most-successful movie of all time) turning over the directors chair to Justin Lin best known for some of the ""Fast amp; Furious"" franchise. (Abrams is still a producer.) That means a lot of action but whats most notable about the new film is how closely it hews to Gene Roddenberrys original TV series at least in spirit.Credit that to screenwriters Doug Jung and Simon Pegg the latter of whom plays Scotty.Chris Pine plays Captain Kirk in ""Star Trek Beyond."" (Photo Kimberley French)A funny prologue finds the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise rescuing Capt. Kirk (Chris Pine) from a goofy crisis. When all is well we find Kirk and Spock (Zachary Quinto) mulling their futures. Spock learns that Ambassador Spock has died (a nod to the late Leonard Nimoy; more on that later) and wonders whether he should try to help repopulate Vulcan.Kirk meanwhile celebrates a birthday which will make him one year older than his father when he died. Three years into a five-year mission hes also growing a little restless with each day resembling the last (except for all the aliens and adventures one would guess). He goes so far as to say its feeling ""episodic.""Love it. Thats the wink and the nod that tell us Jung and Pegg and Lin get it. Time to blast off.Zoe Saldana plays Uhura in ""Star Trek Beyond."" (Photo Kimberley French)A ship makes an emergency arrival asking for the Enterprises help. Its a set-up of course (this is a spoiler only if youve never heard a story before) leading to the real showdown against a vengeful alien bent on destruction (arent they all)? Krall is his name and hes played by the great Idris Elba though for 99 percent of the movie he may as well not be so hidden is he under make-up and voice manipulation. Still good to know hes in there somewhere.The core crew winds up on Kralls planet in separate escape hatches. That means Spock and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) have to fight their way to the others when not fighting with each other; that Scotty and Jaylah (Sofia Boutella who steals the movie) an alien stranded on the planet have to figure out how to escape; that Kirk and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) must figure out how to defeat Krall. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Sulu (John Cho) just get captured.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestIn other words this is the plot of a bunch of ""Star Trek"" TV episodes only with a massively larger budget for better special effects and Lin is good at those. That is not a complaint its a compliment. The actors in their third time around are comfortable with each other in a way the TV crew always seemed to be (though behind the scenes that wasnt necessarily the case). Pine in particular mixes William Shatners arrogance with a sense of fun.Anton Yelchin (left) and Chris Pine star in ""Star Trek Beyond."" The movie carries a dedication to Yelchin who died June 19 2016 after filming was completed. (Photo Kimberley French)Nimoys death is acknowledged as is Yelchins in genuinely moving fashion. Chekov is in the movie a lot making his loss all the sadder.But ""Star Trek Beyond"" is not a downbeat affair. Instead its a knowing nod to the past fused with a contemporary cast confident in the present and where the franchise might take it in the future.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Simon Pegg Sofia Boutella and Chris Pine star in Star Trek Beyond.(Photo Kimberley French)Hows this for boldly going where no one has gone before The best character in Star Trek Beyond doesnt wear a Starfleet outfit Bones is just as cool as Kirk and Spock and hip-hop is used as a plot point.Director Justin Lins new sci-fi voyage (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) with the starship Enterprise veers off the course of J.J. Abrams previous two big-screen Treks in that it feels more like an expensive two-hour episode of the original TV series rather than a Star Wars-y epic. Thats not a bad thing overall -- what is unfortunate is a momentum-killing middle and a main villain who fails to be interesting until a thrilling third act.Beyond catches up with James Kirk (Chris Pine) when the Enterprise captain is in the doldrums and questioning his career trajectory three years into the ships five-year mission. Its difficult to feel grounded ""when even the gravity is artificial"" Kirk says lamenting the fact that things are ""feeling episodic"" over shots of Scotch with medical officer Bones McCoy (Karl Urban).USA TODAYStar Trek Beyonds Jaylah is based on Jennifer Lawrence in Winters BoneTheir mundane daily life picks up quickly after a distress call arrives from a science team on an uncharted world. The Enterprise sets off to the rescue only to discover its a trap set by a mysterious alien villain named Krall (a menacing Idris Elba).His fleet rips up the Enterprise like space piranha leaving Kirks crew scattered on this strange planet The captain and Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin) investigate the inhabitants Sulu (John Cho) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) are nabbed by Krall Bones tends to an injured Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Scotty (Simon Pegg) meets Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) a native female warrior whose home is an abandoned Starfleet ship. (Blasting on the old sound system Public Enemys Fight the Power.)Bones (Karl Urban) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) are in a bad way on an alien planet in Star Trek Beyond. (Photo Kimberley French)Boutella is amazing as this new heroine with quasi-tribal facial features and a pragmatic demeanor She holds her own with Kirk but also comes with a tragic backstory. Of note too is Urban as Bones; his grumpy scene-stealing nature has been seen in spurts in the two Abrams movies but the doctor comes into his own here.Pegg and Doug Jungs script adds a lot of surprising humor -- Kirk doesnt have trouble with Tribbles but does get into a funny fight with some tiny Teenax. Lin showcases action chops honed on four Fast amp; Furious movies in the gravity-defying climax where Kralls origins are revealed -- and none too soon because the bad guy spends most of the film as a one-note foe devoid of Elbas usual intimidating charms.USA TODAYSimon Pegg respectfully disagrees with George Takei over gay SuluStar Trek Beyond doesnt have the same vision of Abrams films so it doesnt really seem like a continuation in a sense. Yet it does recapture the exploration motif plus the emotional and social underpinnings of Star Trek past We see Sulu embrace his husband and child in a moment thats fleeting but touching and Spock takes time to process the loss of Spock Prime played by Leonard Nimoy in the previous films as an in-movie tribute to the late Trek icon. (The film also is dedicated to Yelchin who died last month at age 27.)The galactic adventure might be an uneven one but the combination of gravitas a little mirth and old-school Trek themes makes Beyond a decently entertaining trip to the final frontier. 2290 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 47 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/29MPViU",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/07/17/review-star-trek-beyond-movie/87222720/,200,startrek39,startrek,usatoday

From ""Fast amp; Furious"" director Justin Lin; produced by J.J. Abrams. In theaters July 22. (Credit Paramount Pictures) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The crew of the Enterprise boldly goes into uncharted space on a rescue mission. CAST Chris Pine Karl Urban Zachary Quinto Zoe SaldanaRATED PG-13 (some rough action and gruesome images)LENGTH 200BOTTOM LINE An enjoyably old-fashioned entry in the new series. Short on back story long on action loads of fun. In ""Star Trek Beyond"" the third entry in the newly rebooted franchise the young crew of the Starship Enterprise enters uncharted space to rescue a missing ship. What they find is something unexpected -- an ancient and powerful force. Its called fun. advertisement | advertise on newsday Thats been missing from this summers blockbusters which have been filled with angry Avengers exhausted X-Men and other super-serious superheroes. The ""Star Trek"" franchise fell into that trap with its last installment ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" (2013) which went heavy on pathos. Youll find little of that here. Relying mostly on its fine cast time-tested characters and flashy action sequences from director Justin Lin (the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise) this new ""Star Trek"" feels like a souped-up version of the old show and its thoroughly satisfying. StoryParamount Pictures announces 4th Star Trek filmStoryJohn Cho Sulu is gay in Star Trek BeyondPHOTOSStar Trek characters then amp; now The film opens with a classic setup Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) is bored Spock (Zachary Quinto) has split with Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Bones (Karl Urban the franchises secret weapon) feels this once-tight crew drifting apart. A new death-defying adventure is exactly what they need and theyll get it when they crash-land on the planet Altamid. There they encounter a hulking new villain Krall (Idris Elba) who spouts the usual Nietzschean theories -- ""Without struggle youll never know what you truly are"" -- to justify his usual doomsday plans. That story is neither original nor profound and perhaps for both reasons it works. Everything we came to see we get The coolheaded Spock bickers with the irascible Bones; scrappy Scotty (Simon Pegg) stumbles upon a striped-faced Amazon alien Jaylah (an intriguing Sofia Boutella); and Kirk thinks his way out of impossible scrapes (some more plausible than others). There are also moments of poignancy some of which come whenever Anton Yelchin who died in a fluke accident last month appears as the loyal Pavel Chekov. The films one surprise -- already spoiled on the internet -- is that Sulu (John Cho) is revealed to be gay. That move has caused some controversy but everybody should just relax. Theres a husband an affectionate hug and thats all. You can probably handle it. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Star Trek Beyond"" fails a few plausibility tests even within its 23rd-century setting but not enough to gripe about. Its old-fashioned entertainment in a slick new package that should satisfy ""Trek"" fans of any era. 4 films with Beyond in titleThe latest ""Star Trek"" movie is going where none of its predecessors has gone -- ""Beyond."" Here are four other movies that ventured one step beyond and maybe went too far. BEYOND THE FOREST (1949) -- Bette Davis left Warner Bros. after making this camp classic in which she played a raven-haired sexpot whos bored with her small-town doctor husband (Joseph Cotten). Its also the movie where Davis uttered the immortal line ""What a dump.""BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (1970) -- Film critic Roger Ebert penned the screenplay for Russ Meyers sexploitation flick about Hollywood sex and drugs that had nothing to do with Jacqueline Susanns ""Valley of the Dolls."" Still any movie that features the Strawberry Alarm Clocks ""Incense and Peppermints"" cant be all bad.BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (1979) -- In this sequel to the 1972 hit ""The Poseidon Adventure"" the capsized ocean liner turns over with six survivors still on board. Even an all-star cast headed by Michael Caine and Sally Field couldnt keep this movie from sinking at the box office.MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985) -- Mel Gibsons third turn as the post-apocalyptic hero Max found him dealing with saving children the energy crisis and a ruthless queen named Aunty Entity played by Tina Turner.-- Daniel Bubbeo Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Abrams really proud of gay Sulu in Star Trek Beyond If youre looking for a witty workplace sitcom set on a futuristic starship the latest exploits featuring the crew of the Enterprise Star Trek Beyond wont disappoint. But it has to be asked Is that really why most of us go to see a Star Trek film? The third installment since J.J. Abrams seamlessly rebooted the beloved sci-fi franchise seven years ago Beyond is more fun than deep. Its lightweight zero-gravity Trek that is for the most part devoid of the sort of Big Ideas and knotty existential questions that creator Gene Roddenberry specialized in. You could argue that the philosophical political and sociological subtext is what always set his universe (and its big- and small-screen iterations) apart from other tech-heavy space adventures. Maybe thats why Beyond feels slightly insubstantial. Say what you want about Abrams who directed the last two Trek movies but hes always been Hollywoods savviest and most attuned makeover artist. Whether he was spit-polishing the Mission Impossible saga in MI III or course-correcting Star Wars with the whats-old-is-new The Force Awakens hes always had an intuitive grasp of the hearts and minds of diehard fanboys and girls. He knows what they want and gives it to them. Abrams is just a producer this time around. The directorial reins have been passed to Justin Lin a giddy rockem sockem daredevil best known for helming the best of the Fast amp; Furious films. And maybe thats the problem. Hes a maestro of visceral thrills and giddy superficiality but thats always been a secondary or tertiary concern with Trek. It also might not have helped that Beyonds script was co-written by Simon Pegg - an unassailably zealous Trek disciple who moonlights on-screen playing engineer Scotty but whose behind-the-scenes credits skew towards the comedic. In Beyond Lin brings his action chops and Pegg the back-of-the-classroom humor but whats missing is something thats harder to manufacture soul. As the new film kicks off Chris Pines Captain Kirk is on a diplomatic mission with a hostile council of pint-sized aliens that goes awry in slapstick fashion. And even though Pine has gotten better and better at capturing William Shatners tongue-in-cheek Shatnerness with each outing its an ominously shaky start. It plays more like a lost scene from Galaxy Quest than Trek. When he returns to the Enterprise Kirk explains through voiceover that after a long haul in deep space he and the rest of the crew are mired in a bit of a funk. The aimlessness of their five-year mission has resulted in a sort of spiritual drift a malaise. Crewmembers with too much time on their hands have been swept up into workplace romances spats and a general loss of purpose. What they desperately need is an assignment with stakes. And shortly after docking at a glitzy new Federation starbase they get one. A female alien who sent an urgent distress call reporting that her ships crew had been attacked and taken hostage by a hostile warrior race led by a barking belligerent figure named Krall needs their assistance. Since the baddie is played by Idris Elba (virtually unrecognizable at first beneath heaps of reptilian latex and putty) our hopes are raised. Its up to Kirk and Co. to take him down. As the familiar faces saddle up (Pines Kirk Zachary Quintos Spock Zoe Saldanas Uhura Peggs Scotty John Chos Sulu Karl Urbans Bones and the late Anton Yelchins Chekov) the Enterprise navigates through an awe-less nebula and squares off against Krall whos after some mysterious alien weapon of mass destruction that might as well just be called ""The MacGuffin"" or ""The Whatzit."" Without treading into spoiler territory the crew of the Enterprise beam down to their new enemys planet and are partnered off into teams of two to all play their part in thwarting the barking avenging Krall. But you begin to wonder What is Krall avenging? Wheres his Khan speech? Being hip to his motivation might have helped up the stakes of the story. But it isnt revealed until way too late in the film. Meanwhile the ""Big Ideas"" found in the best chapters in the Trek canon are nowhere to be found. Instead what we get are mini-arcs of character development The on-again/off-again romance between Spock and Uhura; the love-hate bond between Bones and Spock; the subtle and well-handled revelation that Sulu is gay (no surprise to anyone tracking Trek news lately... but its still a resonant moment). These are by far the best moments in Beyond. After so many missions spent with the crew of the Enterprise its interesting for fans to get a glimpse into their lives beyond the bridge. And even some new faces such as Sofia Boutellas kabuki-skinned alien she-warrior Jaylah are well drawn and exciting additions. Ultimately Beyond is a movie about characters - and character. But thats half the battle. The other half of the battle is... battle. And Lin who has such a strong track record with vehicular mayhem doesnt bring his ""A"" game. The entire rescue mission turns out to be a bit of a bust - and kind of a silly one too with eye-rolling rib-nudging anachronisms that feel totally out of place in this franchise. The music of Public Enemy and the Beastie Boys turns up on the soundtrack in ways that I suspect will give some strict-constructionist Trekkers a cardiac infarction. And Kirk jumps on the back of an antique 20th-century motorcycle at one key moment to go all Steve McQueen in The Great Escape. (As an aside this is the second time in the last three films when Pines Kirk either gets behind the wheel of a Detroit muscle car or on top of a chopper. Once I can buy. Twice just seems... weird. I get that maybe Pine likes going fast on cool old-school toys but this is supposed to be the 23rd century. Maybe he needs to exercise this passion in a different more contemporary franchise). I dont want to sound too nit-picky and churlish. But the Trekverse is something that really means something to people. For them Beyond is a fine movie its just not a very good Star Trek movie. After all as summer releases have gotten more and more and sensational and trivial the Trek franchise could always be counted on to serve up some smarts along with its sci-fi action beats. With Beyond it feels like just another summer tentpole with not enough going on underneath the tent.

Abrams-ified Trek era. That is to say its the one that feels the most like a turbo-loaded episode of the original series and has at least some of that classic spirit of exploration and derring-do. Thats not to say the film is cerebral mind you; the Abrams reboot pretty much did away with the allegorical topical angle of Gene Roddenberrys creation cross-breeding it with Star Wars-style space opera. The Trek of the so-called ""Kelvin Timeline"" that were now in is less about traveling to distant worlds to learn valuable lessons regarding society and more about running through corridors and leaping off big high moving things before the madman destroys the city/planet/space base/cosmos/whatever. This one still falls heavily on action-adventure as Hollywood demands of all modern blockbusters. But somewhere in there you can sense a template taking shape for how this series might proceed -- and its a familiar welcome one.Director Justin Lins main claim to fame is being the guy who helped turn the Fast and Furious series from a tired gearhead B-movie franchise into a knowingly cartoonish wildly profitable action fantasy. So it comes as a bit of a surprise to discover that he slows things down in Beyond. In Abramss two Trek films even the ostensibly ""quiet"" moments moved with a kind of breathlessness the camera whip-panning and caroming down hallways and highways and across space -- almost as if the director wanted to exorcise the calm downright stagy earnestness of the original series. (In his first Star Trek this worked marvelously; in the second all the screaming and running and jumping started to get tedious.)Film Details Star Trek Beyond RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time122 min. Showing Today In74 Theaters More Info Trailer EXPAND Kimberley French This time especially early on the story lets the characters reflect on things like duty identity and regret. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) gets practically existential as he stalks through the USS Enterprise watching his crew go about their lives (in slow motion) and notes in voiceover that ""it can be a challenge to feel grounded when even the gravitys artificial."" He then asks ""If the universe is truly endless then are we not striving for something that is forever out of reach?"" Pine sells these cornball ruminations better than William Shatner ever did.Kirks feeling restless; now a year older than his father was when he died (which also happens to be Kirks birthday -- see the first movie) the captain wants to leave space exploration and become a vice admiral. Spock (Zachary Quinto) is still mourning the loss of his planet Vulcan (again see the first movie) and is faced with his own mortality when he learns of the death of his much older alternate-reality self Ambassador Spock (if this confuses you dont even ask...but yeah see the first movie). Their melancholic reveries are interrupted by the arrival of an alien claiming to be a survivor from a science mission trapped deep inside an asteroid-filled nebula. EXPAND Kimberley French So off the crew goes on its rescue mission...and Im not giving anything away by saying that it all turns out to be a trap. And Im not giving too much away by saying that the films first act ends with a heartbreaker as a terrifying swarm of tiny claw-like spaceships destroy the Enterprise. Thats not exactly new territory for Star Trek -- or blockbusters as a whole whose creators in recent years have proved nauseatingly obsessed with stakes-raising. But theres still something genuinely moving about watching that beloved old ship sliced and diced -- and much of its crew sucked out into space. These harrowing moments also pay off those earlier oddly indulgent slo-mo shots of the crew.Most of the surviving crew is then imprisoned by a mysterious alien named Krall (played by Idris Elba hidden under layers of makeup that would make Oscar Isaacs purple pharaoh of doom in X-Men Apocalypse tsk). The planet theyre on is woodsy and craggy and sometimes even kind of fake-looking -- which Ill choose to interpret as an homage to the original series cheap sets and not a failure of production design or special-effects work. EXPAND Kimberley French The rest of the film follows Kirk Spock and others attempts to save their colleagues get off this deadly planet and foil Kralls dastardly plan. This struggle also involves a beautiful rogue hip-hop-loving alien named Jaylah (the Algerian dancer and actress Sofia Boutella who played the whirling blade-footed assassin Gazelle in Kingsman The Secret Service) an old spaceship a vintage motorcycle some creative teleporting and judicious use of the Beastie Boys ""Sabotage"" which may be the unofficial anthem of the rebooted Star Trek movies. (A ten-year-old Kirk blasted it from a stolen car in the first film.)Im not sure theres anything particularly original about any of this but Lin thrives on making cliches breathe again; he proved with his Fast and Furious films that he knows how to convince audiences of the sincerity of prepackaged Hollywood sentiment. (This time I was half-expecting Kirk to start talking about his ""familia."") And while he may have seemed like a counterintuitive choice to take over a Star Trek movie Lin is absolutely in his element whenever the film becomes about bodies and vehicles moving swiftly through space -- which is often. Part of the climax involves a dizzying elaborate multi-vehicle chase in an ornate interstellar settlement whose gravitational structure seems to have been designed by M.C. Escher. Its gonzo silliness but when a director has this much fun its hard for his audience not to.

"Star Trek Beyond Review Pine Quinto Lead a Serviceable Sequel | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Star Trek Beyond Owen Gleiberman Chief Film Critic OwenGleiberman 42 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Paramount July 15 2016 | 1200PM PT Director Justin Lin brings his bravura action energy and a certain nostalgic flair to the Star Trek series even as he unboldly goes where too many have gone before. It doesnt take a rocket scientist to see why director Justin Lin was handed the reins of the ""Star Trek"" series from the outgoing J.J. Abrams. Lin the director of four ""Fast and Furious"" films is a virtuoso at making vehicles fly through space and his ""Star Trek Beyond"" has a few of the most spectacular set pieces ever seen in the series. Whats more if you had to find a theme in the ""Fast and Furious"" films -- apart from their real theme which is that speed and destruction rock -- it would be this A motley crew of multiculti ego-driven auto pilots works best when they make themselves into a team. Yet its not until the halfway point of ""Star Trek Beyond"" when Lin stages a sequence that truly seems to get his juices flowing. Were in the jagged wilderness of a foreign planet where the Enterprise has crash-landed after being cut in two by a swarm of metallic space ""bees."" The swirling bees are controlled by Krall (Idris Elba) a dictator with the face of a lizard and the voice of a warlord and an attitude to match. He gets energy by literally sucking the life out of people and hes out to capture an artifact that was on board the Enterprise an ancient clicking doohickey he wants for terrible (but unspecified) reasons. The crew of the Enterprise dispersed on the planet is trying to regroup and now at last they have it together enough to launch a plan of attack. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) provides the diversionary activity riding a chopper around Kralls woodland headquarters his biker image literally multiplied a dozen times. Meanwhile a leonine alien named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) whose black-etched-on-white face makes her look like Darth Maul by MAC Cosmetics engages in hand-to-hand combat with Krall whomping him with kung fu kicks. The sequence has that Lin spin that overdose of activity that gets you pumped. And thats a good thing -- or at least its good up to a point -- because ""Star Trek Beyond"" for all the addictive intensity of its visual flourishes is the most prosaic and in many ways the least adventurous of the Abrams-era ""Star Trek"" outings. Its a sturdily built movie that gets the job done and its got a likable retro vibe The fact that Kirk and his crew spend a good part of the film stranded without recourse gives ""Star Trek Beyond"" a wide-eyed slightly clunky analog stasis that takes us right back to the spirit of the TV series. Like the show it lets us share quality time with cast members who now seem like old friends. Yet to say that the movie fails to break new ground would be putting it mildly. It truly feels like an extended episode without a single ""Oh wow"" trick up its sleeve which may be why until the eye-popping climax its more earnest than exciting. To be fair a ""Star Trek"" movie -- this is the 13th -- cant be expected to reinvent the wheel each time. Abrams already did that once and he did it brilliantly casting the series with such an acute eye for the inner qualities of every ""Trek"" crew member that you almost feel as if each character should come with a little book entitled ""The Zen of Scotty"" ""The Zen of Bones"" etc. Yet the dimension of the original series that turned fans into lifelong cultists is that it pushed and poked boundaries; it kept spinning your head. Thats what Abrams tried to do in his two films and the underrated ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" though it played a bit of a shell game with ""Trek"" mythology casting Benedict Cumberbatch as a young Khan who didnt completely parse as the Khan of legend was still a movie that took you on a sinister cosmic joyride. ""Star Trek Beyond"" might have been more accurately entitled ""Star Trek Contained."" Its got a very familiar old-fangled no-mystery structure and thats because its basically the ""Star Trek"" version of an interplanetary action film with a plot that doesnt take you to many new frontiers. But theres plenty of chance to hang out with a cast that audiences have -- rightly -- come to love. On the planet the crew members land in different places because theyve escaped the crashing Enterprise in separate pods. Its fun to watch Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban) bond through their antipathy. Or Scotty (Simon Pegg) try to weave his nerd weaselness around the forceful Jaylah the alien dominatrix in white who refers to him as ""Montgomery Scotty."" Or Anton Yelchins Chekov simply be in every scene his ardently antic Chekov self which allows us to revel in what an inspired job the late young actor did of making Chekovs face match his heavily accented words his eyes popping in comic communion with his vowels. Yelchin a superb actor (he is honored in the closing credits with a simple ""For Anton"") slyly disappeared inside this role and in that very act of disappearance he was never more himself. Conveniently the planet houses the carcass of an old Federation ship the U.S.S. Franklin which our mighty crew can resuscitate. From there the battle heads to Yorktown a Federation outpost thats like a gyroscopic steel-and-glass city that resembles an amalgam of the aristocratic satellite in ""Elysium"" the city of the future in ""WALL-E"" and an Apple store. Its a lurching multi-planed vertiginous place and Lin stages the protracted final battle there like a gladiatorial contest suspended in the air. Its a sequence you wont soon forget. What is forgettable perhaps is everything else about the movie which doesnt so much advance the ""Trek"" cosmology as keep it running in place. ""Star Trek Beyond"" opens with Kirk and Spock each having a private existential meltdown Kirk from the every-day-is-like-the-last-day routine of piloting through space and Spock from the knowledge that he might want to ditch the Enterprise to become a Vulcan patriarch now that Commander Spock has died -- a nod to the late Leonard Nimoy whom Quinto inspiringly echoes in the hint of warmth masked by his impish ultra-deadpan. You can rest assured that this team will become a team again because thats the message of the movie that in space (or maybe anywhere) a crew of quirky oddballs beats a scaly megalomaniac every time. But thats kind of a lesson that we already knew. ""Star Trek Beyond"" is a somewhat diverting place holder but one hopes that the next ""Star Trek"" movie will have what it takes to boldly go where no ""Star Trek"" movie has gone before.

Sean Daniel-Ennis says July 28 2016 at 312 pm Im not sure the reviewer actually understands Star Trek. Star Trek was always about character interactions and veiled(sometimes not so veiled) social commentary. The action was built on top of that. This is the first Star Trek movie in the new series to actually give the ensemble cast time to interact and play off of each other. Its the first to make even a rudimentary attempt at having an overarching message- Strength and peace in unity over divisiveness conflict and xenophobia. Given our current political climate in the US and EU its a fairly relevant message. Im not saying the movie was perfect but out of the new series its the most ""Star Trek"" out of all of them. Also it gets bonus points for all of the Star Trek Enterprise callbacks. Reply Navycross says July 28 2016 at 743 am I dont agree with everything in this review but I can say that the movie was not written well. The character development was weak cliche after cliche story/plot was formulaic and simplified for a very young audience (13 and under). It was the first Star Trek movie I have seen where I was looking at my watch thinking how much longer till we can go eat? The CGI seemed to lack a realism we have seen in past films. Tough to put a finger on everything but Star Trek works because of the relationships and the characters themselves the CGI and everything around it should help colour in the rest. Scotty/Bones I believe had more screen time than Kirk it seemed. The key to a successful franchise is the importance of each film in that series. If a viewer can simply pass over a film in that series will they have missed something integral to the story its characters etc. Star Trek Beyond is one you can pass over and not have missed anything when this series of films has run its course. Sure there was some entertainment value but we are beyond just needing another enterprise crashing and burning. Reply Clairvoyant says July 26 2016 at 1252 am What I find disappointing are the usual ""racist subliminals"" in yet another American movie. You know umm lets see oh yeah the ""black"" guy is the villain - and of course hes using borrowed technology. Cant have them inventing their own. And then theres the ""black woman"" helpless symbolically chained and freed by her ""white"" nerdy lover. Wait oh wow whod have guessed the ""white"" guys do all the brain work heavy lifting and are the heroes of the movie. Apart from the same old sinister racial propaganda from Hollywood the movie was humdrum mindless entertainment for people wanting to kill some time but dont mind soaking up the crappy subliminals. Meh. Reply steely says July 27 2016 at 825 pm Stop being so butthurt... not everything is about race so stop making it. Reply George Cartwright says July 24 2016 at 248 pm A very repetitive review. The Critic did everything in his lapse of the English language to get the job done. It is a review but nothing more. Poor in every sense of the word. Look elsewhere for information on this film.... Reply troublewithhammers says July 24 2016 at 453 am Good review Honestly this was the worst Trek movie Ive ever seen so overloaded with cliches and plot holes that it was obviously made by people who thought sci-fi meant putting car chases in space and calling it a day. Spoiler warning... Why didnt the main villain (whose name is too stupid to type) use his extended lifespan and extensive technology to leave the planet? Why was a marooned Starfleet captain blaming Starfleet for not answering a message they obviously never received? Who was the race that found the missing piece of the super-weapon how did they find it and what were they doing with it before Kirk got it? Why did the planet on which the villain and his pseudo-Jem-Hadar were marooned have all that deadly technology on it ie who left it there and why? How far did Sulus husband and daughter travel to meet him at that base if the Enterprise had been exploring for three years? Why did Mannis the villains right hand man show some reluctance to kill Enterprise crew members but seem excited about killing another innocent woman who had been marooned on the planet? Speaking of her how did she generate the power to cloak the Franklin for YEARS right under the nose of a well-armed enemy with a boatload of scanning equipment? Why did no one seem all that upset by the fact that about half the crew of the Enterprise probably died in the fighting or their subsequent captivity? Is entering Starfleet really as easy as somebody ""pulling some strings"" since I seem to remember that even supergenius Wesley Crusher had some trouble getting in? Theres a lot more but I think thats enough to prove my point that this movie has no business existing in a franchise known for creativity and philosophical storytelling as much as space-battles. Reply millerfilm says July 24 2016 at 705 pm My brother and I have seen all the ""Trek"" films. But we just saw ""Beyond"" today and havent been able to stop talking about how messed up it is Reply Chris says July 23 2016 at 1117 am ""a leonine alien named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) whose black-etched-on-white face makes her look like Darth Maul by MAC Cosmetics engages in hand-to-hand combat with Krall whomping him with kung fu kicks."" She didnt fight Krall. She fought the guy who killed her dad while Krall went off to go get Yorktown. Reply Greg Price says July 22 2016 at 355 pm Assuming your statements are entirely accurate its a good thing we had a bit less ""oh wow"" and a little more solid characterization. As it is were still stuck with the stupid motocross sequence. JJs penchant for paper thin plot dressed up in shiny mystery boxes had done a great deal of damage to the Trek brand by barely functioning as a bridge between noisy Michael Bay rip off scenes. Reply G. Blake says July 22 2016 at 916 am """"Star Trek Beyond"" might have been more accurately entitled "" Really? It is titled one thing and is ""entitled "" to a review as you are ""entitled"" to w rite one. You are writing for Variety and you make a juvenile mistake Really? That pretty much discredits your opinion as being uninformed or formed in the mind of a child. Have a little respect for journalism. Reply JJneveragain says July 25 2016 at 942 pm From Dictionary.com entitled to call by a particular title or name What was the book entitled? When you criticize anothers language the onus is on you to be accurate even more so than the person youre criticizing. You failed. Reply tlsnyder42 says July 21 2016 at 1244 pm Meh. . . why do so many ""critics"" seem to miss the real good points as well as the real bad points of movies and television programs? This kind of superficial review is easy to do. Reply Ivan Sicard says July 21 2016 at 1151 am The movie was great (4 out of 5). A nice balance of action character development and story. This review however is poor (1 out of 5) and does not reflect the movie or the Star Trek series. Did Gleiberman even watch the movie or understand the 50th year anniversary and progression of Star Trek? Perhaps Gleiberman just made up some generic messages to get his review done in time. Unprofessional. Reply Likeucare says July 20 2016 at 952 am Your review breaks no new ground. It regurgitated the same tired tropes used by so many other movie bloggers. 1 star. Reply Michael says July 20 2016 at 447 am Interesting review. The Star Trek Beyond that I just saw at the cinema was obviously not what Gleiberman saw. In my cinema people were laughing cheering respectfully silent ... and absolutely enthralled by what they were watching. It was a marvelous experience. Maybe the subtlety was too much. Star Trek is going boldly ... and good on em Reply Certs222MN1 says July 20 2016 at 315 am I got the Batman vs Superman Blu-ray today. Its awesome. If the new superman accidently destroys a city I can deal with it but its harder to deal with the collateral damage in the last ""Star Trek"" movie. Captain Kirk violated the Prime Directive a few times in TOS but he never accidentally leveled an office building on earth. Reply buyfdaapproved says July 20 2016 at 1246 am I didnt like the movie so dead boring i was surprised they have to make another sequel Im so sick and tired of remake  STAR TREK movie  please enough is enough. NO MORE Reply Likeucare says July 20 2016 at 954 am Wow. Really? Now the button hurt bat boy clan are going to troll starvtrek?Dude its not even a super hero movie. Reply MatthewJ4738 says July 18 2016 at 640 pm Lost me at ""underrated Star Trek Into Darkness."" Reply millerfilm says July 18 2016 at 706 pm He had to write that because he couldnt publicly say ""what-the-%-was-that Star Trek Into Darkness."" Reply meiray says July 17 2016 at 840 am I dont remember Gleibermans EW reviews being quite this spoiler-filled. I dont undertstand why Variety and THR cant be more oblique about plot specifics. Reply Profzed says July 17 2016 at 1249 am ""...a ""Star Trek"" movie... ...cant be expected to reinvent the wheel each time. Abrams already did that once and he did it brilliantly casting the series with such an acute eye for the inner qualities of every ""Trek"" crew member... "" Wow. I wish I could have seen the JJ Abrams Trek movies that the author of the review saw. The JJ Abrams Trek movies I saw (first one in the theater the second one I waited for the DVD to show up at my local library) clearly proved that Abrams had no clue whatsoever as to the original Trek characters ""inner qualities"". Abrams also had no clue (nor did he care) as to what Star Trek has always stood for or what it truly is. (Just as long as non-Trek-fan adolescent boys get all the action they can handle and none of that stupid ""who cares"" story/plot - that makes you actually think - to get in the way.) Reply Stan says July 16 2016 at 1055 am You really should warn us that thi review is full of spoilers. I good movie review can be done without revealing plot points. Reply Tom says July 16 2016 at 1143 am There were spoilers? Reply IT--II--IT says July 16 2016 at 623 am A franchise slum is -- NOT -- an enterprise. And certainly NOT any kind of FREE enterprise. Reply Tony says July 16 2016 at 229 am This is a ""Film Review"". I would say more but - Reply Odinson says July 16 2016 at 1229 am Why dont you tell us MORE about key plot points and events of the movie jackass....?? Reply millerfilm says July 15 2016 at 816 pm Comfortably Familiar sounds better than the what-the-% messing with tradition ""Into Darkness."" Reply stevenkovacs says July 15 2016 at 609 pm I AM SO GOING TO SEE THIS Reply BillUSA says July 15 2016 at 508 pm Ill pass. The whole Star Trek thing ended for me when Kirk died in ""Generations"". Reply Alex says July 15 2016 at 303 pm Action and a lot of CGI doesnt cut it anymore ""STAR TREK"" needs Joss Whedon. Reply Isaac Hill Sr says July 15 2016 at 159 pm Star Trek into darkness is an absurd rendition of what Star Trek and its original characters portrayed. Advanced special effects and prolonged scenes of violence will never rescue it from its absurd and demented characterizations. Captain Kirk is portrayed as a foolishly daring and reckless youth and someone who would have sex with an animal being. That is enough said in my opinion. Two thumbs down.. Reply Merrill Jones says July 15 2016 at 137 pm Being butthurt isnt a review. Reply JOE S HILL says July 15 2016 at 125 pm While the visual effects are well madeJJ Abrams ""STAR TREK"" movies are no where like the original movies with the original castand the storylines hereare just so damned ""Anti-TREK"" given that Abrams was never a fan of the original TV seriesor its valuable story and timelines when ""STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS"" was released in 2013the movie was a huge disaster not only did they botch and ruin the valuable timeline involving the ""Khan"" characterwhich was badly castbut this other bullshit with the two Spocks of present and future-what was that supposed to be? i meanits always great to see the late Leonard Nimoy in his iconic rolebut the same characters present and futureexisting in the same time space? totally absurd and this other stuff about the ""Kelvin timeline""so Abrams wants to honor someone from his personal lifebut what actual relevance does it have in the Franchise? ill stay with ""STAR TREK The UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY""(1991) one of the finest and last of the original cast and moviesbefore ""STAR TREKGENERATIONS"" (1994) came on board as for ""STAR TREK BEYOND""ill see for myself what Justin Lin does hereand ""Fast and Furious"" that this will be-but so farit hasnt altered my opinion of Abrams previous moviesnor do i expect this oneto be any different Reply BillUSA says July 15 2016 at 513 pm I think J.J. Abrams was put on this Earth to destroy the two most popular space-based movie franchises. He has accomplished that mission with gold-standard execution. Reply Orean Keels Jr. says July 15 2016 at 115 pm As you as you praise ""spectacular set pieces"" in context of Star Trek as a compelling reason for it to be good you prove that you have no freakin idea what youre talking about. Reply Mitch says July 15 2016 at 110 pm Sounds lame. Hope it bombs. Reply David Murphy says July 15 2016 at 1247 pm Enjoyed the review. I think Vulcan is gone (from the modern first Abrams movie?)? OR maybe I missed something? Reply BillUSA says July 15 2016 at 511 pm Vulcan is indeed gone but I have a vague recollection of reading somewhere that the is a new settlement called Vulcan. Dont hold me to it beer and boxing have taken their toll on the old noodle. Reply Jon Silman says July 15 2016 at 1234 pm I was gonna say ""somebody went to grad school"" but its Owen so my b hes earned that shit a million times over. This actually sounds like the movie equivalent of a baseball game. You know what youre gonna get but its comforting nonetheless. Reply Carlo says July 15 2016 at 1223 pm Well Owen make up your mind. You liked it or you didn""t like it. Typical of most critics; they really dont like to say anything that might resemble a good comment. And like most critics probably have never been on a set or have the slightest idea of what it takes to make a film either good or bad. Most of them have their noses stuck in books or in theaters watching stage plays. I dismiss most of their comments as a real lack of knowledge. Reply Tom says July 16 2016 at 1147 am You have to have been on a set to have an opinion? Really?

Nearly 50 years later it still is. And thats particularly clear in ""Star Trek Beyond"" the third film in this franchises 21st-century reboot and a movie that re-establishes its core beliefs character camaraderie and long-lasting appeal. MORE A few words with Zoe Saldana Thats not surprising. The script was co-written by Simon Pegg (who also co-stars again as Scotty) a sci-fi fan and seriously committed ""Trek"" lover. He knows what people want to see - Kirk being heroic Bones and Spock sniping at each other Scotty fixing the unfixable. Because ""Star Trek"" was never really about the science-fiction. It was always first about the people. Of course that doesnt mean there arent plenty of starships photon torpedoes and alien worlds here. Or aliens (many of whom in a nicely nostalgic touch seem to be decked out with the same kind of crude latex-and-yak-hair makeup as the ones on the original show). The screenplay though gets back to basics. The first re-done ""Star Trek"" introduced some confusing time-travel issues and parallel Spocks; the second brought back the great villain Khan but devolved into an overdone orgy of destruction. MORE A few words with Zachary Quinto This story though simply sends the Enterprise out on a rescue mission - then watches as its suddenly attacked. The Enterprise is abandoned most of the crew is captured the top officers escape and a mysterious new supervillain emerges - the iguana-faced Krall who like supervillains everywhere is eager to get his hands on a weapon of literally cosmic destruction. Krall unfortunately isnt the most interesting of bad guys (a problem this new franchise has had since the beginning) and although hes played by Idris Elba the stars face and distinctive voice are hidden under pounds of scales and a bad-guy rasp. But the movie has a break-out character in Jaylah a white-faced alien with awesome fighting skills and a scrappy confidence. Played by Sofia Boutella the personal assistant/assassin from ""Kingsmen"" she gives the boys-club world of sci-fi even more of a necessary jolt than Daisy Ridley gave ""The Force Awakens."" And there are some other good touches including a nicely handled tribute to the passing of Leonard Nimoy and the briefly controversial revelation that Sulu is gay. Thats a perfectly appropriate touch though and the objections by some - including George Takei - that it runs counter to the original series is nonsensical. The films in this new alternate franchise have already turned Khan into an Englishman killed Spocks mother and put the non-emotional Vulcan in a relationship with Uhura. You accepted all that but Sulu having a husband twists you up? The movie falters occasionally in other areas. New director Justin Lin imported from the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise is better at big things crashing into each other than the simple choreography of fistfights; some character motivations arent clearly defined. And - although this was unavoidable - every time the late Anton Yelchin shows up on screen as the eager Chekhov its hard not to feel a small pang. But the other stars are all terrific - after three films together Chris Pines Kirk Karl Urbans Bones and Zachary Quintos Spock have found a comfortable groove. Some of the special effects are stunning. And while this is not your fathers ""Star Trek"" it still feels like a fans - and just the kind of warm inclusive feel-good entertainment this summer needs. Ratings note The film contains violence and mild language. Star Trek Beyond (PG-13) Paramount (120 min.) Directed by Justin Lin. With Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Idris Elba.

TWITTER 7/22/2016 Director Justin Lin assumes command from J.J. Abrams on this third installment of the sci-fi series reboot which pits the Enterprise crew against a brutal Idris Elba. J.J. Abrams reanimated a dormant sci-fi franchise for the big screen with his propulsive 2009 origin story Star Trek but then shifted into neutral for the humdrum 2013 follow-up Star Trek Into Darkness a regimented blockbuster that felt hollow and heavy beneath all its noise and brawn. With Fast amp; Furious veteran Justin Lin stepping in as director the third reboot installment Star Trek Beyond regains momentum and not just in the obvious area of its muscular action set-pieces. The script injects a welcome strain of humor thats true to the original Gene Roddenberry creation delivering nostalgia without stiff veneration. The previous two installments grossed a collective 853 million worldwide for Paramount and this latest entry -- opening July 22 in the 50th anniversary year of the TV series debut on NBC -- should significantly sweeten that haul. Whether it will satisfy rabid Trekkers remains to be seen though even for casual followers (like me) the films double dedication packs an emotional punch. An end credits title card reading ""In loving memory of Leonard Nimoy"" is followed by a separate card that states simply ""For Anton."" Both those tributes are echoed in the movie itself in a brief but eloquent farewell salute to Nimoys Ambassador Spock (and later to the entire original crew of the Starship Enterprise) and in the boyish enthusiasm and optimistic spirit of Russian shipmate Pavel Chekov played by Anton Yelchin in one of his final screen appearances before his untimely death last month at age 27. Scenes that show the young Chekov looking up to Chris Pines Captain Kirk when they are stranded together on a hostile planet acquire added poignancy. The script by Simon Pegg (expanding his duties beyond his onscreen role as engineer Montgomery Scott) and Doug Jung also provides a stirring reaffirmation of the original 1960s vision of a utopian fantasy ruled by traditional Federation ideals of peace and intergalactic unity. That makes the much-debated revelation of a gay Sulu (John Cho) entirely germane to the spirit of a liberal-leaning series that presented one of the first interracial kisses on American network TV. While Sulus partner (played by co-writer Jung) has no dialogue hes seen three times with the couples daughter in the populous Federation starbase Yorktown upping the stakes for Sulu when that idyllic multicultural future-world comes under threat. Home and family have always been important motifs in the Star Trek mythology and the pleasingly unemphatic presentation here of a gay family unit is a natural progressive extension of the inclusive universe that Roddenberry conceived. Hysterical homophobes and traditionalists need to shut the hell up. The menace that threatens all that harmony surfaces three years into the Enterprises five-year deep-space mission in the form of Krall (Idris Elba) a fearsome alien eager to get his hands on an ancient ""death machine"" artifact of which Kirk and crew are custodians. Krall believes the Federations reign of unity has brought weakness whereas war and struggle breed strength. Kirk and Spock (Zachary Quinto) both are in the midst of introspective crises and contemplating big changes. Kirk is approaching a birthday that will make him older than his father lived to be; Spock is compelled despite his feelings for Uhura (Zoe Saldana) to return to his people and help repopulate New Vulcan. But those concerns get pushed aside when a vicious attack by Krall leaves the Enterprise crew stranded without a vessel and dispersed on the rocky desert terrain of Altamid an inhospitable planet surrounded by an unstable nebula. This allows for some amusing interplay among the core characters outside of their familiar group dynamic. Kirk and Chekov land with the suspicious alien who got them into the mess (Lydia Wilson); Bones (Karl Urban) and a seriously injured Spock are flung down elsewhere to banter in their respective personae as voluble joker and emotionless literalist; Sulu and Uhura are taken prisoner by Krall along with the bulk of the Enterprise crew; and Scotty teams up with Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) a zebra-faced alien also stranded on the planet and living in an abandoned Federation ship. A technical whizz and a take-charge fighter with impressive kickboxing moves Jaylahs look has a touch of Iggy Azalea but her taste in music runs more toward the vintage hip-hop of Public Enemy ""Fight the Power"" being her anthem of choice. Shes a terrific new addition to the ensemble played with a sexy sneer by the lithe Boutella. She also seems a promising potential love interest for Scotty in future installments if only hed stop calling her ""lassie."" Lin directs with his foot often jammed on the accelerator careening from one physical or aerial clash to the next where the densely packed movie could sometimes stand to take a breath. But even if a team of four editors would normally spell trouble the pacing structure and crescendos of suspense are assured with Michael Giacchinos forceful score pumping up the action. However theres also no shortage of intimate character-driven moments. And while the story isnt without confusing elements as warmongering intergalactic blitzes go its coherent enough. Shot by Lins regular Fast amp; Furious collaborator Stephen F. Windon the visuals take robust advantage of the big Imax canvas and the special-effects work is first-rate even if the trippy bee-like swarms of Kralls destroyer pods become somewhat unrelenting as an image of enveloping darkness. However that yields a strategy to disorient the swarm by blasting them with some Beastie Boys at max volume -- ""Is that classical music?"" asks a perplexed Bones -- which feeds into the films affectionate embrace of throwback relics from a dusty motorcycle to an antiquated Federation spaceship from the distant 2160s. One of the chief strengths of the reboot series remains its appealing young cast who approach their iconic characters with respect while keeping their performances loose enlivening their camaraderie with reciprocal warmth and understated humor. Elbas fierce charisma at first seems obscured beneath layers of prosthetic armor and a Darth Vader-esque heavy-breather voicebox (there are nods to both the Star Wars and Alien universes). But the actors powerful physicality is evident throughout and he gets to explore a fuller range in the climactic scenes as Kralls true identity is revealed. While Beyond wont unseat 1982s thrilling The Wrath of Khan as the gold standard for Star Trek movies its a highly entertaining entry guaranteed to give the franchise continuing life.

Abrams pulled when recreating ""Star Trek"" was assembling the first cast in the propertys long history with charisma to rival the original crew led by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. Abrams energetic 2009 reboot powered through any story and character issues on the strength of pure personality. Justin Lin achieved a similar feat in the ""Fast and Furious"" series building a sprawling character ensemble into the main attraction of the franchise. That experience made Lin a smart choice to take the helm of ""Star Trek"" after Abrams teleported away to ""Star Wars."" Indeed Lins first spin in the Enterprise is cut from the mold of his muscle-car sequels as it opts to exploit the casts facility with their Starfleet personas rather than boldly going where no ""Star Trek"" has gone before. See Video Star Trek Beyond New Trailer Blows Up the Enterprise ""Star Trek Beyond"" a phrase that is title and tagline in one doesnt much capture the tone of this action-oriented mission. The title suggests a far-flung adventure in space perhaps something along the lines of the hardcore science fiction of ""Star Trek The Motion Picture."" In fact ""Beyond"" is quite familiar with a structure that marries modern blockbuster form to a plot outline that could easily be at home in the 1960s original series. A distress call leads Kirk (Chris Pine) Spock (Zachary Quinto) and crew deep into a nebula (from which naturally communication is cut off) an encounter with a foe of overwhelming power the destruction of the Enterprise and a scramble to escape an alien planet. The crew is splintered into disparate pairs gruff Bones (Karl Urban) and logical Spock learn to trust one another; the complementary Kirk and Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin) move the plot forward; Scotty (Simon Pegg who also co-wrote with Doug Jung) encounters resourceful warrior Jaylah (Sofia Boutella ""Kingsman The Secret Service"") who like the Enterprise crew has fallen victim to angry villain Krall (Idris Elba). Also Read Will Virtual Reality Ever Be Like the Holodeck on Star Trek? (Guest Blog) After indulging an extended early setpiece in which the Enterprise is attacked by Kralls swarming fleet of drones Lin nimbly cycles through each of those duos in succession punctuating their survival efforts with expository scenes featuring Uhura (Zoe Saldana) Sulu (John Cho) and other Enterprise survivors held by Krall. The spotlight steadily pans across the collective training on moments of doubt comedy and triumph. Some stories are told in a single shot as when Sulu is briefly reunited with his husband (played by Jung) their relationship told in the easy movement of a walking embrace. With the 2009 reboot and 2013s ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" behind them the ensemble is confident and mature in this revamped vision of the well-known crew. Most impressive is newcomer Boutella whose chiaroscuro warrior is fierce smart and memorable. Boutellas action chops seen previously in ""Kingsman"" arent exploited to a satisfying degree but in every other regard shes the films standout. Screenwriters Pegg and Jung open ""Beyond"" with Kirk detailing the monotony of years in space days that blend into a grey mass routine tasks taking over petty interactions blown out of proportion. Its an effective illustration of an aspect of ""Trek"" that is often ignored in the feature films and an introduction to Kirks maturity as he wrestles with comparisons to his father. ""Beyond"" sees several characters grappling with responsibility to family and the weight of loss and pays dignified homage to the late Leonard Nimoy. Anton Yelchin who died in an accident a month prior to the films release is honored by his significant screen time and effective performance. See Video Star Trek Beyond Cast Share Dubsmash Moments With Anton Yelchin Still this is an action movie at its core if also a less frenetic film than the prior two Abrams efforts. At times Lins camera takes the idea of zero gravity literally floating tilting and swooping over ship hulls across craggy rock faces through the ruined Enterprise. The motion suggests both grace and instability but at times seems designed simply to avoid the grey corridors of TV ""Trek."" Lins visions fare best when writ large. The sweep of an attack on the Enterprise is dizzying and intense; the spectacle of a moon-size space station designed like a spheroid set of Moebius strips in which gleaming skyscrapers grow ""up"" towards one another is among the best images of Starfleets utopian achievement. The director is willing to set aside logic in favor of movement and energy -- its best not to wonder precisely how some of Jaylahs combat devices work for example because the movie isnt interested in explaining. Also Read Comic-Con Does Star Trek Beyond Outdoor Screening Risk Worse Piracy? Without a TV series to bridge long gaps between movies each new ""Trek"" film has shouldered the burden of being many things to a large and varied fanbase. ""Star Trek Beyond"" forges a path right down the middle of the franchises well-defined lane playing more like a greatest-hits compilation than anything new. Given the various low points in the 13-film series thats not a bad thing. This episode cuts right to the core of the series original appeal giving the terrific cast a chance to play against one another in a straightforward story. Its not exactly bold but ""Beyond"" does satisfy. Email Star Trek 101 The Weirdest Episodes From Tribbles to the Rock (Videos) ""Star Trek"" has become known as a series filled with serious examinations on ethics and philosophy. But with over 700 episodes over five series there are bound to be some that... to put it charitably... are completely insane. Here are the weirdest ""Star Trek"" episodes ever ranging from fun classics to writer-room monstrosities. ""Spocks Brain"" -- The quintessential weird ""Trek"" episode. An alien race steals Spocks brain so they can use its logical abilities to run their dying planet. Whats the Enterprise to do? Dr. McCoy hooks up a device to his head so they can move his body with a video game controller until they can get his brain back. ""The Way To Eden"" -- A mad scientist and his cult of followers hijack the Enterprise so they can use it to find a mythical paradise planet. Thats right. Kirk has to take on space hippies. Welcome to the Trekkie spin on the Summer of Love. ""Arena"" -- This episode is considered to be one of the original series classics and features Kirk entering a trial by combat against a reptilian monster called the Gorn. It makes this list for featuring a showdown between Kirk and the Gorn that... shall we say... looks silly by modern standards. Still those who suspend their disbelief and modern perspective will be rewarded. ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" -- This is arguably the funniest ""Trek"" episode ever made. Lt. Uhura receives an adorable tribble as a pet for the Enterprise. Things get crazy quickly when the tribble starts multiplying and eating all the food onboard leading to the hilarious sight of Kirk getting buried in the fuzzy critters. ""The Naked Truth"" -- Another goofy classic. A strange disease infects the Enterprise crew and destroys their inhibitions causing them to start acting irrationally. George Takei calls this his favorite episode of the series as he paraded around as a shirtless sword-wielding Sulu. ""Spectre of the Gun"" -- As punishment for invading the territory of a reclusive alien species the Enterprise crew is sentenced to death via a reenactment of the O.K. Corral. Why the O.K. Corral? Who knows? ""The Savage Curtain"" -- In a similar episode Kirk and Spock are forced by some rock aliens to take part in an experiment of good versus evil. Their tag team partners on the ""good"" team are the legendary Vulcan leader Surak... and Abraham Lincoln. ""A Fistful of Datas"" -- ""Trek"" returned to the Wild West in ""The Next Generation"" with an episode in which a power surge causes all the characters in Worfs cowboy holodeck simulation to look like Data. Once the kooky charm of seeing Data in 1880s attire wears off this episode is just a confusing mess. ""Hollow Pursuits"" -- Frustrated with his lot on the Enterprise Lt. Reginald Barclay becomes addicted to his holodeck simulations in which the main cast acts horrifically out of character. This makes the list thanks to Barclays creepy fantasy of Troi as ""the goddess of love and compassion."" ""Fair Haven"" -- Romantic holographic fantasies arent just for beleaguered lieutenants. Theyre for the captain of the Voyager too In this episode Janeway enters a simulation of an Irish town and falls in love with a simulation named Michael Sullivan. She even starts editing the program to make Sullivan into the kind of guy whos more her type. ""Manhunt"" -- Back on ""TNG"" Counselor Trois mother Lwaxana wants to find a new husband. Whom does she set her eyes on? Captain Picard. Of course the fastidious captain is able to make a clean getaway. ""Take Me Out To The Holosuite"" -- ""The crew of Deep Space Nine forms a baseball team."" Thats not the premise for some wacky fan fiction. That is an actual episode of the darkest ""Star Trek"" series in which Captain Sisko rallies his crew to take on a team of Vulcans. ""Move Along Home"" -- Quark is forced to play a complicated board game with hidden rules and his game pieces are Sisko Kira Dax and Bashir. How are the heroes of ""Deep Space Nine"" going to get out of this deadly game? By playing alien hopscotch ""Tsunkatse"" -- ""Star Trek Voyager"" had its initial run on UPN which at the time had another major ratings magnet ""WWF Smackdown."" This episode was the networks attempt to merge the two for ratings with The Rock making a cameo appearance as one of the gladiators Seven of Nine is blackmailed into fighting. Previous ; Next 1 of 15 Tribbles holodeck fantasies and Abe Lincoln are a part of the goofy side of the ""Star Trek"" universe ""Star Trek"" has become known as a series filled with serious examinations on ethics and philosophy.

Eric Kohn Jul 15 2016 300 pm erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""Star Trek Beyond"" Paramount Pictures Despite an expansive universe stretched across over a dozen feature films and numerous television series the appeal of ""Star Trek"" is pretty straightforward a motley group of colorful characters hurtle through mini-adventures in deep space sustained as much by their chemistry as the variety of alien civilizations in their path. The first two films in the rebooted franchise attempted to raise the stakes with various cataclysmic events threatening its cast of fresh faces but ""Star Trek Beyond"" goes back to the television roots. Spectacular as it looks this is a 150 million blockbuster about nothing. A lighter funnier effort than the previous installments ""Star Trek Beyond"" reflects a changing of the guard. With JJ Abrams passing the baton to Justin Lin the latest entry plays like a CGI-heavy ""Fast and the Furious"" movie set in the future with fancy gadgetry and fast-paced showdowns taking prominence over plot. Simon Pegg does double-duty returning to the role of Scotty and co-writing the screenplay with Doug Jung. The result has Lins eye for outstanding set pieces and Peggs ear for injecting familiar genre tropes with wit. Theres an odd disconnect between the movies undercooked conflict and its epic scale to the point where it barely exists as more than a series of flashy moments. But its trivial qualities come as something of a relief -- this is a movie engineered to avoid overextending its allure which differs greatly from so many of its summer movie peers that do exactly that. The overall inconsequential nature of ""Star Trek Beyond"" stands in stark contrast to 2013s sprawling ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" in which rising Starfleet leader Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) at one point loses his job and at another briefly loses his life. At the beginning of ""Star Trek Beyond"" hes faced with a more immediate issue Boredom. Three years into a planned five-year mission to explore the cosmos the Captain explains in his starlog intro that boldly going where no man has gone before can get awfully redundant sometimes. Lins camera glides beautifully through the Starship Enterprise capturing the various familiar members of the crew -- Spock (Zachary Quinto) Uhura (Zoe Saldana) Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) Sulu (John Cho) Scotty and Chekhov (the late Anton Yelchin sadly given little to do in a thankless role). Theyre all still there pressing buttons sharing drinks beaming about on unspecified missions. ""What is it were trying to accomplish?"" Kirk wonders and the answer just dangles there. But then just enough happens to generate the semblance of high stakes A mysterious alien object stored in the ships hull generates the interest of the villainous Krall (Idris Elba under layers of makeup that suggest Klingon by way of triceratops) a criminal leader of unknown origins who invades the ship and uses his mechanical space army to take down the starship. The ensuing crash sequence drags on for minutes on end unfolding as a breathless series of daring maneuvers flying bodies and flaming debris that for a brief moment suggest real peril for everyone involved. Unfortunately once the Enterprise stops moving the movie grinds to a halt as well. Lin grounds the crew on a boring planet alongside a lame bad guy. Kralls eerie ability to sap energy from his prisoners receives just one tossed-off scene and the reasons behind his evil intentions receive only a pithy explanation in the final act. Much of the movie finds various members of the Starship roaming the planet trying to figure out ideas for escaping it. This kind of scenario often sustained single episodes of the original show but struggles to congeal as a single 142 minute package. Per usual some interactions generate more sparks than others. At first alone in the woods Scotty comes across fierce survivalist Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) a pale-faced warrior apparently inspired by Jennifer Laurences individualistic teen in ""Winters Bone."" Jaylahs not the most original ass-kicker around but her ability to manipulate invisibility fields and bound about the woodsy terrain with ease provides the movie with a nice burst of attitude. Karl Urban and Zachary Quinto in ""Star Trek Beyond""Paramount Pictures The rest of the cast just toys around making it clear just how much these movies are driven by personalities. Much has been made in news reports about the decision to turn Sulu gay a revelation that fills approximately three seconds of screen time. Thats as it should. Even as the last two films emphasized Kirks challenges with his fathers legacy in the captains chair the core ""Star Trek"" cast have very little in the way of backstories. Theyre defined by their exchanges with each other Forget about Spocks complicated backstory as a member of the Vulcan race; the stone-faced characters big challenge in ""Star Trek Beyond"" is his relationship troubles with Uhura and when he winds up stranded on the planet alongside the surly Dr. McCoy the doctor takes on new duties as a shrink. When theyre done feuding and teasing each other the movie turns back to its bare-bones plot. Eventually the survivors gather at a ramshackle base to plot a means of overtaking the Starship from the bad guys yielding another set piece -- this one based around motorcycles and jump cables -- before Kirk finds an excuse to blast ""Sabotage"" for a breezy sequence that plays like a 3D ""Space Invaders."" Toss in a few more vibrant alien species and geeky one-liners (""Theres no relative direction in space you have only yourself"") and voila While ""Star Trek Beyond"" lacks a center it compensates with an endless parade of distractions. When the movie moves along at a breezy clip its partly because it feels so purposeless. The central threat revolves around the most explicit MacGuffin in recent memory (a box that contains some enigmatic thing of unknown destructive potential that many different people want to get their hands on) and yet thats enough to let the strengths stand out particularly the stunning effects work. The massive space port Yorktown is a swirling helix of human activity while the Enterprise itself speeds through hyperspace in shiny closeups that would have been unthinkable just a few years back. As a franchise that celebrates technological progress its only appropriate that the ""Star Trek"" movies have become a shining example of just that. Nevertheless this playful meandering saga ultimately arrives at a bland third act finale featuring the so-called ""Climbing Killer Syndrome"" in which the antagonist must irrationally flee to an inescapable high elevation while explaining his entire motive. Toss in a tenuous connection to some earlier ""Star Trek"" entries to keep the series street cred in check and everybody gets to go home happy. Nothing about this polished movie suggests the slightest attempt to reinvent the wheel. If ""Star Trek Beyond"" existed outside the arena of reboots and sequels that mandated its existence the movies casual air might be downright radical for such an extensive production. Instead its just a sturdy riff on the same old routine. Grade B- ""Star Trek Beyond"" opens nationwide on July 21.

Reply Chad July 20 2016 957 pm There is no ""important reason"" to justify making a previously heterosexual character gay. They could just as easily introduced a new character who was gay rather than take an iconic character known to be straight amp; with a natural family instead of this in your face middle finger. This is just more Progressive LGBT agenda driven bullcrap amp; we all know it. When theyre not targeting faith based businesses like Nazis hunting Jews theyre shoving their warped lifestyle down our throats on TV amp; in the movies. That said Star Trek is set 300 years in the future where advancements in medical science have discovered cures for a host of genetic aberrations. Since gays always like to cite genetics as the cause for their homosexuality Im sure that in the future (for the sake of procreation of the species in an age of space exploration) simple gene manipulation will have found a way to eradicate the ""gay gene"" thus curing that particular aberration.

Your kind is dying and not a moment too soon. the movie rating that reads ""dont go see this pointless pos but I still want the advertising revenue"". Reply Nan July 22 2016 1136 am Chad. I agree with you 100%. And the response that you received just proved it. You were right not to respond. We are not dyingwe are multiplying Reply TimmyD July 23 2016 1048 am I thought the movie was great My 9 yo son loved it Plenty of action decent story line and the way they segue the passing of Nimoy with the passing of the original Spock; nicely done. Concerning Sulus minor background thang...the actor let it out o the bag before the movie came out. When they showed the scene of Sulu with his daughter and partner it was pretty much received (by me at least) as ""Oh yeah...whatever...get back to the action"" Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The previous Star Trek movie 2013s Into Darkness was packed with it a sprawling epic full of new worlds violent consequences and hefty emotional moments. It was later - just a little unfairly - voted the worst Trek movie ever by some of the seriess most hardcore fans. So its a genuine pleasure to report that Star Trek Beyond is not ambitious in the slightest - unless you count the filmmakers absolute commitment to making audiences grin whoop and bounce up and down in their seats. More than any franchise entry since 1998s (admittedly ropey) Star Trek Insurrection it feels like a classic TV episode the crew of the Enterprise head to a mysterious planet they get into a spot of bother and Captain Kirk punches an alien. The end. Of course theres a tad more to it than that as the Enterprises investigation into a mysterious shipwreck leads to a spectacular confrontation with a swarm of drones and leaves the crew marooned and scattered on a rocky treacherous world. This time around its Kirk (Chris Pine) and Scott (Simon Pegg) who do most of the heroic heavy lifting - co-writer Pegg has noticeaby beefed up his own role - while Spock (Zachary Quinto) keeps it suitably cerebral wrapped up in fears for the future of his race and grief at the death of his older self. A tribute to the late Leonard Nimoy is genuinely moving - though theres only a post-film dedication to Anton Yelchin aka Chekov whose tragic death was too recent. But the dominant mood is giddy and jubilant not since the original crew stepped down have we felt such a vivid sense of adventure and comradeship. And it helps that Fast amp; Furious veteran Justin Lin is a better straight-up action director than JJ Abrams ever was the battle scenes roar like thunder and a late sequence in a gravity-defying starbase is astonishing. The films Achilles heel - again - is its villain Idris Elba gives it his all as lizard-faced psycho Krall but deep down hes just another muscly warrior with an irrational grudge. Still that - and a handful of dicey plot holes - aside this is all fun all the time a dizzying carnival of wisecracks fisticuffs explosions chases and truly eye-popping effects.

However my husband said he wanted to go and it was on at a better time than the BFG so I begrudgingly said Id go.  Id also read that Simon Pegg had written it which made be a bit more inclined to want to see it.It started off as youd expect - the newer versions of the main characters finding themselves in some perilous situation and working together to find a way around it.  Im not that into Sci Fi and I was thinking it was a bit samey samey.  However as the story unfolded I got more into it and found myself enjoying it - it felt a bit like a cross between Star Wars and Mad Max. I had heard that Idris Elba was in it but didnt realise which character he was until towards the endThis was a good film which is worth seeing even if you are not a sci fi fan. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore1 day agoNatalieOTastemakerFeaturedIve seen the other recent films in the series never seen any of the older ones But I do find these films worth a watch and I knew I had to watch it when irdis Elba was in the film What you expect from a fantasy action filmHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore2 days agoSarah GTastemakerFeaturedLets be clear at the start - I am a trekkie. I watched Star Trek the original as a little girl and grew up with The Next Generation DS9 and Voyager were great loves though perhaps not as diligently watched and I have seen ALL the films. I love the philosophy the characters the space geekiness and the fun. So a Star Trek film would have to be awful for me to say anything bad -but Beyond is great. Its a bit slow to start and i found the pervading darkness in the first section a bit trying - I actually checked I wasnt wearing my sunglasses But the film builds with energy tech geekiness and true federation spirt - the effects are great the homage to the original programmes and the tribute to Leonard Nimoy had me in tears. I particularly loved the last touch of all the characters voicing the traditional - mission - to boldly go message they have made the ending motif of the new films.Its hard for me to look at it and think what it would be like for someone unfamilar with the traditions to watch it so I wont bother - if you like sci fi then give it a go. And lets not forget IDRIS ELBA is in it - playing a great twisted evil baddie - superbHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore3 days agoLee hFeaturedSorry I found it cheesy in comparison to the first 2 films. From bad hair dues to ugly uniforms and weird warp trails and bubbles lol. I think they drifted to far away from the first two movies which I liked very much and still watch now. Much was lost without J J Abrams at the helm. I will however give it 3 stars for effort but 2.5 would better reflect my thoughts. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore4 days agonicknicknTastemakerFeaturedStar Trek Beyond is a mixture of good and not so good.Lets get the worst out of the way first - the film is too long for the very flimsy story 20 minutes could be cut all of it from the battle near the start of the movie which was predictable and repetitive. There are huge holes in the plot which are explained away by ridiculous technical gobbledygook although some of this is done in a knowing tongue-in-cheek way which at least makes it funny.Humour is one of the good points of the film it doesnt take itself too seriously and it is the funniest of the franchise so far. The script is excellent there are some really good lines and the resolution of the film is both clever and witty. The special effects and the acting are good. I really liked Sofia Boutellas character.We are now on the third film into the reboot series and we already know all the main crew members. This film develops and handles the relationships between these characters very well and we really do care about them by the end of this movie. It is genuinely sad to think that Anton Yeltsin wont be there if there is another in the franchise.Even though this is not one of the best Star Trek films in terms of plot or storyline; it is one of the best for humour and character development and I will certainly be coming back to see what happens to them in the next instalment.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore5 days agocharlotte_sometimestastemakerFeaturedDoes it go beyond expectations..?I was very lucky to be invited to attend a screening of Star Trek Beyond at Picturehouse Central on Thursday. Of the three films so far in this franchise this easily has to be my favourite. It has an incredibly well-balanced amount of fun and serious action and comedy light and darkness.Its an entertaining adventure which fully engages  for the majority of the films  122 minutes running time. It may not push itself in terms of plot or as seems to be the case with many of this 2016s blockbuster releases go as far as it could/should its more than successful at doing what it sets out to do. It wants to amuse and entertain both of which it does. With spades.The plot itself is fine its not groundbreaking or brand new but it does the job in allowing the characters to shine. Many elements are cliche-ridden and some of the MacGuffins are drowned in far too much pseudo-science. And yet this is not problematic as the characters still shine. Having gone into the film with zero expectations Star Trek Beyond did not disappoint at all and was a genuine pleasure to watch.  I was gripped for the first third - frightened for the well-being of characters Id truly grown to care for - entertained for the second third and gripped once more for the final third. I laughed a lot and held my breath for the dramatic sections.
