Report Chandler Parsons  Next The Not Quite Midseason Awards Courtesy of Warner Bros Facebook Twitter Print Die Hard Die Die Die Die Die Yeah so the new John McClane joint aint so hot. Plus The rest of the week in movies. by Wesley Morris on February 15 2013 Should an action movie care? Should it care to do more than send a state-of-the-art helicopter sinking out of the sky because theres an armored truck dangling chained from its cargo bay? Should it care that as inventive a stunt as that weighed-down chopper might be it is alas only a stunt in a film littered with similar stunts? Should it care that an audience might need more than cars that fly off one level of a Russian highway only to cause mayhem when they land on the road below that we might need actual screenwriting to give some sense and structure to all that chaos? A Good Day to Die Hard is an action movie and it definitely doesnt care. This is the fifth and least of the Die Hard movies. Its most loving imagery all involves people and vehicles falling to the ground. One of those falling people finds the mental clarity to thrust up his middle finger on his way down. Thats supposed to be a rousing moment of triumph but its just a depressing show of contempt -- for the audience for the genre and the series. The movie never earns the right to be so cavalier. The bird-flipper is Bruce Williss John McClane the NYPD detective who became an iconic movie hero in the first three Die Hard movies outsmarting and outliving terrorists and a cartoon by the fourth. Its not simply his indestructibility that now makes him less than real (his die-hardness has never been up for debate). But for at least the first three movies the excitement came from both McClanes vulnerability and epic lucklessness (he was once allegedly just a cop). Bad news and worse people -- Europeans all -- refused to stop intruding on his already dysfunctional life. In these last two terribly titled movies (2007s Live Free or Die Hard stunk up screens a dozen years after the urban fun and racial daring of Die Hard With a Vengeance which actually began life as a Brandon Lee thriller called Simon Says) McClane has gone completely bald and turned into a kind of disaster junkie. Hes as turned on by mass destruction as the nutjobs we expect him to vanquish. Originally Willis was something new for the action movie which had been defined by old-guard right-wingers and muscly monosyllabic ethnics. He was this little blue-collar smart-ass with a receding hairline. What he lacked in physicality he made up for in attitude. When the first Die Hard arrived in the late summer of 1988 Willis was known as the guy bantering with Cybill Shepherd on ABCs Moonlighting. His charm came from his seeming both mildly drunk and slightly hungover. He was louche and sleazy and cocky but not secure enough to believe that he was more charismatic than she was. That of course made him kind of sexy He wanted her approval and by extension ours. Putting Willis at the scene of a hostage situation where one of the hostages was McClanes wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) with the scene being a Los Angeles skyscraper gave his macho street intelligence potentially a real challenge Could he take out an entire gang of Germanic evil? The excitement of Willis in these first three movies was how he kept surprising himself. He seemed to have no idea what he was doing until he was doing it. But the directors -- John McTiernan for the first and third; Renny Harlin for the outrageous second -- understood how to take a formula thriller and proceed as though the world had never seen a heist movie. They had clever-enough scripts that bumped up the scale -- terrorists in our buildings our airports our subways -- without sacrificing our ability to relate to the stakes or navigate the action. Will McClane save Holly? Will he save New York? Its hard to appreciate but Die Hard was such a mold-breaking hit that it made most action movies strive almost parodically for its formula. Speed was Die Hard on a bus. Cliffhanger was Die Hard on a mountain. Virtuosity was Die Hard in cyberspace. Setting aside mild-mannered suspense dramas like 1974s The Taking of Pelham One Two Three Die Hard was the action-movie Big Bang. Whats remarkable about all three movies is their attention to pacing and setup. In the first film theres so much going on in and around the Nakatomi building that creates tension and suspense for McTiernan to exploit. Each establishes precisely the terms of the various conflicts so that once the action gets under way its inextricable from the drama thats driving it. The chases and murders and explosions are part of the narrative. This is also known as storytelling and its virtually extinct in the action movies current iteration. By 2007 the action movie was thinking more globally. The North American box office was no longer enough. These movies werent content with saving Manhattan. They had to save the world mostly by hopping from one time-stamped locale to the next. But to work on that scale a movie needs a prevailing scope a sense not only that the planet is big but an idea of how the heroes fit within all that borderlessness. Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol is a wonderful example of how an internationalist franchise had found a way to work globally yet with some humor and intimacy. A Good Day to Die Hard is set in Moscow but has a plot that changes its mind. A political prisoner plot becomes an international intrigue plot which becomes an epic terrorism plot. With each narrative costume change the location becomes increasingly beside the point. Never mind that most of the later action involves Chernobyl a specific notorious Russian location thats treated with little reverence for the atrocity thats left it such a barren wasteland. How the movie gets here isnt important Basically McClanes estranged adult son Jack (Jai Courtney) is a spy shepherding a Russian oppositionist (Sebastian Koch) first to retrieve an important file and then to his sexy daughter and then to safety. McClane heads to Moscow to see Jack and winds up a gleeful participant in highway demolition derbies and elaborate shootouts. But the movie is determined to force the drama of this story into some kind of father-son reconciliation. John turns goopy with resentment. Jacks eyes begin to well up with the tears of a son who misses the father he spends an hour saying he hates. Of all the illogic on display in this movie (is neutralizing radiation as possible as it is here?) the sentiment curdling between these two is the most galling -- mainly since its the least of the reasons weve come. None of it seems to bother Willis though. He looks happy to be in a movie he can dominate with his smirk. Despite McClanes no longer being a smoker Willis does things with his face that make it appear as though hes taking long satisfying drags on an unseen cigarette. But hes much better than this sort of payday exercise. Did he not see himself in Looper or Moonrise Kingdom? He doesnt have much else to do here beyond shoot and smirk. Covered in blood and broken glass he seems superfluous. The movie is more a showcase for the stunt team and the effects department and their work especially during all the slow-motion absurdity of the finale is often stunning. Its cheap dissatisfying and sad -- a blockbuster with Die Hard flavoring. For what its worth the director is John Moore working from a rickety script by Skip Woods. Moore is competent but he might as well be designing one of the video games thats spun off from this franchise. There are all of the mechanics and rote villainy (one of the Eurobaddies chomps on a carrot and declares his contempt for America) but no higher (or even lower) purpose to speak of. We get all the seriess destruction with none of the plot character actors suspense coherence or tank tops of the first three movies. Its cheap dissatisfying and sad -- a blockbuster with Die Hard flavoring. This fifth installment actually embodies what Sylvester Stallones two Expendables films should have obviated -- action stars of yesterday fighting their obsolescence by going back to basics. But that of course was the problem with those movies Stallone wasnt sending up old action films; he was trying to revive dead or dying careers. Last month brought Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Last Stand and Stallone in Bullet to the Head and nobody cared. Willis at least is simply leaning on something familiar. Still you cant blame any of them. Theyve surveyed the landscape of action-star alternatives and seen no one younger who threatens them. Take this Jai Courtney. Hes a young physically fit Australian whos uncomfortably Tom Hardy-like (its the eyes lips and vaguely disguised non-American accent). But hes not anything else. I dont know that he could carry a franchise on his own. Almost no ones expected to now. The effects departments are the new stars. And the flesh-and-blood men who could carry an action movie -- the Hugh Jackmans Channing Tatums and Dwayne Johnsons -- are too good at other stuff to purely Stallone themselves. The version of the action movie that Willis and his ilk helped popularize is on its last legs. A jalopy like A Good Day to Die Hard merely italicizes its demise. Ladies its Valentines weekend. And some of you might want to spend part of it at the movies. Hollywood thinks its got two winners for you each based on a popular book and set in the South. The first is Safe Haven which began as a Nicholas Sparks novel and depending on how you take your romantic dramas is either the equivalent of a warm bath or a sink full of dishes. Sparks has cornered the market on love in sleepy seaside towns. The grubby tragedy of his first books (The Notebook A Walk to Remember) has morphed into the kind of New Age nonsense that when faithfully produced on screen can cause you to spit out your Pepsi. The glorious badness of Safe Haven comes from the way the veteran director Lasse Hallstrom applies the greeting-card tastefulness hes used for Whats Eating Gilbert Grape Something to Talk About The Cider House Rules Chocolat Dear John and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen to a movie whose punch line is so delightfully absurd that even after you pretty much know whats coming you spit out your Pepsi anyway. Julianne Hough plays a young woman who desperately flees Boston by bus hops off in Southport North Carolina and gives herself a new name (Katie) and haircut (Mary Stuart Masterson). She rents a great house gets a job at the local seafood shack makes pals with another single lady (a lifeless-looking Cobie Smulders) and falls for the hunky widower (Josh Duhamel) who runs The Only Store in Town. His name is Alex and he cant seem to understand why it takes so long for his hotness and the cuteness of his two kids to occur to her. But we know why. We have flashbacks. ""Katie"" is running from an abusive drunk (David Lyons) who we see in separate scenes harassing people for Katies whereabouts. You think you know where this is headed -- and youre mostly right. The abuser gets to Southport in time for the Fourth of July But theres more. This is the sort of movie (based on the sort of book) in which Alexs late wife took the time to write a letter to her children which theyre to open in their teenage years. Its the sort of movie in which she also bothered to pen one for ""the woman my husband loves"" or something like that. Theyve been written on paper that doesnt appear to burn in a house fire. And when Katie opens hers youll feel bad that you had to spit soda all over it. But theres no other choice What the letter implies is ridiculous. What the story pulls back to reveal at that moment -- and no I wont spoil it though you can probably guess -- is even more so. What the movie thinks is a loving piety is really just celestial dreariness saved up for a big plot twist. I dont know whod want to spend Valentines weekend this way with the Keyser Soze of seaside romance. Of course that would be vastly preferable to the other movie that opened on February 14. Its something called Beautiful Creatures in which a teenage Southerner falls for a girl who turns out to be a witch except because Beautiful Creatures is based on a series of young adult novels you cant call her a witch. You have to call her a ""Caster."" The boy Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) cant take things too far with the girl Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) because she wont quite let him. Lena lives with her extended family in a mansion that looks like the gothic version of the surrealist house in Beetlejuice. She hails from a line of powerful Casters and upon her 16th birthday shell be ready for The Reaping some kind of transformational rite in which her soul her fate or possibly her hair color will forever be ""dark or light."" And because the entire point of movies based on young adult fiction appears to be that nothing can be called what it is no one ever surmises that really all the Reaping seems to be is either a garden party for your period or a very public acknowledgment that you might have a mental illness. (It might also be both.) Beautiful Creatures is like the Twilight movies but with a chaperone making sure the boys dance a foot apart from the girls. (Twilight allows for heavy petting and then intercourse.) Its loosely like The Hunger Games but with nothing thoughtful to say about violence or popular culture or making something of yourself. The film feels very much the result of many people -- the novelists Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl; the writer and director Richard LaGravenese; the assortment of producers; and Warner Bros. -- taking stock of the young adult landscape and saying ""We can do that."" I would beg to differ. Very few movies based on so-called YA fiction is very good. The last two Twilight movies are difficult to watch in part because the filmmaking drags one minute and is on cocaine the next. But you at least believed that this hot girl wanted to do it so much with this one undead guy that shed risk her life. Its a stupid confused way to look at sex but at least it felt that way with a modicum of conviction. I dont know how Beautiful Creatures feels about anything. Theres no central drama or suspense. Theres no sexual tension or eroticism or real comedy (although the night I saw it the girls in the audience seemed to find Ehrenreich appealing). Theres some overwrought business involving Civil War reenactments and the alarming image of scars on Viola Daviss back which evokes a slave masters lash. But theyre glossed over in a way thats shocking coming from a man who helped turn Toni Morrisons Beloved into a movie. Its more stuff youre not allowed to call by its name. None of the actors at the center of the movie inspires anything close to enthusiasm. And there isnt one beautiful image in the whole film. The effects actually have a sludgy muddy quality so when Lena and her estranged Little Red Corvette of a sister (Emmy Rossum) have a shouting match that makes the dinner table rise up off the floor and spin around its like watching a pottery wheel lose its mind. The bright frilly costumes and makeup give naturalist actors like Eileen Atkins and Margo Martindale a creepiness they shouldnt have. (You havent felt truly sorry for an actor until youve seen Martindale in a big cottony wig. She looks like dessert.) Jeremy Irons appears to be enjoying himself as Lenas hammy uncle. Davis makes the most of whats basically another caretaker (her characters name is Amma which practically begs for rearrangement at the Soul Train Scramble Board) and Emma Thompson as Lenas evil mother attempts to tear the roof off the movie. Its unclear what shes going for but whatever it is its unserious which ought to win her something. Beautiful Creatures is what would happen if Tim Burton tried to film a William Faulkner novel as though it were Sabrina the Teenage Witch. (That makes either Irons or Davis the talking cat.) These movies -- and the so-called YA novels that inspire them -- wind up taking real adolescent experiences (losing your virginitys a big one) and larding it with all kinds of fantastical danger that perverts the actual meaning of that experience. The directness and piquancy in the music of Alanis Morissette Liz Phair PJ Harvey and Tori Amos have retarded into euphemisms for lust. The piss and vinegar of the 1990s have dried up. A decade later girls hormonal-emotional surrogates in books and movies arent getting mad even or straightforwardly laid. Theyre getting reaped.

(Photo/Video Sony Pictures Classics) By Joe Morgenstern Updated Feb. 14 2013 637 p.m. ET How often does a new movie go out of its way to look dated? Maybe as often as the word no takes on positive meaning. Both cases apply to Pablo Larrains ""No"" an exceptionally smart political drama with a satirical edge about the 1988 referendum that drove the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet out of office. In the run-up to the vote the No campaign--a coalition of Pinochets opponents--chose a rainbow logo for its signature and delivered its media message with exuberantly upbeat television spots. Saying no to another term for Pinochet who had been in power for 15 years was equated with saying yes to a democratic future. Against massive odds the nays carried the day and Pinochet was sent packing. To portray that turning point in Chiles history Mr. Larrain and his cinematographer Sergio Armstrong found long-obsolete video cameras of the period and pressed them into service. The results will seem a bit blurry to contemporary eyes but usefully so. Everything on screen--new sequences involving the star Gael Garcia Bernal; old TV footage including the feel-good spots; restaged events and ingenious recreations of archival material--blends together into a past thats eerily present. In the process factuality has also been blurred ""No"" an Oscar contender in subtitled Spanish should be seen as fiction grounded in historical events. But that doesnt diminish its value. Like ""Argo"" or ""Zero Dark Thirty"" the film dramatizes a fertile subject--in this instance the language of advertising in modern politics. Mr. Bernal is Rene Saavedra a Santiago advertising executive whos too old to be called a whiz kid though still young enough to navigate the citys streets on a skateboard. As the movie opens hes about to hit the start button for a demo that he knows will be troubling for the client so he offers an earnest assurance that his presentation ""is in line with the current social context"" and an assertion that Chiles citizens ""have raised their demands in regard to truth in regard to what they like."" The product in question is Free a soda pop celebrated in the commercial with images of gleeful guzzlers that include dancers and rockers plus a blissed-out mime. The elaborate presentation of the frivolous package is enjoyable in itself but the sequence also serves as a perfect setup for a serious payoff since the commercials aesthetic differs little from the ads that Rene soon creates with the same assurance of social relevance for the No side of the referendum. (To clarify the historical context this is four years after Ronald Reagans legendarily effective ""Its morning again in America"" campaign ad.) Even the mime reappears bespeaking wordless optimism while the film speaks to the power--and danger--of packaging democracy like any other product. Mr. Larrain has previously illuminated his nations politics albeit by reflected light--in ""Post Mortem"" which centers on a solitary morgue worker swept up in the U.S.-supported military coup of 1973; and in "" Tony Manero"" which sets its story of a serial killer against the background of Pinochets reign of terror. This time in a film that deals directly with the dictatorship he has taken significant liberties with the No campaign which succeeded by virtue of elaborate grass-roots organization--no mention of that--as well as iconoclastic TV spots. Still ""No"" signals a huge spurt in the filmmakers growth. The appeal of the David-and-Goliath plot is intensified by solid dramatic carpentry and by the fluent back-and-forth between live and archive--in the heat of street battles and mass demonstrations you cant tell if youre watching simulations or the real heart-pounding thing. And the intrinsic wit of the script which Pedro Peirano adapted from a play by Antonio Skarmeta is heightened by deft direction and by Mr. Bernals droll performance. Rene can be as entranced by a microwave oven--another new product his agency is pushing--as he is by taking on a supposedly unbeatable political adversary. Yet hes not the political naif he may have seemed to be before his radicalization (which happens awfully quickly and glibly). The ad man understands all too well that many of the No campaigns disheartened leftists dont share his goal of victory; for them success simply means a chance to air grievances and another honorable loss. Its great fun to see the evolution of the TV spots peddling as they do the proposition that democracy should be fun. First comes the iconic rainbow then a jingle (which shouldnt sound like ""We Are the World"" Rene cautions at the recording session) then singing and dancing manifestations of future jubilance in the body politic. Its all so enjoyable that one risks missing the paradox--that this highly symbolic language as indispensable to the process of marketing politicians as to selling consumer goods is equally the syntax of manipulation and propaganda the sine qua non of those 30-second commercials that have debased political discourse around the world. ""No"" takes note of the paradox in a satirical coda. Rene back at work in the wake of the referendum victory has devised a campaign for a soap opera called ""Beautiful and Bold."" Not only is it framed ""within the actual social context"" as he once again assures his new clients the campaign is built around a bogus event with irresistible appeal for TV news. This time the goal will be Yes by acclamation. Watch a clip from the film ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Russia to help out his son Jack only to discover that he is a CIA operative working to prevent a nuclear-weapons heist. (Photo/Video 20th Century Fox) A Good Day to Die Hard For anyone who remembers the ""Die Hard"" adventures at their vital and exciting best this film feels like a near-death experience. ENLARGE Bruce Willis Twentieth Century Fox Bruce Willis is back as John McClane once an intrepid police detective but now a busybody parody of his younger self. In the travesty that passes for a plot McClane goes to Moscow to find his estranged son Jack ( Jai Courtney) who is actually which is to say absurdly a CIA operative assigned to protect Sebastian Kochs Russian whistleblower who in turn...but all of this is on a need-to-know basis and all you need to know is that the car chases are visual gibberish most of the 97-minute running time is devoted to people shooting at one another the magazines on their assault weapons contain thousands of rounds Mr. Courtneys charms range from undetectable to nil and the movie directed by John Moore plays on the theme of father-and-son reconciliation with the finesse of a primate taught to play ""Chopsticks."" On the other hand the production must have provided significant employment in Budapest whose streets double for Moscows and Skip Woodss thumpingly hollow screenplay brings news that the Chernobyl meltdown wasnt caused by Soviet incompetence as the world has chosen to believe but by some oligarchs scheme to steal plutonium. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is the meltdown of a once-formidable franchise. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""Beautiful Creatures."" Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) and Lena (Alice Englert) uncover dark secrets about their respective families their history and their town. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) Beautiful Creatures Early in their relationship Lena and Ethan the anguished lovers of this supernatural romance have a chat about Charles Bukowski. Lena has been reading his books and Ethan asks if Bukowski is any good. ""Define good"" she replies. After a darned good beginning the movie defines bad. ENLARGE Jeremy Irons Warner Bros. Pictures ""Beautiful Creatures"" was directed by Richard LaGravenese from his adaptation of the first in the series of young-adult novels by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl. The setting is small-town South Carolina where 17-year-old Ethan ( Alden Ehrenreich) dreams of escape but also of an unattainable young beauty who awaits him in a recurring dream on a Civil War battlefield. Lena ( Alice Englert) who strongly resembles that beauty shows up in town to live with her reclusive cousin Macon ( Jeremy Irons oozing doom) and is immediately suspected of being a witch. This suspicion is off the mark but shes still big trouble for Ethan because she is not strictly speaking--or even loosely speaking--human. What a peculiar production this is. Up to a certain point it really does promise to be romantic. Listening to Lena confess that she has troubling powers Ethan is all ears eyes and heart. ""Youre a miracle"" he says ardently. ""Why would you ever want to be normal?"" And the more she tells him of her plight--of The Claiming that will determine at the moment she turns 16 whether her bright or dark side will prevail--the more ardent he becomes. But there is not in fact a lot of feeling between the young actors. And when that certain point comes--when Emma Thompsons arch-conservative Mrs. Lincoln undergoes a sudden change in her character--the movie is claimed just as suddenly by narrative incoherence Tim Burton-envy and the usual demons of digital effects. --J.M. ENLARGE The Loneliest Planet DVD Focus The Loneliest Planet (2011) Gael Garcia Bernal and Hani Furstenberg are Alex and Nica backpacking through the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia prior to getting married in Julia Loktevs spectacularly scenic and tersely dramatic feature. Just as the film compels us to observe Georgias geography it asks us to study its young couples behavior. Until the midpoint theyre as loving and trusting as a couple can be. Then something happens a small but decisive event that transforms the relationship in the blink of an eye and its suddenly clear that the loneliness of the movies title refers not to landscapes but to souls. ENLARGE Unstrung Heroes Buena Vista Pictures/Everett Collection Unstrung Heroes (1995) Richard LaGravenese adapted this beautiful coming-of-age comedy from the splendid memoir of the same name by Franz Lidz. Directed with subtlety and spirit by Diane Keaton the film is little known by now and wasnt much better known when it first came out. Nathan Watt is Steven a 12-year-old with a sick mother (Andie MacDowell) and a remote father ( John Turturro) who runs off to live with his eccentric uncles. Theyre played con gusto and brio by Michael Richards and Maury Chaykin. Phedon Papamichael did the luminous cinematography. Thomas Newman was nominated for an Oscar for his distinctive score. ENLARGE The Lives of Others The Lives of Others (2006) Sebastian Koch is Georg Dreyman the celebrated playwright in Florian Henckel von Donnersmarcks superlative debut feature. The story is set in East Berlin five years before the fall of the Wall when the Stasi or secret police put Dreyman under intense surveillance. The playwright is suspected of nothing in particular but a cultural commissar has his own reasons for targeting him and his actress girlfriend Christa ( Martina Gedeck). In a classic conflict between totalitarianism and art the presiding snoop and up to a point true believer is played by Ulrich Muhe. An Oscar-winner as best foreign film. --J.M. 24 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Jason Bourne Whats Happened So Far?

Pictures Calling Beautiful Creatures a Southern-fried Twilight wouldnt be an unfair claim at least based on its marketing campaign -- which highlights that yes this movie centers on a teen romance between a couple of star-crossed kids one of whom yes is all kinds of supernatural. And yes their love puts the fate of the world in danger because well why not? Based on a series of young-adult novels by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl Creatures is a flawed tonally mercurial movie that struggles to translate its source material into a cohesive film. But without scenes consisting only of characters staring into each others eyes it immediately has more depth to offer than its pop-culture cousin. What its trailer doesnt begin to capture is that this surprisingly beguiling attempt to blend fantasy coming-of-age drama melodrama camp and social critique isnt always successful -- but its nearly always entertaining. Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich) is a bright charismatic high school junior quickly growing tired of his small Bible Belt town the fictional Gatlin S.C. While dreaming daily of going to college far away (and nightly of a mysterious raven-haired girl) he tears into Naked Lunch The Catcher in the Rye and every other banned book he can get his hands on. He finds delight in his disdain for his classmates who seem to be content to live and die in stifling Gatlin a fate that recently befell Ethans mother. Enter Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) an abrasive outsider a far cry from the chatty Southern belles in Ethans classroom; when those gossip girls say that Lena is a Ravenwood -- a member of the wealthy reclusive clan that founded the town -- Ethans interest is piqued. And before you can say ""meet cute"" Ethan is following her around earnestly trying to befriend her. Hes like a puppy trying to melt the heart of a cactus. Yet somewhere around the time she recommends Bukowski to him -- he becomes an inarticulate bumble when he tries to quote it back to her -- something curious happens A movie that looks like a by-the-numbers teen romance (with so far only suggested by-the-numbers fantasy elements) this thing that would seem right at home playing next to The Vampire Diaries on The CW becomes something else actually romantic. Ehrenreich and Englert bring a natural extremely ingratiating chemistry to their scenes a vibe thats only enhanced by writer-director Richard LaGraveneses dialogue -- a restrained mix of playful self-aware banter and real nervousness about approaching a state as defenseless as love. Lena whos just lost her father turns out to be a perfect foil for Ethan Shes of the exciting outside world he wants to know and she would give anything to fit into a place as easily as he does. Their relationships grand supernatural sticking point -- because of course theres one -- is that Lenas family is ""different."" i Jeremy Irons has fun with a Southern accent as patriarch Macon Ravenwood in Beautiful Creatures even if he seems to be in a different film than the young lovers. John Bramley/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption John Bramley/Warner Bros. Pictures Jeremy Irons has fun with a Southern accent as patriarch Macon Ravenwood in Beautiful Creatures even if he seems to be in a different film than the young lovers. John Bramley/Warner Bros. Pictures ""So like youre from Europe?"" asks Ethan. Despite his talent for spouting disarming bits of folksiness the fact that hes a mere mortal is a non-starter for ""casters"" (magic users) like Lena and her cane-wielding cravat-wearing uncle Macon (Jeremy Irons) who vows to keep the two apart. The true problem is that when Lena turns 16 (a long hundred-plus days away) shes scheduled to be claimed by either the light or the dark side of magic -- a fairly arbitrary event and something that only female casters have to deal with for some unspecified reason. The fate of the world is also involved of course since Lenas mother Sarafine is a powerful dark caster and her forces are marshaling against Macons. This all leads to some truly satisfying scene-chewery from Irons as Macon forbids Lena to see that boy again (and again) even if there are only so many times a variation on that scene can play out before Irons delicious Southern accent starts to wear. Emma Thompson too gets in on the act of overacting with relish as the towns most conservative churchgoer; the malevolent Sarafine possesses her and she and Macon have it out good in a not-so-subtle scene in one of the towns churches. Tone in Beautiful Creatures is a strange thing to keep track of; see above as regards camp teen melodrama and social critique. While Ehrenreich and Englert fall in love in one movie and Irons and Thompson magically and verbally spar in another Emmy Rossum and Viola Davis occupy individual universes of their own. Rossum as Lenas seductive cousin already claimed for the dark isnt so much chewing scenery as alternately screaming at or making out with it while Davis balances the camp as a friend of Ethans mother the only person truly still looking out for him. Buffy the Vampire Slayer might be an apt comparison given its appetite for banter pop-culture references and the supernatural as metaphor for various coming-of-age struggles but unlike that cult favorite Creatures cant quite manage to tame its disparate parts into a single experience. The resulting mishmash is a lot like Ethan himself -- full of aspirations good intentions and eagerness to charm its way into your heart even as it trips over itself. Creatures bogs down when it yet again rewrites its sometimes confusing mythology and when its plot meanders waiting around for the days to count down to Lenas claiming -- its less ticking clock than sleepy swamp-gator lumbering -- but the movie is at least savvy enough to circle back regularly to Ethan and Lena. The scenes where its just the two of them talking and connecting as real people glimmer with a magic all their own.

Into the fray rushes ""Beautiful Creatures"" based on the Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl bestseller and starring a lot of A-list actors including Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson who vamp about looking dreary and desiccated.Essentially its a young love Gothic involving a teen witch (Alice Englert pretty good) and the happy-go-lucky high school misfit (Alden Ehrenreich) who falls for her. Writer-director Richard LaGravanese (he wrote ""The Fisher King"") is too smart for this sort of thing so he outsmarts himself by playing everything too straight. (Mustnt mess up the franchise.) A dash - only a dash - of Tim Burton ghoulishness might have helped. Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for violence scary images and some sexual material.)

Comments click to enlarge Beautiful Creatures Recommended Video Rated PG-13  123 minutes  2013 Adapted from a young adult novel by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl this fantasy about witches and warlocks walking among us was clearly produced for the Twilight crowd but a witty script and the enjoyably hammy performances from Emma Thompson and Jeremy Irons broaden its appeal. Much of the movies pleasure derives from its acidic portrayal of a small town in South Carolina whose soul-crushing culture of Christianity and Civil War reenactments has driven a bright rebellious high schooler (Alden Ehrenreich) deep into the world of classic underground literature (Kurt Vonnegut Anthony Burgess Henry Miller et al). At school he bonds with a fellow eccentric (Alice Englert) who harbors supernatural powers and must decide on her 16th birthday whether she wants to use them for good or evil.

Still ""Beautiful Creatures"" has more than a few things going for it a strong female protagonist a lovely (though bleak) color palette and a more complex story arc than your average ""Twilight"" film. For fans of Valentines Day activities this is a nice little treat. ""Beautiful Creatures"" opens by considering teenager Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich) his sense of alienation and his great love of literature. Hes a small-town kid who desperately wants out the fictional town of Gatlin South Carolina is really cramping his style. Initially Ethans Southern accent feels forced but as the film progresses he gains a firmer hand on the dialect. ""Beautiful Creatures"" also goes to the well a little early on the voiceover technique but soon recovers largely dropping the method near the end. There seems to be some tragic backstory involving Ethans parents (Full disclosure Im a non-reader of the book) so Amma (Viola Davis) watches over him making sure he makes it to class and has adequate meals. A new year of high school is starting and Ethans feelings on the matter arent super positive. However when he notices a new girl Lena (Alice Englert) whom everyone else seems to instantly hate hes smitten. Its a pretty basic setup perfunctory even but its sufficient enough to get us to the main thrust of the plot. Lena has some big hurdles ahead of her shes dealing with a curse her fate hangs in the balance and mean-spirited relatives arent helping the situation any. Lena and Ethan become entangled in something bigger than either can handle alone and its here the film gains real momentum. ""Beautiful Creatures"" rests entirely upon the shoulders of leads. And in that sense it completely works. As Ethan the local boy who wants out and Lena the sullen girl with powers ""Beautiful Creatures"" does well to portray them as authentic teens. Its a film built on large dollops of romance and first love but its no less effective for the method. The chemistry between actors Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert is quite strong solving many of the films most immediate issues. The execution from director Richard LaGravenese is steady throughout and there are themes occasionally hit upon that are better than your average romance. Another solid aspect of ""Beautiful Creatures"" is the striking visuals. Its often gray or dark green offering lush landscapes and moody templates for our characters to play upon. The great majority of the film is only Ethan and Lena with other characters floating in and out of their field of vision though plenty of sepia-toned historical intonations are hinted at as well. Alice Englerts character of Lena also deserves high praise its nice to see the traditional love story flipped on its head to reflect changing gender roles. The largest dings on this film are presented in the form of shabby editing. Entire plot lines are completely ignored for half an hour only to be weirdly re-introduced and without any fluidity. The logic presented with regards to memory erasing and time-shifting is also extremely dubious and thats even after you factor in the entire ""everyone has supernatural ability"" angle. It shouldnt be a structural defect to have to deal with spells teens with powers and ancient curses every franchise from ""Harry Potter"" to ""X-Men"" has tackled this phenomenon effectively. No its the manner in which ""Beautiful Creatures"" considers these curveballs which comes off as relatively unsophisticated. This is the only arena where the film is actively worse than something like ""Twilight"" other than that from acting to visual artistry ""Beautiful Creatures"" wins by pure knockout against most young adult fiction adaptations. The measure of any truly great fictional world is the desire you have to return to it and its here that ""Beautiful Creatures"" thrives. The town of Gatlin the complicated relationship between Ethan and Lena the idea of ""casters"" (they dont like to be called witches) walking among us these are the elements that lend ""Beautiful Creatures"" a quirky seductiveness. The film has real moments of well beauty and any romantic will find something to appreciate here. Sure this film could have gone horribly wrong but the characters and chemistry are strong and as such ""Beautiful Creatures"" should be lauded for elegantly delivering a tale that at least feels fresh and vibrant. Grade B When not pondering casters Laremy writes books about film criticism . Hes open to the idea of a woman being able to smote his enemies.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> It starts sweetly kind of. Young love blooms between Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich) a literati wannabe stuck in small-town small-minded Gatlin South Carolina and Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) a visiting witch. Much is made of the two reading and quoting Kurt Vonnegut Henry Miller and the street poetry of Charles Bukowski. Its all southern-fried bullshit of course. The two bond best over pop culture references such as Lloyd Dobler and his boombox in Say Anything. Ethan has this theory that (spoiler alert) Leo didnt have to drown at the end of Titanic. Why didnt Leo and Kate just take turns on that piece of driftwood? Good point. Writer-director Richard LaGravenese who wrote The Fisher King and the underrated Living Out Loud shows a genuine feel for give-and-take among teen outliers. And Ehrenreich the star of Francis Ford Coppolas Tetro and Twixt and Englert (Ginger and Rosa) daughter of The Pianos Jane Campion have genuine screen chemistry. Too bad it all goes to crap when the plot kicks in. Start the blame with the Young Adult bestseller by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl that spawned Beautiful Creatures. Its warmed-over Twilight with witches instead of vamps only the witches are called casters as in spell casters. When Lena hits her 16th birthday shell be called to fight with the light side or the dark side. Its a bigger yawn than it sounds. As supernatural types Oscar winners Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson overact so strenuously and with such outrageously awful Southern accents that you fear the damage this crock may do to their reputations.

Based on the first of the four-novel Caster Chronicles series by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl the film blends witchcraft small-town conservatism and the usual tale of mismatched lovers. It starts well. Adapted by director-writer Richard LaGravenese who wrote the screenplays for The Fisher King and The Ref the early scenes are peppered with sardonic commentary from 17-year-old Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) a high-school misfit whos the opposite of proud of his South Carolina hometown where only ""the stupid and the stuck"" remain. Screen grab from an online trailer for ""Beautiful Creatures"" Movies Beautiful Creatures The official trailer ""They keep re-enacting the Civil War like its gonna come out different"" he moans.His father never seen and his mother dead Ethan lives independently occasionally helped out by his late mothers best friend the town librarian and historian Amma (Viola Davis). In preparation for his imminent exit to a faraway college he seeks out books on the school librarys banned list works by Ayn Rand Henry Miller and Kurt Vonnegut and Harper Lees To Kill a Mockingbird.The town of Gatling has its own version of Lees reclusive Boo Radley. In the ramshackle and mysterious house on the outside of town Ravenwood Manor lives the rarely seen town weirdo Macon Ravenwood a reputed Satanist but also scion of the towns founding family. Things get shaken up when his niece a dark-haired 15-year-old beauty named Lena (Alice Englert) comes to live with him and enrolls in the local high school. Ethan immediately recognizes her as a kindred soul - she reads Charles Bukowski and wears too much mascara - and also the girl who he has repeatedly seen in his dreams set on a Civil War battlefield.Her religious fundamentalist classmates decide Lena is an agent of the devil and pester her until shes irked enough to telekinetically blow the windows out of her classroom - evidently confirming their suspicions. Soon Ethan learns that the courtly Macon and Lena are part of a family of witches or ""casters"" as they prefer (as in spell casters). When Lena turns 16 she will go through a female-only ritual called the Claiming which determines whether she will be a bad or good caster for the rest of eternity. In either case she shouldnt be hooking up with a mortal.What promised to be a teen screwball comedy with a supernatural twist soon descends into special-effects overkill and camp acting from the overqualified supporting cast with British thespians Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson hamming it up like players in a Christmas pantomime. Irons as the Southern aristocrat with a touch of Bela Lugosi plays Chopin and drawls on about the ""voluminous backsides"" of the local women folk. Thompson shows up in a double role - as a busybody named Mrs. Lincoln and as the boisterously evil shape-shifting ""caster"" Sarafine Duchannes.Also arriving in town in preparation for Lenas significant 16th birthday is her sexy cousin Ridley (Emmy Rossum) who has already gone to the dark side. That means she drives a BMW convertible walks around in black see-through lingerie and seduces young men - apparently as an example of the tragic future that might befall Lena.Within the needlessly complicated script and CGI special-effects overkill there are some promising moments. Ehrenreich (Tetro and the upcoming Stoker) has an aw-shucks warmth thats more appealing than the usual dreamboat-with-cheekbones teen lover and Alice Englert (daughter of Australian film director Jane Campion) is an intelligent subtle young actress. Yet - forgive the pun - theres nothing much at stake here for a young witch plotting her future The Southern-fundamentalist rubes are irritatingly easy targets and Lena as a girl rebel has to make the choice between becoming a trouble-causing hottie or a mildly sarcastic young woman who likes to read. I cant wait for the sequel where she has to face a really tough decision like choosing a college major.

Its much better. By Mary Pols MaryPolsFeb. 13 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle John Bramley / Alcon Entertainment / Warner Bros. Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The supernatural-themed teen-targeted movie Beautiful Creatures is being marketed as the new Twilight. This is a mistake on multiple levels. First for movie critics this is like being told a new sort of hemorrhoid is headed their way. But more important it does a disservice to the movie it turns out writer/director Richard LaGraveneses adaptation of the young-adult fantasy series by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl is actually quite good. But such comparisons are not entirely unexpected given that Beautiful Creatures tells the tale of (yet another) young mortal who pursues a forbidden love with a powerful teenaged supernatural being. Only this time it is the girl who has great powers. Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) is a witch or in this narratives parlance a ""caster"" Her soulmate is high school junior Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich). We learn that Ethans recently widowed father refuses to leave his bedroom leaving Ethan to shop for groceries cook their meals and plow through the novels of Kurt Vonnegut on his lonesome.  The town librarian (Viola Davis) is the only adult who seems to be looking out for him. Ethan suffers from insomnia and takes long midnight runs through his small South Carolina town where the residents live for the annual Civil War enactment. ""Like its going to turn out different"" Ethan says in voice-over narration. Hes sharp and charming. When he does sleep his dreams are filled with a beautiful raven-haired girl. (READ A Qamp;A with the Beautiful Creatures authors) That girl of course would be Lena-turning up  in his high school history class shortly thereafter. Shes come to live with her uncle Macon Ravenwood (Jeremy Irons) regarded as something of a scary recluse. Her parents are dead (""fire"" she explains tersely) and shes been passed from one relative to another. Shes come to live with her Uncle Macon for protection; with her 16th birthday fast approaching shell be claimed by one of the opposing forces of the witch or ""caster"" world light or dark in a rite of passage that parallels mortal adolescence. Local rumors have it that the Ravenwoods are Satanists naturally the Bible-thumping high-school girls are horrible to her. After her first miserable day of school Ethan rescues her in the rain and gives her a lift home. He tries to relate to her by talking about Titanic (one of many pop culture references LaGravenese incorporates adroitly). Shes never seen it and opens her copy of  Charles Bukowskis You Get So Alone at Times That It Just Makes Sense. ""He any good?"" he asks. ""Define good"" she says with a smirk. Hes mesmerized. And well he should be. Englert the daughter of director Jane Campion (The Piano) and film-crew veteran Colin Englert is radiantly beautiful. But more than that shes interesting a young actress who presents as an old soul. Theres something hauntingly familiar about her-a curious trait as her mother is resolutely a behind-the-camera person. When I saw Englert in Sally Potters Ginger amp; Rosa (slated for a March release) I thought she was a dead ringer for Emily Blunt. In Beautiful Creatures she reminded me alternately of Blunt Debra Winger a young Demi Moore; and in terms of tone of voice and confidence Jennifer Lawrence. Perhaps the worst that can be said of her performance is that her Southern accent goes in and out. The chemistry between her and the appealing Ehrenreich is strong and sweet. He (and Dennis Quaid) have that rarest kind of ""aw shucks"" smile the kind that actually them more likeable. (READ TIMES Richard Corliss on Jane Campions The Piano) There are a lot of witchy special effects in Beautiful Creatures including glimpses of a cursed Civil War-era witch-mortal couple with parallels to Lena and Ethan an apocalyptic storm that swirls over the towns hallowed Civic War battleground and some ""casters combat"" between Lena and a cousin (Emmy Rossum) that involves a nauseating spinning dining room table. None of these did nearly as much for me as the sight of Irons all silky Southern menace acting opposite Davis (who ends up playing Giles to Lenas Buffy for all you Vampire Slayer fans) or squaring off against Emma Thompson. She plays the towns chief religious zealot who leads the charge to have Lena banned from the high school. Due to some supernatural interference Thompson gets to display a second very different side. She treats this teen movie like an acting vacation seething and primping and relishing every second. Its she who delivers the movies most interesting message. ""Love is a spell humans created to give females something to play with instead of power."" Garcia and Stohl have written four books about these witches-if this movie spawns any sequels maybe well see more of that viewpoint. I hope it does; Beautiful Creatures is good fun and I want to know what happens next for Lena the teenaged witch.

"Beautiful Creatures (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Beautiful Creatures (PG-13) The first film in an intended series based on the young adult fantasy novels doesnt cast much of a spell. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com2/14/2013 Editor rating 2 Based on the first novel in a young adult fantasy series Beautiful Creatures is a clear bid to ignite a franchise capable of filling the hole left in teenage hearts by the end of the Twilight saga. If only the filmmakers had tried to make those young hearts pound over a better movie. Theres potential here a decent story and a cast well-stocked with grownup cinematic luminaries. But this supernatural Gothic romance is a prisoner of its own demons which include sketchy Southern accents tacky and tired stereotypes and faux homespun dialogue in the wrong mouths. ""I missed the exit to fascinating"" or ""Some girls are mad dogs son -- you can either run or shoot"" seem unlikely folksy wisdom to spill from the mouths of 16-year-old boys. The story swaps the Twilight roles and happily provides an ingenue with more pep than Twilights bland Bella (though less animal magnetism than Robert Pattinsons Edward Cullen which is going to be a problem for the target audience). Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) is a high school junior in dead-end Gatlin S.C. a town with nothing much to show for itself except a fanatical devotion to its Confederate past. Ethan is a rebel in the mildest ways possible. He sings along with Bob Dylan and loves to read especially Kurt Vonnegut. He refuses to continue dating the shallow popular girl and cant wait to graduate and get out of town. But Ethan whose mother is dead and father so reclusive we never see him has a secret Hes plagued by dreams of a mysterious dark-haired beauty. Her name is Lena Duchannes and one day she appears in class. She lives in the secluded dilapidated old mansion far from decent folk with her creepy uncle (Jeremy Irons who for the role has apparently borrowed a floor-length jacket from Princes Cream period to throw over some pastel Captain Kirk casualwear). The popular girls say Lena and her uncle are devil worshippers mostly because all the religious people in Gatlin are hysterical praise-Jesusy lunatics who gather in the middle of the night to watch lightning strike and pronounce it a demonic not meteorological event. Theyre right about one thing though Lena (Alice Englert daughter of filmmaker Jane Campion) is different. Shes a ""caster"" and on her looming 16th birthday supernatural forces will ""claim"" her for good or for evil. Male casters can determine their own fates but Lena has no choice. The whole process is like the Sorting Hat at Hogwarts only sexist. Ethan tells Lena he knows shes good at heart but Lena is skeptical. They enlist the help of the town librarian (Viola Davis; seriously that Viola Davis) to try and thwart the inevitable. Also to be dealt with a curse time travel and a Civil War re-enactment which would be enough to make anyone call on the dark forces of destruction. Director Richard LaGravenese (P.S. I Love You Freedom Writers) cant quite make up his mind whether he wants Beautiful Creatures to be pure Southern Gothic or Dark Shadows Lite so we get a silly dinner scene with a spinning table and pink-haired relatives that undermines the films dark tone. On the bright side Emma Thompson seems to be enjoying herself as an outraged Bible thumper and Eileen Atkins and Emmy winner Margo Martindale (Justified) make brief appearances as members of Lenas bizarre family; perhaps theyll score recurring roles if theres a sequel. There may be; Beautiful Creatures leaves its story room to continue and its message of female empowerment is solid. If only there were a spell to make us forget all the mistakes.

(WARNER BROS.) Lena Duchannes lives alone with her uncle Macon in an old mansion dripping with shadows and Spanish moss. She is a dark strange girl who pushes people away and attracts whispered gossip. ""My familys different"" she haltingly explains to the one boy who follows her home when everyone else seems to want to burn her at the stake. ""We do things. We do different things."" ""So what -- youre from Europe?"" he wonders. OK well clearly -- despite the many shots of him reading novels -- this is not a kid from the gifted-and-talented class. Because any moderately intelligent person can tell you this witchy girl is a spellbinder. Literally. In ""Beautiful Creatures"" though shes called a Caster -- and thats not the worst of it. She also has some strange ceremony coming up on her 16th birthday when shell be committed to either Light or Dark magic. And shes got an evil mother. And a mad cousin. And you thought your teen years were awkward. The original young-adult book had even more going on but filmmaker Richard LaGravenese has tried to simplify it. Even so the movies mythology seems confused if not outright contradictory. And some of what remains seems full of calculated familiarity -- as if original writers Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl tried step-by-step to replicate ""Twilight."" Instead its more like Twi-lite. Angsty monster in high school? Check. Lovestruck mortal? Yup. Warring factions within the extended supernatural family? Got em. A true love that must be denied so that the human beloved can survive? Well lets not give too much away. Still you can pretty much predict not only the plot of this one but of the obviously intended sequel(s). Theres nothing really new here and the special-effects arent very special looking unreal when they should be surreal. All thats a shame because LaGravenese is a smart writer whos always had a particularly fine and generous feel for love stories and flawed female protagonists. (Unfortunately many of the ones hes directed - whether the terrific ""Living Out Loud"" or perfectly fine ""P.S. I Love You"" -- failed to catch fire with fans.) Here unfortunately his young leads -- Alice Englert and Alden Ehrenreich -- dont give him much to work with. Englert comes off as more wounding than wounded; you wonder what anyone would see in her. And the bland Ehrenreich conveys nothing but a Southern California boy trying very very hard to sound like a Southerner -- and missing by a country mile. LaGravanese gets more help from the veterans in his cast particularly Jeremy Irons as Mason and Emma Thompson as an intolerant small-town gossip. And Emmy Rossum is definitely having a ball as Lenas vampy older cousin strutting across the screen in barely-there lace and lip-smacking anticipation. But despite the frequent bursts of lightning theres no real heat or fire -- no sense of doomed love nor the kind of feverish melodrama that filled five installments of the Edward-and-Bella show. The pretty people are on hand and the spooky settings. But the magic never happens. Ratings note The film contains violence and sensuality. Beautiful Creatures (PG-13) Warner Bros. (123 min.)

"Beautiful Creatures review Slow southern sorcery | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBeautiful Creatures review Slow southern sorceryTrouble is a-brewin and Beautiful Creatures is in no hurry to get there. Still the supernatural teen romance is not without its charms. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 14 2013 Beautiful Creatures 2.5 stars Starring Alden Ehrenreich Alice Englert Jeremy Irons Emma Thompson Viola Davis and Emmy Rossum. Written and directed by Richard LaGravenese. 123 minutes. Opens Feb. 14 at major theatres. PG A momentous life change awaits Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) upon her 16th birthday shell officially become a witch or simply remain a bitch. The terminology in Beautiful Creatures  a movie of heaving bosoms hearty winks and atrocious southern accents is that Lena will be ""claimed"" by family voodoo and involuntarily turned Dark (extremely witchy) or Light (merely bitchy). Article Continued Below You might well argue theres not much difference between the two and thats certainly the view of Lenas erstwhile boyfriend Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich) who is tired of being treated as a doormat by fretful Lena and her freaky kinfolk. But Ethan appreciates absurdity maybe because he looks like a younger version of Johnny Knoxville from Jackass . So does the movie which makes this inevitable attempt to fill the post- Twilight void of supernatural teen romance easy to take. Its based on the first book of the four-volume (and counting) Caster Chronicles by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl. An avid reader of Kurt Vonnegut Charles Bukowski Ayn Rand and other brainy cynics Ethan is the smartest kid in the very dumb town of Gatlin S.C. Its a backwater burgh where the bijou always misspells movie titles on the marquee and where gun nuts ""keep re-enacting the Civil War like its going to turn out different."" The local hicks also have a habit of making snap judgments as hicks are wont to do. Theyre immediately disdainful of Lena when she comes to town just because shes sarcastic standoffish and also the niece of dotty Macon Ravenwood (Jeremy Irons) who lives in a mansion that looks as if it were built by the Addams Family but decorated by Liberace. Hes pleased to meet you hope you guess his name but Macon isnt really all that satanic or witchy or whatever the heck his kind are (they prefer the term ""caster""). Hed rather Google than conjure and would sooner tickle his ivories than summon dark forces. Macon has learned to control his dark side unlike female members of the family -- sexism alert Lenas comely mama Sarafine (Emma Thompson) and red-hot cousin Ridley (Emmy Rossum) must have checked both the ""witch"" and ""bitch"" boxes during their own claiming ceremonies. They disapprove of Lena messing around with a Muggle (sorry wrong franchise) but theyre just out to cause trouble for the hell of it. Shape-shifting Sarafine has assumed the form of Gatlins chief morals enforcer Mrs. Lincoln and now shes an even busier busybody than before. It all has something to do with loves and grudges that go right back to the Civil War (maybe those re-enactors arent so dumb after all). Trouble is a-brewin but Beautiful Creatures is in no hurry to get there or to make the story excessively grave. This may disappoint moviegoers who prefer to see bloody bite marks and exploding heads. Writer/director Richard LaGravenese ( P.S. I Love You ) prefers to concentrate on the slow-blooming romance between Lena and Ethan who actually talk more like real teens than the brooding vamps brats and chumps of the Twilight series. There is no real sex in Beautiful Creatures  but there are naughty thoughts and comments. Such as when Ethan watches Lena do the magic beanstalk thing with some vines outside her bedroom window and wryly asks ""Can you make anything grow?"" Its also a movie that knows not to oversell the sorcery. These casters can be every bit as confused as humans. ""Just because theyre supernatural dont make them any smarter"" observes Amma (Viola Davis) Gatlins resident historian/soothsayer. If only we could hope that Beautiful Creatures would stick to a single film or a maximum of one sequel before its modest charms wear out. Thats probably too much to wish for given that Twilight managed to profitably stretch its saga to five movies. They should heed the words of one of Gatlins other smart alecs who offers this thought prior to one of those misspelled movie screenings ""Satan hates sequels too.""

Starring Emma Thompson Jeremy Irons Thomas Mann Emmy Rossum Viola Davis Zoey Deutch Margo Martindale Andrea Frankle Alden Ehrenreich Alice Englert Director Richard LaGravenese Running time 204 Release Opened Feb 14 2013  Editorial Review A sweet love story lost in a witchs cauldronBy Michael OSullivanThursday February 14 2013Wow. Just wow. That pretty much sums up my reaction to ""Beautiful Creatures"" a movie so schizoid in its extremes of pleasure and pain that its hard to know how to weigh its contradictions or even where to begin separating them. On the plus side this ""Twilight""-esque tale of paranormal teen love -- which centers on the relationship between a human high school boy and a 15-year-old witch or ""caster"" -- is anchored by two surprisingly solid and sweet performances. As the handsome but bookish Ethan Alden Ehrenreich has charm to burn narrating the film with wisecracking good humor and lighting up the screen with an unforced grace. In the role of his literally bewitching crush Lena the teenage witch Alice Englert is just as appealing. The actress who is the daughter of filmmakers Jane Campion and Colin Englert may not exactly be Hollywood pretty but shes got oodles of presence not to mention a shyly captivating smile. Best of all this pair has real chemistry. Youll have no trouble believing that these two kids could be a couple even considering their incompatibility. Adapted for the screen by director Richard LaGravenese from the young-adult novel by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl the story captivates at least initially. Theres a nice sense of suspense as Ethan starts to court Lena a slightly Goth-y newcomer to his sleepy South Carolina home town. For the first half of the film it isnt clear what is going on as the towns devout Christians ostracize Lena for her strange ways which include an ability to shatter windows and a strange affinity for lightning. For his part Ethan seems to be losing his grip on reality thanks to Lenas uncle (a deliciously loopy Jeremy Irons) who zaps the boy with a bit of hocus-pocus to discourage him from dating his niece. Thats the good news. The bad news is that LaGravenese just doesnt seem to know how to rein in the films more fantastical plot elements. As she approaches her 16th birthday Lena must face the possibility that she could be ""claimed"" by the unwholesome side of her powers unless shes strong enough to resist it. Advocating for the black arts is her mother (Emma Thompson) who suddenly shows up with Lenas cousin the evil witch Ridley (Emmy Rossum) to advocate for the more unsavory side of necromancy. The two display a histrionic lack of restraint that puts ""Mommie Dearest"" to shame. At this point the movie isnt just over the top; its cray-cray. A showdown between Lena and Ridley features a spinning dining room table rendered with a low-budget special effect that looks like something out of ""Wizards of Waverly Place."" LaGravenese seems to have borrowed other stylistic touches from such parodies of the paranormal as ""Vampires Suck"" and the recent ""Dark Shadows"" remake. Thats a shame really because theres lots to like here including a relatively subdued performance by Viola Davis as Amma a sort of occult librarian who helps Lena research ways in which she can resist her mothers Darth Vader-like influence and hang on to her boyfriend. LaGravenese made his name as a writer adapting other peoples books (""The Bridges of Madison County""). As a director his career has been lackluster at best (""Living Out Loud""). His screenplay for ""Beautiful Creatures"" is sharp and witty considering the needlessly complicated source material. His cast is stellar and the chemistry between his young stars magical. But too much of rest of the movie like Thompsons monstrous mother is an unholy mess.Contains obscenity sensuality scary images and some violence. An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of director Richard LaGravenese.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Beautiful Creatures is an oddball creation a morality play with no basic understanding of morality. On the surface the plot drawn and significantly modified from Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohls 2009 young-adult novel is obsessed with the battle between good and evil. Its odd to contemplate a story that actually needs to define those poles but odder still to watch a film that doesnt have any conception of them at all. Alden Ehrenreich stars as an amiable small-town jock whose bookish obsessions make him stand out from his peers particularly the improbably beautiful mean-girl ex (Zoey Deutch) whos still pursuing him. Then he falls for the strange new girl in town (Alice Englert) niece of the much-whispered-about Boo Radley-esque town hermit (Jeremy Irons). Soon Ehrenreich finds out Englert is a ""Caster"" from a long line of magically endowed non-humans and that shes due to be ""claimed by the Light or the Dark"" on her rapidly approaching 16th birthday. For reasons elucidated in the book and ignored in the film ""female Casters"" dont get to choose whether theyre absorbed into Team Good or Team Evil. And since she lacks any agency in her immensely dramatic choice she spends much of the film pushing Ehrenreich away for his own good and angsting endlessly about the deadline while her colorful family (including Emmy Rossum and Justifieds Margo Martindale) and Ehrenreichs caretaker (Viola Davis) snipe and jockey for position around her. Writer-director Richard LaGravenese is more accustomed to scripting glossy prestige romances (Water For Elephants The Horse Whisperer The Bridges Of Madison County) than directing this sort of heady Twilight descendant but his touch here probably means less than the presence of cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (Tim Burtons lensmeister on Big Fish Planet Of The Apes and Charlie And The Chocolate Factory) and production designer Richard Sherman (The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn 1 and 2). Those two men give the film a lush cold look that veers from scene to scene between Burtons colorful rococo-goth darkness and Twilights desaturated chill. In Beautiful Creatures looks are everything Its particularly significant that viewers can tell how close Englert feels to her evil side at any given moment by how lavishly she dresses and how much eyeliner shes wearing. But thats the films only grasp of its own supposed core concepts. Beautiful Creatures never explores what ""claimed by the Dark"" actually means other than showing that Dark Caster Rossum came away from her Claiming with glowing gold CGI eyes revealing black clothing and a generally bitchy attitude. It never explains why Ehrenreich and Englerts banal Romeo and Juliet relationship is supposedly a bad thing that might tip the balance for the Dark. And the only hints at world-building are done via single throwaway sentences that suggest untold stories far more intriguing than this one. Theres no sense of the larger conflict beyond the protagonists backwater burg and no stakes past Englerts feelings that shes cornered and doomed. Only Emma Thompson--hamming it up enjoyably as a Dark-sider so villainous her intentions beyond ""be evil hate humans"" can never be described or revealed--appears to be taking all this meaningless arbitrary sturm und drang with the cracked humor it deserves. Everyone else applies their fiercest frowns most pained expressions and most melodramatic line readings to a battle thats all empty overheated air. In a film where good and evil are just empty words its hard to care which one Englerts character has to put on her future business cards.

Photo AP The danger of trying to do a supernatural comedy-romance is that youll wind up being as funny as ""Twilight"" with all the raw sexual energy of ""Bewitched."" ""Beautiful Creatures"" isnt quite that bad though it did make me long for the cleverer ""Dark Shadows"" (which I liked more than most did). This ones a sort of Civil War-inflected contemporary love-horror show that features such scary moments as a teen making windows shatter a banquet table that spins like its on a turntable and Jeremy Irons attempting a Southern accent. Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich who bears an unfortunate resemblance to Johnny Knoxville) is a South Carolina orphan who reads books that were considered controversial 50 years ago and yearns to break free of the South. His minder (Viola Davis) a librarian once promised his mother to keep him safe but mainly this consists of delivering his meals. No parents but full maid service? Already the movie is a teen dream although I can hear the 17-year-olds in the audience muttering that the deal is off if they have to read J.D. Salinger. The freaky new girl Lena (an appealingly quiet Alice Englert daughter of filmmaker Jane Campion) lives in the local haunted mansion kept by the mysterious Ravenwood clan headed by her uncle Macon (Irons). When the Christian girls at school encouraged by the town evangelical (Emma Thompson) tease Lena about being a Satanist she responds by accidentally on purpose making the windows explode in the other kids faces. She and her family are ""casters"" which is the new PC term for witches. On her 16th birthday shell get signed up permanently for either the dark side or the light side though theres also this Civil War-era curse on her which makes it kinda look like the light sides chances arent so good. But hey as demonstrated by her wicked cousin Ridley (Emmy Rossum) being a dark caster means you get sexy black-lace outfits vampy makeup and a tendency to kill the boys for fun. Stick to the light side and apparently you get stuck with the baby-sitter look forever. Lena and Ethan have been having these dreams about each other in Civil War times when she pictures herself as a Southern belle and he as a Confederate soldier. And thanks to a highly contrived Civil War re-enactment (in which Ethan participates for some reason despite knowing its lame) theyll relive their Olden Days drama again. Not that Im complaining. It sets up the ladies for a climax in which everybody is spilling out of their big wenchy low-cut Tara hoop dresses while they fire spells all over the place. There are worse ways to pass the time. And after girl-meets-vampire and girl-meets-zombie movies at least in this one its the young lady who gets to do cool stuff leaving the boy to be the girl. You will have guessed that the film is based on a tweener novel hence the virgin-slut dynamic the dress-up games the worries about not fitting in at school the family from hell and the Corleone-sized thirst for vengeance. Some of this is pure ""Twilight"" in theme. Yet the tone is completely unlike Bellas earnest anguish. Writer-director Richard LaGravenese (""The Fisher King"") is the wrong man for this job Hes too smart to take the material seriously so he keeps throwing in jokes bits of camp pieces of flair. Lena makes it rain directly over Ethans head Irons raids David Bowies 1970s wardrobe Thompson seems to think shes on ""Saturday Night Live"" and we learn that the longtime ancestral home for casters was Washington DC -- until Nancy Reagan chased them away. The comedy defuses and deflates the drama frustrating those who would be swept away by belief.

"Beautiful Creatures movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Beautiful Creatures Supernatural love in a small town again  Beautiful Creatures Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune When classy pedigreed British actors go hog-wild under the flowering dogwood trees of a Southern Gothic setting often the results are good. Just as often theyre so bad theyre good. And sometimes as is the case with Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson in ""Beautiful Creatures"" theyre simply doing the best they can under the circumstances.Many in the target teen audience for this romantic fantasy taken from the young-adult novels by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl will be unfamiliar with the names or faces of Irons and Thompson. These kids today No respect for talent recognized by awards bestowed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. But Irons and Thompson whose Oscars arent likely to get any company for their supporting turns here at least bring the zest generally lacking from writer-director Richard LaGraveneses dutiful adaptation. A little ""True Blood"" a glint of ""Twilight"" ""Beautiful Creatures"" concerns forbidden teenage love down in Gatlin S.C. where life is a clique-y melange of mortals (humans) and ""casters"" or supernaturally gifted families whose warring impulses between good and evil are perpetually in conflict as they are in so many high schools.Bookish senior Ethan portrayed by Alden Ehrenreich is a kid plagued by a recurring Civil War-era nightmare (Help Im trapped in an outtake from ""Lincoln"") he cannot explain or understand. The girl in his dream looks oddly like the mysterious new student in town Lena (Alice Englert daughter of filmmaker Jane Campion). Shunned by the snippy little book-banning mean-girl twits of Gatlin (""The Fountainhead""? This town bans ""The Fountainhead""??) Lena is one of a long line of casters. As she approaches her 16th birthday outcast Lena must prepare herself to be ""claimed"" by ""the dark."" Love for a mortal is no good for this special breed of caster who can telekinetically do whatever she likes with wind fire water and air. Shes like ""The Last Airbender"" with three bonus bends. Irons plays her creepy skulking Uncle Macon who dresses in Richard Chamberlain garb circa 1979 and pivots between sincere overprotection of his niece and something a little more supernaturally suggestive. Thompson shows up as the book-banning-est of the local fundamentalists intent on driving Lena out of town. Thompsons character is not what she seems. You cant say the same for the film which LaGravenese struggles to compact into a workable two-hours-plus-change franchise launch.""Loves a risk for anybody"" we learn and if thats not helpful enough Viola Davis (as the town librarian mythology expert and full-time wise onlooker) is around to dispense exposition and remind Ethan to ""stay away from that girl."" He cant natch and so ""Beautiful Creatures"" puts Lena between the rock of Ethan and the hard place of being ""claimed"" which I cant claim to fully understand except that it may have something to do with insurance claims. Irons simultaneously under- and over-plays rolling a variety of dialects around in gently recreational style while Thompson swings for the fences and why not? Actors of her droll caliber may not get back down to the American South again for a while.

"Movie review Beautiful Creatures has brains and bewitching cast - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowMovie review Beautiful Creatures has brains and bewitching cast tooRichard LaGraveneses Beautiful Creatures adaptation of the bestselling young-adult series navigates the story of a mortal and a caster (witch) as star-crossed lovers with nuance and flair.February 13 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Eileen Atkins left Alice Englert and Jeremy Irons star in ""Beautiful... (John Bramley Warner Bros. )Maybe there really are supernatural forces at work in this world. How else to explain ""Beautiful Creatures""? The movie is an intriguing intelligent enigma a three words not typically associated with teen romances.A couple of unknown heartthrobs provide the films X-factor while its angst lies in true loves struggle against otherworldly powers Civil War flashbacks literary conceits and high school friction.Besides any film that credibly references poet Charles Bukowski has my attention.Based on the first book in Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohls bestselling young-adult series ""Beautiful Creatures"" is also pure pop-culture confection. In adapting the novel writer-director Richard LaGravenese has been as ruthless as clever in compressing characters jettisoning convoluted action and sharpening dialogue.MORE Monster love Filling the post-Twilight voidThe movies got a cool alt-rock sound thanks to the haunting music of the Brit band thenewno2 and a graceful grunge look. To put it in perspective the movie reaches the artistic heights hoped for but never quite scaled by ""Twilight"" a heresy I know.Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert star as the young lovers Ethan and Lena. Ones a mortal the other a caster (who knew ""witch"" was so un-PC). They are caught in a Romeo and Juliet-esque maelstrom beautifully whipped up by a crack creative team including cinematographer Philippe Rousselot production designer Richard Sherman and effects wizards Matt Kutcher (special) and Joe Harkins (visual).As Ethan and Lena fight to survive high school and other unnatural forces Englert and Ehrenreich are so charged they practically give off sparks. Jeremy Irons Emma Thompson Viola Davis and Emmy Rossum bring their own electricity.The film is set in the fictional Gatlin S.C. a small town steeped in old-South sentimentality and superstition. There are two mysteries according to Ethan our narrator a why anyone stays and whether the crumbling plantation called Ravenwood is haunted. Like Scout in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" one of Ethans favorite books he is wise beyond his years and his thoughts frame the story.High school is just back in session with everyone slipping into their designated spot on the coolness scale when the arrival of Lena Duchannes the wind-blown raven-haired niece of Macon Ravenwood (Irons) sets things on edge. Particularly upset are the cheerleading sweet tarts Emily Asher (Zoey Deutch) who is also Ethans ex and Savannah Snow (Tiffany Boone) the mayors daughter. Their sniping quickly gets to the new girl whose distress shatters the windows right in the middle of class.Lena turns out to be a glass-shattering natural make that Natural a a caster with ginormous powers most having to do with roiling the weather patterns. Ethan falls hard and fast but he was already primed since Lena was haunting his dreams long before she set her combat boots in Gatlin. If her powers hadnt cursed her her thrift-store chic would. (Kudos to costume designer Jeffrey Kurland for this and much more.)PHOTOS Hollywood Backlot momentsThe film turns on Lenas rapidly approaching 16th birthday. Its the witching hour so to speak for all Ravenwood casters a the moment their fate is sealed souls claimed by either the darkness or the light. Theres a curse that must be broken a Civil War re-enactment that must take place and the town folk to appease. Then theres the old locket that keeps dropping the couple into the middle of a Civil War-era battle. Its a lot.When it comes to conflict the film has a gift in its central villain a a two-fer of sorts with a deliciously evil Thompson playing the local blowhard a Daughters of the American Revolution devotee named Mrs. Lincoln a and Sarafine a the most powerful caster in the world who quickly takes control of the debate and Mrs. Lincolns body. Irons Uncle Macon is in charge of style the interior design of Ravenwood changing to match his fuming that mortals and immortals shouldnt mix. Ridley (Rossum) Lenas sexy dark caster cousin and Amma (Davis) the town librarian come bearing their own agendas.In the midst of all this confusion a and anchoring the film a is Ethan and Lenas love story. Both actors are good at mining the emotional cross-currents that keep that first love so rocky.Perhaps we should expect the daughter of director Jane Campion to be exceptional but there is a distinctive quality and depth to Englerts acting that has the feel of something special. Ehrenreich who manages a drawl as thick as molasses is one of the most appealing actors to come along in some time shifting effortlessly among the movies many moods.As does the director a handling the visual and emotional swings of ""Beautiful Creatures"" with real finesse. Though LaGravenese got an Oscar nomination for ""The Fisher King"" screenplay his writing/directing efforts a ""P.S. I Love You"" and ""Freedom Writers"" the bigger ones a havent quite gelled. Until now. It seems the filmmaker has found the secret to making a teenagers heartthrob a give them a brain along with the beauty.Beautiful CreaturesMPAA rating PG-13 for violence scary images and some sexual materialRunning time 2 hours 4 minutesPlaying In general releasebetsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORE FROM HERO COMPLEX HERO COMPLEX Pop culture unmasked PHOTOS 60 images from The Hobbit VIDEO GAMES The latest news and reviews MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESJack the Giant Slayer soars to top of DVD sales chartJuly 1 2013New Releases Side Effects Beautiful Creatures and moreMay 19 2013Beautiful Creatures stars are in it for the long haulFebruary 18 2013Beautiful Creatures score leads Dhani Harrison to Abbey...February 15 2013A Good Day to Die Hard to rule Presidents Day box officeFebruary 14 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentEthanCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-beautiful-creatures-review-20130214,0,3924814.story",200,beautifulcreatures(2013)21,beautifulcreatures(2013),latimes

Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review   1/2 our of fourStars Alden Ehrenreich Alice Englert Viola Davis Emma Thompson Jeremy IronsRated PG-13; runtime 2 hours 4 minutes; opens Thursday nationwideFans of Southern Gothic mysteries and the TV show Charmed should be enticed by Beautiful Creatures (  1/2 stars out of four; rated PG-13; opening Thursday nationwide).But this teen supernatural fantasy is clearly aiming for the much huger Twilight fan base.Unlike the massively popular vampire series this romp into the occult has a potent sense of humor. That comic edge and strong dialogue raises the movies quality over most teen romances.Theres a Romeo-and-Juliet-style romance at the heart of the tale. Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) is a smart and sensitive high schooler who avidly reads Kurt Vonnegut and William Burroughs and cant wait to escape his small South Carolina town and its narrow-minded denizens.""They keep re-enacting the Civil War like its gonna come out different"" he says in an amusing voice-over narration.Ethan meets Lena (Alice Englert) a mysterious new girl in town who reads Charles Bukowski. Smells like teen spiritual soul mates. The pair uncovers secrets about their town their respective family histories and the nature of Southern-fried hocus pocus. But the path of young love is rarely smooth. In this case the hiccup is Lenas occult lineage Shes a 15-year-old witch-in-training.Lead actor Ehrenreich conveys a spirited charm while Englert the object of his affections is more blandly self-contained -- despite being on the cusp of becoming a ""caster"" the sorcerers preferred term (as in ""spell-caster""). As such Lena is able to conjure up mighty winds and when taunted at school break classroom windows with her powers.The story is based on the young-adult novel -- the first in the Caster Chronicles series -- by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl. Stalwart British actors including Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson seem to relish speaking in extreme Southern accents. Irons provides many of the laughs as do some of the quips by young Ethan who cant wait to break free of the suffocating ties of the Bible-thumping town.Viola Davis plays Amma Ethans family friend. Shes a librarian and seer but shes not given the screen time she deserves. In contrast theres the scenery-chewing Thompson as shape-shifting Sarafine and Emmy Rossum as a sorceress named Ridley whose idea of wicked-witchwear is not a black pointed hat but the wardrobe of a Victorias Secret model. Irons is Macon Ravenwood an incubus who is Lenas uncle as well as a courtly if sardonic recluse.The evocative locations complete with a creepy old manor house sleepy bayous and trees covered in Spanish moss are ideal for this spooky-funny story.At its best while tossing off pop-culture humor -- much of it about movies -- and during the surprising reveal of the interior of Macons haunted house the film drags during some of the supernatural scenes and during gatherings of Lenas witchly clan.No big surprises mark this paranormal soap-opera-style romance with screwball comic moments. Though not enchanting Beautiful Creatures qualifies as an entertaining guilty pleasure.The magic of Beautiful CreaturesSkip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert reveal how the magic was kept real in their latest film Beautiful Creatures.

Area theaters. Who could have predicted that one day we would long for the relative subtlety of ""Twilight""? Richard LaGraveneses ""Beautiful Creatures"" is so outrageously florid Bella and Edwards baroque courtship looks understated by comparison. This time its mortal outsider Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) who pines for his supernatural beloved Lena (Alice Englert) in a small South Carolina town. Lena is a witch (or ""Caster"" as theyre called) and on her 16th birthday she will be claimed by either the Light or the Dark. She desperately wants to stay in the light but shes being pulled to the dark by her evil mother (Emma Thompson overdoing it). Love between mortals and Casters is forbidden but Ethan wont be denied. His sensible guardian (Viola Davis) and Lenas uncle (Jeremy Irons) are equally determined to help Lena save herself. The young-adult series of books on which the film is based is basically a more enlightened version of ""Twilight."" The heroine has her own powers plus a boyfriend who staunchly supports rather than moodily stalks her. But LaGravenese who wrote the script doesnt get it. This is a story about the frightening uncontrollable changes of adolescence not a mid-century Tennessee Williams melodrama. He lays the Southern soapiness on so thick we can barely find the characters under the kudzu. And are there no working actors actually from the South? Only someone with an authentic accent might have been able to sell this broadly drawled dialogue. Wide-eyed and goofy Ehrenreich plays Ethan more like Forrest Gump than a kid whod be into Bukowski and fall for the class witch. Englert (daughter of director Jane Campion) is better but she doesnt make the impact a more experienced actress might. Whats missing -- from the entire movie -- is that magical spark that can turn a film into a franchise. On mobile?

On the bright side maybe itll finally drive a stake through the heart of the whole genre. CAST Alden Ehrenreich Alice Englert Jeremy Irons Emma Thompson LENGTH 203 The ""Twilight"" movies ended their 3 billion run last year but they havent been forgotten -- particularly by film-studio executives. Heres their idea of a new twist What if sulky Bella Swan were a cheerful teenage boy and handsome vampire Edward Cullen a girl with magic powers? Shell still belong to a family of ancient aristocrats who wear amber contact lenses and haute couture of course. But instead of Forks Wash. theyll live in Gatlin S.C. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break The result ""Beautiful Creatures"" an adaptation of a young-adult novel that could only exist in a post-""Twilight"" world. Youthful newcomers Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert play Ethan Wate and Lena Duchannes a strange newcomer who turns out to be a ""Caster"" -- a witch basically. Her uncle Macon (Jeremy Irons slumming) discourages their romance for on Lenas 16th birthday she may suddenly turn evil. It runs in the family Her mother Serafine (an enjoyable Emma Thompson) certainly rhymes with witch. But love is strong and when the two teens get hormonal nearby objects get damaged. All right which ""Twilight"" ingredients arent here? For starters the weird sexuality that made those movies interesting and the dopey humor that made them slightly bearable. ""Beautiful Creatures"" doesnt even feel like its own world -- its someone elses -- and writer-director Richard LaGravenese (""P.S. I Love You"") makes a mess of it. Visually its chaos a mix of Tim Burton whimsy Gothic horror and ""Harry Potter"" fantasy (Viola Davis plays a wise librarian). Narratively its so muddled that the characters spend more time explaining the story than acting it out. Fighting for thematic dominance are the Civil War religion and -- get this -- Charles Bukowski. They all lose. In the end ""Beautiful Creatures"" has one overarching problem Its boring. ""Twilight"" was many things but never that. 155 EntertainmentTrailer Beautiful Creatures PLOT A small-town teenager falls for a new arrival with mysterious powers.

Pulpy sweet-natured and funny ""Beautiful Creatures"" adds a touch of camp to the supernatural teen romance Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics beautiful creatures Movies Our Picks Movies Science Fiction and Fantasy Twilight Entertainment News I greatly enjoyed the camped-up teen angst of ""Beautiful Creatures"" but I also suspect it might be analogous to those childrens books that are not so secretly meant for grown-ups. (My kids for example find the irony of the Lemony Snicket books impenetrable and the adventures overly dark.) Adapted by writer-director Richard LaGravenese from a young-adult bestseller by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl ""Beautiful Creatures"" plays like a funnier edgier Southern-gothic knockoff of the ""Twilight"" universe with a distinct liberal-secular sensibility and without the virginal sexuality po-faced seriousness or undertones of Christianity.Precisely those factors - along with the fact that the movies real stars are Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson in scenery-chewing supporting roles - may well reduce its appeal to teenage girls who presumably crave the ultra-earnest romantic intensity of the Twi-verse. Id love to be proven wrong on that forecast but for now Ill just insist that ""Beautiful Creatures"" is surprisingly fun and deserves much more of a look from adult viewers than its likely to get. LaGravenese a Hollywood veteran with a wobbly but intriguing resume that goes clear back to his Oscar-nominated screenplay for ""The Fisher King"" in 1991 has wrestled considerable humor emotion and atmosphere from this pulpy and derivative material.While the youthful leads in ""Beautiful Creatures"" may not have global Stewart-Pattinson appeal just yet they make an appealing duo with interesting chemistry. LaGravenese understands that in this sort of romance it helps to play with gender roles just a little under the surface. Alden Ehrenreich who plays sensitive small-town jock Ethan Wate has just a little feminine prettiness about him while Alice Englert (in real life the daughter of New Zealand Oscar-winning director Jane Campion) who plays sarcastic teenage witch Lena Duchannes is a bit tomboyish and spiky-looking. When the worldly-wise and faintly Goth Lena shows up in Ethans South Carolina hick town with her Charles Bukowski books the jocks and sorority types instantly shun her. Ethan owns a pair of glasses has read Kerouac or whatever and no longer believes in hell as a literal destination for all liberals and homosexuals so he sees Lena as a challenge. (I know the theory that anyone Lenas age still reads Bukowski seems more outrageous than any of the supernatural stuff.)Theres a general air of high-spirited small-town farce about ""Beautiful Creatures"" which may undercut the fervid romance a little but is highly entertaining. It turns out that the idiotic right-wing bigots in Ethans town have a point Lena lives just outside town with her dad Macon Ravenwood (Irons) in a house that looks like a crumbling plantation manse on the outside and on the inside like an insta-vulgar South Beach estate designed for the gay wedding of Jay-Z and A-Rod. With his stretched-out faux-Southern vowels coated in sorghum syrup and his skin like designer crocodile leather Irons seems to be channeling Katharine Hepburn playing Truman Capote or perhaps all of Tennessee Williams characters at the same time. You Might Also Like Lena and Macon as things turn out belong to the ancient race of ""casters"" known to the unenlightened as witches who are supposed to limit their entanglements with ordinary mortals romantic or otherwise. This partly has to do with the upcoming drama around Lenas 16th birthday when she will either be claimed by the force of light or the force of darkness which as usual seems a lot sexier. Her trampy but hot older sister Ridley (Emmy Rossum) for instance who comes to town clad in a gawk-inducing dress and a gawk-inducing convertible and instantly locks lips with Ethans best friend Link (Thomas Mann). Shes all evil and stuff. Then theres the question of Lenas long-missing and supremely evil mom Sarafine who may or may not have something to do with the towns Bible-thumping but suspiciously well-dressed busybody Mrs. Lincoln (Emma Thompson stealing every one of her scenes).Theres been some publicity around the fact that Viola Davis would only do this movie if her character were changed from a domestic servant into something else. So she plays Amma the town librarian who also has access to troves of secret caster-oriented lore but still feels as if she were written in to add a smidgen of diversity to what is otherwise a distressingly all-white Southern world where the annual Civil War reenactment has no sense of morality or history. (Yes it resembles parts of the real-world South in that respect but lets not get distracted.) I actually found the unstable electric connection between Lena and Ethan alluring though as stated Im not promising that the movies target audience will feel the same way. ""Beautiful Creatures"" has no explicit sex or nudity but its pretty clear these two arent saving themselves till marriage ""Twilight""-style although Lenas hormonal tides seem to bring torrential rainstorms lightning snow and other hazardous phenomena with them. Furthermore the bittersweet conclusion to their story is mildly surprising and oddly affecting although of course it leaves the door open for multiple sequels. All in all this movie is likelier to be a pop-culture footnote than the cornerstone to a new empire but if youre brave enough to check it out - whether this weekend or in a few months on pay-per-view - you may well echo Emma Thompson in exclaiming ""Well slap my ass and call me Sally"" Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 191073871 Beautiful Creatures offers spirited romance By Colin Covert Star Tribune February 15 2013 -- 1005am John Bramley Dml - Associated Press - Ap This film image released by Warner Bros Pictures shows Thomas Mann left and Emmy Rossum in a scene from ""Beautiful Creatures."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint While its never quite as spellbinding as its witchcraft-themed story line promises ""Beautiful Creatures"" is a welcome addition to the ranks of paranormal teen romance. This is a spirited playfully comic drama ""Twilights"" shrewder funnier stepsister. It conjures a world of Deep South wizardry where the real soul-sapping comes from small-minded prejudice. In this adaptation from a series of novels by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl the idea that conjurers are a threat to decent society is largely far-right bigotry. Its mainly a plot hurdle separating likable bookish Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) from the enchanting new girl in school Lena (Alice Englert). Ethan chafing at the confines of his South Carolina hometown instinctively takes to the enigmatic newcomer. Shes quite literally the girl of his dreams the very image of a beauty he sees in his sleep. Naturally he defends her against school gossips who brand her wealthy reclusive family as devil worshipers. Even when the taunting provokes an inexplicable blowout of their classrooms windows Ethan is more concerned with Lenas feelings than their classmates minor lacerations. Shes reluctant to respond fending off his attentions with a sassy sense of humor that complements his flirtatious silliness. They share a taste for banned books (Vonnegut and Bukowski must be up there smiling at the plugs the film sends their way) and see the small-town cranks and Civil War re-enactors who consider themselves ""normal"" to be nutty as pecan pie. Lena faces an identity crisis of her own however. When she turns 16 her true nature as a good or evil ""caster"" will come to light making her romance with sweet mortal Ethan an iffy proposition. Director Richard LaGravenese who earned an Oscar nomination for scripting ""The Fisher King"" tosses around a number of interesting ideas that are never fully developed. As a character piece however the movie is an appealing romp. Emma Thompson makes a feast of her role as a prudish churchwoman with a decidedly deranged facet or two. Jeremy Irons brings an agreeably camp attitude to his work as Lenas odd elegant uncle and as Lenas sexy cousin Ridley Emmy Rossum raises the room temperature in every scene she visits. She also adds a dash of romantic rivalry forcing her unwelcome attentions on Ehrenreich who is charming as an innocent among eccentrics. LaGravenese wisely uses the supernatural hokum for anarchic humor. Theres a fine dinner-table spat where Ridley and Lena send the room spinning like a mad merry-go-round (havent we all been there?) and the notion of the overbearing adults in a kids life being genuinely demonic has a certain snap. The narrative has several momentum-stealing hiccups as Civil War memories from past lives flash back and theres a feeling of uneasy truce between the teen romance and adult atmosphere but for all its reliance on genre conventions this is one of the more refreshing films in many weeks. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures John Bramley) Teen-witch movie Beautiful Creatures lacks magic By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Feb 13 2013 (...) John Bramley Alden Ehrenreich (left) and Alice Englert in ""Beautiful Creatures."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures John Bramley) According to the new movie ""Beautiful Creatures"" a sinister subculture is lurking in our small towns. They may look like ordinary mortals they may be upstanding citizens or popular kids at the high school but secretly they are ... readersThe scourge of Gatlin S.C. is Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) a star athlete who keeps copies of Kurt Vonnegut novels under his pillow wishes the town had a Starbucks and dreams of moving to New York City. He also dreams of a mysterious beauty who arrives in the person of transfer student Lena (Alice Englert). When he notices she is reading a book by skid-row poet Charles Bukowski he realizes they are soul mates.But there is another diabolical subculture that is plotting against them thespians Apparently the plantations of the South are crawling with distinguished British actors. Lenas uncle is Oscar winner Jeremy Irons disguised as small-town tycoon Macon Ravenwood. He has brought Lena to his modernist manse to protect her from Sarafine (Oscar winner Emma Thompson) a powerful witch who wants to claim Lenas soul for the dark side. Lenas Sweet 16 party coincides with the towns annual Civil War re-enactment. Lena and her creepy kin know that during the original battle a witch ancestor summoned a curse by saving her mortal lover. So Lena spends the countdown to her birthday researching reversal spells at the city library with the help of seer Amma (Oscar nominee Viola Davis).With so many award-worthy people in the cast and crew including director Richard LaGravenese (screenwriter of ""The Fisher King"") its a wonder that ""Beautiful Creatures"" is so tame. A big part of the problem is the young lovers particularly Ehrenreich as Ethan who is more of a buffoon than a beatnik. Englert is relatively likable as Lena (and notably less mopey than Kristen Stewart in the ""Twilight"" movies) but the derivative script and skimpy effects dont convey either the power or the problems of being a young witch.The stage-trained veterans in the supporting cast might say that this potential franchise needs to double down on toil and trouble.What ""Beautiful Creatures""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 204  Content Mild peril and supernatural themes Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

As Dorothy Parker used to say ""What fresh hell is this?"" Goodbye Harry Potter and the flying broomsticks at Hogwarts. Hello lovesick witches in South Carolina. Desperately seeking the next idiotic supernatural teenage box-office bonanza to replace the hormonally challenged vampires and oversexed werewolves of the Twilight series writer-director Richard LaGravenese has dragged out of mothballs Beautiful Creatures the corny combo of Satanism and Valentines Day by Margaret Stohl and Kami Garcia. Its cult precedes it so writing about it is little more than a formality. This is the kind of movie that can only be reviewed by a 14-year-old critic chewing gum. Gatling South Carolina has 12 churches and not a single Starbucks. Living a life standing still is Ethan Wate (promising newcomer Alden Ehrenreich) a bright imaginative 17-year-old high school kid who dreams of college as an escape from a one-horse town where even The Catcher in the Rye is locked in the library on the condemned reading list. He also dreams about a mysterious Lorelei who lures him into recurring nightmares in the middle of a Civil War battlefield. One day she actually walks into his class--a new girl in town named Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) who lives with her uncle Macon Ravenwood (where do they come up with these names?) in a decaying old mansion with a reputation as a haunted house. In fact the born-again Christians in town are all convinced Lena and her family are ""casters"" or Satan worshipers. This gives the teenage bitches a chance to say things like ""She looks like Death eatin a cracker."" Ethan doesnt care. The minute Lena narrows her eyes and blows the glass windows out of the school hes in love. Ignoring the advice of anyone who ever saw Bette Midler in Hocus Pocus he hikes over to Ravenwood Manor. Outside its a decaying old mansion covered with vines. Then the door creaks open to reveal a fabulous black-and-white set from an old Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical. Lenas Uncle Macon turns out to be Jeremy Irons wearing a floor-length waistcoat over white silk Oriental pajamas like Liberace. (Cliches overwhelm theres even a grand piano with a candelabra.) Eventually Ethan meets the whole family--Lenas long-dead mother Sarafine who takes the form of the towns most bigoted dowager (Emma Thompson) the creepy grandmother (Eileen Atkins) the bulbous aunt (Margo Martindale) and Lenas evil cousin Ridley from the Dark Side (Emmy Rossum) who drives a flashy red convertible and sleeps around with fatal results. Pity the poor highway cop who tries to give her a speeding ticket. Theyre all preparing for Lenas 16th birthday when it will be decided whether she turns into a dark witch or a good witch. The only person who can save her and break the curse is Ethan but it is written in the secret book with the invisible writing that a human cannot love a caster. Did I fail to mention it all happens during the towns annual Civil War picnic? Myriad questions abound. Mainly why doesnt anybody wonder why all the people at Ravenwood Manor have British accents? The best performance in Beautiful Creatures is by the rangy talented Mr. Ehrenreich who is really going places as an actor. A coven of good actors exemplifies the movie motto ""Slumming Can Be Fun""--except for Jeremy Irons who is so overwrought and campy he seems to be on an overdose of Boris Karloff. The movie doesnt know if its a teen fantasy-romance or a more sophisticated satire that the material cant support. The funniest thing in the movie is when the witches confess they used to live in Washington D.C. until they were banished by Nancy Reagan--the only mortal they were afraid of. More laughs are expected in the next two installments of what threatens to become a trilogy. Its early but Im already making plans to be out of town. rreedobserver.com BEAUTIFUL CREATURES Running Time 123 minutes Written by Richard LaGravenese (screenplay) Kami Garcia (novel) and Margaret Stohl (novel) Directed by Richard LaGravenese Starring Alice Englert Viola Davis and Emma Thompson Comment Filed under beautiful creatures Emmy Rossum Harry Potter movie Rex Reed richard lagravenese Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2013/02/whack-magic-in-beautiful-creatures-an-antiquated-narrative-casts-a-tired-spell/,200,beautifulcreatures(2013)28,beautifulcreatures(2013),com/2013/02/whack-magic-in-beautiful-creatures-an-antiquated-narrative-casts-a-tired-spell/

Since boring Bella developed the hots for Edward weve had girl-meets-vampire and girl-meets-zombie. This latest spin based on a bestselling young adult novel is boy-meets-witch. Its a trashy Southern-fried Twilight sticky and slathered in artificial-flavourings which leave you with a not-quite-right feeling. Alice Englert (shes director Jane Campions daughter) plays Lena the pale and interesting new kid in a bible-loving Deep South town. The mean girls at school have got the knives out for Lena whose creepy uncle Macon (Jeremy Irons) has a reputation locally for being a satanist. Which for once isnt hicksville gossip. The family are witches (except were not supposed to call them that; they prefer the term caster). Theres a decent twist here on her sixteenth birthday Lena will be claimed by the good or the bad (its a caster thing). So was her Carrie freakout in class down to regular teen-witch hormones? Or a telltale sign that Lena is going to the dark side? And yes theres a boy involved Ethan played by young Jack Nicholson lookalike Alden Ehrenreich. You see what theyre doing here - wrapping teenage am-I-normal angst into a supernatural love story. Twilight perfected that but this isnt in the same league. There are some funny lines. When uncle Macon asks Lena to play something on the piano she answers in a sarky voice No this is not a Jane Austen novel. Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson both playing witches ham it up outrageously as only Oscar winners can. But where Twilight claimed teenagers (and ex teenagers) hearts by playing it deadly serious with its sweet adolescent earnestness this is campy and overcooked boringly piling on special effects.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE Emmy Rossum plays one of the aesthetically pleasing witches in Beautiful Creatures (John Bramley) B- Beautiful Creatures Genre Drama; Starring Jeremy Irons Emmy Rossum Emma Thompson Viola Davis; Director Richard LaGravenese; Release Date Wide 02/14/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 123; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted February 28 2013 -- 1200 AM EST Beautiful Creatures is arriving in a marketplace full of Twilight junkies still eager for their supernatural teen-romantic fix and the films concept couldnt be clearer Its Twilight with the sexes reversed. This time its the boy whos the mortal moody bookish Ethan the outsider in his sleepy small town of Gatlin S.C. though Alden Ehrenreich plays him more like a sensitive jock on Glee. Lena (Alice Englert) the new girl at school comes from a family of witches (or as theyre known here Casters) and on the day she turns 16 shell be ""claimed"" either by the light side or (more likely due to a family curse) the dark side. Adapted from the popular YA novel by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl Beautiful Creatures is lushly pictorial and not-too-badly acted. The best thing in the movie is Englert who has a fresh unretouched Jane Austen-gone-goth allure. (She is also Jane Campions daughter.) Jeremy Irons as Lenas smoking-jacketed rotter-aristocrat uncle and Emma Thompson as her floridly angry mother are like blithe spirits out of a Dark Shadows sequel you want to see. But Beautiful Creatures more than the Twilight films lacks danger and momentum. The audience like Ethan spends way too much time waiting around for Lena to learn whether shes a good girl or a bad girl.

"Beautiful Creatures 4 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Beautiful Creatures 4 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Beautiful Creatures Good 4 stars Director Richard LaGravenese. Cast Alden Ehrenreich Alice Englert Jeremy Irons Emma Thompson Viola Davis. Rating PG-13 for violence scary images and some sexual material. By Kerry Lengel The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Feb 13 2013 211 PM ""Beautiful Creatures"" is ""Harry Potter"" for the goth-girl set a smart and sexy supernatural romance that unlike ""Twilight"" puts feminine power at the center of the story and -- even better -- doesnt take itself too seriously. Adapted from the 2009 novel by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl (who already have turned out three more titles in the series) the movie version gets some A-list gravitas from Jeremy Irons Viola Davis and Emma Thompson but the starring roles in this spin on forbidden love go to a pair of fresh-faced up-and-comers. Alden Ehrenreich plays Ethan Wate a high-school junior counting down to the day he can leave the fictional town of Gatlin S.C. Hes not exactly an outcast but he prefers the company of Kurt Vonnegut and William S. Burroughs to that of his narrow-minded peers. That is until the arrival of the mysterious raven-haired Lena Duchannes literally the girl of his recent dreams. Lena played by Alice Englert daughter of the Oscar-winning Kiwi director Jane Campion is a caster (the word ""witch"" is pejorative she explains like calling an athlete a ""jock""). She also is approaching her 16th birthday when female casters are ""claimed"" by the Light or the Dark which spells trouble for her budding romance and possibly for the entire world. Lenas Uncle Macon (Irons) -- a dapper droll Southern gentleman who lives in a mansion that looks like a casualty of Shermans march on the outside but an Architectural Digest photo shoot inside -- is fighting to keeping Lena on the right side of the cosmic divide. Meanwhile long-lost mom Sarafine (Thompson in a deliciously devious double role) is scheming to ensure the opposite outcome along with cousin Ridley (Emmy Rossum) a smokin-hot Siren in a red convertible. Davis shows up as the town librarian and a Seer who helps the younguns solve a magical mystery dating back to the Civil War. None of this adds up to an extreme makeover of the paranormal-romance genre but ""Beautiful Creatures"" rises above the rabble thanks to an eminently watchable cast and a sharp screenplay by writer-director Richard LaGravenese (""Living Out Loud""). He displays a refreshingly old-fashioned patience with exposition slowly developing the characters and unveiling the fantastical milieu so that by the time you end up in a Hogwartsian underworld complete with leatherbound spell books and gothic statuary youre having too much fun to not buy in. As the handsome but bookish Ethan what Ehrenreich lacks in Edward-vs.-Jacob pheromone power he makes up for in wry humor Southern charm and dogged loyalty. Although Ethan serves as the films narrator he also is willing to play second fiddle to the storys true protagonist the 15-year-old with the fate of the world on her shoulders. ""Beautiful Creatures"" is a fantasy that reverses some traditional gender roles without necessarily bowing to feminist orthodoxy. The idea that female casters are ""claimed"" for good or evil while the men have a choice is troubling but also intriguing. Empowerment and powerlessness become entangled in a coming-of-age myth that could prove appealing to young women for many sequels to come.

"Beautiful Creatures | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; beautiful-creatures ) Beautiful Creatures (United States 2013) February 13 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Beautiful Creatures is the latest attempt by a Hollywood studio to cash in on the popularity of a YA (Young Adult) series. In this case instead of vampires and werewolves its witches and warlocks. When it comes to romance and interpersonal interaction Beautiful Creatures is on solid ground with director/adaptor Richard Lagravenese crafting a well-worded voiceover and offering his young leads dialogue that pops and crackles. Unfortunately the supernatural goings-on in the fictional town of Gatlin South Carolina arent as effective. The epic battles between light and dark Casters (the non-pejorative term for ""witches"") underwhelms seeming obligatory and derivative. The conclusion is somewhat muddled and despite attempts to provide a satisfactory stopping point its obvious Beautiful Creatures is intended as the first chapter in a longer saga. Novelists Kami Garcia amp; Margaret Stohl wrote four volumes; only a poor showing at the box office will prevent the movie series from churning out at least several sequels. The decision to cast relative unknowns Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert as Ethan and Lena marks an awareness on Warner Brothers part that when it comes to a saga that could have multiple episodes its best to start out with actors who come with a cheaper price tag. As Twilight and The Hunger Games have proven significant salary increases accompany box office success. Ehrenrich and Englert are both very good and possess the key element that any YA romance needs chemistry. Beautiful Creatures best scenes by far are the ones that depict Ethan and Lena falling in love. The exchanges between the two especially early in the film are sharp and smart. Recognizable stars fill supporting roles Jeremy Irons as Lenas uncle Macon Ravenwood; Emma Thompson as Mrs. Lincoln the religious zealot; Viola Davis as Amma Ethans housekeeper; and Eileen Atkins as Lenas grandmother. Beautiful Creatures starts out strongly but loses steam as it progresses. When things become more narrative-driven the appeal of the well-constructed interpersonal relationships and gothic atmosphere moves from foreground to background. The central story relates to a cosmic choice that faces Lena. On her sixteenth birthday her true nature whether dark or light will emerge. Her uncle and many other members of her family are trying to shepherd her to the light while her mother and cousin are advocating that she embrace the dark side. Theres also a curse involved and Ethan as a mortal is a most unwelcome fly in the ointment. Lenas passion for him makes him a target. The romance is developed with a less generous heaping of cheese than the one in Twilight and thats part of the reason why Beautiful Creatures is likely to result in minimal eye rolling for non-devotees. The movie also isnt as coy and conflicted about sex. Do Lena and Ethan do the deed? What happens just off screen beneath a burning sign would argue strongly in favor of a ""yes."" The old Hays Code (like current parents of tweens) would approve of such restraint. The dark Caster/light Caster choice/struggle didnt exactly bore me but its so familiar that it seems to be running on autopilot. Its The Force by another name repackaged for an audience that skews female and probably doesnt care much about Star Wars. (Not that Im arguing The Force was original in its time either.) All of Beautiful Creatures tension is related in one way or another to Lenas relationship with Ethan. The film occasionally skates close to doing one or two edgy things but never commits to them. A lot of what happens near the end especially as it relates to the curse is accomplished with smoke and mirrors. It leaves a bit of a bad taste. The biggest problem Beautiful Creatures may ultimately face is a lack of fervor among movie-goers. Twilight and The Hunger Games both energized a sizeable fan base; the same thing doesnt seem to be happening with Beautiful Creatures and the film isnt strong enough to draw in a large group of those who arent fans beforehand. Richard LaGravenese has a solid pedigree (he was nominated for an Oscar as the writer of The Fisher King) but his script is likely to play to the converted and while thats fine for YA titans its less certain for a lower profile title. The weaknesses of Beautiful Creatures ultimately outweigh the strengths but the conviction of the central relationship is good enough to keep things from becoming laughably bad even if it all comes apart toward the end.

Pictures John Bramley) / APShare Photo The genders have been reversed but the supernatural star-crossed teen angst remains firmly intact in ""Beautiful Creatures"" which clearly aims to pick up where the ""Twilight"" franchise left off. Writer-director Richard LaGraveneses film based on the first novel in the young adult series by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl oozes Southern Gothic eccentricity and some amusing if inconsistent touches of camp. (A droll drawling Jeremy Irons sitting at the piano playing Chopin? Margo Martindale in a feathery hairclip carrying a live peacock? Yes and yes please.) But a strong cast of likable and yes beautiful actors can only do so much with the formula in which theyre forced to work. And like the ""Twilight"" movies the special effects are all-too often distractingly cheesy. The setup breathes some new life into such familiar material though as co-stars Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert feel like actual awkward teens enjoying the fraught thrills of first love rather than slick ironic kids who are too cool. Their first meeting on a two-lane road during a downpour has all the trappings of a romance novel but its also an early indication of the lively chemistry they share. Once the plot machinations start grinding in the second half though ""Beautiful Creatures"" as a whole grinds to a halt. Spells and scenery-chewing can be a hoot; watching other people sitting around scouring ancient tomes for clues not so much. Ehrenreichs character 17-year-old Ethan Wate grew up in the suffocating small town of Gatlin S.C. and is dying to get out. He rebels against the local conservatism by reading all the banned books he can get his hands on from ""Slaughterhouse Five"" to ""Tropic of Cancer"" and as he enters his junior year in high school all he can think about is how far away he can go to college. But the arrival of the mysterious and equally restless Lena Duchannes (Englert) makes Gatlin suddenly tolerable. Shes come to live with her uncle Macon Ravenwood (Irons) a descendant of the towns founders and an alleged Satanist who never leaves the moss-covered and heavily gated Ravenwood Manor. The popular Bible-thumping socialites instantly hate her so naturally Ethan is intrigued - and the fact that Lena introduces him to Bukoswki only makes her more exciting. It turns out that Lena is - duh duh-duh-duh - a witch or rather a ""caster"" as her kind are called in the vernacular. And at a ritual on her 16th birthday shell find out whether shes destined for goodness or evil. Her attempts at functioning as a normal girlfriend until then full of stolen kisses and Friday night movie dates bring a sweetness and relatability to these wild proceedings. Eventually though - as in the ""Twilight"" movies - ""Beautiful Creatures"" introduces more and more supporting characters to add to the denseness of the complicated overly explained mythology. Emma Thompson feels a bit too shrill in not one but two menacing roles Viola Davis exists solely to provide exposition along with her usual grace and a radiant Emmy Rossum vamps it up with reckless abandon as Lenas sexy cousin who has long since gone to the dark side. Ehrenreich who made such an impression a few years back in Francis Ford Coppolas ""Tetro"" has a goofy charm about him that makes him attractive but also seemingly accessible; when I first saw him I thought he had a young Leonardo DiCaprio thing going but as he gets older he seems to have acquired an impishness in his eyes and smile that are reminiscent of a young Jack Nicholson. And Englert the daughter of acclaimed director Jane Campion has a natural beauty and directness about her that are appealing. She doesnt sparkle in the sun - instead she shines from the inside. And she will again someday with better material. ""Beautiful Creatures"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 for violence scary images and some sexual material. Running time 123 minutes. Two stars out of four. --- Motion Picture Association of America rating definition for PG-13 Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Heres a question you can spit back next time someone complains that our popular culture is top-to-bottom depraved ""Then why are our high-school witches vampires and superheroes so passionate about their abstinence?"" The glitter-pored Twilight hunk and Andrew Garfields Spider-Man have won tween hearts and Hollywood billions by cavalierly refusing to sex up their franchises beauties. Theres always a plot excuse a fear that the act of loving would lead to the beloveds destruction but the real reason is likely Generation Awkwards preference for chaste YA over Anne Rice--and a misconception that the purest love is that which dare not doff its pants.The latest just-say-no hero sulks through the swamps of Beautiful Creatures a winning shot of pop-goth hogwash so overheated that during its run theater owners could set aside a couple rows and cultivate Louisiana passionflower. Here not-quite-mortal witch Lena (Alice Englert) is urged by her family to spurn the love of a non-magical local boy Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) in order to protect him from the usual forces of darkness. The new wrinkle She is staring down her imminent 16th birthday which in the daft mythology worked out by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl whose books all this is based on is the time of ""claiming"" when a female ""caster"" like herself discovers whether the forces of the universe have willed her to serve ""light"" or ""dark."" (Even in an abstinence drama thats surprisingly conservative--that women possessed of extraordinary gifts have a 50/50 shot of being factory-set for evil.)A makeout session between the witch and her boy brings lightning down from the heavens but here our lovers get no lustier than that. The movie hails from a different world than the one that produced Franco Zeffirellis horndog 1968 Romeo and Juliet. Here the young lovers torn apart by their families convince themselves that suffering alone is more romantic than sleeping together. Its a Puritanical twist on the beautiful-outcast fantasy that has held sway over young geekdom ever since X-Men writers first linked pubescence with superpowers.Film Details Beautiful Creatures RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time132 More Info Trailer Its primness aside the movie is terrific fun and much more affecting than Twilight or Supernatural. Savor the candied gloom summoned up by director of photography Philippe Rousselot and production designer Richard Sherman. Director Richard LaGravenese who also adapted the novel lavishes the material with greater wit than its demographic demands and the central love story feels warm-blooded--the air prickles between the leads. I laughed a lot mostly where I was supposed to at Lena and Ethans frisky bookish banter (""Bukowski? Is he any good?"" ""Define good""). At Lenas ripostes to a squad of off-the-rack mean girls (""You must have been the pick of your litter""). And especially when the wholly grown-up-looking Ethan announces in a sketch-comedy Southern accent that hes a high-school junior.As the dandyish patriarch of a caster brood Jeremy Irons purrs and broods with arch magniloquence at one point carping about the ""voluminous backsides"" of small-town South Carolinians as he tickles a Chopin piece out of a grand piano. In dress and affect he could be the host of some long-gone UHF creature feature. Hes matched in featured-player craziness by Emma Thompson who at first seems wasted as a churchy busybody of the sort that went out with The Music Man but soon reveals her own bravura witchiness. The story is overstuffed with curses dream visions spell-driven freakouts voodoo nonsense Confederate ghosts religious crazies secret societies extended witch family and testaments to the power of reading. A Southern sheriff runs his cruiser off the road as all in movies must; the third act turns on a library research project spanning months which is unusual in movies with police-car crashes.Also unusual the movies understanding of just how much books and music matter to the young people who care about books and music. Ethan is introduced with a paperback Slaughterhouse Five; he also favors the Beats and knows most of the words to ""Subterranean Homesick Blues."" Lenas familys creepy home is compared to Boo Radleys but this columned corroded plantation would fit the cover of Absalom Absalom At least its outside could; the foyer my favorite of the films jokes is so grand and modern--tiled in white and black and dominated by a curving stairway to heaven--that it could be a set at the Metropolitan Opera.In a movie about two smart kids bucking against a culture that doesnt value them these references are more than just character-defining shorthand. Theyre recommendations presented to the target demo with some urgency worldview-expanding suggestions that could really help soon-to-be-16s not wind up being claimed by darkness. Their spirit informs the one scene here that achieves something like horror. Ethan in a magic stupor stirred by the Jeremy Irons character is called upon to describe what his life will be like after high school. Ehrenreich narrates the vision with dead-eyed clarity marry a girl he likes just enough land a job thats not much better have a couple kids then lose all of the above from drinking too much and carrying on with a friend of the wifes. The movie might be Young Adult compared with its own reading list but for this one heartsick moment it has the fuck-the-rules vitality of Heathers Say Anything or The Graduate. Thats not bad for a movie engineered to teach the parent-approved lesson of the contemporary hero that with great power comes great chastity.

Once these conjurers hit age 16 they are claimed by the ""Light"" or the ""Dark"" which causes some issues between Lena and her mortal inamorato Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich) who narrates this mystical romance with cornpone insouciance. As with many young-adult book-to-film series Beautiful Creatures plays like an illustrated compendium of scenes from the novel as opposed to a finely tuned narrative all its own. LaGraveneses few good ideas like a running gag involving Leonardo DiCaprio movies or the stunning reveal of the interior of Lenas decrepit abode cant make up for the perfunctorily portentous nature of the storytelling. (Supernatural power as metaphor for adolescent travails has about run its thematic course.) And while Ehrenreich and Englert have a pleasing chemistry the rest of the cast--notably Emma Thompsons Southern-fried necromancer--are instead given free rein to cash their paychecks while slicing the ham cringingly thick. But hey this is still leagues beyond The Golden Compass.

No doubt designed to follow in the human-supernatural-romance footsteps of ""Twilight"" this new film similarly allows fans of the books (in this case by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl) to take the proceedings seriously while allowing civilians to chuckle at the delicious excess of it all. Writer-director Richard LaGravenese makes the love story smart sweet and believable while letting things go crazy once the films witches (or ""casters"" as they prefer to be called) start throwing their powers around. Our hero Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) longs to flee his hometown of sleepy Gatlin S.C. a town he says people are either too dumb or too stuck to ever escape. He consumes banned books like ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" and ""Tropic of Cancer"" and plots his eventual departure after high school. At the beginning of his junior year his school gets an all-too-rare new face Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) who has moved into the creepy Ravenwood mansion with her uncle the reclusive Macon Ravenwood (Jeremy Irons). Ethan and Lena fall for each other but their courtship is more prickly than swoony involving a shared love of forbidden literature. (She turns him on to Bukowski -- and this is one of those rare movies where characters who bond over books actually appear to have read them.) Macon objects to their relationship because Lena is a caster and on her upcoming 16th birthday her nature will determine whether she will use her powers for the light or for the dark. Hoping for the latter are her cousin Ridley (Emmy Rossum sporting a series of Jeffrey Kurland-designed costumes that will inspire the next several seasons of ""RuPauls Drag Race"") and her estranged mother Sarafine whos currently occupying the body of local religious busybody Mrs. Lincoln (Emma Thompson). Weve pretty much seen this all before from the star-crossed lovers (even ""Warm Bodies"" wears its ""Romeo and Juliet"" roots on its undead sleeves) to the lessons about determining your own path in life (Lenas choice makes her the Teen Vogue version of the Iron Giant) but LaGravenese imbues the material with a giddy adrenaline that overpowers any feeling of familiarity. It helps that hes got such a strong ensemble of actors from relative newcomers Englert (the daughter of director Jane Campion) and Ehrenreich to a deep roster of character actors including Eileen Atkins Viola Davis Kyle Gallner Thomas Mann and Pruitt Taylor Vince. (To paraphrase Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Django Unchained"" When Margo Martindale turns up in a movie you have my curiosity. When Margo Martindale turns up in a movie holding a live peacock you have my attention.) If you can get past this movies terrible trailer (not to mention post-""Twilight"" fatigue) you may find yourself giving into the scenery-chewing weather-manipulating treats of this wild ride. That ""Beautiful Creatures"" can offer both sumptuous silliness and a teen couple whose relationship actually matters is its own particular brand of magic. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Pictures Well-made hokum about ill-advised teen love across a species divide. TWITTER Opening Valentines Day this supernatural teenage love story is designed to ensnare bereft ""Twilight"" fans. Plainly conceived to ensnare teenage viewers who just dont know what to do with themselves now that the Twilight series is history Beautiful Creatures will serve as an adequate if less exotic substitute. Based on the first of four Caster Chronicles novels by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl published in 2009 the story merely flip-flops the sexes as a small-town high school boy becomes enamored of a girl with strong family ties to the dark side. Nicely cast and made with as much conviction as can be brought to something so intrinsically formulaic this Warner Bros. release has an large and eager built-in fan base that will pack theaters with gobs of girls and more than a few boys upon its Valentines Day opening with people on both sides naturally hoping that this is the start of something big franchise-wise. Told at least at first from the point of view of the boy Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich) this is literally the story of a dream of his come true -- a recurring dream of a young woman partly obscured from view on a Civil War battlefield but one in which Ethan always ends up getting hit by lightning. Thats pretty much what Ethan feels like is happening to him when a dark-haired beauty Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) arrives at school and gives him something to think about other than applying to college. No doubt with the target audience in mind Ethan whose mother has died and whose father is never seen has been matured slightly here from the books high school sophomore to a 17-year-old with college on his mind. Anxious to escape from stifling religion-bound Gatlin S.C. where even To Kill a Mockingbird is banned from the school Ethans devouring Henry Miller Ayn Rand and Kurt Vonnegut and is turned on to Charles Bukowski by Lena whose initial frostiness quickly melts when it becomes clear Ethan might become her only ally in a school where the prim Bible-bound conservatives think shes a Satanist. Its actually a bit more complicated than that. Every story like this needs to invent a mythology intriguing enough to sucker you in and this one has its roots at Ravenwood Manor a spooky nearby mansion where recluse Macon Ravenwood (Jeremy Irons) heir to the towns founding family and still owner of much of the town hides himself away. Ethan has the guts to sneak in for a look is greeted in courtly fashion by the elegant Southern gent and soon gets the lowdown Lena should not become close to Ethan because shes a Caster already endowed with the power to harness the elements (she brings the windows of her classroom crashing in on her silly schoolmates). Upon her upcoming 16th birthday she will be subjected to the Claiming which will determine whether she is ""claimed"" by the Light or the Dark. Macon who tries to keep his Dark proclivities in check hopes to prevent his niece from inheriting a similar fate though its never actually stated what the difference would be between having Light and Dark powers (presumably the former are too boring for words not to mention teen fiction). Understandably nervous about her looming birthday Lena also wants to experience something akin to a normal adolescence and opens herself to a romance with the ever-enthusiastic Ethan whos happy to oblige and remains largely oblivious to the land mines that lie ahead in their relationship. Turning up to promote the Dark cause are two Sirens Ridley (Emmy Rossum) a wild thing who rolls into town in a red-hot BMW convertible and since turning 16 has never met anyone she didnt want to corrupt and Sarafine (Emma Thompson) another Dark Caster who isnt going to make it any easier for Macon to keep Lena in line until her birthday. Both actresses clearly relish whooping it up as bad girls and Thompson has the double pleasure of also playing Gatlins uptight guardian of morality Mrs. Lincoln whos also the mother of Ethan best friend Link (Thomas Mann). The central thrust of the story is a teenage girls anxiety and troubled contemplation of imminent womanhood which in Lenas case has a fixed date and implications beyond the concerns of her peers. Shes constrained from revealing her true nature but because Ethan is uncomplicated and entirely optimistic about the future she can at least momentarily enjoy the illusion of first love and a normal adolescence. Writer-director Richard LaGravenese instantly gets the audience on the side of his young protagonists by creating a sympathetic us-against-the-world bond in which hardly anyone else even including Ethan can possibly understand the crisis at hand. One character who helps clarify the issue is Amma (Viola Davis) the local librarian who also helps look after Ethan and knows more about local history and its current implications than anyone but Macon. But Ethan can only imagine rising above the limitations fate prescribes and Ehrenreich (Tetro Twixt Stoker) has an openness and enthusiasm that makes his conviction credible enough. Still a few glancing moments of greater seriousness from him would have been welcome if only to enable Ethan to engage with the gravity given off by Englert. As she does in Ginger and Rosa this young actress (the daughter of director Jane Campion) projects a maturity and self-possession beyond her years. This benefits her performance as a troubled girl with lots on her mind but also puts Lena on a level that would challenge the empathy and psychological acuity of even the most mature man making you wonder at times how Ethans insistent encouragement alone will be enough to help her through her rite of passage. Rossum barnstorms through her role in a way that ensures you watch her and only her whenever shes onscreen while the more grown-up performers effortlessly provide what they were paid to deliver class. The visual effects also are up to par but the more abundant they become the more they make Beautiful Creatures look and feel like so many other films of its type a concoction that makes highly calculated use of fantasy fates taboos young love and visual hocus-pocus to ensnare an audience in a narrative web thats pretty darn ridiculous.

Southern goth-chic gets a swoony supernatural makeover in ""Beautiful Creatures"" a teen franchise-starter that suggests what ""Twilight"" might have looked like with a reasonable budget a competent script and halfway-decent special effects but still saddled with next-best source material. Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohls book the first of four reps a calculated synthesis of proven YA-lit elements and recent publishing success tactics which makes for ingratiating storytelling on the page. Fortunately writer-director Richard LaGravenese has jettisoned most of the novel and refashioned its core mythology and characters into a feverishly enjoyable guilty pleasure unapologetic in its mass-market rebel tude. Though ""Beautiful Creatures"" has what it takes to support a series -- a ""gifted"" girl a smitten guy and powerful evil forces determined to keep them apart -- the film could face trouble winning over cynical young auds who view it as the latest shameless attempt to cash in on the fantasy craze which of course it is. And yet now that the ""Twilight"" and Harry Potter series have run their course the timing seems right for a soapy romance in which a sensitive small-town hunk (Alden Ehrenreich) falls hard for the new girl in town not really minding that shes a witch -- or ""caster"" as they prefer to be called here. With a dark-haired pale-skinned look more likely to inspire 1920s audiences than todays supermodel-obsessed tastes Alice Englert (""Ginger and Rosa"") brings a refreshingly relatable quality to the role of 15-year-old Lena Duchannes whos moved to dead-end Gatlin S.C. after things got out of control at her last school. Lena wants to keep a low profile while counting down the days until her 16th birthday when a family curse predicts she will be ""claimed"" as a dark witch but Ethan recognizes her as the mysterious girl hes been dreaming about for months and insists on getting to know this melancholy stranger. The best young-adult offerings tap into deeper themes that resonate with teens but this one trades mostly in dopey wish fulfillment granting magical powers and a devoted admirer to girls who imagine themselves as outsiders. Its about feeling different having a secret and discovering that special soulmate in whom one can confide. With his heavy brow knit in an expression of deep concern Ehrenreich looks the way a young Orson Welles might if cast on a CW series with a plucky Southern accent in place of a sonorous radio voice. Though the film preserves the idea of Ethan as narrator it ditches the novels off-puttingly snide tone allowing the popular girls -- led by self-righteous ex-g.f. Emily (Zoey Deutch) -- to damn themselves while saving the amusing putdowns for Gatlin. Nearly everything about the book has been streamlined for the screen which may rankle fans (who are likely to miss the ethereal song that binds Ethan to Lena at least) but it makes for a far cleaner plot. While Lena spices up a traditional teen courtship with doses of magic -- as when she caps a date by conjuring snow out of thin air on a muggy December afternoon -- her powerful dark relatives (a vampy cousin played by Emmy Rossum and shape-shifting undead mom Sarafine played with lip-smacking relish by Emma Thompson) arrive to demonstrate what happens when witches go bad. The film goes out of its way to forge memorable character introductions which will serve the series well should sequels follow (more confusing is a scene toward the end when Ethan a sophomore in the book is shown leaving for NYU). By granting LaGravenese the freedom to refashion the novel as he sees fit Warner Bros. gives ""Beautiful Creatures"" an edge over other recent hit fantasy-series adaptations which have often shown stiff gospel-like fidelity to their source material. By contrast this project comes across as downright blasphemous -- and not only against the potboiler that inspired it; LaGraveneses script takes on Bible-beaters book-banners and all who invoke God to justify small-minded prejudice. In one particularly campy scene Sarafine goes head-to-head with Lenas guardian (Jeremy Irons the picture of drawling Old South gentility) in the local church dabbing holy water behind her ears like perfume as she dismisses the superstitious townsfolks notions of religion. Considering how little it takes to get certain groups riled up about what their kids are reading the film goes awfully far out of its way to align itself with blacklisted literature offering up Viola Davis voodoo ""seer"" (and resident librarian) as its high priestess. Garcia and Stohl clearly saw ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""Catcher in the Rye"" as models for the series although ""Beautiful Creatures"" demonstrates few of their insights into human nature hewing closer to Judy Blume and ""Twilight"" fan fiction. Likewise while Ethan and Lena turn one another onto Vonnegut and Bukowski throwing their names around for punk credibility either writer would surely recoil to see himself quoted in this context. The film ultimately plays like so much teenage girl poetry heavy on the angst endearingly naive in its notions of love and yet brought vividly to life by a game cast evocative locations (both indoors and out) and stunning anamorphic lensing. Louisiana works nicely for Civil War-obsessed Gatlin suggesting a tween-friendly ""True Blood.""

(Photo John Bramley/Courtesy of Warner Bros Pictures) Richard Lagraveneses adaptation of the YA supernatural romance novel Beautiful Creatures is deliciously overripe; it plays like Twilight with a fat dose of Bell Book and Candle (or its high-camp TV analog Bewitched). In the role of Ethan Wate the mortal hero Alden Ehrenreich is a fascinating hybrid; he has Leo DiCaprios heavy brow and Jack Nicholsons vaulting brows as if the stars had mated on the set of The Departed. This lovelorn joker reads Slaughterhouse-Five Tropic of Cancer and other banned books that elicit murmurs of disapproval in a rural South Carolina high school full of Bible-bearing cheerleaders. Then one day a dark-haired girl Lena Duchannes (rhymes with rain) arrives reading wait for it Charles Bukowski. Instantly you intuit the couples destiny love marriage rehab. In the book by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl Ethan and Lenas first car ride is awkward and not particularly auspicious. LaGravenese turns it into a screwball volley that would make Preston Sturges tip his yachting cap. He asks if Bukowski is good and she says Define good. The encounter ends when Lena fends off Ethans request to see the inside of her uncles antebellum manse Ravenwood I dont feel like being the haunted-house attraction today. But Ethan has a thing for haunted houses. He has visions of a woman wailing and raging on a hillside amid a Civil War battle the woman like Lena the manor like Ravenwood. It stands to reason he must bemutatis mutandisthe soldier on the ground with the bullet holes. This is obviously a saga that will span centuries not to mention sequels and prequels. Lena is played by Alice Englert daughter of Aussie art-house darling Jane Campion and a thoughtful self-contained actressshe grows on you. (Also her eyeliner grows on herIm guessing the filmmakers fiddled with her look over the course of shooting.) You dont cast Jane Campions kid if your intentions are lowly (or lowbrow) and LaGravenesewhose excellent rat-a-tat psychodramas include Living Out Loud and the screenplays for The Fisher King and The Refis all in. Englert and Ehrenreich dont just stare dopily at each other practicing Mormon forbearance. Theyre grabbyand gabby. They talk about like ideas. The most worrisome thing is Lenas temper which manifests itself like lightning strikes and rain showers focused exclusively on one person. Indeed the grown-ups know that if these kids get together seriously something very bad will happeneither now or in the sequels and prequels. Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson play casters (i.e. spell-casters) dueling over Lenas fate. Macon Ravenwood (Lenas uncle) is icy sallow thin-lipped every line withering into a sardonic sigh. Sarafine Duchannes is cackling hooting high on the hogand since Sarafine uses the body of Ethans best friends prim mother Thompson gets to overact in two distinct styles. The pair face off in a church. At issue is the point in a casters lifeit seems to come a short time after the arrival of boobs or pubeswhen a certain curse kicks in and the dark side takes over. Lenas mom went dark. So did Lenas good-girl cousin (Emmy Rossum) who now wears black lace and corsets and makes like Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe. I frankly didnt see the problem vis-a-vis the dishy cousin but the curse will supposedly spell trouble for Ethan and Lena. Perhaps the housekeeping supernatural librarian can advise. Shes played by Viola Davis for whom LaGravenese merged two roles proving prominent black actresses are no longer confined in big-studio pictures to domestics or fortune-tellers for white people. They can play domestics who are also fortune-tellers for white people I enjoyed this piece of southern-fried screwball Gothic whimsy (with jolts of CGI spell-casting for the multiplex crowd) so much that Im sad to admit that its nowhere near as potent as Twilight. Im hardly a Twi-hard I remember my bafflement at New Moon when all those texting teenage girls were suddenly mesmerized by a movie that moved at the speed of a tectonic plate greeting Edward the Ruby-Lipped Effigy and Jacob the Human Muscle Chart with shrieks dissolving into moans and giddy whispers. But writer Stephenie Meyer got hold of something creepy in American (not just Mormon or Catholic) culturewhat happens when waves of erotic longing collide with waves of shame and body horror. Beautiful Creatures isnt pure camptheres some real emotion in there. But not enough to hit you on a primal level. Can a movie in this florid genre pack a wallop if its too cool for Sunday school?
