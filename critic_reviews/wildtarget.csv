Yet its worth seeing (1) for Bill Nighy doing his drop-dead deadpan (2) for Emily Blunt being well Emily Blunt and (3) to see what Ron Weasley is up to when hes not running around with that sorcerer pal battling Voldemort and the nasty Horcruxes.Yes Harry Potters Rupert Grint sporting a scruffy beard and a pack of cigarettes is the third of Wild Targets threesome. Grint is Tony a callow fellow who believes he is apprenticing to be a private detective. Alas his mentor Victor Maynard (Nighy) is actually a professional assassin hired this time to knock off Rose (Blunt) a fetching scam artist who has seriously upset a mobbed-up art collector (Rupert Everett). But Victor cant bring himself to kill Rose - hes not sure why exactly - and so he and she and Tony scamper around being pursued by a posse of hit men.Directed by Jonathan Lynn whose more successful romps include My Cousin Vinny and The Whole Nine Yards (another hit- man comedy) Wild Target is the sort of farce where nothing essentially is at stake even as cars crash (including an original Mini Cooper) bullets rip and knives get hurled with deadly velocity.So the film has to fly by its wits - and its witty lines - and by the charm of its stars.This it does just barely. Writer Lucinda Coxon delivers enough drolleries and a workable running gag or two. Nighy plays dry and (not really) sinister with ease and aplomb while Blunt is seductive and impertinent and appears to be enjoying herself immensely (perhaps too immensely). And Grint is the straight man - which isnt that easy when youre in a bubble bath and just may have been propositioned by a guy.A beefier and bearded Everett and Eileen Atkins - as Victors mother in a rest home (doing a quickie homage to Psycho) - also seem to be having a good time.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

His professional routine is interrupted when he finds himself drawn to one of his intended victims Rose. He spares her life unexpectedly acquiring a young apprentice in the process Tony. Believing Victor to be a private detective his two new companions tag along while he attempts to thwart the murderous attentions of his unhappy client. Starring Bill Nighy Emily Blunt Rupert Grint Rupert Everett Eileen Atkins Martin Freeman Gregor Fisher Graham Seed Stephanie Lammond Philip Battley Director Jonathan Lynn Running time 128 Release Opened Nov 12 2010  Editorial Review On the lam and under the gunBy Michael OSullivanFriday November 12 2010Its never a good idea to cast Bill Nighy as a buttoned-down hit man. Not because of the hit man part - thats pure genius - but the buttoned-down bit. The British actor is at his best when playing people who are at least a little bit raffish and mad. Think of Quentin in ""Pirate Radio"" Davy Jones in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films Billy Mack in ""Love Actually"" Ray Simms in ""Still Crazy."" So although its always a pleasure to see Nighy again his performance as ultra-professional assassin Victor Maynard in the largely breezeless black comedy ""Wild Target"" is a letdown. The film itself boasts a fine supporting cast - Emily Blunt Rupert Grint Eileen Atkins and Rupert Everett - but as the glue holding the whole thing together Nighy would be far better off were he allowed to become a little more . . . unglued. As it is Nighys Victor is a stuffy old bore. At 54 hes an expensive killer with a taste for fine wine and French lessons. As a measure of just how good - and how disengaged - he has become from his work he practices language drills while dispatching his victims. Its a job for him not a joy. But when Victors latest victim Rose (Blunt playing a thief who has ticked off Everetts smarmy mobster) proves a little harder to kill than hes used to Victor somewhat implausibly takes her under his wing along with a young man named Tony (Grint) who has stumbled upon Victor with the gun in his hand. Victor explains it away by saying hes a private detective. Why he doesnt just shoot them both is never adequately explained. So hes gone soft. Whatever. When the mobster hires a second assassin (Martin Freeman) to finish Victors job and kill Victor the three fugitives - Victor Rose and Tony collectively the films titular ""wild"" target - go on the lam. The rest of the movie predictably enough deals with their interpersonal dynamics. Needless to say Victor and the free-spirited Rose who initially claim to hate each other start to exhibit signs of mutual attraction though there is also a rather strange element of flickering homoeroticism between Victor and Tony. Its not the gay subtext thats strange. At this point we just want Victor to be happy. (Would it kill him to smile?) But a 54-year-old man manifesting the hots for a woman half his age or for a young man whos even closer to jailbait? Thats a tiny bit creepy and not in a madcap way. Atkins who plays Victors domineering and slightly unhinged mother is the best thing about ""Wild Target."" Shes the only loose canon on this ship the only unknown variable in the equation. Whenever shes on screen you dont know whats going to happen if only for a minute.Contains comic violence and gunplay sensuality and occasional obscenity.

By Peter Rainer Film critic October 29 2010 Save for later Saved Bill Nighy is shown in a scene from Wild Target. Nick Wall Photography/Freestyle Releasing/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If comedy as the comedians say is not pretty then black comedy is downright ugly. ""Wild Target"" starring Bill Nighy as a repressed hit man and Emily Blunt as the sexy free spirit he cant find it in himself to eradicate is practically a text book in how ugly things can get when you dont have the right light touch for this sort of thing.Nighys Victor was literally raised from the cradle by his hit-man father to follow in the profession. His doting controlling mother (Eileen Atkins) keeps a scrapbook of newspaper clippings of his high-profile hits. All this explains why Victor doesnt have very good people skills. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Director Jonathan Lynn and screenwriter Lucinda Coxon have adapted Pierre Salvadoris ""Cible Emouvante"" which is described in the films production notes as a ""classic French comedy"" - although Ive never heard of it - and perhaps this is the core problem. French farce doesnt mix well with English gooniness. Grade C (Rated PG-13 for violence some sexual content and brief strong language.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test?

"Wild Target review A comedy about assassins thats actually funny |       NJ.com comments Wild Target review A comedy about assassins thats actually funny Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 29 2010 at 747 AM View/Post Comments Nick Wall Photography Billy Nighy (center) is an assassin who falls for a woman played by Emily Blunt (right) in ""Wild Target."" There have been a lot of black comedies about assassins lately -- there have been a few just this year -- but ""Wild Target"" may be the first one to contain genuine laughs. Some of that is due undoubtedly to director Jonathan Lynn whom you can blame for the Steve Martin version of ""Sgt. Bilko"" (and the dullest of the dull Eddie Murphy comedies) but who also started out in Cambridge revues and co-created the great BBC series ""Yes Minister."" Going back to Britain with an all-British cast seems to have helped him purge himself of all those bad broad Hollywood habits. The pace here is fast the silly chases kept to a minimum and the punch lines often occur just slightly out of frame. Some credit too is probably due screenwriter Lucinda Coxon whose background is mostly in theater. (Although its hard to say how much credit; the story and characters come from ""Cible Emouvante"" a 90s French farce that never got an American release.) But there is no doubt that any praise given the cast is richly deserved. Movie Review WILD TARGET (PG-13) FREESTYLE (98 min.) Directed by Jonathan Lynn. With Bill Nighy Emily Blunt Rupert Grint Eileen Atkins Rupert Everett. Now playing in New York. Ratings note The film contains violence drug use and some strong language. Stephen Whittys review THREE STARS British actors have always seemed to have a somewhat healthier relationship to their art than many Americans. It is a calling yes but its also a craft and theyre eager to practice it -- even if the part is small or the project not particularly serious. So thats wonderful Eileen Atkins playing the hitmans mother and madcap Rupert Everett as an art-loving gangster. Even young Rupert Grint -- who really doesnt even need to work thanks to those ""Harry Potter"" checks -- gamely shows up as a not very bright apprentice assassin. Particularly charming are the two stars. As the amateur thief who grabs an Old Master and puts the plot (and plotters) in motion Emily Blunt takes a standard indie-movie type -- the Quirky Girl Who Changes Your Life -- and gives her a charm not evident on the page. And as the aging professional killer whos supposed to eliminate her -- and instead falls for her -- Bill Nighy is once again so coolly charming and elegantly dry you might as well just stick an olive in him and put him in a martini glass. ""Wild Target"" is -- no shock -- not to be taken seriously. (Its a May-December comedy about a mass murderer after all.) And even so sometimes its sillier than it needs to be or just plain sloppy. (At least one characters death is treated far too casually even for a comedy and one villain seems to be forgotten.) But in the end its still a nice sprightly little film with good actors and a lively soundtrack. And at the end of a month of monsters mortality and other horrors thats enough.

Ace British character actor Bill Nighy (""Pirate Radio"") teams up with the ever-delicious Emily Blunt in Jonathan Lynns ""Wild Target"" an eccentric little comic thriller filled with enough laughs that I was mostly willing to overlook the fact that it makes virtually no sense as a thriller. Having great fun playing against his usual wild-and-crazy types Nighy is Victor a middle-aged highly-paid hit man who is such a fussbudget that his own elderly mother (Eileen Atkins) wonders if her never-married son has gay ""tendencies."" Victor has been hired by a real estate mogul Ferguson (Rupert Everett) to take out Rose (Blunt) a glamorous swindler who sold the mogul a fake Rembrandt. The planned assassination in a garage is interrupted by the arrival of a second hit man -- who is shot to death by Tony (Rupert Grint) a not-so-innocent bystander who was burgling cars. For reasons that neither Victor nor Lucinda Coxons script (based on a French film) can adequately explain Victor decides to flee with Rose and Tony to a hotel where their room turns out to be down the hall from Fergusons. The trio improbably decamps to Victors home in the countryside where the furniture has plastic coverings and his invalid mom pops in from the nursing home at opportune moments. At one point its suggested that Victor is sexually attracted to the pot-smoking frequently shirtless Tony -- who doesnt seem to be at all interested in Rose. That idea is quickly dropped though in favor of a more conventional (if equally improbable) romance between Victor and the reckless Rose. There are several well-staged chases and comic set pieces devised by Lynn a Brit who is best-known in this country for ""My Cousin Vinny"" and ""The Whole Nine Yards."" Lynn provides nice change-of-pace roles for Blunt (trapped in period roles in ""The Young Victoria"" and ""The Wolfman"") and Grint who seems to enjoy channeling Jon Heder during this vacation from his decade-long stint as Ron Weasley in the ""Harry Potter"" series. If you are willing to check your brain at the popcorn stand you can have a lot of fun watching ""Wild Target.""

"Crime comedy Wild ultimately misses target - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Bill NighyMOVIES  REVIEW Crime comedy Wild ultimately misses targetThe dominoes are lined up but director Jonathan Lynn cant make them fall.October 29 2010|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC ""Wild Target"" starring Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt is a droll British farce about a middle-aged hit man who falls for a beautiful young mark and as its title suggests everything -- including the movie -- seems destined to spin dangerously out of control.In this re-imagining of Pierre Salvadoris more darkly told 1993 French original ""Cible Emouvante"" there is irony around every curve and swerve of Lucinda Coxons screenplay. Human nature romance family ties the art of the kill honor among thieves and Murphys Law are lined up like dominoes just waiting for a fall.Since irony is so often director Jonathan Lynns weapon of choice ""Wild Target"" should have been a good fit. Its not quite. With the exception of ""My Cousin Vinny"" the filmmaker has spun gold more often on British TV most notably in the 80s with the insolent excellence of ""Yes Minister"" and ""Yes Prime Minister"" (both comedy series created and written with Antony Jay).On the big screen Lynn a Brit who decamped to Los Angeles years ago can flounder (see or not ""The Whole Nine Yards"" ""The Distinguished Gentleman"" or ""Sgt. Bilko""). When he does in ""Wild Target"" the film loses the tension that should accompany all those collapsing dominoes Coxon arranged so nicely.Set in modern-day London and surrounding countryside it all begins when a high-end art heist goes south. Rose (Blunt) is a clever con and in a classic bait-and-switch borrows a Rembrandt so that a forged copy can be pawned off on Ferguson (Rupert Everett) a dapper gangster and obsessive art collector with deep pockets and a nasty temper.The countrys most elusive and expensive assassin Victor Maynard (Nighy) gets the commission to waste the deceitful young lovely. Ah but what a waste.... In one of the films best scenes and the linchpin for all that follows hes completely charmed by Roses remarkable sleight of hand. Blunt is irresistible as she saunters unsuspectingly through a crowded flea market lifting whatever catches her fancy slipping in and out of sight each time Victors silencer is set to do its job.Director of photography David Johnson (""Hilary and Jackie"" ""Resident Evil"") lets the camera linger adoringly as if taken by the unintended seduction as much as Victor is. Where Blunts Rose is all softness and light Nighys Victor is brittle and brisk -- from the precision timing he exhibits in the various shootouts to the plastic-wrapped furniture in his well-appointed but dreary country home.Nighy is usually a treat to watch navigating lifes bad turns so its especially frustrating that the filmmaker so often leaves him at loose ends. Nighy was perhaps never better than in a similar role the excellent 2005 TV drama ""The Girl in the Cafe"" another case of an uptight older man undone by a disastrous flirtation. Here when sparks -- romantic and otherwise -- should fly they fizzle instead.--betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--Wild TargetMPAA rating PG-13 for violence some sexual content and brief strong languageRunning time 1 hour38 minutesPlaying ArcLight Hollywood; Landmark West LA MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement MORE STORIES ABOUTBill NighyAntony JayCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-wild-target-20101029,0,5292379.story",200,wildtarget5,wildtarget,latimes

Thudding flying-bullet complications ensue. The cast though includes a great bunch of Brit faves who have all done better work elsewhere including Eileen Atkins Rupert Everett and Rupert Grint (a.k.a.

I could talk about its absurd plot which has fastidious assassin Victor Maynard--played by Bill Nighy with a center part silly mustache and exasperated air--inexplicably protecting his latest target the wild n wacky con artist Rose (Emily Blunt). I could mention how Rupert Grint plays a pot-smoking dunderhead wrapped up in the whole mess. I figured Id mention that its directed by British legend Jonathan Lynn best known for the BBCs Yes Minister but last seen in movie theaters with er Nuns on the Run. (Before that he directed Clue for which--respect.) How else to get across how haphazard this whole enterprise is? Describe its incompetent action choreography? Mention the lame cameos by Rupert Everett Eileen Atkins and Martin Freeman? Post an Mp3 of the score all honking saxophones and wheezing accordions? And then near the end of the movie there it was Emily Blunt pushed a suitcase out the window of a country house. (Because she saw Victor pull the stuffed parrot--it doesnt matter why) Off-screen I heard the suitcase crash to the patio and then after a beat the yowl of an angry cat. Wild Target is the kind of movie that actually uses that angry-cat-yowl sound. That is the kind of movie that Wild Target is.

A hitman suffering an identity crisis turns bodyguard to protect a femme kleptomaniac in the unlovable seldom funny Brit comedy ""Wild Target."" Nearly every element here is wildly off-target from Jonathan Lynns (""The Whole Nine Yards"") lazy helming and Lucinda Coxons shambolic script to the embarrassed-looking perfs from usually excellent lead thesps Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt. Likely to be shot down by critical attacks and bad word of mouth the pic would be well advised to go to ancillary straight away. Born into a family of pro assassins ace hitman Victor Maynard (Nighy) longs for some kind of life beyond murdering people. When client Ferguson (Rupert Everett) hires Victor to off kooky thief Rose (Blunt) for stealing a Rembrandt from him Victor finds himself unable to finish the job and ends up saving her and witness Tony (Rupert Grint) from subsequent killers. Character motivations make no sense throughout; Victor thinks he may be gay one minute but is falling for Rose the next. Chase sequences are competently handled but then nothing really happens for 40 minutes halfway through. Only Blunts sexy high-fashion wardrobe compels interest -- but only just.

Bill Nighy plays hermetic near silent and sexually confused assassin Victor Maynard who - via a series of unlikely events - must turn protector to brassy kleptomaniac Emily Blunt and pot-bonging naif Rupert Grint. The actors do the best with what theyre given - its just a shame theyve been given so little. The script is free of either zingers or insight the inertia of the story is constantly stalled by deviation (including a superfluous homoerotic vignette which appears to be a cheap excuse to show Grint in the nud) and entire characters - including the baddie of the piece Rupert Everett - are left to fade into the background. Nothing feels like its been properly thought through highlighted by the fact that Nighys super assassin goes about his business by merely opening fire on a crowded market place (using a silencer of course).

A promising cast broadly a good plot but ruined by cringe-worthy moments when everything just fell apart (such as the stilted dialogue in the car park and the awful comedy sound effects in the car chase) and several issues with the plot such as how on earth Rose managed to conceive and bear a four year old child in three years (one assumes she stole it).

A decent remake with excellent performances from everyone especially Nighy perfect as the uptight hitman and Blunt letting her hair down a bit. Pretty entertaining and if they ever make a biopic of Norman Wisdom Martin Freeman should star - he looks eerily like the unfunny 1950s starFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 19 2010ellieFeaturedThe cast did a fantastic job but nothing could really make up for the fact that plot went AWOL leaving loose ends left right and centre. It felt like theyd edited out the reason for Rupert Grint which is a shame as he is potentially a promising performer. It was also diificult to tell which one of the male leads it would be least inapropriate for Emily Blunt to snog... what have these actors done to deserve this? Jut lacked directionFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 16 2010Gene 1FeaturedObviously Mr. Jenkins is just a mean scribble....
