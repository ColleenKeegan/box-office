"Sinister review Mr. Boogie meet scarier Mr. Google | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSinister review Mr. Boogie meet scarier Mr. GoogleMore stupid than scary Sinister cant even figure out who its real demon is.Juliet Rylance left Ethan Hawke right and Michael Hall DAddario in a scene from ""Sinister.""  (Phil Caruso / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 12 2012Sinister (out of 4)Starring Ethan Hawke Juliet Rylance James Ransone Vincent DOnofrio and Fred Thompson. Directed by Scott Derrickson. 110 minutes. Opens Oct. 12 at major theatres. 14AMore stupid than scary Sinister cant even figure out who its real demon is.The bony finger of the skeletal script points to a bogeyman with the oh-so-clever nickname Mr. Boogie who has a yen for mass murder and Super 8 home movies. Id argue the bogeyman it should be is Mr. Google whom Ill get to in a moment.Article Continued BelowMr. Boogie (or ""Bagul"" if you want to get formal) is the pesky demon terrorizing true-crime novelist Ellison Osborne (Ethan Hawke) who foolishly moved his family into a crime scene. Its the rural Pennsylvania home whose previous four occupants died by hanging on the backyard tree a ghastly scene presented in the prologue. A fifth family member a child went missing and remains so. Ellison doesnt bother to reveal the houses horrific past to his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and their two children Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall DAddario). He still doesnt open up when he discovers a cache of Super 8 movies in the attic each of them revealing a family dying from fire water or other catastrophe. He just keeps watching those movies while also guzzling Scotch and making furtive attempts to pound out another best-seller to revive his career which has been on the skids for a decade or more.Its a given that people do dumb things in horror movies such as failing to switch on the lights when they enter a dark room. Ellison does all these things and more. A certain indulgence is required but Sinister writer/director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) and co-writer C. Robert Cargill expect too much.Dumb becomes lazy way too often. How could Tracy possibly not know that shes living in a house o horrors especially since her kids have heard about it at school? Why doesnt Ellison flip when he discovers a scorpion and a poisonous snake in his attic? Why does he need glasses but takes them off to peer into the darkness?Most important of all why doesnt Ellison just use Google to research the links between the killings at his house and similar ones across the U.S.? He knows to use computers and the Internet but he seems determined to do things the hard way -- such as getting a dopey deputy sheriff (James Ransone) and dull college professor (Vincent DOnofrio) to search for clues that a few clicks of the keyboard would have yielded.Call it the curse of the digital age. Sinister is a low-budget horror film trying for old-school shocks. But the production cant afford a pre-Internet setting so instead you have a protagonist haunted by the spectre of evil Mr. Google who fiendishly teases his victims by clouding minds and hoarding answers.Hawke isnt to blame for Sinisters many failings. With his perpetual guilty eyes and drawn features hes good at playing a haunted figure. Hed have made a great Hitchcock character.So would Fred Thompson whose brief appearances as a scolding sheriff provides a rare instance where a rural lawman isnt just a redneck rube.Mr. Boogie though needs to head back to Spook Central Casting and give Mr. Google more room to continue frightening the masses.Read more about GoogleThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Summit Entertainment Theres no shortage of ""found footage"" when it comes to todays horror movies or no worries of saturating that premise.Sandwiched in between the little-seen ""V/H/S"" and upcoming expected blockbuster ""Paranormal 4"" is ""Sinister"" in which Ethan Hawke stumbles upon some very bad home movies.Hawke is true crime writer Ellison Oswalt desperately looking for his next best-selling book after he has fallen into a slump. He and his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) relocate to a new town where some horrific murders took place in hopes of finding meaty source material for his book. Tracy makes her husband promise that their new home isnt a few houses away from a crime scene like their last one -- and it isnt. What he doesnt tell her Its the exact house where a family of four was left swinging from nooses on a backyard tree and where a daughter went missing.While fumbling around in the attic Ellison makes a grisly discovery a box of Super 8 movies each detailing the murder of a different family including the ones in his own back yard. One family is burned alive another drowned another sliced by a lawnmower. A strange shape appears in some of the frames someone known as Mr. Boogie who resembles something out of a ""Saw"" movie.Meanwhile Ellisons sons extreme night terrors increase the daughters drawings take a terrible turn and things start going bump in the night as what initially looked like a serial-killer flick takes on the supernatural. Director Scott Derrickson keeps the R-rated proceedings decidedly creepy and on edge though too many confusing elements eventually get stirred into what becomes an overflowing pot.But it comes together with a gruesome though excellent ending that some will find difficult to shake.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 12 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Oct. 11 2012 227PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Scott Derrickson Written by Scott Derrickson C. Robert Cargill Starring Ethan Hawke Juliet Rylance Classification 14A Genre horror Year 2012 Country USA Language English A crime writers quest for fame leads him into a world of demonic possession and home snuff movies in Sinister a mixed bag of old-school and contemporary horror tricks that occasionally raises a hair prickle of intrigue.Along with obvious debts to such seventies milestones as The Shining and The Exorcist Sinister also employs the current vogue for ""found footage"" shocks in such films as the Paranormal series (which shares producer Jason Blum). Though unoriginal the film by Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) is effective in a narrow range; its mechancially relentless in delivering grisly images like pies on a conveyer belt straight to the viewers eyeballs. Youtube frame grab Film Sinister official trailer Ethan Hawke wearing writerly big glasses a goatee and a cardigan plays Ellison Oswalt a true-crime journalist whose only bestseller Kentucky Blood came out a decade ago. Hes determined to get another hit book by writing about the unsolved case of a family that was ritually hanged from a tree in their backyard. Unbeknownst to his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) Ellison has moved her along with their adolescent son and daughter into the very house where the crimes took place. Though the regal Rylance a British stage actress participates in a couple of squabbles about Ellisons domestic shortcomings her presence barely registers here - less than the ominous corridors of their suburban home or even Christopher Youngs aggressive score.This is a movie thats mostly about Ellison watching and becoming increasingly implicated in what he sees. While exploring the attic on the first day Ellison comes across a box with Super 8mm film reels and a projector. The titles on the cans are domestically innocuous (BBQ Sleepy Time and oh yes Hanging Out). That night while knocking back a bottle of whisky Ellison watches the movies in his new study and realizes hes seeing atrocities taking place. Consistent with the complicity/guilt mechanism of this kind of film Ellison cant stop watching.The home movies are obviously important evidence but after starting to call the police Ellison decides instead to save the material for his book. While studying the films further he begins to see a white-faced long-haired figure who looks like a member of Kiss appearing in the background of some of the frames. On the advice of a bumbling deputy sheriff (The Wires James Ransone) Ellison calls up the local demonology expert played by Vincent DOnofrio who in a consultation via Skype tells Ellison this looks like the work of an ancient Babylonian ""eater of children"" who steals their souls by exposing them to certain images.As an explanation of the movie classification system this is novel (""Children under 12 may be stolen by demons"") but its a lazy exit strategy for the plot. (The introduction of a Babylonian demon in a horror movie is roughly equivalent to the ""Then I woke up and discovered it was a dream"" ending in elementary-school fiction.) For about half its running time Sinister maintains some ambiguity about whether the evil is in Ellisons sozzled head or in the supernatural world.In the psychological horror tradition there are lots of bumps in the night often provided by a troubled child with night terrors who keeps finding strange places to hide when he sleepwalks. Once the movie becomes a supernatural story it feels more self-parodying than scary. The obvious advantage of a supernatural solution is that it leaves room for many Sinister sequels to come. Demons who have been hanging out since Babylonian times are notoriously allergic to closure.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A true-crime author moves his family into a house with a gruesome history. BOTTOM LINE This locally filmed horror-flick is mostly unoriginal but occasionally effective; Hicksvilles DAddario as a troubled preteen provides some of the freakier moments. CAST Ethan Hawke Juliet Rylance Michael Hall DAddario LENGTH 150 In ""Sinister"" Ethan Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt a true-crime writer who moves his family into the very home where a quadruple-murder took place. There hell make an unsettling discovery a box of Super 8 movies and an old projector. Thats weird -- not because the cops missed it but because horror movies are usually focused on cutting-edge technology like smartphones (""One Missed Call"") and computer viruses (""Pulse""). New media can be scary because we dont yet understand it; who knows what lurks in those apps? But celluloid is such a warm friendly old format that it seems unlikely to contain the spirit of say a child-eating demon. Its like imagining Satan hiding in your cassette deck.

An old-media twist is about the only new idea in ""Sinister"" which follows the standard blueprint Oswalts marriage to Tracy (Juliet Rylance) is strained; their son Trevor (Hicksvilles Michael Hall DAddario) suffers night-terrors; their angelic daughter Ashley (Clare Foley) paints creepy pictures. A friendly deputy (James Ransone) helps out with sleuthing while the un-Earthly research comes from the usual university occultist (Vincent DOnofrio uncredited). Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") directs with some flair and Hawke digs surprisingly deep into his role as a fame-hungry writer. But the script by Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill (a film-critic blogger; talk about new media) is structured as a mystery whose answer we already know The demon did it Despite some effective bumps and frights and at least one memorable jolt from a full-throated DAddario ""Sinister"" is mainly just a series of snuff-reels with sick-joke titles like ""Pool Party"" and ""Barbeque."" The movie is set in suburban Pennsylvania but much of the filming took place on Long Island; the Oyster Bay villages of Muttontown Matinecock and Upper Brookville are thanked in the credits. PLOT A true-crime author moves his family into a house with a gruesome history.

Cmon Ethan Hawke youre better than this. Isnt there a ""Before Sunset"" sequel that needs your attention? In ""Sinister"" a heavy-handed horror movie from director Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") Hawke is Ellison Oswalt a true-crime writer looking to recapture the lightning in a bottle that was his breakout book now many years ago. So he moves his family into a house with a promisingly dark past -- without telling his wife (Juliet Rylance) and kids (Michael Hall DAddario Clare Foley) that bit of information -- and sets about trying to piece together the story of the very bad thing that happened there years ago. Mostly he does this by drinking whiskey and wandering around at night with the lights off. Maybe the guys just an energy conservation nut but Ive never seen someone so determined to keep himself in the dark literally and otherwise. Flashlight in hand he finds a box of old Super 8 movies in the attic. Watching them on a rickety projector he sees a series of murders. The first was shot at his own residence and the possibly related ones that follow are increasingly grisly. Heres the thing Found footage is scary when -- because -- it leaves you to fill in a lot of the blanks yourself. But actually watching whole families have terrible things done to them -- well hard-core horror fans may dig it I guess. Id call it forced voyeurism of the worst sort. Hawke ashen-faced and sweaty looks like he knows hes made a bad call with this one. Night after night his character prowls around twitchily leaving you to wonder which corner something will loom out of; its creepy the first couple of times and irritating the next 10. The films clearly going for a ""Shining""-esque commentary on artists and obsession but theres a reason Jack Torrance didnt work in pitch darkness. Gradually a supernatural element comes to the fore a media-savvy Goth called ""Mr. Boogie"" (Nicholas King). His origins involve eating children in Babylonia its explained to Ellison by a literature professor (Vincent DOnofrio amusingly doing his entire turn here via Skype). Credit where credit is due The wailing old-timey music that filters through the film especially over flickering Super 8 images is deeply unsettling and youll (be forced to) jump in your chair a number of times. The jolts feel unearned however and the conclusion downright bleak. But then to paraphrase Hawkes old ""Reality Bites"" character I guess Derrickson isnt under any orders to make the world a better place.

Yet even by these low standards the hero of ""Sinister"" is almost unaccountably dumb. So unfortunately is the movie. Played by Ethan Hawke Ellison Oswalt is a true-crime writer who in an effort to research his next book moves with his unwitting wife (Juliet Rylance) and two young children (Michael Hall DAddario and Clare Foley) into a house where the last occupants were hung from a tree in the back yard. Why on earth does he do this? For the same reason presumably that geologists feel compelled to live in underground caves. Oh they dont? And this is just the first five minutes. Before he has fully unpacked Ellison discovers a box in the attic containing a movie projector and a stack of Super 8 films with explicit footage of that most recent massacre along with several other similarly grisly murders going back to the 1960s and involving burning drowning and throat-slitting. After watching a few minutes of this charming snuff-film library the first thing Ellison realizes is that someone must have left the movies specifically for him. But who could it be? Think think. Ellison whose home office is plastered with maps strings of yarn photos and Post-it notes -- in a caricature of an FBI profilers office as one character wryly observes -- actually writes this brilliant question down on a piece of paper. If its the neighborhood welcoming committee wouldnt a casserole be more appropriate? Who else beside the murderer or his cinematographer would even have access to this material? Okay so Ellison isnt completely brain-dead. And yet despite being stalked by an apparent serial killer he doesnt even remotely consider moving out of the house. Not after he starts hearing footsteps and other scary noises in the attic where he also finds a scorpion and a snake. Not after his son starts having chronic night terrors. Not after someone -- or something -- keeps breaking into his locked office in the middle of the night and turning on the projector. And not even after he starts seeing the face of the presumed killer who is clearly recognizable from the films . . . in his own back yard. No. He does what any sane responsible father would do consult a specialist in the occult (Vincent DOnofrio) who tells Ellison that the culprit based on symbols left at the various crime scenes is most likely the ancient Babylonian deity Bughuul who feeds on the souls of children. (Note All of these details can be seen in the trailer -- which is really dumb.) Judging by appearance ""Bughuul"" means ""guy in a Scream mask."" Other nutty touches include ghostly children with their faces painted like extras from a Halloween-themed Cirque du Soleil show. Whats with all the pancake makeup? Remember 2010s ""Insidious?"" The bad guy in that movie which shares some of the same producers with ""Sinister"" was equally theatrical. None of this of course means that the movie isnt scary. It actually is from time to time. But its the kind of empty-calorie terror that may make you jump -- for a second -- but that doesnt freak you out as you walk back to your car or keep you up at night. Written and directed by Scott Derrickson the guy responsible for 2005s lousy ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" the movie is the ultimate in fast-food frights momentarily satisfying but unmemorable.

"Sinister delivers authentic chills with Ethan Hawke Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Sinister delivers authentic chillsThis interesting take on the found footage narrative is boosted by Ethan Hawkes desperate portrayal of a writer in pursuit of a homes gruesome mysteries.October 11 2012|By Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times Ethan Hawke stars in ""Sinister."" (Phil Caruso / Summit Entertainment )In ""Sinister"" Ethan Hawke plays a down-on-his-luck true crime writer desperate for a hit who moves his family into a house in which the previous occupants died under ominous circumstances. That turns out to be a big mistake.He soon discovers a box of old home movies actual filmstrip movies with the necessary projector even in the attic that seem to be a series of snuff films families murdered over decades with only fleeting glimpses of a mysterious ghoulish figure pointing to who is behind it all.Pursuing the story of those films and whether he has put his own family in the path of whoever made them drive Hawkes writer relentlessly to the brink of madness.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsWritten by C. Robert Cargill and director Scott Derrickson ""Sinister"" offers an interesting twist on the recent wave of ""found footage"" movies a in that the main character actually finds some footage that propels the narrative forward with the grisly home movies providing a series of unsettling interludes along the way.Hawke gives a committed performance as Ellison Oswalt a man torn between a desire to protect his family and a need to make his next book a sensational success. James Ransone delivers a strong supporting turn as a small-town deputy who just might be more on-the-ball than he first appears.Rather than another drearily workaday horror picture ""Sinister"" uses the supernatural to underline its examination of the all-too-human foibles of insecurity and myopic self-centeredness. As the best horror stories so often do ""Sinister"" makes clear that we are our own boogeymen the worst monsters of all.mark.olsenlatimes.com--SinisterMPAA ratingA R for disturbing violent images and some terrorRunning timeA 1 hour 50 minutesPlayingA In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Hollywood back lot moments Latest movie reviews PHOTOS NC-17 movies Why they got the rating MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESBelieve The Eddie Izzard Story goes inside the character...October 9 2009Prejudice Unexplained Death in Snow Falling on CedarsDecember 22 1999MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-sinister-20121012,0,898028.story",200,sinister6,sinister,latimes

(Phil Caruso2011 GAME CHANGE) BY Miriam Bale NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 11 2012 427 PM Title Sinister Film Info With Ethan Hawke Juliet Rylance. Found footage helps a writer solve a murder mystery in his new home. Director Scott Derrickson (150). R Violence. Area theaters. ""By the way this is in really bad taste"" says the sheriff when true-crime writer Ellison (Ethan Hawke) moves his family into the house where an entire family was recently murdered. Ellison is researching what he hopes will be his big comeback after a decade of lackluster sales and little critical success. A similar summary could be made of ""Sinister."" In its plot and even its title the movie feels like a grab bag of every popular horror trope of the last 30 years. That includes among other features the trauma-haunted house and the ghostly images on super-8 footage. Ridiculous and never scary and with the worst ghost makeup in the history of the horror genre ""Sinister"" is enjoyable even funny at times. Most amusing might be watching Hawke play a character willing to do anything to regain his fame.

"Movie review Sinister updates this old house of horrors - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Sinister updates this old house of horrors Share Tweet Share Tweet By Wesley Morris Globe Staff | 10.11.12 | 130 PM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Ahorror movie can be like an old apartment you just moved into. All it needs is a fresh coat of paint. ""Sinister"" is kind of like that. It basically moves into a house formerly occupied by dozens of cheap little chillers and makes a few small repairs. That tired new-family-in-an-old house routine? Those terrible shots of children bats etc. jumping out of nowhere for no reason? The obsession with juvenilia? Theyre all still here but the filmmakers have emptied the genre of most of its recent tics. The cliches are still cliches. Theyve just been renovated. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below So when Ellison Osborne (Ethan Hawke) his wife (Juliet Rylance) son (Michael Hall DAddario) and daughter (Clare Foley) unpack in an extra-strength Pennsylvania ranch house we expect to see telltale scribble-scrabble maybe a few undead kids and probably some demonic body contortions (downward devil). But the makers of this movie -- Scott Derrickson directed from a script by C. Robert Cargill -- appear to have thought about how to keep a mediocre horror movie from going bad. Theyve seen ""Jeepers Creepers II"" ""Silent Hill"" and anything involving an exorcism or made in Asia then remade by Hollywood and theyve removed all the aural clutter and visual noise. Now when Ellison walks toward a box and a body rises twisted from between its flaps theres no cut that says ""Psych you guys It was just a dream"" Thats the movies big trick (it happens at least three times) and sitting in a packed house thats waiting for a resetting cut that never arrives is fun. The Osbornes tension is ours and that feels good. And yet this is still a cheap chiller. It just hits that sweet visceral spot of dread more accurately than its cousins. Ellison has moved his family to this house to finish a new work of true crime about a series of murders the most recent of which occurred in its backyard. Each of the killings was filmed with a Super 8 camera and left along with a projector for Ellisons viewing pleasure. They have mock-innocent titles like ""Pool Party 86"" and the seamlessness between whats real and whats been filmed is clever. But eventually -- and I mean by about the second Super 8 viewing -- the evil in the celluloid and the movie-theater metaphors (attic as projection booth that sort of thing) start to feel like propaganda for digital filmmaking the way say ""Poltergeist"" was a warning against TVs. As much as ""Sinister"" wants to tell a story there isnt much of a story to be told. For an investigative reporter Ellison doesnt really do much interviewing or investigating. Thats outsourced to a wily young cop (James Ransone) who finds an occult expert (Vincent DOnofrio). All Ellison does is start to lose his mind. And here you get a movie that aspires to be some kind of self-conscious amalgam of ""In Cold Blood"" and ""The Shining."" It doesnt happen even though Hawke is ready willing and able to take us there. Hes just stuck in a movie thats pleased to have professionally painted over whats come before it. The paint is welcome but its not enough. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Blurry grainy and revealing little gore the scenes of past slayings demonstrate how tension done right is a lot more terrifying than graphic violence.But Sinister does little with the footage besides grind it into a bland hybrid of The Ring and Paranormal Activity though Sinister relies more on ""gotcha"" moments than storytelling.Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt a true crime novelist desperate to repeat the success of his best seller a decade ago. Sporting an elbow-patched cardigan and thick glasses Hawke is fine if cliched as an egomaniacal author so starved for fame he moves his unwitting family into the home of a family hanging -- the movies opening scene.Ellison is barely unpacked before he finds a box of Super 8 spools and a projector. With brandy in hand he watches reel after reel of the deaths a series of creepy and effective murders that got fanboys in a lather after the film debuted at the SXSW film festival earlier this year.The buzz is a puzzler particularly since Sinisters hero makes agonizingly dumb decisions and the movie draws so heavily from The Ring the 2002 chiller about a demon that possesses anyone who sees it on videotape.Sinisters villain is more tech-savvy and even Mac-compatible (Apple tie-ins are everywhere). Some of the films biggest jumps come from the demon haunting Ellison through his computer screen.So why is he called Mr. Boogie one of the films myriad boilerplate touches? For every genre convention Sinister sidesteps it follows with a formulaic turn. Ellison finds evidence of serial killings with a satanic edge but tells just one cop whom he swears to secrecy. Ghosts rattle kids scream and the house has a snake and scorpion problem. Yet Ellison doesnt warn his children that reptiles roam the attic. Or even call an exterminator.None of that would propel Sinister to its inexorable finale a showdown between Ellison and an ancient spirit that not only finds fresh ways to murder clans but gives his reality clips clever titles like ""hanging with the family.""For a horror film Sinister is hardly a bottom-feeder. Hawke can play the tortured soul and the fuzzy murders ensure a half dozen good starts. But this found footage belongs in the recycle bin.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare After hours of research Ellisons (Ethan Hawke) eyes begin to play tricks on him... 30 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/TzUXF5",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/10/11/sinister-movie-revew/1623837/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader,200,sinister9,sinister,usatoday

Sinister Good Director Scott Derrickson. Cast Ethan Hawke Juliet Rylance James Ransone. Rating R for disturbing violent images and some terror. That may sound silly but think about it -- too many comedies arent funny; too many dramas arent dramatic. There are a million ways to make a bad movie; these are just variations on a film not delivering what it promises. But ""Sinister"" now this is a scary movie. And given that its a horror film that means its a good one. Ethan Hawke who is on-screen for just about the whole thing is effective as a true-crime writer who gets a little too deep into researching his latest project. What director and co-writer Scott Derricksons film may lack in surprises it more than makes up for in creepy atmosphere and honest-to-goodness scares. It has been 10 years since Ellison Oswalt (Hawke) had a hit book. He has written a couple since but even he seems to agree that they were hack work trading on the success of the first and he burned a lot of law-enforcement bridges in the process. (Fred Thompson is on hand as the local sheriff to voice disapproval of his presence.) Now Oswalt is moving with his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and kids Trevor (Michael Hall DAddario) and Ashley (Clare Foley) to a small town in Pennsylvania where he plans to solve the mystery of a girl who went missing after the rest of her family was found hanging from a tree in their backyard. The film opens with a grisly homemade movie depicting the tragedy. Oswalt finds a box in the attic of his new home with 8mm footage of this and to his and our horror other murders each of which involve a single missing child survivor. These films are grainy startling and genuinely disturbing; this may be the first inventive take on found footage in a horror movie since the gimmick started showing up everywhere. Also disturbing is Oswalts descent into obsession over the case. Clues present themselves as he pores over the movies he has found (or maybe that found him). He begins to ignore his family for both his work and the bottle of booze he keeps in his office. He gets a little help and the film some comic relief from the seemingly dim-bulb cop he dubs Deputy So-and-So (James Ransone). He also gets some insight into what may be a link between the killings from a professor at the local university (Vincent DOnofrio) when it begins to appear that supernatural elements may be involved. A mysterious symbol seems to be present at the crime scenes. And truly scary a bizarre figure shows up in shadows in each of them. Derrickson gooses things with a few gotcha moments but the real horror is in the sick home movies and Oswalts reaction to them. He makes us feel as trapped as Oswalt in the halls and rooms of his home. And the attic ... Of course Oswalt should go to the authorities but his early encounter with Thompsons sheriff suggests that this wouldnt go well. So hes left to shoulder the load on his own. As is for the most part Hawke which he does with assurance. ""Sinister"" is scary stuff and all the more welcome because of it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Sinister Video Rated R  110 minutes  2012 This formulaic horror movie serves mainly to illustrate what a resourceful actor Ethan Hawke has become; as a washed-up true-crime author desperate for a hit he plays on his boyish energy to suggest a darting intelligence beneath the characters vanity and opportunism. The writer discovers a supernatural entity while investigating a series of unsolved murders and in a twist thats likely to please celluloid buffs the creepiest evidence comes from eight-millimeter film reels he must splice together himself. Most of this takes place inside the characters house and writer-director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) turns in some resourceful work too finding new ways to frame the same rooms from one scene to the next and providing comic relief whenever the action threatens to turn monotonously grim.

Ethan Hawke plays a true crime writer who gets a little too close to his latest project--the investigation of a gruesome multiple murder By Mary Pols MaryPolsOct. 11 2012 Share Read Later Summit Entertainment Sinister Year 2012 Director Scott Derrickson Studio Summit Entertainment Actors Ethan Hawke Juliet Rylance James Ransone Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Scott Derricksons much-heralded horror film Sinister is unlikely to leave you sleepless. At least it didnt me and Im a total wimp. The movie is full of feints shocks and scenes of particularly perverse violence but nothing about it is fresh enough to haunt you in the night. Its predictable. Its underlying theme--about the corrupting power of images passed like deadly chain letters--is effective but not as much as it was back when the Japanese film Ringu (The Ring) introduced it. Thats partly because the theme has been amplified so extremely; instead of a spooky girl climbing out of the television Derrickson shows us home movies that are essentially snuff films. Lots of them. Filmed images begetting more violence would seem a way to subvert the horror genre except theyre presented almost as pornography. There is no lesson learned here. Not unless you count the one the jerk played by Ethan Hawke gets. Hes the ideal emotionally expendable protagonist true crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) a guy with a whiff of Joe McGinniss about him. Ellison moves his whole family wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and young son and daughter into a house where Very Bad things happened--a family of four was killed in a ritual act--so that hell have an easier time researching his next book. Hes so arrogant and self-centered he doesnt consider how it might affect them and thats before more Very Bad things start happening. Hes not even partly apologetic when Tracy a week into living there finds out theyre living in a house that was the site of a notorious multiple homicide. (READ TIMEs review of the film that gave Sinisters director the idea Hawke could do horror) Well it didnt exactly happen in the house. ""It was in the backyard"" Ellison defensively declares to Tracy. Right there in that tree yonder with the broken limb where Mom Dad and two kids were hung in a neat little row. (Tracy allowed Ellison to pick a house in this new town sight unseen. Such passivity--hello Zillow.com--and her ability to sleep through epic occult-related happenings are among the movies weaker points. But Rylance looks cute in a tank top which is what shes there for.) Trouble begins up in the attic on the first evening but Ellison stays confident he can get to the heart of the mystery which he believes is manmade rather than supernatural. Its been 10 years since his last 1 bestseller Kentucky Blood and he needs this book. ""This could be my In Cold Blood"" he says. His stubborn refusal to drop the case plays into one of our baser instincts the desire to feel superior to a person who dares to feel superior to us. Which in turn makes it easier to see the person twist in the proverbial wind of horror. Hawkes on-target performance only enhances the fun; he stops short of the full weasel but no one is going to weep over the fate of Ellison Oswalt if things dont end well. As Naomi Watts did with the American remake of The Ring Hawkes classes up the genre (and looks a lot  more comfortable in these horror surroundings than say Daniel Craig did in the awful Dream House or Ryan Reynolds trying to pull off a credible killer in the remake of The Amityville Horror). (READ About why TIMEs Steven Snyder thinks Ethan Hawke is underrated) The hangings of the previous owners come to um life on the screen through the magic of home movies. Hearing bumps in the night Ellison finds a box of old Super 8 films and a projector in his new attic. The cans have cute titles like ""Pool Party 98""and ""Hangin Out with the Family"" yet gruesome content involving families going back to the 1960s. In the ensuing days Ellison watches each and every one of them. Alone. He could go to the police with the movies but he doesnt because hes too greedy for material. Ellison yammers on about his need for a writerly legacy but also more tellingly a hit language that speaks as much to the addiction of success as the bestseller list. When in a low moment Ellison watches an old videotape of his smug younger self at the pinnacle of his career being interviewed by Tavis Smiley I almost felt sorry for him. Much as I think Sinister has been over-hyped director Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) and his co-writer C. Robert Cargill a movie critic for Aint It Cool News who has said he dreamed up the plot after seeing The Ring (at least hes honest) definitely know something about the angst and squashed egos of word peddlers in todays economic climate. Some people will find it invigorating to watch various sets of hogtied parents and kiddies be drowned or burned alive or attacked with a lawnmower on ""found footage"" (how I long for found footage to get lost). I found it tedious gratuitous and a number of other supercilious-sounding adjectives that will cause hardcore horror fans to dismiss me as a priss. Whatever. I stand by the objection to imitation snuff films. To their defenders Id say so fine maybe faux snuff is your thing. But arent you sick of getting your horror yucks from spooky little girls with vacant expressions and tangled hair standing alone in rooms or hallways or landscapes? Do you never tire of a killer wearing a face mask? Id have been a lot more terrified by Sinister if its Boogieman didnt look so much like a sulky Gene Simmons in full stage makeup. Sinister simply shows too much overlooking the main instructive of the Paranormal Activity franchise a well played lump moving under the sheets can dissolve your spine. The best part of the movie is the comic relief all of which is movie-meta. Whoever is helpfully dropping off the home movies also provides an envelope at one point marked ""EXTENDED CUT ENDING."" Then theres the aw-shucks local sheriffs deputy (the excellent James Ransone of Treme who looks and sounds uncannily like vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan) with a fan boy crush on Ellison. He jokes that hes Deputy So and So and Derrickson and Cargill never assign him any other name. Deputy So and So does lazy Ellisons research for him and even finds him a handy professor (Vincent DOnofrio) who knows all about obscure symbols and creepy occult stuff and is willing to share. To enhance the claustrophobia (and likely to keep the budget down) Derrickson never takes us anywhere; not even to see the nutty professor who provides his helpful background via iChat. (READ TIMEs review of Hawkes last movie The Woman in the Fifth) To be fair my expectations were unduly raised in advance that Sinister was not just better than the average horror movie but good because early reviews from horror fans were so glowing. Hawkes participation didnt hurt either; hes an Academy Award nominee. Perhaps this is like rushing out to get a Big Mac after hearing of reports about a new delicious gourmet Big Mac being served somewhere. Instead I found the special sauce the same as it ever was greasy and displeasing like Hawkes facial hair and the whole experience marked mostly by a queasiness you know you deserve.

"Sinister | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sinister ) Sinister (United States 2012) October 11 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Someone finally figured out a way to make the concept of ""found footage"" interesting and its by incorporating it into the films overall scope rather than employing it as the governing factor. Sinister is an intense horror film that starts out masquerading as something more mundane. Its hair-raising and gripping although some of its narrative turns require a significant level of ""suspension of disbelief."" In true horror movie tradition characters do things that are head-scratchingly dumb. Once you accept those logic-defying moments the movie works with diabolical effectiveness. And even though the ending is inescapable (and therefore predictable) that does little to diminish its effectiveness. Sinister opens with a disturbing scene a Super-8 ""home movie"" that shows the hanging deaths of four people. As the narrative progresses we learn that this is one of several amateur snuff films in existence. Theres one of a family burning to death in a car one of a multiple drowning one where victims have their throats slit and a particularly nasty one in which the murder weapon is a lawn mower. During the course of Sinisters running we see all (or almost all) of these Super 8 movies; the rest of the film is presented using traditional 3rd-person cinematography (non-shaky cam variety). One element that makes the ""found footage"" approach work uncommonly well in Sinister is that it doesnat hijack the style. Theres no lingering question about why someone is always filming. Ethan Hawke who has been spending time recently in independent productions plays Ellison Oswalt a true crime author in desperate need of a new bestseller. Along with his supportive wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and his two children Trevor (Michael Hall DAddario) and Ashley (Clare Foley) he moves into the house where the hanging victims lived and begins researching the circumstances of their deaths. In the attic he finds a box of Super-8 movies that seem innocuous until Ellison watches them. For about the first 30 minutes Sinister unfolds more like a mystery/thriller than a horror excusrion as Ellisons investigation points toward the possible involvement of a serial killer. Then unexplained things begin to happen loud noises in the attic a film projector starting on its own and a demonic face moving in a supposedly ""still"" photograph on a computer screen. Sinister features its share of effective ""boo"" moments. The makeup for the mysterious figure is well-done. Its genuinely unsettling and doesnt feel like a re-harsh of any of the horror movie icons. Also because its shown only fleetingly it never loses its power to disturb as a result of overexposure. Director Scott Derrickson (whose resume includes the first-person horror film The Exorcism of Emily Rose as well as the big-budget remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still) develops an atmosphere that emphasizes isolation and claustrophobia. Aside from a friendly local deputy (James Ransone) Ellison has no one beyond his immediate family to turn to for support. Theres no generic best friend or brother. The suspense builds in tandem with a burgeoning sense of doom. Its a slow-burn approach that may not work on those infected with a need for brash fast-paced gore-fests. Sinister is plenty grisly but some of the bloodiest instances are left to the viewers imagination. Hawke is an effective ""everyman."" Heres an ordinary guy ill-equipped to cope with the supernatural. Hes not presented as the most altruistic of people. Hes affectionate toward his children but wouldnt win Father of the Year. Hes obsessed with fame and fortune; getting back to 1 on the best-seller list is his driving motivation. He drinks too much and ignores common sense. At heart hes a selfish guy. Acclaimed theater actress Juliet Rylance has little more to do than play the clichA(c)d ""supportive wife"" role until things get to the point where ""supportive"" equates to ""stupid."" Its somehow remarkable that she never packs up the kids and leaves. Vincent DOnofrio and Fred Dalton Thompson have small but important parts as an occult expert and a county sheriff respectively. In developing Sinister director Derrickson and his co-writer C. Robert Cargill display an unerring understanding of what will unsettle viewers in a darkened auditorium. They borrow liberally from earlier horror efforts with The Shining being the most obvious influence. Derricksons use of sound is particularly important. The bumps in the night are loud enough to cause viewers to jump in their seats and Christopher Youngs discordant score is perfect for the material. It has been a long time since there has been a genuinely creepy horror movie available to audiences in search of a good Halloween scare; Sinister provides that missing October ingredient.

What does horror sound like? We know what it looks like -- skulls and blood and fluttering ghosts and a mad doctor in white with a scalpel and a smile. But what does it sound like? A scream? A clap of thunder? A simple boo? ""Sinister"" comes up with a lot of different devilish answers. At first its story seems more from hunger than from horror -- a hard-drinking writer moves his family into a murder-scene mansion so he can write a book. Then late at night he starts seeing things. And if you cant predict whats going to happen next -- his wifes desperate pleas to move his childrens nightmares even the exact moment something jumps out and scares him -- you need to see more horror movies. Scott Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill have seen plenty obviously. Maybe too many. And Derrickson -- who previously made the overexcited ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" and the underwhelming new ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" -- should probably see some other types of films and some theater before he directs another actor. Ethan Hawke is a fine performer and the British stage actress Julie Rylance -- stepdaughter of Mark -- is no slouch. But Derrickson lets them both begin the film at such a fever pitch theres no place for them to go; when they actually have to signify a real fight halfway through theyre forced to amp it up to the edge of screaming hysteria. Supporting actor James Ransone meanwhile who plays a helpful deputy doesnt seem to have been given any guidance beyond ""Remember David Arquette in the Scream movies? Cool. Do that."" No whats really scary about ""Sinister"" is the sound of it. Its not necessarily the score either (credited to Christopher Young). Its the droning bits and snips of songs heard chopped up on the soundtrack. Its the sound design by Dane A. Davis which slows down or amplifies normal noises (a film projector a lawn mower) until they become something weird and hellish. Were used to horror movies that use sudden aural jolts to scare us of course -- a cheaply effective trick and one ""Sinister"" isnt ashamed of either. But theres something smarter and truly creepy-crawly about the way this movie sneaks up on your ears. Your eyes too. Although the screenplay feels cobwebbed at first (and lazy -- we have to pick up this couples back story as we go along and some things are never filled in) things gain power as the film unfolds particularly once Hawke finds a cache of home movies -- a serial killers home movies detailing ritualistic sacrifices. Its a grisly visual touch and -- as we watch Hawke watching them -- one that makes us complicit in the rubbernecking grisliness. So yes on the usual critical levels as a horror film ""Sinister"" doesnt quite measure up. Its not as intellectual as ""The Innocents"" or ""The Others"" as poetic as ""Pans Labyrinth"" or ""The Orphanage"" as full-out grisly as ""Manhunter"" or ""Seven."" But go see it and when you do give it a listen. And youll hear what scary sounds like. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language disturbing images and alcohol abuse. Sinister (R) Summit (110 min.) Directed by Scott Derrickson. With Ethan Hawke. Now playing in New Jersey.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Two trendlets of the mid-2000s--the hitch-stepped image-phobic world of J-horror films like The Ring and Pulse and bleak hard-R extreme horror--combine to diabolical effect in Scott Derricksons Sinister an occult thriller that scares with an absolute relentlessness. Derrickson previously directed The Exorcism Of Emily Rose a hysterical demon-possession movie that turned a chilling true story--realized much more subtly a year later in the German film Requiem--into an overcranked Exorcist knockoff. Derrickson pulls out all the stops here too with the jitters and jump cuts of a Nine Inch Nails video and a Trent Reznor-like score (by Christopher Young) to match. Its all done in questionable taste mucking around in the nasty terrain of snuff films and children in constant peril but Sinister is smart and well-crafted and it scarcely gives the audience a moment to breathe. An ideally cast Ethan Hawke brings dimension to the role of a true-crime writer whose egomaniacal quest for another bestseller lands his family in terrible trouble. His latest project involves the investigation of the hanging deaths of a couple and their two children and the disappearance of a third child. Without his wife (Juliet Rylance) and children knowing Hawke moves them into the murder house to work on his book and before long disturbing events start happening. The trouble begins when Hawke discovers a box of 8mm home movies sitting in the attic each depicting the gruesome ritual murder of a different family across the span of a few decades. With the help of a local deputy--a hilarious James Ransone (Ziggy from The Wire)--Hawke starts to put the pieces together but the connections lead him into a supernatural realm. Derrickson and his co-screenwriter C. Robert Cargill do their best to make the audience believe that Hawkes vanity and greed would lead him to put his family in immediate peril--with his drinking problem his obsessive myopia and his possible hallucinations there are shades of Jack Torrance in The Shining. As usual with ghost stories or stories of the occult the fear dissipates a little once the (in this case absurdly elaborate) mythology comes into focus and theyve tossed in a boy with night terrors just to crank the machine that much more. But scary is scary and Sinister moves with a full-throttle intensity--and residual creepiness--thats occasionally shameless and overwrought but hits like a battering ram.

But Sinister a mash-up of half a dozen other films not only contains a few honestly terrifying jolts its also the rare horror movie thats just ingenious enough about stitching together everything it borrows to make its second-hand quality kind of fun. Ellison Oswalt a celebrity author of true-crime novels played by Ethan Hawke at his most antsy and compelling is a knockoff of Jack Torrance in The Shining a writer struggling to produce who likes his whiskey too much whose work lures him toward mental instability and who moves his wife and kids into a home where gruesome murders took place. A family was hanged in burlap hoods from a tree in the backyard and Ellison is investigating the killings. We see the four bodies hanging and swaying in grainy ""amateur"" footage and theres an almost poetic eeriness to the image. That shot is part of a film that Ellison discovers in the attic in a box of old 8mm reels most of them from decades ago. The film canisters contain silent home movies of different families swimming enjoying a barbecue or not doing very much at all and the footage is intercut with grisly snuff-movie images of each family getting slaughtered in a hideous fashion. It all looks a lot like the home movies the hero of Michael Manns Manhunter uses to track down a serial killer -- and Ellison for all his Torrance-like torment is a lot like that films FBI profiler. At the same time he keeps freeze-framing the footage combing it for a clue to the killers identity just like the hero of Blow-Up. What he starts to catch glimpses of is a face that looks more than a bit like a latter-day Michael Jackson. That is if hed returned from the dead to portray a goblin in Paranormal Activity 6. My favorite thing about Sinister is derived from Ringu though in a way that connects it to a film I didnt even care for that much last summers Super 8. Its the notion of grainy amateur footage shot with a primitive ramshackle camera as a looking glass into the past -- the world of analog mystery. In Sinister digital technology (like the computer onto which Ellison transfers the scratchy old films) is lit by rationality whereas Super-8 footage in its blurry shadings and fuzzy warm colors has a lack of exactitude that allows it to contain ghosts. The movie was directed by Scott Derrickson who made the misbegotten possession thriller The Exorcism of Emily Rose and he has basically made a dont-go-in-the-attic movie that deftly cannibalizes the horror genre without a hint of an ironic wink. I knew perfectly well after a while what Sinister was going to scare me with. But I got scared anyway. B Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Daily Edition Login to download Sinister Film Review 731 PM PDT 10/9/2012 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Summit Entertainment Enjoyably edgy fright flick meshes serial-killer and haunted house ingredients. TWITTER Ethan Hawke stars as a crime novelist obsessed with a missing-girl case in Scott Derricksons latest scary movie. A true-crime author stumbles onto something beyond his beat in Scott Derricksons Sinister which follows Ethan Hawkes Ellison Oswalt as he grows increasingly obsessed with a missing-girl case he hopes will lead to a bestselling book. Occasionally stupid (stretching even fright-flick conventions) but scary nonetheless the pic should please horror fans. When Oswalts wife (Juliet Rylance) just uprooted to a new town (so he can investigate the new story) and already getting bad vibes from neighbors asks ""We didnt move a few doors down from a crime scene again did we?"" he assures her they didnt. She asked the wrong question Oswalt has bought the very house in which four members of a family were slain with the fifth abducted. An ornery sheriff (Fred Thompson) stops by before the boxes are even unloaded to warn the author hes not a fan of his books and doesnt cotton to a fame-hungry scribbler second-guessing his departments work. Local lawmen are soon the least of Oswalts worries. He finds a box of Super-8 films in the attic each showing a family being murdered in a uniquely grisly way. Believing hes stumbled across his own In Cold Blood he stays up nights scrutinizing the films and looking for connections between killings whose locations and victims are still unknown. Derrickson borrows the vibe of Joel Schumachers 8MM as Hawke swigging whiskey and giving the crease between his eyebrows a workout struggles with the horrible things hes seeing. But the film soon shifts into bump-in-the-night mode with an unseen visitor leaving clues for Oswalt in his own house and taunting him with increasingly unsettling (and harder to explain) stunts. Setting aside Oswalts infuriating unwillingness to turn on the lights when homicidal intruders infiltrate his home at midnight the movie has him doing some pretty unjustifiably dumb things -- like walking with a butcher knife thrust in front of him when he has every reason to think his sleepwalking young son might suddenly leap out at him. We allow him some of this thanks to the pictures coy suggestions that Oswalt might be going a little nuts due to the nature of his investigation. But Derrickson and co-screenwriter C. Robert Cargill are eager to draw in more familiar supernatural elements -- an occultologist (Vincent DOnofrio) identifies a crime-scene marking as a pagan symbol ""dating back to Babylonian times"" -- and the movies proceduralist pleasure takes a backseat to ghosts and a mysterious figure known as ""Mr. Boogie."" The scares are effective throughout helped a good deal by Christopher Youngs glitchy electronic score. While the end clearly points toward a possible franchise though many of the ingredients that make Sinister compelling wouldnt make sense a second time around. Some of them barely hold up for the first.

By Anthony Lane Ben Affleck stars in and directs a film set during the Iran hostage crisis.   Credit Illustration by Concepcion Studios The new Ben Affleck movie ""Argo"" begins in November 1979 with the storming of the American Embassy in Tehran. A crowd breaks into the compound taking more than fifty Americans hostage. Six escape through the back of the building and take refuge in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador. How can they be spirited out of the country or as the jargon puts it exfiltrated? Back in Washington the task falls to a C.I.A. staffer named Tony Mendez (played by Affleck) from the Office of Technical Services. Various plans have been mooted the most credible being that the hostages could make it to the border hundreds of miles away on bikes. Mendez however has an even better idea. Well not a better one but a more ridiculous one how about making a movie? Enter John Chambers (John Goodman) a prosthetics guru whose work on simian features for ""Planet of the Apes"" earned him an Academy Award in 1969 and whose talents the Agency has called on in the past. Mendez goes to Hollywood and asks Chambers to devise a nonexistent film find a script that requires a Middle Eastern setting and build up a simulacrum of a genuine production. Posters storyboards costumes read-throughs buzz in the trade papers everything will help. Mendez posing as an associate producer will fly to Iran issue false identities to the six Americans claim that they are scouting locations for a Canadian science-fiction movie and then fly them out. Four things should be said about this pipe dream. One it went ahead; two it worked; three it wasnt declassified until 1997; and four it makes for a good movie and further proof that we were wrong about Ben Affleck. Few of us watching ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" could see a way out or back for an actor so utterly at the mercy of his own jawline. Did he flinch at a future composed of all-American strivers each more earnest than the last or had he always been nipped by the directing bug? Whatever the case Affleck was suddenly there with ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2007) which was more roughened by energies and doubts than all his performances combined. He took the precaution of recruiting actors more formidable than himself--Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris--to boost his endeavors and that habit remains. ""Argo"" has Victor Garber as the Canadian Ambassador Bryan Cranston as Mendezs superior and most enjoyable of all Alan Arkin as Lester Siegel a producer so scornfully amused by Mendezs request that he has no option but to obey it. He does have one proviso. ""If Im doing a fake movie its going to be a fake hit"" he says. The fake they decide upon is entitled ""Argo"" made by a bogus company called Studio Six and lovingly described by Chambers as ""a twenty-million-dollar Star Wars ripoff."" I cant be the only person who ardently wishes that he and Siegel had gone ahead and shot it. Affleck has a lot of fun perhaps an ounce too much with the daftness of the film industry; when Mendez thinking ahead to the hostages cover stories asks whether you can be taught to direct movies in a day Chambers replies ""You can teach a rhesus monkey to be a director in a day."" No one is more skilled than Goodman with his faintly bullying geniality at dishing up lines like that but must we buy his characters implication that Hollywood is just another planet of the apes? Is it good for mendacity and nothing else? This matters because ""Argo"" is in part a battle of the textures. When it comes to period detail Affleck seems to take his cue from Mendez who worked for the Graphics and Authentication Division of the O.T.S.; just look at the typography of the opening credits with its bulbous seventies curves. Afflecks beard and hair style suggest someone who moonlighted from the intelligence services to pose for ""The Joy of Sex"" and as you study the fashions of the era you have to ask whether the Ayatollahs fury was provoked by U.S. support for the Shah or more simply by the width of Western shirt collars. Everything about the Tehran sequences in fact is a rebuke to style. The camera work is anxious and twitching with a grainy surface to match. Here we gather is the real thing life hemming us in like a mob. Then comes the climax. If you visit the C.I.A. Web site you can read Mendezs account of events in January 1980. ""As smooth as silk"" he calls the hostages passage through the airport whereas Affleck chopping up the action and spinning it out insures that no nails remain unchewed. This is absolutely his right as a teller of tales and ""Argo"" never claims to be a documentary. It struck me as a bit rich however to make such sport of Hollywood deceitfulness and then to round off your movie with an expert helping of white lies piling on car chases that never occurred. As for the aftermath it goes on forever. We get hurrahs for Canadian-American relations; a shot of Mendez hugging his wife from whom he has been estranged with the Stars and Stripes fluttering behind; images of the actual hostages presumably for any skeptics who still find the film implausible; and finally a voice-over from Jimmy Carter lauding the efforts of those involved. All this is frankly uncool--a pity because the rest of ""Argo"" feels clever taut and restrained. Why not close with the perfect coda that Mendez himself supplied? ""By the time Studio Six folded several weeks after the rescue we had received twenty-six scripts"" he wrote. ""One was from Steven Spielberg."" At the start of ""Sinister"" Ellison (Ethan Hawke) and his family arrive at their new house. ""I had to move here. The new story Im writing is here"" he explains. Hang on is he proposing this as a basic principle of literary composition? If so C. S. Lewis must have really stacked up the air miles on the red-eye from North Oxford to Narnia. Ellisons excuse is that he writes true crime--that shapeless and often shameless genre which is to good crime fiction what pornography is to romance. His latest project--""This could be my In Cold Blood "" he says--concerns a family that was hanged from a tree outside the very house where Ellison now dwells although somehow he has failed to inform his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) of this cheerful fact. Up in the attic he stumbles on a clue a boxful of old Super-8 films plus helpfully a projector on which to show them. Switching it on he finds himself watching scenes not just of the hanging but of other multiple murders from the past. Who made the film? Or rather WHO MADE THE FILM? as Ellison writes on his notepad. The director of ""Sinister"" is Scott Derrickson who co-wrote the script with C. Robert Cargill and we can but pray that they move on to a new bio-pic of Melville. Imagine his questions ONE LEG ONLY? and WHY A WHALE? The insertion of found footage into horror flicks is now so common as to be almost compulsory like the use of vomiting in mainstream comedies. What a golden age we inhabit. Ellison peering at the clips spies a masked figure known as Mr. Boogie; though that sounds like a bad compilation album from 1975 it refers to a mythological thief of souls thus plunging the film into the lair of the unnatural. Nothing wrong with that--irrational terrors beset another writer and his long-suffering family in ""The Shining."" But Kubrick had the common sense to keep the lights on in the Overlook Hotel and the wit to infuse a simple carpeted corridor with unease whereas Derrickson is playing with loaded dice. How can you hope or presume to crank up our dread of the inhuman when from the start you refuse to play by regular human rules? Throughout ""Sinister"" the rooms remain darker than crypts whether at breakfast or dinnertime and the sound design causes everything in the house to moan and groan in consort with the heros worrisome quest. I still cant decide what creaks the most the floors the doors the walls the dialogue the acting or the fatal boughs outside. None of this is fair to Ethan Hawke. From ""Dead Poets Society"" to ""Reality Bites"" and ""Before Sunrise"" to his modern-day ""Hamlet"" where he soliloquized on a video display Hawke was the standard-bearer of the adolescent temper as it wrestled its way into adulthood. The gauntness the waves of intensity the smarting humor they all made sense as if his duty wherever he trod were to spread a little Hamletry. As Ellison he looks unhappy and lost not because some smirking demon wants to joint him like a chicken and drag him to Hell which can happen to anyone in this kind of film but because the prison of middle age dank with fatherhood and money troubles is no place for a prince or for a kid who once dreamed of living like one. ""Sinister"" is a joyless ride and its frights are too contrived to be surprising yet somewhere stashed in the attic is a much less foolish film with Hawke at its heart. The only problem is WHO WILL MAKE THE FILM?  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993. More More Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.)

Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) a ""true crime"" writer who has been 10 years without a hit moves his wife and two younguns into a house whose previous tenants were mysteriously slaughtered hoping to get a lead on the familys still-missing daughter. That Oswalt manages to keep this bit of history secret from wife (Juliet Rylance) for as long as he does strains belief but in every other respect Hawkes taut performance--lightly parodying his own career doldrums while playing an egotistical hack whos a close cousin of John Cassavetess self-loathing actor in Rosemarys Baby--is totally credible. A trove of profane 8mm home movies that Oswalt discovers in the attic links the events hes investigating to a series of childrens disappearances occult murders and a corpse-painted boogeyman as the addictive snuff imagery infects the house with mischievous spirits who in one of many inventively crawly scenes hide-and-go-seek scamper through the halls around worry-seamed and whiskey-addled Oswalt. Opposite Hawke Vincent DOnofrio and James Ransone contribute excellent supporting bits the latter as a comic-relief deputy offbeat funny without resorting to obvious Keystone laughs scarcely diluting the films sickish sense of a horror that begins at home.Film Details Sinister RatingR GenreHorror Running Time110 min.

A believable Ethan Hawke gives it some grounding as Ellison a struggling true-crime writer who moves into a suburban house notorious for an unsolved mass slaying. He immediately discovers a stock of 8mm movies which offer a distressingly vivid insight into the crime. Not sharing the news with the wife and kids proves an unwise decision however when things start going bump in the roof space. Soon hes weighing professional priorities against the mental welfare and physical safety of his family.All of which proves engrossing enough. Hawke pieces together the grisly visual evidence while astute direction and effectively nuanced cinematography draw out telling unease from mundane interior spaces. Still over-reliance on loud noises and Christopher Youngs over-used over-emphatic score prove counter-productive. Also revealing the houses darkest secrets plays havoc with credibility - not least in a loopy final section which exposes the flakiness of the films ideas.

I actually enjoyed a lot about this - the cinematography the score (I actually thought this added to the tension) the acting. There were a couple of genuinely terrifying moments but the review is right in saying that it gets loopy - Id say silly - towards the end and turns into a forgettable made-up story.

Your pants. Do you like having them scared off you? Then you and your pants will enjoy ""Sinister"" a deeply frightening horror film that takes its obligation to alarm very seriously. If this isnt the most disquieting movie I see in 2012 I dont know if Ill be able to handle whatever is. Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is an author of true-crime books whose biggest achievement the New York Times bestseller ""Kentucky Blood"" was a decade ago. Increasingly desperate for another hit he has moved to a small Pennsylvania town where the disappearance of a young girl and the murder of her entire family were never solved. He intends to immerse himself in the case write a book and maybe bring about some justice. His reputation for being able to find things the police missed does not endear him to the local cops as represented by an unwelcoming sheriff (Fred Dalton Thompson). Hes not too popular with his own family either. His wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) is tired of moving to places where awful things have happened and being treated like a ghoul for it. Their 12-year-old son Trevor (Michael Hall DAddario) sometimes has night terrors and is at the age where he wants to know the grisly details of his dads work. And little Ashley (Clare Foley) a budding artist just misses their old house. Ellison does indeed find evidence that eluded the cops but not through any effort on his part. In the attic theres a box of old Super 8 home movies that would seem to have been planted there by someone with intimate knowledge of the murders. These films are marvelously creepy and Ellison is marvelously creeped-out by them. Hes also intrigued by the subtle clues they appear to offer. Would you be surprised if I told you that Ellison starts to see and hear strange things in his familys new house? Or that the murders depicted on those old films have more to them than meets the eye? Probably not. But what separates this from the average story about things that go bump in the night is the sheer dark intensity of it. ""Sinister"" has little use for levity or half-measures. Directed by Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") from a screenplay he wrote with C. Robert Cargill (formerly a Film.com contributor) the movie conveys its ghastly unsettling ideas without watering them down (and I might add without being needlessly graphic). Just a couple qualms. Its insinuated that Ellison is reluctant to take what hes found to the police because of something that happened with a previous book -- he arrived at the wrong conclusion and did some real-world damage apparently -- but the nature of the incident isnt explained nor does it justify withholding smoking-gun evidence like hes got now. Going to the cops with an alternate theory is one thing. Showing them a box of snuff films you found in your attic is another. ""Sinister"" also leans on the jump-scares more than it needs to (and more than it should). With so many genuinely unnerving ideas images and events at your disposal why keep using the cheap stuff? This is the unholy offspring of ""The Ring"" ""8MM"" ""Blow-Up"" and ""Poltergeist."" No pants are safe.

Anchored by a moody Ethan Hawke performance and classically unsettling scare tactics this icy supernatural thriller from director Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") and co-written by Aint It Cool News contributor C. Robert Cargill (aka ""Massawyrm"") delivers on the promise of its title by boiling down its appeal to pure atmosphere. The movie makes up for uneven dialogue and pacing issues through sheer horrific imagery starting with the first shot a grainy Super-8 of a family hanging from a tree playing in reverse. Thats one of several morbid death scenes discovered by true crime novelist Ellison (Hawke) a man on a vain mission to regain his popularity 10 years after his last hit. Uprooting his family for the umpteenth time to a small town where mysterious murders have taken place Ellison moves his brood to the exact spot of the aforementioned family slaughter. He wants answers so badly that he even lies to his concerned wife (Juliet Rylance) about the nature of his motives; exactly the kind of misdeed that this sort of formulaic exercise establishes so theres just reason to punish its misguided anti-hero. Although the dyspeptic local sheriff drops by to offer his disdain for Hawkes depiction of the police force ""Sinister"" remains almost exclusively within the confines of the writers new home. Armed with a boxful of Super 8 movies detailing brutal murders seemingly connected to the one that brought him this far Ellison spends late nights playing the material on loop until he starts to see a ghastly figure in the background. And is it staring back at him? Its here that ""Sinister"" resorts to drab scenes of Ellison roaming the abode after dark searching for the sources of bumps in the night. Every time it starts to sag however Derrickson injects a fresh scare owing much to the unexplored terrain of a child with night terrors. That would be  Trevor (Michael Hall DAddario) Ellisons adolescent son whose creepy somnambulistic tendencies find him popping up in dark places each time Ellison thinks hes about to discover something else -- until of course he discovers something else. Derrickson leads his lambs to slaughter with ample skill if not innovation. Relying too often on things that go bump in the night ""Sinister"" has its fair share of clunky moments particularly in its depiction of the marital drama used to flesh out the toll that Ellisons careerist obsession has caused. (""This could be my In Cold Blood"" he barks at her when she complains.) With a standard shrieking score and the usual jumps ""Sinister"" sometimes plays like a cheap unimaginative formulaic indulgence. Outsourcing the explanation for everything to a bland professorial type (Vincent DOnofrio) the movie lacks the ambition to tell a unique story. But the scaled down nature of the production is impressively old school. (Producer Val Lewton who invented this game in the forties with low budget studio efforts like ""Cat People"" would have loved it.) The ghostly visuals creeping into the plot retain an especially chilling value for the lack of information accompanying them and the supernatural figures are among the scariest to appear in an American horror movie since ""The Grudge."" Derrickson uses shadows and hyperbolic flashes of lightening with a powerful command over their implications. ""You can never explain something like this"" the sheriff warns Ellis and hes exactly right Menacing forces dont need a raison detre in order to legitimize their menacing qualities. Concluding the experience with a frightening climax that neatly caps the morbid feel ""Sinister"" doesnt break any rules but excels at following the spookiest of them. Criticwire grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? Summit doesnt plan to open the movie until October but its ""secret"" preview at SXSW played nicely with the festivals midnight crowd boding well for its box office success during Halloween movie season later this year.

Caveat emptor barely covers the fresh warning ""Sinister"" supplies in an already cautious real-estate market Dont buy a house where the previous family was hanged drowned incinerated or otherwise murdered unless you care to meet a similar fate. Ethan Hawke plays a desperate true-crime writer whose investigations into a shocking small-town death uncover a series of similar cases suggesting his own family could be next. The scares are not just intense but unyielding in this compelling horror yarn from ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" director Scott Derrickson which sneak-screened at SXSW seven months ahead of its Oct. 5 release. Law enforcement doesnt like Ellison Oswald (Hawke) who has made a career of exposing their mistakes on high-profile cases. But its been more than a decade since hes had a hit book and as the writers realization that he may be a one-hit wonder settles in his methods become more desperate. ""Sinister"" opens with an 8mm snuff film depicting a scene most auds would rather never see A mom a dad and two kids stand beneath a tree tied by noose to a branch that snaps up lifting them all into the air where they thrash to their deaths. With no suspects the local police got nowhere in their attempt to explain the murders; nor were they able to find the familys third child Stephanie (Victoria Leigh). Ellison aims to solve the mystery allowing the film to operate in heavy-exposition mode for much of its running time goosing the investigation every now and then with hints that hes getting help from whoever made that sinister homemovie. In contrast with previous cases in which Ellison moved his family into a house down the street from past crimes this time he actually bought the victims home empty except for a single box in the attic that contains five old film canisters each more nightmarish than the last. While his supportive wife (Juliet Rylance) and two kids uneasily adjust to their new life Ellison cracks open the whisky and fires up the projector. As if the deaths captured on film arent upsetting enough other clues reveal themselves in his obsessive research -- details that suggest a supernatural force may be at play. Through it all one message is clear Ellison needs to get his family out of that house. In concept ""Sinister"" offers yet another twist on the found-footage device so popular among horror pics these days but instead of using that setup to throw production value out the window Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill (an Aint It Cool News reporter who pitched the helmer his concept) favor the classical chiller approach. Blending darkly atmospheric widescreen lensing by Chris Norr (who also shot Hawkes ""The Hottest State"") with bump-in-the-night sound design from Dane A. Davis the crew transforms the Oswalds new house into a claustrophobic crazy-making space. Except within the gritty homemovies which implicate both Ellison and the audience in their unflinching voyeurism the camera hangs close to Hawkes increasingly agonized face capturing Ellisons deteriorating state of mind with a relish that recalls ""The Shining."" Though the film isnt the type to distract with in-jokes and references the appearance of an ax in the final reel cant be accidental. Unlike Kubricks classic however ""Sinister"" gives its writer-hero an enviably stable wife one capable of politely reminding her legacy-obsessed husband that his kids should take precedence over his work. As the disturbances intensify Ellison becomes convinced that some sort of figure can be seen lurking in each of the films a menacing painted-face personage with white skin and black triangle eyes. He consults a local occult specialist (Vincent DOnofrio literally Skyping it in) who spins tales of an ancient ""eater of children"" cementing ""Sinisters"" status as the sort of tale that would paralyze kids psyches rendered from the anxious perspective of a parent torn over whether to serve as provider or protector.
