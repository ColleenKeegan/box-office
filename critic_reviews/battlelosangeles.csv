Comments click to enlarge Battle Los Angeles Video Rated PG-13  117 minutes  2011 Packed with gung ho war-movie cliches and subpar shock-and-awe visual effects this terminally stupid sci-fi adventure pits an army of tentacled aliens piloting Transformer-style robots against a platoon of stoic warriors from the Fifth Marines Second Battalion (the legendary ""Retreat hell"" battalion of World War I). These gritty rainbow marines--multigender multiethnic and multistereotyped--are led by a staff sergeant with a checkered past (Aaron Eckhart) who eventually inspires his troops to compare him to John Wayne. Though the aliens are supposedly attacking the entire planet the key action here centers on Santa Monica where the marines find time to rescue three adorable children a weeping father (Michael Pena) and a sexy veterinarian (Bridget Moynahan).

"Battle Los Angeles review A movie full of sound and fury and laughable dialogue |       NJ.com comments Battle Los Angeles review A movie full of sound and fury and laughable dialogue Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 11 2011 at 753 AM View/Post Comments Columbia PicturesL-R Michael Pena Ne-Yo Joey King and Aaron Eckhart in ""Battle Los Angeles."" Aslithering slimy alien that looks a little like some bad clams casino I once had in Point Pleasant is lying wounded on a rubble-strewn floor. A woman pushes her way through purposefully. ""Maybe I can help"" she says. ""Im a veterinarian."" Yes welcome to the first -- but not the last -- big guffaw in ""Battle Los Angeles"" a video game without a joystick a sci-fi movie without a point and pretty much two hours without a break. That is if it werent for the occasional snarky giggles. Aaron Eckhart is our hero a staff sergeant who lost some good Marines on his last tour and is getting ready to retire. But first hes assembled a new platoon of cliches. Scared Kid. Noble Immigrant. Husband-to-Be. Bashful Virgin. Guy From the Garden State. Movie Review Battle Los Angeles (PG-13) Columbia (116 min.) Directed by Jonathan Liebesman. With Aaron Eckhart Michelle Rodriguez. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains violence and strong language. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS We only learn about the last one later though when theyre looking for an escape and someone shouts ""Who here can drive a bus?"" And the answer comes ""Stavrou can -- hes from Jersey man"" No I didnt really get it either. Then again it was hard to pay attention. With every shot hand-held and most in close-up this may be the first feature filmed in Nauseavision. Even a simple scene of two people standing in a room jumps about like the cinematographer dropped a mongoose down his trousers. And thats before the aliens even get here. Once they do of course things get worse for everybody -- mostly for the audience. Our brave cardboard characters -- joined by a new cliche the Feisty Latina -- grab their guns and start firing. The aliens fire back. Many fireballs ensue. Excitement? Not so much. Eckhart juts out his rather formidable chin and just plows ahead which is probably the best way to face any disaster including a movie like this. As the aforementioned Feisty one Michelle Rodriguez does her single super-neat acting trick. Want to know it kids? Okay when asked a tough question look to the right. Wait a beat. Then look back at the other actor and say your line. Now you too can make ""The Fast and the Furious"" movies It doesnt take long here though before youre wishing you were watching ""The War of the Worlds"" -- and the old one with Gene Barry. Or ""Starship Troopers."" Or even the goofy ""Independence Day"" which at least had Will Smith going for it. ""Battle Los Angeles"" though just has an awful lot of noise and rickety aliens that look like you could take them out with a baseball bat. Plus a title -- and an ending -- that threaten a sequel. (""Battle Burbank""?) And then of course theres that dialogue. Great red spot of Jupiter theres that dialogue. ""I got my men killed"" Eckhart spits out at one point. ""Theyre dead. Im here. Like the punch line to some bad joke."" Dont worry E-man. Youve got company. And none of us are laughing -- except when were not supposed to.

By Peter Rainer Film critic March 11 2011 Save for later Saved A Marine platoon faces off against an alien invasion in Los Angeles in Columbia Pictures action thriller Battle Los Angeles. Columbia Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Mysterious objects - meteors? - are streaking toward Earth and not just any old place on Earth. Major cities - London Paris ... Los Angeles The home of Hollywood and all things shallow. What better place to pulverize. But wait - it gets worse. These UFOs turn out to be alien invaders. And only the Marines can stop them.Maybe the Marines should consider using ""Battle Los Angeles"" about which I cogitate as a recruiting tool. Sure its tacky and the hovering alien space drones look like hairy chandeliers but the Marines come out on top - sort of. Its difficult to determine if these aliens once they die are really dead. It all gets pretty gloppy.Aaron Eckhart plays Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz who is about to retire when the aliens pull him back in. With his hawklike profile and square jaw the hyperstalwart Eckhart looks like a comic-book hero and acts like one too. Hes so stalwart he creaks. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Is ""Battle Los Angeles"" which was directed rather enterprisingly by Jonathan Liebesman a metaphor for the U.S. immigration problem? Its certainly a metaphor for something - maybe Hollywoods hidden desire to see itself go up in flames? When the military brass warns that ""were about to be colonized"" you wonder if they mean to shut down the borders. Its probably not coincidental that the film is replete with Latino actors or that one of the prime subplots involves a Hispanic father trapped behind enemy lines with his young son. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? In Pictures Famous Aliens If ""Battle Los Angeles"" has a message its probably this We need our human aliens to fight off space aliens. Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for sustained and intense sequences of war violence and destruction and for language.)

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 11 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Dont mean to boast but I can suspend my disbelief as willingly as any credulous moviegoer. Yet not even an industrial crane would have helped here. Nope Battle Los Angeles completely defeated me. Through every unlikely second of its nearly two-hour running time that poor old disbelief of mine remained deeply entrenched and I confess to feeling a certain shame in not being able to get it up. Of course as always in such cases Im eager to lay the blame elsewhere and to point out the obvious Hey this flick isnt so much a feature film as a recruiting poster for the U.S. Marine Corps. But is that a defence or just an excuse? Either way I clearly wasnt man enough. Movies Battle Los Angeles The official trailer I cant claim to have been deterred by any excessive novelty. The sci-fi premise is your stock War of the Worlds stuff. You know the drill That supposed meteor shower is actually a total invasion of the earth by colonizing aliens. Indeed right off the hop the globes major cities have all succumbed save for the one boldly cast in the title. ""We cant lose Los Angeles"" is the defiant cry and with good reason. Those other trifling capitals - Paris London New York - can be done without but not the movie capital. Otherwise who would make jingoistic jive like this? Flash back to 24 hours before the invasion just long enough to introduce the plucky platoon of Marines dispatched to single-handedly rescue the planet from extraterrestrial clutches. Chief among them is Staff Sergeant Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) a grizzled vet who having acquitted himself less than nobly in Iraq hopes for better luck with his next batch of foreigners. His helpmates can safely remain nameless since theyre really just there as either fodder for the cannon or founts for the jingoism - which come to think of it amounts to the same. Anyway our band of brothers (plus a sister or two) heads off to the mean streets under the xenophobic marching orders of every/// war ""Kill anything that isnt human."" Initially its urban guerrilla combat against an enemy they cant see. Unfortunately neither can we which makes the first action sequence a rather one-sided affair. Yes bullets are whizzing bombs are bursting soldiers are dying and director Jonathan Liebesman is assaulting us with the standard-issue array of cluttered close-ups. Apparently despite these heroics its awfully hard to dramatize a conflict with an invisible assailant. Happily we soon catch our first glimpse of the bellicose ETs but alas they too look standard-issue - just more of those metallic robotic tentacled thingies. Familiar also is their imperialistic goal to plunder our natural resources in order to fuel their technology. Obviously such motives are not unknown to American fighting forces a fact that helps to explain (1) why they appear so unflappable about the aliens presence and (2) why a mere handful of them are required to repel the entire intergalactic force. Well now its making perfect sense and I feel even worse about my limp disbelief. Apologies - my bad. But the real battle is just beginning. All of us actors and audience alike are charged with the further mission of clawing our way through heavily-mined thickets of dialogue a task (trust me) far more daunting than the piddling matter of fending off bullies from outer space. Consider this Vimy Ridge of a mouthful ""Were fighting for our lives our families our homes and our country."" Or this Dieppe ""Id go to hell and back for you."" Or this Waterloo ""I need you to be brave for me. I need you to be my little Marine."" Forget the popcorn and pass out the Purple Hearts - survivors of this verbal onslaught deserve nothing less. But not everyone survives. Among the dead is an alien corpse on which an eager Marine performs a quick autopsy to locate its vulnerable organs thereby learning how best to off its buddies. Vulnerability found he yells ""This is where we kill these things just to the right of where the heart should be."" Bonus. Not only is that good advice when taking aim at heartless aliens it works even better with mindless movies.

Theyre dead Im here -- like the punch line of a bad joke"" Marine sergeant-with-a-past Aaron Eckhart mutters through a clenched jaw referring to deceased comrades in Afghanistan at the low point of ""Battle Los Angeles."" This silly extraterrestrial-invasion epic somehow manages the feat of making the destruction of La La Land seem tedious. That line and a few other howlers drew big laughs from the otherwise unresponsive audience at a screening I attended the other evening. If the filmmakers had added the newly available Charlie Sheen and a few more punch lines to this demented mash-up of ""Platoon"" ""Black Hawk Dawn"" and ""Starship Troopers"" it might actually be the funniest movie released so far this year. Instead be prepared to endure long dull stretches cheesy special effects and so much shakycam footage (a la ""Cloverfield"") they should hand out airsickness bags at the popcorn counter. Director Jonathan Liebesman (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning"") may want to emulate the grunts eye view of the battles in ""Black Hawk Down"" but hes no Ridley Scott Its often impossible to tell whos doing what to whom. The invaders (mostly glimpsed at a distance) appear to be more aggressive relatives of the prawn-like interned extraterrestrials in ""District 9."" But theres no political satire in Christopher Bertolinis deadly serious tin-eared recruiting poster of a script which at one point has a fist-pumping Eckhart proclaim ""Marines dont quit"" Eckharts character has just been approved for a discharge when not-from-Mexico aliens begin landing off the beaches of Santa Monica. Hes ordered back into action as the second-in-command to a much younger and less experienced officer whose platoon is assigned to evacuate a handful of civilians from an area set to be carpet-bombed. This band of stereotypes (the one with post-traumatic stress the gun-shy rookie the grunt who blames Eckhart for his brothers death etc.) is mostly played by unknowns. Veteran action star Michelle Rodriguez has little to do as a communications officer; Bridget Moynahan fares even worse as a veterinarian who diagnoses the ETs weaknesses. Michael Penas single father is clearly on hand to serve as collateral damage. ""Battle Los Angeles"" picks up a very small head of steam when our heroes fight their way up a freeway and into the center of the city. Anyone hoping the firefights in this flick -- filmed entirely in Louisiana -- will reach Beverly Hills is going to be sorely disappointed. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Former Frasier star Kelsey Grammer to become a grandfath...

A repetitive and somewhat unoriginal film H.G. Wells did it better in his ""War of the Worlds."" Starring Aaron Eckhart Michelle Rodriguez Bridget Moynahan Michael Pena Ramon Rodriguez Will Rothhaar Cory Hardrict Jim Parrack Gino Anthony Pesi Ne-Yo Director Jonathan Liebesman Running time 156 Release Opened Mar 11 2011  Editorial Review To live and die in L.A.By Mark JenkinsFriday March 11 2011A cross between ""The War of the Worlds"" and a Marine recruiting film ""Battle Los Angeles"" sends a bunch of earnest leathernecks into the most hostile territory theyve ever experienced Santa Monica. Twenty major cities around the world have been attacked by metal-sheathed extraterrestrials yet this shootem-up focuses on only one steaming slice of L.A. County. While the movie occasionally pulls back for a wider view it emphasizes the effects of the intergalactic brawl on a lone Marine patrol led by no-nonsense Staff Sgt. Mike Nantz (chasm-chinned Aaron Eckhart). The repetitive point-and-shoot story line suggests an M-rated video game but the movies pounding symphonic score and irony-free outlook are closer to World War II B-movies. So are its lack of humor and embrace of cliche. Nantz for example is tormented by memories of the men he lost in Iraq and has just received his discharge papers when the brutal ETs attack. Did somebody mention Iraq? ""Battles"" depiction of block-by-block urban combat against an implacable enigmatic foe evokes Baghdad at its bloodiest. But director Jonathan Liebesman (whose background is in horror flicks) isnt interested in allegory nuance or social comment. He just wants to line up platinum-plated space-squids to be blown away. Pressed back into service Nantz will inevitably prove himself to his mistrustful troops with his valor and ingenuity. At one point he even rappels out of a chopper with the intention of single-handedly defeating the most destructive alien force to assault Earth since well ""Skyline. Nantz and his boys - and a female straggler Air Force non-com Elena Santos (Michelle Rodriguez) - escort civilians out of the battle zone. The troops suffer heavy casualties but dont worry about the children the troops rescued. This close to Hollywood nobodys going to let any kids die. Instead Nantz declares one boy Hector an honorary member of the patrol informing him solemnly that ""Marines dont quit."" If ""Battle rates a sequel expect to see Hector a few years older and in a Marine uniform. As in ""The War of the Worlds"" the story turns on the secret vulnerability of the alien scourges. These invaders are so powerful that you may wonder why they bother to engage in street fighting with puny humans. But they must have a weakness. H.G. Wells did it better. This movie spends so much yawn-inducing time on variations of the same combat scenario that its final showdown feels rushed. Thats why ""Battle Los Angeles"" would have worked better as a video game. Viewers who adore the bang-bang could have sustained it for weeks. And the rest of us could have looked up the cheat codes and jumped straight to the anticlimactic ending.Contains intense war violence and destruction and profanity.

Photo Richard Cartwright Image 9 of 9 Battle Los Angeles review Semper fi 1 / 9 Back to Gallery Battle Los Angeles Sci-fi action. Starring Aaron Eckhart and Michelle Rodriguez. Directed by Jonathan Liebesman. (PG-13. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Battle Los Angeles"" takes a big ""what would happen if"" premise - in this case a massive alien invasion - and then fulfills that premise by taking it seriously. Not self-seriously. The movie is lots of fun but it stays true to the terms it establishes telling the story through the eyes of one Marine platoon assigned to rescue civilians in Santa Monica. In this way we see the aliens only as the guys see them - first in just brief glimpses then later in intimate and grotesque detail. We get acclimated to battle. And the whole time we feel the anxiety of knowing were only getting a piece of the story that other battles are waging on the East Coast in Paris in London in Japan and that victory seems almost inconceivable. ""Battle Los Angeles"" is not in the big-picture crowd-pleasing tradition of ""Independence Day."" Think of it as ""The Hurt Locker"" of alien invasion movies. By putting us down on the ground with the guys the situation becomes more unsettling more disorienting and the scenario presented feels more like how a thing like this might actually happen First reports of meteor showers. Then more meteor showers. Then wait are those really meteor showers? And then ""Oh no"" Related Stories Battle Los Angeles Essential to the movies success is Aaron Eckhart who plays a Marine staff sergeant as though he were in a World War II movie no camping it up no comedy no winking at the audience no smiling. Hes just a tough guy with lots of emotional scars who is very good at his job. Eckharts commitment to the movies reality which is as fierce as the sergeants commitment to his men takes what otherwise might merely have been outlandish and makes it believable and frightening. Theyre trying to colonize us - these gangly big-headed spindly creatures - and how do you fight something you dont even want to look at? And how do you fight weapons you dont even understand? The aliens have a fighter plane that looks like a flying Christmas wreath in which each pine needle is either a light or some kind of laser death ray. Tell an audience this and it means nothing. But put viewers in the midst of a battle and have something like this suddenly loom above the frame and it feels a lot more personal. Context is everything The special effects are probably excellent but the truth is you wont have time to appraise them as special effects with the reality of the movie bearing down on you at all times. So apparently San Francisco and San Diego folded up like cheap handkerchiefs and Los Angeles is the last human stronghold on the West Coast. Say what you will about L.A. but its good for alien fighting - mostly flat and spread out with lots of neighborhoods unattached houses and wide streets. It also has plenty of gas stations which can be useful whenever an incendiary moment is called for. Christopher Bertolinis screenplay isnt big on witty repartee but he takes time to introduce each character and throughout Bertolini and director Jonathan Liebesman find ways to define every phase of the catastrophe in human terms. No shortcuts were taken in the crafting of the story. The filmmakers repeatedly set up expectations thwart them and come up with something far worse and more agonizing than you expect. The filmmakers dont make it easy on their characters. Even better they dont make it easy on themselves and best of all they dont make it easy on us. The battle in ""Battle Los Angeles"" is grab-the-armrest tense until the last seconds. -- Advisory The aliens are ugly and there are a lot of dead bodies. But these have to be the politest cleanest-talking Marines ever. They dont even curse at the aliens. They want to take back Los Angeles while avoiding an R rating.

Battle Los Angeles is not fought in Los Angeles. It rages over the seaside city of Santa Monica. Columbia Pictures Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) is a staff sergeant close to retirement. Then the aliens land in Battle Los Angeles. EnlargeClose Columbia Pictures Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) is a staff sergeant close to retirement. Then the aliens land in Battle Los Angeles. Perhaps filmmakers feared paying customers dont give a hoot about the town. No matter. Battle could have burned through Santa Monica Los Angeles or Rancho Cucamonga. The movie still would buckle from cardboard protagonists and a script that echoes a Marine recruitment video. You have to give director Jonathan Liebesman some points for sparing no shell casings or standing buildings to hustle us through the films languorous two hours. But Battle borrows so generously from 2009s terrific District 9 (nominated for a best-picture Oscar) and Saving Private Ryan (which should have won the best-picture Oscar) that even a time-tested premise feels too well-worn here. We are introduced to a barrage of Marines with flash-card pasts battle-weary Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) who is a staff sergeant this close to retirement; commander Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez) brash but inexperienced; and sharp-tongued Santos (Michelle Rodriguez) beautiful tough and with something to prove. Dont worry if you cant keep up with the names and back stories Battle revisits nary a one. Just know this The aliens have landed and theyre not here to boogie board. Like a lot of Hollywood villains they speak in a reptilian hiss and look like bugs. The mission as spelled out in narratives for those too slow to follow the convoy is simple Get out of Santa Monica before the military flattens the place. About the movie Battle Los Angeles  out of fourStars Aaron Eckhart Ramon Rodriguez Michelle Rodriguez Director Jonathan Liebesman Distributor Sony Pictures Rating PG-13 for sustained intense sequences of war violence and destruction and for languageRunning time 1 hour 56 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Thats an open invitation to car races gunfights and alien whomping. Yet Battle Los Angeles accepts only part of the offer not showing us enough of the aliens and instead force-feeding lines like ""Id go to hell and back for you"" There is one group that Battle gets right the media. Within hours of the invasion networks decide that aliens are colonizing us and draining oceans for fuel. Apparently extra-terrestrials like their gas-guzzlers too. All of which could be fodder for a fun alien romp. Who doesnt want to see L.A. traffic washed away along with those dopey weather reporters? But Battle takes its fight so seriously that its hard to get behind the mission. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Battle Los Angeles Fair Director Jonathan Liebesman. Cast Aaron Eckhart Michelle Rodriguez Cory Hardrict. Rating PG-13 for sustained and intense sequences of war violence and destruction and for language. Guide to this weeks new releases Invasion of the alien movies Louisiana won Battle thanks to tax credits And if youre going to put Aaron Eckhart in it you ought to make it good. ""Battle Los Angeles"" fails miserably on the first front offering up metallic buglike things with weapons surgically attached to their . . . well whatever it is they have for arms. They are about as generic as aliens get - a little tougher to kill than humans certainly but thats about the only way they differ from sinister Soviets in a Cold War movie or nasty Nazis in a World War II film. (At least were spared the agony of bad fake accents.) As for the quality of the film well Eckhart elevates it merely by being in it - hes a terrific actor. And director Jonathan Liebesman knows his way around intense action scenes of which there are gracious plenty. Unfortunately screenwriter Christopher Bertolini has given Eckhart and Liebesman a story so riddled with war-movie cliches that it contains almost nothing else. For starters Eckhart plays Marine Staff Sgt. Michael Nantz whos retiring after 20 years in the corps. We learn early on that his last tour didnt go well; he was decorated but lost many men. He agrees to train one more group of recruits but then strange meteors begin falling all over the world. The next thing you know the entire base is mobilized preparing for battle. They arent meteors of course. Theyre aliens and their first appearance is a highlight of the movie storming the beach in Santa Monica as if it were some kind of alternate-universe Normandy. As fate combined with bad writing would have it Nantz must fill in for another sergeant. Not only does he find himself serving under brand-new 2nd Lt. William Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez) just transferred from central casting but he also has Cpl. Jason Lockett (Cory Hardrict) in his unit - the brother of one of the men killed on Nantzs last mission. Liebesman does a good job of ratcheting up the tension as it becomes more and more clear that the aliens mean business in the worst possible way. How bad have things gotten? This bad The plan is to level Santa Monica with any luck taking out as many aliens as possible. (Without giving too much away we can all agree that anytime a gruff military commander declares ""We control the air"" we really dont.) Nantz and his unit first must sweep part of the city where civilians are known to be trapped and get them out. In three hours the bombs fall whether they get out or not. This is the best part of the film - the Marines naturally freaked out but holding to their training as much as possible scurry through alleys trying to avoid the aliens. At this point weve not gotten a good look at them so we see what the Marines see not much just fleeting images through a veil of smoke and debris. Its downhill from there alas. Liebesman does an effective job of creating a bombed-out Southern California (though the film was shot in Louisiana). But not only do the aliens turn out to be pretty boring the more we learn about them but Liebesman too often halts the action for a soul-searching speech from Nantz which is a waste of Eckharts talent and our time. Happily the Marines always get back in the fight. As it stands ""Battle Los Angeles"" is good dumb fun. A little less talking and a little weirder alien and it might have been something more.

Natural disaster (Earthquake 2012)? Hook it up. Postwar apocalypse (The Omega Man)? Bummer dude. And if all else fails the beaches skyscrapers and bumper-to-bumper freeways dont stand a chance under a good old-fashioned alien invasion.That brings us to Battle Los Angeles the latest movie to push Americas west coast cutting-edge metropolis to the brink of Armageddon. This time the enemy takes the form of spindly attackers from space part metallic armament and part gooey squishy flesh. The cretins want our water supply so the remarkably composed TV talking heads tell us in the background and from the moment they splash down in the Pacific Ocean theyre ready to destroy anyone that begrudges them a drink. In short they dont come in peace.Unlike the hedonistic party people sucked into the LA sky in last years blink-and-you-missed-it Skyline the Angelenos on the line in Battle Los Angeles are the few and the proud. Yes the Marines are here to save the day led by square-jawed Staff Sgt. Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) and his diverse band of 21{+s}{+t}-century brothers. Be aware that Battle Los Angeles is a war movie not a sci-fi yarn and that it plays out much like a feature-length advertisement for the values and valor of the Corps. Semper Fi space guy.Seeing as most of Battle Los Angeles was shot in the other LA Louisiana theres little immolation of famous architecture or beloved In-N-Out Burger locations. This Battle is a grind-it-out street-level affair; military tactics and minor-key interpersonal drama between the guys (and one gal played by perennial butt-kicker Michelle Rodriguez) take precedence over massive spectacle.As wars go this one is a sturdy slog with positions to be taken and held (a police station in West LA figures prominently) and a steady rhythm of skirmishes with Earths well-armed foe. (Battles rage away in other cities including Paris and Tokyo but as we all know LA is where all the cool stuff happens first). This kind of cinematic warfare poses challenges In capturing the chaos of combat you run the risk of confusion and monotony and Battle Los Angeles has its share of both. It also refrains from the more ludicrous flourishes of say Independence Day and it maintains a moment-to-moment sense of grit that makes up for a cliche or six.Battle Los Angeles is strictly a PG-13 affair which means these Marines use a kinder gentler vocabulary than most. But as they remind us at every turn theyre not about to give up. Not when the fate of Disneyland the Lakers and California dreaming lies in the balance.B- Starring Aaron Eckhart Ramon Rodriguez Cory Hardrict Ne-Yo Michelle Rodriguez Michael Pena and Bridget Moynahan.

"Movie review Battle Los Angeles - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Los AngelesMovie review Battle Los AngelesExplosions and Aaron Eckhart star in the alien invasion film directed by Jonathan Liebesman.March 11 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic [A Marine platoon faces off against an alien invasion in ""Battle... (Columbia TriStar )Before we begin a moment of silence please for all the brick and mortar that made the ultimate sacrifice for ""Battle Los Angeles."" Sob. Let me just grab a tissue. Sorry. Let us not forget the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air either. The pyrotechnics are patriotic sizable and clearly the star of ""Battle Los Angeles"" so dont let the tight shots of Aaron Eckharts chiseled jaw and cleft chin fool you. The movie directed by Jonathan Liebesman is very much in the tradition of those old World War II films you find on late-night cable with rickety fighter planes engaged in long skirmishes that you cant follow all that well except you know a few good men are trying to save the day. But with less story and instead of Germans or Japanese for hostiles we get hordes of vengeful aliens their monstrous UFOs choking the L.A. skies like rush hour on the 405. Chris Bertolinis script is totally predictable from the first few moments when Eckharts Marine staff sergeant signs his discharge papers only to have them put on hold. Its not really about acting either though Eckhart does his best to play the hero lead his little band of brothers (and a sister) save some civilians including kids in case the stakes werent high enough while delivering stagy lines in a teeth-clenching growl ""Retreat? Hell. We just got here."" Nope ""Battle Los Angeles"" is all about the boom-boom as Santa Monica by way of Baton Rouge La. where the movie was actually shot is reduced to rubble. But as the title suggests L.A. is on the firing line so the citys skyline is blown to bits. Burning broken blackened bits. So if thats what youre in the mood for that is what the film delivers endlessly but in that cheesy-campy way that can make a bad movie good fun. Over time South African director Liebesmans blood lust has progressed from 2006s ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning"" through ""The Killing Room"" in 2009. With ""Battle"" hes into spilling it less and always in a patriotic fervor with help from an orchestral Boston Pops on the Fourth of July-styled score from Brian Tyler. Hoo-rah. But honestly the movie such as it is belongs as much to visual effects supervisor Everett Burrell as anyone due to the aforementioned burning blackened bits and those intergalactic intruders. Let me back up for a minute. The story opens with an unknown military force and its complicated-looking flying battleships strafing most of the big cities around the world for unknown reasons. It turns out they are aliens in search of water. But before we know what or who the U.S. military is mobilized civilians are evacuated and the battles begin. The alien forces for thats what all the hoo-ha is all about are a wild bunch. They come roaring in in their big black Transformers-like machines wrecking mayhem. Yet on the ground they look silvery and slim kind of stylish prissing their way through all the mess theyve made as though they dont want to get their silver shoes dirty. On the inside its another matter. They are absolutely disgusting blobs of really gross stuff. Staff Sergeant (because thats all they call Eckhart) stabs one for about 10 minutes before letting a civilian a veterinarian played by Bridget Moynahan dig around in the gooey guts so that they can find and destroy whatever passes for an alien heart. (Other key players include Michelle Rodriguez Ramon Rodriguez Ne-Yo and Michael PeA+-a). All of this unfolds in either headache-inducing shaky camera close-ups or long shots of explosions. Director of photography Lukas Ettlin was the one in charge of trying to shoot everything from the Marines point of view thus the shake rattle and roll of battle extends to everyone watching. The long shots are better and for a while it can be fun to watch things get blown up and burned. But at some point as another one bites the dust you realize it doesnt matter much whether its one of theirs or ours and you cant help but wish there had been a lot more heart in this Marines story. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review 13 AssassinsApril 28 2011Movie review Evangelion 2.0 You Can (Not) AdvanceJanuary 20 2011Visual effects gurus Colin and Greg Strause take Skyline...November 7 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTLos AngelesLos_angelesCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-battle-la-20110311,0,4204725.story",200,battlelosangeles12,battlelosangeles,latimes

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Somewhere in the closing credits for ""Battle Los Angeles"" there should be a nod to the smithereens wrangler on the production staff. The film shoots shrapnel airborne scrap metal glowing tracer rounds and miscellaneous projectile rubble at cowering audiences like an artillery barrage. Well what did you suppose the movie was going to be? When you sign on for a grim gritty tour with U.S. Marines in urban warfare against fiendish aliens you will not get an afternoon at the flower show. The film constructed by people of serious talent is designed to put you through the wringer and thats exactly what it does. This is a total war scenario people. Man up or stand back. Hoo-rah When a ""meteorite swarm"" splashing into the Pacific reveals itself as an interplanetary strike force Santa Monica Beach becomes D-Day Normandy. News reports on TV give us blurry indistinct images of the hostiles; apparently HD broadcasting is the first casualty. After swift setup the film becomes a big-screen version of first-person combat video games like Halo or Quake. Marines penetrate the devastated city on a mission of mercy to evacuate civilians (or ""evac"" as the Tom Clancy-esque dialogue has it). The rampaging aliens -- imagine 6-foot squids wearing suits of armor -- and heroic Marines meet with seat-squirmingly gruesome results. Which is not to say the films convulsive violence is an altogether unpleasant experience. War is hell but it has a thrilling evil beauty and this movie gives us an eyeful. ""Id go to hell and back for you"" says Staff Sgt. Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) to buck up his callow indecisive lieutenant. The moviemakers grab us by the lapels and haul us through every bullet-pocked perilous inch of that terrain. Once in their grip we have neither the will nor the wish to tear ourselves away. Eckharts character is a decorated Iraq vet who wants out when his current tour ends. He lost a lot of good men over there in a no-win situation. Hes kind to frightened little kids. And there ends his characterization more or less. The script individualizes its characters with telegraphic brevity. Theres Marine Whos Engaged Marine Whos Got a Psych File Marine From Overseas -- all the usual suspects. Theres even our old friend Tough Ethnic Military Woman played by -- who else? -- Michelle Rodriguez. These lightly sketched personalities are sufficient for the actors to work effectively and to tweak our sympathies as they are blown away one and two at a time. Eckhart can do more with sad eyes than most performers could do with a 10-page monologue. His gung-ho performance is the best military recruitment ad since ""Top Gun."" Duck down in your seat and hold on tight its one hell of a ride. BATTLE LOS ANGELES  out of 4 stars Rated PG-13 for sustained and intense sequences of war violence and destruction and for language.

Thats easy Make aliens the enemy -- faceless marauders from another planet who can be shot maimed and blowed up good without anyone feeling their humanity is being misrepresented. They have no humanity so git them boogers.""Battle Los Angeles takes this notion and runs like hell dodging and weaving through as much extraterrestrial incoming as digital effects will allow while joyfully embracing every war-movie cliche known to man. Written by Chris Bertolini (""The Generals Daughter) and directed by Jonathan Liebesman its a loud frenetic viscerally gripping two-hour tour of duty that mostly plays fair by the rules of the genre and mostly avoids macho posturing. This is what a grunts-eye-view of alien invasion looks like.So much so that the heros a Marine staff sergeant Nantz played by Aaron Eckhart with the bone-deep weariness of a man who has lost too many men in Iraq. Aside from its basic premise -- alien warships are plummeting to Earth and attacking 23 major cities with maximum firepower right now -- ""Battle Los Angeles takes place in a recognizable post-9/11 military culture. Losses have hit home and exhaustion is physical psychological moral. The movie then proceeds to people that landscape with characters straight out of a World War II movie.Theres the Kid of course a downy-cheeked sharpshooter named Lenihan (Noel Fisher). Theres Brooklyn although hes called Stavrou (Gino Anthony Pesi) and hes from New Jersey; no matter he can hot-wire a bus in seconds. Theres the Hispanic class clown (Neil Brown Jr.) the scaredy-cat (Ramp;B singer Ne-Yo) the brooder (Cory Hardrict) who cant forgive the sergeant for losing his brother overseas. Doc? Check a Nigerian medical corpsman played by Adetokumboh MCormack. The callow second lieutenant (Ramon Rodriguez) fresh from Officer Training School and in over his head? Hes here. Tex? Yep a lance corporal (Taylor Handley) whos the soft-spoken backbone of the team. All present and accounted for.This being the modern military there has to be a ballsy female soldier and this being a modern war movie she has to be played by Michelle Rodriguez re-upping for a post-""Avatar tour as the tech sergeant the squadron comes across while struggling to get to a Santa Monica police station where civilians are holed up. (So yes theres a bit of ""Assault on Precinct 13 in this movies DNA too. Not that thats a bad thing.) One of those civilians is the capable Michele (Bridget Moynahan) and one of the few unintentional laughs in ""Battle Los Angeles comes when the Marines have to quickly autopsy a fallen alien and she volunteers her services -- as a veterinarian.Mostly the movie moves too fast for comedy or character drama although there are flickers of a romantic bond between the staff sergeant and the lady vet and the moment comes as it must when the grizzled Nantz has to pull his squadron together with an inspirational battlefield speech. At the movies weakest you sense the filmmakers standing just off-camera with a punch list and a map. Which way to Pork Chop Hill?When the film is at its strongest you get caught up in an elemental game of strategy and survival abetted by frighteningly believable digital effects and a hectic street-level realism. ""Battle Los Angeles toys with audiences fears of It Happening Here and splits the difference between unthinkable collateral damage (""Were leveling Santa Monica Nantz is warned early on) and reassuring John Wayne-style heroics. The Duke is not only name-checked in passing but Eckhart (whos excellent) even bears a squinty resemblance by the final scenes.In all its a solid B movie with A-level ordnance. ""Battle Los Angeles only oversteps its bounds when you sense it trying to be the ""Saving Private Ryan of alien invasion flicks the opening assault on the beaches (this time were playing defense) a squadron crossing the killing fields on a rescue mission the dwindling number of men. The very notion of a film that honored real struggle and sacrifice getting remulched for fantasy-combat purposes sticks in ones craw and the further back you stand the more ""Battle Los Angeles looks like winnable boo-ya make-believe for audiences worn out by unending current events.

Share Tweet The pitch for Battle Los Angeles must have sounded great Black Hawk Down meets Independence Day an alien invasion told from a grunts-eye view. Here again elite soldiers off swarms of insurgent warriors but not on the streets of Mogadishu in the familiar pockets of L.A. sprawl which are rendered like the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic Call Of Duty. But Black Hawk Down had the advantage of drawing on a real event meticulously recounted in Mark Bowdens book and it earns the gravitas imbued on the fighters and their core values. By contrast Battle Los Angeles draws entirely on cliches cliches about a hero about to retire and in need of redemption cliches about the bonds between granite-cut men cliches in every speech and ""Dont you die on me""-type sentiment. And theyre all shouted at top volume. Though a little time is allotted for perfunctory character development Battle Los Angeles throws the audience right into an alien invasion as its happening. Nothing is known about where the aliens come from what they want or even how to kill them and what little intrigue the film generates comes from ordinary soldiers trying to figure out the answers to these questions. Mere weeks away from resigning from the service after 20 years Aaron Eckhart carries the baggage of losing men in a failed mission in the Middle East. The alien invasion gives him one last shot to lead an isolated platoon into battle against an enemy that has swiftly obliterated human air and ground forces in L.A. and other cities around the world. Battle Los Angeles got some press last year when Colin and Greg Strause--the sibling team whose company Hydraulx was hired to do the effects--were accused of appropriating materials for their inexpensive science-fiction movie Skyline and rushing it into theaters first. If thats true we now have two generic movies for the price of one and a half. Every element of Battle Los Angeles is borrowed from a superior source the creature designs (District 9 meets War Of The Worlds) the shaky-cam ""immediacy"" (the last two Bourne movies) even Michelle Rodriguezs character (Aliens nearly every other Michelle Rodriguez performance). Its loud relentless and difficult to endure capturing the experience of ground-level alien warfare with woeful verisimilitude.

Camouflaged as meteor showers armored aliens invade Earth to suck dry its natural resources.Who you gonna call? The Marines of course.The filmmakers strictly observe the movie law that just as hes mothballing his uniform a short-timer gets redeployed.On the very day that he completes the paperwork for retirement Staff Sgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhardt) still mourning the loss of men in Afghanistan is in a platoon helicoptered into the City of Angels to reclaim Santa Monica from interplanetary devils attacking port cities around the globe.His unit is peopled by the usual prospects. Theres the corporal (Ne-Yo) about to get married the private (Noel Fisher) whos never been in a battle or with a woman and the second lieutenant (Ramon Rodriguez) untested in combat and an expectant father. Naturally one of the men in the platoon (Cory Hardrict) is the brother of one of the leathernecks that Nantz lost.Thus Nantz has to battle the aliens while fighting for the platoons respect and coaching the second lieutenant.The mission seems as simple as a video-game objective Rescue civilians stranded at a police station and bring them back to base before the U.S. bombs Santa Monica to sweep the coast of these seemingly invincible invaders.(If the geography looks not at all like Los Angeles thats because director Jonathan Liebesman shot it in Louisiana.)But the enemy is much cannier about disabling Earths weapons than vice versa.As a narrative the cartoonish Battle Los Angeles makes the cartoonish Independence Day look as nuanced as Saving Private Ryan. It works as a film diversion because of Eckhardts unwaveringly earnest and resolute performance. Her fans (I am one) will cheer the presence of Michelle Rodriguez perhaps the only Hollywood actress who looks plausible in military uniform.It is a little too slippery to work as an allegory. Are we to take it that the aliens represent earthlings who colonize the Middle East and Africa in order to make off with the regions natural resources? That this is a cautionary tale about any people who would wage war in order to win the spoils of oil and water? Your guess is as good as mine.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Cliches abound but Battle Los Angeles prevails - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Cliches abound but Battle Los Angeles prevailsBattle Los Angeles a 3 starsMarch 10 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticL.A. gets attacked by aliens in a scene from ""Battle Los Angeles.""Most everything about ""Battle Los Angeles"" is either derivative or a lie including its top-line credit that reads ""Columbia Pictures presents in association with Relativity Media an Original Film production."" Original its not. Exciting it is. This jacked-up B-movie hybrid of ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""War of the Worlds"" is a modest but crafty triumph of tension over good sense and cliche.If you had told me yesterday that Id be recommending a movie -- any movie -- in which the hero tells a preteen boy ""I need you to be brave for me...I need you to be my little Marine"" Id have made you watch ""The Green Berets"" for your insolence. Yet here we are and here I am recommending it. A surprising percentage of ""Battle Los Angeles"" is swift and compellingly chaotic. Its also pretty sharp in its depiction of how a small group of Marines and a small group of civilians under attack from a newfound enemy might actually threaten to unravel under duress.Exposition? There is none. Aliens attack Earth at various points along various coastlines. They need water and lots of it apparently to power their machinery and themselves. (They like to stay hydrated as does everyone else in LA.) On the verge of retirement -- yes that old story -- the staff sergeant played by Aaron Eckhart must lead the charge and find a way to defeat these slimy heavy-artillery-bearing jerks.He does. (Retroactive spoiler alert.) Whats refreshing about ""Battle Los Angeles"" is that for a good while before the rah-rah stuff toward the end the cumulative effects of all the carnage actually seem to affect the characters. Eckhart isnt playing some sort of superhuman action toy; none too subtly screenwriter Chris Bertolini makes Nantz a stoic with secrets having recently come off a rough tour of duty in Iraq where he lost men in combat. The movies designed as apolitical payback for our fighting forces recent and ongoing battles in the Middle East. And at heart yes its a recruitment reel for the Marines.Yet ""Battle Los Angeles"" doesnt embrace the drooling fantasy militarism you find in Michael Bays ""Transformers"" pictures for example. The focus of the story here is gratifyingly narrow Its about a handful of people trying to get a handful of blocks to a safe zone on the west side of LA and not get killed in the process. The saving-the-world part is almost an afterthought.Jonathan Liebesman directed it in a style that can be described as faux-documentary and very heavy on the close-ups. It wont kill him in future projects to discover the value of an occasional medium- or long-shot and of sustaining that shot more than 2.4 seconds. But the action remains scarily lucid under fire braking just short of relentlessness. I suppose my tolerance and even enjoyment of the typical Roland Emmerich cheeseball of the ""Independence Day"" and ""2012"" variety explains why I went with this far less grandiose diversion. LA always seems to be taking it in the shorts from something or other. I mean ""Skyline"" just came and went. In my moviegoing minds eye the city has only now just recovered from ""Earthquake"" in Sensurround. Aliens might I suggest Wisconsin Dells for your next visit?mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for sustained and intense sequences of war violence and destruction and for language)Cast Aaron Eckhart (Marine Staff Sgt.

JOHNSON  Post-Dispatch Pop Music Critic  kjohnsonpost-dispatch.com  314-340-8191 Mar 10 2011 (...) Richard Cartwright Aaron Eckhart in ""Battle Los Angeles"" (Columbia Pictures-Sony) Black Hawk Down"" meets ""District 9"" meets ""Independence Day"" meets ""Cloverfield"" in the new alien invasion thriller ""Battle Los Angeles."" The so-so film isnt nearly as good as any of the movies that may have inspired it or even its own knockout trailer.The big-budget flick which also recalls last years panned ""Skyline"" opens in midchaos with the Santa Monica area getting blown to fiery pieces by what looks like falling meteors.After a few minutes of this mayhem the film jumps back 24 hours so we can get to know the members of Marine Staff Sgt. Michael Nantzs (Aaron Eckhart) platoon a generally nice group including 2nd Lt. William Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez) Cpl. Kevin Harris (Ramp;B singer Ne-Yo) Cpl. Jason Lockett (Cory Hardrict) Cpl. Nick Stavrou (Gino Anthony Pesi) and medic Jibril Adukwu (Adetokumboh MCormack). After quickly glimpsing their lives over several quiet scenes (one is engaged another Skypes with his sister etc.) the sky begins raining meteors and the men are called into action to combat this ""infestation of God knows what"" as one character says.Along the way they pick up civilians Michele (Bridget Moynahan) and Joe (Michael Pena) and Air Force Tech. Sgt. Elena Santos (Michelle Rodriguez in her usual tough girl role).What theyre dealing with are countless aliens -- tall leggy and encased in metal to shield their messy insides -- who are mining Earth for its resources. Countless shootouts ensue with lots of ducking and dodging as the Marines fight to protect and survive.Nothing about it it feels fresh. In the midst of it all Eckharts Nantz manages to throw in an overly scripted inspirational speech some obvious rah-rah while the soundtrack swells. The only thing more annoying is Rodriguezs Santos screaming ""Take that"" after destroying an alien. Effort is made to give each of these characters a face and life but once theyre in their helmets and camouflage it doesnt matter. Save for Eckhart and Ne-Yo who oddly never loses his characters oversize black glasses the actors are a bit anonymous.Though beautifully shot by director Jonathan Liebesman (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning"") with great special effects and set design this battle has already been fought bigger and better.""Battle Los Angeles"" will get you through the weekend if youre looking for a loud popcorn movie with lots of bang but not much else.Two stars (out of four)  What ""Battle Los Angeles""  Rating PG-13  Run time 154  Content Sustained and intense sequences of war violence and destruction and language Videos Watch a trailer for Battle Los Angeles Mar 9 2011 (...)

Theyve made it feel as if old-fashioned movie creatures were looming right up into our reality. Its a catchy technique but in the paramilitary alien-invasion head-cruncher Battle Los Angeles the digital-era clutter serves a different and much lower purpose Its basically there to cover up the fact that except for the relentless jittery way that the film has been photographed theres nothing of interest going on in it. Its all fractious guerrilla-newsreel ""style"" masquerading a void. Battle Los Angeles is an apocalyptic action casserole that mixes together elements of War of the Worlds (both versions) Aliens Starship Troopers Independence Day D9 and Earthquake. Yet it makes every one of those films look like a study in dramatic nuance. In theory Battle Los Angeles sounds like fun but in execution its a shapeless and impersonal dud in which the extraterrestrial invaders glimpsed mostly from afar generate so little visual interest that it almost doesnt matter whether youre watching a bigheaded droid or a circular warship that comes apart in the air like the pieces of a pie. They all blend together into the same faceless hurtling flame-throwing enemy The metal from another planet At one point a crew of Marines led by the granite-jawed Aaron Eckhart wounds and captures one of the robot-armed extraterrestrials that have come to Earth to wipe out the human race. (L.A. is the last front in the alien-vs.-Earth war but Ill keep their motive a secret.) As the alien lies there the Marines poke and prod its squishy insides (the usual gelatinous mess of weird organs and gooey membrane) until they figure out how exactly to kill it with a gunshot to the right of the heart. Thats a standard horror-movie ploy derived from the moment in Night of the Living Dead when the besieged victims hit upon their survival strategy ""Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul."" Except that Battle Los Angeles establishes this point and then does almost nothing with it. And thats the way the whole movie works. It creates token tidbits of drama that are just filler in between endless repetitive scenes of haphazard firepower. The director Jonathan Liebesman certainly works on a grand scale creating an epic landscape of smoke rubble and chaos. (If there were an Oscar for Best Debris this movie would take it.) Yet he doesnt make the attack on the planet and on Los Angeles in particular feel like a cool trashing of civilization. The way he shoots L.A. it looks like a pile of trashed concrete before the aliens even get there. Battle Los Angeles is so inept its exhausting. Watching it is like playing a videogame without rules.

Battle Los Angeles (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Battle Los Angeles (PG-13) The latest invasion of Earth by aliens isnt memorable but you wont be bored. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald3/10/2011 Editor rating 2.5 As alien invasions go Battle Los Angeles falls squarely in the middle of the pack. Its not so goofy as Independence Day not so terrifying as War of the Worlds and it utterly lacks the imagination and emotional resonance of District 9. It is however a solid popcorn movie with plenty of action explosions and low-key mayhem unlikely to scar even the most fragile of psyches. Its the sort of film thats entertaining while youre in the theater even though youll probably have forgotten it by the time youve reached your front door. South African director Jonathan Liebesman is responsible for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning and the forgotten but truly terrible Darkness Falls about a demonic Tooth Fairy who terrorizes a small town presumably forcing the populace into buying new crowns without insurance. Happily Liebesman has stepped up his game here even if hes swiped bits and pieces from other films. Like all good military movie heroes Staff Sgt. Michael Nance (Aaron Eckhart) lugs around plenty of combat baggage. In his last harrowing tour of Afghanistan he was blamed for the deaths of the rest of his platoon. Naturally he has just signed his retirement papers but is called almost immediately back to work. A cluster of meteors has been spotted heading for Earth and some are going to smash into the California coast so the military needs all hands to evacuate residents. The men under Nances makeshift command arent particularly happy about getting stuck with him but they have bigger problems. The meteors arent rocks. Theyre space ships full of well-armed colonizing extraterrestrials and pretty soon L.A. is facing massive destruction. Liebesman shoots the action from a grunts-eye view as his Marines -- led by that other stock war character the well-educated officer (Ramon Rodriguez) whos a stand-up guy but naive in the strategies of physical engagement -- attempt to rescue a few stranded civilians and fend off their powerful adversaries. The action is reminiscent of a video game with chaotic fire fights and lots of yelling. Theres no real sense of loss as characters die; the script makes a token attempt to differentiate among the Marines but the best I can make out theres the virgin the guy whos about to get married (Ne-Yo) and Michelle Rodriguez (Avatar) who turns up as a tech-savvy soldier of another company. Otherwise theyre fairly interchangeable. The aliens are an unimpressive lot too though we dont see much of them until Nance grabs one of the wounded and performs a gross and impromptu dissection to find out how to kill them. Turns out you dont need to do anything special a bullet to the heart area works just fine. The same could be said for Battle Los Angeles. Its not special but it doesnt have to be.

(Cartwright/AP) Joe Neumaier Thursday March 10 2011 400 AM Title Battle Los Angeles With Aaron Eckhart Michelle Rodriguez. Aliens attack L.A; humans battle back. Director Jonathan Liebesman (156). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters.""Aliens? Thats not possible right?"" exclaims one shocked jarhead in ""Battle Los Angeles."" Sadly it is soldier -- and unlike other alien-themed movies coming this week and next this one isnt original or even bearable.By its thudding end audiences may wish they could be zapped from the theater to escape the buzzing in their ears.A war of the worlds can be the perfect escapist movie -- what will the intergalactic SOBs look like what do they want how will we take em down? But ""Battle L.A."" -- no need for plot description its right there in the title -- is simply a big video game (of course a gaming tie-in is in stores now). The aliens need water so they land off the coast of the obligatory cities (Washington Paris blah blah blah). Silly Earthlings assume those are meteors heading our way. Until drone ships start blasting L.A. leaving the military no choice but to start the bombing in five minutes.Before we drop the Big One though the Marines under the command of Sergeant Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) are the first to land in the ET zone which no longer means just Charlie Sheen headlines. ""Those bombs will level Santa Monica sir"" says a shocked corporal. No more rollerbladers musclemen or indie movie award shows. Society will just have to rebuild.Soon feisty leatherneck Michelle Rodriguez shows up looking like shes wondering why they just couldnt have used her ""Avatar"" outtakes for this yet all weve seen of the space invaders is a brief glimpse of human-size monsters in metal firing laser blasts. Did they plan to have any aliens in their alien film to paraphrase Jeff Goldblum in a movie that wasnt ""Independence Day"" which now that weve mentioned it is a better movie.Thats because ""Independence Day"" was a great ride with kicky performances and a payoff. This movie -- like ""Skyline"" earlier this year -- is a slow trudge. It rushes from one La-La Land firefight to the next its people a blur of barking jarheads its camerawork jumpy its soundtrack full of those loud industrial honks that signal We Are Not Alone. When the mothership finally arrives its a clinking clanking clattering collection of metallic parts as if Fred Sanfords junkyard suddenly became airborne.If the filmmakers intended ""The Hurt Locker"" with little green men it blew up in their face.

"Battle Los Angeles Army of one | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBattle Los Angeles Army of oneSkipping brekkie to kick alien butt is the sole novel lesson of Battle Los Angeles a rote sci-fi actioner that summons John Waynes ghost too literally and too often.Aaron Eckhart gets plenty of screen time as aging tough Marine Michael Nantz in Battle Los Angeles  (Richard Cartwright)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 10 2011 Battle Los Angeles (out of 4) Starring Aaron Eckhart Michelle Rodriguez Ne-Yo and Bridget Moynahan. Directed by Jonathan Liebesman. 115 minutes. Opens March 11 at major theatres. 14A Breakfast is for wimps. While the rest of humanity fusses with the toaster settings on their Eggos Staff-Sgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) and his fellow Marines face down space invaders with empty bellies and clear hearts. How are you gonna eat E.T. for lunch son if youre still standing in the morning chow line? This may not be the most important lesson of Battle Los Angeles but its the most novel one in a rote sci-fi actioner that summons John Waynes squinty ghost too bluntly and too often. Eckharts Nantz is the Dukes surrogate a 40something career Marine ready to hang up his dog tags. Seems he has a bad case of survivor guilt having returned from too many fights with too few friends. ""A Marines got a shelf life you know"" he tells his commanding officer. No sooner do these words leave his piehole when aliens not related to Charlie Sheen but flying saucers borrowed from the District 9 gang begin attacking. Nantzs country and his planet is calling him. Whats a good Marine to do except man up stare down and commence firing? Hes saddled with a sad group of fighting men (and one woman) as well as an abysmal script by Christopher Bertolini and upchuck-inducing direction by Jonathan Liebesman (Darkness Falls). On all sides of the battle-savvy Nantz are frightened resentful and shell-shocked rookies who seem more inclined to cry ""Mama"" than ""Hoo-rah"" when Marvin the Martian starts blasting. Which Marvin surely does although it takes until the 45-minute mark until we get a good look at him and his cronies who resemble gangly versions of the Star Wars storm troopers. Since theyre space aliens its okay to be as racist as you want towards them. Theyve come for our water and theyre sucking it out of our sewer systems. Those filthy savages are drinking toilet water Unlike most alien invasion flicks where the Marines are defeated at the outset leaving the lone wacky scientist to save the day this is a boots-on-the-ground battle film thats almost completely free of eggheads. Its been shot digitally with what seems like one completely unhinged camera the aliens apparently having knocked out our Steadicam technology. Nantzs platoon which includes rapper Ne-Yo and Avatar ass-kicker Michelle Rodriguez is tasked with clearing humans from the streets and beaches of Santa Monica (the film should actually be titled Battle Santa Monica) before Uncle Sam commences with the heavy artillery. ""Were levelling Santa Monica sir?"" asks one naive grunt. Yes son but sadly not the Santa Monica Pier production budgets being tight and all. The Marines have three hours to get er done not a lot of time when youre dealing with advanced alien weaponry and inconvenient humans the latter including a comely veterinarian (Bridget Moynahan) and a couple of cute kids. But only Nantz really has the gung-ho spirit the Dukes penchant for doing things his own way and most important the screen time that nobody else gets. Hes even willing to perform messy autopsies on alien bodies where he quite literally discovers that their hearts are not in the right places. Marvin and his pals cease fire long enough for the humans to make meaningful speeches about their lives and how Marines never give up etc. Then the blasting resumes. Me I would rather have enjoyed a big breakfast. Pass the syrup would you?

For those who get lumps in their throats each time a Marine shouts ""HOO-rah"" ""Battle Los Angeles"" brims with acts of martial derring-do. Indeed one brave bordering-on-crazy feat is dubbed ""some real John Wayne shit"" which is accurate especially if the Duke had to save Santa Monica (and by extension Earth) from a murkily shot poorly explained alien invasion. Although Aaron Eckhart and a slick trailer might inspire some curiosity among those not normally drawn to such mind-numbing fare longer-term prospects appear limited to those who like their movies stupid and very very loud. Mostly this is the cinematic equivalent of a first-person shooter game one where the Marines possess only slightly more personality than the faceless invaders. Director Jonathan Liebesman (who helmed ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning"") and writer Chris Bertolini squander only the barest amount of time necessary before initiating their urban-renewal project as what are presumably meteor showers turn out to be an alien attack. Crashing into the Pacific Ocean Cylon-like thingamajigs (which is about all you see of them for most of the movie) emerge to begin indiscriminately eradicating the human population in whats described in military-speak as a ""campaign of rapid dominance."" Before the hullaballoo starts Staff Sgt. Nantz (Eckhart) is ready to quit having had a bad experience on an earlier assignment. Now however its save-the-world time as his unit launches a rescue mission to try to stop a planned aerial bombardment (from Lincoln Boulevard to the ocean were told) placing a ticking clock on the proceedings. On the plus side if you can survive the merciless killing machines traffic in that usually congested part of town is a relative breeze. In addition to Nantzs almost wholly nondescript companions the Marines pick up a few surviving grunts (Michelle Rodriguez) and civilians (Michael Pena Bridget Moynahan) along the way including a couple of understandably terrified kids. Yet no matter how much Brian Tylers score swells -- and it does so early and often -- the action is seldom stirring enough to merit those crescendos. ""Battle Los Angeles"" employs an old trick of tackling a global threat at a micro level (see ""Signs"" or the most recent ""War of the Worlds"") capturing the mysterious extraterrestrials in jerky bursts of chaotic action relentlessly played at an ear-splitting din. Alas the visuals are mostly a bust owing a small debt to ""District 9"" but too often shot through a dense pea-soup fog that consistently obscures whats firing back at our intrepid heroes. Then again murkiness is also the strategy employed by the plot which has no patience for the ""why"" of anything. Eckhart doesnt do many movies in this vein but his square-jawed earnestness is no match for the jargon-heavy dialogue which lets up only briefly for clunky rally-the-troops speechmaking. Of course the location ensures these noble warriors fight on behalf of the U.S. but as with the aliens in ""V"" were told these visitors have landed at strategic metropolises around the planet. Unabashed patriotism is usually a pretty safe bet but ""Battle Los Angeles"" never gets beyond the platitudes. As for making an audience care about what happens when the smoke clears thats the sort of uphill battle even John Wayne would be hard-pressed to win.

TWITTER Aaron Eckhart stars as the hero-apparent in director Jonathan Liesbesmanas new movie about an alien attack on Earth opening Friday. The streets of Santa Monica will have to be added to the halls of Montezuma and the shores of Tripoli in the annals of Marine Corps lore according to Battle Los Angeles a combat picture so gung ho that it qualifies as The Green Berets of sci-fi war films. An effects-laden docu-drama-style action fantasy in which a few stealthy American soldiers take everything some fearsome alien invaders can throw at them this on-the-cheap mash-up of Black Hawk Down and War of the Worlds promises a lot more than it delivers despite a few spectacular shots of massive destruction; the deadening and sometimes laughable litany of shouted military-style dialogue eventually pummels into submission any hope for fresh creative angles on this well-worn format. Good young male-driven opening weekend business looks to drop off rapidly. Director Jonathan Liebesman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning) must have thought that shooting the whole film from a shaky constantly readjusting camera perspective would give it the immediacy of you-are-there documentary coverage; instead it makes it look like an affected TV show provoking the nagging urge to fast-forward through all the speeches to get to the good parts. The cliches are so abundant in the script by Chris Bertolini (The Generals Daughter) and the rah-rah stuff is delivered with such straight faces that with just a slight adjustment in tone Battle Los Angeles (the title of which features no punctuation onscreen) could stand as an effective parody of alien visitation pictures. If Mystery Science Theater 3000 was still around the gang would want to put this one in its sights pronto. ""Aliens? Thats not possible right?"" trembles a green young Marine when the evidence on television shows very much to the contrary. When Los Angeles joins many other world cities in being bombarded by ""meteors"" of unknown origin choppers full of Camp Pendleton Marines embark for Santa Monica where beachfront property has suddenly plunged in value thanks to Transformer-like marauders possessed of devastating artillery power. Although only a staff sergeant whos just announced his intention to retire grizzled Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) is positioned as the leader and hero-apparent of a rainbow-coalition platoon that must make its way through rubble from the forward operating base at Santa Monica Airport to a police station on 10th Street in order to rescue some civilians. And theyve only got three hours to do it as a big bomb will then be dropped. From this point on much of the action is confined to dark cramped indoor quarters marked by innumerable shots designed to create fear of what might be around the next corner or behind a door. This is when you realize that the film is abjectly failing to generate any genuine suspense mystery or awe and instead is saddling itself with inane cliches involving saving a couple of little kids and ramming home respect for the military (""Marines dont quit"") as if courage and honor are going to have any effect on mechanized aliens of infinitely greater technical sophistication. Dumb luck on the other hand can come in real handy. As in countless prior combat unit movies every grunt is bestowed with one identifying trait (here theres a virgin a Nigerian doctor and a by-the-book lieutenant whos never led men before among others) but it hardly makes any difference as the dialogue is scarcely differentiated and theyre mostly just alien bait anyway. Ramon Rodriguez as the insecure tyro officer and Michelle Rodriguez as a more than secure Air Force tech sergeant who turns up part-way through get more screen time than the rest but theres a sense that the latter and Eckhart are prevented from fully cashing in their hard-ass characterizations by the PG-13 restraint on too many dirty words. To be sure there are some impressive individual moments nearly all of them briefly revealed looks at the devastation wrought by the relentless aliens towering metal-clad warriors that make funny little electronic gurgling noises when not fighting. If the film possessed any resonance or sense of poetry at all the sight of the vicinity of Lincoln Blvd. and the 10 Freeway as a war zone might sting with Iraq-comes-to-California-like reverberations. But as it is it cant even hold a candle to similar scenes of coastal devastation in the recent 2012. Partly shot in Louisiana the picture is further weighed down by a bombastic musical score.

"Battle Los Angeles | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; battle-los-angeles ) Battle Los Angeles (United States 2011) March 09 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Perhaps its a backhanded compliment to acknowledge that as would-be ""event"" films about alien invasions go Battle Los Angeles is superior to both Independence Day and Skyline. Nevertheless the movie is likely to miss the mark for anyone in search of something more than a noisy kinetic way to spend a couple of hours. Of the roughly 110 minutes of non-credits screen time accorded to the story about 90 of those are taken up by a ""you are there"" perspective of firefights with aliens. That means a lot of shooting enough explosions to make Michael Bay happy and a fair amount of dying. It also means confusion resulting from an overreliance on hand-held cameras. If the intent is to convey to the viewer the chaos and disorientation that occurs in the middle of a pitched battle Battle Los Angeles succeeds. If the goal is to unveil a coherent narrative it does not. Watching Battle Los Angeles is akin to observing someone else play a video game with top-notch production values. For a while its fun but immersion is born of involvement. Take away the interactivity and its a considerably less entertaining experience. In that way this movie is a bit of a tease; the viewer is never pulled in the way the filmmakers want him to be. For about 30 minutes - maybe a little more maybe a little less - Battle Los Angeles is fast-paced and energetic but the repetition kills the momentum and by the time all the shooting has come to an end the production has overstayed its welcome. It might be different with well-developed characters or a story that offers more depth or breadth but the movie is predominantly pyrotechnics and as impressive as some of those are they dont warrant two hours worth of screen time. To its credit Battle Los Angeles gets off the ground running. The backstory is conveyed economically and the characters are introduced quickly and cleanly without the soap opera-ish subplots that pollute a lot of disaster movies. Granted clichA(c)s abound but at least we dont have to suffer too much through faux character building. The downside of this is that we never develop much interest in even the most prominent character Sgt. Michael Nantz  who is only marginally more recognizable than anyone else because (a) he has more screen time and (b) hes played by recognizable actor Aaron Eckhart. Beyond Nantz there arent many standout faces. Exceptions include Lt. William Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez) because hes in charge Joe Rincon (Michael Pena) because hes a civilian; and Sgt. Elena Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez) because shes a she. Everyone else blurs together and if this was Star Trek most of them would be wearing red shirts. When one of them is killed were not entirely sure which one he is. Someone should have studied James Camerons Aliens for a primer on how to quickly give personalities to a group of marines in a bad situation. Battle Los Angeles opens with a 20-minute ""prologue"" in which we are informed mostly via TV news reports that a cluster of meteors impacting Earths oceans near populated shore areas are actually extraterrestrial invaders. Their weaponry is superior to ours but they appear to be ground-restricted (no air support). Forward military bases and civilian population centers are quickly overrun. In Los Angeles Santa Monica is being sacrificed. The air force will begin a barrage of bombing in three hours; a unit led by Lt. Martinez and Sgt. Nantz has that long to get into the contested area rescue survivors taking refuge at a police station and get out. That element of the story takes up more than half the running length and unfolds much like a ""quest"" or ""mission"" in a video game. With the exception of the occasional exposition-laden scene there isnt much dialogue which is fortunate considering how cheesy some of the lines are. The actors are all surprisingly good in these undemanding roles. Eckhart brings a gruff likability to his part and there are times when he almost transcends the one-dimensionality of his character. None of the other actors are as successful in imbuing underwritten individuals with more than a scintilla of humanity but they try rather than merely sleepwalking through the part on the way to cashing their paychecks. The special effects arent as numerous or omnipresent as one might expect from an alien invasion motion picture. For the most part the extraterrestrials are seen in the distance silhouetted against the sky as they attack from the high ground. The use of shaky handheld cameras allows the filmmakers to be less precise during action scenes than they would have to be if events were being recorded using a steadycam. This is director Jonathan Liebsmans first big budget feature although he has titles like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning and The Killing Room on his resume. Whatever his previous endeavors might have taught him one unlearned lesson is that the path to sustained suspense lies in putting a well-developed character in harms way. No one in this film comes close to being partially developed let alone ""well-developed"" so the relentless non-stop firefights eventually grow tiresome. Still for those who are more interested in cinema thats purely visceral and visually energetic (albeit chaotic) theres some value in Battle Los Angeles. More importantly it isnt as insulting as Skyline. Many of its lapses are consistent with genre-wide problems where big concepts can have difficulty making the transition into strong screenplays. As alien invasion motion pictures go this is a minor effort and its release in late winter when multiplex audiences are only beginning to come out of hibernation is well-timed. Its not a summer blockbuster but neither is it the complete garbage movie-goers expect in January and February.

Called into duty after news reports of extraterrestrial warfare devour the airwaves a John Wayne-type staff sergeant (Aaron Eckhart)--on the eve of retirement and in search of redemption--leads a Marine squad into laser-demolished downtown L.A. to evacuate civilians. As they proceed block by invader-infested block their mission suggests Iraq/Afghanistan parallels that are overwhelmed by bludgeoning cacophony (including a few brumfs borrowed from Inception) and visual incoherence. Matching the indistinctness of the human protagonists whose pre-conflict intros fail to establish empathy for their future up-a-creek circumstances the films mushroom-headed bio-mech invaders prove a featureless bunch out to steal the planets water supply. Not a single arresting image is found amid the sci-fi rubble though unintentional laughs eventually arrive courtesy of a cornball motivational speech by Eckharts hero that he then immediately dismisses with ""None of that matters right now."" Ultimately its not clear whats more nauseating the Tilt-a-Wheel cinematography the shameless second-act bid for weepy-child bathos or the suggestion of an inevitable sequel.

The extraterrestrials are a highly trained fighting force their destructive drone aircraft and heavily armoured infantry wreaking global havoc. With just three hours to go before an air strike destroys Santa Monica veteran Marine staff sergeant Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) and his team must extract some civilians from an abandoned police station and take them to safety.Stunningly shot on celluloid by cinematographer Lukas Ettlin the grainy hand-held images resemble a 12A-rated version of Black Hawk Down but the tone flips between documentary-style authenticity and the adrenaline-junkie excitement of a first-person computer game. The weak link is Christopher Bertolinis script which lumbers the flat military characters with hackneyed dialogue and corny sentimentality. Not even Eckhart can survive such banality and kick-ass specialist Michelle Rodriguez is wasted as sidekick sergeant Elena Santos.

Anyway as a Marine (and from all the movies Ive seen) this is the most accurate depiction of us yet. Needless to say myself and every Marine i know think its great so no offense to civilians but before you go critiquing a military film for its script you should probably know how we talk and act first because its nothing like civilians.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 21 2011MarineFeaturedOk first off the script in this movies is great minus the ""F.O.B"" screw up we say it as a word FOB.

I did eventually get around to see Battle for LA. There was a lot off blown up rubble at the end. If you want to get a lot off old buildings knocked down get the Alien Mutants to do it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 17 2011jim mFeaturedthis movie shot in real time is not short of action and the effects are great. very gung ho and could be used as a us marine recruitment film but not as good as i hoped it would bebut if its nonstop action you want you get it here and worth seeing if you like aliens v earth movies as i do.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 17 2011GSFeaturedTotally forgettable and one of the worst war movies I have sat through.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 16 2011scrumpyjackFeaturedOne of those easy to sum up films. If you have a free ticket unlimited card or a healthy disposable income go see if you like the look of it. If none of the above apply dont. 6/10FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 14 2011edFeaturedI cant remember anything this ""TEAM AMERICA"" since Pearl Harbour.... But nonetheless it was a good action film. I feared all the action would be in the trailers (like the recent SKYLINE) but the action is pretty much non-stop. Cardboard characters. leaden dialogue plot held zero surpirses...but hey I dont mind in this kind of flick. All I need is mayhem and this delivers. An early Hollywood blockbuster (90s style)FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 12 2011IanFeaturedI agree with Mike it starts well but degenerates into cliche land. It is simply Independence Day remixed for the next generation but without the big name actors. Eckhart plays the emotionally wounded vet who is weeks from retirement who takes his trainee squad with a rookie officer to fight the alien enemy. He happens to be leading a man who blames him for his brothers death. Add in Michelle Rodriguez as a token female kick ass air force expert and let the cliches roll. No doubt in the US the target audeince was up at the end shouting ""USA USA"" and running off to the nearest recruitment centre.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 12 2011MikeFeaturedI agree with Nigel Floyd War of the Worlds meets Black Hawk Down meets computer game. This film starts promisingly with good characterisation but once the action starts it all gets a bit schmaltzy with a few well sign-posted tear-jerking moments. A I thought some of the battle scenes were long and despite being close to the end time a number of couples left. ButA this film isnt trying to beA anything other than a 2 star blockbuster. Its very well shot and the CGI is excellent. The sound mixing could be better as the sound of the battle was too dominant for the dialogue to be clearly heard - did Erkhart really shout to his corporal How often do you change the oil in your Morris Minor?A Like choux pastry this film looks great buts a bit empty. Two stars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89545/battle-los-angeles.html,200,battlelosangeles30,battlelosangeles,timeout
