E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Renee Zellweger plays Emily Jenkins a harried social worker in a big city trying to stay on top of her caseload. She lives alone. Each night she drives her Volvo home to her television and her fish tank. As in many other horror movies all is unremarkable until . . .In this case Case 39.Emily and her cop buddy Mike (Ian McShane of ""Sexy Beast) rescue a timid girl (Jodelle Ferland of ""Tideland) from an appalling home life. Lets just say her demented parents think their daughter would make a nice meat loaf.In one of many plot barriers that the stunt car of your disbelief must jump Emily becomes the shell-shocked girls foster mother. Zellweger has already said ""Im not mom material -- her own mom died when she was young -- to which the girl replies ""How do you know if youve never tried? This parental trial run seems to signal a heady theme.But director Christian Alvart (""Antibodies) veers away from it as a series of creepy incidents unfold. For example Emilys co-worker Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover) succumbs to swarms of hornets crawling from his ears mouth and other orifices. People die gruesomely according to their personal ""idea of hell.Is the girl not who she appears to be? Perhaps her name Lilith should have tipped off Zellweger. Or when she says ""I have bad thoughts. Its a bummer when the audience is smarter than the protagonist. After the first reel -- or even watching the trailer -- youll guess the girl is linked to the killings. Which leaves only one mystery How will the devil spawn be stopped?Like ""Rosemarys Baby and the ""Omen and ""Exorcist movies ""Case 39 preys on a fear of parenthood. Does a poisoned psyche prevent you from being a good parent? What if you dont love your children enough? If Lilith wants ice cream for supper you better hop to it.Introduce the supernatural and anything goes. Here everything does. And thats a problem no one can solve.At least it wasnt called ""Case 666.Ethan Gilsdorf can be reached at ethanethangilsdorf.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

After all if hapless childrens social worker Emily (Renee Zellweger) had only bothered to see last summers ""Orphan"" she would have known better than to take in the clearly disturbed 10-year-old girl who proceeds to wreak havoc in ""Case 39."" (That would have been impossible however because the film not screened in advance for critics has been sitting on the shelf since 2006 though it has been released in several overseas territories). Emily who clearly needs to learn how to create boundaries between her professional and personal lives agrees to let Lillith (Jodelle Ferland) stay with her after the little girl survives being nearly burned alive in an oven by her foster parents.(""What the hells the matter with you people?"" asks the hard-boiled detective (Ian McShane) who bursts in on the scene with Emily not unreasonably.) Although seemingly none the worse for wear Lillith soon demonstrates disturbing tendencies ranging from an impressive precociousness -- she pretty much nails child psychologist Doug (Bradley Cooper) when she labels him as ""smug"" and ""facile"" -- to an ability to make everyone around her commit horrifying acts. Clearly the spawn of Satan the little girls powers tend toward the power of suggestion leading to such would-be horrific set pieces as when Coopers shrink apparently is set upon by a swarm of hornets emanating from his own bodily orifices. Advised by her newfound ally Lilliths imprisoned father Emily eventually decides to take action but not before the child has racked up a serious body count. Director Christian Alvart (""Pandorum"") is unable to invest much stylization into the proceedings and Ray Wrights by-the-book screenplay only serves as a reminder of the innumerable demon-child movies that have preceded this one. But then again for todays mostly teenage moviegoers far better examples of the genre like ""The Omen"" must seem as dated as silent films.

"Movie review Case 39 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EmilyMovie review Case 39RenA(c)e Zellweger plays a social worker who tries to save a creepy little girl. Too bad she cant save this lackluster horror flick.October 02 2010|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Early in ""Case 39"" RenA(c)e Zellwegers overburdened social worker Emily complains to her boss ( Adrian Lester) that shes buried in 38 active cases right before he plops the file for you-know-what on her desk. One cant help experiencing the same dread about the exhausting flood of lackluster horror films that swamp our screens and as ""Case 39"" unfolds realizing were enduring one more. It didnt have to be that way considering screenwriter Ray Wrights initially nifty setup. When presented with Lily a pale withdrawn and abused 10-year-old girl (Jodelle Ferland) and her even paler more hollowed-out and sneery parents acting suspiciously whats a do-gooder workaholic like Emily to do? The issue is forced when Mom and Dad shove Lily into the oven one night then try to kill Emily and her cop friend Mike ( Ian McShane) as they intervene just in time. But when Emily decides to take Lily in herself the girls increasingly precocious manner a and some tragic seemingly unexplained events a lead Emily to believe her folks might have been on to something. Lets just say this is not a film for impending foster parents. German horror hack Christian Alvart ( ""Pandorum"") however is hardly an able guardian himself of this material routinely eschewing artful apprehension or terror for empty boo moments like the tight close-up that begs for a sudden pop into the frame of a dog or a friendly face or a knock on a car window. Even more galling is how little mileage Alvart gets out of one of the most reliable of fright flick tropes from ""The Bad Seed"" through ""The Exorcist"" and countless Japanese horror movies the creepy little girl. Its not that Ferland herself isnt effective. Her slightly pulled features can evince a compelling illusion of distortion. Alvart just never builds her into a small-but-dangerous force. Plus Ferland saying unsettling things in her birdlike timbre isnt nearly as effective a tension-rustler when shes sharing the screen with Zellweger whose voice is even wispier and higher-pitched. That said Zellweger certainly tries to inject emotional reality into a scenario that grows increasingly ludicrous. But its a lost cause when the movie around her is as dull as Emilys cubicle. It leaves ""Case 39"" playing like one more piece of multiplex in-box clutter ready for the circular file in our moviegoing consciousness. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSigns of boys abuse missed by L.A.

How about here Case 39 is an aggressively inept demon-seed chiller starring a bunch of grown-ups who should?ve known better. Directed by Christian Alvert (Pandorum) this star-studded mess arrives in theaters bearing the no-confidence stamp ""Not screened in advance for critics."" It also comes with the lingering stench of mothballs because the movie which looks so drab and washed-out you might think it was shot on recycled wax paper instead of celluloid was actually filmed back in 2006. Why did Paramount bother to trot this dusty dud out to multiplexes instead of letting it quietly shuffle off to the DVD remainder bin where it so obviously belongs? Well it turns out that Case 39 managed to scare up a few million bucks in Spain and Mexico (you?re welcome amigos) giving the studio hope that maybe their flick wasn?t that bad after all. Well guess what? It?s every bit that bad?and then some. Renee Zellweger half-heartedly plays a crusading social worker who?s assigned to the case of a cute 10-year-girl named Lily (Jodelle Ferland) whose creepy parents try to lock her in the oven and incinerate her. They must be nuts right? Not so fast. After Zellweger?s conscience fuels her to adopt Lily she quickly discovers that maybe the parents weren?t so loco after all -- that the moody moppet is no Jonathan Lipnicki and probably as deadly as Damien. Speaking of which even if you?ve never sat through The Omen or The Bad Seed or Orphan or Joshua you?ve seen this hackneyed hell-spawn hooey before. Why does Lily do it? I sat through the thing and I still have no clue. But Bradley Cooper who turns up in a thankless role shot before The Hangover saved him from doing more of these kinds of movies sure doesn?t stick around long enough to find out. Trust me he got off easy.

The bastard offspring of ""The Bad Seed"" ""The Omen"" and ""Orphan"" homicidal-tyke thriller ""Case 39"" proves that this horror subgenres gene pool is definitely starting to thin out. Starring Renee Zellweger as an overzealous social worker who invites a demonic 10-year-old cutie pie into her own home this ludicrous outing from helmer Christian Alvart (""Pandorum"") and scribe Ray Wright (""The Crazies"") takes its psycho-satanic babble much too seriously and should elicit more laughs than frights during its long-delayed U.S. theatrical run. Already released in several foreign territories Paramounts problem child will find adequate foster care on cable and homevid. Shot in 2006 and withheld from domestic release for more than two years pic hit various overseas markets in 2009 and recently went straight to DVD in France Italy and Japan. (Pic grossed more than 3 million in Mexico and Spain and Paramount will likely target Hispanic auds Stateside where it will be released under the Paramount Vantage label.) While such delays arent entirely uncommon for certain studio-backed B-titles such an extended waiting period doesnt augur well and it takes only a few reels to see what the problem is. When child-services specialist Emily (Zellweger) investigates her latest subject the pale-faced aptly named Lilith (Jodelle Ferland) shes immediately drawn to the childs ghostly presence and sense of sheltered innocence. On a home visit to meet the girls parents (Callum Keith Rennie Kerry OMalley) Emily believes shes stumbled upon a clear-cut case of child abuse and her suspicions are confirmed a few nights later when she barges into the house and finds them trying to stuff poor little Lilith into the oven. With the help of a child psychologist (Bradley Cooper pre-""The Hangover"") and a local cop (Ian McShane post-""Deadwood"") Emily decides to take charge of Lilith herself. While such actions are already professionally dubious they soon prove to be more dangerous than she imagined Not only is Lilith getting bad grades in school but it turns out she likes to call people on the telephone and push them to commit gruesome acts of murder or suicide. She also has something to do with Satan though its never really clear what that is. While pic has at least one decent idea in transforming a tale of battered children into that of battered parents the originality buck stops there. Between Alvarts pedestrian handling of the five or six requisite death scenes and Michl Britschs ineffective score the suspense mostly rides on whether Lilith will actually seem evil enough when she says things like ""Ill tell you what scares me if you tell me what scares you."" Well nobodys getting scared anytime soon despite tyro horror star Ferlands (""Silent Hill"" ""Seed"") occasionally convincing turn in a role that often requires her to just stare for a long time at the other cast members. Faring slightly worse is Zellweger as a character who claims shes ""just not mom material"" but then inexplicably lobbies to take custody of Lilith only to try and give her back when she doesnt turn out to be the kind of kid she hoped for. Pic was filmed on location in Vancouver and its mood is somewhat enhanced by the eerie Gothic-style homes and interiors of production designer John Willet (""Final Destination""). In this ""Case"" the devil is in the details but nowhere else. Case 39ProductionA Paramount Vantage release of a Misher Films/Anonymous Content production. Produced by Steve Golin Kevin Misher.

One can see why. A miscast Renee Zellweger plays social worker Emily Jenkins who after saving ten-year-old Lilith (Jodelle Ferland) from being roasted alive in her mad parents oven offers her a home. At first Emily thinks that Lilith is a classic damaged child but then people start dying one of Liliths classmates bludgeons his parents to death; Emilys boyfriend is killed by a swarm of hornets. Sceptical sheriff Mike Barron (a somnambulant Ian McShane) insists that a damaged deceitful manipulative child is not a demon but by now Emilys do-gooder has pitched over into wild-eyed hysteria raving about how Lilith is a malevolent catalyst who causes her victims to hallucinate their deepest darkest fears. This is horror hokum of the cheesiest kind. Rent Orphan instead.

Admittedly there are holes in the plot that you could ride through on a horse and the casting is a little odd apart from the little girl who is perfect for the role.. the symbolism is a little laboured too but forget all of that and you can just switch off and watch some dumb old fashioned jumpy movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 11 2010CappybearFeaturedI must confess that I only went to see this film because Renee Zellweger was in it. My wife thinks that Adrian Lester is a bit of a hunk. Sadly theyre both at sea in this overlong unpersuasive hokum which begins to unravel - not that it made any sense in the first place - around the halfway mark. After four years lying on the shelf it makes you wonder why the film wasnt just released directly to DVD.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/87439/case-39.html,200,case396,case39,timeout

Director Christian Alvart all but embalms Renee Zellwegers habitual good cheer in a million cliches as the film explores in effect what kind of mental illness might lead someone to kill a child. Horrid enough for you? At first childless and as we later learn motherless social worker Zellweger is obsessed with saving a child (played by the unfortunate young Canadian actress Jodelle Ferland) from the monsters who have raised her and tried to cook her in an oven (and bury her in the basement and God knows what else).The film makes a dutiful nod at the over abundance of child abuse cases which occur in even the most affluent countries. But then having adopted the cute little creature Renee soon makes the shocking discovery that living with a child can be a love/hate experience And rather than come to terms with the difference between her fantasy of motherhood and the grubby frustrations of the real thing the film begins a queasy exploration of why Zellweger the idealistic and overworked career woman quickly turns into a bad mother who wants to kill her child too. Who can blame her? Within half an hour of moving in the monstrous little thing has killed all her friends and burned her house down. Whod be a mother This is a nasty and morally repulsive film.
