Rob Reiners half-baked melodrama ""The Bucket List"" is all about experiencing as much as you can before you die. Too bad the films DVD release doesnt prescribe to that idea. Two paltry extras do hardly a list make. The brief featurette ""Writing a Bucket List"" features freshman screenwriter Justin Zackham discussing the films main conceit with film clips interspersed throughout. What wouldve been much more interesting is to see the actual lists of Reiner and co-stars Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. If theres anything in this world that Nicholson hasnt already done that would be something to see. While Reiner has delivered smart entertaining commentary tracks in the past (""Princess Bride"" ""Stand By Me"") he decided to skip the exercise here. Also included on the DVD package is the video for John Mayers ""Say"" a goopy pop confection whose video recalls such cornball videos-as-trailers of yesteryear such as Bryan Adams ""Everything I Do I Do It for You.""

PHOTOGRAPHS TO BE USED SOLELY FOR ADVERTISING ... more Photo Sidney Baldwin Review Nicholson Freeman cant revive false Bucket List 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Bucket List Comedy-drama. Starring Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Rob Reiner. (PG-13. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Bucket List"" is about two likable old guys with terminal cancer and the movie is about as fun as that sounds. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play fellows who get up from their sickbeds and with their remaining time go out to do things they always wanted to do like skydiving and race car driving. One by one they tick the items off a list - things to experience before they kick the bucket. The movie has virtues but theyre intermittent while the problems are pervasive. That its medically false - these desperately sick guys are in amazing shape - is no big deal but the movie is emotionally false too. Its sentimental to the point of trivializing the awfulness of what these men are facing even as the plot shoehorns them into behavior that doesnt quite make sense. Ultimately the movie is caught in the crossfire of its two missions - to celebrate the universal things that ""really matter"" in life (friendship family) and to celebrate what it means to live like Jack Nicholson. Seriously. To a large extent ""The Bucket List"" is about Jack in winter. In the movie he plays a hospital tycoon but the lifestyle and the attitude are pure Nicholson. Hes a multimillionaire who lives life on his own terms. Hes impish has had lots of women and has been faithful to none of them. But no one is mad at him because he never pretends to be anything but who he is. Hes all about good times and following impulses admitting what you want and going after it. Not everybody gets to live like that but if a guy can why shouldnt he? Thats Eddie the character Nicholson plays in ""The Bucket List"" but its also the character he plays when he sits in the front row of the Academy Awards with some beautiful young thing. Thats what Nicholson has come to mean in American life. Its ghastly to think that eventually Nicholson will be dead and this movie will remain but when that dread day happens ""The Bucket List"" is going to go up a notch in quality. The reason is that for all this movies bone-deep dishonesty it introduces some ideas about what this important actor has come to represent in the public consciousness. Is Nicholsons rascally epicureanism a reasonable model for living and how does it translate into old age? To be a 30-year-old rogue is easy but to be one at 70 takes a certain moral physical and philosophical courage. Or is it just pathetic? Nicholson is paired with Freeman who as Carter represents the opposite principle. Carter got a girl pregnant a thousand or so years ago so he quit school got married and became a mechanic to support his family. He has lived an unadventurous life of sober commitment and now the sand is running out and he realizes he hasnt had much fun. The two men bond in their hospital room - their bonding is the most believable thing about the movie - and for reasons that arent easy to believe (but easy enough to accept) Carter decides to see the world with Eddie rather than spend his remaining months with his devoted wife. They see the pyramids and the Taj Mahal and the snow-peaked Himalayas and every so often the movie strikes just the right note Theyre having the greatest vacation in the world but it would be so much more fun if they werent dying. So the idea goes maybe they should have done this earlier - and so should everyone. Mainly though the movie is maudlin and false and yet Nicholson and Freeman are neither. Theyre grounded and connected playing off each other enjoying the others artistry and company. Nicholson is especially impressive. Its so easy to think of him as a self-parody. He practically invites that perception - but then see him even in junk like this going to deep places doing the unexpected. Nicholsons greatest acting feat may be the way he keeps making us forget that hes a great actor - and keeps making us discover it over and over. -- Advisory Adult themes adult talk sexual situations.

Photo Warner Bros The Bucket List 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Hollywood should release more films like The Bucket List. It should make more movies about death cancer and old folks jumping out of planes. And should cast Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson in every single one. Rob Reiners simple and impossibly earnest film is not a first-rank motion picture. It has no edge to it anywhere neither serrated nor blunt and its glucose content might give more sensitive viewers a migraine. Certain film snobs such as the beret-wearing mustache-twirling homunculus who lurks inside every critic are sure to blanche at the screenplays climactic narrative twist - which has been used in some (much better) movies and some (much trashier) TV series over the last oh 57 years and isnt exactly a good fit here. But The Bucket List has a few things going for it the first two being those marvelous coots in the leads. Freeman and Nicholson play characters named Carter Chambers and Edward Cole respectively but theyre really just acting out versions of their own widely established public personae righteous and plummy for one charming and sleazy for the other. I dont have to tell you which is which. And I hardly have to explain that the righteous one winds up doling out wisdom for the sleaze while the sleaze doles out barbed observations from cushy settings around the world. If youve seen the trailer and who hasnt you know that Carter and Edward are both dying of cancer. Edward owns the company that privatized and downsized the hospital where both men now receive treatment; in one of his own cost-cutting measures he is forced to share a room with Carter. Thus they meet joke puke spar. They receive near-simultaneous diagnoses predicting six months to live a year at the outside. And so they resolve with a bit of needling on Edwards part to embark on a globe-trotting quest to knock a few last items off their terminal to-do list. Edward wants to sky-dive. Carter wants to ``help a complete stranger for the good. Edward wants a tattoo. Carter wants to drive a Mustang Shelby. They both want to see a bit more of the world before they croak so off they kazoom in Edwards private jet - to dine in the south of France sing ``a-wimoweh on safari gaze at the Pyramids in Egypt and mull over funeral plans at the Taj Mahal. ``Buried or cremated? Edward asks. Or maybe ``go frozen like Walt Disney? Justin Zackhams episodic screenplay bustles forward like a travelogue through the five stages of grief. Edward and Carter are too way too tidy in their diametric character traits Edward the wealthy magnate Carter the auto mechanic. Edward the swinging atheist Carter the long-married man of faith. Edward the estranged father; Carter the proud papa. All is not as it seems (Edward aint so bad Carter aint so happy) but even this revelation has the annoying ship-shape symmetry of well-made bunkum. Life is much messier than this. Death is much messier than this. But heres the thing At least Reiners trying. At least he isnt trading on the hardened cynicism of his last outing 2005s stiff aimless Rumor Has It. In The Bucket List he gets religion or something close to it as he explores the healing power of illness. The movies chief and enduring pleasure is the chance to watch two huge lions of cinema tear into subjects - metastasized tumors anyone? - that most mainstream films ignore and they tear into them with humor and pathos. More power to them. Not every film about death needs a bald Swede and a game of chess Sometimes the sky-divings enough. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Apple Sale at eBay Up to 60% off + free shipping Polo Ralph Lauren Mens Shoes for 20 + 5 samp;h Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post All his life Carter Chambers has done the right thing. When wife Virginia became pregnant 45 years ago he shelved his hopes of becoming a history professor and went to work on cars. That sacrifice served his family well. When we meet him hes in a garage fielding arcane challenges from a co-worker. Hes one of those ""Jeopardy"" addicts the auto mechanic as autodidact. With four ex-wives one estranged daughter and nary a friend in sight Edward Cole has done right mainly by his accountants. A health-care tycoon he buys ailing hospitals and performs radical surgery on them. RATING | Buddy Comedy ""I run hospitals not health spas"" he informs a group of administrators. Then he coughs up blood and heads to one of his ""two beds no exceptions"" facilities personal assistant Thomas in tow. When Edward (Jack Nicholson) meets Carter (Morgan Freeman) in director Rob Reiners tear-coaxing comedy ""The Bucket List"" theyve each had lousy news cancer. Yet that one word and the treatment experiences they share turn out to be enough territory to build on. ""The Bucket List"" refers to a project a college professor assigned Carter his freshman year. Write down things you want to do before dying. In a hospital bed Carter begins revising that ""young mans list."" The doable and decent -- ""Witness something majestic"" and ""Laugh till you cry"" -- have replaced more material goals. When Edward sees it he pumps it up. Theirs is a list composed by a man of means and a man always searching for meaning. It has been a movie season of potent pairings Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. Watching Nicholson and Freeman on the same screen and their characters Edward and Carter embarking on a sojourn of discovery is hard to resist. Reiner and screenwriter Justin Zackham were unable to resist beginning this tale of living life like its waxing not waning with Freeman the master of the voice- over setting the grander tone for the story. As a man ascends a Himalayan peak the narrator tells us Edward Cole died with ""his eyes closed and his heart open."" If you dont flinch at that phrase and the news that one of the characters is doomed then youre ready for this sentimental journey. Two veteran actors are in the trenches of motion-picture illness and their time in the hospital isnt prettified. A scar traverses Edwards shaved scalp. Chills rattle Carter as he sleeps. Each takes midnight runs to the john an IV stand for company. A smart-aleck retort about the ""smell of chemo in the morning"" is followed by a gut-wrenching night of pain. ""Its not funny"" said my 82-year-old father after a stifled laugh. ""It could happen to me. Cancer could happen to anyone."" This chuckle-epiphany response is the movies achievements. Like the goofball moments that take place between friends there are wince-inducing scenes. (For instance its hard to figure out if its the song or the singers that make Carter and Edwards rendition of ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" so awful.) But as the two trek from the Serengeti to the pyramids to the Taj Mahal their conversations and friendship deepen. Nicholson starts off with big gestures. There are a couple of scenes early on when Nicholson appears to be channeling Lewis Black the comedian with the overly emphatic delivery. But theres a method to his mania and over time Edward becomes tempered. Freeman undertakes a different task. He knows his Carter better than we and reveals the depths of this teacherly soul slowly. This buddy movie leaves scant room for other actors. As Edwards oncologist Rob Morrow is wasted or just right depending on how you feel about doctors. Sean Hayes plays Thomas Edwards guy Friday and every other day of the week. The actor best known as Jack on ""Will amp; Grace"" is as still and observant as his TV character was manic and self- involved. Beverly Todd as Virginia Chambers rises to a helpmate challenge pulling off reasonable anger -- at mortality at Carter -- while remaining sympathetic.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor January 11 2008 Save for later Saved The Bucket List Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) get a late jump-start in life by trying daredevil pursuits such as skydiving. Courtesy of Sidney Baldwin/Warner Brothers          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The spectacle of watching Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman horsing around together may be enough to entice audiences to check out ""The Bucket List"" but will this be enough to keep them in their seats? A movie star by definition is someone you are willing to watch in just about anything. If thats the case ""The Bucket List"" a slapstick weepie cloddishy directed by Rob Reiner is a bona fide star vehicle. But this vehicle really should be junked.Carter Chambers (Freeman) is an easygoing auto mechanic who finds himself sharing a room in the same cancer ward with Edward Cole (Nicholson) a cranky billionaire entrepreneur who also happens to own the hospital. Why would Edward share a room in his own hospital? The ostensible reason is that he has mandated equal treatment for all patients including himself. The real reason of course is that if these two polar opposites did not start out in the same room together there would be no movie.One swallow doesnt make a summer and one contrivance doesnt necessarily make for a bad movie. But as the manipulations pile up ""The Bucket List"" begins to defy human reason. Carter you see has jotted down a few modest things hed like to do before he kicks the bucket and Edward who has conveniently also gone into remission and who even more conveniently has a private jet ups the stakes. They go skydiving race-car driving encamp in luxury surroundings visit the south of France the Taj Mahal the Great Wall of China the Pyramids the Himalayas and Hong Kong. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? You might think that all these eye-popping locales would at least make for some good scenery but the cinematography is cheesy and its obvious that the dynamic duo have been digitally retrofitted into the landscape. In other words Freeman and Nicholson didnt even get a dream vacation out of ""The Bucket List."" Theyve probably been to all those places anyway. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? This Bucket feels listless As the bald-pated imperiously prickly Edward Nicholson doesnt seem to mind that hes playing ""Jack."" This isnt an acting job for him its a field day. Reiner and his first-time screenwriter Justin Zackham leaven Edwards goofiness with a ""serious"" back story - hes been through four wives and is estranged from his daughter - but thats just garnish.Freeman on the other hand has a more difficult time trying to live up to - or more exactly live down - all this nonsense. His gravitas keeps getting in the way. Freemans fitful stabs at real acting as in Carters wholly unconvincing argument with his wife (Beverly Todd) who sets up his world tour only emphasize the silliness of the material.Much has been made in the press over the years about the scarcity of Hollywood movies for older audiences. ""The Bucket List"" like ""Grumpy Old Men"" before it is an attempt to tap a senior-citizen demographic while also feigning ""universality."" But just because a movie features two movie stars well into their AARP sunset is no reason to champion it. Even if the film becomes a commercial smash you can bet it will only lead to more of the same pap.Its no secret except to Hollywood executives that audiences over say 60 are famished for movies - good movies - about their generation. The notion that films only appeal to an under-30 demographic is a self-fulfilling prophecy generated by the studios which are mostly run by boomers trying to recapture the Fountain of Youth. ""The Bucket List"" is a movie for oldsters that paradoxically looks as if it was made for 15-year-olds. If this is what is meant in Hollywood as ""thinking outside the box"" then its time to get a new box. Grade D+ Rated PG-13 for language including a sexual reference.

Now if only director Rob Reiner hadnt rubbed our noses in a bouquet of plastic blooms. On the list of the 1000 movies you should see before you die you will not find The Bucket List which itemizes places to see and emotions to experience before terminal illness claims you. In its rush to tick off every entry Bucket catalogs places - the Pyramids Great Wall of China Taj Mahal - that have all the poetry of a souvenir postcard. It depicts emotions - denial grief acceptance - with performances that are faxed in from Hamville. Its as if director Reiner thought that merely by pointing his camera at scenic places and scenic faces his work would be done. Which is like assembling expensive ingredients and expecting them to cook themselves into a tasty meal. There are few sorrier sights than beloved actors coasting on audience goodwill which is what Reiner permits Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman to do here. Nicholson is Edward Cole health-care jillionaire and borderline diabolical in his self-satisfaction. Morgan Freeman is Carter Chambers mechanic and family man near saintly in his selflessness. Ordinarily men such as Edward and Carter would not cross paths. But cancer is a great leveller. And Edward has amassed his jillions by decreeing ""two patients to a room - no exceptions."" So there they are the arrogant blusterer and the humble philosopher with similar prognoses Doomed to die within the year. Carter has a loving spouse and children to support him. Except for his personal assistant nicely played by a deadpan Sean Hayes Edward is alone. When he spies Carter scribbling a list of things he wanted to do before he kicks the bucket - e.g. ""go skydiving"" - Edward has an idea. Furnishing his private jet and bottomless checkbook to help Carter achieve his goals Edward effectively buys his companionship estranging the mechanic from his wife of 46 years. That a family man such as Carter would accept such a proposal is so ludicrously out of character that it insults the audience. Still there are pleasures to be had in watching the actors collect their paychecks. I would submit that Freemans gravelly baritone and Nicholsons dancing eyebrows are wonders no less remarkable than the Pyramids and Taj Mahal. Next time please lets have them in a movie that does not reduce notable performers and majestic places to brand names on a must-have list. The Bucket List  (out of four stars) Directed by Rob Reiner.

Star Tribune The Bucket List Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Great actors sometimes transcend their material but Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman cant pull their boots free from the ankle-deep schmaltz of ""The Bucket List."" In this stillborn comedy they play terminally ill men chasing their dreams on a round-the-world trip. Its terribly earnest terribly well-intentioned -- and terrible. Rob Reiner directs as if hes trying to win a medal for sincerity. He puts a big bowl of Chicken Soup for the Soul in front of you and pushes your face in it. How insipid this film looks next to ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" a brave artful movie about facing infirmity with dignity and humor or ""The Savages"" a beautifully acted emotionally honest comedy that looks aging and death straight in the eye. I wouldnt trade a single frame of either for this 97-minute wallow in crocodile tears. In what must be a first the film gives us a ""meet cute"" in a cancer ward. Hospital tycoon Edward Cole (Nicholson) a friendless Scrooge is obliged by his own cost-cutting policies to bunk alongside Carter Chambers (Freeman) a philosophical auto mechanic. Cole humbled by his poor health forms an unlikely misery-loves-company friendship with his roommate. Chambers assembles a catalog of experiences hed hoped to have before family duties confined him in the garage ""See something truly majestic"" and so forth. The billionaire adds a few unfulfilled wishes of his own (""Kiss the most beautiful girl on earth"") and takes his new buddy on a globe-trotting vacation to check off every item on their shared agenda. Were off on a sightseeing excursion where the stars are unconvincingly green-screened into the Pyramids the Great Wall of China and the Serengeti while learning Important Life Lessons. Freeman does his standard world-weary nobility thing while Nicholson offers a tamped-down version of Crazy Jack. Then again with material like this what are their options? Justin Zackhams screenplay alternates look-at-me Im-being-flippant wisecracks with schematic sentimental schlock. Theres scant tension in this odd couples unlikely friendship and their meant-to-be-lovable character foibles are like something constructed by following diagrams. Not one scene is open to a viewers interpretation; each moment is calculated to goose-step us toward hackneyed uplift. Guess what? The most important experiences are the ones you can have right at home. When the actors give it their all the hollow material becomes all the harder to swallow. A voiceover informs us with Hallmark card eloquence that one character ""died with his eyes closed and his heart open."" Zackham worked with his heart on his sleeve then opened his mouth and put his foot in it. Ive seen promotional standees in theater lobbies that have moved me more.

Just think of the pitch Weve got Jack Nicholson Morgan Freeman Well get Rob Reiner to direct Maybe get Wham to play at the post-premiere party. Today unfortunately The Bucket List plays to all the bad habits Nicholson Freeman and Reiner have developed in the intervening years. (We wont even discuss Wham) The film is sappy manipulative and with the exception of a couple of minutes near the end when Nicholson gets angry doesnt have a moment of genuine emotion in it. Looks nice though. As a soft-focus travelog its quite a success. Nicholson stars as Edward Cole a billionaire who streamlines hospitals (read lays people off). Freeman plays Carter Chambers who has worked for more than 40 years as an auto mechanic. Cole is rich but unhappy. Chambers is brilliant but unfulfilled. Think of any and every cliche you can to illustrate those types of characters and youll have a good start. Hmm. If only a plot device existed to bring these two together and give each man what he lacked. Wait Cancer Yes both men are diagnosed with terminal cancer; each is told he has a year or less to live. Chambers remembers a college class in which he was assigned a list of things to do before he kicked the . . . you know. So with Coles money and Chambers idea the two set off on a worldwide adventure that includes skydiving driving a Shelby Mustang going on a safari seeing (almost) the Himalayas etc. (Their cancer only rarely slows them down with pesky symptoms.) Cole has no friends and is estranged from his daughter - see if you can guess where that particular plot thread is heading - and Chambers relationship with his wife (Beverly Todd) has cooled. So the two men are free to roam the planet and discuss the Big Ticket Items whether there is a God whether theyve found joy in their lives whether theyve led others to find joy etc. etc. Its not that these are unimportant topics unworthy of examination in a movie. Its that theyre handled with such heavy hands here - Reiners - that you dont really care what the answers are. Nicholsons performance borders on parody. Every over-the-top antic hes capable of is on display here. Every line is oversold every mannerism exaggerated. Only during a couple of scenes - one in which hes angry one when hes simply waiting with Chambers wife - does Nicholson rein anything in. Freeman meanwhile is often cast as the wise man (and as the narrator a role he has here as well). But Chambers isnt just smart not just wise. Hes Albert Einstein wielding a crescent wrench. In the hospital and in other places Cole and Chambers often watch Jeopardy. Chambers doesnt just get most of the questions right. He gets them all right all the time. He never loses to Cole in gin rummy. With the exception of one slight mistake in translation he knows everything. He should have spent his last few months curing cancer not dying from it. Sean Hayes is on hand as Coles put-upon assistant providing what passes for comic relief (he basically serves as Coles punching bag). Its a thankless job listening to Cole go on and on about everything. Believe me when you see the film youll see. If you decide to see The Bucket List that is. And who knows maybe you will. It has big stars pretty scenery all that. Just one thing Dont wake me up before you go-go. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Sidney Baldwin) D The Bucket List Genre Comedy; Starring Morgan Freeman Jack Nicholson Sean Hayes; Director Rob Reiner; Author Justin Zackham; Release Date Limited 12/25/2007; Release Date Wide 01/18/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 98; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted January 16 2008 -- 1200 AM EST Sitting atop of one of the Egyptian pyramids Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman as terminally ill cancer patients engage in a sentimental philosophical chat about life and loss. The two have decided to travel around the globe doing whatever the heck they want; they can afford it since the Nicholson character is a billionaire CEO. The first thing to say about The Bucket List is that Rob Reiner is the rare director who can take all the wonder out of one of the seven wonders of the world. The way that the pyramid theyre sitting on is lit and shot it looks completely fake and the one in the distance could be a rear-projection backdrop. The second thing to observe is that the conversation might be taking place almost anywhere -- in a coffee shop say or back in the dingy hospital room where Nicholson as an aging playboy with four ex-wives and Freeman as a mechanic who has spent his life sacrificing for his family first met discovered that they had absolutely nothing in common and decided to bond over their tragic illnesses and become friends anyway. The biggest surprise of The Bucket List is how casually it treats the whole ""bucket list"" of wild-things-to-do-before-we-die concept. Its fun for two minutes to see Nicholson and Freeman jumping out of a plane but once theyve gotten tattoos and raced vintage cars (to the cloying been-there-heard-that accompaniment of ZZ Tops ""Tush"") the movie is already scraping the bottom of the bucket. Basically they spend the rest of the time doing disease-of-the-week buddy-movie therapy against the backdrop of world landmarks. Nicholson has the benefit of playing a rascal so self-centered he veers into unpleasantness but Freeman as the brilliant working-class autodidact whose one ""flaw"" is that his marriage suffered from empty-nest syndrome reminds us once again that its long past time this actor played someone who isnt a saint. If he and Jack had traded roles there might have been one thing about the drably tender Bucket List that surprised you.

By David Denby Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman in Rob Reiners ""The Bucket List.""   Credit BARRY BLITT The holidays are over and its time to sweep up the sticky pine needles cracked ornaments and occasional twirled bits of pretty ribbon that have gathered under the tree. ""The Bucket List"" a comedy about two terminal-cancer patients living it up severely tests ones critical compassion. I know Im not a good enough person to pass the test but Im not sure anyone else is either. (Todd McCarthy in Variety called the movie "" Ikiru for meatheads."") ""The Bucket List"" which was written by Justin Zackham and directed by Rob Reiner seems to have been created by applying algorithms to sentiment. Jack Nicholson plays a crass and rancorous billionaire and Morgan Freeman an intellectual who was forced by family obligations to become an auto mechanic. Nicholson is bulge-eyed heavy-bellied and super-emphatic; Freeman is wise baritonal and eloquent. I omit the character names because the two stars are doing what theyve done a great deal of recently and theyre drawing on the audiences feelings for them. The picture might have been better if the filmmakers had played around with the actors a bit--reversed the roles for instance so that Nicholson rather than Freeman unfurled the fortune-cookie wisdom about bringing joy to other people before you die and Freeman rather than Nicholson snarled that money is the only thing that matters in a rotten world. But no such luck Reiners Hollywood heart is too pure for mischief. After some fairly grim scenes at a Los Angeles hospital where the men meet ""The Bucket List"" turns into a globe-trotting tour disguised as a search for enlightenment. Determined to find what is missing in their lives the two geezers write down a series of wild-and-crazy things to do using Nicholsons money. Cheeks flattened by the wind they jump out of airplanes. On an empty racetrack they play bumper cars with a pair of Shelby GT350s. They visit the glamour spots--the Himalayas Hong Kong the pyramids the South of France the Taj Mahal and the African savanna where the terrain bursts with enough digital zebras to freeze a supercomputer. In general the light is golden the mood technologically sublime the actuality of the experience a dead zero. Reiner does a few things with a sure hand. The two men warm to each other slowly and Reiner manages the stages of friendship--mutual indifference changing into ironical tolerance then into irritated appreciation and finally into dependence--with psychologically acute detail. Nicholsons character is estranged from his daughter Freemans from his wife and each takes a turn persuading the other to set things right an interference that gives the actors a chance to display a little temper. These blowups which make an instructive contrast in acting styles are the most entertaining thing in the movie. Both men are seventy but Freeman seems to be handling age with greater ease. He is tall and straight and when his eyes blaze and his voice hardens hes still the most commanding actor in Hollywood. As Nicholson does his neck-jutting rage his acquired bulk swerves and spills with alarming violence. ""The Bucket List"" will quickly be kicked into oblivion but at a lifetime-achievement-award ceremony Nicholsons tempest will fit nicely into a montage of Crazy Jack moments. If youre curious about pride in old age and want to see something more literate than ""The Bucket List"" you might drop in on the recent independent movie ""Starting Out in the Evening"" in which Frank Langella plays with formidable dignity a once famous writer named Leonard Schiller. A man in his seventies who knows what he knows and has little interest in learning much more Schiller lives in a funereal apartment on the Upper West Side. Amid dark-stained bookcases he pecks away at a novel on a typewriter and tries to fend off an ambitious and needy female graduate student (Lauren Ambrose) who wants to revive both his career and his sex life. The director Andrew Wagner depicts Schillers relations with the student and also with his wayward daughter (Lili Taylor) with some delicacy--perhaps too much delicacy. Schiller is meant to be a survivor of the New York Jewish literary renaissance of the nineteen-fifties and sixties but the movie for all its considerable intelligence dries out his temperament too much. Anyone who remembers that vanished tribe of New Yorkers knows that even in their later years they made a joke now and then and were given to malice and desire as well as to bouts of intellectual severity. After a while Schillers austere ironies wilt ones respect for him. Langella is superb and ""Starting Out in the Evening"" is a classy film--I never thought I would hear the phrase ""Trilling Howe and especially Edmund Wilson"" uttered in a movie theatre--but it could have used a little less circumspection a little more juice. John Sayless ""Honeydripper"" is a good movie for a dark icy day. Its set in rural Alabama in 1950 at harvest time and the cotton fields and the red-leafed trees as photographed by Dick Pope appear lustrous and warming. Like some of Sayless earlier films--""Passion Fish"" and ""Sunshine State"" in particular--""Honeydripper"" is at its best when the characters sit around dither and ruminate. Moviemaking seems to have become almost magically easy for this independent writer-director. He builds a detailed atmosphere brings his good people and his bad together and lets them jabber at one another; the virtuosity is rhetorical rather than visual. Often not much happens--at least not in conventional terms. In ""Honeydripper"" Stacy Keach plays a racist sheriff who more or less runs the small town of Harmony. The sheriff is powerless though in the most important way. He lacks music. The center of the movie is an old bare wood-plank jazz club the Honeydripper Lounge situated near the cotton fields and presided over by Pine Top Purvis (Danny Glover) a retired boogie-woogie piano player who is running out of cash. His club is almost dead (the crowds have gone to hear the jukebox at an adjoining establishment) so Pine Top engages Guitar Sam a famous jazz musician from New Orleans. (Sayles has said that any similarities to the real-life Pinetop Perkins and Guitar Slim are merely incidental.) When the genius doesnt show Pine Top substitutes a young wanderer (Gary Clark Jr.) who miraculously brings the place alive with his electric guitar. ""Honeydripper"" is a fable of musical rebirth complete with a blind angel (Keb Mo) who sits on the street playing the blues and making witty remarks. Its the gentlest movie imaginable but in its own way it covers a lot of ground. In a long monologue that Danny Glover delivers in an impassioned whisper Pine Top imagines the first slave to sit down at a piano in the masters house--a shackled man who realizes that he could attain power by making music. Pine Tops reminiscences include his youth in the jazz clubs of New Orleans. In the course of the movie an elderly blues singer (Mable John) working at the Honeydripper performs her last set and theres also a local church choir which backs up a pastors chanted invocations of Jesus saving power. By the time the young guitarist begins playing and singing we realize that we have progressed through the entire history of black music and arrived at something new. Sayless modest manner conceals a major claim in ""Honeydripper"" in that tiny club he has created his version of the birth of rock and roll. None less than the Beatles turn up in Jake Kasdans ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story."" The movie written by Kasdan and Judd Apatow is an uneven spoof of music bio-pics (especially ""Walk the Line"") with John C. Reilly playing a hapless dolt who rises to the top by imitating every popular style at exactly the right moment from Elvis to the Fab Four to Dylan. Dewey encounters the Beatles in India dropping acid and sitting in the lotus position with the Maharishi. Jack Black (Paul McCartney) Paul Rudd (John Lennon) Justin Long (George Harrison) and Jason Schwartzman (Ringo Starr) do Liverpudlian with hilarious brio--its just a single scene but its the funniest thing in the movie. Apart from Christopher Guests mock documentaries (""This Is Spinal Tap"" ""A Mighty Wind"") parody of a tired genre probably works best as a sketch. ""Walk Hard"" runs down quickly and suffers further from having the wide-eyed and weightless Reilly as its star. Although hes a fine character actor Reilly is not charismatic or funny enough to hold the picture together so one waits for the few good bits. Bob Dylan fans will be amused by the cryptic strangled poetry of the lyrics for the Dylan-style song that Dewey sings but such jokes as having three black-bearded men named LChaim Mazel Tov and Schmendrick turn up as Deweys managers may have cracked up a script conference but do no more than lightly amuse the audience. And the same is true for an orgy scene including a penis an organ that Apatow in recent interviews has vowed to bring into mainstream film-making. Well there it is and the truth is that after the surprise of its first appearance the member doesnt bring all that much to the party.

"Review Bucket List should have stayed in drawer - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Bucket List should have stayed in drawerStory Highlights ""The Bucket List"" stars Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman The two star as terminally ill patients with a list of things they want to do Review Nicholson ""has some fun""; Freeman is on ""cruise control"" Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- ""The Bucket List"" director Rob Reiners latest suggests dying could be the best thing that ever happens to you -- just so long as you find a lonely billionaire lying in the next bed. In ""The Bucket List"" Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman have a number of things they want to do before they die. Morgan Freeman is Carter Chambers a mechanic who dropped out of college to get married and provide for his kids. Carter knows a lot about pretty much everything -- hes a whiz at ""Jeopardy"" -- but when the doctors give him less than a year to live hes not so sure about anything any more. Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is dealt the same lousy hand -- a turn of events that requires some mental adjustment. Hes not used to losing. Not only is he fabulously wealthy this is his hospital. But all his power and money cant make any difference now. Or can it? Save for some early odd-couple prickliness the two men hit it off and soon Edward suggests they team up and work through Carters whimsically scrawled ""bucket list"" -- i.e. things to do before kicking it. Watch Freeman talk about his own list >> Carter doesnt take much persuasion. Hes given decades to the wife and kids and he figures hes overdue some down time. If that strikes you as selfish and heartless -- or at least typical for a guy -- wait until you get a load of the list. Carter has a yen to drive a Mustang Shelby. Edward wants a tattoo. Theyre both up for some skydiving. Every so often theres a token reminder that these seniors (both actors turned 70 this year) are terminally ill. But more often the movie plays their imminent expiration date for kamikaze laughs. Boys will be boys heh heh. Spiritual contemplation isnt entirely off limits but its relegated to the status of sightseeing. They visit the pyramids and the Taj Mahal or at least what appears to be a blue-screen simulacra of the same. They go on safari and ponder the possibilities of reincarnation in the Himalayas. Its exactly this kind of pre-packaged epiphany Wes Anderson satirized in the maligned ""Darjeeling Limited."" Freeman doesnt exactly exert himself as Carter assumes the role of sagacious tour guide (and our narrator). Hes an actor who flips too easily into cruise control and he switches it on regularly in ""The Bucket List."" Nicholson at least has some fun with his role -- listen to the way he pronounces ""America"" at the end of their journey; injecting both contempt and satisfaction in those four syllables. He works up some rapport with Sean Hayes very droll as Edwards sardonic personal assistant but theres not much give and take going on with Freeman. Their friendship scarcely feels tested. Ever the cynic Nicholson settles for skepticism sniffing the air for a hint of tension that isnt really there. Predictably the best Jack Zackhams script can supply is Carters wife (Beverly Todd) and Edwards daughter. Women Cant live with em cant die without em. All good things come to an end and its the same with the not so good -- they just feel longer. Watching ""The Bucket List"" may not inspire philosophical introspection but its quite likely to make you re-examine your priorities. At least as far as movie-going is concerned. ""The Bucket List"" is rated PG-13 and runs 97 minutes.

"Nicholson kicks Bucket with annoying acting - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Nicholson kicks Bucket with annoying acting Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY TheBucket List ( 1/2) is beyond the pale. The story of two terminal cancer patients undertaking the adventures they had hoped to experience before kicking the bucket is meant to be heartwarming and touching. Instead its superficial manipulative and schmaltzy. Edward (Jack Nicholson) and Carter (Morgan Freeman) are the two dying but symptom-free men. They meet in a hospital owned by Edward a self-made billionaire. They share a room because Edwards assistant (Sean Hayes) insists that for public relations reasons his boss must follow his ""two beds to a room no exceptions"" mantra and share his spartan quarters. Edward is not a charming fellow. He berates his assistant is estranged from his only daughter appears to have no friendships and is a rabid womanizer. Yet were supposed to find him endearing. Mostly however as played heavy-handedly by Nicholson hes just annoying. Mugging mercilessly Nicholson tries to browbeat us into caring about his character. On the other hand Freemans mechanic is a much easier sell. Carter is a kind family man with an easy laugh who sacrificed his education to provide for his family. Where Edward is self-aggrandizing and cocky Carter is warm and engaging. Still they form a friendship built primarily on their shared sense of mortality. Edward persuades Carter to accompany him on a series of exotic adventures that include skydiving racing cars and visiting global landmarks such as the Egyptian pyramids and the Taj Mahal and taking a safari in Tanzania. Theres lots of yelling and chortling during the daredevil antics and some vapid soul-searching as they gaze upon man-made wonders. The message is trite and familiar Live life to the fullest. Find personal joy and bring happiness to others. Freeman given the rare bits of poignant dialogue has some nice moments. Nicholson is the very definition of obnoxious. Hes particularly off-putting as hes about to leap out of an airplane and defiantly irritating when hes free-falling. ""I got a feeling Im faaaallllling. Im falling in love"" he yells maniacally. He had just finished taunting the nervous Carter scoffing at his hesitation ""Youre just afraid youll show up at your funeral as a Denver omelet."" The combination of trite dialogue and wild-eyed scenery-chewing is particularly unpleasant. When things get dull Carters wife (Beverly Todd) materializes to add some contrived conflict. Perhaps if director Rob Reiner had reined in Nicholson or if the screenplay by Justin Zackham had been more subtle this might have been an intriguing meditation on the meaning of life in the face of impending death. But their chemistry seems forced and the entire undertaking feels like a waste of time and talent. (Rated PG-13 for language including a sexual reference. Running time 1 hour 37 minutes.

The Bucket List Meets an early death | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsThe Bucket List Meets an early deathThe embalming process begins early in The Bucket List a comedy about the pre-coffin hijinks of two cantankerous coots. By Peter HowellMovie CriticMon. Dec. 24 2007 (out of 4) Starring Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Rob Reiner. 95 minutes. At the Queensway Varsity. PG The embalming process begins early in The Bucket List a comedy about the pre-coffin hijinks of two cantankerous coots. All involved in this tepid excuse for feel-good entertainment seem to have checked out long before the faint pulse died. This includes stars Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman director Rob Reiner and the entire tech crew from the cinematographer lensing the obviously fake-backdrop location shots to the continuity person who magically restores hair and vitality to terminally ill men. Oh and dont forget the soundtrack drone who figured Wimoweh is a clever tune for an African safari. Most vacant of all though is the script by first-timer Justin Zackham. Its a distressing hint at what Hollywood might be like a few months from now if the current writers strike continues and producers are forced to hire Hallmark Cards scribes to churn out screenplays. Meaningful and even amusing movies can certainly be made about people coming to grips with a life-changing illness. (See The Diving Bell and the Butterfly for that.) The Bucket List just isnt one of them. Its titled for the crumpled piece of yellow paper that philosophical auto mechanic Carter (Freeman) scribbles on while enduring a hospital stay with fellow impending bucket kicker Edward (Nicholson) a perpetually peeved zillionaire. When Edward finds Carters list and reads its to-do mandate for geriatric adventure he instantly busts the duo out of bedpan alley therefore to fulfill the skydiving auto racing and pyramid climbing of his new pals dreams. The duo occasionally takes a breather to yell at each other and to question whether they should return home. Henpecked Carter has a wife (an unsympathetic Beverly Todd) to consider while four-times-divorced Edward has a messy family situation of his own to deal with. Dropping in from time to time to facilitate things is Sean Hayes from TVs Will amp; Grace. He plays Carters personal fix-it man whose real name is Matthew but whom Carter calls Thomas just for the hell of it. Rumour has it that Hayes was once funny. All of the above makes The Bucket List sound worse than it really is. This will play just fine with people of a certain age looking for a safe 90-minute movie where the drama is telegraphed and the uplift is guaranteed. And who also wont groan at the years worst product placement involving two cans of Chock full o Nuts coffee. What has happened to Rob Reiner the guy who made When Harry Met Sally and This Is Spinal Tap? All hes managed to do with this is prove there is no upper age limit for toilet jokes.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. P) BY Jack Mathews Tuesday June 3 2008 327 PM The Bucket List. Two cancer patients create a list of things to do before they die and then do them. With Jack Nicholson Morgan Freeman. Director Rob Reiner. (138) PG-13 Language. At area theaters.One has played the Devil and the other God and thats pretty much what Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman do in Rob Reiners offbeat road movie ""The Bucket List.""Tailored like an Italian suit to the actors personas ""The Bucket List"" tells the funny sad and overly sentimental story of two late-middle-age men who meet as patients in a cancer ward and decide to draw up a list of things theyd like to do before they die then set out to do them.Skydive. Check. Race fast cars. Check. Visit the Taj Mahal the Great Wall of China the Himalayas. Check check check.To say this is high concept is to sell Reiner and screenwriter Justin Zackham short. This thing is drawn up like a highlights reel from the actors careers. Give Nicholson a couple of tantrums to throw give Freeman some lines that will flow from his lips like honeyed wisdom and enjoy the familiar show. Their trip is made possible by the wealth of Nicholsons Edward Cole and made tolerable by the calming presence of Freemans Carter Chambers an auto mechanic and armchair ""Jeopardy"" whiz. Both members of this odd couple have issues besides their health. Edward has an estranged daughter that prompts Carter to add ""reconciliation"" to the bucket list. And Carters reflections on his 47-year marriage cause Edward to hatch an eye-opening scheme.Despite some emotional dips and a see-it-to-believe-it load of schmaltz at the end ""The Bucket List"" is mostly a joy ride with good company and the actors obviously were having a high time on their traveling boondoggle.Nicholson and Freeman both 70 had not worked together before but they are as in step as Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly hoofing together as old-timers in ""Thats Entertainment"" Sometimes you just have to trust the chemistry.Nicholson being Nicholson he has more volume to his performance and Freeman being Freeman he has more weight to his.

In other words its a feel-good movie. Jack Nicholson plays a health-care firm CEO who finds himself a patient in one of his own hospitals. Thanks to his cost-cutting ""two beds to a room no exceptions"" policy (and a forgivable script contrivance) he gets parked in the same room as a mechanic (Morgan Freeman) who wanted to be a history professor before life made other plans for him. The pair dont hit it off. ""Ive taken baths deeper than you"" humble Carter (Freeman) tells money-mad Edward (Nicholson). Both men have only months to live but while their cancers are in remission Edward gets a peek at the wish list of what Carter always wanted to do before he kicks the bucket - things like ""witness something majestic."" ""Not to be judgmental but this is extremely weak"" says Edward delivering one of many classic Jack lines in Justin Zackhams well-oiled script. Edward who doesnt believe in God has a few barbaric yawps hed like to let loose before he takes a dirt nap and since hes got billions he suggests expanding the bucket list James Bond-style. Soon theyre leaping out of airplanes racing Mustang Shelbys (the holiday seasons product-placement superstar - it also features in the other big Warner Bros. holiday movie ""I Am Legend""); seeing the Pyramids and going on safari. Carter being happily married declines the offer of an orgy though Edward protests ""Orgys not even unfaithful. Its just . . . professional."" The script is so formulaic that the sound of the pages of the screenwriters manual being turned almost drowns out the mellow music of Freemans narration and theres a glossy pat TV-ness about everything. Sean Hayes of ""Will amp; Grace"" is on hand as Edwards assistant/punching bag and Rob Morrow has been busted back to playing a doctor. The casting is not what you would call adventurous; after all these years Freeman is still essentially driving Miss Daisy. Yet this popcorn picture about death looks like director Rob Reiners first big hit since ""A Few Good Men"" full of well-earned rueful humor (""Somewhere some lucky guy is having a heart attack"" Edward says while getting the business from chemo). The banter is sharp yet it sounds like real people talking too. Those who like their meaning-of-life flicks to be infested with vague/heavy symbolism and to be presented in black and white or at least in Swedish wont like to hear this but commercial as it is ""The Bucket List"" is slightly daring and more than a little bit wise. Hollywood dislikes old people and loathes philosophy but older viewers especially will find that this script touches important questions with wit and grace. Does Carter owe it to his family to die in a hospital bed so they can hover around him in a pity party or does he owe even more to himself? When Edward receives his diagnosis he tells the doctor to move out of the way Hes blocking his view. This is almost exactly what Diogenes told Alexander the Great after the emperor asked what he could do for the poor man and though the meaning is slightly different the eternal human struggle for answers is an unusually resonant chord for a big-budget studio movie to strike. Carter and Edwards discussion of religion hits all the essentials while being succinct and witty ""We live we die and the wheels of the bus go round and round"" says Edward. An element involving a family member that could easily have turned mawkish is instead handled with restraint that makes it more effective while a big revelation near the end which has to be hilarious is. Actors tell us that dying is easy comedy is hard. But comedies about dying are hardest of all. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next FLILFTHY THOUGHTS Read Next FLILFTHY THOUGHTS Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46764 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20339 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17970 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Bucket List The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bucket-list-the ) Bucket List The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Lately it seems every time I review a Rob Reiner movie I lament the fall this once reliable filmmaker has taken. Admittedly Reiner started at such a pinnacle that there was nowhere to go but down but its beyond consideration that the director of The Princess Bride and This Is Spinal Tap would be responsible for the likes of Rumor Has It. Thankfully while The Bucket List doesnt return Reiner to the top of his game it at least elevates him to the level of respectability. The overly melodramatic yet life-affirming screenplay is in part redeemed by the solid performances and easy camaraderie of the two veteran stars. This is one of those (rare) occasions when I was able to tune down the cynicism and enjoy it on its own terms even if there was a war at the end between my tear ducts and my gag reflex. Frank Capra would have been at home here. (His grandson is listed as a co-producer.) Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) are both afflicted with terminal cancer. Edward is a wealthy CEO with no one to visit him except his assistant (Sean Hayes) as he suffers through chemotherapy. Carter is a car mechanic who is surrounded by his wife of 47 years Virginia (Beverly Todd) and his two sons and daughter. In addition to sharing a room at the hospital the men share a diagnosis six months to a year. They make a mutual pact not to waste that time. They create a ""bucket list"" - a series of things to see and do before they die. Edwards wealth makes all things possible so they are soon jetting off to see the Pyramids of Egypt the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China among other places. They go skydiving and drive race cars and search for the perfect woman. In the end however its the little personal things that mean more to both men. The movie is essentially about these two unlikely individuals forming a friendship bound together as they are by the most forceful bond imaginable - the immediacy of their deaths. Their conversations vary from the inconsequential to the big issues. They discuss God faith and religion and Edward dismisses the idea of reincarnation because he cant figure out what a snail could accomplish to gain a next-life promotion. Writer Justin Zackham may have been trying to uncover some universal truth but if thats the case he doesnt succeed. The ""profundities"" uttered by the men are far from earthshattering or though-provoking. While the circumstances of these men are extraordinary (how many dying people get to fulfill all their wishes?) the grounded presences of Nicholson and Freeman keep things interesting. Beneath all the continent-hopping we see two genuine characters emerge men who despite their odyssey are frightened by what the future may or may not hold and are trying to come to grips with the enormity of what faces them. While there are moments when Nicholson lapses into Nicholson mode there are also plenty of scenes in which he plays the role straight with uncertainty replacing machismo. Freeman as always embodies his character. Both Edward and Carter undergo emotional journeys that occur separately yet in parallel with their physical ones. The films ending which is the continuation of a bookend that begins with the first scene offers closure. Theres enough humor sprinkled throughout to keep the movie from overdosing on its own sense of seriousness. The Bucket List is a simple movie. Its a travelogue and a road film that offers a little deeper emotional resonance than many similar films. This is obviously designed to be an Oscar calling card for both Freeman and Nicholson although its unclear whether either of them will make the cut. Their performances are strong and their name recognition will help but this is a crowded field. (Nicholson is good but I wouldnt take a slot away from Philip Seymour Hoffman for him.) The Bucket List is sentimental but its not so phony that one will be embarrassed to shed a tear or two at the end. The movies sincerity helps it get over some of the most difficult hurdles and the feeling after leaving theater is one of having experienced something worthwhile albeit unremarkable.

Its also a picture about two cancer patients confronting reality and deciding how they want to spend their presumed last days that has not an ounce of reality about it. ""The Bucket List"" is a feel-good film about death a sitcom about mortality ""Ikiru"" for meatheads. Its also a picture about two cancer patients confronting reality and deciding how they want to spend their presumed last days that has not an ounce of reality about it. For all these reasons along with the star power of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman this refitting of the grumpy old men genre stands a good chance of becoming director Rob Reiners first hit since the mid-90s even though its prevailing sensibility will eventually make it look more at home on small screens. In Reiners world the opening scene showing auto mechanic Carter Chambers (Freeman) smoking a cigarette signals that the genial fellow is headed straight to the grave. But the first stop is a hospital where hes quickly joined by gazillionaire Edward Cole (Nicholson) who despite owning the place is forced to share a room with a fellow patient due to his own rules about equal treatment for all. Although they embark on cancer treatments that allow a slight chance of survival both men are given roughly a year to live and their enforced cohabitation gives them plenty of time to ruminate about dreams regrets and remaining hopes in between slapstick emergency dashes to the bathroom. A philosophically inclined ""Jeopardy"" whiz Carter wanted to be a history professor but the demands of a growing family obliged him to face economic realities. Edward by contrast has had everything money can buy except a stable family life; married four times hes estranged from his only child a daughter. Early going is highlighted by Nicholson getting his head shaved in preparation for surgery meaning the well-fed star goes through most of the picture looking like a satiric version of the Michelin Man or a cheerier brother of Brandos Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now."" Finding some scribblings by Carter noting modest things he wants to do before he dies Edward adds to ""the bucket list"" with far more grandiose and uniquely photogenic proposals such as skydiving and racecar driving and others that involve travel by private jet a mode of transport that is the norm for Edward. So after a big argument between Carter and his understandably perturbed wife (Beverly Todd) the old boys set off for a world tour that includes the South of France South Africa the Pyramids the Taj Mahal the Great Wall of China the Himalayas and Hong Kong. Unfortunately this is a film that leaves the soundstage only with the greatest reluctance; the parade of visual effects-generated scenes in which Nicholson and Freeman visit wonders of the world while so obviously remaining in Hollywood proves as realistic as a Hope-Crosby ""Road"" picture and about as profound if not as funny. The trips patent phoniness is quaint enough to provoke momentary nostalgia for the long-gone days of rear-projection process work. The scenic sojourn during which any traces of illness are magically banished provides for saucepan-deep probing into the mens lives. The button-pushing by first-time scripter Justin Zackham remains narrowly focused on unsettled emotional issues concerning Edwards daughter with whom Carter tries to arrange a reconciliation and Carters latent misgivings about the road not taken. Resolution of these matters is assuredly provided in the most obvious manner for immediate audience uplift. Freemans hardwired straight-shooter gravitas as an actor would have wonderfully served a genuinely serious meditation on the same subject. As it is the ever-steady thesp provides a rock against which Nicholson can bounce like a crazy ball. Edwards extravagant view of life fits what the actor has become and Nicholson actually hams it up less than he might have but its still a turn in which youre watching the star and making associations between him and aspects of the material rather than the character. The role of Edwards factotum who accompanies the guys on their journey could have been conceived any number of ways to abundant comic effect but hes been written in such a dull straight-laced manner that Sean Hayes of ""Will amp; Grace"" can do nothing to bring him to life. A similar comedy-drama from Hollywoods earlier years would have featured at least a half-dozen wonderful supporting parts the lack of which is duly felt here. In keeping with the effort expended on the location visuals tech aspects are routine. The Bucket ListProductionA Warner Bros. release of a Zadan Meron/Reiner Greisman production.
