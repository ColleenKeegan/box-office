"Movie review Gangsters Paradise Jerusalema a Goodfellas for South Africa - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-South AfricaMovie review Gangsters Paradise Jerusalema a Goodfellas for South AfricaJune 11 2010|By Robert Abele Jafta Mamabolo (Young Kunene) and Motlatsi Mahloko (Young Zakes) star... (Jonathan Burger / Jerusalem...)The story of a township boy-turned-slumlord millionaire ""Gangsters Paradise Jerusalema"" is a South African crime epic with plenty of vigor violence and vengeance as one might expect from a rags-to-riches tale cut from the same cloth as ""City of God"" ""Goodfellas"" and ""Scarface."" But writer-director Ralph Ziman deserves props for his skewed take on private enterprise post-apartheid when a bright struggling man like Lucky Kunene (played by Jafta Mamabolo as a teen Rapulana Seiphemo as an adult) can learn how to go from hijacking cars in Soweto to hijacking Johannesburg tenements from negligent white landowners. Its a fresh idea with a time-and-place-specific pungency a whether its the gritty location photography by Nicolas Hofmeyer or an Afrikaner cops lament that too many years of white-authority abuse have hamstrung legitimate efforts to reduce crime a but the whole effort is undermined by an abundance of mob-movie cliches. And Zimans such a leadfoot with the storytelling pedal that such things as character motivation reflectiveness and basic logic get lost in the crackerjack pacing. Its a shame because some of his core cast a Seiphemo Jeffrey Sekele as an underworld mentor Ronnie Nyakale as Luckys childhood friend a have the kind of lived-in expressive faces worth savoring amid the chases threats and bloodshed.

The boyhood pal along for the criminal ride the idolised neighbourhood crook the disapproving mum the turncoat former associate the climactic rooftop confrontation - its all here and more in a movie which quotes from Michael Manns Heat in a key heist set piece. Writer-director Ralph Ziman strings it all together with slick competence but given that leading man Rapulana Seiphemo does a persuasive line in moral ambiguity its disappointing that the proceedings too often default to glib shoot-em-up rather than digging deeper into the historical moment. Loosely based on actual events the film suggests that while waiting for the new South Africa disgruntled township residents like Seiphemos Lucky twisted the politics of entitlement into a ready excuse for their own rampaging criminality - but ultimately cant decide whether to condemn or condone such action.

Credit Jonathan Burger/Anchor Bay Films ""Jerusalema"" in the awkward title ""Gangsters Paradise Jerusalema"" has two meanings neither of which involves the Middle East. It refers to a figurative city on a hill the promise of dignity and economic equality held out to black South Africans at the end of apartheid; and a literal one the Johannesburg neighborhood Hillbrow where that promise dissolved into poverty and rampant crime.The writer and director Ralph Ziman chose to tell the story of post-apartheid South Africa as a gangster tale loosely based on actual events. Making just his third feature in a long career devoted mostly to music videos he gorges on the stock elements of the genre the studious child entranced by the neighborhood thug (in this case a former Marxist revolutionary) the sick mother the trusting siblings the new girlfriend from the upper class the loved ones caught in the crossfire the climactic rooftop encounter. The nearly two-hour running time allows for lots of plot. The hero Lucky Kunene (Rapulana Seiphemo) goes straight not once but twice in the course of the movie. Photo Jafta Mamabolo and Motlatsi Mahloko. Credit Jonathan Burger/Anchor Bay Films Between Mr. Zimans music-video skills and his close approximation of the kinetic style of Michael Mann (a scene from Mr. Manns ""Heat"" has a key role in the plot) its easy to overlook the formulas and just enjoy the ride. It helps too that the urban setting with the distinctively eerie Hillbrow telecommunications tower always looming in the background is new (to American viewers) and interesting and that Mr. Seiphemo and Jeffrey Sekele as Luckys mentor in crime are convincing.""Gangsters Paradise Jerusalema"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language moderate violence and very brief nudity.GANGSTERS PARADISEJerusalemaOpens on Friday in New York Houston and Los Angeles.

The opening credits of ""Gangsters Paradise"" note that it was ""inspired by real events."" It would be more accurate to say that the film was inspired by Brian De Palmas ""Scarface"" and similar fare. Written and directed by music-video veteran Ralph Ziman ""Gangsters Paradise"" charts the rise of Lucky Kunene -- a South African black man who says his idols are Karl Marx and Al Capone -- from a clean-cut kid who wants to go to college to a petty crook then to a notorious gang leader and slumlord. The proceedings start promisingly with snappy lensing and a charismatic performance by hulking Rapulana Seiphemo as Lucky. But the story falls apart when Lucky improbably becomes involved with a rich white woman who has a druggie brother. The movie loses all credibility when Lucky dons a yarmulke and joins the woman for her familys Passover seder.

A classic yes but nothing like the clumsy dehumanized spectacles that have come to dominate the multiplexes during the summer months. Debra Graniks drama a big winner at this years Sundance Film Festival is spectacular for its humanity austere beauty and heart-stopping urgency. The setting is the Ozark mountains of southwestern Missouri at the present time though many of the faces might have been photographed by Dorothea Lange or for that matter Matthew Brady and the themes are timeless--love kinship the struggle to survive. The 17-year-old heroine Ree Dolly is played by Jennifer Lawrence a professional actress who doesnt seem to act so much as achieve a state of grace that combines intelligence with fierce resolve. And ferocity is required of Ree since she is the only one who can keep disaster from her familys door. ENLARGE Ashlee Thompson Jennifer Lawrence and Isaiah Stone in Winters Bone. Roadside Attractions Her task is to find Jessup Dolly her crank-cooking no-account fugitive of a father. If she fails as seems likely the marshals will evict her her young brother and sister and their blank-faced mother from the cabin that Jessup put up for bond at his trial before vanishing without a trace. The plot is plainly old-fashioned though no more anachronistic than Rees rural hardscrabble surroundings. Michael McDonoughs searching camera reminds us that we Americans live along many different time streams. On this one which flows directly from the Great Depression poverty remains so entrenched that the local small-business model is a meth lab and two prospects for postgraduate life are reflected in afternoon programs at Rees high school parenting classes and ROTC drills. Until now Ive made ""Winters Bone"" sound more like an object of admiration than the source of deep pleasure that it is but only because I dont want to soften its sharp edges. The director who worked with Anne Rosellini on adapting Daniel Woodrells novel has explored the Ozark culture without condescension or sentimentality. Her film is populated by explosive often brutal men with guns and their submissive often frightened women. Pride prevents Ree from asking for desperately needed food. (""Never ask for what ought to be offered"" she tells her little brother.) Her neighbors code of silence smothers her inquiries. (""Talking just causes witnesses"" a steely-eyed harridan tells her.) Kindness is in short supply and her quest grows ever more lonely as she penetrates the heart of her fathers personal darkness. So where does the pleasure come in? At just about every moment Ree is on screen. When shes teaching her brother and sister to shoot squirrels for food. (""You guys want these fried or stewed?"") When she confides however cautiously in an Army recruiter. (In a film thats full of surprises the recruiter is one of many minor characters who merit attention.) When she finds the courage to speak her mind. (""You have always scared me"" she tells her uncle Teardrop who is played with hair-trigger brilliance by John Hawkes. ""Thats cause youre smart"" he replies.) She is very smart as well as fearless up to a point though fearfully vulnerable. Ree is a thrilling heroine so old-fashioned that shes new and Ms. Lawrence gives her the sort of rock-solid yet poetic quality that recalls ""The Grapes of Wrath"" or the neo-realist films from Europe following World War II. The filmmaker Ms. Granik dealt with the grim realities of drug addiction in her debut feature ""Down to the Bone."" (What to make of all dem bones?) Her new film far from being a downer makes its way through harshness and hardship into hope. The Karate Kid ""Its like were brave pioneers on a quest to start a magical life in a new land"" the kids mother announces overbrightly in ""The Karate Kid"" just before they leave Detroit for Beijing. ""You could say that"" her son mutters with corrective cool. You could also say its like theyre likable tourists on a quest to plunder an endearing movie that didnt need this mediocre remake. The kid no longer Daniel but Dre is played by Jaden Smith the touchingly tender delicate-featured son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. (His mom is played by Teraji P. Henson.) The boy looks much younger than his 12 years; hes in a league of his own--a little league--compared to Ralph Macchio who was in his early 20s when he played the kid as a sturdy teenager. Size matters here. Its appalling to watch Dre being battered bruised and borderline-brutalized by Chinese counterparts of the original toughs (who this time practice a World Wrestling Entertainment variant of kung fu rather than a Rocky version of karate). The pall doesnt cover the rest of the movie. Jaden is endearing in his own way and the abstract notion of Jackie Chan in Pat Moritas role of the wise mentor almost obscures the reality of Mr. Chans zonked performance which simulates warm feelings toward the kid without risk of infectiousness. ENLARGE Bradley Cooper and Liam Neeson in The A-Team. Twentieth Century Fox The A-Team Liam Neesons Hannibal the bemuscled but seldom bemused master planner of ""The A-Team"" keeps insisting on his belief in an invisible order ""No matter how random things may appear theres a plan in everything."" Hes obviously right. In the absence of a coherent script (or in the presence of a script that like quantum mechanics puts a premium on randomness) the plan for this big-screen version of the cheerful old TV series could hardly be clearer--lay down an almost ceaseless barrage of thunderous action turn up the sensory heat for summer audiences whove taken refuge in the multiplex cold. Watch a scene from ""The A-Team"" starring Liam Neeson as Hannibal Bradley Cooper as Face Sharto Copley as Murdock and Quinton Rampage Jackson as B.A. Baracus. Video courtesy 20th Century Fox. Mr. Neeson gives the movie as much gravitas as he can without provoking giggles. Of the actors playing the other members of the team the only one with a world-class performance in his resume is Sharlto Copley the star of ""District 9."" He plays Murdock the crackpot pilot and gets to do barrel-rolls in a C-130 transport but thats about it. If youre looking for logic or finesse ""The A-Team"" can be numbing. If youre looking for good cheer hold out for egg nog at Christmas. But if youre a fan of causeless effects consequence-free causes and digital Dada let the silly times roll. Joan Rivers A Piece of Work Who would have guessed that ""Joan Rivers A Piece of Work"" would turn out to be a stirring portrait of indomitability? I thought I knew as much as I needed to know about an entertainer whos been on stage for four decades and resisted seeing this fine documentary by Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg. Yet here the filmmakers find her at the age of 75 a foulmouthed Mrs. Sisyphus pushing ever onward and occasionally upward in a world transfixed by youth and beauty. Once she was wild for the times. Her closing line she recalls used to be ""Im Joan Rivers and I put out."" Now she holds out with defiant energy and an almost maniacal focus against the encroachments of old age personal loss and dwindling bookings. (Which suddenly undwindled with a vengeance when she prevailed in of all potentially demeaning things ""Celebrity Apprentice."") Demeaning doesnt belong in her vocabulary. She could not be more candid about her willingness to accept any work that pays. Part of that is fueled by economics; shes determined to remain in the lap of luxury which includes a New York apartment that in her words ""is how Marie Antoinette would have lived if shed had money."" (I also thought I wouldnt be laughing at her jokes many of which turn out to be fresh and terrific.) But mostly shes a creature of implacable incurable and endlessly nourishing anger--at NBC and Johnny Carson who befriended and then she says betrayed her when she produced an ill-fated talk show of her own on Fox; at critics who wont give her what she wants the most validation as an actress; at the march of time and its ominous drumbeat. Sometimes her laughs are mirthless and you wonder what shes thinking. What she thinks of herself though seems perfectly if improbably reasonable--a queen of comedy who wont and shouldnt abdicate. Gangsters Paradise In South Africa where ""Gangsters Paradise"" was made the film was originally called ""Jerusalema""--a violent hymn heavy with irony to the new Jerusalem that was promised but not delivered by the nations postapartheid governments. Theres nothing heavy however about Ralph Zimans nimble and electrifying chronicle of Lucky Kunene an ardent good-hearted kid growing up to be a charismatic community organizer and then a gang boss. Lucky whos played with huge elan by Rapula Seiphemo takes inspiration where he can find it from sages as diverse as Karl Marx Al Capone and Donald Trump and from fragrant phrases like affirmative repossession a local euphemism for carjacking. The movie repossesses just as affirmatively a host of Hollywood conventions from such films as ""Scarface"" ""The Godfather"" and ""Heat."" Yet the results are startlingly original if occasionally overambitious. This is ""Tsotsi"" without the feel-good glow a tale of entrepreneurships perils and boundless pleasures.

Failing to secure a university scholarship in 1994 poverty-stricken Lucky Kunene (Rapulana Seiphemo) instead turns to carjacking and--after moving to the big bad city--to real estate scams all the while purporting to be a Robin Hood humanitarian combating his homelands racist power structure. Writer/director Ralph Ziman bends over backward stacking the deck in Luckys favor by making his light- and dark-skinned adversaries even scummier than he is. Nevertheless given that the inspired-by-real-events story has its wannabe-Scarface operate solely out of amoral self-interest any rationalized glorification of its protagonist rings false. So too does Luckys silent seething over a white woman confessing that ""when youre rich poverty seems glamorous"" since the film wantonly exploits destitution and violence for genre thrills. Though South Africas racial strife is frequently invoked sociopolitical inquiry takes a backseat to creaky gangster-cinema tropes. Still theres minor amusement in the suggestion that entrepreneurial criminality begins with a preference for Donald Trumps The Art of the Deal over the Bible.
