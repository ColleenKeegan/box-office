The combo of screwball situations and star Cameron Diaz -- whose goofiness charmed in ""Theres Something About Mary""-- has resulted in a movie that mimics the pics of the Farrelly brothers. ""The Sweetest Thing"" is a comedy that starts the date in a frisky mood but sours before its time to kiss goodnight. The combo of screwball situations and star Cameron Diaz -- whose goofiness charmed in ""Theres Something About Mary""- has resulted in a movie that mimics the pics of the Farrelly brothers but its not clear whether the original script by ""South Park"" scribe Nancy M. Pimenthal was stuffed with Farrelly-style gags or whether they were added later. Whatever happened Diazs character blithely operating by the dating rule that you dont look for Mr. Right but Mr. Right Now finds herself on an increasingly silly course losing her charm along the way. Pic will fill the love seats in stadium theaters on opening weekend but whether the leggy high heels can hold up is an open question. There is a mildly funny opening montage about men soured on dates with Diazs Christina Walters (including a crooner spoofing ""Marys"" Jonathan Richman) and the movies early section is a compact portrait of big-city gals in their late 20s who are as sexually liberated brazen and confident as possible. Theres even a sense in Christina and her lawyer roommate Courtney (an utterly matured and transformed Christina Applegate) that sex has no limits and that unlike the slightly related kin in ""Sex and the City"" they just go ahead and do it with little verbal foreplay. That this is happening in San Francisco -- depicted here as some kind of paradise for horny single heterosexuals -- appears to be due to helmer Roger Kumbles preference for cool street locations. Meanwhile roomie/pal Janes (Selma Blair) b.f. is breaking up with her. In this sex-is-fun setting Christina and Courtneys remedy for Jane is to jump right back in the pool and troll for male meat at a throbbing dance club. Pics charming high point is when Christina meets Peter (Thomas Jane) at the club by grabbing his butt. The charm isnt in the grab but in the twinkling chemistry that flows between Diaz and Jane who must be the handsomest man in Hollywood who hasnt earned his own starring vehicle. Pimenthals dialogue is snappy here as well suggesting a lot of smart sexy fun to come. Peter is in town with loud-mouth bro Roger (Jason Bateman) before a wedding up in the tony Northern California burg of Somerset. Before they part Peter invites Christina to the bash while Courtney mercilessly rags on Christina (theyre a pair of white girls who pepper their talk with the latest in hip-hop-speak) for not going to bed with him. Just as Peter cant get Christina out of his mind Christina fantasizes about him (in this libidinous pics only bed scene) to the point where Courtney orders her gal-pal to drive them both to the wedding. Although there have been a few detours along the way into broad tasteless comic business (a rather gooey dry cleaner scene involving an embarrassed Jane amidst a cavalcade of stereotyped Chinese and Irish characters) pic gives way to a string of uninspired sequences of pure Farrellyana some of which feel like filler. None of them advances the story or serve as blockades for Christina getting her man; instead an ineptly staged wedding ceremony does that job and not very well. Even though pics intro indicates that Christina is a hottie and a ruthless heartbreaker we never see the latter until she finally kisses Peter -- and finds him rather wanting. Not even Diazs charms can make this rather rancid sexual athlete attractive or even faintly amusing in the end. Diaz visibly enjoys playing the dominant lead but Kumbles laid-back direction allows her to overdo the fun stuff as if the cutting-up preserved for an outtake reel (like the four-minute one here over closing credits) were transferred to the final cut. The sloppy giddiness infects Applegate too but its somewhat inoculated by thesps wisecracking cool -- a pleasure to observe now that shes not a teen sexpot. As a third sometimes forgotten banana Blair is forced to do some of pics more disgusting bits but theyre not nearly as shocking or funny as her dark episode in Todd Solondzs ""Storytelling."" The highly charismatic Jane is barely given the screen time he deserves with his few minutes shared with Diaz merely as a teaser for a far funnier movie. In a recent disheartening trend for Hollywood comedies pic is unattractively lit shot and designed. Helmer James Mangold gamely appears in one of the few straight scenes while Applegates real-life hubby thesp Johnathon Schaech has a witty uncredited cameo as a clubber whom Applegate hits on.

Cameron Diaz Christina Applegate and Selma Blair are asked to humiliate themselves many times over in ""The Sweetest Thing"" and they do it with such game good spirits that they ought to get the actors equivalent of a Purple Heart. A sub-Farrelly gross-out comedy for guys that masquerades as a chick flick this crass romantic comedy follows the amorous and erotic misadventures of three single San Francisco roomies. Any comparison to ""Sex and the City"" is entirely unearned there is more wit and comic savvy in any two minutes of the HBO show than in all of Nancy M. Pimentals clumsy script.Commitment-phobic good-time girl Christina Walters (Diaz) is thrown off her stride when she falls for the charming Peter (Thomas Jane) at a club. ""The Sweetest Thing"" shows some charm initially but the minute Christina and her pal Courtney (Applegate) hit the road in pursuit of Peter director Roger (""Cruel Intentions"") Kumbles movie abandons all sense for scatology maggots and strained amateurishly executed slapstick about urinals and oral sex. The movie is R-rated which means that those who might laugh at these jokes will have to sneak in. Still Diaz proves once again that she can make the most superficial ditz surprisingly sympathetic and a very grown-up Applegate shows a wry deadpan comic finesse that is much better than the material deserves. The filmmakers have obviously studied ""Theres Something About Mary"" and learned nothing.

Directed by Roger Kumble from a screenplay by Nancy M. Pimental. 84 minutes. Rated R for strong sexual content and language. Several theaters. E-mail this article Print this article Related stories Devilish revenge plot drives Changing Lanes Raunchy silliness or soul-searching revenge drama? Or to put it simply fluff or plot? This weekends two biggest releases are a study in contrasts. Q How do you know when a gross-out comedy is really a chick flick at heart? A When it features an absolutely adorable cameo from a former cast member of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" ""The Sweetest Thing"" is an intriguing variant on the current raunchfest trend in comedy because it comes from a female point of view -- the screenplays by former ""South Park"" scribe Nancy M. Pimental -- and because well some of it is actually funny. Aided by the sunny presence of Cameron Diaz who floats above the flotsam with her sweetly buggy-eyed smile ""Sweetest Thing"" is not so much a movie as an amiable collection of off-color vignettes. None of them soar but some are well worth a giggle. Diaz plays Christina a chic San Franciscan who meets men and tosses them aside like empty tubes of hair-care products. When she finally meets someone who just might be Mr. Right her two pals (Christina Applegate and Selma Blair) help her develop a scheme to get to know him better. This involves various girlie adventures such as crashing a wedding doing some shopping visiting a truly disgusting public restroom and finally a sweet-natured sing-along of ""I Dont Want To Miss a Thing"" (well its sweet if you disregard the reason why theyre singing it which rivals the zipper gag from ""Theres Something About Mary""). Diaz already proved in ""Theres Something About Mary"" that shes a heck of a good sport and here she gamely prances around in her underwear (a Diaz staple) falls out of windows and totters about in too-high heels. Applegate looking like a slightly less-polished version of Jennifer Aniston makes an appealing sidekick and Blair gets a very funny scene at a dry-cleaner -- well I couldnt possibly describe it in this newspaper. Christina isnt exactly a character (come to think of it shes a female fantasy who looks like a male fantasy) and ""The Sweetest Thing"" doesnt exactly have a story; nor does director Roger Kumble bring much in terms of pacing or style. But Diaz is adorable Pimentals take on gender relations is fresh (imagine -- Diaz and Applegate en route to the wedding pause to consult a map) and then theres that ""Mary Tyler Moore"" cameo. No I wont tell you who it is -- for those who care about such things its the movies sweetest treat. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

THOMAS JANE AS PETER DONOHUE AND CAMERON DIAZ AS CHRISTINA WALTERS IN""THE SWEETEST THING."" Photo HO Sweetest Thing bitter aftertaste / Cameron Diaz falls flat in comedy 1 / 1 Back to Gallery THE SWEETEST THING Comedy. Starring Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate. Directed by Roger Kumble. (R. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Sweetest Thing"" is nothing but a showcase for the inherent comedic gifts of Cameron Diaz. The problem is she doesnt have any. Diaz does have a sense of fun a willingness to look foolish an aura of friendliness and a smile that looks genuinely warm even if its beginning to seem forced and overplayed. These are winning qualities -- but a losing bet when matched with a stink bomb of a script. ""The Sweetest Thing"" fails as a romance and as a comedy in that the love story is halfhearted and the comic moments intended to be outrageous are only shameless lifts from other funnier pictures. Theres a semen bit (""Theres Something About Mary"") a penis-getting-stuck-in-something bit (""American Pie 2"") and a clumsy-people-breaking-up-a-wedding bit (""10""). Theres also something involving a bathroom pipe snapping and everyone getting soaked the sort of thing that had them rolling in the aisles in 1914. Diaz plays Christina a San Francisco woman who flits from relationship to relationship leaving a trail of broken men who cant talk about her without freaking out or getting a nosebleed. Shes a charmer and Diaz plays her with all the misguided and flailing energy of someone whose handlers have been telling her she is Carole Lombard Lucille Ball and Goldie Hawn rolled into one. So we get the sight of Diaz stumbling up a steep San Francisco street or falling out of a window as though were watching a slapstick master at work but theres nothing there. Perhaps these moments have no kick because Diaz has no essential dignity to deflate. Or maybe its just the mystery of talent and timing. In any case the people who are telling Diaz shes funny are not her friends. One night Christina goes out to a bar and meets a nice guy named Peter (Thomas Jane). At first they dont like each other -- imagine that -- but then I dunno something in the moment . . . a special connection . . . Christina thinks he might be the one. She thinks this for reasons no one in the audience can discern but fine. Well go along for the ride. The ride in this case is a trip three hours north of the Golden Gate Bridge. After that brief encounter in the bar Christina has no way of finding Peter except she knows hes going to be at a wedding in a small Northern California town. She and her friend Courtney (Christina Applegate) decide to make the trip and most of ""The Sweetest Thing"" is about the two women on the road having laughs and adventures. Applegate is the revelation of ""The Sweetest Thing."" Formerly the teen sex bomb of TVs ""Married . . . With Children"" she has grown into an actress with an alert authoritative presence. In the movies first moments we find out that Courtney is a lawyer. Id believe it. (Diaz is supposedly an advertising executive. Stop laughing.) Yet Applegate also has a comic abandon that makes her the source of every genuine laugh. She out-acts out-funnies and out- sweetest-things Diaz up and down this movie. Someone give this woman a decent part. At 87 minutes ""The Sweetest Thing"" feels pumped up with air with an extended end-credits sequence designed to stretch the movie to a respectable feature length. Yet if as a result of people seeing her in this Applegate gets a viable career some good may come of this minor disaster. Advisory This film contains course language and sexual situations.

The Sweetest Thing Movie Review (2002) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-sweetest-thing-2002,200,thesweetestthing12,thesweetestthing,rogerebert
USATODAY.com - Sweetest Thing A toast to raunch Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/11/2002 - Updated 1027 PM ET Sweetest Thing A toast to raunch By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Sweetest Thing (out of four) Stars Cameron Diaz Christina Applegate Selma Blair Director Roger Kumble Distributor Sony Pictures Rated R for strong sexual content and language Cameron Diaz so winning as the lovable Mary who had that special something about her seems determined to keep playing that character -- but with increasingly less charm. In The Sweetest Thing shes a less innocent version of Mary a chronic player and heartbreaker whos terrified of commitment. But for someone who is so against relationships she spends a lot of time wishing and hoping and thinking and not exactly praying but dreaming about a romance with that special guy (played by Thomas Jane). Perhaps its enough for a movie like this to be sexy and raunchy. No need for its premise to make sense. In this instance the sexy part is debatable (unless you consider the sight of a fully clad woman humping a man in an elephant suit a turn-on). But raunchy it is. Though many of its grossest moments draw groans rather than guffaws and a few yawns Sweetest is occasionally and audaciously funny. Gross-out comic flicks tend to be the exclusive domain of men so its only fair that women try their hand (or other body parts) at the genre. It would help however if the filmmakers didnt fashion Sweetest like a melange of other mediocre movies. At times this feels like Dumb and Dumber meets Charlies Angels minus the action sequences. As she did in Angels Diaz preens and dances in her skivvies. She also sportingly allows herself to be the butt of a number of humiliations. Though she is sporadically funny and certainly the most endearing of the miscast trio her usually sound comic timing is sloppy and half-hearted. Christina Applegate playing the best friend part has her funniest scene not with Diaz or some dashing dude but with a bratty boy during a wedding ceremony. Much of the time she looks a bit blank and sometimes outright embarrasses herself with her frequent forced dance moves. Their buddy Selma Blair doesnt fare much better. So effective in Todd Solondzs harsh drama Storytelling Blair seems lost here. Comedy may not be her strong suit. When words fail her (though truly the fault is not hers but screenwriterNancy Pimentals) she resorts to making childish faces. And Diaz is not above mugging either. For the connoisseur of the cleverly disgusting the gross-out material here is not terribly new. There are writhing maggots to fend off a near-strangulation inflicted by an overly well-endowed hunk that inspires a lame neighborhood singalong and a surprise blow to the eye from the organ of an unidentified male. Are you laughing yet? Set in the heart of San Francisco Sweetest Thing aspires to be a cinematic Sex and the City but its more like South Park Goes West.
