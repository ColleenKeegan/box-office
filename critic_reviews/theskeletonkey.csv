Luring us into that hinterland where the solid ground of reason leaches into the treacherous swamp of superstitious belief the insidious script by Ehren Kruger (The Ring) seeps into our unconscious. Like the films young heroine we are forced to question the evidence of our senses our ability to rationalise the inexplicable. Are we witnessing mischievous mind-games mystical mumbo jumbo or frightening fact? Almost Famous star Kate Hudson reveals her more serious side as Caroline Ellis a sensible hospice nurse employed to care for the Devereaux mansions stroke-paralysed owner Ben (John Hurt). As soon as she arrives Caroline is thrown off-balance by the creepy atmosphere that pervades the house and by Bens prickly overprotective wife Violet (Gena Rowlands) who drip-feeds hints about restless spirits that must be contained. Not even the Devereauxs rational estate lawyer Luke Marshall (Peter Sarsgaard) can explain away Carolines discovery of a locked attic room stuffed with mirrors and Hoodoo paraphernalia. Krugers script for The Ring remake replaced the unsettling subtleties of the Japanese original with multiplex-friendly jumps and scares. The Skeleton Key by contrast unfolds slowly keeping us guessing for almost three-quarters of the movie. Softleys confident direction is skilfully calibrated to extract the maximum suspense and the strong dramatic performances fuse seamlessly with John Beards atmospheric production design Dan Mindels almost monochromatic cinematography and Edward Shearmurs Southern-flavoured score. Nothing is forced least of all a sly ending that bubbles up from beneath the films shimmering surface.

"Skeleton Key Unlocking a Few Thrills washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Skeleton Key Unlocking a Few Thrills Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Jen Chaney Special to The Washington Post Thursday August 11 2005 Freaky people with their eyes rolled back in their heads? Check. Clanging noises in the middle of the night? Check. Locked doors that lead to rooms filled with spooky supernatural secrets? Oh triple-check. Yes as voodoo-themed thrillers go ""The Skeleton Key"" delivers on all formulaic counts except one It never serves up any truly nightmare-inspiring scares. Still even though it elicits as many giggles as gasps ""Key"" isnt such a bad little movie. Kate Hudson bravely allows her mascara to run repeatedly in her role as Caroline Ellis a live-in caretaker to stroke victim Ben Devereaux (John Hurt) who happens to live in a creepy mansion in the swampy outskirts of New Orleans with his overprotective wife Violet (Gena Rowlands). Immediately Caroline senses something weird about the place. All the mirrors have been removed from the walls. Bens bedsheets have the words ""Help Me"" scrawled across them. And to paraphrase the lyrics of Carlos Santana it appears the Devereauxs have got a black magic attic. Like almost every psychological horror flick spawned from Hollywood these days -- from ""The Forgotten"" to ""Hide and Seek"" to 2001s exceptional ""The Others"" -- ""The Skeleton Key"" creates a mood of general foreboding sprinkles in a few spine-straightening jolts then caps it all off with a twist ending that in this case viewers may not see coming. Its all ultimately made watchable by the exceptional cast which includes the reliably compelling Peter Sarsgaard and a story that despite some unsavory racial undertones holds the audiences interest even when it veers toward the downright silly. Its the sort of movie that will make a great Friday night rental when it hits DVD shelves in a few months. As to whether its worth catching in theaters well youll just have to decide whether the spirits move you. The Skeleton Key (PG-13 104 minutes) -- Contains violence disturbing images and some partial nudity. Area theaters.

"The Skeleton Key Boo on the Bayou washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Skeleton Key Boo on the Bayou Kate Hudson plays a live-in nurse whose snooping around her employers rickety mansion unlocks a Pandoras box. (By Merrick Morton -- Universal Studios) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 12 2005 Kate Hudson plays the only 25-year-old woman in America who doesnt own a cell phone in ""The Skeleton Key"" a diverting stylish thriller that despite pivoting on that and other whoppers deserves credit for creating an authentic original vibe. Steeped in the distinctive roux of race and religion that permeates New Orleans and its outlying parishes ""The Skeleton Key"" has a swampy soulful authenticity -- and some surprisingly good performances -- placing it a notch above such mediocrities as the recent ""Dark Water."" With its ghosts attractive young woman in jeopardy and near-constant rainstorms this movie is just as psychologically spooky and atmospheric as that earlier summer film. But with its evocative setting a coolly restrained leading performance from Hudson and a truly wonderful supporting turn from Gena Rowlands ""The Skeleton Key"" is way hipper. If it finally succumbs to third-act absurdities -- the inevitable stumbling block for todays adult horror movies -- at least it gives viewers a good ride one propelled not by script doctors or computer-generated whammies but by immersing the audience in the superstitions totems and visual vernacular of its own world. That is the world of ""hoodoo"" a folk religion of the American South that combines the belief systems of voodoo Christianity and Native American practices and that depends heavily on conjuring magic spells and those supernatural forces that can be classified under the heading of ""mojo."" This is the world that Caroline Ellis (Hudson) unwittingly enters when she responds to a classified ad for a hospice nurse at a decrepit plantation outside New Orleans. There she is hired by Violet Devereaux (Rowlands) to care for her ailing husband Ben (an unrecognizable John Hurt) who has suffered a debilitating stroke after a visit to the houses attic. Violet makes a great ceremony of explaining that she had keys made to all the rooms of the house which sags with shabby elegance on the lip of a moss-draped bayou; she gives Caroline the skeleton key which opens every door including the one to the attic. Of course Caroline wouldnt want to go to the attic. None of us would want to go to the attic. But like her inexplicable failure to sign up with Cingular Verizon or other cell-phone provider Caroline insists on going up to the attic and once there to explore a mysterious secret room beyond a locked door. ""The Skeleton Key"" like its predecessors depends on a heroine who is not only gorgeous but either very brave or very stupid. Hudson who dials back her native Goldie-given charm here to give Caroline a no-nonsense brusqueness manages to convincingly convey a fearless bullheadedness rather than less sympathetic naivete. Carolines unsmiling reserve -- she might be the chilliest caregiver in the history of the hospice movement -- gives ""The Skeleton Key"" a certain dignity and even humor during some priceless exchanges between Caroline and Violet. Rowlands delivers a quietly hilarious performance as the gruff chain-smoking doyenne and her Louisiana accent is flawless when delivering the movies best dialogue (the same unfortunately cannot be said of Peter Sarsgaard who is far less convincing as Violets handsome young estate lawyer). ""Youre written on aint you?"" she asks Caroline by way of asking whether the young woman has any tattoos. ""Not where you can see"" the latter parries. As the two womens tart repartee gives way to a steely battle of the wills disbelief must eventually be suspended (has a hairpin ever really successfully unlocked a door?). But the appeal of ""The Skeleton Key"" lies not in its plot but in its attention to detail and the way director Iain Softley (still on probation for ""K-PAX"" but nevertheless the guy who did ""Backbeat"") luxuriates in the deeply textured sights and sounds of Louisiana. From the mysterious lines of red brick dust that greet visitors to back-country homes to the bones shells beads and icons that decorate nearly every location he takes full advantage of the regions rich indigenous culture. That appreciation extends as well to the movies soundtrack which is composed of vintage blues and contemporary hip-hop as well as a fictional hoodoo ritual that could pass for an Alan Lomax field recording. (""The Skeleton Key"" was written by Ehren Kruger who knows his way around a thriller having penned ""Arlington Road"" and both ""Ring"" movies.) If the action gets a little out of hand ""The Skeleton Key"" admittedly features a nifty final twist one that most viewers surely wont see coming. Even more gratifying when they find themselves mentally going over Carolines steps in order to find portents of what finally transpires they will be reentering a world worth coming back to. The Skeleton Key (104 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence disturbing images some partial nudity and thematic material.

With its claustrophobic atmosphere The Skeleton Key has some things in common with a much better film The Others. Universal Studios If its hard to imagine a tough-as-nails adversary in the form of a matronly septuagenarian in an apron then its unlikely youll buy the rest of The Skeleton Key. This born-on-the-bayou thriller stars Gena Rowlands as the unbeatable foe and Kate Hudson as a hospice worker caring for Rowlands dying husband (John Hurt). (Related item This shocking twist is...secret) The setting is alluring a ramshackle 30-room plantation house set amid swampland and mossy willows. The stately manse has seen better days and played host to several mysterious inhabitants. This is essentially a haunted-house horror flick that starts off with effectively eerie scenes but devolves into a forced and mildly ridiculous ghost story. About the movie Skeleton Key   1/2 (out of four) Stars  Kate Hudson Gena Rowlands John Hurt Peter Sarsgaard Director  Iain Softley Distributor  Universal Pictures Rating  PG-13 for violence disturbing images partial nudity and thematic material Running time  1 hour 44 minutes Opens today nationwide Hurt as a stroke victim left paralyzed and mute communicates powerfully with a hooded terrified gaze. Rowlands is generally convincing as the Southern gentlewoman with a steely core although she is given some cliched dialogue to deliver as is most of the cast. Raised by her father who died suddenly while they were estranged Hudsons character is determined to comfort the mortally ill. She goes to work at the forbidding mansion and soon finds herself investigating a sinister attic where things go bump in the night. Peter Sarsgaard plays the elderly couples lawyer with an excessively mannered Southern accent that doesnt jibe with his expressionless demeanor. Director Iain Softley employs intriguing camera angles to heighten some of the suspense. Its too bad the movie goes over the top and falls apart in the last third. With its claustrophobic atmosphere The Skeleton Key has some things in common with a much better film Alejandro Amenabars creepy The Others. But audiences may feel theyve seen this story on an episode of some old TV drama or read something like it in Nancy Drew and the Moss-Covered Mansion. Unlike the astute fictional sleuth Hudsons character is not all that perceptive. We figure out pretty much from the start who the bad guys are while she remains trusting. Its common to see youthful hard-bodied stars withstand heaps of abuse often with nary a scratch or perhaps just a tiny cut that serves only to offset their striking features. Its sort of refreshing to see a tough character look like someones grandma. But she does generate some inadvertent laughs. After plummeting spectacularly down a staircase she dusts herself off and says politely to Hudson ""Well child I believe you broke my legs."" If believable thrills and chills are what youre after The Skeleton Key provides only the bare bones.

Starring Kate Hudson Gena Rowlands John Hurt and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by Iain Softley. (PG-13 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When it comes to scary movies sometimes its better to get a C-list actress who puts in the extra effort than an A-lister who is slumming in the part. Sarah Michelle Gellar in ""The Grudge"" for example is a better bet than Halle Berry in ""Gothika."" The rule holds for Academy Award nominee Kate Hudson and ""The Skeleton Key"" a well-intentioned horror film that is weighted down by stellar cast members who for the most part act as if they dont want to be there. Sorry did we just call ""The Skeleton Key"" a horror movie? When the film stars Nicole Kidman Jodie Foster or another frequent Oscar nominee studios prefer the word supernatural thriller as if theres some artistic element to jumping up and down and screaming in your underwear. But while the underwear part is well covered in this film audiences also expect to be scared and entertained and ""The Skeleton Key"" doesnt do enough of either. Hudson is introduced as Caroline Ellis the worlds least intelligent hospice care worker who has applied for a high-paying job in a mansion bordered by swamps in southern Louisiana. Director Iain Softley takes advantage of the spooky surroundings and quickly settles into a paint-by- numbers horror story groove. (Something scary pops out of nowhere. The camera pans to something gross. Two more scary things pop out of nowhere. Someone tells Caroline not to go into the attic. Another scary popping thing. Caroline goes into the attic anyway. ...) Slowly a recognizable supporting cast is introduced including Peter Sarsgaard as a young estate lawyer and Gena Rowlands as the wife of invalid John Hurt -- not since Kevin Costner played the corpse in ""The Big Chill"" has such a recognizable actor been in a role with so little to do. And as each great actor appears and starts going through the motions the movie gets more and more difficult to watch. Attempts at banter arent genuine the attempts at humor fall flat and its more than the middling script. With every actor except maybe Rowlands you get the feeling that all lines were performed in only one take. And as nothing interesting happens onscreen theres little left to do except marvel about how stupid Hudsons character is. Lets say youre a young person and thinking fairly clearly. Would it occur to you that your employers can afford 1000 per week for a hospice worker but they cant spend 17.95 for a gallon of Glidden to paint the peeling walls something a little more cheery? Would it occur to you to notify the authorities about elder abuse? Would it occur to you to leave after discovering some freaky stuff behind a barricaded door? The first two-thirds of the movie seem to be written with the primary focus of developing scenes where Hudson can walk around half-naked. But after almost nothing notable happens for more than an hour the plot lurches into gear ending with an extremely satisfying final five minutes that almost redeem the 99 that came before it. ""The Skeleton Key"" could have made an outstanding episode of ""The Twilight Zone."" But from the moment they failed to cast Jennifer Love Hewitt in the lead this movie was doomed to failure. -- Advisory This film contains profanity violence and the forced administration of drugs which Rowlands character calls ""remedies.""

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In the cheapest brand of supernatural thriller the first to go are the cynics those who deny God Satan and all the winged creatures in between. ""The Skeleton Key"" opens a very different door into its tale of black magic in a Louisiana plantation home. Here amid the cicadas and Spanish moss refuting the darker forces may be the only way to defeat them. Thats the paradox hospice caregiver Caroline (Kate Hudson) faces and the engine that pulls the film through its early haste and contrivance toward something richly disturbing. What sort of universe do we live in for instance if God exists only when someone happens to believe in him? The particulars of ""Skeleton Key"" matter less than its excellent cast which along with Hudson includes John Hurt Peter Sarsgaard and the impeccable Gena Rowlands. Each rides out the intrusive score and trumped-up suspense - such as otherwise benign people startling Caroline - that precede the good stuff. Disgruntled with her hospice job Caroline answers an ad to look after Ben (Hurt) who recently suffered a stroke and apparently isnt long for this world. His wife Violet (Rowlands) has chased away the other help so far. But with the help of the familys courtly young lawyer (Sarsgaard) Caroline is soon unpacking her things in the mansion. It is rundown dark and spooky because I suppose we expect it to be. Violet guarded as she is about the house nonetheless gives Caroline a skeleton key that opens every door. Whats behind one in particular a dusty attic room with jars of who-knows-what and old records labeled with words like ""conjuration"" nudges her closer to understanding why the speechless Ben seems to be imploring her for help. Once the story has immersed the vaguely ambitious Caroline (she wants to earn money for nursing school) in its Gothic mystery the film feels brisk rather than hurried. A friend back in New Orleans (Joy Bryant) tells her about hoodoo a type of magic she says affects only those who subscribe to it. Not given to superstition Caroline investigates because she thinks Ben believes and will eventually be able to explain his plight. The buzz surrounding the film written by Ehren Kruger (""The Ring"") involves twists and trapdoors. But none of it would matter without Hudsons performance. While the ghosts of lynched black servants are said to roam the house Caroline often seems like the real apparition. At 25 she floats between the hazy guilt of not having been with her father on his deathbed and a blank sense of her spiritual and rational selves. Instead of sheltering her from the paranormal Carolines intellect buckles just enough to pin her under floorboards and ceiling beams. At the beginning of the film she keeps the personal effects of a recently departed hospice patient - unable it seems to bear a persons history being tossed in a Dumpster. What we come to realize is that she cant bear her own emptiness. It is a void other forces are only too happy to fill.

"The Skeleton Key doesnt do voodoo so well - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW The Skeleton Key doesnt do voodoo so well By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  August 12 2005 The credits for the new Kate Hudson voodoo thriller The Skeleton Key"" say the screenplay is by the horrorsmith Ehren Kruger and the direction courtesy of the art-film practitioner Iain Softley. But all signs suggest that the films true maker was a particularly spiteful Ouija board. This nasty little movie is communicating with regional and racial cliches from beyond the grave. Yet come the final act it manages to be insulting and somehow playfully absurd at the same time.Hudson plays Caroline a New Orleans nurse who takes a job caring for a pair of seniors in their ancient manse out in the swampy bayou. The proprietress is a bitter old lemon named Violet Devereux whom Gena Rowlands plays in a cantankerous state that feels like a sequel to the retirement-home wilding out she did in The Notebook."" Carolines responsibilities require her to bathe and clothe the droopy soul often slumped over in a wheelchair. The mans name is Ben. Hes Violets husband and the esteemed English actor John Hurt inhabits the characters drooling catatonia with troubling professionalism.Caroline tells her understandably skeptical gal pal (Joy Bryant) that she has accepted the job because itll earn her money and credits for nursing school. But really the job is good practice for her detective skills for Caroline does a lot of snooping and spying. She finds the locked door in Violets attic that the titular key opens. On the other side is a room full of antiques Violet has banned from the rest of the house. (Something in that room gave Ben his crippling fright.) But crucially Caroline learns that people in the swamps of Louisiana practice a little something called voodoo.Caroline is a white girl from Hoboken so youll have to forgive her for not knowing that if you pull into a filling station where there are shucked oysters teeming with flies and alligator heads hanging from the ceiling you peel off. Theres voodoo in the offing. Instead she waits for a pair of scary-looking black people to materialize from a back room to let her know that something aint right.To explain what is ultimately inexplicable The Skeleton Key"" trots out the back story of two black servants from many decades ago who caused an uproar with their witchy ways. At a big mansion soiree the butler Papa Justify (Ronald McCall) and the maid Mama Cecile (Jeryl Prescott Sales) are caught conjuring"" on their masters cute blond tykes who appear to be having a ball sitting amid certifiable evil. (Alas black magic.)The appalled white party guests promptly lynch and then burn the help and the news is presented to us in a scratchy black-and-white flashback that looks like a D.W. Griffith music video complete with Justify and Ceciles beckoning to the camera their eyes rolling back in their skulls and their bodies shivering with erotic possession. In the present no time is wasted (even if quite a bit of money and talent were) to show us a lot of chicken bones brick powder and sweaty suspicious black people all of which has some lurid bearing on Caroline and her new job.What specifically Im not at liberty to say. But the movie contains what feels like a bad satirical joke on Hollywoods timeless casting philosophy when it comes to race. The gag shows up in the last 10 minutes and is stuffed in a plot twist that pops out like an airbag after a car crash. The filmmakers shove their way right past the flagrance of the racial images as if theyd lost their power to hurt or annoy. (They havent.) Yet the movie might have justified some of its offenses had the star been Bryant an alluring young African-American actress who isnt hired enough. Come the last 10 minutes it also would have made more narrative sense.In any case the movie just has fun reducing loaded racial imagery to commercial silliness. Caroline winds up squaring off against Violet and the estimable Peter Sarsgaard is dragged into the mounting hilarity as Violets attorney. (Until the finale Hudsons participation remains uncharacteristically zestless.)None of The Skeleton Key"" is scary or necessarily suspenseful. But Softley who pulled off an improbably inspired adaptation of Henry Jamess The Wings of the Dove"" in 1998 appears to be enjoying himself with this slummy little movie. It has the wild rancid atmosphere of a garbage bag that a raccoon has ripped open.The filmmakers find their footing the last 20 minutes. Its trashy ominousness is best captured when Rowlands comically tells a wary Hudson You havent touched your gumbo."" That she hasnt amounts to the only twitch of common sense in the whole film.

"Skeleton Key The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; skeleton-key-the ) Skeleton Key The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Skeleton Key is the latest of the new breed of PG-13 ""horror"" movies that emphasize atmosphere and ""boo"" moments over gore. This film which is not a re-make of a Japanese production (as many of these pictures are) maintains an internal logic that allows the viewer to follow the storyline without becoming confused or losing interest. There are weaknesses - the narrative traverses a predictable trajectory the pacing is uneven and there are times when the action goes over-the-top. But the heroine is smarter than the average horror movie scream queen and the ending doesnt cheapen proceedings. (Actually one could argue that the ending is the best thing about The Skeleton Key.) Ghosts dont play much of a role in The Skeleton Key. They occasionally make appearances around the periphery of the story but never enter the cross-hairs. This is more about hoodoo/voodoo and other forms of black magic. The scares come from things that go bump in the night rather than from ghostly apparitions making visitations. But these are the bayous of Louisiana where stranger things can be found than dead men walking. Caroline Ellis (Kate Hudson) is a Jersey girl who has moved to New Orleans for school. For her flexible work hours are important and she finds them as the live-in caregiver for Ben Devereaux (John Hurt) an elderly Southern gentleman who has suffered a stroke. Caroline is expected to tend to him twice a day - once in the morning and once at night. Dealing with Bens old-fashioned wife is a challenge. Violet Devereaux (Gena Rowlands) doesnt like the idea of someone invading her turf especially if that someone has ""writing on her body"" (even if its where no one can see) and lacks a Southern accent. Because the old house is far enough off the beaten path the only one who comes to visit is Violets lawyer Luke (Peter Sarsgaard) who becomes Carolines confidant when she notices strange things happening in the attic. If one breaks it down The Skeleton Key is more of a mystery than a horror movie. Caroline is the detective. She follows clues uncovers evidence and begins to piece together a bizarre puzzle. Along the way there are red herrings. And all is revealed - at least the little the viewer will not have guessed by that point - at the end. Key to the narrative is Carolines character arc as her experiences convert her from a skeptic to a believer. The transformation is handled believably; it doesnt happen too quickly to strain credulity. And its crucial because hoodoo at least according to screenwriter Ehren Kruger (The Ring The Ring 2) works only on those who believe in it. In picking their lead actress the filmmakers have gone against type by casting Kate Hudson - she of the 100-watt smile and winsome disposition. Here she plays ""serious"" well and while no one will confuse Caroline with Sherlock Holmes she makes the part her own. Gena Rowlands and John Hurt are solid but unremarkable. Hurt has to do most of his acting with his eyes and brows since Bens stroke has rendered him unable to speak. So we get a lot of wild-eyed panicked looks. Peter Sarsgaard doesnt have much to do although the law of conservation of characters indicates hell have a part to play before the end credits roll. If theres a disappointment its that directory Iain Softley (K-PAX) fails to exploit the setting. The Skeleton Key is the kind of movie in which you expect the swamps and bayous to take on a life of their own almost becoming another character. But it never happens. The rural Louisiana landscape is little more than a colorful backdrop. Softley never grasps the kind of overpowering atmosphere thats needed to elevate a motion picture like this. The Skeleton Key delivers its share of cheap scares but never unlocks the door to the creepiness that would have made this is memorable movie-going experience.

Yet the spiritual tradition that invented them -- Afro-Caribbean voodoo -- rarely gets the spotlight serving mostly as a genre backdrop for all-too-familiar stories about good-looking white people in over their heads (e.g. Angel Heart). Naive hospice caretaker Caroline (Kate Hudson) certainly falls into that category but The Skeleton Key a basic bayou thriller distinguished by a very self-conscious subversive streak rises nicely above C-level. ""Hoodoo"" were informed is different than voodoo. (Its a la carte folk-magic whereas voodoo is a bona fide religion.) All of this is news to Caroline a caretaker whos taking a crash course in ""conjuration"" because she believes its connected to the catatonia of her latest sickly charge Ben (John Hurt). Blocking her path is Bens wife a honey-tongued battle-ax named Violet (Gena Rowlands having a blast) who complains rightly that this Yankee interloper doesnt ""understand the house."" Because the house of course has a past. Thats clear from one look at its rotting plantation colonnades. It comes as no surprise to learn it might be haunted. Ditto the revelation that once upon a benighted time a pair of black servants were terminated shall we say with prejudice. But what comes next depending on your point of view is either a canny manipulation of racist movie tropes or an exercise in facile genre-flick reductivism. The distinction may not matter For anyone zombified by creaky thriller cliches Skeleton is a fine little shot in the head.

Fright show tilts more toward psychological terror than the paranormal themes of most of the recent horror wave but B.O. results will be similarly scary. Stirring up a humid Gothic mood and amassing a gifted roster of actors ""The Skeleton Key"" is unable to ward off the nasty spirits of formula screenwriting. Recipe mixes equal parts Deep Southern hoodooand Stephen King lite in one messy gumbo pot while undermining scientific reason for a few scares. Fright show tilts more toward psychological terror than the paranormal themes of most of the recent horror wave but B.O. results will be similarly scary with a good opening frame followed by a precipitous drop-off to a vid landing. Like most of director Iain Softleys work (""K-PAX"" ""Wings of the Dove"") his latest film centering on the clash between a hospice nurse and a dogged old lady in a possibly haunted New Orleans plantation home looks fabulous and feels empty at the core. Much of the hollowness derives from a script by Ehren Kruger (author of ""Arlington Road"" the pair of Yank remakes of ""The Ring"" and the upcoming ""The Brothers Grimm"") so slavish to standard storytelling devices and plot points that it plays more like a Robert McKee class assignment than an organic authentically told yarn. Fed up with the hospital practice of treating deceased patients like cargo 25-year-old nurse Caroline (Kate Hudson) answers an ad for a hospice nurse at a mansion in the furthest depths of the bayou. There she finds aged homeowner Violet (Gena Rowlands) taking care of her stroke-victim husband Ben (John Hurt). Violet is instantly doubtful of Jersey-born Caroline whom she says ""wouldnt understand the house."" The familys sneaky-looking estate lawyer Luke (Peter Sarsgaard) urges Caroline to stay despite past nurses having quit or been fired. Caroline finds herself in a community infused with believers of the American folk magic tradition known as hoodoo (not to be confused Carolines helpful friend Jill (Joy Bryant) reminds with voodoo). Violet gives Caroline an old-fashioned skeleton key that can open every door in the 30-room house and Caroline finds an attic stuffed with hoodoo paraphernalia including old recordings of a fellow named Papa Justify casting a ""sacrifice"" spell. One of several clumsy expository asides -- this one from Violet -- informs Caroline about the houses history of murder suicide and the lynching of house servant Justify caught teaching hoodoo secrets to the owners children. Ben aptly observes -- long after its clear to auds -- that Caroline behaves more like a detective than a nurse and her visits to him mostly involve calming him down. Still despite his supposed stroke Ben manages to crawl out of his bedroom window and fall off the roof. Reading Bens behavior and various clues as signs hes actually under a vicious spell cast by Violet Caroline bones up on hoodoo. Yet theres a paradox the movie can never quite square The folk magic works only if one believes in its power but as a medical worker Caroline trusts in scientific reason. Still she reckons if Ben believes in the hoodoo hooey then anything that can break Violets spell may work. Pic grows exhausted even while developing a more jittery tone (stoked by composer Edward Shearmurs shock music) as Caroline meets Violet in a ludicrous pitched battle during a torrential nighttime rainstorm. After being drugged pushed over a railing and down a long flight of stairs the old gal is up for one more fight -- leading the viewer to the conclusion that hoodoo potions must also include a dash of Wheaties. At the heart of ""The Skeleton Key"" is a disbelief not in magic but in the power of movies to set mood. Pics dependency on a hamfisted plot handicapped by too much exposition and obvious character types works against the ominous atmospherics Softley cinematographer Dan Mindel (working in crystalline widescreen) and production designer John Beard conjure up in infinitely more convincing and visceral ways. Even the guilty pleasure of watching world-class actors slum it up in a summer entertainment grows thin after a while starting with Rowlands who not only never seems thoroughly convincing as a decaying Louisiana matriarch but is forced into some literally embarrassing positions. Working up some real tension and sweaty stress Hudson takes a welcome break from her usually sunny persona while more and more resembling mother Goldie Hawn as she matures. Hurt almost too intensely delivers the equivalent of a silent film perf while Sarsgaard is allowed to telegraph his characters real intentions much too soon.
