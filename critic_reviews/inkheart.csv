"Inkheart A page turner so to speak | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentInkheart A page turner so to speakSo much of life is down to good luck and good timing.Brendan Fraser is a single parent with a deep dark secret in Inkheart.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Jan. 23 2009 Starring Brendan Fraser Eliza Hope Bennett Paul Bettany Helen Mirren and Andy Serkis. Directed by Iain Softley. 106 minutes. At major theatres. PG  So much of life is down to good luck and good timing.Article Continued BelowWhich is why a studios decision to hang on to the fanciful fable Inkheart for a year and release it now has torpedoed both with a depth charge labelled Bedtime Stories.When you learn Inkheart is the tale of a dad who has the magical ability to make a books characters and events leap off the page when he reads aloud what do you think? Bet it starts with ""Adam Sandler.""Which is a shame because Inkheart has more to offer with plenty of thrills a smart although oft-confusing script delightful scenery-chewing scenes from stalwarts like Helen Mirren Jim Broadbent and Andy Serkis and a gorgeous high-concept visual style.In this film based on the bestseller by Cornelia Funke Brendan Fraser does his usual level-headed dad number as Mo Folchart a single parent with a deep dark secret and a curious book-loving daughter Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett). Mo and Meggie travel around snowy medieval-looking European towns as he repairs rare and ancient books and she acts as sidekick. Mo keeps scouring the old bookstores for something special and on one trip all is revealed thanks to a moody fire juggler named Dustfinger (Paul Bettany). He blows Mos cover. Mos a Silvertongue someone who can lure characters and scenes from books into the real world just by reading aloud. And Dustfinger is very anxious to have Mo ""read"" him back into Inkheart - the volume the book doctor has so diligently been searching for.But the gift for bringing words to life comes with a hefty price - actually several of them. When a character is read out of a book someone goes in to take their place and Mos wife Resa (Sienna Guillory) is stuck somewhere between Inkhearts pages.Besides Dustfinger Mos reading also released the deliciously evil Capricorn (The Lord of the Ringss Andy Serkis) who has no desire to go back into Inkheart. This world offers too many pleasures right down to duct tape. Capricorns creepy castle is inhabited by all sorts of formerly book-bound creatures and humans all with dramatic script marking their faces and bodies read out of books by his resident Silvertongue. But the fellow isnt getting the job done so Capricorn sends his henchmen to kidnap Meggie and force Mo to read up some riches to pay the palace bills.(Reading Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves acts like a literary ATM.)With the aid of loopy turban-wearing Aunt Elinor (a faded aristocrat type played with gleeful over-the-top abandon by Mirren) Mo heads off to Capricorns castle to rescue Meggie. The intensity of some scenes and the missing mom will challenge the smaller set and those who havent read Funkes book may be left scratching their heads more than once.But all the fantasy is wrapped in a strong message for youngsters that reading is a superb means of escape even if you have to go to a movie for the inspiration to pick up a book.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Brendan Fraser is shown in a scene from ""Inkheart."" Photo Murray Close AP Silvertongue brings characters to life but should he? 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Inkheart Action fantasy. Starring Brendan Fraser Helen Mirren Sienna Giullory and Paul Bettany. Directed by Iain Softley. (PG. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The public spends January savoring the December movies but film critics alas dont have that option. The moving finger writes and having writ moves on - to movies such as ""Inkheart"" a sour little fantasy from director Iain Softley. Seemingly intended as a celebration of the power of books its an occasionally incoherent sleep-inducing picture that reduces narrative to mere mechanics. Directed by Iain Softley who has made better movies (""Wings of the Dove"") and written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Lindsay-Abaire who adapted Cornelia Funkes novel ""Inkheart"" takes what might have been an imaginative premise and renders it in pedestrian turns. Brendan Fraser plays a regular guy who just happens to possess a rare talent that he at first doesnt even know he has When he reads stories out of a book the characters come to life in the real world. Because of this talent he is known in the underworld as a ""Silvertongue"" a name that becomes kind of ridiculous when Fraser clumsily reads a story to his young daughter in the movies first scene. Silvertongues taste in reading matter is peculiar too. He chooses an obscure novel called ""Inkheart"" which depicts an ugly medieval-like fantasy world full of villains and monsters and with no happy ending. Its a conceit of the movie that whenever a Silvertongue releases something from the world of books someone disappears from the real-life world and enters the world of story. The narrative utility of this is clear Its there to prevent the Silvertongue from using his gift to get himself out of trouble. He could for example read Superman into the movie who would then solve everything in less than a minute - and resolve the entire movie in 20 minutes tops. But Silvertongue cant do that because the last time he read characters into the world his wife disappeared. He wont risk another tragedy. Unfortunately there are two negative consequences of this switch-and-subtract story element. The first of lesser importance is that it introduces a logistics problem that is never resolved. (What happens to the people who are stuck in the fantasy world? Do they get to influence the world of fantasy and change the course of literature?) The second a much deeper problem is that the device takes the one imaginative and potentially delightful aspect of the film - the prospect of story characters coming to life - and subdues it. What were left with is hardly inspired. Twelve years after the disappearance of his wife Silvertongue is pursued by the wicked characters he released. They need his reading powers to loose yet more evil beings from the underworld and once they capture him and his now-teenage daughter (Sienna Guillory) the movie adopts the typical contours of an action movie. Yet ""Inkheart"" is even worse than most action movies in that it keeps a toe in whimsy and this turns the film into an unpleasant hybrid - a childrens fantasy in which everything has a sour cast an action movie in which nothing is to be taken seriously. Theres no heart no working metaphor to the story. ""Inkheart"" is just a caper about a device and its difficult to follow probably because it doesnt make a viewer want to follow it. Helen Mirren turns up as Frasers aunt an outspoken bookworm. Midway through the movie the aunt announces that she is going home and leaving the adventure. Later she makes a perfunctory reappearance to little effect. But in the moment ""Inkheart"" is so awful that one really wonders if this isnt Mirren simply bailing on the movie. -- Advisory Scenes of peril.

Brendan Fraser plays Mo a dad who when reading a story to his baby daughter discovers that he is a ""Silvertongue"" - characters he reads about come to life. Also someone from real life disappears into the book hes reading so he loses his wife. Twelve years later Mos now-adolescent daughter Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett) has for unknown reasons a prim British accent ""I dont undahstand ah-tall"" The two of them roam the world looking in used bookstores (these days theyre in the Alps) for a copy of the rare book ""Inkheart"" which Mo was reading when his wife disappeared. A character from the book (Paul Bettany) who can shoot fire from his palms (not a terribly useful gift unless its a world without matches) trails after Mo and Meggie whining like a sullen teen demanding to be ""read back"" into the book where his ladylove awaits - shes Jennifer Connelly in an unbilled cameo. Every 5-year-old will be wondering why Mos search doesnt begin and end with Amazon.com but that isnt the silliest part of the movie. Meggie is also a Silvertongue a gift she discovers while visiting her batty great-aunt (Helen Mirren). Yet no one on-screen is curious about how far this Silvertongue gift goes. It goes pretty far far enough to end the movie in an instant. Any words a Silvertongue reads even words they have just scribbled on their arms a second ago can work magic so either father or daughter could just dream up the story twist they want and make it real. Actually the movie should be over before it starts since both father and daughter would have known this by the time the girls mom vanished. Meggie and especially Mo are so bland that the movie expends lots of time on the troubled fire-juggler Dustfinger who frets about whether he is a good guy or a bad guy. Director Iain Softley could have handled him with something like the whimsy of the Jasper Fforde ""Thursday Next"" novels - witty romps through the classics. Instead Dustfinger is a mope and the rules of the game are never clear. At times he is limited by the way he is written. Other times he seems to have free will. So which is it? The same rules problem goes for the Silvertongues. It should be fun to figure out the system with them as they go but instead random chance seems to determine which character steps in or out of a story they read. To make things extra painful there is much cutting to nonfunny comic-relief characters whose idea of banter is lines like ""If you dont stop shaking Im gonna stick you with a pin."" Theres a ferret an assortment of henchmen Jim Broadbent as the nerdy author of ""Inkheart"" (""Im sorry"" he says ""but Im afraid all of the henchmen blend into one - even to me."" Exactly.) and a boy from the ""Arabian Nights"" who speaks a Manuel-on-""Fawlty Towers"" pidgin while fumbling with unfamiliar modern items. Every so often Softley whips up a special-effects extravaganza such as a cyclone Mo reads into reality from ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" and a climax involving a giant assembled out of smoky clouds who looks like a charcoal sketch of the Mummy. Flying monkeys a minotaur and the gravestone of Ebenezer Scrooge drop in and out like union workers who punch their time cards and then quit for the day. At one point the crabby Mirren figure bursts dramatically into the action on a unicorn although the drama is partially limited by the fact that she has nothing to do when she gets there. A sign on her characters house that reads ""Dont even think of wasting my time"" would have been better placed on her agents door. kyle.Smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next HEATED EXCHANGE FRIES SCARBOROUGH FEED Read Next HEATED EXCHANGE FRIES SCARBOROUGH FEED Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 36605 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 18975 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 18509 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

The characters described below or even the actors who play them could suddenly form from the ether and plop through your kitchen ceiling interrupting breakfast. There you are nursing your hot cuppa caffeine minding your own business. Then boom Brendan Fraser materializes in the Grape-Nuts. And as soon as he arrives he starts complaining. He has needs. He wants to return to his cozy little existence in his obnoxious little movie review where he and his fellow castmates can vie for space in the plot synopsis while some omniscient narrator validates his life. For that to happen youll once again have to read this thing aloud. Only now you risk swapping Fraser for Helen Mirren in a turban and believe me shell whine even louder about wanting to get back. So dont even start. Just keep your trap shut while learning of Inkheart a passable busily plotted kids film about supernaturally gifted readers who bring to life whatever they read aloud. As such it bears some resemblance to Bedtime Stories a not-so-terrible Adam Sandler vehicle and The Fall a gorgeous (if violent) e tude on the terrifying emotional force of a childs imagination. But Iain Softley (The Skeleton Key) is going for something betwixt and between. He and screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire adapting the first of Cornelia Funkes popular Inkworld novels (Tintenwelt in the original German) combine a hefty load of cinematic whimsy with whispered declamations on the power of the written word. Turns out its not always benign; it can hurt confuse and kill. ""The written word -- its a powerful thing. You gotta be careful with it"" says Mo Folchart (a subdued Fraser) an antiquarian book doctor with a teenage daughter (Eliza Hope Bennett) and a dangerous gift. Hes a ""silvertongue"" one in a secret breed of mortals who breathe life into fiction by giving it voice. Mo had no idea he belonged to this exclusive club until one evening nine years earlier when he was reading a fantasy called Inkheart and he got to the part with the villain and his hideous band of flunkies. Then abracadabra there they were the wicked Capricorn (Andy Serkis the human behind Gollum in The Lord of the Rings and King Kong) and his sidekicks along with a suffering fire-juggler named Dustfinger (Paul Bettany). In the chaos Mos wife (Sienna Guillory) was whisked into the novel. Since then Mo has schlepped around the Alps in search of another copy of the book so he can read her home. Capricorn has other ideas He wants to harness Mos abilities for nefarious aims. Thus he tracks him down with the help of Dustfinger wholl do just about anything to get back to his own wife in Inkheart. (Thats Jennifer Connelly or Mrs. Bettany to you.) Before long Mo his daughter and his wifes turbaned auntie ( Mirren) are in the clutches of Capricorn who lives in a fortified mountain village with stuttering ""silvertongue"" Darius (John Thomson) and assorted doofus minions in Sex Pistol hairdos. The best of the bunch played by Steve Speirs wears what appears to be a prosthetic boiled potato where his nose should be. Darius weak attempts at reading have brought forth a few unfortunate creatures including some dejected-looking winged monkeys from the land of Oz. A kid named Farid (Rafi Gavron) tumbles out of Arabian Nights; he and his harem pants hook up with the good guys who track down Inkhearts dithery author (Jim Broadbent) and take part a fiery climactic maelstrom inspired best guess by a childrens theater production of ""Das Rheingold."" The films storybook Alpine vistas are lovely to behold and bits of humor pop out in welcome moments (nice duct-tape joke). Other than that it never quite springs to life as intended -- not in your kitchen and not on screen. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Onitsuka Tiger Unisex Ultimate 81 Shoes for 28 + free shipping KeySmart 2.0 Compact Key Organizer for 10 + free shipping Tommy Hilfiger via eBay Clearance Sale Extra 50% off + free...

Comments click to enlarge Inkheart Rated PG  2009 This old-fashioned winningly sincere childrens fantasy stars Brendan Fraser as a ""book doctor"" who cares for old tomes and has the magical ability to summon characters from books to life. Years earlier he accidentally released into the present day an assortment of unsavory characters from a medieval adventure story and now they threaten him and his preteen daughter (Eliza Hope Bennett). Adapted from a book by German childrens writer Cornelia Funke the movie begins to seem a little overloaded and gimmicky once characters from childrens classics begin turning up (including Toto from The Wizard of Oz) but its handsomely mounted with supporting turns by Helen Mirren as the girls flinty aunt and Jim Broadbent as the author of the book that caused so much fuss. Iain Softley (The Wings of the Dove) directed. PG 106 min. By J.R. Jones Official Site www.inkheartmovie.comDirector Iain SoftleyWriter David Lindsay-Abaire and Cornelia FunkeProducer Iain Softley Diana Pokorny Cornelia Funke and Barry MendelCast Brendan Fraser Paul Bettany Helen Mirren Jim Broadbent Andy Serkis Sienna Guillory Eliza Hope Bennett and Rafi Gavron Trailer Inkheart Now Playing Sorry there are no upcoming showtimes for Inkheart Reviews/comments Subscribe to this thread By Email Subscribing...

"Inkheart adventure doesnt jump off the page - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Inkheart Adventure doesnt jump off the page By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / January 23 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + As the hero of ""Inkheart"" Brendan Fraser possesses what in the movies lately passes for a superpower He can read. And when he does so aloud the details and characters of any story can come to life.""Inkheart"" presents that gift as a curse. Frasers character Mo Folchart a bookbinder spends the film trying to find a rare copy of a fantasy that shares its title with the movies. It seems that when his teenage daughter Maggie (Eliza Hope Bennett) was a baby Mo read the books villains off its pages and read his wife onto them. He also read its protagonist Dustfinger (Paul Bettany) out too. Dustfinger hounds Mo to read him back to his fictional world. Mo meanwhile just wants a reunion with his wife.I wish I could report that the adventure awaiting all parties involved including paying customers is something to see. In fact its hard to fathom (why doesnt Mo just order a copy from Alibris.com?) and tougher to follow. Where on earth are we exactly? A trip to Italy does turn up Helen Mirren in high spirits and higher turban as Mos aunt. But most of the time it looks like were on the back lot for a Romanian production of ""Lord of the Rings IV.""Andy Serkis who so memorably lent his voice and likeness to Gollum in the ""Rings"" movies is more human here sniveling through his part as the movies chief baddie. Never mind that he is dressed like a starlets bodyguard. Hes having a good time. So is Jim Broadbent as the books author. It takes him his beret and his giant pink scarf far too long to start sashaying through the dreary sets and narrative mud.Broadbent and Mirren are the only actors who appear to appreciate the shabbiness of the shenanigans afoot. The rest of the cast is saddled with bad clothes useless flashbacks (some of which have Bettanys actual wife Jennifer Connelly mewling across time ""Come home"") and worse wigs. The only exciting set piece is from the effects department and its a giant charcoal cloud that appears during the films climax and requires Maggie to do public reading (alas shes inherited her fathers gift).That sequence takes forever to get off the ground and longer to end. Like many other scenes in ""Inkheart"" which the playwright David Lindsay-Abaire adapted from Cornelia Funkes novel it draws the most evocative images from other material namely L. Frank Baums ""The Wizard of Oz."" Toto and the twister make pivotal cameos. So does a copy of Jean Giraudouxs ""The Madwoman of Chaillot"" which the filmmakers use as a pun that goes nowhere.How disappointing that a movie about the powers of literacy has been made by people who appear to be cinematically illiterate. Most scenes sit on the screen like bullfrogs waiting for something to happen. (Fittingly enough when something does its usually a belch.) The director Iain Softley once made a ravishing underappreciated version of Henry Jamess ""The Wings of the Dove."" He couldnt be farther from the beauty heat and perception of that film.""Inkheart"" illustrates an obvious problem with making a movie about the joys of reading when the movie made is labored and sludgy looking Why bother seeing it if you can stay home and read a book instead?Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

With Brendan Fraser Helen Mirren Paul Bettany. Director Iain Softley (146). PG Fantasy action. At area theaters.A kids adventure movie can be a lot of things -- wild and woolly loosey-goosey full of foolishness -- but they should never be shabby. And thats the best word for ""Inkheart.""Sure theres the nice message about the importance of books straight from Cornelia Funkes young adult novels. But its as if the filmmakers knew a movie of Funkes trilogy couldnt compete with a preteens imagination so they basically borrowed Harry Potters costume department. And for tone they ripped a page from ""Jumanji"" ruining an undeniably cinematic plot.Mortimer (Mo) Folchart (Brendan Fraser) and his 13-year-old daughter Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett) are rifling through bookstores in European villages for an obscure novel called ""Inkheart"" that holds the secret to Meggies moms disappearance. Yet Mo hasnt told Meggie hes a ""Silvertongue"" who can make fictional things real by reading stories aloud. (Silvertongues read about Huck Finns raft for example and -- wham It falls from the sky.)Theyre being followed by the mysterious Dustfinger (Paul Bettany) who can make fire in his hands. Dustfinger leads Mo Meggie and Aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren) to the ""Inkheart"" tales nasty villain Capricorn (Andy Serkis). The only way to get Capricorn back on the page is to find the stuffy author (Jim Broadbent) who created him.Its annoying how the movie changes its rules willy-nilly -- like how books that lose characters can draw in actual people except when characters are only partly read aloud (those wind up with words tattooed on their skin). And no explanation for Silvertongues is offered. Mo and Meggie like Dustfinger the winged monkeys of Oz a young thief from ""1001 Arabian Nights"" and the rest who pop out of literature just accept the hocus-pocus and move on.Worse are the movies herky-jerky action junky look and cheap diorama-style locales. Jumping about the spit-and-polish sets Fraser appears extra-goofy -- hes not out of place (he knows family movies are his forte) he just looks like he could break Capricorns fake-looking castle. Even the marketing budget was apparently too low to hype the Oscars won by Mirren Broadbent and in a cameo Jennifer Connelly (Bettanys wife). Only Mirren stands out from the noise in the Ian McKellen wise-old-bird role.At one point the movies theme is summed up ""The written word is a powerful thing."" Absolutely kids. Close that laptop and crack open a book. The magic youll find will certainly be better than this uninspired film. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Mark Kelly looks back at the series which includes The Bourne Identity The Bourne Supremacy The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Legacy. Image Universal Pictures/Everett Collection By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 29 2016 710 p.m. ET 79 COMMENTS Heres to truth in advertising. Go to the official website for "" Jason Bourne"" and what pops up immediately is a nonstop loop of riots raging fires car chases car crashes and brutishly ugly hand-to-hand combat interspersed with occasional glimpses of Matt Damons scowling countenance. Loops are by definition nonstop and the only way you can get rid of this one is to close the window. Still its a fair representation of the movie which puts its hero through a much longer loop of heavy-duty punishment interspersed with familiar sequences of omniscient electronic surveillance. Bourne used to be an anguished amnesiac. Now he remembers who he is but this fourth episode of the franchise forgot to make him human. Instead of using the last pieces of his self-discovery to open him up the film makes him more tightly shut down than ever a relentlessly grim avenger who wants to expose yet another nefarious program being hatched by a CIA that aspires to ""full-spectrum surveillance"" or watching everyone all the time. The chases are exciting up to a point; the director Paul Greengrass is a virtuoso filmmaker. But oh how they do vroom on. And when Bourne isnt being chased by a villainous agency assassin played by Vincent Cassel or by cops in various countries who do the agencys bidding hes being tracked by an array of technologies that give new meaning to whats become an obligatory phrase in high-tech thrillers ""Give me eyeballs on him."" (The most prominent snoops are the CIAs director Robert Dewey who is played by Tommy Lee Jones and his deputy Alicia Vikanders Heather Lee.) More Reviews Gleason Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films Those all-seeing eyes of a digital god include as in previous episodes satellites a seeming infinitude of CCTV cameras and facial recognition systems that can pick Bournes face out of every crowd he tries to hide in. Omniscient surveillance has to be sure become an action-thriller staple even though it drains suspense by making chases easier just as computers have weakened police procedurals by making investigations easier. Whats newish here is the numbing amount of time the film spends on people halfway around the globe watching Bourne on myriad screens while giving his pursuers turn-by-turn directions that Waze users could only dream of. If you want to be generous toward the all-the-worlds-a-network screenplay that Mr. Greengrass wrote with the films editor Christopher Rouse its a lively sampling of themes ripped from the headlines or from classic films cyberwarfare; Edward Snowden; ""The Terminator"" (the villain drives a destructo truck); ""The Manchurian Candidate""; the cybersecurity conflict between personal privacy and public safety ( Riz Ahmed is Aaron Kalloor aka Steve Zuckerberg Gates a Silicon Valley titan whos been in bed with the CIA and wants to climb out). But if youre not feeling generous--and I leaned to the Not side after less than an hour--its a collection of repetitive tropes that Mr. Rouses pumped-up editing has turned into a two-hour version of a 100-yard dash. ( Barry Ackroyd did the flashy cinematography.) Watch a film clip from Jason Bourne starring Matt Damon and Julia Stiles. Photo Universal Pictures Mr. Damon is as always a strong presence; its remarkable that he can do such a buoyant man on Mars and such a dour Jason Bourne. Ms. Vikander taking over where Joan Allen left off makes up in appealing ambiguity what she lacks in Ms. Allens steeliness. Julia Stiles is back and welcome as Nicky Parsons. Mr. Jones has been made up--some of that is makeup isnt it?--to look like a cross between Lucifer and Nixon and he does his airy-authority number with well airy authority. He also gets--and earns--what is by my count the only laugh in the entire film. You dont go to a Bourne movie to laugh of course but neither do you go to get worn down. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download The Martian (2015) Matt Damons astronaut Mark Watney doesnt just struggle to survive on Mars after his crew assumes he has died during an epic storm and leaves him behind. He lives a rich intense life sustained by wry humor piercing intelligence and an irrepressible spirit of invention. Knowing the premise wont prepare you for the remarkable variety and complexity of this sci-fi extravaganza which Ridley Scott directed from Drew Goddards exuberant adaptation of the Andy Weir novel. 47 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Pictures In a world where books can become reality Fenoglio (Jim Broadbent center) finds his original manuscript for Inkheart as Mo (Brendan Fraser left) and Dustfinger (Paul Bettany) grab at the pages. ABOUT THE MOVIEInkheart  1/2 out of four Stars Brendan Fraser Eliza Hope Bennett Helen Mirren Paul Bettany Jim Broadbent Andy SerkisDirector Iain SoftleyDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG for fantasy adventure action some scary moments and brief languageRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Much is made of the magic of literature in Inkheart but the joys of losing yourself in reading are undermined by the movies barrage of special effects and a convoluted plot. Based on Cornelia Funkes popular childrens novel this fantasy adventure saga has appealing moments striking production design and a strong mostly British cast. But too many scenes come across as overly busy and boisterous. Twelve-year-old Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett) and her father Mortimer (Brendan Fraser) have a rare gift of bringing books to life. They are ""silvertongues"" meaning they can conjure printed words into reality simply by reading them aloud. In an early flashback we see Meggies mother Resa (Sienna Guillory) sitting lovingly by her husband and tiny daughter. But by the time Meggie has become an adolescent the family is reduced to devoted father and daughter. At the heart of the story is the mystery surrounding the disappearance of her mother. When Mortimer comes across a copy of a novel called Inkheart Resas story unfolds. But bringing Resa home presents huge and perilous challenges. Andy Serkis plays a snarling villain named Capricorn. Paul Bettany is Dustfinger a mischievous fire juggler who was inadvertently unleashed from his fairy-tale home and is desperate to return. Helen Mirren as Meggies eccentric great-aunt Elinor threatens to steal any scene shes in with a performance that is both arch and loopy. As directed by Iain Softley (The Wings of the Dove) the ensemble cast is one of the films brightest features. Though he doesnt come in until halfway through Jim Broadbent winningly plays Fenoglio the fictional author of Inkheart. When he meets the physical incarnation of the characters he created he cant contain his childlike enthusiasm. The movies biggest asset is the way it celebrates a love of literature. Meggie goes into her aunts imposing library drawn by its many shelves of artfully arranged tomes. When shes admonished not to touch or move anything she begs to read just one book. As she settles in a cozy window seat and digs in any ardent reader will recognize her sense of endless possibility. Its a shame that by its conclusion the movie feels like just another special-effects-driven story. When the film focuses on exploring the limits of the imagination and the joyful surprise of fiction coming to vivid life it is undeniably engaging.

Posted January 23 2009 -- 1200 AM EST Watching Iain Softleys motley jewel-toned adaptation of Inkheart the best-selling 2003 young-adult novel by Cornelia Funke I had the distinct sensation of being a young bookworm again falling into a world as vividly real as it is impossible. In Funkes universe -- given voice in a screenplay by fantasy-friendly playwright David Lindsay-Abaire?a literature lover named Mo (Brendan Fraser) possesses a dangerous talent for bringing characters from books to life when he reads aloud. The downside? When a fictional figure comes alive a real person must disappear into the books pages. That explains the extended absence of Mos wife Resa (Sienna Guillory). Mo has not yet told the truth about Resas disappearance to their intrepid young daughter Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett) just as many a movie adult before him annoyingly withheld information from their children for dramatic effect. (Maybe Frasers Mo a pleasantly square-framed American among a population of Brits just cant bring himself to utter the word ""Mummy."") It also explains the presence of a rambunctious crowd of fictional interlopers. These include a soulful fire juggler (Paul Bettany) who yearns for home (and why not when real-life wife Jennifer Connelly appears briefly as the jugglers fairy-tale missus) and an acquisitive villain named Capricorn (Andy Serkis always welcome even without his Gollum suit). A unicorn and The Wizard of Ozs flying monkeys also make appearances -- as does briefly Toto too. The story is a whirl a jumble an effusion -- sometimes flowing smoothly other times jerking along as if the filmmaker (Backbeat The Wings of the Dove) has been given advice he resents regarding pacing and the balance of sweetness and danger. There are close calls weird whispers amusing throwaway lines the ditherings of a distractible author (Jim Broadbent) and cartoon violence undertaken by misshapen scary-comic evil henchmen. But most deliciously madcap of all there are the grand gestures and imperious pronouncements of Helen Mirren as Meggies flesh-and-blood great-aunt Elinor a creature of pencil-thin eyebrows and luscious costumery who caws and squawks with very unqueenly abandon. Mirrens all-out display in this distinctly British absurdo-literary extravaganza had me wishing Elinor were my own fabulous auntie and that shed lend me some magic items from her closet.

Which is a lot like making a fantasy film itself especially as this and nearly all the others are inspired by best-selling novels and watching them feels like getting ripped out of your own version of a world to be shoved into someone elses. And while silver-tongued Mo (Brendan Fraser) and Iain Softleys childrens flick can take pride in some of the things theyve made we leave convinced that words are better left squat inert and black on the page. Nine years ago Mo read a book called Inkheart to his three-year-old daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett) and British wife (Sienna Guillory) which ripped apart his family and sent him and Meg on the road attempting to dodge both the no-longer-fictional villains and the English accent the girl couldnt avoid even when home schooled across Europe by her Yankee dad. Now twelve Meggie finally learns the truth about her fathers gift when the literary baddies--all of whom have the fantastical touch of having words backwards and forwards scrawled across their faces like cowls from their typeset birth--kidnap them Inkheart author Fenoglio (Jim Broadbent adding humor) and wacky great-aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren adding class) to force Mo to read them passages of wealth and violence. If I was still a bookworm preteen I would like Softleys film fine--though Id likely feel condescended by screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaires additions of Rapunzel Prince Charming and Toto and be restless to climb back inside Cornelia Funkes novel where I could dream up a world just as great for a decimal of the cost.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For the better part of a decade fantasy filmmakers have all been trying to create the next Fellowship Of The Ring. So Inkheart is a welcome throwback--its clearly trying to be the next The Princess Bride. While it mostly lacks the snappy banter that helped make Bride an all-ages classic it has the same overcrowded cast of ringers the same balance of comic lightness and surprising darkness and the same healthy respect for literature and storytelling which translates into a blanket excuse for the storys broad strokes. It doesnt avoid fairy-tale cliches but at least it acknowledges them as tropes. The premise drawn from a dense YA trilogy by ""the German J.K. Rowling"" Cornelia Funke has Brendan Fraser wandering the world in search of a rare novel called Inkheart. When his daughter Eliza Bennett was very young he read to her from Inkheart and several characters emerged from its pages including evil underling Andy Serkis and cowardly self-serving fire-artist Paul Bettany. Meanwhile Frasers wife was sucked into the book. Fraser needs Inkheart to reverse events but Serkis who now commands a castle and his own criminal retinue has been collecting and destroying copies of the book as a safeguard. Bettany meanwhile just wants to go home. Bennett now an adolescent learns about her fathers uncontrolled powers over books for the first time when Serkis and Bettany both come after him launching a crazy-quilt quest full of colorful characters like flaky addled author Jim Broadbent and Frasers cranky rich bibliophile aunt Helen Mirren. Much of Inkheart proceeds with the sprawling CGI-fest polish of an early Harry Potter movie or a Walden Media book adaptation; the direction is as serviceable-but-bland as might be expected from Iain Softley who last helmed The Skeleton Key and K-PAX. But the story itself is so charmingly dense fractious and complicated that it frequently leaves the obvious good-guy-fights-bad-guy groove and noses toward Terry Gilliam-esque randomness and ebullience. It also trades in literary in-jokes and references worthy of Jasper Ffordes Thursday Next novels from winged monkeys to Mirrens exasperated exclamation ""For the love of Thomas Hardy"" Inkheart wont make people forget Princess Bride but it may give them pleasant flashbacks while it rollicks through its own bookish adventures.

Based on the novel by Cornelia Funke the film does at least portray the power of words and books something thats increasingly easy to lose sight of. The power is in fact astounding in Inkheart. Brendan Fraser plays Mo Folchart a ""silvertongue"" meaning that he can read people out of books - bringing for instance Toto from The Wizard of Oz to life. Trouble is for everyone who comes out of a book someone else must go in to replace them. This played out with disastrous results earlier in Mos life. While reading an adventure called Inkheart to his daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett) and wife Resa (Sienna Guillory) he inadvertently reads several characters out of the book including the evil Capricorn (Andy Serkis) and the weak-willed Dustfinger (Paul Bettany) along with assorted henchmen. Things get worse Resa is taken into the book leaving Meggie without a mother - and for several years without an explanation from Mo. They visit Mos crotchety Aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren) a book collector but soon find themselves kidnapped by Capricorn who wants Mo to read more characters out of the book so that he can expand his control. He has been relying on a reader with a stammer which means characters come out not fully formed with words etched across their faces and other problems. Capricorns castle is like a literary quiz. The crocodile who swallowed an alarm clock? Peter Pan. Flying monkeys? The Wizard of Oz. Thats kind of fun. But the logic such as it is doesnt hold. If several characters came out of Inkheart when Mo read it why did only Resa go back in? Dustfinger wants to be read back in but Mo says he cant control who comes and who goes. Its all rather murky and confusing. Mo enlists the aid of Fenoglio (Jim Broadbent) the author of Inkheart hoping he has a copy of the out-of-print book. In the end words are indeed the solution. Seems as if Mo might have figured that out a few years ago but alas he didnt. Happily Resa isnt as timid as he is. Serkis is nicely evil and Bennett makes Meggie a character young girls can cheer for. Fraser is well Fraser and Mirren is Mirren. Shes more satisfying. Inkheart is entertaining enough if not always easy to follow. And if it does nothing else at least it may inspire kids to read if for no other reason than to help make sense of it all.

"Movie review Inkheart -- 2 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Inkheart -- 2 out of 5 stars The cast of Inkheart Warner Bros. The cast of Inkheart The cast of Inkheart (Warner Bros.) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The childrens fantasy Inkheart arrives in theaters as an orphan of Warner Bros. decision to fold up its New Line Cinema division an orphan dumped in the movie wasteland of January.Does this film of Cornelia Funkes novel deserve dismissal? Not really though it is a bit of a humorless slog. In any event one can exult in the Italian Riviera locations and see in a flash why a couple of Oscar winners and Mr. PG-rated Kids Fantasy Brendan Fraser would sign on for the job. Fraser stars as a book-binder who drags his daughter (Eliza Bennett ) through every dingy old bookstore of Europe seeking a novel that swallowed his wife nine years before. Not that he tells daughter Maggie this. But shes smart enough to recall that he hasnt read her a bedtime story ever since Mom disappeared.Dad it seems is a Silvertongue one of those characters described in the novel he seeks (titled Inkheart). In the act of reading a story aloud he brings that storys reality to his own. Thus characters from Inkheart -- the fire-juggler Dustfinger (Paul Bettany) and the villain Capricorn (Andy Serkis) and his henchmen are chasing Dad. And Mom is lost in the book. And yes this is awfully similar to last months Bedtime Stories but never mind. The bad guys catch up and Dad finally confronted by Dustfingers desire to go home enlists wacky book-collecting Aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren) and the actual author of Inkheart (Jim Broadbent) to help foil the villains who want Dad to summon up this great special effect called ""The Shadow."" The heroes use scenes read aloud from The Arabian Nights and The Wizard of Oz (a dandy Italian tornado) to escape Capricorns clutches and the author tries to scribble new scenes to correct the fix that these folks find themselves in thanks to his dazzling prose.""The written word. Its a powerful thing. You have to be careful with it""The Oscar winners (three of them if you count Mrs. Bettany Jennifer Connelly who has a one-scene cameo) enliven things considerably with just a sprinkle of wit. Fraser and Bettany are mostly reduced to advancing the corny and worn action plot blathering pages of exposition during the exceedingly dull middle third of Inkheart. Miss Bennett one of the kids in the far-superior Nanny McPhee doesnt have the charisma to lift this literary-minded enterprise off the printed page and into the realm of movie magic.So while we can appreciate the decent effects the bang-up settings and a good cast we can only hope they got some sight-seeing in on their days off. Whatever magic there was on this shoot is probably in their home movies.

"Inkheart | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; inkheart ) Inkheart (Germany/United Kingdom/United States 2009) January 20 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli With a premise as potentially rewarding as that of Inkheart one can be forgiven for being a little disappointed by the final result. When placed alongside other PG-rated fantasy adventure tales this one struggles to capture the imagination. Part of the problem results from a lack of internal consistency - the movie arbitrarily changes the rules to suit the circumstances. Another element is a failure to generate momentum. Although Inkheart reaches a climax it doesnt build to it and when it happens its more likely to provoke a shrug than an explosion of satisfaction. Inkheart looks good and is well acted but in the end it left me indifferent. The protagonist is young Meggie Folchart (Eliza Hope Bennett) the teenage daughter of Mo Folchart (Brendan Fraser). Together father and daughter scour the used bookstores of Europe searching for a copy of the rare tome Inkheart which is in some way connected with the long-ago disappearance of Meggies mother Resa (Sienna Guillory). It seems that Mo is a ""Silvertongue"" - someone who by reading aloud can make a story come true. However when characters from a book are transported to Earth there must be an exchange with someone from this ""reality"" entering the realm of the novel. At the moment Mos past is emerging to haunt him. Two characters for whose transportation he is responsible - the villainous Capricorn (Andy Serkis) and the homesick Dustfinger (Paul Bettany) - have tracked him down. Capricorn wants Mo to read for him while Dustfinger wants to return to the world within the book. When Meggie and Mo need sanctuary they turn to the mansion of Great Aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren). And when they are unable to procure a copy of Inkheart they seek out the author (Jim Broadbent). Recent years have seen two other examples of books coming to life the dramatic comedy Stranger than Fiction and the modern-day fable Bedtime Stories. Inkheart based on the popular childrens book by Cornelia Funke uses a similar idea to go in a different direction. Here characters and scenes move back and forth between reality and fiction as guided by the readings of someone with a magical ability. As the film progresses the Silvertongues (there are more than one) show an increasingly precise control over their powers so it begs the question of why given the final solution the story couldnt have been wrapped up in a few minutes? The film uses a classic deus ex machina resolution that is fundamentally unsatisfying because it makes the entire adventure that precedes it pointless. Putting aside high-profile tales like The Lord of the Rings The Chronicles of Narnia and Harry Potter live-action fantasy stories aimed at family audiences have not met with much success and theres no reason to believe that Inkheart will fare appreciably better. The movie lacks the necessary hook to excite younger viewers and is not sufficiently sophisticated for older members of the audience. Children will get the most out of it because they will relate more strongly to Meggie and wont be as concerned with the films structural flaws but this isnt the kind of movie theyll be clamoring to see. It is reminiscent of the better crafted City of Ember in terms of intent scope and target audience and will probably generate an equally tepid response. Theres nothing wrong with the acting. In fact in getting capable performers like Paul Bettany Helen Mirren and Jim Broadbent aboard the filmmakers have shown that every attempt was made to ensure a quality cast. Few would peg Brendan Fraser as being on the same talent plateau as the others (two of whom have won Oscars) but he was Funkes choice for Mo and his nice guy persona and penchant for mixing comedy with action serve him well in the role. Fresh face Eliza Bennett (wonder if her mother is a fan of Jane Austen?) leaves the most lasting impression. In her first major screen role shes captivating. Andy Serkis provided with a rare part in which hes not forced to provide motion capture is suitably slimy and evil as is required for a villain in a film like this. There is also a third Oscar winner in the cast although she is uncredited. Bettanys wife Jennifer Connelly has a cameo as Dustfingers bride. Inkheart displays a reverence for books and while it states its case for the well-worn pages of a novel offering a portal into a reality in the mind it struggles a little to give life to that idea. The movie wants to be a sprawling excursion into fantasy and imagination but the screenplay limits it. The incorporation of elements from The Wizard of Oz are nice but one wonders why characters and themes from many other equally well-known and beloved novels couldnt have been included. Its the limitations of the film when considering the nearly limitless possibilities suggested by the premise that make Inkheart a disappointment. As a childrens film its okay but many adults will be less than enchanted.

Mo has abstained from practicing his gift ever since when reading some limited-press-run sub-Terry Brooks fantasy the titular Inkheart his wife was slurped off into limbo just as a motley assortment of the books roughs popped off the page. All of this is retrospectively revealed to Mos daughter when Inkhearts villains catch up with Dad as hes scouring obscure booksellers looking for a copy of The Book so he can reverse the switch. The Capo of the baddies Capricorn (Andy Serkis) doesnt want to go back into bindery and so orders copies of Inkheart put out of print by a private army of book-burning brigands operating from a castle whose dungeon holds a menagerie of literary beasties that include L. Frank Baum flying monkeys and a J.M. Barrie ticking croc. It all smacks of that overdone ""passion for literature"" common in English teachers who send any healthy-minded kid running from books. Bibliophile characters exclaim ""What in the name of Chaucers beard?"" ""For the love of Thomas Hardy"" and ""Great galloping Knut Hamsuns"" (I made just one of those up.) Fraser intones ""The written word Its a powerful thing"" as though sitting for his ""Reading Is FUNdamental"" poster.

Like last years guilty pleasure Enchanted Inkheart plays on the fantastical possibilities of an overlap between fiction and reality homing in on actor Brendan Fraser who yet again essays another of his affable khaki academics. He plays a Silvertongue - no not a stalwart on the regional blue comedy circuit - someone with the ability to bring the written word to life when he reads out aloud. Problems arise when he inadvertently unleashes the megalomaniacal Capricorn (Andy Serkis as an amalgam of Gollum and a camp Bond villain) into the world while simultaneously incarcerating his wife into the pages of the titular novel. Setting off on a Euro-jaunt with his daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett) in order to locate a rare volume of Inkheart and undo his myriad supernatural wrongs he gathers a retinue of variously concerned/ angered conscripts (Helen Mirren Jim Broadbent and Paul Bettany - all enjoyable) whose characters represent the facets of the fiction world from the collector to the author to the endearing fictional side-player whos eventually doomed to death. Its a familiar tale but one told with gusto wit and visual flare; of particular note is the dilapidated Germanic fortress where Capricorn and his cronies reside which looks like it was plucked straight from the warped minds of a Gilliam or a del Toro.

This is the lesson imparted by ""Inkheart."" Books are essential; movies based on books not so much -- this is the lesson imparted by ""Inkheart"" a brisk overstuffed adaptation of Cornelia Funkes international bestseller. Despite abundant talent on both sides of the camera and a bevy of eye-catching supernatural beasties this f/x-heavy story of a literature-loving father and daughter battling dark forces unleashed from the pages of a rare tome doesnt conjure much in the way of bigscreen magic. Delayed nearly a year by New Line the now-Warner Bros. release opens Jan. 23 Stateside following its Dec. 11 bow in Europe where commercial prospects look strongest. Published to great success in 2003 in Germany where the prolific Funke has been likened to J.K. Rowling ""Inkheart"" is the first installment of a fantasy trilogy concerning the adventures of bookbinder Mortimer ""Mo"" Folchart (played in the film by Brendan Fraser) and his 12-year-old daughter Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett) a voracious reader. As revealed in the films prologue Mo is a Silvertongue a person with the rare ability to bring the characters in a book to life simply by reading the text aloud. Meggie initially knows nothing of her dads extraordinary gift. But when a trip to an antique bookshop in Italy leads to a fateful run-in with Dustfinger (Paul Bettany longhaired and unkempt) a self-proclaimed ""fire-juggler"" the truth emerges in flashback Years earlier when Meggie was a wee girl Mo cracked open a novel (titled incidentally ""Inkheart"") and not only brought Dustfinger and other fictional characters out of it but also accidentally banished Meggies mother into it. Mo vowed never to use his gift again (""I dont read aloud anymore"" Fraser says with a straight face) and has since searched tirelessly for his wife seeking a copy of the elusive novel into which she disappeared. Back in the present father and daughter flee to the posh estate of Meggies prim great-aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren carping at everyone in sight). But theres no escaping Dustfinger -- or even worse the megalomaniacal Capricorn (Andy Serkis ghoulish and bald) another refugee who wants to exploit the Silvertongues talent and bring forth more evil into the human world. Thats an awful lot of fantastical mythology for a 105-minute movie and one of the films major flaws is that the characters seem to accept the rules much more quickly than the viewer will. Working from a busy tightly compressed script by playwright David Lindsay-Abaire (his second screenplay after ""Robots"") director Iain Softley seems more interested in ushering his characters from point A to point B (as they dash breathlessly around a scenic Italian Riviera where curiously no one speaks Italian) than in fostering emotional engagement and that all-important sense of wonder. Considering how impressively the helmer molded a much denser piece of literature Henry James ""The Wings of the Dove"" into his elegant and passionate 1997 film adaptation its disappointing that ""Inkheart"" has no feel -- and it seems no time -- for the lingering resonant detail. Not every fantasy film needs to be ""The Lord of the Rings"" but the involvement of New Line and the presence of Serkis Peter Jacksons main muse cant help but drive home the comparison. Cheeky visual references to classic childrens books -- the flying monkeys from ""The Wizard of Oz"" and the ticking croc from ""Peter Pan"" are among the creatures shown here -- keep the pic sporadically engaging and underscore its reverential attitude toward literature. Visually the film is impressively crafted in all respects with lush widescreen views of coastal Italy and splendid palatial interiors by set designer-decorator Niamh Coulter and production designer John Beard. The sole American in a cast of mostly British thesps Fraser doesnt vary his game much essentially reacting to elaborate special effects as he did in ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" and ""The Mummy"" movies. Bennett is spirited and watchable as a girl who must ultimately draw on her own imaginative power to save the day and Jim Broadbent is in reliable fuddy-duddy form as Fenoglio the author of the novel within the novel. If there are any further cinematic adventures of Mo and Meggie the filmmakers will have some serious explaining to do given how tidily ""Inkheart"" dispels the questions and cliffhangers left unresolved at the end of the novel. Its a perfunctory wrap-up to a film that unlike its assorted characters and critters never manages to break free of the page. InkheartProductionA Warner Bros. release of a New Line presentation.
