Giles Keyte/Sony Pictures Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide ""Fury"" written and directed by David Ayer is an impressively solid World War II movie of the kind they dont make anymore. Stylistically and dramatically its a throwback to the war movies of the 1940s and 50s - its even shot on film a rarity these days.Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances as Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier a tank commander with a passion for killing Nazis. His men aboard the ""Fury"" the nickname painted on the gun barrel of their M4 Sherman tank are gunner Boyd (Shia LaBeouf) a thoughtful sort who knows his Bible; loader Grady (Jon Bernthal) a leering hillbilly badly in need of some dental work; and driver Trini (Michael Pena who was so good in Ayers ""End of Watch""). Joining them is Norman (Logan Lerman) a raw recruit trained as a typist who find himself encased in the tank as an assistant driver. Don has to teach this shivering frightened kid how to kill.In the films best scene Don and Norman having secured a German town decamp in an apartment occupied by a mother (Anamaria Marinca) and her teenage daughter (Alicia von Rittberg). The levels of fear and tension and desire in this scene are palpable especially when the three other men from the tank barge in. Its like a scene in a Tarantino movie minus all the smart-aleckiness. Grade B+ (Rated R for strong sequences of war violence some grisly images and language throughout.)

Aside from 1943s Sahara and 1970s Kellys Heroes I have a hard time coming up with any. Maybe its because unlike soaring fighter jets or loaded-for-bear battleships these lumbering beasts of burden arent exactly the flashiest pieces of military hardware. Theyre the grunting workhorses of combat 30-ton steel sardine cans on plodding track wheels that make the cramped confines of a submarine look downright roomy. That stifling sense of claustrophobia hangs over almost every scene in David Ayers new WWII film Fury. Set in April 1945 as the Allies are advancing into Nazi Germany where the soon-to-be-defeated Hitler is digging in his heels and mounting one final desperate push the movie tells the story of a battle-scarred American tank unit. Led by Brad Pitts stoic Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier this band of brothers has been through hell together -- from Africa to France Belgium and now Germany. Their long march is almost over but looking at their grime-caked faces and haunted thousand-yard stares youd never get the impression that theyre on the winning side. As the film opens the unit has just lost a member of its five-man crew and takes on a replacement a terrified and ill-prepared combat virgin (The Perks of Being a Wallflowers Logan Lerman) whos been plucked from the steno pool and sent to the front line. Weve all seen these olive-hued types before the tough-as-nails leader with a hidden streak of compassion (Pitt) the wide-eyed innocent (Lerman) the Southern-fried loudmouth (The Walking Deads Jon Bernthal) the soft-spoken grunt (Michael Pena) and the Scripture-quoting gunner (Shia LaBeouf). The problem is Ayer the writer and director of such existential macho action flicks as Harsh Times and End of Watch isnt interested in giving his characters more than one note to play. Its as if they walked out of an old Sgt. Rock comic. Pitt for instance couldve used a scene like Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan where we learn something -- anything -- about his life back home and what hes fighting for besides the Stars and Stripes. Instead Fury (the title comes from the name of the tank) just plods from one brutal bloody combat scene to the next. And while these orgies of violence are staged with tense gruesome precision (especially the films climactic Wild Bunch-esque last stand) they dont convey much beyond what we already know. Namely that war is hell. Message received.

""No"" Ellison answers timidly. ""You will"" the big guy spits out. Hes not kidding. Fury writer-director David Ayers war film to end all war films (fingers crossed) begins with Wardaddy killing a German cavalry officer with a knife then cutting his eye out as a souvenir. It ends a draining two hours and 10 minutes later in a battle that makes the Alamo look like a pie dessert -- a la mode. This is War Movie 101 all fighting nearly all the time. Ridley Scotts Black Hawk Down pictured a similarly unrelenting siege (Somalia) as did in a fantasy landscape The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers (Rohan). Saving Private Ryan traced an American units trajectory across World War II-era France and Platoon and Full Metal Jacket once that film got past the fatal hazing of basic training submerged the viewer in the Vietnam nightmare as seen by its edgy American invaders. Fury doesnt come close to the achievement of those edifying cinematic ordeals let alone to Samuel Maozs harrowing Israeli film Lebanon which summoned a claustrophobic psychopathy by setting virtually all its action inside an Israeli tank. But Ayers movie has the admirable ambition of showing how even the Greatest Generation could brutalize and be brutalized by war. Brad Pitt youll recall already won World War II in Inglourious Basterds. Hell last year he won World War Z. So how can he and the near victorious GIs of the 2nd Armored Division be established as underdogs in a movie set in Germany in April 1945 just a few weeks before Hitler would blow his brains out in a bunker? Ayers solution put em in a tank where their rumbling weapon was far outclassed by the enemys. Henry Ford produced the Americans thin-skinned Sherman tank; Ferdinand Porsche designed the Germans much larger sturdier Tiger. It was essentially the Tin Lizzie vs. the Mercedes-Benz Super Sport. And though World War II would shortly end the U.S. soldiers couldnt take it easy like college seniors in the final term before graduation. Their mission was to roll through Germany whose Nazi leaders called for every citizen to fight the invaders to their death. To the Americans each person they meet is a potential sniper; every man woman and child is cannon fodder. Some of the soldiers became efficient killing machines. Some of them may have liked it. Norman who looks about 12 and takes most of the movie to grow stubble on his sweet peach face doesnt like killing doesnt want it and when hes drafted as Wardaddys gunner doesnt know how to do it. His first job is to scrape the remains of his predecessor off the insides of the tank nicknamed Fury. He is the token innocent the audience surrogate almost the girl joining a quartet of grizzled veterans. Because their characters are reduced to their religious ethnic or lowlife stereotypes they may as well be called Bible (Shia LaBeouf) Mex (Michael Pena) and Animal (Jon Bernthal). Their tour has taken them to hell and halfway back which makes them the rude tutors in Normans life-or-death indoctrination. ""The wars gotta end soon"" Wardaddy says in one of the boilerplate truisms that serve as this movies dialogue. ""But before it ends a lotta people gotta die."" Sometimes even a little death is a lot. Conquering one village Wardaddy and Norman enter a house that holds two frightened young German women Emma (Alicia von Rittberg) and Irma (Anamaria Marinca star of the Romanian prize winner 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days). Irma makes lunch for Wardaddy who sends Norman off to the bedroom with Emma in what may be their mutual deflowering. The assignation is meant to be tender but the viewer has to wonder if Emma (or for that matter Norman) is a willing participant and if the scene doesnt carry the lingering toxicity of sexual violence. Then the other tank troopers barge in and Animal uncorks a flood of insults that amount to assault. By velvet glove or iron fist barbarism rules. That Ayer would argue is just war daddy. And in staging his big battle sequences he brings Fury to fitful life. The attack of three Shermans on a giant Tiger is choreographed for maximum impact as is the looming face-off between Wardaddys crippled tank and about 300 SS troops marching toward it. Pitt who at 50 still looks great with his shirt off has the gruff charisma to play a dauntless soldier with killer courage and a vestigial streak of humanity. He carries a film that could stumble under the burden of its cliches. You know that when one character whos chomped out bits of Normans callow butt for most of the movie finally makes gentle amends hell be the next to die. And that another character having faced death countless times by German fire or misadventure will survive through an act of enemy kindness. World War II was a historical event but also a movie genre and Fury occasionally prints the legend. The rest of it is plenty grim and grisly. Audience members may feel like prisoners of war forced to watch a training-torture film. The original version of this story misspelled the name of Brad Pitts character. It is Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

By David Denby Logan Lerman Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf man a Sherman tank at the end of the Second World War in David Ayers movie.   Credit Illustration by Rory Kurtz ""Fury"" a fictional account of an American tank crew fighting in Germany in April of 1945 is one of the great war movies--right near the top within range of Steven Spielbergs ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) and other classics. Spielbergs film after its tremendous early sequence devoted to the D-Day landings turns into a platoon movie--a grander version of the pictures made during and after the Second World War in which an ethnically (though not racially) mixed highly individualized group of Americans (Wasp Jew Italian etc.) triumphs over anonymous Fascist helots. ""Fury"" written and directed by David Ayer is a genre movie too five guys in a tank led by Sergeant Don Collier (Brad Pitt) fight desperate battles against the Germans in ravaged fields and along country roads. When the men arent fighting they try to come down from the nauseating exhilaration of combat. They curse pray and bash each other around but the horseplay is no more than a temporary release from the grim wariness they display the rest of the time. The movies prevailing coloring is shrouded browns and grays mixed with clouds of white (smoke from exploding shells) bursts of flame and the glowing flight of shells and tracer bullets. ""Fury"" is literally visceral--a kind of war horror film which is of course what good combat films should be. In just a few weeks the war will be over. The Americans know they will triumph but the Germans fight to defend every last acre of their homeland. The S.S. hangs citizens who wont join the struggle and leaves their bodies dangling from posts along the roadside. An extremely unpleasant irony is built into ""Fury"" the Americans are a winning army but half-terrorized themselves they feel like a losing army. A tank crew faces special nightmares. With its many guns and its crushing weight a tank destroys everything in its path--right up to the point at which enemy tanks or artillery threaten to turn it into a furnace. The four men and Collier (or Top as the crew calls him) fight in a Sherman M4 which is fast and maneuverable but only lightly armored. (It was known in the Army as ""the Ronson lighter""--it lit up easily when hit.) The new German Panzers especially the Tiger II are heavy and slow but protected with thick plate and outfitted with a long-range armor-piercing gun. At the beginning of ""Fury"" Top and his crew drag themselves out of their vehicle; they are the only survivors in a meadow of burned-out Shermans. A few days later in the most nerve-racking battle in the film they try to scuttle around a Tiger to get a shot at its more vulnerable rear. In this and other scenes David Ayer who wrote and directed the excellent cop-buddy movie ""End of Watch"" (2012) maintains the continuity and the coherence of space which make an action movie work emotionally for an audience. Ayer depends on digital special effects but he never deviates from what could be called the illusion of reality--which in this case is almost hallucinatory. Long stretches of the movie will remain in your mind rather than slip into the digital abyss. The air is the air gravity is gravity and when you get hit by something youre in serious trouble. The interior of the Sherman is cramped and hazardous with steel support beams long gear shafts a steering wheel and lots of other obstacles and the men can escape only through tiny hatches. In this mobile prison Ayer working with the cinematographer Roman Vasyanov and the editors Jay Cassidy and Dody Dorn establishes his characters and energizes his actors. As the Sergeant Brad Pitt now fifty squares his shoulders and hardens his voice; he brings the right weight to such portentous lines as ""The dyings not done the killings not done."" This is a different performance from Pitts revelatory work as the father in Terrence Malicks ""Tree of Life"" (2011). That man who considers his life a failure loves his sons blindly with little idea of how to prevent his self-disappointment from spilling into punitive anger. But Top a successful career warrior is always alert. A natural psychologist he draws on the strengths of each crew member to keep them all alive. Like Dana Andrews in this kind of movie seventy years ago hes an ideal leader decisive and stoical but with one difference out of sight kneeling by the side of a tank he falls apart. As the driver Trini (Gordo) Garcia Michael Pena expands his usual persona of a blunt truth-teller and hes never been more likable. Jon Bernthal plays the growling Grady (Coon-Ass) Travis a Neanderthal with big ears and a high-standing brush cut his limbs askew as if God had granted him courage but not coordination. Shia LaBeouf wearing a thick black mustache and spectacles abandons his brash overgrown-boy routine. As the gunner Boyd (Bible) Swan hes a tangle of violence and piety. The mens conversation mixing Biblical incantation and profanity slang and shorthand is not so much spoken as spat out; some of it is close to indecipherable. The crew has its own rhythm in everything it does. We are with them and we are not with them. At first young Norman (Logan Lerman) thinks that he couldnt possibly fit in. A pale and skinny kid trained as a typist hes thrown into battle as the tanks forward machine-gunner. Hes the audiences surrogate--terrified ignorant of combat and nonviolent by nature--and hes the one cliche in the movie the heir to those gentle fellows (Gary Coopers Sergeant York Audie Murphys Audie Murphy) who start off quietly but learn the higher wisdom of war which is that you must kill and kill well or be killed. (Jeremy Daviess Corporal Upham in ""Saving Private Ryan"" doesnt learn the lesson and freezes as his friend gets stabbed by a German soldier.) Ayers message is that war creates courage. Maybe but I could have done without the scene in which Top makes Norman into a man and a soldier by forcing him to shoot a howling German prisoner. Such therapeutic lessons raise more questions (psychological damage? mercy?) than they settle. But Ayer does something original with another typical scene in a conquered town Top and Norman barge into the apartment of two cowering women the fortyish Irma (Anamaria Marinca) and her beautiful young cousin Emma (Alicia von Rittberg). The mens behavior is not chaste but its not abusive either. When the rest of the crew shows up drunk the ambiguities of lust contempt and respect for the defenseless play through a prolonged scene with many odd turns and surprises. The scene is tense in its own way but it provides a gentler emotional tone an altered rhythm in a movie so obsessional and frightening that it makes a ""tough"" Second World War film like ""To Hell and Back"" (1955) look more like ""To Heck and Back."" No one really understands why General Dietrich von Choltitz the German military governor of Occupied Paris did not blow up the city in the summer of 1944. The war in France was in its final phase the Allies were approaching and Hitler wanted to leave nothing behind but rubble. Monuments bridges and museums were wired with explosives yet Choltitz who earlier in the war had followed orders to kill thousands of Russian Jews never lit the fuse. On August 25th he surrendered the German garrison to the Free French leaving the city intact. What stopped him? We know that the Swedish consul-general in Paris Raoul Nordling who had spent most of his life in the city and loved it had several meetings with Choltitz that August during which he negotiated the release of political prisoners. Yet what happens in Volker Schlondorffs ""Diplomacy""--an all-through-the-night confrontation between the two men on the eve of the surrender--is essentially a fiction. Secretly entering Choltitzs quarters at the Hotel Meurice Nordling (Andre Dussollier) charms cajoles exhorts and effectively blackmails the General (Niels Arestrup) into non-action. The scenario is familiar from the 1966 film ""Is Paris Burning?"" with Gert Frobe as Choltitz and Orson Welles as Nordling. The principal suspense in this fascinating movie is generated by the polite and then not so polite ferocity of the arguments between the two men. ""Diplomacy"" was first a play by the French writer Cyril Gely (who did the screen adaptation with Schlondorff) and Arestrup and Dussollier created their roles onstage. Theres little pretense that the movie is much more than a filmed play but the intimate camerawork allows us to see each mans point of view as he watches the other for an opening. The ferocious Arestrup with his intimidating upper lip and his outraged glare makes the General a Prussian aristocrat who is contemptuous of weakness and death. But Choltitz has a quirk which Arestrup plays to the hilt he has an asthma attack every time he has to decide the fate of the city. Dussollier who has one of the great French film voices guttural yet smooth powers through the role of a life-loving man who can be both insinuating and ruthless. By implication the movie presents an argument between civilization and barbarism between the pleasure principle and the death instinct. But the filmmakers mostly avoid high-flown rhetoric in favor of the intensely practical give-and-take of negotiation. Schlondorff dedicating the movie to the late Richard Holbrooke makes a case that diplomacy can solve the most intricately knotted problems.

PHOTOS Brads Us Weekly covers Go ahead and admire the gritty moment -- because in this drama historical authenticity comes at the expense of an absorbing and distinctive story. Leave the theater for an hour to sneak into a screening of Gone Girl and youll miss almost nothing in terms of plot development. The focus here is the Allied Forces who invaded Germany via tanks in during the spring of 1945. (Note This would be just before Hitler surrendered and World War II ended.) Pitts Don Collier nicknamed ""Wardaddy"" is the commander who heads the ""Fury"" machine. He makes it his mission to protect his crewmen (Shia LaBeouf Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal). After an assistant driver is killed an intimidated former clerk (Logan Lerman) joins the fray and must immediately wipe his predecessors pieces of face off the seat. PHOTOS Brangelinas love story Thats just a sampling of the testosterone-fueled history lesson in why war is hell. For two hours the tankers shoot and kill and explode and shoot and kill and explode. (All of the above is set to a bombastic musical score). Theres a mind-numbing and emotionally hollow flow to all it. And this is the kind of film that must live and die on high-intensity action as the dialogue is straight out of War Movie 101. Pitt to Lerman ""Youre no good to me if you cant kill Krauts."" Army sergeant Jason Isaacs to Pitt ""They murdered some good boys out there."" Wait didnt Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn recite this line trying to pick up women in Wedding Crashers? PHOTOS Celebs whove lost or gained weight for roles Our heroes are equally adrift With the exception of Lermans character they all come off as hard-hearted soldiers with a love for the drink and salty insults. We want to emotionally invest in these men part of our Greatest Generation but its impossible to do that because their personalities are so indistinguishable. The collateral damage? A feeling of ambivalence about their respective well beings during the perilous climactic stand-off. (Dont think this detail doesnt matter Just think back on the agonizing pain of watching Tom Hanks et al perish in Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan spoiled us.) PHOTOS Brads hair evolution Still you cant discredit the younger actors for enlisting in this serious throwback-style project. But for Pitt in particular the role is a curious choice given that he already played a Southern-drawled World War II military leader in the far-superior Inglourious Basterds all of five years ago. No doubt writer-director David Ayer (End of Watch) went to painstaking lengths in re-creating details of the period But his ambitious efforts will just leave audiences feeling battle-fatigued.

"Fury | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fury ) Fury (United States/United Kingdom 2014) October 18 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli The first thing I noticed was the mud. Even more than the copious blood and violence it represents the defining visual element of Fury. Its everywhere. Feet are caked with it. Tires and treads churn it under. Roads - if they can be called that - are paved with it. Rarely has a World War II film depicted just how filthy everything was during the 1945 slog across Germanys rural country on the race to Berlin. If writer/director David Ayer is to be credited with nothing else he gets this right illustrating that unlike whats shown in less historically exacting war films the final push for the Allies was no post-D-Day picnic. In a way Fury and 1970s Patton could be considered companion pieces. Both deal extensively with tank warfare but from different perspectives. Patton provides a top-down view of battle - one of the strategist gazing from afar and moving pieces around on a chessboard. For the controversial general engagements were less about Shermans against Tigers than him against Rommel. Fury takes us down to the mud into the heart of the ""purple heart boxes."" This is an intense movie with taut expertly depicted tank battles and a believable sense of camaraderie among the characters. It flouts as many war movie tropes as it embraces and because Ayer doesnt play by all the rules there are times when its unpredictable. In his famous speech to the Third Army Patton said the following ""Some of you boys I know are wondering whether or not youll chicken out under fire. Dont worry about it. I can assure you that you will all do your duty. The Nazis are the enemy. Wade into them. Spill their blood. Shoot them in the belly. When you put your hand into a bunch of goo that a moment before was your best friends face youll know what to do."" This is one of the themes of Fury; it shows how the experience of war can harden a man transforming even the most timid clerk into a killing machine. Fury introduces us the crew of a Sherman M4 tank making its way across Germany in April 1945. Led by their tough-as-nails sergeant ""Wardaddy"" Don Collier (Brad Pitt) they are Bible-thumping Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf) pugnacious Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) and immigrant Gordo Garcia (Michael Pena). The fifth seat in the tank tragically vacated is filled by typist-turned-gunner/driver Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) who is as unenthused about being with the four as they are about having him there. During its quiet moments the movie offers snippets of the sometimes fractious interaction between the tank-mates. There are also five or six engagements (including one in which three Shermans square off against a bigger more advanced German Tiger) and an interlude in a captured town. As good at the battle sequences are (and theyre very good) Furys best moments occur during that interlude. In it Don and Norman find two women hiding in an apartment. They lock the door behind them. At that juncture its unclear how things will proceed. Although Don is a heroic type the film has already shown how wars cold tendrils have changed him. A merciless quality has broken through his personality (illustrated when he shoots a prisoner in the back). Theres uncertainty about how this encounter will resolve and an uncomfortable tension that is could turn ugly. Would Don participate in a rape (or worse)? Without bullets or blood this fifteen minute segment represents a suspenseful pinnacle for Fury as it peels away layers of the characters to expose things about who they are. Then its back into the field. Brad Pitts Don is a toned-down version of the character he played in Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds. Don is just as determined and uncompromising but far less gung-ho. He lives by a code of honor with principle 1 being to keep his men alive. Principle 2 follows Pattons directive about killing Nazis. In particular he has no sympathy for the SS. The only good one is a dead one and it doesnt matter if he has surrendered. Pitt is believable in this role; the actor vanishes into the character. Logan Lerman doesnt have Pitts screen presence but he fills the role of the clerk-turned-warrior capably. His character has the longest and most extreme arc. Shia LaBeouf who may or may not have retired from acting after this performance fulfills the promise that once had Hollywood insiders predicting great things from him. Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal fill out the quintet. Ayer (the writer of Training Day and the writer/director of End of Watch) does almost everything right in Fury. He captures the grotesque side of war without completely removing the heroic element. This isnt two hours of the Saving Private Ryan Normandy Beach sequence but it has a similar sensibility the meaning of war to those on the front lines and in the trenches is ""survival."" Its kill or be killed. Looking for something more lofty than another day of life is left to the generals strategists and politicians. The tank battles are presented with as strong a sense of verisimilitude as there has ever been in a World War II film (with only a limited reliance on special effects). Fury offers sufficient down time to develop the characters but not so much that it causes the pace to become sluggish. Is this an Oscar contender? Its hard to say considering the Academys sometimes bizarre choices. This is a memorable motion picture accurately depicting the horrors of war without reveling in the depravity of man (like Platoon). Equally it shows instances of humanity without resorting to the rah-rah sanitized perspective that infiltrated many war films of the 1950s and 1960s. Its as good a World War II film as Ive seen in recent years and contains perhaps the most draining battlefield sequences since Saving Private Ryan.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Oct 17 2014 Culture The opening shot of Fury the brutal saga of an American tank crew in Germany near the close of World War II is of a Nazi officer on horseback guiding his mount amid the lifeless hulks of half a dozen burning tanks. Its an ironic reversal--the past standing victorious over the present--but one that will prove to be short-lived. (We do after all know how the war turned out for Nazis and combat horses alike.) One of the tanks is not so lifeless as it appears and its commander leaps from the turret unhorsing the officer and stabbing him to death.That commander is Staff Sergeant Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt). Over the course of a quick bout of battlefield tank maintenance we meet the rest of his crew the soulful Christian gunner Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf); the thuggish hillbilly mechanic Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal); and the Mexican-American driver Trini Garcia (Michael Pena) who lies somewhere on the middle of the crews broad moral spectrum. When their Sherman tank returns to its operating base they all meet the newest member of their crew Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) an impossibly innocent young recruit who was pulled from a clerical post to become the tanks assistant driver. His first assignment is to mop up the blood and flesh of the man whose seat he has just inherited.Related Story Fall Movie Preview 21 Buzzy Awards-Season Contenders Written and directed by David Ayer (End of Watch) Fury offers a stark and unforgiving portrait of the closing days of the Good War in the European theater. Shot in hues of gray and brown it presents a universe of steel and smoke and--most of all--mud swimming with corpses littered with dead trees and endlessly crisscrossed by tank tracks. The performances are strong and in technical terms the film is above reproach This is almost certainly the most persuasive depiction of tank warfare yet committed to celluloid. Over the course of its first half-hour Fury conveys with visceral intensity the experience of huddling alone with four other men in a tiny vulnerable metal shell while Hell breaks loose all around you. The problem with the film is that over its subsequent hour and a half it does little more than repeatedly convey that same experience albeit at escalating levels of mayhem.The plot is at once linear and episodic. Following the introductory scenes Wardaddy and his crew are given a mission by their captain (Jason Isaacs) ""I want you to rescue my guys and take the guns out."" Following the successful completion of this task the men are given a brief period of R amp; R in a captured German town. This intermission features an awkward morality play in the apartment of two German lasses one that serves principally to confirm the First Law of Hollywood Beautiful people (Pitt Lerman German actress Alicia von Rittberg) are inherently good and ugly people (the leering slobbering Bernthal) are inherently not. Then its back to the senseless yet disappointingly generic horrors of war ""The old man wants you"" Wardaddy is informed. ""Hes got a mission.""Over the final act grim begets grimmer. Wardaddy and his men are hopelessly outgunned by an enemy Tiger I tank of almost unfathomable impregnability. (A historian and former Army tanker who sat next to me during the screening explained that de facto U.S. policy during the war was that a Tiger could beat eight Shermans but not ten--so we simply had to build ten of ours for every one of theirs.) The crew encounters an unfortunately placed landmine and later a still more unfortunately placed SS battalion.For fans of military valor and action sequences Fury offers plenty of both. But as a narrative endeavor it too becomes an increasingly muddy slog riddled with cliches and derivative scenes. A callow boyish lieutenant--too young even to shave--is introduced in the first reel only to die quickly so that his war-hardened sergeant can assume command. Lermans character will have an opportunity to prove that he is truly sensitive by playing the piano and Pitts will have an opportunity to prove that he is truly Brad Pitt by taking his shirt off. We will be treated to scenes of men perforated with bullets men hurled skyward by cannon fire men with their heads blown off men combusting like campfires men crushed under tank treads and--notably--a man already crushed under tank treads whom we watch get further crushed under further tank treads.Over the final act grim begets grimmer.What is perhaps most surprising about Fury is the extent to which its final act recalls both prior cinema (in particular Saving Private Ryan) and the real-life exploits of World War II hero Audie Murphy who fought off German troops single-handedly by mounting a flaming tank and using its .50 caliber machine gun. In the former case the disappointment--an almost overwhelming sense of been-there-done-that--is straightforward. In the latter its slightly more complicated. Murphy after all was rewarded for his heroism by attaining movie stardom including a role in one film To Hell and Back in which he played himself. He thus served as an immediate model for Fredrick Zoller the German war-hero-turned-star of Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds--a movie that also featured Brad Pitt as an American commander behind Nazi lines. Is this an ironic play on Tarantinos already irony-besotted epic? Perhaps. But if so Ayers gives little hint of it in his resolutely stoic straightforward war film.All of which is what makes Fury so frustrating. It is too technically refined to be a truly bad movie but too narratively and thematically stunted to be a good one. In a sense it succeeds too well in conjuring its own subject matter heavy mechanical claustrophobic and unrelenting. If you would like to be reminded for two-plus hours exactly why you should be grateful not to be a soldier in a U.S. tank in the closing months of World War II then you should by all means see the film. For those readers less committed to this ultimately unsurprising thesis feel free to take my word for it.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

It is a difficult film to discount. From the vivid fluid photography (Roman Vasyanov) to the mournful and muscular score (Steven Price) ""Fury"" is irrefutably crafted. Over two hours long it is tense going a sturdily acted affair. And yet.... As the author of this drama Ayer has penned a work that takes us no place new or illuminating. For any war film reaching the multiplex when the nation resides in what feels like a perpetual state of military engagement this is an artistic breach. Pitt portrays Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier. The movies title nods to the name Collier and his men have christened the Sherman tank. Everywhere they have fought -- from North Africa to Normandy -- Fury has been outmatched by German Panzers and anti-tank weaponry. Yet they have survived the slaughter. When we meet them they have finally lost a man and it has plunged each of them into a personal if laconic hell. Into that maelstrom comes Norman Ellison a fresh-faced typist thrown into the fray as the tanks second driver. Michael Pena (who co-starred in Ayers 2012s cop drama ""End of Watch"" portrays the able driver Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia. They are a varied bonded bunch. Which doesnt mean there arent prickly tensions. Shia LaBeouf portrays Boyd ""Bible"" Swan the Christian conscience of the crew. His opposite is embodied by Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (Jon Bernthal) a strong short-fused brute of a man. If that sounds a bit like casting for archetypes it feels that way. Looking like a young Christian Slater Norman arrives with a moral code that Collier and his tanker crew begin to chip away at. For good reason survival. The military especially during a draft can have an in loco parentis role in relation to its young fighting men. Collier takes his moniker seriously. He is a war daddy bringing up an unprepared baby. Nowhere is this point made more obvious than a scene in which Collier and Norman enter an apartment where two German women -- an aunt and her niece -- are hiding. The sergeant makes himself at home and insists Norman do the same. This is part of a remarkable scene that exploits and maintains a miserable tension one built atop the possibility of sexual violence. (You know the spoils of war.) Its chilling and well directed. Only in the end Ayer seems to dodge a bullet. Pitt has held a WWII leadership position before. In Quentin Tarantinos Holocaust revenge film ""Inglourious Basterds"" he portrayed Lt. Aldo Raine leader of an elite team of Nazi hunters. Their twang sounds similar. Only the order of things here flips Marxs saying about history repeating. In ""Basterds"" history was depicted as bleak dark farce. This time its bloody tragedy -- bleaker and darker. Forget carving a swastika into the forehead of the enemy Collier plants a knife deep in a tanker soldiers head then does it again and again. ""Fury"" begins with an act of carnage and one of mercy. The gesture of kindness will take on a sadder meaning when two of Wardaddys men recount a horror that took place when they first landed in Europe. The 46-year-old Ayer whose other films include ""Training Day"" (as writer) and ""End of Watch"" wanted to bring some of the murk and misery of todays conflicts to the Greatest Generations history-blessed war. For so many decades the soldiers of that war were decidedly tight-lipped about their battlefield experiences. More than Steven Spielberg with ""Saving Private Ryan"" Ayer fills in those silences with the horrors that made his elders so mute to begin with. Norman learns that war is if not hell at least a place in which all bets are off. It is an aberration (sometimes necessary) in which situational ethics becomes the rule. In which a combat newbie resists the lessons of his commander and tank mates only to give in to a raw rage -- born of a thousand ugly moments that cry out for killing. If you hope for the movie theaters version of an armchair wisdom that may help you grasp the conflicting emotions of soldiers youre not likely to find it in this well-made drama. If thats truly what you hanker for consider Sebastian Jungers documentary ""Korengal."" Granted its not a Saturday-night-out sort of thing. But then maybe were getting to that moment in our nations maturity when ""Fury"" shouldnt be either.

"Signifying Nothing? When the Man Behind Training Day and End of Watch Tackles WWII << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Signifying Nothing? When the Man Behind Training Day and End of Watch Tackles WWII Movies October 17 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print As long as someones head is being blown off Fury isnt bad. The technique on display is about what youd expect for a World War II movie that reserves its most reverent imagery for the mechanical majesty of tanks. But at some point youre able to pull yourself together to notice that when gunfire strikes a procession of armored vehicles and a soldier flies from a turret he does so the way Gonzo might in a Muppet movie. You notice that its not rockets speeding into armored vehicles but lasers. Yes the tanks look like theyre shooting lasers. Its apparently an accurate rendition of how period tracer rounds worked but still green for the Germans molten pink for the U.S. Its a small smartish detail that makes it easier to keep track of which side is firing upon what. It also reconstitutes the shooting as something fit for Atari. The films deliberateness made me queasy. It flirts with celebration -- not of war but of a directors proving he can re-create it searingly graphically. I saw the ads for this movie and noticed that its writer and director was David Ayer and I thought Great. Because what the Second World War needs is the writer of Training Day and the director of Harsh Times and Sabotage. Ayer is still putting a premium on masculine bravado and his usual grisly chaos. The cameras in this springs Sabotage slid around in gore. Here the movies war virgin and audience surrogate -- a young bright-eyed typist named Norman (Logan Lerman) -- removes half a face from a bloody tank interior. But theres an ambitious steadiness to what Ayer has done in Fury. You might say hes applying himself. Its a self-conscious application though war for filmmakings sake. Fury drags us back to 1945 Germany with a tale of Ayers own creation. As the war is winding down a band of 2nd Armored Division soldiers conducts rescue and support missions free American soldiers holed up in a small town stop a supply train from being overtaken. The title is derived from a Sherman M4A2E8 tank. The letters ""F-U-R-Y"" have been painted in white on the cannon. Its got an almost prehistoric grandeur. And -- under the hyperconsciously masculinized circumstances -- in that looming tank gun its also got a big dick. Certainly Ayer is showing us the war from a new angle. Ive never spent this much time in a Sherman. Theres a high that comes from watching the soldiers -- and for that matter the filmmakers -- harmonize to bring the tank alive the use of the periscope the swiveling of the gun seat the cranking adjustment and loading of the giant gun. The movie appreciates the labor required for its danger. The men who operate the tank are types each with a character-defining war handle. ""Bible"" (Shia LaBeouf) quotes Scripture and wears a mustache. ""Gordo"" (Michael Pena) speaks Spanglish and sports a thick chain atop his uniform. And its presumable that with his drawl and graying teeth ""Coon-Ass"" (Jon Bernthal) isnt from Greenwich. The officer in charge (Brad Pitt) is a terse sergeant with pomaded hair. In the opening tracking shot a soldier rides a white horse through the smoking ruins of a battlefield. The foreboding tranquillity of the image dies the instant the horse passes the Fury and a man climbs off the tank and stabs the soldier until hes dead. Thats Pitts character ""Wardaddy."" Most people in the movie call him Don and his carriage commands respect. Most of the time the men have a louche camaraderie that transforms the tanks close quarters into a dorm room. Theyre such types that theyre almost self-conscious about it the way cops in Ayers other films perform a kind of copness. Norman is the new guy. The face he scrapes up belongs to the previous fellow. Bible and Coon-Ass and Gordo they miss their old comrade and arent too crazy about Norman and his open pacifism. As the guy in the machine gunners seat he has to learn to shoot. Sergeant Don has to be the tough-love parent -- the Wardaddy -- who puts a pistol in Normans hand holds him down and makes him kill a German soldier. Were supposed to find harrowing the momentary thrill Norman receives from peering through the gun hatch and mowing men down. But moralism isnt Ayers strong suit. Hes trying for the grit and grandeur and surprise of latter-day American war films -- Apocalypse Now The Big Red One Platoon Saving Private Ryan Inglourious Basterds. A vanquished German town provides the setting for an extended interlude in which Don takes Norman into an apartment still occupied by a mother and daughter (beautifully acted by Anamaria Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg). As American soldiers drink and loot and party in the square outside the building Don tries to steal for himself some civility a shave a meal maybe the touch of a woman. Don forces Norman to head into a bedroom with the daughter who somehow manages to shed her reluctance. This sequence is almost the only reason to have Pitt in this movie. He barely seems to talk (Don does speak German) but the authority of his presence dominates the apartment. The other three characters take their orders from Dons silence his eyes. This is a passage that could have transformed the film -- darkened it opened it outward. But once the other men of the Fury intrude -- drunk belligerent jealous that Don brought Norman upstairs for sex and not one of them -- Ayers script doesnt know where to go with this disrupted oasis so he obliterates it. That sequence is confusing. The arriving men menace the frightened women and tell a sloshed bitter story thats meant to get at the wars horror. But the moment doesnt explicate the soul of the movie as does the digressive rubber plantation dinner sequence Francis Ford Coppola added to Apocalypse Now or provide comedy and then unbearable suspense as the beer hall sequence does in Inglourious Basterds. Maybe Ayer thinks it does but hes straining for meaningfulness. Its a digression that challenges Dons authority in the wrong way. Does he have control of these guys or not? Its as if the only reason he picked the newbie to come upstairs is that the younger mans name is ""Norm."" No one else really gets to do much. That is except the movie effects team. Thats a shame since LaBeouf Bernthal and Pena have clearly worked out backstories for these guys. LaBeoufs mustache appears to perform his monologues for him. And Lerman isnt bad. But the audience doesnt need to identify with an innocent. Give him something to act.  The overarching moral structure of World War II has lent itself to ready-made Hollywood heroism since before it even ended. The U.S. was good the Nazis bad. American movies keep going back to that war because its the one that most cleanly showcases valor. The moral lines -- with regard to Germany -- are navigably straight enough to make the modern declinists sound blasphemous. Even when American soldiers die in these movies history reassures us that they win. No matter how complex or prone to quagmire our other military engagements well always have this part of WWII to romanticize. And well always have the Germans whose eternal damnation for Nazism and the Holocaust is the Hollywood war picture. Fury leans on the fantasy of Nazi expendability the way Pac-Man relies on pellets and levitating fruit game over without them. The American outfit in Inglourious Basterds includes Jews who take out the Third Reich in an infernal bloodbath. Quentin Tarantinos revisionism was distasteful but at least he took a risk in his attempt to revise. You dont know what more Ayer is after with Fury other than say staging one tank fight that looks like a dance between two geriatric dinosaurs. Its an excitingly done encounter that indicates how grueling battle between two armored beasts must have been 70 years ago. But even just between an American Sherman and what the Americans know to be a more advanced German Tiger its like pointed macho commentary on remote-control warfare. Drones? What a joke. Even with Hitler on the ropes as he was the German forces dont relent. Here they are the killers of women children and Jews and Ayer treats them like invading zombies whose determination not to lose is as strong as the Allies determination to win. A fatalism unites all of Ayers movies even his best film End of Watch. He makes police movies about how moral and spiritual corruption function in broad daylight. The move to war seemed inevitable. This is the first of his movies in which that fatalism culminates in a state of grace Ive never experienced in a war film before. At some point a peace comes over you knowing a kind of death is the only outcome in any combat scenario. This is different from the artistic transcendence a magnum opus by Jean Renoir or Andrei Tarkovsky makes you feel. Ayer achieves about 140 seconds of grimly sublime convergence in which the men and the Fury become one. It was a relief to let go of anxiety fear and dread I didnt realize I was sharing with these men as thinly drawn as they are. A director with the power and skill to do that might consider applying those attributes to the conflicts of these harsh times.

Giles Keyte/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Giles Keyte/Columbia Pictures Brad Pitt plays Wardaddy an Army sergeant leading a mission in Nazi Germany. Giles Keyte/Columbia Pictures Fury David Ayers brutal reflective wholly absorbing World War II movie is about tank-to-tank combat and the way war degrades everyone it touches but for about a minute it looks like a Western. A rider on a white horse crosses a misty field in no great hurry gradually filling the frame. Ayers patient camera tracks him into a metal thicket of burning American Shermans and their superior German counterparts Tigers. Then Brad Pitt tackles the rider whose Nazi uniform has come into focus and drives his knife through the officers eye and into his brain. (He spares the horse.) Its April 1945 the last exhausted gasp of ""Good War"" in Europe; in a few weeks Hitler will kill himself in a bunker and the Thousand-Year Reich will surrender in Year 13. But Fury reminds us like no film since Saving Private Ryan 16 years ago that there was nothing good about it and it does so with considerably less flag-waving. And as with Saving Private Ryan a few clumsy steps in the late going -- specifically a final act fueled by the sort of fantasy machismo that the film has until that point avoided -- do nothing to blunt the impact of Furys superb first 90 minutes. Though it was shot mostly in Oxfordshire and Hertfordshire England this is the odd military picture wherein (save for Jason Isaacs doing his best Moe Szyslak impression) the American soldiers are actually played by Americans. We follow the crew of Fury a Sherman tank thats been in the war since Africa 1942. Everyone in its five-man crew has a ""war name"" the born-again Shia LaBeouf is ""Bible"" the alcoholic Michael Pena is ""Gordo"" and so on. As the commander Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier Pitt has the same not-quite-standard-issue haircut he sported as the Nazi-huntin Army lieutenant in Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds five years ago. Though he gets to snack on lines like ""this is a merican tank; we talk merican"" and scold his men to ""knock off the horseplay"" theres none of that Tarantino impishness in his performance here. Wardaddy is an exhausted righteous killer doing penance for untold sins. Pitt wears the role as John Wayne wouldve occasionally generous but often aloof. When he needs to mourn hes careful to do it out of the sight of his men. Taking in the rich performances of the strong supporting cast -- Pena as the half-drunk tank driver Logan Lerman as the green clerk-typist Norman Ellison Jon Bernthal as Grady a brute who probably never had a toothbrush until the Army issued him one -- it becomes casually apparent what a generous star Pitt has grown into leaving air in the room for others else to breathe. Even LaBeouf is convincing. In Ayers steady hands war-film cliches play more like the obligatory notes in a classical tragedy. One example Norman (that clerk-typist) has been ordered to the front to replace the slain gunner of Fury Wardaddys M4. (Some of the tanks in the unit are named Matador Lucy Sue Old Phyllis and Murder Inc.) Sensitive and educated he thinks Gordo must be insane when the driver tells him to spray a pile of probably already-dead Germans with machine-gun fire. Because he hesitated Wardaddy wrestles him to the ground and forces him to execute a captured German soldier who is holding up photos of his family and pleading for his life. Rough stuff. Ayer a master of sweaty atmosphere makes us imagine what the inside of this Sherman must smell like; five unwashed guys locked in a can together for three years their boredom sporadically punctuated by rage or terror. Hes best known for his grim policiers Training Day and End of Watch. Most recently he made Sabotage a gnarly disreputable thriller about crooked DEA agents. Fury is a big step up in sophistication. Where it elevates itself from being merely a believably grimy well-acted war drama is in its long and surprising middle act. Liberating a town where the S.S. has been hanging German civilians who refuse their Fuhrers order that ""every man woman and child"" fight the Allied invaders the Americans sort out the S.S. soldiers to be executed and almost as quickly decide theyre entitled to the towns women plying them with chocolate and nylons and cigarettes. It matters little if the ladies arent explicitly saying no since theyre likely terrified maybe starving and surrounded by strange men with guns. Ayer considers the sexual politics of life during wartime in a long sequence wherein Wardaddy and Norman invite themselves into the home of a German woman and her pretty young relative played by Anamaria Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg. Wardaddy offers them a gift -- a half-dozen fresh eggs (where did he find them?) -- and takes advantage of the rare opportunity to bathe. The younger of the pair is charmed when Norman sits down at their piano and begins to play but any pleasure she takes in the music is only in the context of the fact that a bit earlier the older one was hiding her under the bed to protect her. It becomes clear that were witnessing sexual assault taking place effectively if not literally at gunpoint The women have only the options of these two who can sit at a table and be civil for a few precious hours or their rougher more profane brothers who eventually shove their way in. When Wardaddy lays down orders ruling out the kinds of mistreatment from which he chooses to protect these women Grady vents his rage taking the girls plate from her and licking her food. Rather than rebuke his subordinate for his repellent conduct Wardaddy simply trades plates with the girl taking the contaminated dish for himself. He has made these men into savages. Now he and we and the women in the house must live with it.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 17 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 17 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by David Ayer Written by David Ayer Starring Brad Pitt Shia LaBeouf Logan Lerman Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal Classification 14A Country USA Language English When Brad Pitt as Sergeant Don (Wardaddy) Collier tells his raw kill-shy new tank gunner Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) that ""ideals are peaceful. History is violent"" the words land with the crushing authority of a round of earth-rattling mortar fire. That theyre spoken by a guy with a face like burnished Naugahyde eyes glazed icy blue by the horror theyve seen and enough scars on his back to resemble a street map of Mexico City only adds to their aura of gravitas. That theyre spoken in a movie that has about as much to do with real history as your popcorn does with daily nutritional requirements is a point best left for spoilsports and yes historians. Fury is a war movie with balls of steel and marbles for brains. Its April 1945. Hitlers army is in a state of desperate retreat. Its scorching all earth in face of the Allied advance across the Fatherland and consists - in this movie anyway - of forcibly recruited children (boys and girls) terrified by the ruthless lycanthropes of the SS. Those who refuse to comply are strung up on lampposts and left for display their villages reduced to smouldering rubble.Its apocalypse right here and now and while unpleasant for the citizens in harms way an excellent arena for the playing out of writer-director David (Training Day Sabotage) Ayers blood-and-guts fantasy of macho purification through carnage and glorious self-sacrifice. Into those killing fields rides the Sherman tank named Fury (written with needless phallic suggestiveness on the length of its big gun) packed not only with Wardaddys selectively represented all-American kids - Shia LaBeoufs scripture-quoting ""Bible"" Swan Michael Penas token non-white Garcia Jon Bernthals peckerwood good ole boy ""Coon-Ass"" Travis and Lermans ripe-for-blooding typing-pool transfer Ellison - but enough pure war-movie corn to feed an army of make-believe Hollywood GI Joes.While this falls as thick and densely as the heavy metal ordnance ejaculated so furiously from the tanks heavy metal spout the movies core dramatic cliche is also its hands-down hoariest The grizzled seen-it-all Zen-like vet - the war daddy - who initiates the wide-eyed child into the necessary testicular rite of drawing blood and whose own rueful practicality concerning the matters of life and death (but mostly the latter) are a simplistic war movies most reliable cover for the real agenda of rendering the hell of war as the best damn man-making machine this side of a pro football field.Born in 1968 and therefore of a prime generational cohort to be susceptible to the romantic allure of the Second World War as the last clearly defined morally unambiguous and politically consensual conflict fought by the United States - and more likely steeped in Sylvester Stallone Rambo revisionism and Saving Private Ryan retro-romanticism than the grand tradition of anti-war movies - Ayer is drawn to the fields of nearly defeated Germany for obvious reasons The enemy can remain facelessly evil and unambiguously eligible for slaughter imminent victory looms as a justification for killing anything and everything that moves in any way possible and one can happily avoid the sticky situational moral and political complexities that have so inconveniently marred just about every American military conflict since. Yes Wardaddy history might indeed be violent but Fury aint history far from it. Its pop myth and Germany circa April 1945 serves that nicely. Where else would you get away with naive romanticism?Inevitably given its steel-plated thinking Fury heads toward a gesture of ultimate coming-to-glory and self-sacrifice as the wounded tank is repurposed on a muddy German country road into a canned variation of the Alamo and the logic of transcendent masculine rebirth in blood is played out as one of the Old Wests most venerated myths in which a group of brave men fight ceaselessly oncoming waves of inhuman attackers to the death. Its a stirring and well-mounted sequence to be sure as is much of Fury when its indulging in the clearly relished business of making fake war. (The movies finest and easily most harrowing moment is a close-quarter tank battle on an open field.) But its as caked in thick layers of pure war-loving b.s. as it is mud and blood as loving a tribute to the cleansing baptism of righteous killing as only someone whos confused movies with history could possibly create.Imminent among Ayers forthcoming projects is a remake of Sam Peckinpahs The Wild Bunch which as horrifying as the prospect might be for admirers of the original film sort of makes sense That movie is the ultimate western genre expression of the bloody rite of male self-sacrifice and an irresistible spectacle for somebody who loves to play with toy guns.

It begins smashingly though with turns you rarely see in stories of ""the Greatest Generation."" The scarred leather-faced tank commander Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (an aggressively deglamorized Brad Pitt) butchers a solitary German officer rather than take him prisoner. A short time later he not only decides to shoot an SS man who surrenders to him but he forces -- in an excruciatingly prolonged scene -- a jittery clerk-typist Private Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) to pull the trigger. ""Dont make me do this"" weeps Ellison as Collier slaps him and wrestles him into position to fire a bullet into the head of a man who has pulled out photos of his wife and children and is begging for his life. And then --A blam Ive never been to war but Ive read enough personal reminiscences to know that what haunts many vets -- sometimes as much as watching other soldiers die -- is the murders they committed or witnessed. Its important to hear about those actions not necessarily because these men should be held to account. Its because killing people -- either prisoners or civilians -- is the one thing theyre not allowed to talk about when they come back. Theres no outlet for it; its the great unmentionable. And on the evidence it eats at them for the rest of their lives. Watching a heroic star like Pitt play an American World War II commander who kills (and does other unsavory things) without conscience were forced to acknowledge the real meaning of ""war is hell."" Its not just what the bad guys do. Its what the good guys do too. (Yes I know Pitt killed Nazis with relish in Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds but that was WWII camp. Fury means to be ultrarealistic.) Ayer has a grip on all his slippery issues. Theres a nightmarish absurdity about this final horrendous burst of fighting. Its spring of 1945 when Nazi defeat is all but certain and yet Hitler has called for ""total war."" Collier and his men roll into an Allied camp inside Germany with the corpse of their beloved gunner still in the tank in pieces. Private Ellison whos supposed to take the dead mans spot has to clean up whats left of him which includes part of a face. ""They murdered some good boys out there today"" Colliers superior tells him. The tank commander listens outward feeling burned away but clearly agonized inside. Rolling past German civilians hung by Nazis he utters one of his many suitable-for-framing lines ""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent."" Collier accepts his own formulation with alacrity. He intends to kill every German he sees. On the end of his tanks gun the word ""Fury""A is scrawled. The others in his crew consist of Shia LaBeouf as a religious soldier who sees Gods will in everything (""His number came up thats all"") Michael Pena as a smartass and Jon Bernthal as the roughest-looking. Theyre not such nice guys. They bully Lermans Ellison. They applaud whatever Collier does even when its technically a war crime. But as they fight you come to accept them love them. Its part of Furys creeping relativism. Ayer serves up the ultimate test of our sympathies in the long strange centerpiece in which Collier and young Ellison make themselves at home in the flat of two German women (Anamaria Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg). The air is heavy with the threat of sexual violation; the women are virtual slaves to Colliers whims. When Pena and Bernthal show up the atmosphere becomes even more fraught -- you wonder if these women will survive the encounter with Our Boys. The sappy romantic note on which the scene ends is nearly unforgivable. The violation is that theres no violation. Americans are sweeties at heart. Fury doesnt lose its hold on you though. Some of the images are so hideous that they have the quality of myth such as the corpse the tank rolls over that is so flattened it has merged with the mud. Pitt -- though he doesnt disappear into his part hes obviously putting on his drawl -- has an impressive stillness. He knows hes playing both a man and a symbol and he lets Ayers camera take his measure. Pena Bernthal and even LaBeouf (""even"" because the actors sanity has lately been questioned) are fine and while Lerman overdoes his characters lip-licking naivete the writing isnt exactly nuanced. Ellison is the movies moral pivot and the character who suffers most when Ayer returns to formula with a vengeance. Fury comes down to whether the fresh-faced horror-stricken clerk-typist can prove his manhood by rocking out behind a big gun as he sprays Germans with bullets. The revulsion that Steven Spielberg maintained to the end of Saving Private Ryan is nowhere in sight--Ayer betrays his own values with a climax thats like a hack gamers recreation of Peckinpahs The Wild Bunch. The final encounter between Ellison and a German soldier is meant to offer humanist balance but in context its ludicrous. You cant believe Ayer thought he could get away with it. Though much of Fury crumbles in the mind the power of its best moments lingers the writhing of Ellison as hes forced to kill; the frightening vibe of the scene with German women; the meanness on some soldiers faces and soul-sickness on others. Our knowledge that German surrender is imminent gives the film an aura of tragic senselessness This doesnt need to happen. But Ayer knows that much of his audience consists of jocks eager to see Nazis royally wasted and he gives them what they want. He represents the best and worst of American filmmaking ""Ideals are peaceful. Ditching them selectively wins the battle of the box office.""

(Photo Sony Pictures Entertainment)Graphic grim and fairly relentless ""Fury"" is one of those war-is-hell movies that revel a bit too much in the evil men do.Writer-director David Ayer (""End of Watch"" ""Harsh Times"" he wrote ""Training Day"") loves to get down to the ugly nitty-gritty in films and here he absolutely rolls in the dirt. Bodies are crushed heads blown off everybody sports a constant layer of grime and ideals dont stand a chance.Its April 1945 and a battle-maddened sergeant named Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) commands a close-knit Sherman tank crew as it works its way through Germany. Into the volatile mix of a Hispanic driver (Michael Pena) a Christian gunner (Shia LaBeouf) and a backwoods mechanic (Jon Bernthal) comes a new recruit named Norman (Logan Lerman) a fresh-faced kid who thought he was being sent to Germany to type.No such luck. Norman is soon introduced to the horrors of war and under Wardaddys tutelage he transforms from nice scared boy to Nazi-killing machine bonding with his brothers in the tank even as hes appalled by their monstrous tendencies.There isnt all that much plot here mostly grisly battle scenes tempered with a tense afternoon of respite in a fallen town leading to the inevitable and somewhat cliched final slaughter scene. Ayer is tracking the fall of innocence and the wretched intimacy of war sure but hes also exulting in machine guns mowing down bodies upon bodies.In the end the films macho swagger leaves little room for subtlety or character although all the actors involved do fine work. ""Fury"" is a brutal film that too easily celebrates rage and bloodshed to no clear end beyond ugly spectacle.TLongdetroitnews.comFuryGRADE C+Rated R for strong sequences of war violence some grisly images and language throughoutRunning time 134 minutes 16 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1wa6tb0 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2014/10/17/fury-review-brad-pitt/17379825/,200,fury(2014)15,fury(2014),detroitnews

Wardaddy Brad Pitt leads a small squad into Germany during the final days of World War II. But their brutal and criminal acts make them less than heroes.       Photo Giles Keyte MOVIE REVIEW ""Fury"" Band of brutes. Running time 134 minutes. Rated R (profanity graphic violence). At the Lincoln Square the Magic Johnson the Union Square and others. By the end of ""Fury"" I was rooting for Brad Pitt to get shot between the incisors. This is a problem because hes the hero of the film -- a hard-charging sergeant who eats lead and craps shrapnel. Yet hes a vainglorious bastard -- vindictive stupid and criminal. His character should be brought up on charges or referred to the nearest psychoanalyst specializing in sadomasochism. Director David Ayer (""End of Watch"") has evidently decided that if you cant say anything new about war you should say the old stuff loudly and with images worthy of a gross-out horror flick. Most of Ayers imaginative power goes into orgies of violence -- mens legs being cut off by machine-gun fire a sliver of a face lying around like a dirty sock another man who has been run over so many times he has become one with the mud. But for all its 21st-century special effects the characters dialogue and values of ""Fury"" are straight out of the 50s. The 1650s maybe. Pitt plays Wardaddy a staff sergeant leading the four surviving members of his platoon deep into the heart of Germany in April 1945. (Adolf Hitler committed suicide on April 30). The comic-book name of the character tells you a lot Sarge is absurdly cool under fire always barking the right order at the right moment armed with macho quips and grizzled directives ""Put some f - - kin smoke in his face"" ""Pull your s - - t together"" ""Shut up and send me more pigs to kill."" None of that Tom Hanks in ""Saving Private Ryan"" shaky-hand stuff for him The only sign that hes under duress is a 10-second shudder he allows himself when no one is looking. To woo lady filmgoers Ayers tosses in a completely unconvincing scene that imagines people in severe deprivation and horror can fall in love in about 30 seconds. Norman (Logan Lerman) struggles with Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) asking him to kill a German soldier (Branko Tomovic).Photo Giles Keyte Sgt. Hero should probably be court-martialed for starting a tank battle while leaving many boxes of ammo sitting outside and drinking booze yet Ayer treats this too as an occasion for worship He thinks it looks so cool to have the star climb out of the tank in midfirefight to retrieve the rounds. The men are straight out of Cliche Battalion Theres a Christian (Shia LaBeouf) a guy who is mocked for speaking ""Mexican"" (Michael Pena) a mean-spirited cynic (Jon Bernthal) and the raw recruit (Logan Lerman) who needs to be retrained to enjoy killin -- even unarmed unresisting prisoners of war in cold blood. Thats a war crime not a baptism by fire. The film is at times a harrowing visceral experience -- you can almost smell the corpses as truckloads of them rumble through the mud -- and the grit of ""Fury"" makes a contribution of sorts. Yet I couldnt help suspecting that theres a pornographic leer to it all a savage glee. ""It will end soon but before it happens a lot more people gotta die"" Pitts character tells us. Thanks Sgt. Obvious but theres much more to war than just maximizing the body count and this films implication that getting mowed down a few days before wars end is more glorious than surrender is appalling juvenile and wrong.

"Fury lets Sgt. Brad Pitt roll on as history meets comic book review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFury lets Sgt. Brad Pitt roll on as history meets comic book reviewBattlefield reality and macho myth messily collide in David Ayers Fury a World War II drama that looks like a history lesson but unloads more like a comic book.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 16 2014FuryStarring Brad Pitt Shia LaBeouf Logan Lerman Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal. Directed by David Ayer. Opens Friday Oct. 17 at GTA theatres. 134 minutes. 14ABattlefield reality and macho myth messily collide in David Ayers Fury a World War II drama that looks like a history lesson but unloads more like a comic book.Brad Pitt seems as if hes picking up where he left off from Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds. He once again plays a drawling Nazi slayer who has no qualms about spilling Aryan blood -- as a head-stabbing kill quickly establishes at the outset.Article Continued BelowThis time though hes in considerably tighter quarters as tank commander Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier who is every bit as scarred as the Sherman machine he rolls across German terrain its gun muzzle scrawled with the ""Fury"" of the title. Brad Pitt plays Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier who is every bit as scarred as the Sherman machine he rolls across German terrain.Wardaddy is accompanied by the usual stereotypes lead gunner Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (Shia LaBeouf) who praises the Lord but also pulls the trigger; Latino driver Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Pena) who can turn Fury on a dime; mechanic Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (The Walking Deads Jon Bernthal) who might be in a psycho ward if not for WWII; and new guy Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) a typist and pacifist ""accidentally"" teamed with this crew who is going to have to learn how to kill or be killed.Its April 1945 and World War II is rapidly winding down but the losing Germans arent willing to go down quietly. In fact theyre going down angrily and violently especially on their homeland soil.""Why dont they just give up?"" another commander asks Wardaddy.""Would you?"" comes the world-wise reply.Brute force and blood are required to snap German resolve and push the Allied advance and thats exactly what Wardaddy and his men are trained to explosively deliver their killer instincts overriding their extreme exhaustion.A testosterone tinderbox like this is red meat for writer/director Ayer who has strayed far afield from the L.A. police dramas hes best known for among them Training Day (writer only) Harsh Times and End of Watch. But hes certainly no stranger to claustrophobic WWII experiences he co-wrote U-571 a 2000 thriller about a German U-boat commandeered by U.S. Navy men. Few can match Ayers gift for authentically gritty dialogue which he doesnt dilute with a surfeit of gallows humour even though a laugh or two might be appreciated. And the portrait he and Roman Vasyanov paint of the battered tank and the shell-ravaged landscape around it both drained of colour and humanity should be required viewing for anyone who thinks a ground war can be easily fought and won. (Although for my money the 2009 Israeli tank drama Lebanon is more instructive in this regard.)Attention to details give Fury heft and value as does solid acting but Ayer seems to lose his resolve in two scenes that are straight out of a Sgt. Fury Marvel Comics episode or maybe a Hollywood script rewrite.An interlude in which Wardaddy and his men invade the apartment of two terrified German women in a ruined town demanding food and companionship helps establish the basic decency of Pitts character and the difficulties he has reining in his brutish soldiers. But it runs so long it begins to feel like a cynical attempt to up the estrogen count in a movie more likely to attract male viewers than female ones.And the films bloody finale in which Wardaddy and his men choose to take on 300 SS soldiers in a crossroads shootout rather than flee to safety simply beggars belief. Their reckless heroism would make sense if they had a specific mission goal such as the D-Day beach assault depicted in Saving Private Ryan which Fury often evokes. There is no such goal here but the scene does serve to further illustrate the films most sage comment on war once again in the words of Wardaddy ""Ideals are peaceful history is violent.""Read more about Brad PittThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review Fury treads on war movie expectations as it hunts Nazis - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Fury treads on war movie expectations as Brad Pitt amp; Co. kill Nazis Fury Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Fury starring Brad Pitt Shia LaBeouf Logan Lerman. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Fury starring Brad Pitt Shia LaBeouf Logan Lerman. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Brad Pitt and his tank crew hunt Nazis in the final days of WWII in Europe in the bleak savage Fury If memorable war movies mean something to you open that book to a new page and add ""Fury"" to the list. It belongs there.Even if youre not keeping a list its hard not to be impressed by what writer-director David Ayer powerfully aided by star Brad Pitt and an exceptional below-the-line team has accomplished with this bleak and savage story of a World War II tank crew operating in Germany during the last month of the European war. The advance spin on ""Fury"" has been in the words of one of its producers that its ""not your grandfathers war movie."" Like most hype that turns out to be only half true. In fact what makes this film distinctive is the adroit way it both subverts and enhances old-school expectations grafting a completely modern sensibility onto thoroughly traditional material.For though they dont necessarily act in expected ways the five-person cross-section-of-humanity tank crew headed by Pitts Sgt. Don Collier a.k.a. Wardaddy fits squarely into familiar Hollywood models involving men doing what men have to do because no ones going to do it but them. This concern with codes of masculine behavior fits squarely into the preoccupations of filmmaker Ayer who wrote and directed the LAPD drama ""End of Watch."" Before that he wrote the ""Training Day"" script that won Denzel Washington an Oscar as well as co-wrote the underappreciated World War II submarine epic ""U-571."" Tank films that roll Susan King Susan King A bear for research Ayer has apparently been working on this story for years and under the command of skilled production designer Andrew Menzies ""Fury"" shows great concern for getting the specific details right even rounding up five authentic M4 Sherman tanks and one German Tiger to use in the production.That passion for getting close to physical reality leads to ""Furys"" most modern aspect its emphasis on the gory and extreme violence the men ferociously inflict and absorb and how that experience affects them. In some ways ""Fury"" sharply edited by Dody Dorn plays out as if the astonishing Omaha Beach slaughter that opened ""Saving Private Ryan"" had characterized an entire film. Review Fury treads on war movie expectations as it hunts Nazis Giles Keyte / Columbia Pictures Brad Pitt stars in ""Fury"" as a sergeant whos a lone wolf with an air of exhausted charisma. Pictured with Logan Lerman. Brad Pitt stars in ""Fury"" as a sergeant whos a lone wolf with an air of exhausted charisma. Pictured with Logan Lerman. (Giles Keyte / Columbia Pictures) With that as grounding Ayer working with fluid cinematographer Roman Vasyanov has felt free to engage in a kind of mythologizing. Yes the men of Sgt. Collins tank are driven by deadening blood lust and not ""greatest generation"" morality as they exult in frenzied violence but there is also an underlying and inevitable heroic tone. Those looking for the hipster jokiness that characterized Quentin Tarantinos ""Inglourious Basterds"" may well not be happy here. Set over an action-packed 24 hours in April 1945 ""Fury"" starts with a sudden move by Sgt. Collins that brutally ends the life of a German officer. As played by Pitt with a white sidewalls haircut and an air of exhausted charisma the sergeant is very much an enigma a lone wolf who is a law unto himself. The actors stardom is ""Furys"" core advantage We are hard-wired to be on his team no matter how far beyond the pale his actions go.In some intangible way the men who share this tank with the sergeant (whos occasionally called ""Top"" perhaps in tribute to Burt Lancaster in ""From Here to Eternity"") feel it is the force of his will that has kept those of them still alive safe and sound. That and their unquenchable zeal for killing.These men include gunner Boyd Swan (a surprisingly effective Shia LaBeouf) a born again type who prays over Germans after he kills them; loader Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (Jon Bernthal) the teams most atavistic member; and driver Trini Garcia (""End of Watch"" veteran Michael Pena.) Like siblings in a dysfunctional family these men are committed to the group but needle each other something fierce.Because the tanks fifth crew member the assistant driver has just been killed new guy Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) joins the group. He is not just a new guy he is practically an infant in the Army just eight weeks and trained to be a clerk typist. He is not happy to be where he is and the rest of the crew are not happy to have him there.This is not so much because of his inexperience as his scruples the fact that he does not understand as the other men especially the sergeant do that wholesale bloodshed is to be the order of the day and that avoiding it endangers not only his life but those of the rest of the men.As the tank heads out on a bloody series of missions it will be the business of Sgt. Collins to educate this young audience surrogate to make him believe that ""were not here for right and wrong. You kill him or he kills you."" Or as he puts it more poetically ""ideals are peaceful. History is violent.""Along with realism about the violence one of the themes of ""Fury"" is not only that people are capable of horrors -- ""Wait till you see what a man can do to another man"" Boyd tells Norman early on -- but also that individuals can come to tolerate if not relish the process. ""Best job I ever had"" is one of the catchphrases the men in this killing machine use with each other and the ghastly thing is they half believe its true.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------FuryMPAA rating R for strong sequences of war violence some grisly images and language throughout.Running time 2 hours 14 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Column Entertainment Action (Movie Genre) Brad Pitt End of Watch (movie) Fury trailer Brad Pitt gets gritty again in Fury 5 lessons from his recent work Fury director David Ayers rugged style was a hit with Brad Pitt Fury should top Gone Girl at box office this weekend Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-fury-review-20141017-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,fury(2014)19,fury(2014),latimes

By CHRIS VOGNAR Follow chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 16 October 2014 0450 PM Updated 16 October 2014 0629 PM Related Strong cast elevates familiar tale in St. Vincent (B+) Jeremy Renner is superb as a reporter uncovering some nasty truths in Kill the Messenger (B+) War is hell. Its also relentless unsparing unsentimental and violent to the mind body and soul. Fury conveys these truths with brute force and lean precise drama.This is no Greatest Generation reverie. The films band of World War II brothers grinding it out near the end of the deadliest conflict in history is resigned to its task Kill them before they kill you.The desperate hours have begun for the German army defending its country with a last gasp of rage and pride. A Sherman tank crew led by Brad Pitts Wardaddy wends its way through the German countryside beneath slate gray skies. The rest of the crew played by Michael Pena Shia LaBeouf Jon Bernthal and Logan Lerman operates as a single organism. Theyre tired of one anothers company and tired of war but theyre also hooked on it. Aside from Lermans newcomer theyve been together in the same tank through Africa Belgium France and now Germany. As a survival mechanism theyve convinced themselves they love it.Pitt has the rugged movie star role and all four supporting actors are excellent. (Dallas Jim Parrack is also good in a secondary role.) But the center of dramatic gravity is Lerman best-known as the young writer in The Perks of Being a Wallflower. As a battlefield rookie thrown into a veteran crew he conveys the elusive quality of moral panic. He has a firm grasp of the obvious Thou shalt not kill. The terror in his eyes comes from realizing he has to.Fury is to tank warfare what Das Boot was to the dread of life on a German U-boat. The crews vehicle which gives the movie its name is for most intents and purposes their home. The combat sequences are intricate and visceral and the carnage is sudden and graphic. ""Short bursts harvest more meat per bullet"" explains a veteran to the rookie and hes not talking about steak. The interludes provide brief relief. A long sequence in the home of two German women (Anamaria Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg) plays like a barbed Last Supper of resentment with flashes of humanity. This chapter ends with a heavy hand but not before nods to Jean Renoirs timeless World War I film Grand Illusion.Some will find Fury jingoistic or not sufficiently anti-war. Others may find its claustrophobia monotonous. I was pulled in by its embrace of pure cinema its execution of tricky battle sequences and its unflinching portrait of five guys with a job to do.""Best job in the world"" the guys periodically repeat under their breath. They say it with the gallows humor of men who have seen too much. FURY (B+)Directed by David Ayer. R (strong sequences of war violence grisly images and language throughout). 134 mins.

Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier in the 2014 World War II tank drama ""Fury."" Photo Credit AP / Sony Pictures Entertainment advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT During the last days of World War II a tank crew undertakes a dangerous mission. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE For all the extra blood and brutality this is still a macho and romanticized war movie. Pitt serves honorably in the John Wayne role. CAST Brad Pitt Shia LaBeouf Logan Lerman Michael Pena LENGTH 214 In the opening moments of ""Fury"" David Ayers film about the nasty brutish business of war a knife-wielding American soldier named Wardaddy ambushes a German officer. It isnt enough to stab his victim in the chest and heart. He ends with a flourish piercing the Nazis left eye with an audible squirt. Talk about driving home a point. ""Fury"" named after Wardaddys bullet-pocked Sherman tank is determined to be not-your-fathers World War II movie. That genre born in the 1940s as a form of morale-boosting entertainment cast Hollywood strong jaws like John Wayne in leading roles and tended to omit unplesantries like say putrefied corpses. ""Fury"" does the opposite and even adds touches of despair and pointlessness. The action begins in April 1945 mere weeks before Germanys surrender -- but first says Wardaddy ""a lot more people have to die.""

Speaking of Hollywood types thats Brad Pitt as Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier a taciturn and literally battle-scarred tank commander whose loyal crew of miscreants are driver Trini (Michael Pena) Bible-quoting gunner Boyd (Shia LaBeouf) and redneck ammo loader Grady (Jon Bernthal). Joining them is knock-kneed newcomer Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) a young typist who never imagined hed be sent behind enemy lines to help halt a Nazi advance. ""Fury"" recalls Francois Truffauts old dictum that an anti-war film is impossible; war is simply too engaging and visually exciting to resist. Not surprisingly what works best in ""Fury"" are the action sequences. Writer- director Ayer (""Training Day"") does a good job of putting us inside the tank Fury and one of the films best scenes is a deadly chess game between several Shermans and a seemingly unstoppable German Tiger tank. 237 MoviesIn theaters Fury What rings false are the hastily sketched characters and the big obvious ideas they symbolize. In one scene Norman discovers a young beauty Emma (Alicia von Rittberg) wearing a summer dress and fresh makeup -- a suitable outfit for representing purity though not for hiding from American invaders. Meanwhile American soldiers utter wise maxims like ""Ideals are peaceful history is violent"" usually before lighting another unfiltered Lucky Strike. ""Fury"" is bloody brutal and occasionally entertaining but its also full of baloney. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT During the last days of World War II a tank crew undertakes a dangerous mission.

The heavy-handed pale horse/death analogy aside the scene sets the tone for what turns out to be not just another World War II movie. This one depicts ""greatest-generation"" Americans as the numbed conscience-free fighters that many had become by April 1945 the final weeks of battle on German soil.

But writer/director David Ayer has accomplished something arguably more noble unstintingly sacrificing the sheen of idealism for the less-photogenic truth of war -- long periods of slogging through mud and sharing way-too-close quarters interrupted by short bursts of terror and carnage. ""Fury"" -- the tanks name crudely painted on its gun barrel -- is one of a handful of Shermans built by Ford that havent yet been blown up by the retreating Germans superior tanks built by Porsche. Wardaddy presides over this dank micro-fiefdom and his four motley charges an evangelical Christian called Bible (Shia LaBeouf) cynical tough-talker Gordo (Michael Pena whose excellent understated performance should earn him leading-man status) crass knuckledragger Coon-Ass (Jon Bernthal of ""The Walking Dead"") and Norman a bewildered baby-faced newbie gunner plucked from the typing pool (Logan Lerman of ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower""). The guys reportedly were made to rough it for realisms sake spending a week in an English bivouac before shooting and it shows. LaBeouf looks a good 10 years older than his 28 and even the resolutely handsome Pitt is all eyebags worry lines and Kim Jong Un haircut. ""Do as youre told and dont get too close to anyone"" Wardaddy tells comparatively namby-pamby Norman. Just two months after entering boot camp Norman was tasked with cleaning the remains of the guy hes replacing a hunk of flesh including an ear from inside the tank. After being ordered to machine-gun a heap of bodies on the ground to make sure theyre all dead Norman blubbers that he ""cant be here anymore"" to which ol tough-love Wardaddy replies ""I promised my men Id keep them alive. Youre getting in the way of that."" Columbia Pictures The ""Fury"" crew from left Shia LaBeouf Logan Lerman Brad Pitt Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal. Later he waxes bluntly philosophical ""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent."" Brow-raisers like these lines might leave you wishing Ayer had chosen his screenplays moments of poetic license more carefully. A scene in which Wardaddy invites himself and Norman into the home of a frightened German woman and her comely young niece for a bit of Ramp;R provides visual and psychological relief from the unrelenting run-together olive drabs grays and browns of the barren battlefields at times indistinguishable from the soldiers uniforms. But it goes on too long for an off-key hard-to buy segue a fleeting romance between Norman and the girl. In a suspensefully staged if predictable climax the underdog quintet face off against an SS brigade staggeringly outnumbered. ""Fury"" may not be the most memorable of World War II movies but its a visceral ride.

Photo/Video Sony Pictures By John Anderson Oct. 16 2014 213 p.m. ET 15 COMMENTS Does charisma trump psychosis? That will be one of the questions raised by director David Ayers volatile defiantly iconoclastic ""Fury"" which casts Brad Pitt violently against type and opens with a shot that is about everything the film is not--the honor majesty and splendor of war Against a smoky sun an officer on horseback--upright in the saddle silhouetted against the unsettled sky--rides toward the camera and across a battlefield littered with the ennobled remains of total war. Then an American soldier jumps from behind a tank turret knocks the stunned German off his animal and stabs him efficiently and finally through the eye socket. Sic transit gloria mundi. More Reviews Birdman Camp X-Ray The soldier with the knife and the sneak attack is played by Mr. Pitt who in a bold tactical strike against his own well-entrenched screen persona plays a combat-weary psychotically disturbed tank commander called Wardaddy at least in the credits and ""Top"" by the equally unstable members of his crew. All have nicknames and field-cultivated personality disorders Gordo (Michael Pena) a fatalistic tank driver; Coon-Ass (Jon Bernthal) a vicious hillbilly; Bible (Shia LaBeouf) a persistently evangelical Christian; and the late-inning addition Norman Ellison (the terrific Logan Lerman) who despite being trained as a clerk-typist is thrown in among battle-hardened GIs who not only despise him for his undamaged humanity but figure he will somehow get them killed. They come close to being right. But what is refreshing about Norman who is technically the hero of Mr. Ayerss screenplay is that he manages to maintain his dignity kill scores of Nazis and not succumb to any milquetoasty stereotypes. Whats poignant about Norman in addition to his loss of reserve about killing Nazis (""In fact I kinda liked it"") is the way his anger is generated by fear--he and his comrades rage against the Germans partly because the enemy is making them fearful. Its the fuel that keeps ""Fury"" burning along with its villages tanks and humans. ""Fury"" is being sold as a combination buddy movie and classic action-adventure war saga both of which to some degree it is. There is certainly a brotherhood-of-war at work; the general mayhem the whiz of the tracer bullets and the immediacy of blood will whiten knuckles. But the movies importance if that is not being too grand is its place in history as told by Hollywood. World War II is often called the ""last good war"" which has also meant that it was the last global conflict out of which the studios could make an unabashedly heroic movie. ""Fury"" is not that movie. And because it is not it provides a few psychic disturbances beyond its shocking gore burning soldiers blowing their brains out children hanged from trees by the SS and imminent rape. One nerve-wrackingly remarkable scene doesnt involve combat at all but rather Normans tryst as it were with a young German occupant of a conquered German village. Shes a hostage essentially and implications are that things for her are going to get a lot worse soon. ""Fury"" makes a very good argument that war is not just hell but the great equalizer Enough unspeakable carnage and a soldier can become a vengeful sexual psychopath regardless of race religion or ethnic origin. Related Reading Brad Pitt Stars in World War II-Era Fury (Oct. 9) Other directors have stripped the gloss off World War II including Sam Fuller Terence Malick and Steven Spielberg (at least during his D-Day invasion of ""Saving Private Ryan""). But Mr. Ayers goes somewhere else. His core group is at the end of its rope. They have been killing Germans since North Africa and have been rendered homicidal by the experience partly because the conflict seems fated never to end Normandy has already happened. Germany should have surrendered. Instead a desperate Third Reich is putting children into uniform. That the Americans of the armored divisions are at a technological disadvantage (the Sherman being no match for the Panzer) adds to what might jokingly be termed ""stress"" Every battle that destroys a Nazi tank involves three American vehicles and the loss of two. These kinds of odds might make a man crazy. And in ""Fury"" they do. 102 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Floating Food Forest Arrives in New York City RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Fury written and directed with exacting skill and aching heart by David Ayer (End of Watch) doesnt let us off easy with vid-game violence. Ayer thrusts us into the furnace of the Fury a Sherman tank commanded by Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) until we feel as battered as the crew. More News Fall Movie Preview Finally the Good Stuff Brad Pitt From Beefcake to A-Lister Shia LaBeouf Arrested for Disorderly Conduct All Stories >> In their years with Sgt. Wardaddy gunner Boyd Swan (an outstanding Shia LaBeouf) loader Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) and driver Trini Garcia (Michael Pena) have tilted their moral compass to view murder as different from killing the enemy. They dont even see the blood on their hands until the arrival of Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) a rookie driver unprepared for combat. Normans horror and disgust are a cracked mirror for the crew until Norman hardens just like his band of brothers. Ayer captures the buried feelings of men in combat with piercing immediacy. Pitt is tremendous in the role a conscience detectable even in Wardaddys blinkered gaze. But its Lerman who anchors the film with a shattering unforgettable portrayal of corrupted innocence.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Battle-scarred Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) top left leads a team of soldiers operating a Sherman tank near the end of World War II in ""Fury."" (Giles Keyte/Sony Pictures Entertainment) By Michael OSullivan October 16 2014 The bloody World War II action film ""Fury"" takes its name from the sobriquet of a Sherman tank its barrel emblazoned with -- and its mission defined by -- that angry word. But its inside the battered vehicle among the members of its tight-knit crew where the movies real action takes place. Set in 1945 during the Allies final push into Germany -- an endgame marked by desperation and moral compromise on both sides -- ""Fury"" is a tale whose message can be summed up as follows ""Ideals are peaceful; history is violent."" But the better and more hard-hitting story centers on the man who delivers that nihilistic assessment the battle-scarred tank commander known as Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) and his relationship with his four-man crew. As his nickname implies Pitts character is a kind of damaged father figure tough and tender in equal measure. As rendered by filmmaker David Ayer (whose track record includes both the gritty cop drama ""End of Watch"" and the horrible Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle ""Sabotage"") the combat narrative in ""Fury"" makes for the more familiar of two competing story lines. Although filmed with a visceral -- and often shockingly grisly -- beauty as well as pulse-quickening drama the movie is only passably interesting as a war movie especially when measured against classics such as ""Paths of Glory."" Still its engaging and watchable even as it marches toward a seemingly suicidal climax. Yet the complex dynamic between Wardaddy and his men is far more fascinating. As the soldiers paterfamilias pledged to keep his ""sons"" alive but also to teach them something about living and dying Pitt is riveting as the films antihero. Wardaddys successes and failures as a parent and leader are the most engrossing and novel things about ""Fury."" His success is evident in the fact that the crew has survived three years of fighting with only one casualty in a war notable for its heavy American tank losses. Having rolled from Africa to France to Germany the weathered crew consists of Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (Shia LaBeouf); Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Pena) and Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (Jon Bernthal). As the film opens an untested clerk-typist named Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) has just joined them replacing a dead gunner. There are a few other things The Reliable Source learned about Brad Pitt from his co-stars and himself at the world premiere of ""Fury"" on Wednesday night. (JulieAnn McKellogg and Alice Li/The Washington Post) His first assignment? Swabbing out his predecessors blood and guts from inside the tank. As with all his films Ayer doesnt shy from graphic imagery. Unlike the other crew members who are known almost exclusively by their ""war names"" Norman hasnt yet taken on a nickname though he will by the end of the movie. He also will take on more than that. One lesson Wardaddy is just a man and in some ways a very poor role model. A key interlude in the middle of the story set in the home of two German women (Anamarina Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg) whose apartment has been commandeered for a meal is particularly telling. In it Wardaddy allows his men to misbehave at times grotesquely -- the implication being that he turns a blind eye to actions approaching the criminal out of expedience. In another scene Wardaddy forces a reluctant Norman to execute a captured S.S. officer. The uncomfortable dynamic is an obscene parody of a father back home teaching his son how to hunt. With the general exception of the Nazi fighters -- only one of whom is shown to have any compassion -- few characters in ""Fury"" are depicted as wholly good or wholly evil. Its easy to see the movie as a story of how war makes monsters out of men. But its a good deal more complicated than that. The film suggests that it isnt war that does that but people like Wardaddy. This is a man who knows the price of keeping his men alive to fight or to die another day and is willing to pay it.   1/2 R. At area theaters.

Photo Handout HO / McClatchy-Tribune News Service Fury review Brad Pitt in command of World War II epic 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Around the turn of the millennium Hollywood fell in love again with World War II. Awash in millennial optimism living in peace and prosperity Americans enjoyed contemplating the struggles that defined their parents and grandparents lives. We watched movies about ""the good war"" and ""the greatest generation"" that fought it and no matter how brutal the combat depicted there was a certain romanticism about it all. Then came 9/11 and we suddenly had too many of our own problems to be fretting over what Grandpa went through. War wasnt unthinkable and distant. War was in the headlines. And so World War II movies went away ... until now with ""Fury"" a film thats nothing like the ones made 15 years ago. ""Fury"" is the first World War II movie inflected by a post 9/11 post-Iraq post-Afghanistan 21st century point of view. It takes place in Germany in April 1945 just a few weeks before the end of the war in Europe and one of the first things you realize is that its just as easy to get killed on the last day of a war as the first. Four guys are in a tank along with the body of a fifth and aside from the dead guy nobody is getting along. Theyre dirty theyre exhausted and theyve been brutalized and coarsened. Theyre not better people for having been in combat. Theyre much worse. More movies Movie review Yogananda gave yoga meditation to America The Best of Me review Some of the worst of Nicholas Sparks The Book of Life review Bursting with la vida A great movie lets you know youre in safe hands from the beginning. In ""Fury"" as the crew led by their Sergeant (Brad Pitt) rolls into headquarters writer-director David Ayer cuts to images of the surroundings such as a forlorn steer separated from the herd and a bulldozer pushing bodies into a mass grave. What extraordinary restraint on the part of Ayer and his editors (Jay Cassidy and Dody Dorn) not to linger on these images but rather to flash on them for a second or two. The men after all wouldnt linger either. This has become commonplace. At its best ""Fury"" examines the psychological experience of warfare. When the replacement for their dead gunner turns out to be a green kid in his early 20s with no combat experience the men are disgusted. Partly theyre alarmed at the danger of having a novice defending their flank. But mainly and most interesting theyre repelled by his innocence. They have an impulse to be cruel to him not to toughen him up but because his unexamined faith that life makes sense is repugnant. Ayer is best known as the screenwriter of ""Training Day"" and in an odd way ""Fury"" bears a family resemblance to it. The story is mainly told from the standpoint of the young recruit (Logan Lerman) thrown into danger under the tutelage of a charismatic battle-hardened veteran. (The young mans first assignment is to get a bucket and clean up the mess inside the tank. He finds on one of the surfaces the skin of someones face and an eyeball.) Like ""Training Day"" ""Fury"" takes place in a condensed time frame in which a lifetimes worth of experiences are crammed into a period of hours. Every year movies give us a handful of perfect sequences scenes that are so good that they can become part of the landscape of our minds. In ""Fury"" we find one such scene when the sergeant and the young man go into a house occupied by two German women (Anamaria Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg). To talk about story details would damage the experience. But if you see it make sure to savor the complexity and shifting nature of the emotion and the precision with which Ayer conveys it. Also note how Ayer doesnt take the sentimental way out even when the audience wants him to. Finally pay attention to Pitt and the masterful way he and Ayer use his silences. In its last half hour ""Fury"" takes on some of the contours of a conventional war film and becomes less about the damage that war inflicts on the soul. But the battle sequences are effective -- not a flood of quick cuts but always clear. And Ayer never forgets that the actual people are doing the fighting.

Comments click to enlarge Fury Video Rated R  136 minutes  2014 This gory big-budget World War II movie by writer-director David Ayer (End of Watch) recalls Saving Private Ryan in its assured craftsmanship and underlying hypocrisy. On the one hand Ayer wants to critique the mythologizing of Hollywood war films subverting his classic premise--a tight-knit American tank crew undertake a risky mission into Nazi territory--by making most of the principal characters amoral or even barbaric. On the other hand he also wants to deliver a rousing action spectacle so in the combat scenes any moral ambiguity goes out the window. Brad Pitt stars as a subdued version of his no-nonsense sergeant from Inglourious Basterds; playing his men are Shia LeBeouf Logan Lerman Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal.

(AP Photo/Sony Pictures Entertainment Giles Keyte) The Associated Press This photo released by Sony Pictures Entertainment shows Brad Pitt as Wardaddy in a scene from ""Fury."" (AP Photo/Sony Pictures Entertainment Giles Keyte) In the final days of World War II tank commander Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) and his men are on the move through Germany when a newcomer joins their ranks. His name is Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) and hes been trained as a typist -- not an assistant driver. To make matters worse Ellisons hesitance to shoot at the enemy does not endear him to Wardaddy.But its not long before Ellison abandons his idealism and begins firing away -- which puts him on the same ideological page as Wardaddy gunner Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf) loader Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) and driver Trini Garcia (Michael Pena). Their goal of helping to ensure Allied success happily coincides with a more personal one staying alive.Unfortunately the Germans are determined to keep fighting. And that means that an already bloody war has a chance to get even bloodier. Written and directed by David Ayer the tough but terrific ""Fury"" may remind moviegoers of Steven Spielbergs ""Saving Private Ryan"" another film that addressed the horrors of World War II. But Ayer who made his name as a screenwriter (""Training Day"") takes an approach closer in sensibility to European than Hollywood filmmaking. If ""Ryan"" was something less than a rah-rah portrayal of war ""Fury"" is even bleaker in its depiction of its dehumanizing effects.In a strong performance Pitt cant help but bring to mind his turn in ""Inglourious Basterds"" as a character obsessed with ""one thing and one thing only killing Nazis."" But unlike Lt. Aldo Raine who seemed to regard war as an absurd joke Wardaddy stares it down with dead seriousness. Lerman perhaps best known for ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is empathetic as a man who must change to survive. And LaBeouf who has recently attracted his share of tabloid attention delivers one of his best performances. ""Fury"" is a guided tour through a manmade hell.What ""Fury""  Three and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 213  Content War violence grisly images and language STL native helps Brad Pitt keep it real on reel WWII vet Paul Andert met with Pitt about new film Fury Tags Fury Brad Pitt Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-dispatch War Battle Review Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

A tank crew does battle in April 1945. Director David Ayer (214). R Violence language. Area theaters. Weve seen World War II films that depict Allied forces as heroic conflicted or flawed flying victorious in the air or marching in the mud in despair. But ""Fury"" excels in showing the ground-level guttural intensity and claustrophobia of battle. Writer-director David Ayer doesnt break new ground here. He isnt trying to. Ayer works with archetypes (the hardened vet the fearful new recruit the Bible-quoter the brute) and places them against familiar backdrops (bombed-out village farmhouse-dotted countryside). But the movies inner space -- inside the heads of its tank battalion and inside the tank itself -- is what grabs you as gripping battle scenes shake you. During the final months of the war the crew in the Sherman tank theyve nicknamed Fury are under the command of Wardaddy (Brad Pitt). His battle scars are visible and his judgment is sharp. Gordo (Michael Pena) Swan (Shia LaBeouf) and Travis (Jon Bernthal) have just lost a gunner in their last skirmish. Their new fifth member is Norman (Logan Lerman) a clerk who enlisted only a few weeks earlier. The crew of Fury Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf) Norman (Logan Lerman) Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) Trini Garcia (Michael Pena) and Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal). (Giles Keyte) As they roll into Germany Wardaddy is warned by a grizzled officer (Jason Isaacs) that Nazi forces are desperate dug in and even more dangerous. The tank squad discovers that for themselves during several bloody battles against a German panzer division. When a tank is disabled on a seemingly quiet road Wardaddy makes a stand -- with minimal artillery -- against scores of German soldiers. The kinetic action scenes are exciting. The rocket fire is tinged with ever-so-slight green or red flashes of light. But ""Fury"" works best because of a stoic heart and lack of modern attitude. Among recent works the films closer to ""Saving Private Ryan"" than ""Inglourious Basterds."" Wardaddys view of war is severe and single-minded without a larger sense of purpose about the conflict. Brad Pitt plays veteran Wardaddy in ""Fury."" (Giles Keyte) Pitt makes his terrific performance feel lived-in and shadowy continuing an acting evolution thats taken him out of marquee stardom and into stern masculine middle age. The actors around him are all solid. LaBeouf finally finds a role he can disappear into without his image getting in the way. Ayers mission here is to capture the hell men do to each other. Thats why an extended middle scene -- when Wardaddy and Norman improvise an awkward moment of humanity with two German women -- doesnt click. Civility is something Wardaddy and the men he pushes to the edge have lost sight of. Wardaddy (Brad Pitt r.) with Norman (Logan Lerman) in ""Fury"" (Giles Keyte) ""Fury"" works best when it lets us see the brutality of war and how it closes in on damaged souls. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

A gloom that only the audience can see hangs over writer-director David Ayers brutal war drama Fury. Its April 1945 and we know that in weeks the Nazis will surrender. The war is already over -- Hitler just hasnt admitted it. American sergeant Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) suspects as much but he isnt sure. And so he and the four other men in his tank roll on through the German countryside shooting and dodging a final barrage of bullets that is no less fatal for being futile. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - This is an ugly part of an ugly war and Ayer wallows in it. Instead of flags and patriotism Fury is about filth the basins of blood the smears on the soldiers exhausted faces the bodies pushed around by bulldozers a decomposing corpse thats melted into the mud. (Thank heavens Ayer has no way to make us smell the inside of the tank.) What beauty remains is fleeting an overly symbolic white horse; a pretty sad-eyed blonde; a brief shot of the sky with dozens of planes streaking wingtip-to-wingtip like a fine-tooth comb. Yet the film wont shake off the threat of death long enough to let us enjoy these pleasures. Instead even happiness comes draped in dread. At any minute Ayer could punish us for letting our guard down.The mens moods are equally dark. Colliers team -- dumb hick Grady (Jon Bernthal) temperamental but wounded Gordo (Michael Pena) and stock religious guy Bible (Shia LaBeouf groomed like Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) -- has been together since Africa and has had the mixed fortune of surviving every battle. The squads fifth man has just been shot and the first thing his replacement a typist named Norman (Logan Lerman) is ordered to do is mop up his predecessors blood and dispose of his face which has been flung in the corner like melted cheese.Film Details Fury RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time135 min. More Info Trailer This is a film about present-traumatic stress disorder a condition none of the men have words to express. Ayer crams three years of anguish into the first 30 minutes horrors we get no time to process. The camera whips past starving women butchering horses and rooms of German aristocrats who have committed suicide so that on some dark animal level Fury makes us empathize with these pitiless American heroes who cant care about anything or anyone. Colliers men are neutral toward their home country and the families theyve left behind who go unmentioned as though theyre fantasies these soldiers no longer hope to see. Theyre cruel to the Germans who just wont give up. When the Americans march an SS soldier through their camp Collier attacks him with the reflexive rage of a fighting dog.

Sep. 13 600pm But theyre also cruel to innocents like Norman who dont understand the life-and-death decisions theyve had to make -- especially now that the SS has forced every boy who can fight into the German army. Norman cant pull the trigger on a child soldier and hesitates long enough to get another Yankee killed. A furious Collier orders him to fire even if the enemy is ""a baby with a butter knife"" and then he and the gang start scuffing up Normans soul. In one scene Collier commands Norman to execute an unarmed German. The most wrenching thing about the will-he-or-wont-he suspense is how little everyone else in the film cares. Theyve seen so much death that all they can do is stand on the sidelines and snicker.Collier is scary and if he werent played by Brad Pitt an actor who gravitates to role models the part would be fully terrifying. Hes one of the good guys of course -- in 70 years Hollywood has never dared question the innate sainthood of the Greatest Generation. Yet when he bursts into the apartment of two German girls with Norman trotting behind theres a long and terrible pause where we arent sure if the women are safe. They are and they arent. Collier isnt loutish enough for rape; he just assumes theyll half-willingly drop their skirts for a half-dozen fresh eggs.Fury is structured like a string of grenades. Colliers tank just keeps chugging toward the next explosion and the men inside are so fixated on survival that no one takes the time to ask what it all means.Perhaps at this time and this place war means nothing -- its just what they do because theyve forgotten everything else. But Ayer has rolled his film into a dead end. Hes ground us down into feeling that life is trivial yet he needs a finale that makes us care about the fate of Colliers crew.In trying to say that death is both noble and pointless Fury makes the fatal mistake of so many war movies It divides up the battlefield so that our deaths are lofty and the enemies deaths mean nothing. For every cut on the Americans arms a dozen Germans are crushed like toy soldiers. Its a queasy climax for a film that otherwise strives to keep everyone equal in the muck.Fortunately the images that linger arent of this post-dated propaganda but of morbid absurdity which is Ayers gift an aerial shot of two rival tanks circling each other side by side each desperate to get the better shot. Watching from above it makes the final days of World War II look like a chess game where theyre out of pawns to sacrifice but neither side will draw.FURY | Written and directed by David Ayer | Columbia Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Fury (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Fury (R) Brad Pitt stars in this World War II drama about tank warfare. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/16/2014 Editor rating 2 In the World War II drama Fury Brad Pitt plays Sgt. Don Collier a flinty no-nonsense commander of a Sherman tank with a four-man crew who has been assigned a difficult mission inside German territory. Seeing Pitt in military fatigues and short-cropped hair you cant help but think of his performance in Inglourious Basterds where he played an equally ruthless but more amiable even funny leader. That character is missed. Collier like the rest of his men has survived too many horrors to have anything left but a sardonic sense of humor. When one of the crew is killed he is replaced by the baby-faced Norman (Logan Lerman) who barely knows how to shoot a machine gun and is constantly hazed by his new mates (Shia LaBeouf Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal). Early in the film -- in one of its best scenes -- Collier forces Norman to execute a German instead of taking him prisoner because he knows this kid needs to be able to kill if he has any hopes of surviving. The odds are not good. Writer-director David Ayer who previously specialized in crime dramas that often focused on police corruption (Training Day Harsh Times) shoots Fury in a straightforward manner almost as if he were making it in the 1940s. The battles are ferocious -- the Germans Tiger tanks are far more powerful and harder to take out than the American machines -- and even if the characters in the film are all stock types Fury reminds you of the insane courage these men displayed by going to fight an enemy that had the tactical advantage on practically every side (Bernthals prickly hillbilly is still annoying though). As a testament to the valor of the military Fury achieves its mission. But as entertainment it doesnt work as well. Theres a long interlude in which the men have a meal at the home of three women who feed and care for them. Theres a sexual tension underlying the scene -- these men are not in their right minds; they are brutes -- but the way Ayer lets the scene play out manages to be tender and realistic at the same time. Then its boom-boom time again leading to a climax reminiscent of one of those Star Trek movies in which the U.S.S. Enterprise is crippled surrounded and outnumbered by the enemy. But Star Trek was sci-fi; Fury aims for history and the contrived resolution shows a timidity by Ayer that is uncharacteristic of his previous work. Still the action sequences which use actual vintage tanks and little CGI are pretty extraordinary and at times incredibly gruesome. War is hell. Thats entertainment folks.

"Fury review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Fury  1/2 Brad Pitts Fury is rarely dull but a frustrating experience Despite some of the new WWII film ""Furys"" ""filmmaking intelligence"" the movies flaws do not ""play the subject honestly"" says film critic Michael Phillips. Despite some of the new WWII film ""Furys"" ""filmmaking intelligence"" the movies flaws do not ""play the subject honestly"" says film critic Michael Phillips. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Brad Pitt Shia LaBeouf and Logan Lerman co-star with a Sherman tank in David Ayers fire-breathing WWII drama ""Fury"" is a mixture of sharp realism and squishy cliches that combat movies dont really need anymore. It stars Brad Pitt as a 2nd Armored Division sergeant known as Wardaddy commander of a battle-scarred Sherman tank whose nickname painted on its gun barrel gives writer-director David Ayers film its title.Coming off his LAPD drive-around chronicle ""End of Watch"" Ayer once again gravitates toward hard men in deadly roving circumstances. ""Fury"" compresses a dozen World War II movies worth of tension conflict and carnage in a single 24-hour narrative set in April 1945. The story grinds into motion when a youthful scared desk jockey (Logan Lerman) joins Wardaddys crew and the men wonder if the new kid spells doom for everyone sharing tight quarters inside the tank. ""Waitll you see what a man can do to another man"" warns the Christian gunner played by Shia LaBeouf to Norman the reluctant assistant driver Logan portrays. The hazing Norman endures is rough; his fellow soldiers are merciless in getting Norman up to killing speed. Michael Pena plays the tank driver Trini upbraided by Pitts Wardaddy for ""talking Mexican."" The loader Grady a swamp rat played by Jon Bernthal at first barely recognizes Norman as a fellow human being. Gradys a lost cause and knows it; Normans pure of heart and noble of spirit and the second he utters his credo -- ""My conscience is clean; Im keeping it that way"" -- you know ""Fury"" will send Norman through the wringer without challenging Gradys initial impression.Early on Wardaddy finds a few seconds alone and reveals just how nerve-wracked and panicky the war has made him. Then its back to business. As Wardaddy and his men engage in fierce tank-vs.-tank combat with the Germans often in frighteningly close proximity ""Fury"" struggles to reconcile its own warring impulses. How much ""fun"" should the carnage in this sort of picture be really? Ayer has a facility both for hard-driving melodrama and relentless guts-spilling action bordering on the gamers sensibility without falling prey to it entirely. He can write. He can also overwrite. The extensive talk in ""Fury"" regarding good and evil God and the devil and mans inhumanity to man gets pretty thick. ""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent"" Wardaddy says at one point although nothing he says either before or after that line suggests a man who thinks in those sorts of thesis statements. The culminating battle finds whats left of Fury and her men squaring off against dozens and dozens of desperate Germans hours from the end of the war. Here the realism fades and Ayer favors a more impersonal more commercial form of carnage. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. The films lyric interlude set in a German town recently taken by the Allies sets up virginal Norman (with the help of his avenging-angel mentor Wardaddy) with a local girl (Alicia von Rittberg). Wardaddy relaxes demurely in the company of the young womans more worldly cousin played by the superb Romanian actress Anamaria Marinca. The problem with this scene which is pretty interesting is that it feels like a war movie as opposed to war.Why couldnt Ayer follow up on that early panicky glimpse of Wardaddy with any other hint in ""Fury"" of his protagonists demons? A handful of revisions tweaks and adjustments along with a musical score less bombastically grandiose mightve made this a film to remember.There is at least one great film set inside a tank among ordinary soldiers. Its from Israel ""Lebanon"" (2009) dealing with the 1982 Lebanon war. There the claustrophobia feeds the human drama every second. In that picture theres a quotation taped to the tank wall ""Man is steel. The tank is only iron."" Ayer believes likewise though at its weakest ""Fury"" contributes a frustrating percentage of tin to go with the iron and steel. ""Fury"" - 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong sequences of war violence some grisly images and language throughout)Running time 213.Opens Fridaymjphillipstribune.com Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Reviews Brad Pitt Logan Lerman Shia LaBeouf Michael Pena End of Watch (movie) Review St. Vincent  Review Whiplash  Review Dead Snow 2 Red vs. Dead  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising71deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-fury-20141016-column.html#navtype=barker&barkername=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It,200,fury(2014)34,fury(2014),chicagotribune

Share Tweet David Ayers gruesome World War II flick Fury aims to do for the Greatest Generation what his previous films have done for the LAPD and DEA painting the crew of an M4 Sherman tank as cruel and crooked soldiers on the front line of a war against an evil greater than themselves. In Ayer Land good is a fragile and irrelevant thing; what matters is camaraderie and the struggle of bad against evil. ""Ideals are peaceful history is violent"" says the tanks commander Wardaddy (Brad Pitt). Its April 1945 and he and his crew of Neanderthals--Coon-Ass (Jon Bernthal) Gordo (Michael Pena) and Bible (Shia LaBeouf)--are tearing through the muddy countryside of Germany slitting throats killing prisoners and forcing their way into the homes of local women.Its all very Peckinpah--or at least it could be if Ayer had any sense of poetry. (The closest he gets here is the recurring motif of a white horse wandering the battlefield.) Ayer is devoted to the very 70s idea that a violent film has to be about the efficacy of violence but he always comes to same relativist conclusion; his world is black and gray which isnt all that different from black and white. When it all comes down to it ""History is violent"" isnt much of a foundation for a movie--unless of course a filmmakers primary goal is to provide cheap shocks which Fury delivers in spades blown-off heads; corpses flattened into the mud; a soldier engulfed in flames shooting himself in the head; Wardaddys crew killing child soldiers and then driving down a country road strung with the corpses of civilians; men blown open by grenades; wounded soldiers yawping out Wilhelm Screams as they get crushed under the treads of a tank. Borrowing a page from his own script for Training Day Ayer confines the action to a 24-hour period during which virginal Hemingway-reading Army typist Norman (Logan Lerman) finds himself abruptly transferred into Wardaddys crew and gets to learn firsthand about what terrible people real men are. (His first task wiping his predecessors brains off the interior of the tank using a bucket of water and a rag.) Skirmish by skirmish Norman is initiated into the cult of the tank which revolves around Wardaddy and his Plexiglas-handled M1917 revolvers. Their mantra is ""Best job I ever had""; by the end of the movie one gets the sense Norman believes it but not why.One cant help but admire Ayers commitment to showing the ugliness of the most mythologized of all wars just as one cant help feeling disappointed that Ayer treats the ugliness as an end in and of itself. Seeing American soldiers execute prisoners is about as edifying as seeing a cop take bribes. At least the gore is convincing.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 511 p.m. MST October 15 2014David Ayers film despite extreme levels of gore is a resolutely traditional war film. With Brad Pitt.""Fury"" has some new gorier visual elements for a WWII film but it doesnt break the mold of traditional war movies.(Photo Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 3.5 starsPitt plays Wardaddy a tough sergeant of a tank crew.Logan Lerman is the young clerk typist suddenly thrown into battle.Ayer depicts war realistically but the characters arent fleshed out.""Fury"" is a doggedly traditional World War II film dressed up like a modern-day morality play.David Ayers movie feints toward revealing things we havent seen in this kind of movie but for the most part that winds up being limited to gore and graphic violence. That doesnt make it bad. It just makes it less than it might have been.This is somewhat surprising given a cast that likes to take chances including Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf; previously Ayer -- in films like ""Training Day"" (which he wrote) and ""End of Watch"" (which he wrote and directed) -- has too.Ayer does include some behavior from American troops that wouldnt make anybodys coffee-table book of Greatest Generation Illustrated. Yet these were desperate times with the pressure to merely survive unimaginable. So that part is a little bit different. But in terms of story structure and look (with the exception of the gore) this movie could have been made at any time in the past 70 years.Related azcentral.coms newest movie reviews | 52 Fall films to see for everyoneThe film takes place during the waning days of the war. We see a burned-out battlefield. We learn immediately that Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Pitt) acts decisively and brutally to keep the members of his tank crew alive. He has promised to do so and theyve been fighting together since Africa. Now theyre making the push into Germany and Wardaddy has broken his promise. One of his crew is dead all over the inside of the tank.When they get to a makeshift base Wardaddy reluctantly accepts a replacement Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) a clerk typist who is now a tank driver. Norman is very much the new kid on the block. The rest of the crew -- Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (LaBeouf) who is religious; Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Pena) who drinks a lot; and Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis a hick with a short fuse -- proceed to indoctrinate Norman in the ways of war or at least try to.This includes at least one war crime at the hands of Wardaddy. Or is it? His job is he says to kill Germans. Right and wrong dont matter and if Norman is gun shy it could get them all killed. How far will someone go to stay alive to keep others alive?Brad Pitt (left) as Wardaddy talks with Shia LaBeouf as Boyd ""Bible"" Swan in a scene from ""Fury."" (Photo Columbia Pictures)The answers comes quickly pretty damn far. Its a high-risk job for the tank crews; the German tanks are technically superior and better built. Wardaddy counters with those staples of war films smarts and guts.The film consists of one assignment after another with a break in between battles when the Allied forces take a German town. And then take liberties with its inhabitants specifically the women. Wardaddy has taken Norman under his wing by this point. They walk into the apartment of two women (Anamaria Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg) and while they are never physically demanding they are the walking definition of implied threat.Its unsettling. Wardaddy commands the situation telling Norman if he doesnt take the younger woman (von Rittberg) to the bedroom he will. Norman complies with the seeming consent of the woman.More Qamp;A with Logan LermanLater after Wardaddy offers the gift of real eggs and a meal is prepared the rest of the crew horns in and is considerably more coarse and threatening. But duty calls before things can get out of hand followed by an unsurprising dramatic turn taken from the pages of a weepy melodrama.The film fares better on the battlefield particularly in one scene where American tanks face off against the superior Germans. Its harrowing stuff with Ayer playing up the tension to the hilt. Here we truly see Wardaddy at his best displaying both a kind of tactical genius and unshakable nerves.The film gets its title from the tanks name painted onto its gun. But its also an obvious nod to the pitch at which these battles are fought these lives are lived. The Germans have become desperate arming women and children and hanging as cowards any who wont join in. This leads to unthinkable decisions that must be made without hesitation that will live with these men the rest of their lives.Whats missing is stronger characters. Norman is the most fully realized with the most potential for growth. The rest are archetypes perhaps meant to be as some sort of universal symbols of fighting men but never fully satisfying either way. All of the actors -- even LaBeouf who has been kind of creepy in recent films -- do good work here. Pitt brings a lot more to Wardaddy than whats in the script.Ultimately ""Fury"" is a good conventional war movie that might have become something more.AZCENTRALFury (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsFuryDirector David Ayer.Cast Brad Pitt Shia LaBeouf Logan Lerman.Rating R for strong sequences of war violence some grisly images and language throughout.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Another conventional saga about a small isolated and battered group of GIs fighting the Nazis the familiar action-packed Fury does little to suggest an independent vision but in his own sure way writer-director David Ayer does raise questions of morality in war among men who are supposed to be on the same side. It never scales the cinematic heights or reaches the same groundbreaking level as Saving Private Ryan but its intensely ferocious and relentlessly rough on the senses. Youll  know youve been to war and not on the Hollywood front. FURY  (3/4 stars) Written and directed by David Ayer Starring Brad Pitt Shia LaBeouf and Logan Lerman Running time 134 min. Set during the final days of World War II in the muddy trenches behind German lines when the allies were advancing toward Berlin and suffering staggering losses it tells the story of a small battalion of brave soldiers who lose most of their combat unit in an enemy slaughter leaving four survivors who confiscate a German tank and call it ""Fury."" Whats left of the unit is commanded by a stressed-out Sgt. Don (""Wardaddy"") Collier (Brad Pitt in a role that serves as a close kin to the killing machine he played in Inglourious Basterds minus the humor) who bears the scars of many defeats but will die before he surrenders or shows even the slightest evidence of weakness. In addition to his three hardened crew members--the cocky scripture-quoting ""Bible"" (Shia LaBeouf) the Mexican driver ""Gordo"" (Michael Pena) and the violent Cajun roughneck ""Coon Ass"" (Jon Bernthal)--Wardaddy now inherits an inexperienced kid named Norman a young desk typist who has only been in the army eight weeks and is already assigned to the front lines as an assistant driver. Norman (well played by the 22-year-old standout Logan Lerman who made his mark as the teenage George Hamilton opposite Renee Zellwegger in My One and Only when he was 17) is not only terrified to the point of vomiting at the carnage that bloodies the battlefield around him but a dedicated pacifist who refuses to kill another human being even in self-defense. What there is of a plot between violent skirmishes and explosions centers on how Norman changes from a clean-cut baby-faced innocent into a scruffy filthy cog in the rusty war machine as a first-class soldier how he learns to trust and depend on Wardaddy and how the other members of the team learn to grudgingly respect the kid too. ""Ideals are peaceful history is violent"" is the talisman Wardaddy lives by and its a brutal education for a lost boy who finds death around every corner. Even his one tender sexual encounter when he loses his virginity with a sweet German girl who is then nearly raped and murdered by his comrades ends in tragedy. After more than two hours of cussing and fighting and killing Fury culminates in a scorching finale between the outnumbered survivors inside the seriously disabled Fury and a marauding army of superior heavy-armored enemy Tiger tanks that takes the breath away. The sequence did not move me as deeply as the Normandy landing in Saving Private Ryan but nevertheless remains fixed in my memory as a powerful evocation of the horror and chaos of combat. Director Mr. Ayer who has previously concentrated on films about the L.A.P.D. carefully researched every incident in Fury establishing a tense balance between the corpses piling up under machine-gun fire and the rare moments of quiet that reflect fear homesickness and boredom among the troops. The characters are mainly war-movie stereotypes the dialogue consists of illogical sound bites (""Youre a dog--all you understand is the fist and the boot) and that overwrought macho ending where the outnumbered Americans take on what looks like the whole damned Nazi army is the closest thing in the movie to a Hollywood cliche. Still the actors are all good Mr. Pitt moves even closer to iconic stardom and young Mr. Lerman steals the picture as the camera lens through whose eyes and veins we share every dehumanizing experience.

Big ScreenMovie Reviews Rough brotherhood 1 0 God and guns. By Matthew Lickona Oct. 15 2014 Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Story alerts Letter to Editor Pin it Furys title refers to an American tank that started out WWII fighting Germans in Africa and is now pushing toward Berlin as the enemy makes its last stand. Its crew -- evangelical Shia LaBoeuf brutish Jon Bernthal pragmatic Michael Pena and lordly Brad Pitt perched above them all -- is muddy weary and suddenly saddled with newbie Logan Lerman eight weeks in the Army and delivered unto them by mistake. Except assures Bernthal the Army (like God) doesnt make mistakes. Ours is not to reason why or even to fret about right and wrong. Ours is to kill Germans and the sooner Lerman learns that the better. As Pitt puts it ""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent."" No sense complaining. Fury  Speaking of God first thing the boys ask Lerman where hes from which doesnt matter and then what he believes which does. God-talk pervades the proceedings even as the carnage cruelty and carnality threaten to swallow all. Soldiers are compared to prophets sent by the Almighty. Present loss is considered in light of the eternal reward for those who do Gods will. Folks even argue about whether God could possibly love the monstrous opposition. By the time writer-director David Ayer pulls back on his final shot perhaps the most appropriate response is ""Of course violence -- heroic or horrific depending on your point of view -- at the very center of religious belief."" Suddenly things dont feel quite so historical. Speaking of Ayer the director of End of Watch and Training Day hasnt lost his touch for depicting rough brotherhood. Sergeant Pitt loves his men but hes happy to kick their asses if need be. And while I cant recall much about End of Watchs patrol car I wont soon forget the spare metallic thingness of Furys tank nor his apparent delight in rubbing my face (and also some poor soldiers) in the reddened slime of the Greatest Generations war.

Also the mud. The grime. The blood. The darkness and the light. And the noise. Always the noise. ""Fury"" is full of noise sometimes German marching songs (which are made to sound like the Latin chants in horror movies) sometimes colorfully cursing Americans. But both are drowned out by the artillery and the screaming. Everybody is yelling in ""Fury"" and no one is listening and all you can do is push forward mile by mile sometimes block by block. The film -- written and directed by David Ayer -- looks at an interesting part of World War II The near-end of it. Its spring 1945 and the Americans are in Germany. But they still have to take it and the Germans are not going to concede one muddy inch. ""Why dont they give up?"" one grizzled American wonders. ""Would you?"" another asks. No you probably would not at least not if youre the sort of fight-to-the-last-bullet warrior that Ayer -- whos had a hand in films from ""Training Day"" to ""Sabotage"" -- likes to celebrate as symbolizing man at his best even when theyre at their worst. And the characters in ""Fury"" are a motley crew. Terse and tight-knit they have been together since the Africa campaign and they have only one objective Kill as many German soldiers as they can. Surrender? Thats a concept they dont recognize -- on either side. Brad Pitt -- still a little too movie-star handsome even with the grease and grime -- is the leader with a very good Logan Lerman as a wet-behind-the-ears soldier. They form an early father/son (or older brother/kid brother) bond and their scenes together have the most emotional heft. The rest of the cast though makes less of an impression -- an intense Michael Pena an insane Jon Bernthal (who seems to be channeling John Cassavetes from ""The Dirty Dozen"") and Shia LeBeouf as a Bible-quoting Southerner who always seems to be shedding a single tear perhaps because he just realized hes Shia LeBeouf. This shallowness may not be the actors faults. All these characters are types -- the tough Sarge the rough ""ethnic"" the kid -- and Ayers script never quite gets beyond that. It would be nice to have even a hint of what their lives were like before this hell -- like Tom Hanks mentioning in ""Saving Private Ryan"" that back home hes a teacher. But in ""Fury"" there is no home theres only here and five men in a clanking tank slowly moving forward -- until they find themselves broken down and surrounded. Thats when ""Fury"" really explodes as five men take on several hundred and the screen becomes a chaotic swirl of smoke and fire and screaming. Its a bravura action sequence of quick shots and lingering violence the kind that Ayer has always been good at even when his films -- like the James Ellroy misfire ""Dark Blue"" -- lost the thread of their drama. Yet as impressive as this extended fight is it pales next to some of the earlier moments -- Lerman finding half a mans face like a broken mask lying on the tank floor or Pitt calmly and coldly executing German prisoners. Or the two of them clinging to a brief pretense of civilian life in a momentarily quiet occupied town. Its the climax that ""Fury"" will be remembered for perhaps and the extreme action undoubtedly becomes a major part of its ad campaign -- more than two hours of pure kill-em-all warfare. But its the fog and mud and noise of war that really linger in the mind. And the flashes of crystal clarity -- kill or be killed -- that are the only things able to cut through the haze. Ratings note The film contains violence graphic gore strong language and alcohol abuse. Fury (R) Sony (135 min.) Directed by David Ayer. With Brad Pitt Shia LaBeouf.

That sounds like Im busting his chops but its not entirely a bad thing. Ayers brand of cinemacho involves no CGI space-battles or robot superheroes; he appears uniquely interested in the long-neglected category of Movies for Your Dad featuring hardboiled and morally conflicted heroes facing the final test of their moral fiber. If Ayers pictures all combine ultra-violence tough-minded realism and masculine sentimentality at least the blend is distinctive and bears little or no resemblance to the teen-oriented action fantasies that dominate Hollywood production. He wrote two of the most relentless and memorable cop movies of recent years ""Training Day"" and ""End of Watch"" (he also directed the latter) and with ""Fury"" he turns his intense focus to an even more neglected genre and to the war that became the crucible of 20th-century American manhood.Like Ayers cop flicks ""Fury"" is a gripping ride all the way through if somewhat restricted in its emotional and visual range. That fits well enough since it seeks to capture the way decent or at least ordinary men can become lost in violent tasks and lose their connection to the outside world. ""Fury"" may be too narrow in focus almost too minimalist to be remembered as a great war film. (It reminds me more than a little of the insanely claustrophobic Israeli tank film ""Lebanon."") But if you get yourself past the star power and the marketing campaign and go see it you wont soon forget it. Ayer and cinematographer Roman Vasyanov gradually ratchet up the tension as a tank crew led by hardened Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Pitt) gets trapped behind enemy lines in Germany and must face a battalion of SS troops all by themselves - and then release it in a nearly ludicrous orgy of violence with a Peckinpah-scale body count.That cartoonish conclusion while excitingly staged is a letdown in dramatic terms because up to that point Ayer handles the storys moral ambiguity with electrical precision. If Wardaddy sometimes comes off as the archetypal decent man in an indecent situation hes also a professional soldier willing to brutalize a new recruit in the interests of survival and getting the job done. Im not sure this movie or this role quite possesses the breadth necessary to win Pitt an Oscar (which is clearly one of its goals) but he gives a terrific performance offering glimpses of other levels and depths within the man that are never revealed.In the most obvious ways ""Fury"" reaches back to the rousing band-of-brothers tradition of 60s and 70s war movies like ""The Big Red One"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" but it also reflects more than a little the post-Vietnam shadow that fell across later films like ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket."" It has absolutely none of the ironic or rueful postmodern consciousness that afflicts most latter-day WWII flicks from ""Inglourious Basterds"" to ""The Monuments Men"" and even ""Saving Private Ryan."" Wardaddy and his guys dont waste any time worrying about the rightness of their cause or bellyaching about the human costs of war; theyre fighting Hitler after all. But Ayers a bit too smart to make a straightforward and uncomplicated tale of war heroism; this is more like a story that reminds you without lecturing that theres no such thing and never was. These men are severely traumatized by what theyve been through even if they dont quite have the vocabulary to express it. Once out of sight of his men after a battle the laconic Wardaddy drops to his knees to vomit. As gradually becomes all too clear the line that separates American heroes from war criminals is almost too fine to perceive. You Might Also Like Its the spring of 1945 and Allied troops are converging on Berlin from all directions. Everyone knows the war will be over within days or weeks but Wardaddys tank platoon and a few other undersupplied fragments of the U.S. Army are trying to wipe up pockets of resistance across southern Germany. His crew are a deliberately stereotypical collection of army types Shia LaBoeuf in a low-key focused performance as ""Bible"" the scripture-quoting born-again; Jon Bernthal as ""Coon-Ass"" the debauched and dangerous good ol boy; and Michael Pena as ""Gordo"" the bilingual Latino from the Southwest. Their longtime machine-gunner has been killed and it falls to a raw draftee named Ellison (Logan Lerman) who trained as a clerk-typist to clean whats left of the former gunner out of the tank and take his seat. Ellison serves as our window into the world of the war which he is eager to avoid or resist. When the other guys meet Ellison at first they start guessing where hes from as in one of those classic war films. When he starts to answer the question they tell him to shut up They dont actually give a crap. It falls to Wardaddy to break this kid condition him to killing and earn him a ""war name"" so they all have a chance to go home.Many of the so-called soldiers still fighting on the German side at this late stage are teenage boys and men over 50 and early in the movie the pickings are pretty easy. Fury -- thats the name painted on Wardaddys tank -- rolls through a succession of crossroads vehicles encountering the corpses of locals suspected of disloyalty hung from lampposts by the SS. When the Americans take a middle-sized town after a brief but intense battle they seize the spoils of war in routine fashion Whatever booze and food the retreating Germans have left behind - and the towns women with or without what we would now consider full adult consent. Wardaddy spots a penthouse apartment where two well-dressed female cousins the remnants of local society have holed up. He takes Ellison up there for a tense tender wrenching and emotionally violent scene that boils Ayers essential question into a few minutes Can the contamination of war within one person or one unit be contained and controlled? Or does it always end by corrupting everything? There was clearly more to Don Collier before he became Wardaddy but Ayer never gives us more than a few hints. Collier speaks German (a lot better than Pitts character did in ""Inglourious Basterds"") which comes in handy more than once and drops a few comments that suggest a degree of worldliness and education beyond the Texas tough-guy act. ""Ideals are peaceful"" he says to Ellison ""but history is violent."" By becoming Wardaddy he has essentially agreed to surrender to that historical logic to give up his individuality to a larger force. One can say that its pure accident that Wardaddy is fighting on the ""right"" side just as a series of accidents strands the men of Fury in their broken-down tank right in the path of one of the last surviving SS units all too eager to die for the Fatherland. Who goes home a hero who dies a martyrs death and who gets ignominiously buried in the ruins of the Thousand-Year Reich? That too is a question for history.""Fury"" opens nationwide this week.

"Review Fury a brutal visceral war story - Mercury News Hot Topics San Diego cop killed Big Sur fire Michael Parros Lake Tahoe warming Keith Urban Alphabet hiring Star Parties Facebook tax bill Brock Turner case Ask Amy SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview Fury a brutal visceral war storyBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 10/14/2014 044522 PM PDTUpdated 10/15/2014 040519 PM PDT ""Fury"" is so technically accomplished at making us feel like were in the grip of battle you nearly forgive it for its sorrowful predictability. But that could well be the point writer and director David Ayer slams home that war robs brave soldiers of innocence and that theres nothing romantic about the battlefield.No matter the feint of heart should consider themselves forewarned ""Fury"" is a nauseatingly gruesome epic from David Ayer a terrific filmmaker with a talent for movies that are muscular gory and wrenching.His reportedly 80-million ""Fury"" has little plot to speak of but its effective nevertheless as it places the audience directly in a Sherman tank where we too experience the claustrophobia of those environs and the creeping madness of war as it picks away vulturelike at the psyches of valiant soldiers.In the dimming days of WWII five men are sent on a deadly mission into their own heart of darkness in heavily occupied Nazi zones in a tank called Fury. As the films preface states American tanks were inferior to the German ones.It is April 1945 and the physically and psychically scarred Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) commands the squadron. Hes seen it all and his sanitys been worn down to its nubs. When we first meet him hes stabbing the enemy in the eye. It doesnt get any prettier. We then meet the men under ""Wardaddy"" the Christian gunner Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf) the drown-it-in-a-bottle tank driver Trini Garcia (Michael Pena) and the scrappy Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal). When the squadrons assistant driver is killed its up to fresh-faced Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) to take the wheel. But first he must literally mop up his predecessors face.Advertisement Each of these men except for Norman who is initially late on his trigger finger is exhausted from fighting this Good War. Theyre all battling demons -- some from bloody battlefields theyve left behind others they fear are lurking around the corner.There are a number of perfectly staged tank fights which reverberate with authenticity. Thats thanks to atmospheric photography overseen by Roman Vasyanov on-the-battlefield sound mixing by Lisa Pinero and roughed-up production design by Andrew Menzies. War here is soaked in realism and unsanitized by Hollywood. Its one in which we sink into the grit while jumping at the sounds of gunfire and becoming antsy at the crushing menacing silence in between shots.Besides the standout battle scenes an intense nonaction sequence midway through makes ""Fury"" more ambitious and complex. It takes place when Norman and Wardaddy enter the home of two German women and attempt to create a surreal semblance of normalcy that includes having a simple breakfast. But normal simply cant exist here.The acting is terrific. Pitt is solid as the tortured and conflicted commander. Pena who worked wonders for Ayers in the superior cop drama ""End of Watch"" continues to show range. Lerman of ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" lands the best part and deftly shows the evolution of a soldier in battle. Bernthal (""The Walking Dead"") makes tightly wound convincing. Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) with soldiers in Fury. (Giles Keyte/Sony Pictures) ( Giles Keyte ) But it is LaBeouf whos most impressive inhabiting the soul of a scripture-quoting soldier who seeks guidance from the Word in hopes of remaining on a moral path. While much has been made about the reportedly extreme lengths he took to prep for the role the fact remains it is one of his best performances.The potent religious subtext that LaBeoufs character introduces is thoughtfully invoked throughout ""Fury"" culminating in a stunning visual image in its finale. In preparation for ""Fury"" Ayer interviewed veterans so he could accurately tap into their beliefs and experiences. He also sought realism from his cast by putting his actors through a variation of boot camp.It all pays off. While Ayers ""Fury"" does mine a well-worn genre it is texturally different in how vigorously and viscerally it laces us into tired brave soldiers muck-stained boots. fury    Rating R (for strong sequences of war violence some grisly images and language throughout) Cast Brad Pitt Logan Lerman Shia LaBeouf Michael Pena Jon BernthalDirector and writer David Ayer Running time 2 hours 15 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Entertainment Brad Pitts War Movie ""Fury"" Is A Manly Tearjeaker Weepies dont always look like The Notebook. David Ayers impressive WWII drama is a brutal battle epic with a teary emotional core. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Brad Pitt Shia LaBeouf Logan Lerman Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal in Fury. CTMG/Sony Pictures Entertainment ID 4014097 The first job given to Norman Ellison the fresh-faced new Army recruit played by Logan Lerman in the World War II drama Fury is to clean the remains of his predecessor out of the tank to which hes been assigned. The bodys already been carted away but theres splattered viscera against one of the walls to be mopped up blood to be wiped away. And then horribly Ellison finds an unmistakable chunk of the dead guys face a sight that causes him to clamber outside and throw up in front of his indifferent colleagues. Fury which is written and directed by David Ayer (End of Watch Sabotage) and opens in theaters on Oct. 17 is peppered with merciless moments like that. Like Saving Private Ryan its a World War II movie filled with urgency to get out from under the prettier images of heroism and valor conjured by the idea of American troops in that conflict. Its set in a ravaged 1945 Germany that frequently looks like it might be hell and the conflict it portrays is all about flesh from the soldier who covered in flames shoots himself to end his pain to the smashed remnants of a corpse in the mud that the tanks roll all over like roadkill. Its a war-in-hell story about the four veterans and one newcomer manning a Sherman tank called ""Fury"" but its also about the depths of the relationships theyve built with one another in the midst of combat. And in that way its also another type of movie -- the kind Ive always thought of as ""the male weepie."" Weepies as in movies that are intended to make you cry neednt be gendered. But they tend to be thought of as being for women -- like Terms of Endearment Titantic The Notebook The Fault In Our Stars films that created instant sisterhoods of shared Kleenex packets in the dark of theaters around the world. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerrs An Affair to Remember one of the grand dames of the genre was part of a running bit in Sleepless in Seattle -- no female character could describe the plot without sobbing but for the men it was talking about war epic The Dirty Dozen that got the tears flowing. ID 3999554 Giles Keyte CTMG/Sony Pictures Entertainment CTMG/Sony Pictures Entertainment Giles Keyte CTMG/Sony Pictures Entertainment ID 4014164 That scenes played as a joke and a good one but Sleepless in Seattle was also on to something -- there is a subset of movies that are just as deliberately crytastic by way of gruff masculine stories. Sometimes theyre about sports or daddy issues or both -- see Field of Dreams -- and other times they hide their tears behind formidable violence like the terrific MMA sibling drama Warrior or the matched macho historical pairing of Gladiator and Braveheart. These are Serious Topics and so these movies dont get described in the same way someone might dismissively talk of Beaches but they can be just as emotionally indulgent in their depictions of bonding and sacrifice. Just because a movie has a battle scene doesnt mean its not a weepie at heart and for the record Fury has two massive ones -- the first a thrillingly tense tank fight out on a field the second a prolonged barrage at a crossroads where Fury has stalled out. The second battle is Furys big setpiece an escalating sequence of shock and slaughter but by the time it arrives its a bit of a letdown because the films true interest and impact isnt in the combat but in the characters and how war and trauma has bound these men together. Theres Ellison green unprepared initially reluctant to kill. Then theres Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (Walking Dead alum Jon Bernthal) a weaselly unpredictable guy from Arkansas; the boisterous Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Pena); and the devout Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (Shia LaBeouf) whos settled on an unstable balance between religion and war. Commanding them is U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) a man deliberately shorn of identifying details from before the war. Hes seemingly unflappable and tough as nails; he speaks German and sports an undercut thats both period-appropriate and the height of current fashion. As his name indicates he treats his men with a paternal ease that sometimes means comforting them and other times putting a gun in their hands and forcing them to kill an unarmed German. When we see a hint of vulnerability from him its one he hides from his men a quick panic attack he gasps out when no one can see him. ID 4014128 View this image > Giles Keyte CTMG/Sony Pictures Entertainment ID 4014190 How men behave under prolonged stress is an interest of Ayers from his debut with the Christian Bale and Freddy Rodriguez bromance-gone-wrong Harsh Times to Jake Gyllenhaal and Penas intriguing found footage-y cop drama End of Watch a movie I like more as time goes by. The people these Fury four have already become and the person Ellison turns into over the course of the film have been reforged and hardened by bloodshed. Theyve surrendered to the mindset needed to see the things they see and do the things they do but theyve done it together. Its a sort of mutual insanity -- their sometimes ironic and sometimes absolutely sincere refrain is ""Best job I ever had"" Between the barrages of gun and cannon fire heavy enough to look like laser salvos they indulge in arguments theyve had before Collier teasing Swan over whether or not Hitler is saved while Garcia goads the callow Ellison by telling him the girl hes admiring will sleep with him for a chocolate bar. Fury which is Ayers best work to date is a better movie for its tender teary interior for its unspoken affirmations of how much its soldiers actually love each other. Pitt may be the movie star and may know how good he looks in silhouette firing a tank gun but its the very good LaBeouf watery-eyed and sad whos a more accurate embodiment of the films sentiments. For all its ferocious combat sequences and creative carnage the stand-out sequence involves no fighting at all. Its a quieter interlude when Collier leads Ellison to an upscale apartment in a town theyve just taken over where he orders the women inside (Anamaria Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg) to make them breakfast. Collier and Ellison coax the women into letting their guard down and settle in for a breather a simulacrum of civilization thats abruptly disrupted by the arrival of Garcia Swan and Travis who are all pissed about being left out. The specter of violence of rape hangs over the interrupted meal though their anger seems less aimed at the ""playing house"" with German ladies and more at the breaking of an unspoken contract -- they were all supposed to be in this together not softening not coddling not pretending for even a second that life is back to normal. Swan stares at Collier like a betrayed lover while the others unspool a disturbing story from the teams recent past like theyre opening a window to let the outside ugliness spill back in. The only softness allowed is apparently whatever they can spare for one another and the scenes where it shows are genuinely heartrending even in the midst of anti-tank fire. Fury may bristle with testosterone but its a tearjerker nonetheless and a good one a story about men trudging to the end of the world together.

Writer-director David Ayers ""Fury"" a film about tank warfare in the waning days of World War II does not flinch or fuss when it comes to showing the blood gore and gristle of modern armed conflict. But at the same time by doing so it attains a savage grace that turns its brutality into a kind of truth as hulking metal juggernauts crush across the landscape spitting fire and death with fragile mortal flesh-and-blood men inside. This isnt disposable popcorn entertainment or a winking ""war"" film like ""Inglourious Basterds."" Ayers aim here is a film that will stick and stick with you. And he achieves it. Beginning in April 1945 and with a title explaining that the German tank corps had far superior armor and arms than the tanks of their American opposition ""Fury"" takes its name from the Sherman tank under the leadership of Sgt. Don Collier (Brad Pitt who also produced). Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf) is the pious and positive main gunner; Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) is Swans coarse loader and ad-hoc engineer. Trini Garcia (Michael Pena a prior Ayer collaborator) is the wine-thirsty driver. Also read Brad Pitt Thinks Shia LaBeouf Is One of the Best Actors Hes Ever Seen And their assistant driver is dead to be replaced by transferred clerk Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) pulled from the clerks pool and put in the assistant drivers seat with his fingers on the trigger of a machine gun. Ellison hasnt been to tank school -- ""Im trained to type 60 words a minute"" -- and one of his first tasks upon joining Furys crew is to get whats left of his predecessor out of the inside with a bucket of cold water and a rag. His education under Sgt. Collier will turn a near-civilian into a survivor and at no small cost. Writer-director Ayer usually sticks close to the mean streets of L.A. (""End of Watch"" ""Street Kings"") but the change here serves him well. Its not just that ""Fury"" has terrific action sequences with real World War II-era tanks in operation on-screen (which it does). Its also that ""Fury"" is in no small part about the moral and ethical consequences of war what it takes to kill what it takes to survive what it takes to do the job of murder as ordered to in the name of your nation. Even with its speaker-rattling and stunningly shot action ""Fury"" contains moments of something like beauty. An all-too-brief interlude Collier and Elliott spend with two German women (Anamaria Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg) is an oasis of civility and civilian life -- fresh eggs a close shave a man and a woman alone for a moment -- interrupted by the drunk coarse remainder of the crew. Bernthal specifically embodies one of the films central ideas namely as Dr. Johnson said how ""he who makes himself a beast rids himself of the pain of being a man."" All of Colliers crew have to become beasts because to be a mere man at the ugly end of an ugly war would be intolerable. Also read Brad Pitt Tries to Teach Logan Lerman The Brutal Reality of War in Fury Clip (Video) The performances are excellent even if Ayers film is far more of a tour-de-force with the emphasis on force about the mechanics and morality of war than it is about its characters. You get the sense of real combat here the vast and mighty enterprise of it alongside the futile and doomed waste. Pitt as Collier is a standout -- not only for his work as Collier but the fact he was willing to play the part at all; Pitt has always been an actor trapped in a movie stars face and life and his willingness to shun likeability is a badge of honor. Production designer Andrew Menzies is to credit for much of the films claustrophobic look and feel recreating the inside of a Sherman tank for the scenes of war and work and worry among the crew while also painting the larger canvas of a battle-ruined Germany. Cinematographer Roman Vasyanov (""The East"" ""End of Watch"") does a surprisingly vivid job with a film that mostly takes place in rivers of muck blood and mud. Ayer is also a veteran of the U.S. Navy having served aboard submarines and while subs and tanks seem not at all alike the sense of close-quarters working and living with one ear always listening for the killing shot thats aimed at you informs the film significantly. Youre in this film nestled close from the start right up to its brutal finale as the men of Furys crew have to hold off a massive force of German troops alone weary Spartans with a dirt crossroads as their Thermopylae. Also read Jon Bernthal Reveals Why Fury Director David Ayer Punched Him in the Face (Video) Ayers ""Fury"" is unrelenting; at the same time it inspires thoughts of everything from Sam Fullers jut-jawed war films to the blunt truth of Randall Jarrells 1945 poem ""The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner."" In 1971 Vietnam veteran (later Secretary of State) John Kerry posed the questions testifying before the U.S. Senate ""How do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?"" ""Fury"" wonders with purpose and power how you can even ask someone to be the last person to die for a ""good"" war? Unflinching unsentimental and never unconsidered ""Fury""s rumbling metal-clad exterior has real humanity fragile and frightened captured and caged deep within it. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Its Germany April 1945. The battles have all been won; the war is almost over. But Hitler refuses to surrender so the Allies make a final push taking the nation one town at a time. Pitt is tank commander Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier a growling bull whose men hero-worship him like hes the Second Coming. Theyre not alone The camera adores Pitts battered beauty filming him like an Adonis chiseled by a Renaissance sculptor then left on a cliff edge to be pecked by gulls for a few hundred years. Fury strains to be a Great Film but never quite gets there. After his assistant driver is killed in battle Wardaddy is assigned wet-behind-the-ears Norman (Logan Lerman) a typist whos never been inside a tank. His first job is to clean his predecessors blood and face bits off the seat before Wardaddy takes him in like an overbearing father ""Youre no good to me if you cant kill Krauts."" We havent seen Pitt this switched on in years--his Wardaddy is 110 percent testosterone. Parachute him into a peacenik march and hed have the majority of them signed up for active duty in 30 minutes flat. The battle scenes thunder and rage with a satisfyingly unadorned realism. Everything is covered in mud and theres plenty of authentically sweaty male bonding in the tank the name of which gives the film its title. In places director David Ayer (End of Watch) goes for the hallucinatory horrors of the great Russian war film Come and See as bodies pile up in heaps of limbs. Ordinary Germans bombed out of their homes tramp across the countryside like zombies one woman still in her ripped wedding dress. If Saving Private Ryan was about the goodness that survives during conflict the message here is darker War pulverizes a benign spirit like corpses crushed under the caterpillar tracks of tanks. In a stomach-knotting scene in a defeated village Wardaddy takes Norman into an apartment where two young women cook them lunch. Its a breath of fresh air allowing a little civilization to re-emerge--until the rest of the tank crew storms in bitter and jealous. War brutalizes men and thats part of its lure. But then Fury remembers its a film starring Brad Pitt one that requires heroism and it grinds to a punch-pulling Hollywood ending.

Daily Edition Login to download Fury Film Review 1000 AM PDT 10/10/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Brad Pitt dominates in this rugged and realistic World War II drama TWITTER David Ayers World War II drama stars Brad Pitt as a tough sergeant leading a unit through Nazi Germany Fury is a good solid World War II movie nothing more and nothing less. Rugged macho violent and with a story sufficiently unusual to grab and hold interest its a modern version of the sort of movie Hollywood turned out practically every week back in the 1940s and 1950s. Today and because it stars Brad Pitt in what deserves to stand as an emblematic performance it seems like a bigger deal and the films mild case of pretentiousness in the climactic stretch is its one notable problem. Whether women flock to see Pitt playing a brutal war-hardened but wise soldier is a question but guys will have no trouble jumping on board for this rough ride through the final phase of the war which augurs a solid box-office run through the fall for this Sony release. A Navy man himself writer-director David Ayer smartly moves away from the feverish cop and urban crime dramas hes written and sometimes directed (Training Day S.W.A.T. Dark Blue Harsh Times Street Kings End of Watch) to channel his dramatic ferocity into a story of the Allies final ground assault on the Third Reich. Its a combat unit yarn centered on a group of five led by Pitts Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier a tank commander with the 2nd Armored Division whos seen it all from Africa to Belgium and the Netherlands and now in April 1945 deep into Germany where although faced with certain defeat the Nazis intend to fight to the last. Coiffed in a striking cut with the sides shaved close but the top more luxuriant -- almost WWI Prussian style -- Wardaddy is a hard man and proves it in the way he breaks in newcomer Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) a green kid trained as a typist whos abruptly thrown into a tank for the first time as the assistant driver. As a rite of passage Wardaddy forces Norman to shoot a captured SS officer and this will hardly be the only thing he does for the first time during the 24 hours the story encompasses from dawn to dawn. The other guys aboard ""Fury"" the nickname thats painted on the gun barrel of their M4 Sherman tank are gunner Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf) a fierce warrior but also a religious and thoughtful man; his loader Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) a scruffy belligerent hillbilly of the first order; and driver Trini Garcia (Michael Pena) an alert Mexican-American with a taste for the bottle. To his credit Ayer has written these men as something a bit more than types especially Boyd a role in which LaBeouf is actually appealing and strong onscreen for the first time in ages. Maybe the army discipline was good for him. After the Yanks secure a town theres time for momentary Ramp;R. Wardaddy who speaks fluent German takes the benumbed Norman under his wing and happens upon a nice apartment occupied by a mother (Anamaria Marinca) and her lovely teenage daughter Emma (Alicia von Rittberg). Naturally terrified the women are tentatively put at their ease by Wardaddy who offers them some food. What seems at first destined to be a brief encounter becomes extended into something resembling a complex one-act play simmering with innuendo uncertain agendas latent danger sexual desire mortal fear and -- when the other men particularly the uncontrollable animal Grady join the party -- disruptive violence. In the end its a poignant and tragic interlude the best passage in the film one that addresses the damage -- psychological emotional and physical -- that war causes beyond the immediate casualties of battle. Its qualities also cast a shadow on the remainder of the film which is occupied by a quasi-suicidal mission that Wardaddy is ordered to undertake by a captain (Jason Isaacs sporting a thick New Yawk accent). The command is issued so quickly that its not really clear why its so important for Fury and three other tanks to rush behind enemy lines; the Americans know theyre going to win so the puzzlement over the reason for sending men into such peril at this stage impedes ones investment in the climactic action. Its this part of the drama that most closely resembles Samuel Maozs 2009 Israeli film Lebanon which detailed what its like for men to occupy a fetid claustrophobic metal vault on wheels while being bombarded by hard-to-see foes. But plunking Wardaddy and his men down in such an impossible position doesnt feel right dramatically and the sergeants stoic reaction while perhaps philosophically apt for the circumstances introduces a note of windy grandiosity that mildly rubs the wrong way against everything thats come before. But even if his character is denied an entirely satisfying send-off Pitt is terrific here as a seasoned pro whos tough because the war has made him so but clearly has a lot going on inside; there can be no doubt hes committed acts he regrets. As a brave bold fighter and a thinking soldier to boot hes exactly the kind of man you want on your side in a tight spot and whom youd willingly follow into battle. As the greenhorn thrown into the deep end of war Lerman (The Perks of Being a Wallflower Noah) serves as a sympathetic viewer proxy who even in one day receives rich schooling from Wardaddy. The other men register solidly and it would be difficult not to be touched by the girl played so nicely by von Rittberg (who played the teenage Romy Schneider in a recent German TV movie) who is pushed to a full range of emotional extremes in one afternoon. Shot on film on English locations Fury has an attractively muted look that strongly reflects the weather time of day and immediate circumstances; eschewing the handheld documentary look he employed with Ayer on End of Watch cinematographer Roman Vasyanov goes the other way here with what one might call a look of rugged refinement. The tanks uniforms equipment and sets all contribute to a vivid sense of realism.

Some feats are unforgettable We remember the Alamo along with the 300 Spartans who died at Thermopylae. But a five-man American tank crew (actually four men and a baby to be more accurate) overwhelmed by a platoon of German soldiers? Not only did the standoff depicted in ""Fury"" never happen but it will likely be long gone from moviegoers memories six months from now after Sonys marketing blows over and people go back to watching ""Inglourious Basterds"" -- the other better pulp World War II movie featuring Brad Pitt as a heavily scarred slow-drawling Nazi hunter. With a disappointing domestic reception ahead David Ayers first big-studio foray as director will rely on a strong showing overseas where its fantasy of American exceptionalism will seem all the more egregious. Until now writer-director Ayer has largely focused his attention on gritty LAPD dramas Tasering the genre back to life with such tell-it-like-it-is pics as ""Training Day"" and ""End of Watch."" Set during the waning days of World War II as the Allies advance on Berlin and the Nazis put up vicious resistance on their home turf ""Fury"" shifts the directors focus to military history. As such the project marks a massive step forward in both ambition and scale for Ayer but also brings disappointment. Though colorfully embellished with authentic detail and logistically complex to bring to the screen Ayers script is bland at the most basic story level undermined by cardboard characterizations and a stirring yet transparently silly climactic showdown. Even so the film benefits from the scribes usual research-based approach to capturing the tight honor-bound dynamic of serving on the front lines enriched by his ear for precise (and period-appropriate) technical patter. The pressure-cooker atmosphere is enhanced by the fact that Pitts character Sgt. Don Collier (a diluted version of his Lt. Aldo Raine from ""Basterds"") and his men are sardined into a Sherman tank in which theyve been serving side by side since North Africa. They all have nicknames (Colliers is ""Wardaddy"") as does the tank itself ""FURY"" menacingly painted in all caps on its 76mm cannon barrel. Its a marvel of military service how men who might despise one another in civilian life can become like brothers in the field and here we get a sense of both the off-color squabbling and the deep-rooted camaraderie among these virtual siblings. Wardaddys team includes the Scripture-quoting ""Bible"" (Shia LaBeouf) Latino driver ""Gordo"" (Michael Pena affecting an early-century Mexican accent) and barely evolved swamp-rat mechanic ""Coon-Ass"" (Jon Bernthal). Ayer introduces the team from within the tight confines of their tank a space that doesnt yield many good angles but allows for some nifty lighting tricks. D.p. Roman Vasyanovs favorite is clearly to frame just the actors eyes through the narrow slits of the tanks armor. These guys look and sound like theyve been to hell and back (even pretty-boy LaBeouf who appears with his face scruffy and teeth blacked out for the role). But dont let the constant stream of personal off-color insults fool you. Their views may differ but they can agree on one thing ""Best job I ever had"" they exclaim and Ayer clearly believes it. Thats not necessarily the case for baby-faced newcomer Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) a clean-shaven wet-behind-the-ears Army typist assigned to join them at the outset -- more for reasons of dramatic convenience than practical necessity. Norman serves as the audiences proxy allowing Ayer to show us the ropes as the kid is forced into a situation more intense than hes ready to handle Norman retches after discovering the scalp of a German soldier while scrubbing the blood from his seat in the tank. As war-movie cliches go the onscreen spew is off-putting yet effective (Tom Hanks did it when he landed on Normandy Beach in ""Saving Private Ryan"") the tough-guy equivalent of watching a neophyte take his first smoke onscreen. The poster boy for S.L.A. Marshalls infamous statistic estimated in his book ""Men Against Fire"" that 75% of American troops in World War II never pulled the trigger for the purpose of killing Norman has serious reservations about handling the machine gun hes assigned. But he grows up fast as tough-love Wardaddy treats the kid like his own ""war son."" Its either that or risk letting the incompetent new team member get everyone in the crew killed which is just the over-simplistic dynamic Ayer exploits for the remainder of the film. Theres even a poignant if somewhat protracted interlude featuring ""4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days"" star Anamaria Marinca and younger beauty Alicia von Rittberg (""Barbara"") in which Pitts character enables the incredulous Norman to lose his virginity ""Shes a good clean girl. If you dont take her in that bedroom I will."" It was cigar-chomping World War II vet Samuel Fuller who practiced the philosophy that the first shot and last shot of each of his films was the most important. The same could be true of ""Fury"" which opens and closes with corpse-strewn battlefields which bookend the film with haunting evidence of the aftermath of war. Generally speaking ""Fury"" looks less like recent war movies -- with their modern handheld camerawork and overall emphasis on immersion -- than the more classically framed studio pics of an earlier era where careful attention has been paid to meticulous compositions. The same goes for Steven Prices score which offers variations on a single three-note motif poignant when appropriate but also easily expandable into a full-blown military theme as needed. Though its the action scenes that thrill Ayer makes a point of balancing them with the quiet stretches between skirmishes acknowledging that boredom -- punctuated by a certain giddy tension -- characterized much of the time soldiers spent at war. One could seldom anticipate when or where the enemy might strike but when they did the transformation from safety to survival mode was instant and entire. That makes for several heart-clutching sequences including one that narrows Wardaddys tank column down to just one as they face off against a superior German Tiger tank using the Furys speed and agility to defeat their armor-piercing rival. (The production shot with actual Sherman and Tiger tanks from World War II along with a reconstructed interior whose removable walls did little to diminish the claustrophobia of the tight space.) In another standoff the tank column advances on a treeline at dusk. The scene looks like something out of ""Star Wars"" as the opposing sides exchange what looks like green and red laser fire though the appearance and sound are both true to Ayers research The glowing bullet trails are tracers which allowed gunners to see where they were shooting -- or not in the case of the trigger-shy Norman. As in ""End of Watch"" (in which one character miraculously recovers from a near-fatal shooting) Ayer allows himself to play God here deciding the fates of his characters for emotional and dramatic impact even if none should logically survive the assault. Would a team of five men with a half-disabled tank really dig in their heels and fight a platoon of Germans nearly 300 strong? This choice is the most ""Hollywood"" element in a film that is constantly shifting between disturbing realistic details (a burning man who shoots himself to escape the pain or the German ""cowards"" hanged by the SS from street poles) and the stilted sometimes even hammy liberties needed to make its point. Ayers seemingly contradictory approach can be heard in nearly every line On one hand he goes out of his way to capture authentic-sounding slang encouraging the actors to use accents that arent always intelligible amid the hyper-attuned (and occasionally deafening) sound mix. On the other there can be no mistake that this is dialogue not natural speech for they express themselves in terse trailer-quotable soundbites that tend to remind us that were dealing with a collection of stereotypes of which Bernthals redneck is the least convincing though none ever seems more than skin-deep. If their sacrifice is meant to be memorable we must first believe them to be men Ironically its the baby of the group Norman who emerges ""Furys"" most full-fledged character.

TERRY THOMPSON says April 30 2016 at 117 pm I disagree with the review. I thought it was much better than inglorious bastards. Its one of my favorite movies and I have watched it five times so far. The acting of the cast was great. So thumbs up great movie Reply David Bobby says March 11 2016 at 934 pm I have watched this film Fury at least 30 times. I think it is brilliant. and realistic. I dont care if it never actually happened - plenty of other similar things did. that these men had underpowered and underarmored and outgunned shermans is amazing what they did. I cannot tank you people enough who made this film. all the main actors are wonderful and swamp rat played his part just fine. Brad Pitt is great in this as he was in Troy. I love the score and haunting background sounds. that we had and have such men as this to do our countries bidding is amazing. I love this film. this reviewer is off. the partial face inside the tank that norman has to clean up is a remnant of the bow gunner who was killed and who norman replaces. congrats to Pitt and Ayers. Reply Larry says August 1 2015 at 408 pm Obviously from your comments and observations you have never been been in combat nor have you served in a close knitted military unit. Your total lack of understanding of the situations and dynamics of combat are apparent from the onset if your review. With all due respect do your research before you pass observations on something you know nothing about. You just embarrass yourself.... Reply Denise Hardeman says January 27 2015 at 330 pm I so hoped to view this film on the ""big screen"" but was out of the country during its tenure. This is one of Pitts most brilliant performances as a now "" matured aged actor"". His portrayal of Collins shows that the men who battled during World War 1 amp; 2 returned home didnt complain. Sure they suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder but the brave men of that era returned home found productive jobs in order to support their families although the ""memories sights amp; sounds"" from the battle ground were kept strongly silent NOT as those who fought for the US in Iraq amp; Afghanistan...who proudly proclaim PTSD as a reason to ""cave"" expecting that tax dollars financially support their families because of the horrors of war. Certainly the military soldiers will forever ""hear amp; see"" memories of battle but I believe way to many arrive home expecting tax dollars to be freely given out (except those of who were maimed amp; physically handicapped for the remainder of their lives). I believe ALL Americans should remember amp; show great thanks to the men who served in said wars returning home amp; not complaining but mustered the strength to continue to be productive citizens of the USA. I believe PTSD is a very easily ""gained method of financial support"" as it appears the men of old wars proved it was possible to witness the most vile amp; evil sites of war amp; continue to have the character to continuing to be productive citizens of the USA. Great film for Vets amp; us...the folks that did NOT serve their country but of whom are so greatful to those that have done so. Reply pablo says January 27 2015 at 157 am The Germans who have seen the film must be dying of laughter. nothing credible pure propaganda of the American hero Reply Michael chesler says January 25 2015 at 1051 am Just read the silly critique by Mr. Debruge.....I am a rea estate developer in the Midwest but like movies and studied literature In college......I thought the director work hard to tell a small story about a small moment in a big war....clearly he took a risks with the actors and screenplay....I will bet Mr. Debruges sum total of real work risk taking is thst of a walk after dark...this critic is condescending and his words are replete with sadness from a failed life. Reply Dale says January 3 2015 at 1254 pm Your entire review lacked knowledge of the subject being reviewed and showed that you either have no idea what you are talking about or you are incredibly bias and just dont like or understand war movies.........platoon 0f 300 strong ? Really? German scalp? Not at all it was an Americans face. While the third act of the movie may seem a bit cheesy the idea of it is not at all Hollywood  there are countless stories of tank crews and even single men ( Audy Murphy ) holding off huge numbers of enemy soldigers. MANY MEN ON ALL SIDES OF THE WAR WERE ORDERD TO HOLD SOMETHING TO THE LAST MAN ON MANY OCCASIONS. If they did not stay and defend that crossroad the Germans would have been at the base of 3000 doctors cooks and mechanics in hours  pay attention if you are gonna write reviews. WHAT WAS HOLLYWOOD is the way the fight unfolds though it is very difficult to show actual battle tactics in movies cuz it does not turn out well for the screen. JON BERNTHAL was great in his role  Shia LAbeouf amazing .Everyone else good . You dont what your doing as a critic Reply PvtFstClass says December 11 2014 at 709 am It made American soldiers look more like Nazis. Reply Dale says January 3 2015 at 121 pm How so ? Did they murder there own people? Or kill 6 million Jews?or execute children and old men? They executed ss soldigers  this is very real  it did happen.they taunted a ss prisoner  this was also common.unfortunatly the us like every other country had a spoils of war doctrine meaning when we go in there take what you want as long as you do your job .it todays wars that is not ok cuz its a different scenario all together back then it was ok as it should have been. Reply Keith lee says November 15 2014 at 903 am unfortunately the critic was not there I was. He doesnt know or understand what was going on This movie brought back tearful memories as i watched my countrymen die I may forget to put milk back in icebox but this movie made me appreciate what we fought for even tho the French today have forgotten. Reply Love Movies says November 8 2014 at 1239 pm I couldnt believe that a commander (Pitt) would allow himself and his troops to commit suicide for some subjective reasoning not part of any larger plan... and then decide to all drink whisky instead of make a prepare for the fight. The moment the crew leaves the tank to get more ammo is stupid hollywood at its worst wouldnt they have noticed they didnt have the ammo inside the tank?? If the film was trying to be comic this would be ok but Fury seems to attempt these greater social commentary aspects while keeping a Die Hard action status and I kinda mostly totally wanted to blow chunks by the end. Reply Dillinger23 says December 7 2014 at 1227 pm Thanks for the myriad spoilers not having seen the film yet. Well done you. Reply Dale says January 3 2015 at 102 pm It was not subjective reasoning if he did not stay and defend that crossroad the Germans would have been at a lightly defended supply base/ aid station in a matter of hours  they could have crippled the whole company.pay attention to the movie. history show that nearly all soldigers make that same choice in that position and dont forget his orders were to hold that crossroad They did prepare  hours had gone by by the time they needed to get more ammo the quarters are tight they cannot fit all the ammo the third act is cheesy but only in its execution not its plausability Chuck says October 31 2014 at 446 pm Shows how little attention you were paying to the storyline. the face Norman cleans out of the tank is the crewman who was killed not some Kraut Only real inaccuracy was the SS trooper sparing Norman when he spotted him under the tank. And yes by wars end US troops routinely shot down SS troopers on sight. Why you say? Look up the Malmedy massacre Reply ITTTY IT says October 31 2014 at 525 am WHY is franchise slum Hollywood continuing to ------------mysteriosouly overlook-------------- some 5 decades of milestone anniversaries for the ----------------KOREAN WAR?---------------- WHY are we STILL looking at GQ World War II? Reply Ted Cardy says October 30 2014 at 518 am My wife and i really enjoyed the film  and there seems to be a difference opinion what tank it was a Sherman or a Grant in the reviews i have readi am not a Pitt fan but i went to be entertainedand from what i can remember it was not a german soldiers scalp in was an american tank soldiers face. Reply fredcehak says October 28 2014 at 355 pm While a good depiction of wars brutality  inhumanity blah blah  it had the same disappointing comic book aspects as Saving private Ryan . All the great attention to detail was spoilt by some laughable action scenes where the enemy run around in the open and forget to shoot back. This was understandable in post-war movies and Im sure audiences are expecting better than Captain America. This is a timely morale boosting flick  dwelling on a time when the enemy was clearly defined and you could win by throwing enough hardware at them. Reply richard says October 25 2014 at 649 am I dont know what movie Debruge attended. The opening numbers were great and I saw it yesterday and can unequivocally say that it is a great WWII film with a brilliant performance by Brad Pitt as a ""John Wayne"" type who show the audience the dehumanizing effect of war on the soldiers as they learn to love killing. Yes we all can have our critical points Was the film too gory and unrealistic based on that Does the final Custers Last Stand make the film believable at all??? But in the end does the film give you an insight into something you can ever imagine being inside an inferior US M4 tank in Germany at the end of the war when everyone knew the was over yet out of military necessity with the unrelenting Nazi driven army these US soldiers had to continue killing and causing mayhem these small German towns as everyone was moving on Berlin. I am sorry Mr. Debruge but I believe you are way off on this one. Reply Jeango says October 21 2014 at 1118 am I trust myself to be a critic and my critical self loved this movie. My father fought in WWII and I grew up with countless war movies. While I knew about tanks I dont recall a movie that brought you so vividly inside a warring tank. War is ugly and much of this film is ugly. Besides the blood guts mud and amo there is the psychological journey of the tank crew - how they found what they needed to survive as individuals and then to become part of a trusted team and what happens when the new man comes in. We dont know about Wardaddys scarred back why is Bible so radical Coon so beastial and Norman so pale. Why these men and why the chosen replacement? I like a film that keeps me thinking and this one does. A must see. I will go so far as to suggest a nod to the Oscars for the film and actors. Reply alex says October 20 2014 at 312 pm If you didnt sound so snobby and conceded I wouldnt care to post this but your wrong in so many places that you attitude adds to it. One was shia labouf didnt black his teeth out. He angered the whole cast by pulling his took out on set. Also many tankers made last stands like this. Reply Paul says October 20 2014 at 1227 pm Mr Debrugge. You are very wrong Sir. The final scene you saw while not strictly factual is based on one of the greatest acts of individual courage ever displayed in the Second World War. Do your research and read Belton Coopers classic novel ""Death Traps."" I assure you Sir these heroic stands were very common. One of my high school teachers had three Shermans destroyed from under him. Reply Eric says October 20 2014 at 911 am In the unlikely and amazing military accomplishments department remember that Sergeant Alvin York killed something like 28 Germans and took about 140 prisoner by himself during one engagement in WW I. Reply Brooke Bortell says October 20 2014 at 903 am My bosss father was part of a tank crew in WWII and apparently he endured a very similar situation. Never happened? Perhaps we should not make assumptions about things we do not know...history books only tell us so much Reply Jim Chorazy says October 20 2014 at 1232 am Why guess at military group sizes? A platoon is approximately 40 soldiers -- so 300 soldiers is obviously something other than platoon-sized. Reply Roy Beers says October 25 2014 at 407 pm Indeed - more like an understrength battalion. Reply Jon Cohen (JonUPS_) says October 19 2014 at 627 pm I do have to agree with more than a few other posters here-the writer the author of this criticism should have done some more real research on WWII prior to making more than a few of his comments rather than relying on what he thought happened in WWII and what he thought happened in the movie. Heck just watching Patton 360 or Great Tank Battles would have given one a better idea what happened and what was going on in movie. Reply Machine says October 19 2014 at 543 pm Criticism is supposed to be better written researched and informed than mere opinion right? Is that what a critic does? This one seems to have cut a lot of corners on this review. Very lazy and sloppily covered. The only ""scalp"" well see is this review being hung on Ayers wall after this film banks major profits and lands multiple well earned awards on its way to becoming a cult favorite. Pitt may even get an Oscar nomination. Great film even with the Hollywood ending. This review was a totally misfire. Reply Michael says October 19 2014 at 814 am I dont think that was a German ""scalp"" inside that U.S. tank. Now that would have been something He was obviously cleaning up his predecessor. And has anyone heard of a ""scalp"" with an eye in it? As for realism amazing how intact the bodies inside the tank were after two hand grenade explosions in that confined space. Or that Pitt could carry on after taking three high caliber rounds from a sniper. Come on Reply alex says October 20 2014 at 317 pm High caliber rounds tend to be able to go through the body. It would have been a clean shot through. Yes painful and would lead tp death but not instant by any means sir. Reply Dale says January 3 2015 at 108 pm This happens alot actually  ( rounds penetrating through and through and not hitting vital organs ) the 7.92 German was slightly larger then the us 7.62 but it did not have near the same energy.there is a story in a book called shooter real life sniper hits a Iraqi soldgiers twice in the chest and the lived and was totally aware and able to communicate Robert says October 19 2014 at 708 am I have to admit the reviewer didnt seem to pay enough attention to the movie some huge mistakes in his retelling of the story. I also have to admit that I really really wanted this to be a great movie I felt let down... The look of the film was great the sound was a little loud at times. The acting was fine for the most part. The problem was we have seen all of it before. How many war movies have you seen in the past that didnt have these same characters? The religious guy the mean stupid guy the new guy and of course the ""war worn"" hard solder guy? (the ranks change but the character doesnt) We even throw in the inexperienced clean cut and clean uniform officer from the Vietnam era of movies. Even my wife who hates war movies knew Emmas fate....It all follows the template of what he expect from a war movie...the only surprises for me were that he depicted the U.S. troops behaving badly which is a very rare thing for that era and the sene at the end where the German soldier didnt kill the American. Still not sure what he was trying to say with that The look of the film was great The background music was at times distracting it just seemed like it didnt fit for this type of film. Did anyone watch the end credits? What was that? It seemed more like the end of a horror movie. Maybe that is what he was going for but it really didnt work for me felt more like I went in one theater and walked out of another Reply Jack says October 18 2014 at 1144 pm German soliders scalp? Barbara? Did you even watch the film? It was part of a face that belonged to the former assistant driver that Norm was replacing. The girls name was Emma not Barbara. Reply Mark says October 20 2014 at 702 am The reviewer is referring to the 2012 film Barbara which starred Alicia von Rittberg Reply prodikar says October 18 2014 at 930 am how am I suppose to take this review seriously (unless someone else already has mentioned this?) if the critic was clearly not paying attention to critical details while sitting / sleeping through this great piece of narrative film? The skin the rookie assistant driver cleans belongs to his predecessor. Reply Michael Dennis (MikeTheModerate) says October 18 2014 at 1258 am Some astute students of history may point out that the plot of Mr. Pitts previous World War II outing is also fictitious and never could have happened unlike his most recent effort was is at the bare minimum at least plausible. The Battle of Villers-Bocage placed a Tiger (like the one from the movie) against an entire allied column.... and the German won the engagement. Even with the American Sherman being less well armed and armored the opponents that were faced were also less capable. Shooting down the film for lack of accuracy when your ideal historical movie is a farcical Tarantino film is going a bit far. Reply IT 2 IT says October 16 2014 at 634 am DIDNT Pitt make this SAME flick ---LAST year? GQ goes to WWII is DONE-to-DEATH GQ goes to war ---is NOWHERE Reply Donald Cuff says October 15 2014 at 330 am Sadly it isnt possible to take anyone who thinks the foul mouth festival ""Inglorious Basterds"" was a ""better"" war film seriously. Reply Jim N says October 16 2014 at 453 pm Youre right Ingolious Basterds was not really a war movie - fun but not a war movie. Reply Konrad says October 13 2014 at 815 pm That was a very insightful amp; reasoned out review which I very much enjoyed reading. However I think you missed the point that the real star of the show here is the tank and its Darth Vader like adversary. You wrote the style of the movie harkened back to an earlier era of film making..that the crew were one dimensional cut outs.. Well I hate to point this out but a lot of classic era fact based war films such as ""Battle of the Bulge"" amp; the ""Battle of Britain"" also contained a lot of card board cut out historical characters and typical stereo types such as the tank crewman redneck. On that level the characters as they are are all we really need to know. The audience is along for the ride as a camera newsman might have been trying to capture as much of the experience as he can in only a very limited period of time.. The attention to detail also wins for me the best supporting actor nod..Just consider this is the first time ever that a genuine functioning WW2 German tiger tank has been used in a movie and is not some prop department mock up riding around mounted on a jeep.. Reply Eric Leibman says October 12 2014 at 1251 pm RE The movie ""Fury."" I am puzzled. According to my understanding by that stage of the war the Germans were almost entirely beaten. Huge numbers of German soldiers were actually trying to get to the Americans and the British so they could SURRENDER to them fearing what the Russians would do to them if they were captured by the Red Army. What fierce fighting was going on at that point was almost entirely between the Russians and the Germans in the metro Berlin area. The Germans had completely ceased to be even a mild threat to the Americans by this point. So what possible menace could this German unit in ""Fury"" have possibly posed to American forces that it could logically be the stuff of a major film? Can anyone help me out here? Reply Roy Beers says October 25 2014 at 415 pm It was an SS battalion of panzergrenadiers whose position gave it the opportunity to strike at a vulnerable rear echelon supply dump which would cause carnage and also slow the offensive on that part of the front. Even at this stage of the war a perfectly credible scenario. In real lifed the Nazis would have had far more panzerschreck hand-held anti-tank weapons and would have despatched the tank very quickly after recovering from their initial surprise. However still an excellent film - one of the most believable WW2 movies Ive seen. Reply lukelukey says October 13 2014 at 729 am Some german units were only too happy to surrender to the Americans -Volkksturm volunteer units made up of old men and Hitler Youth often chose reality over glory. Others led by die-hard Nazi commanders fought to the last man... Reply edmundcharles.55gmail.com says October 11 2014 at 1044 am Alas some of the greatest and most prolific films in US film history have never won an Oscar award thats just the way the system works out not everyone can be recognized yet the true merit of a film lay in its ultimate success with the audience without whom all else is trivial glitter. Sometimes it takes years or decades for a film to gather a loyal following and how lucky we are that these films were made. e will be poor shape if eeveryone makes movies with the same scripted template and formula. Reply edmundcharles.55gmail.com says October 11 2014 at 1037 am War movies from the eastern front are much rarer in the US film industry. Enemy at the Gates was a pale adoption from the book which dealt with greater destruction and cruelty than most US movie audiences could bear. Remember the USSR last over 20 million people in WWII neither the US or any other western nation can fathom that level of destruction. Uncle Joes Red army took a serious revenge on the Germans. Reply pete gibbons says October 11 2014 at 1022 am Any review that references SLA Marshall gets my vote. And to answer the reviewers question about whether a single tank would stand its ground against a force of 300 enemy...Audie Murphy did it without the tank. Reply edmundcharles.55gmail.com says October 11 2014 at 1031 am Concur- aside from those in the military history community SLA Marshall is unknown whereas Tom Clancy and James Ambrose are like rock stars yet one cannot substitute popularity and fame for serious scholarship. SLA Marshall is correct about those in combat who never fired their weapons at the enemy the USSR drew the same findings and this (among other factors) led to their adoption of the full-auto AK-47 assault rifle and the highly mobilized mathematically formula of battle. Conversely the Soviets discovered that soldiers tended to fire their weapons when given a fill automatic capability thus a weapon firing even inaccuratly was better than a rifle that was never fired at the enemy so the USSR soldiers were taught to fire their AK-47s and other weapons quite liberally in the direction of the enemy and it also made for good morale. The USSR doctrine was predicated on huge liberal logistic being available so almost limitless ammunition supplied was assured. Just FYI. Reply edmundcharles.55gmail.com says October 11 2014 at 1020 am ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a better film By what yardstick? The biggest profanity besides the story itself that is is the spelling of the title of that film to which any parenthood should be disowned- pure tongue-in-cheek spun BS Fury as a movie plot may have its limitations for instance it would probably have been better timed to take place in August 1944 in France with the 3rd Army armored break-out under General Patton vice the waining days of the Third Reich. If these characters did serve together from North Africa then they have indeed see a hell of a lot of combat and are suffering from the fatigue of long combat. Yes soldiers bond in combat with their fellow soldiers (Marines Airmen sailors) because you have to to both stay alive and to remain sane; the world only consists of that which is directly around you and tomorrow is merely a dream or a promise. Id have placed a green armored corps private into the group instead of a admin/typist who without any tank crew training is a definite crew liability yet placing this greenhorn as the assistant driver/radio operator is the most least hazardous place for this soldier unless or until the driver gets killed or wounded. As for scripted dialogue and action well this is the stuff of which movies and dreams are made every Hollywood movie is canned script of often lofty words and ideals by overly clever and intelligence script writers do you for once think that Lawrence Olivier Katherine Hepburn or Richard Burton could have cleverly composed the clever lines which they so famously spoke on the screen (yes I believe that Orson Wells was an exception here)? In reality if most movies and TV shows depicted line action and dialogue as it exist in the daily vernacular there would exist no profitable entertainment media. Entertainment by sheer design necessity is designed to enhance and embolden the ordinary and mundane to further make it dramatic and extraordinary. Reply harveycritic says October 11 2014 at 926 am The character played by Alicia von Rittberg is not Barbara but rather Emma. Reply Mike says October 10 2014 at 1004 pm DougW Here are some signs the film is in trouble. They moved it from November Oscar season to mid October. Never a good sign. The trailers look terrible. There doesnt seem to be a story there just unnatural sounding soundbites cut to music. Weve hardly seen any of the Pitt-Jolie kids like we do when Brad goes all out for the PR push. Trust me when Jolie releases her film in December those kids will suddenly be EVERYWHERE. They wouldnt have scheduled production of ""By the Sea"" to overlap with the release of this film if Pitt was going to be doing major press for this. Hes done all of two interviews so far... for British publications. Reply Hugh Daly says October 11 2014 at 934 am I dont think the reviewer actually saw the whole film. He makes so many mistakes about characters and plot. You know what they say those who can do those who cant review. Reply John T. says October 10 2014 at 954 pm ""will rely on a strong showing overseas where its fantasy of American exceptionalism will seem all the more egregious."" Yeah I stopped reading after that. Reply DougW says October 10 2014 at 543 pm How do you know theres a ""disappointing domestic reaction ahead""? Reply Seem says October 10 2014 at 506 pm Interesting that this film has a much more impressive cast of Jewish actors (Logan Lerman Jon Bernthal Shia LaBeouf Jason Isaacs) playing WWII soldiers than Pitts Inglourious Basterds did. Reply John Freimann says October 10 2014 at 200 pm ""Not only did the standoff depicted in ""Fury"" never happen...."" Since when did it have to happen Dummy. Its called a ""movie""; it could be a play a novel a TV show any of those things. What it does not have to be is a real occurrence or based on one. Learn your craft Buster Reply harry georgatos says October 10 2014 at 103 pm The last thing I wanted to hear was bland and full of cliches. FURY needed to be a bloody and realist account in the mechanics of this battle. Still I plan to watch the movie as END OF WATCH was good in its execution by Ayers not so much with the embarrasing he-man and he-woman grunt of the disappointing SABOTAGE. Reply edmundcharles.55gmail.com says October 11 2014 at 1023 am Agreed- not everything needs to be based on a real event less we would suffer the loss of the historical novel and countless works of dramatized fiction. Reply Theresa Corigliano says October 10 2014 at 1243 pm This incident may not have happened but I an tell you having just returned from commemorating the 70th Anniversary of D Day there are countless stories of a handful of American or British soldiers being severely outnumbered and taking a stand. Reply macd says October 10 2014 at 1154 am Shia LaBeouf a ""pretty-boy""? This talent-free creep may be a lot of things but ""pretty-boy"" isnt one of them Reply Dale says January 3 2015 at 1234 pm Shia LAbeouf is creepy  he is not a pretty boy but he surely does not lack talent brad Pitt stated that Shia is the greatest actor he knows. Shia killed it in this movie  tears in his eyes almost the whole time. He is quite talented Reply Hugh Daly says October 10 2014 at 1142 am The reviewer shows his lack of research into the origins of the story amp; plot points as this hit piece unfolds. I predict Ayer and Co will get numerous awards including Oscar nods before the sound of tank combat recedes in Hollywood. Reply Mike says October 12 2014 at 603 pm I love how when anybody dares to criticize anything Pitt related it has to be a conspiracy. Its not a hit piece. Its simply a review by someone who didnt care for the film. Reply H.M. says October 10 2014 at 905 pm Yes Oscars nods a plenty ""Mission Accomplished"" too. My eyes hurt they rolled so much on that comment. Reply See All 62 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Jason Bourne Targets 60M+; Bad Moms Gets Sassy With 26.5M...

Writer-director David Ayers brash assaultive Brad Pitt drama manages some evocative imagery and achieves visceral impact by enacting a hellacious atmosphere that never lets up -- but Ayer takes the mission too literally and winds up literally lost in the fog of war. The failings of ""Fury"" come early on when an opening shot that finds a Nazi soldier riding a white horse through the smoldering wreckage of American tanks. Out of the shadows jumps knife-wielding sergeant Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Pitt). The scene like many others following it contains a grotesque hellacious quality yet still feels empty. Its a stark beautifully lit illustration that war is hell. But what else is new? READ MORE Fury Starring Brad Pitt Closes London Film Festival in Bid for Oscar Contention Despite its 134-minute running time ""Fury"" never addresses that question. Returning to his tank -- which bears the movies title on its cannon -- Wardaddys take-no-prisoners approach quickly comes to light The war may be nearing completion but he remains in the thick of it. As the tank barrels forward he hovers with his soldiers who include Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (a mustachioed Shia LaBeouf) Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Pena) Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (Jon Bernthal) and Sergeant Miles (Scott Eastwood). At a nearby base Wardaddy is tasked with toughening up his new driver the scrawny Norman ""Cobb"" Ellison (Logan Lerman). At first cruelly forcing the young recruit to inflict violence on Nazi prisoners Wardaddy later takes pity on the lightweight. The movies expressionistic qualities extend to its bluntly drawn characters Wardaddys ambiguous stature as both imperialistic monster of combat and principled warrior sets the stage for newbie Ellison to learn a heavy-handed lesson in moral equivalency as he experiences death firsthand. The movies trajectory is mapped out as Ellison is swept up in a dust-caked world of cruel masculinity and rampant bloodshed. ""Fury"" scores points for attempting to depict WWII in strikingly minimalist terms but Ayer struggles to deepen those intentions. Despite Pitts loud and domineering performance the real star of ""Fury"" is cinematographer Roman Vasyonov. His grey-tinted visuals create a hyperreal quality to the narrative which largely unfolds on expansive landscapes strewn with wreckage. The impressionistic style is particularly effective during the spectacular finale a showdown that pits the tank against hundreds of Nazi assailants as the gold-tinted shadows take the plot into the realm of abstraction. But the extraordinary visuals never develop a substantial takeaway and neither do the characters During a prolonged dinner-table sequence that finds Pitt and Lerman spending a few gentler moments with surviving German women in a bombed-out town Ayer goes great lengths to demonstrate the challenge of finding solace in the midst of a terribly ugly situation. The sequence holds potential but goes on far too long as if begging to be taken seriously. And thats the problem with ""Fury"" as a whole Every thematic possibility is addressed in the broadest strokes. Of course ""Fury"" doesnt aim for realism and Ayer has never been a filmmaker particularly interested in naturalism. His movies use the extremes of action and conversation to convey big ideas with fast pugnacious energy. As with his found-footage police drama ""End of Watch"" and the DEA thriller ""Sabotage"" the director makes a considerable attempt to barrel inside the ecosystem of a dirty reckless profession. But his plodding dim-witted script never rises to the level of his intentions. Instead it returns to obvious dialogue meant to underscore the warmongering sensibilities in play. ""This is an American tank"" Wardaddy barks when one of his compatriots uses Spanish. ""We talk American"" So does the movie which uses its crass thundering exterior as an excuse for the absence of pretty much anything else. Though ostensibly an ensemble piece ""Fury"" offers little in the way of memorable performances. LaBeoufs bland performance is overshadowed by his recent public spectacles while Pena and Bernthal play thin stereotypes. Lerman is serviceable as the sole sympathetic figure though his whiny presence offers nothing new. These are archetypal characters may serve its stripped-down aesthetic but their connotations are symbolically weak. In principle the movie has a kinship with Quentin Tarantinos similarly embellished WWII crowdpleaser ""Inglourious Basterds"" which also features Pitt as a combative sergeant. Once again the main soldiers reporting to the character are Jewish. But while ""Fury"" shows its men fueled by rage it trades the irony of Tarantinos movie for triviality. ""Done much killin?"" Wardaddy asks his latest disciple. ""You will"" Later he inexplicably becomes a guru-like instructor in a lesson of moral equivalency declaring that ""ideas are peaceful. History is violent."" Its like Ayer is begging us to care. He achieves greater impact in the pure claustrophobia of scenes set inside the tank which becomes a moving metaphor for the sense of existential confinement. But anyone familiar with the 2009 Israeli film ""Lebanon which exclusively takes place inside an Israeli tank will know that this moving metaphor only works when its inhabits infuse it with life. ""Fury"" never evolves beyond its conceptual ambition. The sights of burning bodies and tanks crunching soldiers in foxholes cant help but manage some horrific specificity. But with time the repeated flashes of ugliness grow redundant. Intended to shock us ""Fury"" has a deadening effect until it becomes a victim of the same brutality it was designed to indict. Grade C ""Fury"" opens nationwide on October 17.READ MORE Why Brad Pitt-Starrer Fury Is Moving from November to October (VIDEO) This Article is related to Reviews and tagged Brad Pitt David Ayer Reviews More From IndieWireBoJack Horseman Brilliantly Argues Why Comedy Belongs in the Abortion DebateReview Vice Principals Charms With A-Grade Class Clowns But This VP Is No VeepReview Stranger Things is Still Waiting for Something New To Make It Feel AliveReview The Night Of Serial-izes Law amp; Order But Its All About The Verdict Comments Jean May 12 2016 820 pm What KIND of an idiot review is this?

Reply Jacob May 12 2016 820 pm This is possibly one of the worst reviews Ive ever seen...Sergeant Miles was not even a part of the tank squad. Did you just look through the wikipedia article and write this? Also Norman was not the driver but just an assistant driver and a gunner.

Reply helga May 12 2016 820 pm Great review. this movie has big name actors a lot of violence and very little else. Reply Doc May 12 2016 820 pm A number of people dont know or understand how real war is and dont understand those people that try to bring a glimpse of that to the screen. Just remember that the critic hasnt been there and never will be Reply Duddi May 12 2016 820 pm NO - Actually Aldo Raines rank was ""Lieutenant"". - And also I wanted to state that probably WWII movies or Pitt arent something Eric Kohn likes. He usually writes credible and coherent reviews but when he misses the mark he misses it for a big time. Anyway cant say much about Fury cuz I havent seen it yet but I was remind of I.B.s review from Kohn... and heres a piece for the rest of you who have not read the original review... ""Despite the injection of content from a variety of directions Basterds lacks the crackly excitement of Tarantinos other efforts mainly because he cant seem to tie the whole package together."" Reply Ricardo May 12 2016 820 pm Eric Kohn your reviews are the worst Reply No May 12 2016 820 pm I know it may be minor but Pitt played an officer not a sergeant in Inglourious Basterds. Reply Smee May 12 2016 820 pm Interesting that this film has a much more impressive cast of Jewish actors (Logan Lerman Jon Bernthal Shia LaBeouf Jason Isaacs) playing WWII soldiers than Pitts Inglourious Basterds did. Reply okay May 12 2016 820 pm another terrible review from indiewire Reply Tom May 12 2016 820 pm ""the movie has a kinship with Quentin Tarantinos similarly embellished WWII crowdpleaser ""Inglourious Basterds"" which also features Pitt as a combative sergeant"" A film that was also given a negative review by this reviewer.
