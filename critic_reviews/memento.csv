With Guy Pearce Joe Pantoliano Carrie-Anne Moss. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Running time 115 mins. Rated R Violence language and some drug content. 3 Stars. Have you ever tried to remember something by slipping a note in your pocket putting your watch on the other wrist scribbling a message on your hand? Meet ""Mementos"" Leonard Shelby. He has left so many notes in so many places hed be lost without them. Literally lost. Shelby (""L.A. Confidentials"" Guy Pearce) has no short-term memory. Something happened to him involving a break-in at his house a confrontation with burglars the death of his wife a knock on his head. He remembers his life before that night and bits and pieces of the fight but nothing since. Yet he has spent weeks maybe months trying to find and kill the man who got away. Writer-director Christopher Nolans second film is one of the most original and ultimately confounding mind games to reach the screen since ""The Usual Suspects."" Its a story that moves forward and backward at the same time toying with both its protagonist and the audience overloading our short-term memory even more than his. Shelby awakes each morning in an anonymous motel room filled with index cards napkins scraps of paper Polaroid snapshots ... and a full-length mirror that reveals clues permanently tattooed on his body. They represent the sum of his investigation when he went to bed and after replenishing his empty memory bank hes off to pile on even more clues. Nolan has taken a seemingly simple noir story and made it complex by breaking it down and turning it around. The movie opens with the storys violent ending and works backward toward its meaning. Who is this person shot dead in the opening scene and why is he killed? Well see the victim (Joe Pantoliano) again and again with a kind of ""Groundhog Day"" monotony having to introduce himself to Shelby every time they meet. There are other recurring characters a waitress (Carrie-Anne Moss) who enlists Shelbys help against her abusive boyfriend; a motel clerk who keeps moving him into cheaper rooms knowing he wont remember. Theres also a subplot told in flashbacks about another man with no short-term memory and a skeptical diabetic wife who decides to test him by having him repeatedly inject her with insulin until the last shot kills her. We learn that Shelby was an insurance-claims investigator and the couple policy holders whose claim he denied on grounds of fraud. Its tiring work watching ""Memento"" trying to keep things straight and to assure ourselves its all worthwhile. My problem with ""The Usual Suspects"" was that it was ultimately a shaggy-dog story; there was no way to participate in the story by trying to outguess it. You can certainly participate in ""Memento."" The movie is totally absorbing even though its hard to care much about Shelby and nearly impossible to stay with it. The filmmakers may be right in suggesting that ""Memento"" will be the perfect movie to slip into your DVD player which will allow you to fact-check as you go. Maybe then Ill find out who really killed Shelbys wife. Its a little thing but Id like to know.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Pretend for a minute that Christopher Nolans extraordinary Memento is nothing more than a gimmicky noir exercise grinding out its plot with cool efficiency and hollow mechanics devoid of any larger significance. Disregard its mind-bending profundities about the nature of memory and existence and what it means to be human. Even if all these things were willfully ignored and Memento were simply reduced to an architectural blueprint it would still be akin to watching Bobby Fischer play chess seeing the board several moves ahead of his opponent. Its an exhausting experience just to keep up--be sure to arrive on time and stay seated until the credits roll--but for Nolan to dream up a scenario this complex and yet work it out so thoroughly seems almost inconceivable. His story marries two high concepts that would be baffling enough on their own let alone together. Traumatized by his wifes rape and murder Guy Pearce suffers from a rare neurological disorder called anteriograde amnesia that prevents him from creating any new memories. Basically the world as he understood it 10 minutes ago has evaporated from his mind without a trace. In order to exact revenge on his wifes killer Pearce has devised an elaborate system of tattoos Polaroids note cards and file folders to help him piece together the facts. He also has to uncover the possible ulterior motives of shady ally Joe Pantoliano and a sullen bartender played by Carrie-Anne Moss. To further complicate matters Nolan begins with the end and ends with the beginning so the action takes place in overlapping fragments that move backwards in time. On top of all that he inserts black-and-white scenes of Pearce on the phone in his motel room telling the harrowing story of a fellow amnesia sufferer (Stephen Tobolowsky) he met in his days as an insurance claims investigator. Memento has endless fun playing with hiccuping time and ephemeral memory In one of its funniest scenes Pearce wonders if hes being chased or giving chase; in one of its most suspenseful he scrambles to find a pen before he forgets a persons diabolical abuses. For a while Nolans twin gimmicks seem to exist solely for clever gamesmanship like the achronology in his low-budget neo-noir debut Following. But the astonishing payoff takes the film to another level entirely unleashing a battery of existential questions that shed new light on everything that precedes it. More than just a shallow mindfuck the twist in Memento is that theres more going on than the head can hold.

"This Is A Mystery That Leaves A Mark - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections This Is A Mystery That Leaves A MarkMovies - MOVIE REVIEW - MementoOriginal Chilling And Complicated Memento Is A Thriller That Makes You Think.April 20 2001|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticYou have to pay close attention to Memento the most original thriller to come along in years -- and one of the best.A diabolical puzzle of a movie it requires your complete concentration as each tiny piece snaps into place. You also have to have a fairly good memory which is ironic because memory is just what this riveting film is about.Leonard Shelby the man at the center of the mystery has no short-term memory. He knows who he is and he can remember events up until the moment that he received a violent blow to the head -- a blow that came during an incident in which his wife was also attacked.Since then Leonards mission has been to track down the attacker. But that mission is complicated by Leonards inability to make new memories. Every time he falls asleep all recent events fade away.""You really do need a system if youre going to make it work"" Leonard tells himself referring to his complicated life. And indeed he does have a system.Leonard keeps a large paper file about the attacker whose name he has discovered is ""John G."" More basic information -- such as where Leonard is living what his own car looks like the names and faces of the people he knows -- is maintained in a small collection of Polaroid snapshots on which he scribbles notes to himself.The few facts that Leonard regards as fundamental and immutable he tattoos on his body. The most basic of these -- which he has emblazoned across his chest in reverse so that hell be sure to see it correctly in the mirror -- is a grim and constant reminder""John G. raped and murdered my wife.""Christopher Nolan the thirtyish writer-director of this superb neo-noir has only one other movie to his credit the well-received low-budget Following (1998). In Memento (which opens today) Nolan uses a storytelling device that may sound like a gimmick but that is actually the most effective and efficient way to tell this particular tale.The story begins in the present and works backwards in short sections We see what happened most recently then we see what led immediately to that then to that and so on.Watching Memento youre always a little worried about whether youre picking up enough information and whether youll remember everything thats essential when the next section starts. The movie in other words places you in much the same state of heightened anxiety as Leonard.What better way to comment on the importance -- and capriciousness -- of memory than to put the viewer in Leonards shoes?Guy Pearce the by-the-book detective in L.A. Confidential plays Leonard with what could be called a casual intensity.His eyes are attentive and suspicious; his lean sculpted body is always on full alert. Yet Leonard also manages to effect an air of insouciance.He knows that his memory problem can make other people edgy so he does what he can to put them at ease. Whenever he explains his problem he does so with the nonchalance that you might use to excuse a bad haircut or scratch on your face.He doesnt want others to see how torn-up he is inside.Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) play Natalie and Teddy a bartender and an apparent friend who figure somehow in the mystery.Natalie who seems to be having troubles of her own with drug dealers looks needy and even desperate. Teddy meanwhile is both familiar in his manner and strangely irritating.Its vexingly hard for Leonard -- or us -- to get a handle on either.For a filmmaker who has only directed two films Nolan is shockingly confident. The spareness of his storytelling -- with no gesture wasted -- shows that.Although the unusual structure of this movie requires some repetition the result feels terrifically streamlined. You always want more from Memento never less.The crisp cinematography goes along with the movies spare form and also reminds you to pay attention. No detail may be too small to count.Even a scratch on a face could be crucial.Because the plots structure makes hash of the conventional wisdom about screenplays (""A story must have a beginning a middle and an end . . . "") it should be required viewing by all aspiring screenwriters.When it comes to storytelling after all you may ""need a system if youre going to make it work."" But as Leonard has discovered the only system worth having is the one you create for yourself.Nolan knows exactly what hes doing and he knows just how to get it done. What he achieves in Memento is more than amazing.Unforgettable almost.

Confidential) suffers from a short-term memory deficit severe enough to reduce to embarrassed silence any and all graying boomers who bray about no longer being able to put a name to a face. Not only can Leonard not remember the names of people hes just met he cant recall having met them at all or for that matter anything that happened earlier than a few minutes ago. Leonard wouldnt know a close friend from a chance acquaintance which makes him terrifyingly dependent on the ambiguous kindness of strangers two of whom -- a friendly barmaid called Natalie (The Matrixs Carrie-Anne Moss) and a nervously jovial fellow named either Teddy or John (Joe Pantoliano of same) -- appear to be vying to help him avenge himself on the unknown enemy who raped and murdered his wife and left him with the head injury that brought on his condition. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - On one level Memento which Nolan (whose second outing this is after making a funky little indie in 1998 called Following) adapted from a short story by his brother Jonathan is an audacious murder mystery that rests on a neat inversion of the amnesia formula that has propped up so many films noirs. Where your average movie amnesiac has lost his past but creates a new self while waiting to recover it Leonard remembers or says he does every detail of his past up until the trauma. He has an old self -- which he relates in periodic black-and-white sequences to an unknown listener on the phone and which has an eerie relevance to his current predicament -- but cant make a new one. Incapable of creating or sustaining new memories hes left without the tools to groom a more or less viable identity of the kind that allows most of us to get through the day without succumbing to gibbering paranoia.Like anyone who finds himself overwhelmed by indeterminacy Leonard is desperate to establish hard facts. He takes Polaroids and writes endless Post-its to remind himself of whom he meets and the name of the dingy motel where hes staying and swears by cryptic messages he finds tattooed onto his body in his own handwriting. But without knowledge or a basis for trusting others he has to gamble on instinct which may Nolan implies be as unreliable as memory. Leonard has to work overtime just to run in place -- exhausting for him but enormous fun for his creator. While Memento may bear the marks of the usual noir obsessions with alienation and mistrust conceptually the movie has more in common with Harold Ramis Groundhog Day than it has with Alfred Hitchcocks Spellbound. And though Leonard doesnt have the implacable routine of Bill Murrays endlessly repeated day to order his existence he too is marooned in an eternal present -- and Nolan gleefully maroons us right there with him. To those of us with a Dorian Gray complex this may sound like a peak experience but its maliciously replete with diffuse anxiety. For most of this exquisitely structured disquisition on the unstructured life were kept as much in the dark about Leonards true identity and those of his adversaries as he is. It takes a while to realize that Nolan has his way of feeding us a meta-story not necessarily in the right order.In common with many committed stylists Nolan has trouble getting you to care about his characters. (It seems no accident that two of his actors are cast from The Matrix a frigid formal exercise if ever there was.) Theres a flashback in the movie in which Nolan clearly means to cement our sympathy for the trap in which Leonard or someone very like him finds himself. But then the ball is immediately dropped in favor of mere flash artistry. Without Pearces taut radiant presence to project the pathos -- and the euphoria -- of a man hanging on to coherence moment by nerveless moment Memento would leave you emotionally dry as a bone. Still for the philosophically inclined I doubt whether anyone -- even in the glory days of film noir -- could have come up with a tale as vertiginously relativistic as this one. If nothing else Memento is a savvy comment on the queasy uncertainties of the postmodern condition in which history goes no further back than yesterdays news and knowledge is supplanted by ""information"" from a tumult of spin-controlled unreliable narrators.

Sep. 13 600pm Like Leonard the young heroine -- if such can be called a woman whos capable of killing a policeman over a traffic violation -- in Volker Schlondorffs The Legend of Rita has to reinvent herself over and over. Only its not her biochemistry thats out of sync but the divided soul of postwar Germany after the Berlin Wall went up. Schlondorff means to probe that schism through the rise and fall of the West German anarchist group RAF. The groups subsidiary -- known outside Germany as the Baader-Meinhof gang -- managed to get in a whole lot of ideologically motivated carnage much of it devolving upon innocent bystanders before becoming the property of the East German intelligence agency Stasi which tried simultaneously to disband the group and shelter those of its members who were left standing.The first half-hour of The Legend of Rita is parsed as an action movie. Though Im not at all sure that the actual Baader-Meinhof gang could have burst into a bank yelling ""Down with capitalism"" and ""Venceremos"" without drawing giggles all round from the tellers the dialogue here is like much of Schlondorff and Wolfgang Kohlhaases screenplay a thrifty piece of shorthand designed to give you the drift of the groups intellectual influences. Thereafter the film veers sharply away from politics a baffling departure for the director of The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum (1975) and The Tin Drum (1979). A strong case could be made that the RAF for all its vaunted anti-Nazism and advocacy of the working class was in important respects a continuation of German absolutism by other means. In The Legend of Rita Schlondorff approaches his material with the gingerly timidity of a man who cant fully commit to a shift in his views on that branch of the German left. Instead he opts to put the proverbial human face on terrorism by telling the story of one of its members a composite figure presumably called Rita Vogt (Bibiana Beglau) who senses the groups imminent collapse and under the wing of a sympathetic Stasi apparatchik (Martin Wuttke) disappears into a new life as an upstanding East German proletarian.The movies eye-poppingly reductive not to say condescending thesis is that Rita is a tender vulnerable soul who does whatever she does -- from joining the group through an affair with its leader to saving the bruised soul of a fellow worker at the East German factory where she works -- for love. In fact Rita seems to do little but fall in love not least with the German Democratic Republic where amazingly she fails to notice that just about everyone but she and her handler wants out of the dreary parsimony of life behind the Iron Curtain. The story of Ritas successive incarnations as an enthusiastic Communist and her fall symbolically timed to coincide with the fall of the Wall is absorbing enough due in large measure to Beglaus vibrant performance.

Comments (5) Memento With its classically seedy southern California setting this second feature by Christopher Nolan is more memorable than his first Following (1998). Nonetheless it exemplifies what the English mean when they call something ""too clever by half."" Its a fascinating and gripping but also rather heartless and forgettable tale much of it told backward about an insurance investigator (Guy Pearce) with short-term amnesia trying to avenge the rape and murder of his wife. Severely hampered by his periodically forgetting everything thats happened since this tragedy he tries to compensate by shooting Polaroids and tattooing his body with various reminders and instructions. More a puzzle than a meaningful story it reminds me of how Edmund Wilson compared reading a mystery to eagerly unpacking a box of excelsior only to find a few rusty nails at the bottom. With Carrie-Anne Moss Joe Pantoliano and Stephen Tobolowsky. R 113 min.

Im talking about the Mobius-strip dreamscapes of Inception the sleight-of-hand trickery of The Prestige and most of all his dizzying breakout behind the camera Memento (2001 R 1 hr. 53 mins.). Now marking its 10th birthday with a Blu-ray debut Memento is one of those jigsaw puzzles whose pieces snap together more tightly with each viewing. Fueling it all is a performance by Guy Pearce thats as indelible as the tattoo ink covering his body. Hes a mural of vengeance. Pearces Leonard Shelby is a hero straight out of a 40s film noir -- he remembers nothing...other than the certainty that he must track down and kill the person who murdered his wife. Every time he wakes up hes essentially starting from scratch with only the ""facts"" stenciled on his body to guide him. Nolan the merry prankster unspools Leonards story in reverse so the audience is solving the case with him always reevaluating whether to trust the weaselly Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and the femme fatale Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). The Blu-rays extras are mostly leftovers from previous DVD editions but the film itself has aged beautifully. Its a throwback to a time when indie upstarts like Nolan Darren Aronofsky and David O. Russell were flipping the bird to the establishment saying Hey here we come. The good news is 10 years later all three are up for Best Picture. They are the establishment.

I must confess that while the end credits were rolling I decided that there was no real payoff for the story which had been told in an always-uncertain sequence of images and impressions. The reconstructed premise is this Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) a one-time insurance investigator has completely lost his short-term memory after being shot during the rape-murder of his wife. The program notes describe his condition as ""a rare untreatable form of memory loss"" He remembers the crime itself vividly as well as everything that happened to him before that point but since the damage to his brain he cannot retain a new memory longer than 15 minutes. The only way he can keep track of what has happened in his recent past is to take Polaroid pictures make notes and even adorn his body parts with tattoos to record what he has learned. Normally one would expect a few hospital scenes with the usual medical mumbo-jumbo to authenticate Leonards condition. Instead we are thrust immediately into his troubled mind. In the opening moments a murder rewinds on-screen a photograph undevelops and is sucked up into a flashing Polaroid; a bloody carnage is reassembled into human features as a gun barrel pulls away from a twisting mouth. We are at the end of the story and we are being pulled back to the beginning of one mans quest to avenge the crimes against his wife. There is no official collaboration with the police who have written off the case because Leonard himself managed to kill one of the criminals before he was shot and the police do not accept his story of a second predator. Leonard has no money problems as he drives around in his Jaguar stopping at seedy motels out of Raymond Chandlers southern California to question potential witnesses and suspects in the case. He is befriended by a mysteriously motivated waitress named Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who has her own agenda for Leonard in the disposal of her abusive boyfriend. Far from taking pity on Leonards bizarre condition the people he encounters seek ways to exploit him. Motel managers keep shifting him to cheaper rooms at the same expensive prices. A persistently genial pest named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) keeps stalking him with a strange cheerfulness that seems suspicious. Indeed Leonard has made a note at some unremembered period not to believe anything Teddy says. The audience is left with no subordinate characters to trust with the result that the paranoia spreads from the protagonist to the spectator. Even the flashbacks to Leonards idyllically presented wife do not give us enough information about what kind of life they led together. Then right in the middle of the story there is a digression to a case Leonard handled as an insurance investigator. The case involved a claim of short-memory loss by a worker named Sammy (Stephen Tobolowski). Leonard decided that Sammy was faking his condition because Sammy seemed to flash an expression of recognition at Leonards second visit. Consequently Sammy was denied Workmans Compensation to pay for his enormous medical bills. In one harrowing scene Sammy proves to his wife (Harriet Harris) that he does indeed suffer from short-term memory loss despite her own hopeful doubts that he is only pretending to be afflicted. The proof consists of his repeatedly injecting her with insulin for her diabetes over a short period of time at her request. She dies and he is confined to an institution. Leonard was wrong in his diagnosis of Sammy but why does he suddenly remember his misjudgment? And why do the Nolan brothers even introduce Sammy a character with such overwhelming dramatic charisma? It was at this point that the film began to confuse me. Teddy suggests that Leonards late wife was also suffering from diabetes and I thought I caught a glimpse of Leonard jabbing his wife with a needle. But I could not be sure inasmuch as I was beginning to succumb to Leonards haze. What was real and what was not and who cares? This is not to say that the acting or writing or directing was to blame but rather that the whole conception was clearly designed to subvert its mystery-suspense- noir genre by leaving too many questions unanswered and too many ambiguities unresolved. Jonathan Nolan whose short story formed the basis for his brother Christophers script says in the production notes that ""the crime thriller genre has become a sort of a 90-minute call-and-response session with the audience they know all the tropes and tricks backwards and forwards. Increasingly the question for thrillers has become what happens next? And while Memento has plenty of twists and turns for the audience to enjoy its asking a different question we know what happens next-the first frames of the film are the last seconds of the story. The question here is why? What sets Leonard in motion toward murder in the first place? The murder is a given; the question is the motive."" Interestingly enough 30-year-old writer-director Christopher Nolan observes if only half-jokingly that Memento is an ideal film to see on DVD ""Its use of flashbacks that redo the past and the abuses of memory on the part of the hero and the film itself make this the kind of film that you may want to stop and rewind and review .... My brother Jonahs short story gave me the suggestion that I developed in the screenplay an examination of the function of memory in the art of storytelling. In Leonards character his reconstruction of identity and shaping of a future from the material record of the past is really just an exaggeration of what everybody does in real life."" Mr. Nolan is a comparatively young man and I suspect that Memento will appeal mostly to comparatively young viewers. Older viewers like me may have serious problems with short-term memory loss as a subject. In fact only recently I forgot the name of Amsterdam Avenue when I was giving instructions to a cab driver. I knew what Amsterdam Avenue looked like and in what direction it went. I knew it was between Columbus Avenue and Broadway but for the life of me I could not remember the name of the street itself. I console myself with the rationalization that since my memory capacity is limited every time I remember a movie actors name I forget a street. But lately I have been forgetting movie actors as well. The problem may be that I have seen too many movies in my life and my memory bank is overdrawn. Dont get me wrong. I am neither upset nor disturbed by Memento  only vaguely dissatisfied. I simply dont buy Jonathan Nolans thesis that audiences know all the tropes and tricks of crime thrillers backward and forward. As Robert Warshaw once noted the variety of faces and bodies and personalities of movie performers provide the variety of tropes we look for in literature. It is not only what but who that counts in movies. If the original cast of Casablanca -Ronald Reagan Ann Sheridan and Dennis Morgan-had remained to the end would we have been celebrating the film for the past 60 years? I have become addicted to several serial entertainments on television namely Law amp; Order  The Sopranos  The West Wing  Inspector Morse  Ally McBeal  Gideons Crossing and Hercule Poirot . In each instance the who and the what are seamlessly integrated. But the proliferation of visual technology has now endowed my television set with 300 channels. As I channel-surf day and night I begin to broaden and coarsen my critical instinct. I become aware of repeated patterns of behavior and keep redefining what I consider banal and stereotypical. I am too impatient to wait for nuances to appear one familiar camera set-up and I am off to the races. Lately however I have found that late-night channel surfing has had a pernicious effect on my dreams. Too much cruelty and violence. Inexplicable guilt and shame. I decided to go cold turkey and stop channel-surfing after midnight; the fragmentation was beginning to get to me. I have always based my theory of film history on the stylistic integrity of each individual movie and not on the recurring fragments in many movies for each context is different. What I object to in Memento is its final surrender to obfuscation in the name of a profound ambiguity. It reduces its characters to figures on a chessboard and supplies just enough clues to tantalize an audience without engaging its sympathies. The plot it constructs is ultimately artificial in that it keeps each character safely away from any expression of feeling. I had almost forgotten the call girl Leonard hires to reenact the crime by slamming a bathroom door as a sound cue for his memory. I was struck by the intelligently neutral expression on the face of the call girl. It was as if she belonged to a more rational world in which obsessive behavior was given short shrift. Still there is something wrong with the rhythm of the film something that does not preclude a certain virtuosity of execution. This is to say that I respect Mr. Nolans effort but I cannot reconcile myself to its studied confusions allegedly caused by a clinical disability. The tattoos are the final outrageous touch that transforms Leonard into some sort of circus performer. Now as I begin writing my memoir I regret that I did not keep more mementos of my past-though I am not sure there is not more in my past that I want to forget than remember. The problem with Leonard in Memento is that he never convinces us that he has enough emotional juice to seek revenge for a lost love. His rage is purely cerebral as his mementos become ends in themselves. Yet as I have indicated before young viewers may find Leonard more appealing in this alleged Information Age than I do.

It opens with reverse action a Polaroid photo fading and sliding into the camera a corpse returned to life a gun pulled from the head a bullet sucked into the barrel. The action thereafter plays forwards as usual - with Leonard Shelby (Pearce) out to track down and take revenge on whoever raped and killed his wife - save that the brief narrative chunks flash ever further backwards in time so that we share Shelbys confused point of view. He suffers from a rare kind of memory loss whereby while he remembers life before the murder hes been unable since then to recall anything for more than a few minutes. Hence hes forever forced to fathom afresh everything he sees and hears. The photos he takes for future reference and words he tattoos into his flesh help but life remains a mysterious very risky business. This taut ingenious thriller displays real interest in how perception and memory shape action identity and of course filmic storytelling. Moreover a plot strand featuring Stephen Tobolowsky even touches the heart. Theres grade A work from all concerned especially Pearce but in the end this is Nolans film. And he delivers with a vengeance.

I have never had a piece of film noir that left me as refreshingly confused as Memento. Director Christopher Nolan steps out of the ordinary even for a noir piece of work. We sit back expecting to view a typical dark and shadowy noir film but we suddenly find ourselves following the scenes backwards in succession all the way to the aEURoebeginning.aEUR In this unique style of storytelling Nolan opens up with Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce L.A. Confidential) shaking a Polaroid in rewind of a blood splattered wall. The first 2 minutes of the film moving backwards lets on to the idea of the story being told in reverse. Leonard had a career as an insurance investigator but now puts forth endless effort to a just and noble cause; a quest to avenge his wifeaEUR(tm)s (Jorja Fox CSI) rape/murder. Amidst the fiasco his wifeaEUR(tm)s assailants struck him with a damaging blow to the head; this left his memory as something to be desired so that he could only remember a few moments into the past. Every time Leonard wakes up he has to start over again on his pursuit for vengeance. And because of this audacious and chronologically reversed screenplay we too as the viewer are left trying to piece together this murder/mystery as soon as the last credit fades from the screen in the beginning. Mass confusion sets in on Leonard as he wakes up every morning to countless letters post-its and photos that resemble his unknown past. Each morning he walks past the mirror and each morning he rediscovers a canvas of tattoos covering his entire body (for example aEURoeJohn G raped and murdered your wifeaEUR); these markings tell the story from the time his wife was brutally killed up to the last few confusing moments he remembers. Along his epic journey to find justice or any resemblance thereof Leonard has a couple of people whispering in his ear as to which move to make next. Teddy (Joe Pantoliano Bad Boys) befriends Leonard in somewhat of a suspicious way with his quick babble and car-salesman like grin. Popping up at the most opportune times Leonard cautiously accepts TeddyaEUR(tm)s self-seeking insights. Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss The Matrix) warms up to Leonard quickly because she shares similar dismal circumstances that occurred in her recent past. Sympathetically Natalie helps Leonard make sense of his scribbled words and the black ink spread across his skin. With Leonard just losing someone he is very tender and susceptible to the soft touch and kind words of a beautiful woman. A little glimpse into the reality of amnesia is demonstrated as Leonard interacts with Burt the hotel clerk (Mark Boone Junior Batman Begins) that rents him a room while he is on his venture. Burt adds a small slice of humor to the film but in the long run we see he is just looking to cash in on LeonardaEUR(tm)s defective memory. Leonard soon becomes aware that Burt is charging him to stay in two rooms but pays him no mind because his dishonesty is obsolete compared to the villain still at large. Each time we move ahead to the scene chronologically before the one weaEUR(tm)ve just seen we see Leonard become more and more amateurish in his ability to decipher truth. We can only play detective throughout the film and piece together bits to the puzzle as to not who but why all this is happening. A streaming black and white prologue plays throughout the film in-between each scene that helps us understand the where what and how. There is nothing I can pick out of this film that would deter any person that claims to be a movie buff. Watching this movie is a rare treat; you are able to see a never-done-before way of putting the layers together of an already well written script. You will see the story fold itself back up and force you to put together the peopleaEUR(tm)s intentions the forgotten places and the foreshadowed events as they are taken out of the movie. I would suspect that this movie isnaEUR(tm)t for everyone; some will lose interest quickly because of being forced to analyze the complicated format.

Liam Lacey LIAM LACEY Published Friday Mar. 30 2001 1200AM EST Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 947AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Written and directed by Christopher Nolan Starring Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss Classification AA Rating  A t a time when mainstream theatres are to quote Michael Herrs recent book on Stanley Kubrick ""awash in Pavlovian drool"" a movie that confounds expectations is always welcome. Especially a movie as original and ingenious as Memento. The one word you wouldnt use for something as grim as Memento is ""fresh."" Written and directed by Christopher Nolan (based on a short story by his brother Jonathan) Memento begins with a situation familiar enough from B-films and fiction A man wakes up in a motel room with no memory of how he got there. In fact Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) has very little memory of anything except how to drive a car talk walk and try desperately to seek vengeance for his wifes rape and murder. The same crime that took his wifes life he believes also resulted in the head injury that has left him unable to store new information. Hes like a 30-year-old Alzheimers patient tracking his day in handwritten notes and Polaroid snapshots with notes attached. The movie which begins with a Polaroid shot of a corpse fading and a bullet going out of a mans body back into a gun runs backward until we and Leonard engage in a kind of narrative archeology working hand in hand to unravel the events leading up to that moment. Each scene ends precisely where the previous one begins but instead of getting increasingly tidier as it approaches its conclusion the narrative grows increasingly byzantine. As Leonard travels back and forth through the crummy rundown California suburbs of strip malls and warehouses (the movie was shot mostly in Burbank) we lurch gradually backward from one dead end to another. Though Leonard seems clear about his mission the audience quickly sees that there are things about him that dont quite add up. Guy Pearce ( The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert and L.A. Confidential) wears his hair in a platinum-blond pompadour (David Bowie circa 1984) and has the bone-thin appearance of a junkie rock star. According to his memory though hes a former insurance investigator. He dresses in fancy Italian suits drives a Jaguar and seems to have unlimited cash to throw around. His lean pale body is covered in tattoos bits of indispensable information to his investigation that he cant risk misplacing. The body in the photograph turns out to be a man who is killed in the first few minutes. As we move backward we learn that he may be a drug dealer or he may be a cop. His name is Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and each time Leonard sees him he forgets all over again who Teddy is. Like any good film noir Memento also has its femme fatale a good-looking sullen bartender named Nathalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who may be helping Leonard or using his ever-erasing mind for her own nasty purposes. To keep the audience hooked in a different kind of narrative the movie returns to a scene of Leonard (shot in black and white) talking on the phone. Hes telling someone about the significance of a tattoo on his hand that says ""Remember Sammy Jankis."" Sammy we learn was the subject of one of Leonards insurance investigations -- a man who after a head injury suffered the same sort of memory loss leading to tragic results. As the narrative grows increasingly untrustworthy the natural reaction for a viewer is to step away from the story to treat it more as a formal exercise than an emotional arc. Though its tempting to find analogies to philosophical literary heavyweights such as Jorge Luis Borges or Franz Kafka the model for Memento feels more like the interactive fiction of a computer CD-ROM game. While such a structure might raise questions about our persistent illusion of a consistent identity it doesnt raise them particularly high. Unlike for example a movie such as Exotica which tells a crime story backward to alter its emotional impact Memento always feels like an exercise in ingenuity for its own sake. By the conclusion your immediate reaction is to want to see the movie again to try to put the pieces together. Your second instinct is to give it a rest Another backward trip through Leonards bleak world is not something to which you look forward.

(Danny Rothenberg/Newmarket) ""Memento"" is so assured and daring youre almost petrified the pictures going to mess up make some kind of boneheaded move. Youre sitting there rooting for this thing not to fall off its conceptual high wire. But hallelujah it keeps its balance; and youre exhilarated from beginning to end. Or perhaps I should say from end to beginning. Christopher Nolans film is a psychological mystery about a very confused desperate man (Guy Pearce) who has lost his short-term memory. Piece by piece he tries to reassemble the psychic shards of his life; re-create the exploded jigsaw puzzle that it has become. But each day he forgets everything again. To help remember he writes notes to himself. He takes Polaroid shots of people and identifies them in writing. He has even resorted to tattooing information on his body. One of those tattoos is chilling a declaration (written backward so he can read it only in the mirror) about the rape and murder of his wife. His wife? Its hard for Leonard (thats his name we find out) to even remember her. Is she dead? Whos the killer? Little by little he recalls a brutal attack possibly by his wifes assailant. A violent blow to his head has apparently caused his memory loss. Is the killer still at large? Why is Leonard holed up in a sleazy motel in the hamburger-strip backstreets of Burbank? These and a hundred other questions ping and ricochet against the inner walls of his dysfunctional memory. Each day begins a brand new process of inquiry for Leonard. He cant tell if this is the first time or the hundredth that he has asked the motel clerk downstairs to hold his calls. And hes uncertain about Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) a stranger who keeps showing up to help him. Is he on the level? If so why has Leonard written ""Dont believe his lies"" on a Polaroid picture of him? And then theres Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) a bartender who may be his lover or his friend or just someone who needs his help. ""She has also lost someone"" Leonard writes on a snapshot of Natalie. ""She will help you out of pity."" Whats great about this film noir is the way it deconstructs time. But the structure is not arbitrary. Each new day yields more information in backward order We learn what happened in tantalizing increments. And with each revelation the big picture changes radically. Natalie has a bloody mouth for instance. She tells Leonard who did it. But is she telling the truth? As we go backward the information changes; we discover whos really responsible. This is like the thinking persons ""Groundhog Day."" Pearce so memorable as a drag queen in ""Priscilla Queen of the Desert"" and the heroic detective in ""L.A. Confidential"" is perfect here. Although hes a pretty boy - an immediate count against any authentic film-noir hero - you believe in his anguish his perplexity his waking nightmare. (""How am I supposed to heal if I cant feel time?"" he asks without even a hint of a false note.) And more important you believe in the movie which is about so much more than its attention-getting surface. This is about the selective creativity of memory; do we really remember what we remember? How much do we embellish our personal archives? What do we know for sure? ""Memento"" doesnt just draw you into a dramatic mystery it makes you aware of human mystery. And thats food for thought and entertainment. ""Memento"" (R 116 minutes) - Contains sexual situations partial nudity violence and bad language.

(Danny Rothenberg/Newmarket) You wake up one morning next to a warm body but you dont know how she got there let alone her name. It happens at least it does in the movies - even ones as perversely original as ""Memento"" a time-scrambling film noir about forgetting to remember. The tale of a sleuth with short-term memory loss it is the perfect parable for the age of Alzheimers gingko biloba and Palm Pilot Panic. British newcomer Christopher Nolan tells the story backward then doubles back again so the audience struggles with the clues along with the hero. The simple construct also gives people some sense of life from the heros frightening perspective - but its meant to overload their circuits too. Nolans theory Our memories are not to be trusted. Theyre merely temporal souvenirs. Akira Kurosawa toyed with the same notion in ""Rashomon"" the classic examination of shifting realities and self-serving motives. In Nolans movie of course the motive is the true mystery and the very last thing we learn. Based on a short story by Nolans brother the movie centers on Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) an insurance investigator who wakes up every morning and reaches for his wife but shes not there. Then it hits him all over again just the way it always does His wife was raped and murdered. . . . He doesnt know how long ago. . . . And he must track down her killer the man who cracked his skull and left him unable to ""feel time."" The motel room where Leonard lives is littered with notes scribbled on napkins and bar coasters and Polaroid pictures each with a cryptic caption like ""Teddy Dont believe his lies."" He looks into the mirror and finds his body covered with tattoos each of which represents a clue that he managed to write down before his memory faded. He cant know that the motel clerk (Mark Boone Jr.) keeps moving his stuff to smaller rooms while charging him the same rate. He repeatedly reintroduces himself and explains his ""condition"" to the clerk as well as two recurring characters who seem to be on his side a femme fatale (Carrie-Anne Moss) and the Joisey sleazoid Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Although short-term memory loss is not conducive to making friends it can be comical. In one scene Leonard is running through a trailer park when he suddenly forgets why. He sees a guy running and figures he must be chasing him but its the other way around. The films haunting subplot helpfully shot in black-and-white revolves around Leonards work for the insurance company. Hes almost as preoccupied with this memory as he is with the loss of his wife. It deals with a policy holder with short-term memory loss. The claim was denied after Leonard accused the man of fraud and well just maybe Leonard deserves what he got. The movie is unforgettable especially in Pearces startling performance. The actor who portrayed Russell Crowes crony in ""L.A. Confidential"" puts forth the bruised intensity that Brad Pitt brought to ""Fight Club."" And come to think of it that film also dealt with the modern phenomenon of not knowing who or where you are in this brave new world of Ramada Inns Pottery Barns Borders Gaps and Starbucks. ""Memento"" isnt an easy film. In fact it might be the perfect date movie for members of Mensa. It does however challenge all viewers and gives them plenty to ponder after the credits roll the lights go out and they reach the parking lot. If memory serves . . . ""Memento"" (115 minutes) is rated R for violence language and drugs.

"Memento Stretches Beyond The Usual Suspense Thriller - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs REVIEW.Memento Stretches Beyond The Usual Suspense ThrillerApril 13 2001|By Mark Caro Tribune movie reporter.""Memento"" is a thriller for people who are sick of thrillers a puzzle movie in which the puzzle is actually worth the time and effort to solve.Suspense movies of late have been anything but suspenseful. The lead character faces some mystery travels down right and wrong paths gets doublecrossed in an out-of-nowhere ""surprise"" and winds up in a chase in which the villain ultimately buys the farm.Young British writer-director Christopher Nolan (""Following"") turns the formula on its head with ""Memento."" In its first scene the supposed hero guns down his prey and then the movie works backward to show you how he got to that point.Turns out that Leonard (Guy Pearce) our man on a mission is suffering from a ""condition"" that as he explains to the same people over and over prevents him from creating any new memories. He can remember everything up to the point his wife was killed but since then his short-term memory has been non-functional so each time he meets someone its as if the person is a stranger. Fifteen minutes is about his limit for maintaining a clear line of thought.The reverse-order flashbacks are Nolans way of letting us share at least some of Leonards point of view. When Leonard meets a woman named Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) in a diner he has no idea who she is and neither do we. Only as we move back in time do we realize how essential her role is.Its remarkable that Nolan is able to build such suspense based on our finding out what already has happened. We know where all of this action is leading -- to Leonard pumping lead through the head of an enigmatic guy named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano).Obsessed with finding his wifes killer Leonard tries to keep the clues straight through an elaborate system of taking Polaroid pictures of key people and locations and writing himself notes and tattooing important pieces of information on his body. This way when someone arrives supposedly to help him he can check the persons identity on the photo and read his own handwritten caption ""Dont believe his lies.""Nevertheless Leonard is a renegade gumshoe (we learn that he once was an insurance investigator) in an almost constant state of confusion. All of a sudden hes running from someone firing a gun or hes waking up next to someone and having no idea why. In a sense Leonard is living a prolonged version of those paranoid moments almost everyone experiences at some point -- where you feel like everyone in the room knows whats going on but you.As he did as Lt. Exley in ""L.A. Confidential"" the Australian Pearce immerses himself so deeply in his role that he erases viewer memories of having seen him on screen previously.With his finely carved cheekbones and sleek build Pearce could have made Leonard into a straight-ahead action hero but the actor counterbalances any sense of bravura with an undercurrent of puppy-dog vulnerability and shifty-eyed edginess.Serving as Leonards foil much of the time is Pantolianos Teddy a good-humored fast-talking character who actually bears little resemblance to Pantolianos other fast-talking characters like Ralphie on ""The Sopranos."" Youre not sure whether the beefy-mustached simpatico-seeming Teddy is around to help or hinder Leonard. In contrast the porcelain-featured Moss maintains an air of cool reserve which the movie uses to good effect.Mixed in with the reverse-order flashbacks are black-and-white scenes showing Leonard on the phone discussing the puzzling case of Sammy Jenkins (Stephen Tobolowski) a man who suffered from a similar ""condition."" These forward and backward elements come together by the end to explain what really happened.At least you think they do. The key to a puzzle movie is the feeling that everything ultimately fits together even if you couldnt instantly articulate how. As satisfying as ""The Usual Suspects"" is I dont think the plot actually passes the credibility test; why would the villain go to all that trouble?Im convinced however that ""Memento"" makes sense even though Ive seen it twice and still havent figured out how to place a final few pieces inside the frame.Because Nolan has done such a fine job of making sure his revelations and jokes have impact he can trust that his audience will want to do some of the mental heavy lifting. The mystery -- and Nolan has given his movie the perfect last line -- isnt just what lies behind the narrative gimmick but also the mystery of how people selectively construct the narratives of their own lives. Like Leonard viewers may find themselves uncontrollably driven to examining the clues over and over.`MEMENTO(star)(star)(star)1/2Written and directed by Christopher Nolan; based on the short story Jonathan Nolan; photographed by Wally Pfister; edited by Dody Dorn; production designed by Patti Podesta; music by David Julian; produced by Jennifer Todd amp; Suzanne Todd.

Bush U.S. Military al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden gt; Advanced Search Short Takes B O O K S TROUBLEMAKER AND OTHER SAINTS By Christina Chiu The hand-over of Hong Kong to mainland China is a relatively minor event among the emotional cataclysms in this short-story debut. Chiu refracts classic old-vs.-new-world tensions through the prism of second-generation Chinese-American Gen-Xers inspired more by Kurt Cobain than by Buddha. The resulting chasm between the Chinese Americans and their immigrant parents is filled with disappointments with tales of anorexia and homophobia and that stubborn reluctance by young and old to see each other as each wishes to be seen. BY LISE FUNDERBURG C I N E M A ENEMY AT THE GATES Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud In the Battle of Stalingrad a sharpshooting shepherd (Jude Law) picks off dozens of Germans. So the Nazis send their best sniper (Ed Harris) to kill the killer. Not so much a war movie as a western with a shoot-out every 10 minutes Enemy is the big puffy drama we expect from the director of Quest for Fire and The Lover. Theres a stolid almost Stalinist cast to the compositions and a drably desaturated palette--apparently Russia was so poor in the 40s that it couldnt afford full color. But Law sexy and crafty as ever and here with a flinty innocence proves again he has the star-quality goods. BY RICHARD CORLISS MEMENTO Directed by Christopher Nolan Traumatized by his wifes rape-murder Leonard (Guy Pearce) loses all short-term memory. Investigating her death he takes Polaroids of everyone he meets. But his condition prevents him from constructing a coherent account of a day in his life let alone the crime in question. The film takes this attempt to shatter narrative into little pieces about as far into incoherence as it can go; yet it is also full of odd hypnotic menace.

He shoots someone and the bullet goes back into the chamber. A photograph in his hand begins to fade rather than develop. For Shelby the cause is the effect; the beginning is the end. Fortunately the action in ""Memento"" goes truly backward only for a few minutes. For the rest of the movie the scenes are merely in reverse order with the beginning of the story coming at the films conclusion. We know what happens and spend the rest of the movie trying to figure out why. With ""Memento"" writer and director Christopher Nolan creates an ambitious storyline about people with ambiguous loyalties and a long-ago rape and murder that propels it all. While there are many great moments in this film at times it feels like the cinematic equivalent of pig Latin - an elaborate game you wish theyd play straight. Beginning to end from review this reading imagine. Shelby (Guy Pearce) has no short-term memory. Its been gone since he was whacked on the head while trying to stop two men from murdering his wife. He can remember everything until that attack. His purpose in life is to avenge his wifes death which comes back to him piecemeal in dreams and flashbacks. This is a gimmick movie. And as a film that relies on not one but two gimmicks - the man with no memory and a story in reverse - Nolan has to take so much time connecting the threads of his story that the action drags through much of the middle. Once the idea of the tricks settles in ""Memento"" becomes less a fascinating portrait of a damaged man than a typical revenge thriller. But its still a very cool movie. ""Memento""    With Guy Pearce Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan. 116 minutes. Egyptian Theater. Rated R for violence language and some drug content. For more information visit www.otnemem.com. So he can function Shelby writes himself scores of notes tattoos facts on his body and takes lots of photos. He keeps a Polaroid of his Jaguar of a woman named Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) of a bloody man with duct tape over his mouth of his hotel and of Teddy a guy Shelby doesnt trust played to weaselly perfection by Joe Pantoliano. Using these bits he tries to find the murderer. More interesting than the mystery of ""Memento"" is watching Pearce wrestle with his characters situation. When he wakes up he forgets his wife is dead rolls over to her side of the bed and mourns anew. When you cant remember what you did 10 minutes ago time - and its way of defining our lives - starts to lose meaning. As he says toward the end of the film ""We all need memories to remind ourselves of who we are."" ""Memento"" can be very funny dealing with what Shelby calls his ""condition"" but too often ""Memento"" plays loose with its own rules stretching and shrinking Shelbys memory to fit the plot making the movie feel more like a puzzle than a story. But thats kind of the way Shelbys life really is. Maybe without memories and the connections they bring the only thing thats left are the details. And as Shelby himself realizes the details never tell the whole story.

Starring Guy Pearce Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano. Directed and written by Christopher Nolan. (VHS and DVD. R. 116 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) ""Memento"" directed by 30-year-old British director Christopher Nolan is the kind of movie thats bound to be talked about debated and eviscerated far more than its understood. Its the story of a man played by Australian actor Guy Pearce whose short- term memory is destroyed when his wife is killed. After the tragedy Leonard Shelby compensates by taking Polaroids making notes to himself and tattooing reminders on his body -- anything to reorganize his shattered life and avenge his wifes death. Its not amnesia he explains but anterograde memory loss -- the inability to make new memories. Everything until the accident is relatively intact; everything that has happened since tends to vanish. Nolan based ""Memento"" on a short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan who told it to him during a cross-country road trip. He sets it in Los Angeles -- the tawdry L.A. not the glamorous one -- and uses the story as a springboard to various themes the relativity of truth the unreliability of memory and the existential loneliness of a man who constantly feels ""like I just woke up."" Thats a weighty agenda all by itself but Nolan adds another layer by telling Leonards story in reverse. He opens the film with a Polaroid of a murdered man and during the opening credits lets that image fade to nothing. A murder is then revealed (or cloaked?) and each scene that follows clicks backward in time ending roughly where the previous one began. Shady L.A. characters played by Carrie-Anne Moss Joe Pantoliano and Mark Boone Jr. will enter Leonards world appearing friendly one moment and reeking of malice in another. ""Memento"" is told from Leonards fractured perspective so its hard to follow -- intentionally so. Like ""The Sixth Sense"" which also played with motions of time and perception its designed to challenge and confound us. Like ""The Sixth Sense"" it begs for repeated viewings and gives us (what seems to be) a surprise ending. Ive seen it twice now and Im still not sure exactly what happens. And Im wondering Will anyone? Advisory This movie contains raw violence raw language and partial nudity. Todays Deals Samsung 65"" Curved 4K Smart TV 400 Dell GC for 1500 + free...

Think The Big Clock with Ray Milland attempting to solve a murder when every clue points back at him as the guilty party; think D.O.A. with Edmund OBrien desperately looking for the culprit who has given him a slow-acting lethal poison.And now think Leonard Shelby (wiry Australian actor Pearce - the upright ambitious spectacle-wearing detective of L.A. Confidential).As Memento begins Leonard is a blank slate albeit a bloody one Hes got bruises and cuts indicative of a violent struggle but because of a blow to his head he has no recollection of the circumstances or the combatant(s).An insurance investigator by trade he knows how to do some sleuthing - the problem is that because he cant hang on to any of his memories in the aftermath of the injury he is in effect clueless. So he takes Polaroids of people and places quickly scrawling notes and numbers on them; he even has cautionary messages tattooed across his body (""Consider the source. . . . Memory is treachery"" reads one running across his right bicep) many of them in reverse image so he can scan them fast in the mirror.Nolan has crafted Mementos narrative backward like a completed puzzle whose pieces are removed one by one fragmenting the image. Its a densely layered circular exercise in deja vu - a gimmick yes but one that resonates - and it demands keen attention from the viewer. Theres work to be done here to keep up with poor memo-riddled Leonard in his search for an explanation in search of revenge.A couple of cast members from The Matrix - the androgynous acrobatic Carrie-Anne Moss and the weasely Joe Pantoliano (currently making trouble on The Sopranos) - show up to make Leonards life even more disorienting. Moss is a mysterious bartender Pantoliano a gum-smacking stranger with a dubious agenda. Our forgetful hero (is Memento really a meditation on Alzheimers?) is placed in a position where he has to trust or distrust these characters - no mean feat when he cant be certain of his own instincts and motives.If in the end - or the beginning as it were - Mementos pieces dont all fall seamlessly into place (and Im still not sure whether they do) it doesnt really matter. Raymond Chandler himself declared that he had no idea who was responsible for the murder in The Big Sleep and that hardly diminishes his books (and the Bogart-Bacall movies) accomplishments. Nolan has pulled off a deft dizzying thriller that will stay in your head for a long time or at least until your own short-term memory goes scarily blank.Steven Reas e-mail address is sreaphillynews.com.Memento  1/2Produced by Jennifer Todd and Suzanne Todd written and directed by Christopher Nolan photography by Wally Pfister music by David Julian distributed by Newmarket Films.Running time 1 hour 45 mins.Leonard. . .

This provocative thriller starts in reverse. Somebodys just been murdered. Now were watching a freshly snapped photograph of the scene ""un-develop"" fading fading fading until its gone. If that seems too arty and self-conscious for its own good just wait. The movie settles down a bit though not much. At least scenes stop running in reverse. The order still is skewed but this almost makes sense given that we experience the world largely through the gaze of a man with no short-term memory. Leonard Shelby cant tell whether hes coming or going. And neither can we. The woman sitting across the Formica diner table from him -- did he sleep with her last night or did they just meet? And the oily little guy who keeps coming around claiming he wants to help ... Whats his story? Is he a cop like he says or is he the animal who raped and killed Leonards wife? Wiry and wired Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential; Rules of Engagement; Priscilla Queen of the Desert) stars as Leonard the insurance investigator who suffered a brain injury the night his wife was attacked. The police wont help him so hes trying to track down her killer on his own. Parts of this movie are laugh-out-loud funny and yet its not a comedy. At least thats not all it is. The spine of Memento is the murder mystery and the brilliance of writer-director Christopher Nolans creation is that the movies form is as thrilling as the story it tells. (He adapted the script from a short story his brother wrote that appears in the March issue of Esquire.) The film may be a bit overlong but its intensity is unrelenting. Even told in reverse-chronological order it has a freight trains momentum. Its like The Big Clock or D.O.A. crossed with Last Year at Marianbad. Who did kill Leonards wife? Was it the cop played by Joe Pantoliano? Maybe Leonard killed her and doesnt remember. Or maybe its all a delusion and she wasnt killed at all. The mysteries pile up. How can they not? Everythings a mystery to Leonard. He takes photographs of every important person and place. And hes always jotting down notes. The most important notes he tattoos into his skin. But whats he to make of the words ""Dont Believe His Lies"" scribbled under a snapshot when he cant recall why he wrote them? Whenever Leonard meets someone new he has to explain about his ""condition."" But since everyone he meets is new to him he explains a dozen times a day usually over and over again to the same people. One of the most exciting -- and hilarious -- scenes has him running either fleeing or chasing a man with a gun. Suddenly in the middle of the action he cant remember which. He doesnt even remember the gun until the guy starts shooting. Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix Chocolat) plays a bartender whose boyfriend who has vanished was involved in drugs. She either is helping Leonard or using him -- he doesnt know. And for a long time the audience doesnt know either. Wisely Nolan doesnt belabor the philosophical implications of Leonards conundrum. He doesnt have to. Its there for us to see and ponder or ignore as we wish. If The Sixth Sense was a film that rewarded a second viewing Memento may warrant a third. Think of it as the antidote to the mediocrities celebrated at the just-ended Academy Awards. If Memento doesnt quickly become a hot topic of conversation around your office water cooler change jobs.

"USATODAY.com - Memento plays a good mind game Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 05/22/2001 - Updated 0305 PM ET Memento plays a good mind game By Mike Clark USA TODAY Memento (out of four) Stars Guy Pearce Carrie- Anne Moss Joe Pantoliano Mark Boone Jr. Stephen Tobolowski Director Christopher Nolan Distributor Newmarket Rating R for violence language and some drug content Memento is a terrifically compelling little mystery about short-term memory loss though proceed at your own risk if youre burdened with the same affliction. The narrative is so dense that youd be better off in Recess Schools Out or something else less brainy. Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential) keeps the mind hopping throughout with his characters ordeal. Appearing in nearly every scene Pearce works a vague urban landscape as an insurance investigator trying to figure out who raped and murdered his beloved wife. Hindering his sleuthing is the fact that he got clobbered on the head during the same incident and he cant remember anything that has happened since. Even events that occurred 10 seconds earlier. Read more Video Memento trailer Writer/director Christopher Nolan drawing from a short story by his brother Jonathan comes up with a nifty narrative equivalent of Pearces sorry state. He tells the story backward which means the viewers mind is just as challenged as Pearces. Nolan deftly stokes the dark humor inherent in the situation without being cruel about it. In one frenzied chase scene Pearce suddenly cant remember whether hes chasing a gun-packing adversary or whether the guy is chasing him. And Pearce doesnt realize a sleazy hotel desk clerk is double dipping into his wallet by renting him double rooms. Anticipating these problems Pearce annotates Polaroids of new acquaintances and tattoos reminders on his body to such an extent thats hes almost starting to look like Queequeg in Moby-Dick. There is nothing like being on the phone and reading a warning to yourself ""Dont pick up the phone."" Carrie-Anne Moss (as a bartender) and Joe Pantoliano (as well were kept wondering for the duration) match Pearce with crucial supporting performances. The result has the unanticipated craft and artfully ambiguous appeal of last years Croupier a movie whose art-house word-of-mouth success could be duplicated here. Still if the eventual DVD includes a supplemental version that tells this story in chronological order its a memento bound to be welcomed by viewers with minds both foggy and sharp.

"Forward to the Past Slate Sign In Sign Up Forward to the Past Forward to the Past Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 16 2001 300 AM Forward to the Past Memento begins with a killer ending; Enemy at the Gates cant even shoot straight. By David Edelstein Most thrillers aim at a place so much lower than the brain that when a bonafide synapse-tickler like Memento comes along you might feel like popping a bottle of champagne--partly to celebrate partly to calm those anxious gray cells. Its scary to have to puzzle out a plot line scene by scene--scary and exhilarating at least for an hour. The movie directed by 30-year-old Englishman Christopher Nolan (adapted from a short story by his brother Jonathan) is film noir by way of Oliver Sacks. Its obviously not the first mystery to use amnesia as a hook but it might be the cleverest at concocting a cinematic syntax to mimic its protagonists peculiar neurological malady. In most mysteries youre dying to know what happens next. In this one you can hardly wait for the beginning. Advertisement Let me explain. No--let me enhance your obfuscation. The protagonist Leonard (Guy Pearce) has little in the way of short-term memory. At odd intervals--every few hours or sometimes every 15 minutes--he finds himself in a new present the previous slate having been wiped clean. He knows (he thinks) his name and previous occupation that his beloved wife (seen in flashbacks) was raped and murdered and that in the course of that crime he received an injury to the brain such that no more memories can accumulate. He knows his purpose in life is to hunt down and kill his wifes murderer. If the director were to follow Leonard from one episode (one fleeting unit of memory) to the next then we in the audience would know everything he has forgotten. Wed be many steps ahead of him--and boringly oriented. But the gimmick of Memento is that the damned thing goes backward. Well backward and then forward like a recurrent temporal hiccup. The syntax doesnt mirror Leonards mind exactly but it does result in our not knowing along with Leonard why hes sitting in a given place at a given time. The foundation of memory is missing. The movie isnt a whodunnit but a whydhedoit the suspense of each new scene pegged to Leonard quickly reading the situation and reorienting himself--quite a challenge in say mid-car-chase. Leonard does have some help. He has taken Polaroids and scribbled captions on them--messages to himself from the past. Some have the names of important people like the dark and spiky Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) or the inexplicably chummy Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). More enduring nuggets of wisdom are tattooed all over his torso. And if the narrative line isnt zigzaggy enough theres a sort of intermittent parallel plot in which Leonard recounts (over the phone to an unseen listener) the tale of Sammy (Stephen Tobolowsky) a man with a similar neurological condition. In his previous life as an insurance investigator Leonard was apparently less than empathetic--which either suggests that his current affliction is poetic justice or that the story itself is a fabrication the product of an addled psyches search for meaning. Whats to be gained by plotting a mystery in reverse? It turns us into historians combing the present for clues to the past and then finding--when we actually visit that past--that our interpretations were wrong. We didnt get it--we didnt see. Memento opens with a Polaroid of the dead Teddy which then un-develops and is sucked back into the camera. The blood un-splatters Teddy falls up the bullet returns to Leonards gun. Throughout the movie our thoughts come back to that act of violence Who we need to know is Teddy really and why does Leonard have to kill him? Did he rape and murder Leonards wife or has Leonard been set up--maybe by that fatale-looking femme Natalie? The question has an urgency bordering on the existential. ""I have to believe in a world outside my mind"" says Leonard in voice-over his words underscored by David Julians tingling strings. ""I have to believe that my actions have meaning even if I dont remember them."" When a full explanation comes its momentarily irritating--our vigilante preconceptions go out the window--and then on reflection a great morbid joke. Advertisement Not all of Memento is as tantalizing as its premise. Theres a monotony to the pattern of jump back plod forward jump back plod forward During the second half I thought the beginning would never come. And Pearce isnt an especially likable protagonist--his handsomeness is bland and faintly smug. Pearce makes it easy to identify with Natalies annoyance at Leonard and the terrifically intense Carrie-Anne Moss gets to play a scene of startling nastiness. She taunts Leonard with an abandon that comes from knowing he wont remember a word. Her rant has an eerie resonance since in my experience women are often driven crazy by mens self-servingly selective memories. How often Ive wished I could stammer ""Honey its not my fault. Its this darn frontal lobe ..."" The story of the movie Enemy at the Gates occupies only a few stirring pages of William Craigs classic 1973 account (with the same title) of the battle of Stalingrad. The 1942 siege itself was one of the most horrific of the 20th century with casualties exceeding a million and grotesque inhumanity on all sides. (The Nazis and the Soviets both committed their share of atrocities.) In the middle of the mass carnage though was a B-movie-worthy duel between two super-snipers. Vassili Zaitsev a handsome shepherd from the Urals had become a Soviet folk hero for his ability to drop his targets with a single shot--to the point where the Third Reich dispatched a Bavarian aristocrat named Konings whose objective was to trap and kill this one man. The film directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud doesnt stint on mud corpses or rubble but the focus is all screwed-up. Someone must have thought the story of Zaitsev (played by Jude Law) his sniper-lover Tania (Rachel Weisz) and a political agitator called Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) would make a terrific Titanic-style love triangle; that the spattery battle scenes would win over the Saving Private Ryan audience; and that the cat-and-mouse struggle between the earnest blond hero and the icy Nazi (here called Konig and played by Ed Harris) would be the neatest thing this side of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul. Annaud does well with the sniper scenes--long tense watches ended by the crack of a rifle and the explosion of someones head or chest. But he doesnt have a clue how to dramatize the romance. Fiennes whose eyes are extremely close together stares with a mixture of rage and longing at Weisz whose eyes are extremely far apart and the film turns into The Dating Game designed by Picasso. The Russians talk in English and the Germans talk in German except when Ed Harris shows up and then everyone talks in English. Skinny neurotically clipped British actors give each other hearty Russian bear hugs. If Enemy at the Gates were going to work Annaud would have had to set up some kind of ironic relationship between the hundreds of thousands of people dying randomly and the almost absurdly focused mano-a-mano fight-to-the-finish between the rival sharpshooters. But the director who has no ear for dialogue and tends to think in cloddishly huge cinematic statements seems oblivious to the abrupt shifts in scale. When one sniper finally takes out the other he doesnt even bother to show how the rest of the battle turned out. The lovers clutch each other and seem on the verge of sighing ""Well always have Stalingrad."" David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

BACK TO THE FUTURE By Lou Lumenick View author archive email the author follow on twitter Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) March 16 2001 | 500am MEMENTO ( 1/2) An amnesiacs unforgettable adventures - with a great twist. Running time 116 minutes. Rated R (violence profanity). At the Lincoln Plaza the 19th St. East the Angelika others. ------- CHRISTOPHER Nolans brilliant thriller ""Memento"" is one movie where you dont have to worry about giving away the ending - its in the stunning opening sequence. Leonard (Guy Pearce) is seen holding a Polaroid photo of a bloodied body in an alleyway - and as we watch the film rewinds and we see the picture ""undevelop"" and pop back into the camera all the way to the point where we see Leonard shoot a shady character named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Why? The answer requires paying rather close attention to the scenes that follow which play out normally - except theyre shown in reverse chronological order with the beginning of the movie being shown last and the first scene at the end. Interspersed are black-and-white sequences of Leonard by himself in a seedy California motel where the clerk has taken advantage of his condition by renting him two rooms. This is a gimmick thats been used before by everyone from Harold Pinter (""Betrayal"") to a notorious episode of ""Seinfeld."" But it may never have been deployed as effectively since it cleverly simulates the hellish existence of Leonard who suffers from severe short-term memory loss. Leonard remembers everything up to the point where his wife was raped and murdered and he was hit over the head. After that he can retain memories for only about the length of a TV commercial. Its so bad that during a chase in an alleyway he pauses momentarily - perplexed because he doesnt recall whether hes chasing someone or being chased. Leonard tries to keep things straight by writing himself notes tattooing reminders on his body and taking Polaroid photos of everyone he meets since he wont remember meeting them no matter how many times he encounters them. ""She will help you out of pity"" he scrawls on a picture of Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss) who is not above exploiting poor Leonards condition on more than one occasion. Leonard is ill equipped to figure out whether Teddy is a cop a crook and/or his wifes killer. Under the circumstances hes not even sure whether hes already dealt with the killer. Or whether the vivid stories he tells about another victim of short-term loss (Stephen Tobolowsky) are real or a delusion. Leonard who does remember he was an insurance adjuster just cant explain why hes wearing a hand-tailored European suit and has loads of cash. With its nonlinear narrative ""Memento"" somewhat recalls ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Chinatown"" both of which also subverted the conventions of film noir with terrific elan and superb performances. Sporting blond hair and a flawless American accent Pearce digs deeply into Leonards confusion and delivers his best performance since the twisty ""L.A. Confidential"" which was easy to follow by comparison. Its a tour de force by writer-director Nolan who adapted a short story by his brother Jonathan. This demanding puzzle is not for the ""Chocolat"" crowd but those who stay with it will experience perhaps the most dazzling film released so far this year - even though a second viewing is virtually mandatory.

Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Thrillers Entertainment News In the climax of the art-noir ""Memento"" Guy Pearce as a man suffering short-term memory loss investigating the murder of his wife kills Joe Pantoliano playing his assistant after coming to believe that Pantoliano is the real killer. Now before you howl that Ive given the movie away I should tell you that all Ive done is describe the first two or three minutes. The climax you see comes at the beginning and that I can reveal it without having to worry about spoiling anything should give you an idea of just how much emotional involvement you can expect watching it. Like Harold Pinters ""Betrayal"" and Atom Egoyans ""Exotica"" Christopher Nolans ""Memento"" is told backwards from end to beginning. Theres no denying its cleverness. Its probably the cleverest use yet of that essentially stupid device. Ive heard all sorts of arguments for reverse storytelling the most frequent being that it allows you to watch a scene and the interactions of the characters without any preconceptions. I dont buy it. Theres something basically nonsensical about asking an audience to watch a scene without any of the background information or emotional history that would allow them to respond to whats going on. It might be wonderful for people who like to come in on the middle of movies and its a great way of discussing ""tropes"" and what have you but as a way of telling a story its a bust. ""Memento"" has gotten extraordinary advance reviews and part of that praise is due no doubt to its being a puzzle movie. From ""Last Year in Marienbad"" on puzzle movies have almost always been presumed to be hiding great depths. But by the time ""Memento"" disappears up its own existence you might suspect that its told backwards because telling it forwards would tip us off much sooner that it doesnt make a whole lot of sense. For roughly the first hour though Nolan almost pulls it off. Since mysteries show us things before we can make sense of them Nolans method makes a kind of sense; he sustains our desire to see what happens at a low steady simmer. His detective is Leonard Shelby (Pearce) a former insurance investigator whose short-term memory has been decimated since finding his wife raped and murdered. He can focus in chunks of about 15 minutes. After that no matter how many times hes met someone its as if hes meeting them for the first time. To help him remember he takes Polaroids of people and places with relevant information jotted down on the back. And hes turned his body into a giant memo pad with the important clues hes discovered tattooed on his flesh. The catch of course is that he relies on any information that hes written down as gospel. He cant process anything he learns later on that might contradict it. Nolan has structured the film in short bursts that are roughly equal to Leonards attention span. We watch a scene and then the next scene (which has actually taken place previous to what weve already seen) annotates what we just saw. The method offers a few genuine shocks particularly in scenes involving Carrie-Anne Moss as a woman Leonard trusts because she too has lost someone to violence. (The problem is that the shocks involving her character also reduce the role to that noir cliche the cunning femme fatale bitch.) But for the most part the plot only gets more confusing as it opens up and puts us in the position of feeling less and less sympathy for Pearce. Its easy to spot the movies that Nolan is referencing here John Boormans ""Point Blank"" and Steven Soderberghs ""The Limey"" with their fractured narratives and seedy views of Los Angeles. And unless Im mistaken hes also taken time to study ""Groundhog Day"" with its constant repetition of scenes each repetition adding something that advances the story. You Might Also Like Except that here of course the point is to retard the story. ""Memento"" isnt so much a shrinking closet as one of those old-fashioned reducing machines. Everything from your comprehension of the story to your interest in it shrinks as the picture goes on. And it seems to me that if the meaning and impact of a story depends solely on being cut up and rejiggered that if telling it in the usual order would render it trite or prevent our having an emotional stake in it then the material isnt very good to begin with. If ""Memento"" were some sort of literary deconstruction about how in detective stories the quest is more important to the detective than solving the mystery it would probably get top marks. You can watch Pearce tracking down his incomplete information not even knowing who hes going after or even why and come up with a whole riff on the existential subtext of detective fiction how it functions as a metaphor for going through the motions of everyday life. (The French will have a field day with it.) But all that is cold comfort to an audience thats been promised a mystery with a solution. There is a solution of sorts but one that feels like a cheat because instead of being solved the mystery evaporates before our eyes. ""Memento"" might have postponed being revealed as a cold exercise if the filmmakers had cast someone other than Guy Pearce in the lead. All I could get from Pearce in ""L.A. Confidential"" was a stiff actor playing a dullard straight-arrow whose conflicts didnt go deep enough to seem interesting. Here done up in a shock of spiky dyed-blond hair and various creepy tattoos (designed it would appear after Robert De Niro in ""Cape Fear"") hes a blank not even a man tormentedly trying to recover his past. Hes so affectless that being a blank seems what he aspires to. The loss of short-term memory is his fulfillment. Its curious that after laying out such a meticulous puzzle Christopher Nolan introduces the booby trap that detonates the surrounding material namely Stephen Tobolowsky and Harriet Sansom Harris as the couple from an insurance investigation that haunts Pearce. Tobolowsky is a man whos unable to continue working when he develops the same short-term memory loss that Pearce eventually suffers from. Pearce working to save his company money prevents Tobolowsky from getting covered for his ailment and the poor mans wife is left wondering whether her husband is faking. Harris captures the escalating desperation of someone trying to hold onto a normal life as the floor is kicked out from beneath her and Tobolowsky gives perhaps his best performance. Hes one of those actors whose face you know even if you dont recognize his name. He was the jeweler who deflects Annette Benings advances in the most gentlemanly manner possible in ""The Grifters""; he was one of the CBS lawyers working to kill Russell Crowes ""60 Minutes"" appearance in ""The Insider""; and he was Ned Ryerson the insurance agent who kept pestering former classmate Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day."" With the fringe of hair around his bald head and his big eyes and tall build Tobolowsky could be Homer Simpsons basketball-playing cousin. He plays this role with the calm of a man who has entered the serenity of dementia; the lost benign little smile on his face becomes more heartrending as the movie goes on. Whenever Harris or Tobolowsky come on-screen they stop ""Memento"" dead in its clever tracks. You want to tell Nolan to stop all the po-mo deconstructive game playing and pay attention to the two human beings in front of him. Charles Taylor is a columnist for the Newark Star-Ledger.

"Backward Unreels the Thriller - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Backward Unreels the ThrillerMemento a gripping puzzle about a man whose memory fails him rises above most noir.March 16 2001|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC ""Memento"" Latin for remember means a reminder of the past something that can be used to prod the memory or warn about the future. Which makes it an apt and poignant title for writer-director Christopher Nolans exceptional new film a haunting nervy thriller about a man who can remember nothing at all.That would be Leonard Shelby (compellingly played by ""L.A. Confidentials"" Guy Pearce) a former insurance investigator with a peculiar and devastating mental condition; a blow to the head as he was grappling with the men who raped and murdered his wife cost him the ability to create short-term memories.So while Leonard can recall everything up to that brutal moment nothing more recent stays in his head for more than a few fleeting minutes. He wakes up in rooms and cant remember where he is or why hes there. He finds himself in chases not knowing if hes the hunter or the prey. Even such simple questions as ""They treating you OK?"" get a frank ""I dont remember"" as a response.Ordinary life would be daunting enough with this handicap but Leonard is after something more. Determined to avenge his wifes death desperate for certainties that no longer exist he has become a kind of defective detective obsessively focused on seeing justice done even though he wont be able to retain its memory should it happen. ""Just because there are things I dont remember"" he insists ""doesnt make my actions meaningless.""""Mementos"" intriguing premise is adapted from a short story by Nolans brother Jonathan which was in turn based on a real condition called anterograde memory loss which Oliver Sacks among others has written about. Nolan has retained his interest in the nature of identity and the fracturing of time that characterized his first feature the unnerving ""Following"" and added riffs on the possibility and meaning of revenge.More than a film of ideas however ""Memento"" is a provocatively structured and thrillingly executed film noir an intricate inventive use of cinemas possibilities that pushes what can be done on screen in an unusual direction.Intent on telling the story subjectively in a way that mirrors Leonards point of view Nolan in effect constructed a despairing backward thriller a film that starts at the end (a bit like Harold Pinters ""Betrayal"") and works its way back to the beginning. Yet paradoxically the more we find out the more pieces we can identify the less we can be sure just what the truth is.""Memento"" begins with a scene that encapsulates what is to come. A man is looking at a just-developed Polaroid picture of a corpse. Suddenly the photo starts to undevelop and goes back into the camera the bullet goes back into the gun and the victim is alive and talking. In a similar way the films plot line moves backward from that corpse on the floor to reveal the series of events that led to its being there.Polaroids it turns out are one of the keys to Leonards life. Theyre the only way he can remember what cheap motel hes staying in and when combined with what hes written on the backs of the photos theyre his only clue to who he knows and what he knows about them.There is for instance the effusive inscrutable Teddy (""The Matrixs"" Joe Pantoliano) who seems to understand more about Leonard than the man does himself. And the femme fatale barmaid Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss also a ""Matrix"" veteran) is another enigmatic character; on the back of her photo are the words ""She will help you out of pity.""Most provocatively Leonard has key information stuff he cannot afford to forget tattooed on his body some of it backward so it can be read in a mirror. Theres also room on his body for chilling aphorisms such as ""Consider the Source"" ""Memory Is Treachery"" and the potent ""Find Him and Kill Him.""In a series of monologues spoken to an unknown person on the telephone Leonard reveals that much of how he interfaces with the world his discipline and his organization are the result of insights gained during his insurance investigation of the case of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky) a man with a condition very similar to his own.We learn this as we learn everything else in fragments. For in addition to telling the story backward Nolan makes use of an ingenious narrative structure. ""Mementos"" every scene starts the way it does for Leonard with a sense of ""where am I"" confusion. But after throwing us into the middle of things the film in effect takes a step back showing us the context for the action weve just seen in effect giving us the information Leonard has forgotten.This is a storytelling method that not only rewards but demands the closest kind of attention and Nolan himself has said that though he has an excellent visual memory and has seen his film about a thousand times ""if I walk into a screening when the films been on for 20 minutes even I dont know what scene is coming next.""1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview The Dark Knight Rises more than shines and on...July 19 2012Oscar oversights include some Hollywood heavyweightsJanuary 26 2011Inception breaks into dreamsApril 4 2010Theyve got something up their sleevesOctober 20 2006Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/16/entertainment/ca-38285,200,memento26,memento,latimes

He lives in a perpetual present tense his mind rewinding over and over in an endless loop a movement reflected in the obsessive architecture of the film itself which is literally structured backward. As Leonard tracks his investigation employing a series of Polaroid photographs and body tattoos hes like a man trying to wrap his mind around the question mark of his own identity. Memento has a spooky repetitive urgency that takes on the clarity of a dream; its like an Oliver Sacks case study played as malevolent film noir. Pearce frantic and disheveled lends even the smallest events the aura of a life-or-death search a quest for meaning.

"Memento | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; memento ) Memento (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Memory - it is one of the key elements that separates human beings from animals. It is one of the basic building blocks of personality. Who we are is shaped as much by our experiences as by our environment. Memory can also be unreliable not to mention easily influenced. Ask three people to describe the same event and none of those accounts will be the same. But although memories are skewed by perspective they are critical to the human experience. Memento is very much concerned with all aspects of memory especially the manipulation of it and this endlessly fascinating wonderfully open-ended motion picture will be remembered by many who see it as one of the best films of the year. When I initially saw Memento at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival where it played in competition I recognized this as a shoo-in for a spot on my years end Top 10 list. Theres no way this film could miss. Had it been released last year it would have landed in the 1 or 2 position (right ahead of or behind Requiem for a Dream). This is a great motion picture and as an added bonus it has a tremendous ""replayability"" meaning that subsequent viewings are almost as rewarding as the first. The only downside is that with a small distributor like Newmarket Capital Group it may be difficult to find especially for those who dont live near major metropolitan areas. Memento stars Austalian actor Guy Pearce (one of the crossdressers in The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert and the ""straight"" guy L.A. Confidential) as Leonard Shelby a former insurance investigator and crime victim who is trying to find the man who raped and murdered his wife (Jorja Fox). His goal is simple - he wants revenge through execution. Nothing less will satisfy him. But theres a small matter that complicates Leonards investigation. He has no short term memory. During the attack that ended his wifes life Leonard suffered brain damage. Now although his long-term memory is fine he cant remember any recent events. He can meet the same person a hundred times and wont know their name or who they are. To combat his condition Leonard relies upon a series of annotated Polaroid snapshots - not exactly the ideal tool by which to seek out a killer who even the police cant locate. Along the way Leonard is aided (or perhaps hindered) by the ubiquitous Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who is always on hand to offer advice and he becomes involved with the mysterious Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss) whose motives may not be as straightforward as they initially appear to be. Memento doesnt stop with a great premise. In fact what really distinguishes this film is its brilliant innovative structure. Nolan has elected to tell the story backwards. He starts at the end and finishes near the beginning. The main narrative is presented as a series of three-to-eight minute segments each of which ends where the previous one began. A second thread which starts at an unspecified time in the past and moves forward to intersect with the main storyline is used to buffer the ""reverse"" segments as well as to provide background information. (It also tells the important ""Sammy Jankis"" story which becomes increasingly important the deeper we get into the film.) Although this approach might at first seem confusing it doesnt take long to get used to it and to understand how well it works with this material. By presenting events in Memento backwards Nolan allows us to get into the mindset of the main character. Like Leonard we dont have a clear indication of what happened before the current segment of time. We know some things from the past but not the recent past. Like him we are presented with numerous cryptic clues some of which may mean something other than what they initially appear to represent. And although it might seem that an approach which reveals the storys conclusion in the first five minutes would lack tension thats far from the case. Memento builds to a surprising yet completely logical finale and theres plenty of suspense along the way to keep the viewer riveted. Those who enjoyed the dubious pleasure of piecing together the plot of The Sixth Sense in retrospect will be delighted by Memento which only reveals the entire landscape when the end credits start rolling. Unlike The Sixth Sense however Memento does not rely upon an easily-predicted twist ending to give the storyline meaning. This movie is constructed as a series of clever and logical revelations. It builds to the final scene rather than attempting to ambush us. In addition since many aspects of Memento can be interpreted in more than one way (for example during one critical conversation its up to each audience member to determine whether or not Teddy is telling the truth - Nolan does not offer a ""definitive"" answer) its possible for one movie-goer to have a completely different vision of the films backstory than the person sitting next to him/her. In some ways Memento can almost be described as anti-Groundhog Day. (The presence of Stephen Tobolowsky in supporting roles in both movies strengthens the connection.) Both pictures toy with timelines and memory but while Groundhog Day re-treads one period of time constantly re-shaping recent history Memento represents the past as a vacuum. Bill Murrays character in the 1993 film has multiple memories of a single time period. Here Leonard has none. Another movie that comes to mind when discussing Memento is the Dana Carvey comedy Clean Slate. The two films have pretty much the same premise but while Clean Slate does little with it Memento draws every ounce of potential from this rich well. Lead actor Guy Pearce gives an astounding performance as a man struggling to avoid being manipulated in a world where he can easily become anyones pawn. Its a tight thoroughly convincing performance. Able support is provided by Carrie-Anne Moss who is quickly moving far beyond her label as the ""Matrix Babe"" and character actor Joe Pantoliano (the newest addition to the cast of ""The Sopranos""). But the real star here is Nolan and the way he has edited this masterful thriller into its final format. Every festival has a defining film. Sometimes it wins awards; sometimes it doesnt. For Sundance 2001 Memento was that movie. Despite its diversity of genres the festival couldnt boast anything better; now in the bleak movie-going climate of early spring Memento is poised to breathe life back into art houses and independent theaters that have been as stung as multiplexes by mediocre fare. For those who love films and dont mind endings that dont wrap everything into a tidy package Memento is not to be missed even if you have to make a long trip to reach a theater showing it. When it comes to making a Top 10 list for 2001 one title I wont forget is Memento.

British-born scripter-helmer Christopher Nolan avoids the sophomore slump with flying colors. A bravura tribute to the spirit of ""Point Blank"" and the importance of short-term memory ""Memento"" deconstructs time and space with Einstein-caliber dexterity in the service of a delectably disturbing tale of revenge. British-born scripter-helmer Christopher Nolan avoids the sophomore slump with flying colors while deepening some of the themes so craftily explored in his debut effort ""Following."" Pics aggressively nonlinear structure and subtle accretion of clues suggest a second viewing may yield additional rewards although its all there the first time around for attentive auds. Excellent reviews and encouraging word-of-mouth seem likely for this beautifully structured puzzle which sustains its mystery until the punch-packing resolution of the final frames. Opening credits show a hand holding a Polaroid photo of a bloodied dead man lying face down on concrete. The photo ""un-develops"" -- indicating the scene is being shown in reverse. Its a crucial image as well as an apt intro to a story told via constant episodes of backtracking and partial repetition all meticulously layered to approximate the waking nightmare and endless conundrum of Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce with bleached blond hair and an American accent). If ever there was an unreliable narrator Leonard is it. He can recall everything that happened in his life until the night of the assault that left his wife dead and him with brain damage from being hit over the head. Since then he hasnt been able to make a memory ""stick."" Thanks to his condition Leonard is simultaneously miserable and serene. He has to write himself notes about everything with the most crucial reminders concerning his mission -- such as ""John G. raped and murdered your wife"" -- tattooed on his skin. Unable to remember anyone hes met post-assault no matter how many times theyve interacted Leonard takes Polaroids of everyone he meets and jots captions on them such as ""She will help you out of pity"" (in reference to a barmaid played by Carrie-Anne Moss) or ""Dont believe his lies"" (in reference to an alleged friend played by Joe Pantoliano). Leonards curse is that even if he does get revenge he wont remember it a few minutes later. His condition also puts a fresh frequently comical twist on elements as basic as a chase scene Leonard is running but he cant recall whether hes doing the chasing or is being chased. Terrific idea and ingenious execution may wear thin or grow irritating for viewers unaccustomed to paying close attention. But anybody who dug the trippy triptych structure of ""Pulp Fiction"" should be able to keep up with the temporal shifts as narrative moves back forward and sometimes sideways with the alacrity of a crab scuttling across the widescreen. Dody Dorns editing is top-notch as pic -- scripted acted and lensed with precision -- smoothly toggles back and forth between sequences in Bamp;W and in color. Pearce is superb Moss and Pantoliano are vital sounding boards for Leonards quest and Mark Boone Jr. is a hoot as the motel desk clerk who rents Leonard two rooms on the theory he wont recall having paid for either one. Stephen Tobolowsky is poignant as another victim of short-term memory loss whose sad evolution haunts Leonard. L.A.-set pic has an impressive noir-in-the-sunshine feel built of cars bars motels and isolated hideaways. The ambient rumble of the unsettling ominous score contributes enormously to the discomfiting mood.
