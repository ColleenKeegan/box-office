Unconventional warfare is the mainspring for an utterly conventional military courtroom thriller in ""High Crimes"" marking the less than scintillating reunion of ""Kiss the Girls"" co-stars Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman. Judd now is top-billed but her performance is so resolutely humorless and businesslike that Freemans gruffly affectionate warmth becomes doubly valuable though not nearly enough to lend this generic project any special character. Most disillusioning is how director Carl Franklin once known for tense storytelling and unpredictable characters goes about his task here with a visible lack of inspiration. B.O. verdict should be fairly muted with midrange numbers the most pic can hope for followed by a healthy ancillary session. The screenwriting team of Yuri Zeltser and Cary Bickley has tweaked Joseph Finders novel considerably. Novel itself borrows liberally from other movies particularly ""A Few Good Men"" ""Jagged Edge"" ""No Way Out"" and Oliver Stones general paranoia about well generals and other agents of governmental mendacity. Character alterations refinements re-locations and plot substitutions produce a rabbits warren full of holes in an almost laughably complex plot. By the time the third act exhaustedly appears its hardly a wonder that some major characters have no idea where other major characters are or what theyre doing. This movie-as-plot in extremis starts promisingly with vividly shot (by ace lenser Theo van de Sande) footage of a 1988 massacre in the Salvadoran village of Las Colinas. In a far cozier and upscale present San Francisco defense attorney Claire Kubik (Judd) manages to squeeze in a quickie with nice hubby Tom (Jim Caviezel) before cleverly getting her accused rapist client off on a technicality. The TV coverage of the case makes her a momentary celebrity but the Christmas season glee is ruined first by a break-in at the couples tony Marin home and then by the sudden arrest of Tom by a phalanx of feds. Claires established cockiness is cut down a few notches when she learns Toms secret past life included being a member of an elite Marine special unit and that hes being charged with assault resisting authority and the murder of nine in the Las Colinas incident. Being a movie heroine Claire decides to button up and defend Tom. However Judd already seems buttoned up and her natural emotion in the face of deception plays as forced and mannered. Thesp is further pushed into being the ultra-straight woman for a supporting lineup of mildly comic characters including Adam Scott as the absurdly young naive military defense counsel Embry and Amanda Peet as Claires goofy hippie-ish sister Jackie (whose only purpose here seems to be to fool around with Embry). Judd could have made Claire an interesting control freak particularly when she searches out and meets Grimes (Freeman) a recovering alcoholic who was dismissed from the Marines JAG division for sexual peccadilloes and thus bears a grudge against the Corps. Grimes homespun if cynical wisdom as only Freeman can convey it is summed up when he reminds Claire ""Military justice is to justice what military music is to music."" When Claire gets a look at the ramrod prosecutor (Michael Gaston) and even harder judge (Jude Ciccolella) and realizes she and Grimes have a week to prep for the trial she may be understanding that shes in over her head. Judd alas doesnt let the viewer in on this vulnerability so its up to the all-encompassing plot to pound Claire into a weakened state. The narrative falls fatally in love with its own complications however with one section a false detour and another bit revealing too much too soon. More intriguingly developed and staged is a stratagem devised by Grimes to tape one of the few living witnesses and it works in part because Franklin finally loosens up his shooting style and Freeman momentarily takes over the film. The tape however is disallowed by the judge since the witness suddenly goes missing. The defense team gets desperate and Claire becomes one active defender. Not even Freeman can make Grimes descent into drinking a compelling character flaw since it seems contrived like everything else here to place obstacles in Claires way. A further incident that causes Claire to miscarry a child when she wasnt even aware of her pregnancy is symptomatic of storytelling that cannot say no to a new development or twist. The twists not surprisingly extend all the way to the final minutes with a silly action climax that makes it seem like light years since Franklin made the tingling ""One False Move."" Even though shes playing a woman of means and some legal authority Judd ends up being the woman-in-distress shes made all too familiar from past films and the familiarity loosens pics grip on the viewer. Judd and Freeman work easily together and even though he has far less screen time than in his Alex Cross vehicles Freeman is appealingly freed here of that characters rather prefab Sherlock Holmes-like rigidity. Caviezels naturally vulnerable looks are useful for the filmmakers aims but thesp is lost in the shuffle. Scott is good enough as the green Corps attorney to get beyond the fact that his character is just added comic relief.

"High Crimes A Guilty Pleasure washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids High Crimes A Guilty Pleasure Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday April 4 2002 A solid if conventional thriller of the courtroom variety ""High Crimes"" is movie-going hamburger not steak. Still who can eat filet mignon every day? Sometimes a burger if properly seasoned and neither under- nor over-done is better than a slab of 25 beef. In the hands of chef er director Carl (""Devil in a Blue Dress"") Franklin ""High Crimes"" satisfies a hunger for the basics a decent mystery to chew on a bit of juicy suspense maybe a plot twist as garnish. The fare is all on the standard menu but it goes down well just the same. Chalk that up to a cast the director can trust enough to step out of the way and let do their jobs. At the top of the list are Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman reuniting for the first time since ""Kiss the Girls."" As Claire Kubik Judd is a high-powered lawyer who wakes up to find that her mild-mannered husband Tom (Jim Caviezel) has a secret past. After a minor break-in at their home Toms fingerprints are run through a computer and it comes out that the man she married - some kind of carpenter or furniture craftsman its never clear - is actually Ron Chapman an ex-Marine wanted by the military for a 12-year-old massacre of civilians in El Salvador. Of course he says he didnt do it. Enter Morgan Freeman as Charlie Grimes a two-bit lawyer once drummed out of the JAG corps for having an affair with his commanding officers wife. Hes brought into the case when Claire distrustful of the still-wet-behind-the-ears defense attorney that the military has assigned Tom/Ron (Adam Scott looking all of 16 years old) goes looking for someone with a bit more . . . experience. What a strange dream team. All clipped consonants and press-conference panache Claire is the antithesis of Charlie a leather-and-jeans-wearing ex-souse who motors around town on a chopper and cant be bothered to run a comb through his graying Don King-style fro. A bleary-eyed and world-weary Johnnie Cochran Jr. the self-described ""wild card"" is a talented lawyer but one whos never more than one bump in the road away from falling off the wagon and ruining the case while Claire comes across as a softer more competent Marcia Clark. For the most part ""High Crimes"" unspools by the book. Batting his pretty baby blues for the camera Tom/Ron convincingly and tearily denies his guilt. As evidence comes out that seems to implicate his superior officers in a massive cover-up (notably the scary Juan Carlos Hernandez made up with an ugly eye injury just in case we might mistake him for the good guy) it appears that all Claire and Co. have to do is contradict the sworn testimony of seven eye witnesses. Fortunately beating the military justice system (or any other system for that matter) is only impossible outside Hollywood. What makes ""Crimes"" watchable however are the performances. Judd and Freeman find just enough nuance in their cardboard roles and as actors their enjoyment of the off-balance dynamic they share animates what might otherwise be a rote recitation of a litany of cliches the unearthing of exonerating documents; late-night surreptitiously taped confessions; a last-minute witness; and the constant presence of shadowy intimidating figures going bump in the night. Plus the pair has real chemistry which is something you just cant fake. And yes theres a twist ending but dont kid yourself that you wont see it coming. Surprising? Maybe not. Satisfying? Not half as much as watching Freeman and Judd two compelling performers who seem to enjoy each others company almost as much as we do. HIGH CRIMES (PG-13 115 minutes) - Contains mild obscenity glimpses of strippers brief gunplay fistfights and grainy footage of a massacre. Area theaters.

"High Crimes It Loses on Appeal washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On High Crimes It Loses on Appeal Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 5 2002 ""High Crimes"" is just what Ashley Judd needs right now another undistinguished middle-tier thriller in a career that seems rapidly to be turning so beige you lose sight of it against the wall of the universe. After ""Double Jeopardy"" and ""Kiss the Girls"" youd think the actress would be shy of over-plotted yet thinly dramatized stories that demand little of her except priss and vinegar and a McDonalds arch of an eyebrow. The movie re-teams Judd with Morgan Freeman and as in ""Kiss the Girls"" the two have excellent chemistry. But the movie isnt drawn from one of the Alex Cross novels of James Patterson as was ""Kiss."" Instead it comes from a novel by Joseph Finder who appears to have devoted his life to mastering the oeuvre of Joe Eszterhas the screenwriter whose plot pattern - Eszterhas only had one for crying out loud - in ""Jade"" ""Music Box"" and ""Jagged Edge"" he duplicates here almost stroke by stroke. Other than Judds perkiness and old pro Freemans wary grace and a nice square performance by Adam Scott as a young Marine defense attorney the film has little to recommend it. The only true source of suspense is the race between which alienates you fastest its grating biases or its utter predictability. Its set in the zone where the military and civilian worlds collide both legally and culturally. The gamut runs from civilian lawyers dealing with the rigors of the military justice system - gee do you think the saw ""Military justice is to justice as military music is to music"" will be invoked? - to the strip clubs where the stereotypically decadent lascivious Marines go to ogle hang and snarf brew. Why in these movies are ALL the Marines as bald as cue balls with the brains of spaniels and the aggressive instincts of linebackers? Someone has been watching ""A Few Good Men"" a few times too many for my taste and its a shame that a director like Carl Franklin who has made some really good films like ""One False Move"" and ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" falls for this routine line in a product that is itself completely routine. Attorney Claire Kubik (Judd) has one of those movie-perfect lives Shes a prominent defense attorney very close to making partner at her San Francisco firm; her husband is a lanky dreamy hunk named Tom (Jim Caviezel) who is some kind of custom-furniture artisan with his own studio in back of the couples lavish tastefully decorated arts-and-crafts bungalow in Marin County. It all changes when armed ninjas in black Nomex screaming ""FBI FREEZE"" burst out of a van and take down Tom. It seems hes actually a Marine deserter named Ron Chapman who is accused of massacring peasants while on a covert mission in El Salvador in retaliation for a bombing that killed three American kids. The Corps wants to throw the book at him but he charges that he tried to stop the executions that another Marine (an officer) went berserk and that the frame-up is part of an elaborate cover-up to keep We the People from knowing the true nature of our militarys activities in Central America. Claire of course insists on personally defending her hubby and enlists a tired old ex-Marine ex-alcoholic lawyer named Charlie Grimes (Freeman) as her counselor and adviser. Can you spell r-e-d-e-m-p-t-i-o-n? Of course at every turn shes stymied by bald jarheads who spray mists of saliva when they yell and actually expect her to play by their rules not hers. Theres almost no thriller cliche that goes unissued from the mystery man tracking all this from afar to the preening cackling crew of parasitic reporters to Claires willingness to climb in a car with a strange man and drive to the deserted waterfront. Meanwhile those thugs from the Marine Corps are bugging her phones corrupting her associates and hanging out in strip clubs The final twist besides being utterly predictable is completely arbitrary and it does little to leaven the bile that the movie has already stirred. All in all ""High Crimes"" isnt worth the crayons it took to write the script. HIGH CRIMES (PG-13 114 minutes) - Contains mild violence and a strip-club sequence. At area theaters.

Directed by Carl Franklin from a screenplay by Yuri Zeltser and Cary Bickley based on the novel by Joseph Finder. 115 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence sexual content and language. Several theaters. E-mail this article Print this article The military courtroom drama ""High Crimes"" is crowded with talented people whove lately committed the cinematic crime of being in bad movies. A quick roll call of shame would include Ashley Judd (""Someone Like You"") Morgan Freeman (""Along Came a Spider"") Jim Caviezel (""Angel Eyes"" ""Pay It Forward"") Amanda Peet (""Saving Silverman""). It would be lovely to report that all of them make a shining return to form here -- but like the red herrings throughout ""High Crimes"" it would be a tad misleading. The movies perfectly OK and the cast is fine (with one brilliant exception) but overall this is just another Hollywood potboiler offering little that youll remember past the end credits. It doesnt even have a nice ""You cant handle the truth"" moment like ""A Few Good Men"" the most popular example of this genre -- not much happens in this courtroom and certainly nothing quotable. What it does have though is Freeman being naughty and thats enough to bump it into the worth-seeing category. As Charlie Grimes a maverick lawyer with a drinking problem hes got an uncontrolled shock of bushy hair a goofily lit-up quality and a devastating little wink and hes clearly having so much fun he gives the whole movie a much-needed kick. (He even gets a funny drunk scene.) Elsewhere Judd spouts generic lawyer-talk as attorney Claire Kubik yet another Smart Woman Who Made A Foolish Choice -- namely by not asking a few more questions before marrying her dishy husband Tom (Jim Caviezel channeling his inner gooeyness). Their perfect yuppie life in Marin is dashed when Tom is arrested and accused of murdering civilians during a previous life as a covert military operative. This of course puts one heck of a crimp on their baby-making plans so Claire with the help of Charlie vows to defend Tom in military court. Intrigue cover-ups and lots of skulking around in the darkness follow leading to an ending that can be charitably described as predictable. Director Carl Franklin who made the wonderfully atmospheric ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" a few years back seems to be coasting here; the pace and look of the film are fine but have a certain generic quality. But hes got a knack with actors. Judd tones down her usual perkiness to project strength and resolve and shes got real chemistry with Freeman (theyve teamed before for ""Kiss the Girls""). Peet she of the searchlight-blue eyes and granite jaw line is funny in the throwaway role of Claires younger sister. And Caviezel ... well the screenplay doesnt help him any but he scores a few moments of honesty. ""High Crimes"" is hardly high art but thanks to Freeman itll do until something better comes along.

(BY ) 323-11a Claire (ASHLEY JUDD) and Grimes (MORGAN FREEMAN) react to a surprising development during the trial of her husband. (BY ) High tension / Judd and Freeman play lawyers up against the government in engrossing thriller 1 / 2 Back to Gallery HIGH CRIMES Drama. Starring Ashley Judd Morgan Freeman and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Carl Franklin. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Its a beautiful winter night in San Franciscos Union Square. People are out shopping and the stores are lit up with Christmas decorations. A man and woman walk up Powell Street giddy with the joy that can come only from being in love feeling successful and throwing money around -- when in one second it all changes. Police are everywhere telling them to put up their hands and drop to the sidewalk. Thats the jarring moment from the beginning of ""High Crimes"" director Carl Franklins effective thriller about a wife who finds herself defending her husband on a murder charge. Its a movie that feeds on audience outrage -- at the courts at the military at the federal government in general. It also works on our fear of strange noises in the next room and of shadowy figures in parked cars. ""High Crimes"" has some faults but it manages to keep its audience either angry or jumpy from start to finish. Based on the novel by Joseph Finder the film stars Ashley Judd as Claire a successful attorney with an upscale Marin house and a husband Tom (Jim Caviezel) who has all the manly virtues. Hes handsome hes a woodworker and when the ovulation test reads positive he can be called upon to ""make a baby"" in the five minutes his wife has before leaving for work. So it comes as a shock for Claire to find out that Tom is really named Ron. A former Marine he is arrested and accused of freaking out and killing nine villagers while on assignment in El Salvador in 1988. Framed by higher-ups who are using the case to cover their own crimes Ron wouldnt have a prayer if his wife werent a lawyer played by Ashley Judd. The role of Claire makes intelligent use of Judds sledgehammer relentlessness her fury her focus her loquaciousness. Its a good Judd role but not an ideal one because unlike say ""Double Jeopardy"" ""High Crimes"" doesnt capitalize on her wild-woman delight in herself nor on her danger. Here shes mainly a victim a surrogate for the audiences indignation. The movies spark its flash of the unexpected instead must come from Morgan Freeman as Grimes a crafty old attorney with a falling-down office and a drinking problem. Both genteel and seedy he uses underworld friends such as prostitutes to gather information. Meanwhile the movies wild woman isnt Judd but Amanda Peet in a likable featured role as Claires neer-do-well sister. ""High Crimes"" is the story of a seemingly insurmountable challenge with the defense team -- Judd and Freeman joined by a wet-behind-his-ears military attorney (Adam Scott) -- up against a federal monolith. The other side has guns armies a willingness to do anything and the ability to make any crime look like an accident. If the defense attorneys start winning in court they have to worry about getting killed on the way home. About five years ago we saw a run of paranoid thrillers such as ""Absolute Power"" and ""The Shadow Conspiracy"" in which the government was not to be trusted. ""High Crimes"" with a few twists harks back to those movies. It also touches on areas that are of special interest today such as civilian oversight of covert actions and the makeup and conduct of a military court. The dramatic focus of ""High Crimes"" gets a bit fuzzy in the last half hour - - it starts to feel as if some scenes get replayed. Still the scenes are never dull and the movie recovers for the big finish. Only one thing is lacking throughout not a big thing but big enough to mention. We keep hearing about what great lawyers Claire and Grimes are but theres no great courtroom scene. In that ""High Crimes"" is too much like real life. It gives us court with no courtroom fireworks. . This film contains violence.

All the parts are there but the chintzy result seems like a conglomeration of strategic button-pushing. A military conspiracy yarn its full of open-air behavior by characters who if they had any brains at all would be lurking way back in the shadows. Theres a big twist at the end but youre absolutely certain something like it is on the horizon because of how mundane everything else is. Although the movie ends with a bang the rest of it is an un-melodic commercially polished whimper. Looking for clues Judd plays Claire Kubik a tough Marin County lawyer whos recently made a big media splash by winning a high-profile case. Claires quiet husband Tom (Jim Caviezel) loves his wife to death and vice-versa. Theres even a cutesy scene in the early going in which we see the couple trying to ""make a baby"" rather than simply having sex. Everything is so peachy-keen for the Kubiks you just know something awful will happen to them. And it does.

"USATODAY.com - Disorder in the court Here comes Judd Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/04/2002 - Updated 0357 PM ET Disorder in the court Here comes Judd By Mike Clark USA TODAY High Crimes (out of four) Stars Ashley Judd Morgan Freeman Jim Caviezel Amanda Peet Tom Bower Rating PG-13 for violence sexual content and language Thanks to High Crimes there may be enough titles to launch a cable network devoted to movies in which Ashley Judd is hurting or imperiled because of some man. Talk about a motif. It seems not to matter whether the pictures a romantic comedy like Someone Like You or an over-the-top melodrama like this. Judds characters always seem to get (quoting Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot) ""the fuzzy end of the lollipop."" So too will any sucker who doesnt wait for cable showings to check out this overheated military potboiler. Even TV ads tip off that this is the trashiest movie of its kind since 1999s The Generals Daughter. Employing the broadest strokes from the very first scenes Crimes doesnt just present Judd as an attorney but the kind of hardball super-lawyer who tosses sound-bite bones to the press after shes sprung an accused rapist. This is a woman so focused that we half expect to see her talking on a cell phone while she and her husband (Jim Caviezel) pencil in three or four minutes attempting to conceive. The prospect of this quickie elicits a rare screen grin from an actor already known for playing the walking wounded but soon the characteristic mope is back on Caviezels face. This is because hes arrested for a mass murder committed in El Salvador during his long-ago military operative days -- back when he also had a different name. (Thats something wives always like learning late in the game.) His defense is shaky that a scar-faced colleague was the one responsible for the political executions which in turn were ordered by someone whos now one of Americas highest muck-a-muck generals of course. In take-charge fashion Judd takes a leave of absence from her law firm changes abodes plugs in her fax machine and prepares to bone up on military law. If only there werent seven witnesses fingering her husband as the guy. Though the movie might be better called High Camp its subplots are diverting. And what a litany there are. The lawyer (Morgan Freeman) Judd gets to assist her is a lush naturally. Her live-in sister (Amanda Peet) is a 900-number psychic who parades around in her panties distracting a lieutenant on their staff. Judd and Freeman get beaten up in separate incidents and later get run off the road into a river. We get a public altercation at a fancy dress ball blowzy prostitutes and even a fistfight involving in-custody Caviezel thats a huge breach of security. Carl Franklin (One False Move One True Thing) could have a grand time tackling a movie about the late-60s trial of the Chicago Eight where his circus experience directing this film would come in handy. Its no crime the movie has one or two endings too many given that many thrillers of the past quarter-century have had the same. But Judds latest is too harmless to be anything but a misdemeanor though too many bad pictures (even bad hits) can put a career in jeopardy double and more. Judds characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women Foolish Choices for advice. Judd the actress ought to at least think about its title when picking future projects.
