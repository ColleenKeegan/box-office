Coyote duel in which the cheerful little beeper continually eludes the inept but monomaniacal chasings of the pursuing varmint. Another less often noted but more sober pop-cultural theme is Steven Spielbergs obsession with children (E.T. Empire of the Sun et al.) who as a result of either death or divorce are bereft of conventional parenting and wonder if they can successfully make it to maturity. It is the business of Catch Me If You Can to meld these two subgenres in a single film and see what happens -- which turns out to be very amusing. The movie follows the autobiography of Frank W. Abagnale Jr. a reformed con man. His parents separated when he was 14. Asked to choose one or the other to live with he couldnt make the choice so he skipped town for New York City. Looking older than his years he acquired a pilots uniform and a forged ID. He was soon afforded many boons -- free trips around the country girls (who flocked to this really cute guy in his fly-boy suit) and best of all the ability to cash fraudulent checks largely on the basis of his assured and glamorous presence. Before Abagnales career ended five years later -- the movie compresses the time frame -- he had also passed himself off as a doctor and lawyer and acquired 2.5 million in ill-gotten gains and the avid attention of the FBI which caught and imprisoned him. Here the film written with unforced ease by Jeff Nathanson and directed in the same graceful spirit by Spielberg makes its largest fictional leap; it conflates several FBI pursuers into one. But thats more than all right because Carl Hanratty is wonderfully played by Tom Hanks. He wears half-horn-rims and a dorky little hat speaks in a grating Boston accent and tends to spend his Christmas Eves at the office eating Chinese takeout and obsessing about Abagnale. Its a delicious comic portrayal though not more so than Leonardo DiCaprios charming impersonation of Abagnale which is simultaneously naive and knowing. Abagnales life is shadowed by his failed father (played with melancholic anger by a superb Christopher Walken) who had the spirit of a con artist but none of the breeds subtle skills. There is a happy ending which would be imprudent to reveal. Suffice it to say Abagnale was a smart cookie with the wit to see that his talents might have value in the straight world and the late-blooming moral intelligence not to take too much pride in his boyish exploits. As years passed he married had kids prospered and recognized that what he had done in his youth was not very nice to say the least. Abagnales story combined with Nathansons sensitivity to his family situation and Spielbergs interest in lost boys who manage to find their best selves results in about the nicest movie you could ask for at the holidays a gently funny sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good that is to say entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp overmanipulative Hollywood practices. --By Richard Schickel 25th HOUR STARRING Edward Norton Philip Seymour Hoffman Barry Pepper DIRECTED BY Spike Lee Halfway through his long days journey into night and day again Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) launches into a rant against New York ""F___ you and this city and everyone in it"" He spreads his venom ecumenically -- to the Pakistani cab drivers and the black schoolyard studs and the Soprano wannabes in Bensonhurst and to the Irish-American boyos of whom Monty is one. Its a swell swill of gutter poetry -- written by novelist-screenwriter David Benioff and vigorously illustrated in a tabloid-surrealist style by director Spike Lee -- that touches on everything New Yorkers and Americans love to hate about the big city. Aside from that Grucci Brothers skyrocket of invective 25th Hour is pretty lethargic stuff. Monty a convicted drug dealer on his last day before he is to report to prison does more moping than moving. The virtue of this brutal downer is on the edges in the evocation of New York after 9/11 depressed cratered postapocalyptic. The film suggests that Gothamites have been frozen in their tracks like emotional zombies waiting to see if the next attack can make them feel deader than they already do. --RC Previous Page 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page Home U.S. Politics World Business Tech Health Science Entertainment Newsfeed Living Ideas Parents Sports History The TIME Vault Magazine Subscribe Give a Gift TIME Shop Newsletters Customer Service Site Map Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights Terms of Use Advertising Ad Choices (c) 2016 Time Inc.

"Catch Me If You Can is Spielbergs autobiography. Slate Sign In Sign Up Catch Me If You Can is Spielbergs autobiography. Catch Me If You Can is Spielbergs autobiography. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 23 2002 815 PM Great Catch Catch Me If You Can is Spielbergs swingin autobiography. By David Edelstein In the past two decades Steven Spielberg has become such a pillar of society and a fount of moral rectitude (to the point of expunging threatening moments from reissues of his movies) that its easy to forget how he landed his first professional gigs by sneaking onto the Universal Studios lot setting up shop in an empty office and passing himself off as a director. Spielbergs trajectory suggests a theme thats rarely explored in American success stories How many of the people who seize the day have to in effect fabricate the day. DiCaprio and Hanks as mouse and cat Advertisement That theme isnt exactly explored in Spielbergs buoyant Catch Me If You Can (DreamWorks) either but the movie gets at it obliquely in odd and unsettling ways; and it moves nimbly breathlessly from incident to incident as if the director himself were staying one step ahead of the law. Its the story of a teenage con man named Frank Abagnale Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who in the mid-60s passed himself off as a Pan Am airline pilot a doctor and a lawyer while cashing fake checks worth more than 4 million. As adapted by Jeff Nathanson (from Abagnales memoir written with Stan Redding) the story is neither a comedy nor a tragedy--its arrested halfway between a breezy finger-popping lark and a tale of woe. It has you giggling all the way through--and feeling simultaneous dread at the certainty of its hero going down. Thats not to say that Catch Me If You Can hasnt been shaped along familiar Hollywood (or Spielbergian) lines. Unlike Abagnales more free-form biography the movie is the story of a boy trying to reclaim his relationship with his father--a search-for-daddy saga. Frank Jr. isnt just out to make heaps of money and to sleep with a lot of miniskirted stewardesses in pillbox hats--although both are major assets of this handsome con artists life. Its also to get revenge against the banks and the government that have stripped his father Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) of dignity and caused him to lose the woman of his dreams Frank Jr.s beautiful narcissistic French mother (Nathalie Baye). Walken has been playing bizarre psychopaths for so long now that its astounding to see what he can do with an ordinary weak man As a successful businessman fallen on hard times and trying unsuccessfully to hustle his way out of debt his glassy-eyed etherized delivery makes him seem heartbreakingly vulnerable. (The absence of that ether is what made the lucid Robert Carlyle so wrong as the daddy of all daddy failures in Angelas Ashes [1999].) What gives Catch Me If You Can an extra jolt of pathos is that Frank Jr. is trying to deceive his father too. He doesnt want to impress him as a successful con man but as a popular industrious son who can conquer mainstream America. And the fact that the father senses that his son is a fraud but doesnt have the strength to call him on it--or to set him on a straighter course--makes the movies aura of pathos even more intense. Frank Jr.s nemesis an FBI agent called Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is largely a fictional creation The actual agent was named OReilly and had only one brief encounter with Abagnale prior to the latters imprisonment. Its the films conceit to make them parallel figures Abagnale the irresistible smoothie blithely jumping from place to place and Hanratty the dour plodding fed with the dark suits and skinny ties and flip-up dark glasses. Its fun to see Hanks play a man without a smidgen of charm but the character doesnt have the stature to make him a real co-star. (Its DiCaprios--and Spielbergs--movie.) Im Leo fly me Advertisement But the script is quietly setting Hanks Hanratty up to be something more than a rival for the audiences affection. Hes the nerdy stable father-in-waiting; the father who has to punish you--because kids who get away with too much feel unmoored and maybe even unloved. Early in the film we see Abagnale rotting in a squalid and brutal French prison and Hanratty attempting to extradite him to the United States to a prison where at least hell be purged of lice and properly fed and clothed. (The main part of the narrative is a flashback.) Catch Me If You Can says that America might be square but that its squareness is part of its liberal humanism The system lets people like Abagnale act out and then--like good a daddy--it rehabilitates them and brings them back into the fold. (The French by comparison are either brutally indifferent or whores with an eye on the main chance--thats Existentialism for you.) The best thing about Catch Me If You Can is how easy this capitalist parable goes down. Abagnales book has an element of how-to how to get yourself a pilots uniform and fake ID and pick up pilot lingo and get free flights all over the country; how to create phony bank accounts; how to pass yourself off as a doctor or lawyer. Spielberg makes it hum along faster and more deftly than anyone else could have. Its the tale of a bounder told by someone finding the bounder in himself again--and who cant make up his mind if hes delighted or anxious to get back into that frame of mind. The result has a dramatic complexity that no Spielberg film has had since his first theatrical feature The Sugarland Express (1974). Its also candy for the eye and ear. The production and costume designs (by respectively Jeannine Oppewall and Mary Zophres) feature quintessential mid-60s colors--bold but seductively artificial. This is a universe in which the epicenter of cool is the Eero Saarinen-designed TWA terminal at JFK Airport. When it finally shows up in the film its so perfect that you laugh out loud at seeing that from which all else has radiated. The composer John Williams has concocted his most brilliant pastiche in decades The score manages to combine finger-snapping lounge-lizard jazz motifs (the Frank Sinatra/Henry Mancini ""Come Fly With Me"" fits right in) with suspenseful lines in the Jaws (1975) tradition along with longer more melancholy passages redolent of Leonard Bernstein and Charles Ives. After a series of dud roles DiCaprio is back in star form. He doesnt look like a teenager and his spirit is a little heavy--he looks like he survived the sinking of the Titanic. But that wide face--in the Elvis Presley/Bill Clinton mold--has all kinds of riveting currents and crosscurrents. I dont know if Spielberg Hanks and DiCaprio had our last president on their minds but Catch Me If You Can feels more like The Bill Clinton Story than Primary Colors (1998). Its a paean to naughty boys who dream of potency and become enraptured by their own scams--a great American archetype.

No wait -- hes a surgeon making snap decisions in the emergency room. No wait again -- hes a Louisiana lawyer. Whatever he is -- try con man before anything else -- the hero of Steven Spielbergs Catch Me If You Can is Leonardo DiCaprio. Cast the actor opposite Tom Hanks in a lightweight Spielberg outing with dark undertones and holiday ho-ho-ho looks assured at the box office. Movie review Catch Me If You Can ( out of four) PG-13 sexual content and brief language Opens nationwide Wednesday But didnt Hollywood more or less do this movie without a two-hour 20-minute running time? Try Tony Curtis in The Great Impostor (1961) also based on a true story about a conniver named after his father. Catchs real-life biographical source is Frank Abagnale Jr. who when his parents split up in New Rochelle N.Y. began ringing up about 2.5 million worth of illegal 1960s high jinks at age 16. Amazingly 28-year-old DiCaprio is convincing as someone that age for significant chunks of the movies early going. Catchs opening hour is also its best thanks to Christopher Walkens typically edgy performance as a failed businessman and IRS target seemingly missing just a single gene that might have made him a successful con man himself. DiCaprio keeps trying to help Dad out with money while attempting to establish contact with remarried mom (Nathalie Baye). Its fairly touching -- another of Spielbergs shattered-family sagas -- and a better use of screen time than DiCaprios overly extended pursuit by an FBI agent (Tom Hanks just marginally more than a straight man). Because the real-life Abagnale now leads a productive life its easier to overlook the movies treatment of irresponsibility and -- in one romantic case -- reckless disregard for someones feelings. But its tougher to ignore the movies bloat despite the craft and professionalism Spielberg brings to just about every movie. Catch offers mild fun but never as much as its animated 60s-retro opening credits portend. Theyre the cutest of the year.

Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) passes himself off as a Pan Am co-pilot  one of many personae he assumes  in """"Catch Me If You Can. Holiday Movies / Sit back and enjoy his flight / DiCaprio tries to stay one step ahead of the law in Spielbergs lighthearted Catch Me If You Can 1 / 2 Back to Gallery CATCH ME IF YOU CAN Comedy-drama. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG-13. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Catch Me if You Can"" is 140 minutes of fun. It may have moments of seriousness that are effective and relationships that are presented with depth and sincerity that add to our enjoyment. But what lingers in the memory is the impression of having experienced a frolic a ride through the park on a bright winter day. The fun didnt get there by accident. Someone had to put it there namely Steven Spielberg who is finishing up a very good year indeed. Having cast off portentousness in ""The Minority Report"" he casts off solemnity in ""Catch Me if You Can"" and gives us -- not his best movie -- but one of his smoothest and maybe his friendliest. The colorful cinematography smart performances and brisk tempo suggest a filmmaker subordinating every other impulse to the task of manufacturing pleasure. Spielberg certainly does a job of resuscitation on Leonardo DiCaprio. ""Titanic"" was the boat that sank his talent or so it has seemed given his lumpy performances recently. But ""Catch Me if You Can"" returns him to the crispness and invention that he showed as a kid. Maybe like that other heartthrob Brad Pitt hes just better in comedies. Or maybe playing the role of a kid just freed him up in some way. Related Stories VIDEO OF THE WEEK / Spielberg delights in thrill of the chase / Catch Me a romp full of fun panache He plays Frank Abagnale Jr. a teenager who in the mid-1960s became a master at check fraud. Abagnale upon whose autobiography the film is based used his mastery to steal millions and he also faked diplomas and identities. At different times while still a teenager he impersonated a Pan Am co-pilot and a lawyer and he even got a job heading a hospital emergency room. We find all this out in the movies first moments as Abagnale (DiCaprio) is seen on the 60s game show ""To Tell the Truth."" (Modern footage is intercut with Kitty Carlisle asking questions.) Spielberg has fun re-creating this and other aspects of mid-60s America from the vivid geometric title sequence to John Williams Henry Mancini-like score to scenes of the Abagnale family watching ""Sing Along With Mitch"" -- and actually singing along. Cynicism would arrive later. Americans were more trusting then and thus ripe for the machinations of a young hustler. RESPONSE TO DIVORCE Before he can get to the swindles of course Spielberg the big softie has to show why young Frank chooses crime and make us sympathize. And so in ""Catch Me If You Can"" check forging becomes just a young mans dramatic response to his parents divorce. Spielberg allows us to buy this by lavishing time on young Franks relationship with his father who like his son is theatrical and has a touch of larceny. Christopher Walken plays dad with more than his usual mischief with a warmth and vulnerability. Spielberg floods the frame with light in the moment just before Frank is told that his mother (Nathalie Baye) is divorcing his father. DiCaprio is filmed in full shot under such brightness that his features are indistinct. Its a kind of transfiguration. Within minutes he will leave home and never come back. The specifics of the swindles are amusing but best left for viewers to discover on their own. Suffice it to say that Frank soon becomes an expert -- enough criminal to get an agent on his trail Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks. With his white shirt and thin tie glasses and short-rimmed hat Hanks is made to look like the iconic 60s G-men from the collective American unconscious the spitting image of the Secret Service agents who stood outside Parkland Hospital in 1963. The cat-and-mouse game which takes place over several states and eventually crosses international borders makes up most of the movie. While Frank dresses like that new movie hero James Bond and lives in luxury hotels the long-suffering Carl works late hours and washes his clothes in the Laundromat. POWERS OF PERSUASION In one of the shrewdest scenes the two men meet but Frank is able to convince Carl that hes another agent on the case. The scenes a test not just of Franks persuasive power but of the actors and DiCaprio does splendidly showing a confidence and charm he hasnt demonstrated in years. In its last third the movie loses some of its momentum as Spielberg shifts back and forth from Frank to Carl and explores the nature of their peculiar long-distance relationship. Thats probably inevitable because ""Catch Me if You Can"" is as much about the participants as it is about the chase. Still even when it all gets a bit too languorous and lengthy for what is essentially a romp its impossible to lose interest. Advisory This film contains sexual situations.

Story Tools RELATED  People in the News Tom Hanks  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.com Movie reviews (CNN) -- The long-anticipated ""Catch Me If You Can"" directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks was well worth the wait. DiCaprio plays Frank W. Abagnale Jr. who in the 1960s traveled the world impersonating among others an airline pilot a doctor and an attorney -- all before reaching the age of 21. With the FBI hot on his trail he financed his masquerades by cashing millions of dollars in forged checks. Its the classic example of a story being so far-fetched that it would never have been made into a film if it werent true. After a series of fairly dark films including ""Minority Report"" and ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" Spielberg has returned to lighter subject matter and its a welcome breath of fresh air to have him back making pure entertainment once again. From the crisp chirpy graphics of the opening credits to the films final frames ""Catch Me If You Can"" sparkles as a homage to the early 1960s when a bright-eyed optimism gripped the clean-shaven masses. There was still some innocence in that period between ""I Like Ike"" and the bloody end of Camelot when a mans word was his bond and clothes -- especially a uniform or a pinstriped suit -- made the man. Abagnale took advantage of that innocence over and over again. A man in a uniform The film begins with the 28-year-old DiCaprio playing Abagnale as a teenager. The actor does an extremely believable job. Young Frank is living an idyllic life in mid-America. His mother Paula is a World War II war bride from France (played by French actress Nathalie Baye) and his father Frank Sr. (beautifully played by Christopher Walken) is his sons hero. DiCaprios character Frank Abagnale Jr. disguises himself as a Pan Am airline pilot a doctor and a lawyer. But Frank Sr. is also a man who attempts to find but never catches the American dream. Eventually he grabs for the golden ring one too many times and falls; the family is forced to move from their comfortable suburban home into a tiny apartment. Soon Paula leaves for another man and a better life. This crushes Frank Sr. and drives Frank Jr. to run away from home and into his infamous crime spree -- and a cat-and-mouse game that eventually takes him around the world while cashing millions of dollars in bogus checks. He starts out slowly with phony checks for small amounts but one day he has an epiphany he sees a Pan American Airlines pilot in full uniform breezing down the street admired by all who see him. In the 60s air travel was still new enough that anyone involved in the industry was considered to be glamorous -- and no one was more glamorous than the pilots themselves. In an act that would be impossible in todays world Frank pretends to be a pilot who has lost his uniform -- and hes promptly provided with a replacement. Now hes added years to his age just by wearing a garment of authority and honesty. Hes suddenly able to cash checks for even larger amounts with little or no hassle. He also learns how to ""deadhead"" (fly for free) on airlines around the world posing as a Pan Am pilot. The sheer chutzpah of this action is mind-boggling and even though he is clearly breaking the law you cant help but cheer him on as he gleefully partakes in wine women and song while traveling the friendly skies. Dynamic relationships Hanks FBI agent is tireless in pursuing Abagnale. Now things get really interesting. Abagnales actions have caught the eye of the FBI and as luck would have it the case is assigned to a very persistent agent named Carl Hanratty played by Hanks. The films main dynamic shifts to these two men who form an almost father-and-son relationship -- a relationship which is the heart and soul of the film. Soon Frank Jr. begins posing as other professionals in an attempt to get Hanratty off his trail. He successfully pretends to be an attorney and a doctor (among other things) while barely keeping ahead of Hanrattys determined pursuit. The brilliance of the film lies in the way that Spielberg lets us into the mind of young Abagnale. At first its all a lark but eventually the audience is drawn into Abagnales panic as his options run out. You can feel his desperation in periodic phone calls that he makes to Hanratty. It becomes clear that Abagnales lonely life on the run is taking its toll. DiCaprio is terrific as Abagnale taking his character on a wide-arcing journey of self-discovery. Hanks brings gravity and humanity to his role as Hanratty who truly begins to care for the young man hes grimly chasing across the globe. ""Catch Me If You Can"" is wildly entertaining from start to finish. From its sassy beginning to its dark conclusion this film delivers an enormous bang for your movie-going buck. ""Catch Me If You Can"" opens nationwide on Christmas Day and is rated PG-13 with a running time of 140 minutes.

Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) a wunderkind con artist who cashed 2.5 million in fraudulent checks eluding the clutches of a dweebishly obsessed FBI agent (Tom Hanks) by passing himself off as a pilot a doctor and a lawyer. Set in the 60s Catch Me If You Can catches you up in the blithe spirit of how easy it was in an era when the technology of criminal surveillance was in its infancy for a smart operator to manipulate the power of suggestion. DiCaprio has just the right touch of baby-cheeked deadpan innocence to make you believe in the schemes of this eager boy grifter. For all that the movie starts to grow thin and a little repetitive perhaps because it shows us everything about Frank except who he is.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

A good 40 minutes too long this amiable account of the true story of teenage con man Frank Abagnale Jr. is a case in which the talented players could have won big had they cashed out much earlier; you can literally feel the returns diminishing the longer the game is extended. The larky ""Catch Me if You Can"" is like a trot around the track for the thoroughbreds involved and one of the results is that it takes them far too long to get to the finish line. A good 40 minutes too long this amiable account of the true story of teenage con man Frank Abagnale Jr. is a case in which the talented players could have won big had they cashed out much earlier; you can literally feel the returns diminishing the longer the game is extended. All the same this DreamWorks release remains more likeable than not and prospect of seeing Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks in a breezy entertainment directed by Steven Spielberg will be irresistible to mainstream moviegoers spelling high-flying if not gangbuster B.O. Abagnales autobiographical book recounts a youth so fantastic that its amazing it took Hollywood 20 years to get around to putting it on the screen. Reeling from his beloved parents divorce the 16-year-old left home and discovered talents for survival that he readily turned into a genius for scamming. Playing out a string for an amazing five years Abagnale successfully passed himself off as a Pan Am co-pilot surgeon and lawyer while becoming a true master in one field in particular -- that of writing bad checks. Although the film reps a lightweight breather between the darker and more grandiose projects Spielberg is taking on these days there may also lurk a personal connection for the director with the subject of the film. After all at the very same time Abagnale was pulling his stunts the teenage Spielberg was dressing in coat and tie and trying to palm himself off as an executive on the Universal lot a ploy that paid off when he got a TV directing gig by age 21. Setting a fizzy mood via some very mid-60s animated opening credits and a jazzy John Williams theme that harks back to his ""Johnny"" Williams days as pianist for Henry Mancinis orchestra pic gets off to a jaunty start as DiCaprios Abagnale is introduced as one of three contestants on the venerable gameshow ""To Tell the Truth."" Unfortunately neither is the mood consistently maintained nor is the climax of the TV show ever shown. After beginning with a framing scene of FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks) coming to return Abagnale from his Marseilles prison cell to the U.S. in 1969 action flips back six years to New Rochelle N.Y. Local businessman Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is a romantic better at dreaming and scheming than at supporting his family. His proudest achievement is having brought back a French girl (Nathalie Baye) as his bride after WWII so both he and his son are brought low when her infidelity triggers divorce a matter exacerbated by dads troubles with the IRS. Early scene that foreshadows young Franks abilities as an imposter and clinches the audiences willingness to believe in them has him arriving at a new high school and taking advantage of an instructors absence to pose as the substitute French teacher an act he gets away with for a week. Once he flees home its unclear exactly how he copes but a set of circumstances and a burst of ingenuity lead him to be fitted for a Pan Am pilots uniform and to forge payroll checks that provide him a handsome income and the ability to ride in the cockpits of other airlines jets. His good looks and suave manner make it easy for him to acquire a bevy of stewardesses enabling him to emulate the James Bond lifestyle he explicitly admires. The FBI is on to Abagnale before long but he proves remarkably elusive. Even when Hanratty corners the ""Skyway Man"" gun drawn in a Hollywood hotel room Abagnale is able to turn the tables on his pursuer and slip away to continue his spree this time in Atlanta. Inspired by the trust and help of Brenda (Amy Adams) a naive candy striper Abagnale transforms himself into a doctor and finds himself appointed head of the night staff at a hospital meaning he also gets to select the nurses. Studying his new profession by watching ""Dr. Kildare"" on TV ""Dr. Connors"" no more performs surgery than he ever flew planes but he comes to care for Brenda enough to propose to her and meet her parents in New Orleans where her dad (Martin Sheen) is District Attorney. Ever more audacious Abagnale insists that not only is he a doctor but a lawyer as well. In order to go to work for Brendas father he takes the Louisiana bar exam after two weeks of studying and in the feat that most confounds Hanratty years later passes it. Still the jig is soon up and having run up some 4 million in fraud he admits to his father ""I want this to be over."" Spielberg and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (the ""Rush Hour"" pics) might have taken this as a cue to begin wrapping things up themselves but instead elaborate a great deal of follow-up material to more-is-less effect. Info about how Abagnale under Hanrattys tutelage came to become a check fraud expert for the FBI after serving but part of his prison sentence is interesting and satisfyingly ironic but could have been dispensed in a fraction of the time. Ultimately the film pays for the excess baggage it takes on suggesting this would have been a very good occasion for Spielberg to make his first under-two-hour film since ""E.T."" Lively and appealingly retro as the picture may be it has other problems as well. Attempt to give the story more dimensions than provided by the outlandish narrative result in a wobbly tone. While Abagnales love for his father and evident desire to succeed where the older man has failed provides plausible psychological motivation for the sons exploits the darkening of their relationship as the story progresses adds little and sidelines the narrative at times. Also uncertain is the handling of the young playboys feelings about women; a scene in which he pretends to pay a glamorous hooker (""Alias"" star Jennifer Garner) big bucks for a night of fun has an aspect of deliberately heightened fantasy while his true feelings about Brenda can only be guessed at. More vexing still are the films visuals. Due to the cues received from the opening credits the era involved and the serio-comic approach the viewer could reasonably expect a high-gloss studio look in the manner of a Blake Edwards picture of the period; a bright artificially polished style would have just added to the fun. Instead cinematographer Janusz Kaminski eschews old-school elegance for gobs of blown backlight cascading through windows and other sources even to the point of obscuring faces in the foregrounds. No one in Hollywood shot movies in this fashion until the 70s and the disjuncture here provides a big disappointment given the possibilities for period precision provided by the diverse locations Jeannine Oppewalls resourceful production design and Mary Zophres costumes. DiCaprios winning performance goes a long way toward encouraging the viewer the forgive the film its indulgences and missteps. Still boyish looking enough to more or less pass as a 16-year-old in the early scenes the star uses his confidence as a performer to convince Abagnales dupes and the audience that the character is capable of everything hes doing onscreen. Charming clean-cut and blessing his con man with an optimism that assumes the best possible outcome no matter how dire the dilemma DiCaprio betrays not a speck of the sullenness he exhibited in ""Celebrity"" and ""The Beach"" nor the stoic toughness he used in ""Gangs of New York."" From his black-suit-and-tie uniform to his hat and glasses and constant bedevilment Hanks reminds pleasantly of Jack Lemmon at times in his resourceful and energetic turn as the long arm of the law. In a wonderful performance Walken summons up his characters modest roots romantic spirit caring fatherly instincts and dashed hopes with exceptional economy of means and relative newcomer Adams is a warm presence as the sympathetic fool who falls for the cool young ""doctor.""
