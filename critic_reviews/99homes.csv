Michael Shannon plays the Devil incarnate--Rick Carver a Realtor in Orlando Florida who brings his own team of movers along with the police so that he can evict residents and remove their belongings in one trip in order to resell their houses at a profit. Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) a construction worker who lives with his mother (Laura Dern) and young son (Noah Lomax) gets evicted by Rick but also gets recruited by him to assist him in the foreclosure racket; hoping to earn back his house Dennis accepts the Faustian bargain. Rick is soon revealed to be an actual criminal with elaborate schemes of theft and fraud but his swagger bravado chicanery and varieties of hedonism mark his villainy even more overtly than his actions do. The sympathies of any sane viewer are locked in from the start; most of the movie is sheer emotional overkill. The director Ramin Bahrani admits of no ambiguity but despite his apparent intentions his depiction of real-estate scams is more engaging than the drama. The Devil gets the best lines.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

(Thankless because its Gekkos gleeful inhumanity that makes the character fun to watch and hate.) And just to make things interesting he has to do it in pale pastels and earth tones blanched by the Florida sunshine -- he works in real estate instead of stocks see and a fair chunk of his time is spent conducting evictions on heartbroken homeowners in the wake of that markets crash. The amazing thing is that he mostly manages the job passing his poison philosophy on to a hotel-dwelling construction worker (Andrew Garfield) who wants to buy back the family home. But the protege is the films first weak point his avowed decency -- he loves his simple mom and moppety son -- is a flimsy thing and its quick collapse leaves our hero both pathetic and despicable. Weak point number two is co-writer and director Ramin Bahranis (At Any Price) failure to trim the fat off of several scenes. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

This is the best film Ive seen so far this year Shannon is excellent and and should receive a GG and/or Oscar nom if there is justice in this world. 1 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Matthew Lickona Oct. 29 2015  110 p.m. Well we agree about Shannon being excellent. But that was one of the most sloppily handled weirdly drawn-out climaxes Ive seen this year. And it wasnt alone. Also they lose a lot of their moral authority to condemn the system when they make Shannon such an out-and-out crook. 1 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Sign in to comment Username I have an account.

EntertainmentMovies 99 Homes a gripping drama about saving family house Originally published October 8 2015 at 300 pm Updated October 8 2015 at 147 pm A ruthless real-estate broker (Michael Shannon right) manipulates a construction worker (Andrew Garfield) desperate to keep his house in ""99 Homes."" (Hooman Bahrani) Movie review of ""99 Homes"" Michael Shannon who earned an Oscar nomination for his spooky performance in ""Revolutionary Road"" plays a wicked real-estate broker in this gripping drama. Rating 3.5 stars out of 4. Share story By John HartlSpecial to The Seattle Times Charles Fergusons Oscar-winning 2010 documentary ""Inside Job"" did an excellent job of explaining the economic meltdown of 2008. The human cost of that crisis is even more dramatically portrayed in Ramin Bahranis ""99 Homes"" the fictional story of a wicked Florida real-estate broker (Michael Shannon) who manipulates a desperate construction worker (Andrew Garfield) and his mother (Laura Dern) who are on the verge of losing the family home. Shannon who earned an Oscar nomination for his spooky performance in ""Revolutionary Road"" pulls out all the stops to play this wily predator as the ultimate huckster. Garfield (aka Spider-Man) is just as convincing as the compromised family man who will do almost anything to keep his child and mother clothed and fed. Movie Review 1/2   99 Homes with Andrew Garfield Michael Shannon Laura Dern. Directed by Ramin Bahrani from a screenplay by Bahrani and Amir Nadari. 112 minutes. Rated R for language including some sexual references and a brief violent image. Several theaters. ""Inside Job"" could almost be an alternative title for this gripping and timely drama which makes none of the familys choices look easy. Even the creepy villain has his reasons -- providing you can believe his self-justifying agenda. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT During the housing crisis a newly homeless father reluctantly gets into the eviction business. Rated R (language). BOTTOM LINE A gripping dramatic thriller about the winners and losers in Americas game of mortgage roulette. CAST Andrew Garfield Michael Shannon Laura Dern LENGTH 152 The tragedy happens quickly Dennis Nash a construction worker is evicted from his home along with his mother and young son. After a two-minute grace period to gather a few belongings the Nashes watch as a construction crew dumps their furniture on the lawn. And whos this well-dressed guy holding the deed to their home? Thats Rick Carver a real-estate mogul whos grown rich by flipping foreclosed properties. ""My advice is to get a delivery truck"" Carver tells the family ""because your neighbors are going to have access to everything you own by the end of the day."" advertisement | advertise on newsday Its a shattering scene and not the last of its kind in ""99 Homes"" a story of greed and desperation set in 2010 in Orlando during the housing crisis. Its star is Andrew Garfield (""The Amazing Spider-Man"") as the suddenly homeless Dennis but the movie is ruled by Michael Shannon (""Boardwalk Empire"") as Carver. Shannon an actor whose default expression conveys barely controlled rage plays Carver as the walking incarnation of capitalisms ugliest truth Where theres a loser theres always a winner. ""99 Homes"" begins in earnest when Carver gallingly offers Dennis a low-paying job he clearly cant refuse. Carver sees something else in Dennis though and brings him into his unpleasant but highly profitable eviction business. Old people poor people couples with newborns -- Dennis ejects them all chokes down his conscience and cashes the checks so he can put a roof over the heads of his own family (Laura Dern and Noah Lomax). Carvers methods arent 100 percent legal but whos the real thief -- Carver the banks or all those homeowners who spent beyond their means? ""99 Homes"" is never preachy -- Shannon sees to that -- and always engrossing. Filmed with a documentary-style immediacy and paced as tightly as a thriller by director and co-writer Ramin Bahrani (""Man Push Cart"") its the rare movie that works as sobering commentary and riveting entertainment.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint If your film features a harsh cold SOB call Michael Shannons manager. Hell deliver a top-of-the-line performance hard for anyone else in the cast to match. No matter what happens in the script Shannons screen persona looks ticked off -- as if his shoes were full of gravel. Crime thriller (""The Iceman"") indie tragedy (""Revolutionary Road"") comic book blockbuster (""Man of Steel"") period piece TV (""Boardwalk Empire"") whatever Shannon delivers ominous black clouds of danger as immense as smoke choking a fiery oil field. Of course Shannon will steal your film but hes worth it. In ""99 Homes"" Shannon is Rick Carver a great white shark of the Florida realty world. Ricks specialty is not selling properties but seizing those occupied by foreclosed owners. With court orders and a pair of backup policemen he performs an economic version of aggravated assault dragging away the residents whether they leave with tears legal threats or firearms. Welcome to the Sunshine State. Andrew Garfield plays Dennis Nash whose home shared with his hairdresser mother (Laura Dern) and grade-school son is seized following a payment misunderstanding. Rick sees Dennis a blue-collar builder as a useful flunky. His arrogance pulls back a bit as hardworking Dennis desperate to reclaim his familys home inches up from manual labor apprentice to junior colleague. Soon he is a welcome passenger in Ricks Range Rover copying his wardrobe to impress Ricks well-heeled clients. Dennis who believes there is more to the measure of a man than the size of his bank account feels hes working to help his older and younger generation. That ethical code evaporates as he begins evicting parents of his boys schoolmates. Soon he is deep in the corporate Everglades. 99 Homes 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for language including some sexual references and a brief violent image. Garfield (""The Amazing Spider-Man"" ""The Social Network"") and Shannon make a fine team as men on different steppingstones of moral transformation. Scene by scene they turn a business drama that could have been a lecture into a bloodcurdling morality play. When they end up flat on a lakeside dock after a late boozy party Rick tells Dennis to watch out for the crocodiles. He could be talking about actual reptiles his business partners or himself. In jolts of gallows humor and cutthroat grimaces Shannon creates the kind of performance that makes you want an intravenous drip of blood pressure meds. The film written and directed by Ramin Bahrani (""Man Push Cart"" ""Chop Shop"" ""Goodbye Solo"") is a blistering indictment of avarice. Bahrani has neither an all-out villain nor a hero here. He sees greed as an infectious corruption that can hit the poor victims of eviction and the courts enforcing it as well as the shady operators imposing it. This is a film of palpable anger a finger on the pulse of modern America crafted by a team of rare ability to awaken outrage. Best of all its vintage Shannon. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Immediately after surveying the situation hes back on his phone barking orders to someone with another deal in the works.Well find out why Carver is there later. Meanwhile Bahranis film asks a timely yet timeless question How far would you go to save your home? Would you be wiling to lose yourself in the bargain?""99 Homes"" is all about bargains almost none of them good. Set in 2010 a couple of years after the bottom fell out of the economy and people were struggling to regain a foothold the film finds several decent hardworking folks down on their luck.One of them  Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) a talented fix-it man  is given a second chance of sorts but it comes at a great cost. Nash cant find work and cant find help in court after he falls behind on his mortgage payments. In a monstrously uncomfortable scene sheriffs deputies show up at the door of the home where he grew up and now lives with his mother Lynn (Laura Dern) and son Connor (Noah Lomax).Nash is being evicted a harrowing process orchestrated with cool efficiency by Carver who represents the bank. You no longer own this home he tells Nash. The bank does. You are trespassing. In what is supposed to pass for compassion yet plays like a sick joke they give Nash two minutes to gather whatever belongings he needs; they drag the rest out onto the lawn as neighbors watch.Its hard to sit through this; Bahranis edits make it feel so personal. The humiliation anger and sadness are complete. Soon Nash and his family are living in a cheap motel along with other families in the same leaky boat.But in an odd twist Nash gets a new lease if not on his house (not yet) on life A day after forcing him out of his home Carver offers Nash work. At first its fixing things. Soon its more -- Nash is a quick study. The next thing you know hes evicting people himself in a manner somewhat less heartless than his boss but with the same results.The same results. Theyre always the same right? Call your lawyer pull a gun whatever. The truth still floats over the situation like the darkest of clouds This is no longer your home so get out.Having lived through such a thing gives Nash ... what empathy? Experience? Insider knowledge? Or is it an irony so cruel he cant bring himself to tell his mother and son what he really does for a living or who hes working for?AZCENTRAL99 Homes (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsGarfield is outstanding leaving whatever memories of ""Spider-Man"" you may have far behind. Hes caught in a gruesome position. We see it in his eyes which often are moist. He may hate himself for what hes doing but hes awfully good at it and he needs the money.As good as Garfield is Shannon is better. His Carver is a man who has convinced himself hes on the right side of the ledger. Hes happy to rip off the government homeowners and banks. Hes a monster yet elegant in his way. And he was created by greed by the very entities hes taking advantage of. He may be Satan in an expensive suit but hes a devil of our own making.The housing bust was a nightmare many havent woken from; some never will. Times remain cruel which makes Bahranis film all the more relevant all the more necessary and more than anything else all the more tragic.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield make for an incendiary combo as a predatory realtor and his desperate protege.When down-at-heels handyman Dennis Nash (Garfield) defaults on the home he shares with his mother (Laura Dern) and young son hes just another sucker to foreclosure vulture Mike Carver (Shannon).Article Continued BelowCarver gives Nash a chance to save his home by joining his scavenging crew but its a lifeline attached to an ethical grenade.

(Video Services Corp.)  Peter HowellThis Changes EverythingDirected by Avi Lewis. Opening Friday at TIFF Bell Lightbox. 89 minutes. PGBased on Naomi Kleins bestseller this earnest documentary directed by Avi Lewis doesnt change everything but full marks for trying to by showing how activism can spark environmental change. It distinguishes itself among similar planet-loving docs by showing evidence there is hope in what can often seem an overwhelming bleak task to begin repairs to an industrial-damaged world.Shot in nine countries over four years including stops in Fort McMurrays oilsands and Andhra Pradesh India narrator Klein explains how unified voices in the streets fields and at the ballot box lead to change.

Married-with-children Evan thinks hes getting ""free pizza"" but Genesis and Bel have punishment in mind -- but is it for all men or just the easily tempted Evan? The over-the-top destruction that follows seems all out of proportion to the misdeed but then logic isnt the purpose of a film like this.Peter HowellThe Forbidden RoomStarring Roy Dupuis Clara Furey Louis Negin Karine Vanasse Caroline Dhavernas Mathieu Amalric Udo Kier Charlotte Rampling and Geraldine Chaplin.

Murnau Frank Capra and Monty Python.Lumberjacks submariners skeleton women crazed biker chicks sacrificial maidens confused vampires talking bananas and an erupting volcano all compete for our dazzled senses in a film that also finds time to engage in a ""bladder slapping"" contest and to instruct us how to properly take a bath.Best advice is to disengage your brain and let your eyeballs frolic as one of Canadas most interesting auteurs with co-directing accomplice Evan Johnson riffs on and remakes ""lost"" films often to great comedic effect and an unusual (for Maddin) constellation of colours.Peter HowellLabyrinth of LiesStarring Alexander Fehling Andre Szymanski Friederike Becht and Hansi Jochmann. Directed by Giulio Ricciarelli. 124 minutes. Opening Friday at Canada Square Carlton. STCIf it seems inexcusable that until last month NDP candidate Alex Johnstone didnt know Auschwitz was a Nazi death camp its equally hard to imagine how in 1958 Frankfurt young Germans expressed similar ignorance.They were echoing the sentiment of a war-weary country that chose to put the recent past behind it. Among them in Giulio Ricciarellis riveting Labyrinth of Lies (Germans Foreign Language Oscar entry) is newly minted public prosecutor Johann Radmann (Alexander Fehling very good). His eyes are opened by crusading journalist Thomas Gnielka (Andre Szymanski) who brings him a client (Johannes Krisch heartbreaking as survivor Simon Kirsch) shattered to recognize a one-time camp guard working as a school teacher.

Movie review 99 Homes Article Tweet Broad Green Pictures Andrew Garfield and Michael Shannon in 99 Homes 99 Homes      (out of five) Director Ramin Bahrani Cast Michael Shannon Andrew Garfield Laura Dern Rated R (strong language including sexual references and a brief violent image) Running time 112 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1255pm on Thursday Oct. 08 2015 Thursday Oct. 08 2015 Thursday Oct. 08 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Remember after the recession first hit when layoffs and evictions rained down like a spring thunderstorm?Director Ramin Bahrani ( At Any Price) ventures back under that dark cloud with the preachy but powerful 99 Homes a sketch of lives come undone by a system they thought they could trust. While Bahrani and his co-writers approach the subject matter with all the noisy subtlety of a bar brawl the film rises above mere polemics thanks to charged performances from Andrew Garfield and especially Michael Shannon.Its 2010 and the economy is still in crisis but its all good to predatory Rick Carver (Shannon) an Orlando real estate broker who has grown wealthy being the banks henchman. He zealously evicts homeowners who have fallen behind in their payments seizes the property and puts them and all they own out on the street faster than you can say ""subprime mortgage.""One of the unfortunate ones is Dennis Nash (Garfield) a struggling single dad and construction worker whose employment prospects have collapsed along with the housing industry. With his mom (Laura Dern) and son (Noah Lomax) in tow he ends up in a rundown motel populated by many others just like him shellshocked and lost.He cant find work and moneys running out. Then as luck (or plot contrivance) would have it Dennis ends up working for Rick first as a handyman doing his dirty work (literally cleaning up excrement left behind by an angry tenant in a foreclosed home) and then as a protege slowly being groomed by Rick into the kind of man he once despised.He says hes doing it just to earn his house back from Rick and to restore his familys shattered life. But hes also being seduced by the money. What Rick is throwing at him is much more than he ever could have dreamed of when he was wielding a drill and hammer.Its an age-old story -- a twisted Pygmalion with foreclosure notices -- but well-told all the same. While Bahrani hints that theres enough blame to go around in this mess -- including homeowners getting themselves in over their heads or simply ignoring multiple eviction notices -- theres no doubt who has his sympathies and its neither the banks nor the government.The eviction scenes -- of the laid-off the elderly the mom with a babe in arms the renter with no idea the landlord was in arrears -- are heart-wrenching. They are told they have two minutes to gather their valuables and get out. Their furniture along with all the memories they represent are set on the lawn while the neighbors watch silently knowing that they easily could be next.Shannon plays the rapacious vicious shark with a cruel glee but he lets just enough humanity show through so that Rick isnt totally a caricature. Meanwhile Garfield gives the kind of layered subtle performance thats never called for in his more famous turn as Peter Parker in The Amazing Spider-Man. 99 Homes might have been a better movie with less of a heavy hand especially in its climax. But this economic horror story proves one thing a house being possessed by the supernatural as in Poltergeist is scary; a house being repossessed by the likes of Rick Carver is scarier.

(Broad Green Pictures via AP) HONS In this image released by Broad Green Pictures Michael Shannon portrays Rick Carver in a scene from ""99 Homes."" (Broad Green Pictures via AP) Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) is a working man who has struggled to keep up the payments on his home but has fallen behind. Hes confident that he can set things straight if given a little time but a judge with a backlog of similar cases offers zero sympathy. Still Nash figures he has room to maneuver.He figures wrong. One day he and his mom Lynn (Laura Dern) are surprised when police show up at their door and demand that they leave the premises -- immediately. Theyre further informed that as a courtesy theyll be given two minutes to gather personal belongings. The rest of their stuff will be dumped on the lawn.Before the stunned Nash can gather his wits real estate broker Rick Carver (Michael Shannon) dryly assures him that the eviction is a done deal and that resistance is futile. Nash can only shake his head when his son Connor (Noah Lomax) confronts him about his failure to protect the family. But Nashs shame only begins there. Broke and desperate he accepts a job working for Carver -- helping to do unto others what the system has done unto him.""99 Homes"" is a sobering meditation on economic injustice. Working from a script that he co-wrote with Amir Naderi from a story by Bahareh Azimi director Ramin Bahrani (""At Any Price"") nails the predicament in which so many working-class folks now find themselves. Although they cling to the American dream for many of them it has become a nightmare. Shannon is perfect as the darkly pragmatic Carver who makes no apologies for profiting from the misery of others. Garfield who starred in the most recent ""Spider-Man"" films turns in a nuanced and ultimately heartbreaking performance as the morally compromised Nash. Aside from art-house fare American movies of recent decades have tended to ignore even the most urgent social problems. Despite its lapses into melodrama ""99 Homes"" is a thought-provoking exception.What ""99 Homes""  31/2 stars out of four  Run time 150  Rating R  Content Language including sexual references brief violent image  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags 99 Homes Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-dispatch Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The movie involves the domino effect of people losing their houses their social standing and their self-respect. Its one of the scariest films youll see all year. The plot of 99 Homes is straightforward rich get rich poor get poorer. While that may be one of the oldest stories ever told this drama from filmmaker Ramin Bahrani puts a human face on all those lost houses and eviction statistics. Rick Carver (Michael Shannon) is a real estate agent who has become rich living off the travails -- he evicts people from their houses. Hes working with the bank that has foreclosed for non-payment; by the time hes finished fiddling the bank various government agencies and everyone else who can be scammed hes a very rich guy. 99 Homes opens with a scene of carnage at one domicile that has been repossessed. (Its tough to be detached enough to notice but this bit is shot entirely in one take.) The setting is Florida circa 2010 so the financial crisis is about as bad as it can get. And because its Florida people have guns; they use them too. Rick Carver wears a pistol on his ankle and evicts families with the help of two men from the sheriffs office because people rarely go quietly. Next we meet a working guy named Dennis (Andrew Garfield) whos employed in construction. Theres isnt much work right now and Dennis and his crew have just been informed that their job site is being shut down. They also wont be paid for the last few weeks of work. Dennis lives with his mother (Laura Dern) and his pre-teen son (Noah Lomax) in the house in which he grew up. From his work ethic to his capable single parenthood Dennis is obviously a stand-up guy; when he and his family are the next to be evicted from their house his absolute panic and his anger do not overwhelm his civility. Given two minutes by Rick Carver and his men to grab their most important possessions -- a sequence that packs a monstrous anxiety wallop -- Dennis and his family soon find themselves moving into a motel room. Its a temporary measure he tells his mom and his son but its a slippery slope and they all know it. Dennis and Rick Carver cross paths again and desperate for work Dennis ends up working for him. Dennis needs to get his house back. Carver needs a guy who knows his way around construction work and who is not afraid to tackle dirty jobs. The working arrangement starts off slowly and its all above board. Soon enough however Carver has shown Dennis how much easy money is available in the growth industry of repossessing houses. Dennis turns out to be a steady hand in an eviction too; half the considerable tension in 99 Homes is waiting to find out just how far into Carvers corrupt world Dennis is going to venture. There are tough questions being asked about survival and dignity in 99 Homes a gripping drama distinguished by great performances (and boasting a support cast that seems to include non-professionals to great effect.) The storytelling is masterful but that will come as no surprise to anyone who has seen other of Ramin Bahranis films such as Man Push Cart and Chop Shop. 99 Homes is a movie about how we live now a thriller for grown-ups about everyday life and the social pecking order. Not for the faint of heart mind you. 99 Homes opens in select cities this Friday.

"Intense Michael Shannon puts dramatic human face on foreclosure crisis in 99 Homes - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Intense Michael Shannon puts dramatic human face on foreclosure crisis in 99 Homes Review Intense Michael Shannon puts dramatic human face on foreclosure crisis in 99 Homes Hooman Bahrani / Broad Green Pictures Andrew Garfield stars as Dennis Nash and Michael Shannon as Rick Carver in the film ""99 Homes."" Andrew Garfield stars as Dennis Nash and Michael Shannon as Rick Carver in the film ""99 Homes."" (Hooman Bahrani / Broad Green Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Starting with ""Man Push Cart"" his 2005 debut feature writer-director Ramin Bahrani has made a career out of socially conscious melodramas by putting a dramatic human face on issues more usually found on editorial pages than entertainment sections.Bahranis latest film ""99 Homes"" an examination of the crisis in bank foreclosures and repossessed homes in the guise of a thriller is his best yet largely because of a dynamite performance by co-star Michael Shannon that showcases his formidable gifts in a startling way. An intense actor who specializes in bringing difficult people to life (and Oscar-nominated for ""Revolutionary Road"") Shannon is ideally cast as unswerving Florida real estate operator Rick Carver a man with an eye for the main chance and the foil for the films hero earnest striver Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield.)SIGN UP for the free Essential Arts amp; Culture newsletter gt;gt; While a lesser actor might have turned Carver into no more than the devil in a tropical weight suit the nuanced Shannon is capable of making him unavoidably human. Amoral yes but also a creature of the system who does what he does because those are the avenues that are open to him. See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link ""99 Homes"" starts like a house afire in the residence of a man who has just committed suicide rather than be evicted by Carver. Hes a licensed real estate broker who does the dirty work for banks who foreclose on people whove fallen behind on their payments.Fearless relentless and totally without remorse Carver is so plugged into the system he has the local police on speed dial. Indifferent to the fact that everyone hates him he refuses to get emotional about real estate and sees other peoples misery as nothing but opportunity. ""I cant bring him back to life"" he snaps impatiently when asked about that suicide. ""Stop wasting my time."" 99 Homes trailer Official trailer for 99 Homes. Official trailer for 99 Homes. See more videos Dennis Nash by contrast couldnt be a more different kind of guy. As played by the British Garfield who slips effortlessly into Nashs soft Southern accent hes a decent young man whose work in construction has disappeared because of the bad economy. A native Floridian who still lives in the home he grew up in with his hairdresser mother (Laura Dern) and his young son (Noah Lomax) Nash is adamant that ""aint no one taking the house from us.""Best known to American audiences as Spider Man Garfield is one of the most gifted of young British actors memorable in such diverse films as ""Red Riding Trilogy"" and ""Never Let Me Go."" Hes especially good at sensitive desperation and hes able to project a steeliness behind the despair that catches Carvers eye.The two meet not surprising given the inevitably schematic nature of the script by Bahrani Amir Naderi and Bahareh Azimi when Carver shows up at Nashs door with a clutch of sheriffs deputies announces ""this house is owned by the bank"" and gives Nash and his family two minutes to clear out forever.Forced to live in a cheap motel thats become home to other displaced families Nash is determined to earn enough money to somehow get his home back. Contrivance rears its head and the only job Nash can find is with erstwhile nemesis Carver who hires him with the warning ""you work for me youre mine.""Nash starts with the most menial of tasks but soon enough is taking on more responsibility learning about the scams Carver runs on the government and the bank even getting as comfortable as he can with evicting other people. He doesnt tell his family where he works but he starts to get hooked on the drug that enough money will solve every problem.Because of its strong dialogue and convincing acting ""99 Homes"" stays on point for quite some time artfully disguising the films increasing reliance on plot devices.Finally however those contrivances overwhelm the drama and ""99 Homes"" proves better at illuminating a problem than coming up with a convincing solution for its beleaguered characters. Even Shannon and Garfield can do only so much though it is always involving to watch them try.----------------------99 HomesMPAA rating R for language including some sexual references and a brief violent image.Running time 1 hour 52 minutesPlaying Arclight Hollywood Landmark West Los AngelesMORE REVIEWS  Ridley Scotts geek respect pays off in The Martian  Robert Zemeckis high-wire spectacle The Walk is more adventurous technologically than dramatically He Named Me Malala is a moving portrait of a Nobel-winning woman Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Michael Shannon Andrew Garfield Reviews Laura Dern TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech isnt as large as for Donald Trumps Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Vice President Joe Biden to talk about rape kits on upcoming episode of Law amp; Order SVU Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-99-homes-review-shannon-20151002-column.html,200,99homes10,99homes,latimes

Jones The Bleader Film October 01 2015 Movies | Movie Review Tweet Pin It Reprints Share Ramin Bahrani returns with 99 Homes one of the best films of the year Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield star in this brutal examination of the subprime mortgage meltdown. By J.R. Jones Jr_Jones 99 Homes 99 Homes  Directed by Ramin Bahrani Ramin Bahrani is that rare dramatist who understands street-level economics. Raised in North Carolina and educated at Columbia University the Iranian-American filmmaker made his feature debut with Man Push Cart (2005) the story of a Pakistani immigrant who scrapes through life selling bagels from a cart in midtown Manhattan. Chop Shop (2007) his second feature followed a 12-year-old Puerto Rican orphan and his older sister as they try to pull together a life for themselves amid the auto garages and scrapyards of Queens. Now theres Bahranis extraordinary new drama 99 Homes which takes on the subprime mortgage meltdown of 2008 with its tale of a young man who loses his home in a foreclosure and desperate for work becomes the reluctant protege of the very same real estate shark who turned him out. Few other dramas have dared to address the housing bubble that ruined so many Americans and none with the sense of personal immediacy of real lives affected that Bahrani brings to his story. In some respects 99 Homes reminded me of Wall Street (1987) Oliver Stones much-discussed drama about Reagan-era buccaneers. Both movies focus on a driven young man who falls under the spell of a smooth-talking SOB and slowly but surely surrenders his soul. ""Greed is good"" proclaims Gordon Gekko the high-rolling investment broker of Wall Street; a poster for 99 Homes declares ""Greed is the only game in town."" Theres a big difference though. Wall Street transpires mainly in penthouses and boardrooms its manicured traders barking orders into phones and glaring at computer monitors; the little people being screwed as stocks rise and fall rarely register as more than an abstraction. In 99 Homes those people are seen and heard trembling at their doorsteps and offering their paper-thin defenses as the police prepare to cast them and their belongings to the curb. These encounters are staged with the sort of knowing detail that suggests the writer has seen it all go down himself. Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) a young construction worker in Orlando lives in a modest single-family home with his mother (Laura Dern) and school-age son (Noah Lomax) but the real estate crash has put them in a bad way and Nash has just lost their home in foreclosure court (""I have 40000 cases backed up behind this one"" the judge tells him). Dennis searches in vain for a pro bono lawyer who will handle his appeal and his mother assures him it will all work out. But then one afternoon the police are at their door along with dead-eyed real estate agent Rick Carver (Michael Shannon). ""The time has come you have to leave the property"" Carver explains. Nash and his mother have two minutes to pack up their personal belongings and leave. Workmen sweep in and change the door locks. Before long Carvers crew has dragged all their furniture out onto the front lawn; the agent tells Nash hes got 24 hours to remove the stuff or its gone. ""Good luck"" he adds politely as hes walking toward his car. Carver knows what its like to get screwed by the system while trying to earn an honest living his father a roofer fell off a townhouse and was dropped by his insurance company. Carver started out as a real estate agent putting people into homes before the subprime scandal made it more profitable to flip houses instead. ""America doesnt bail out the losers"" Carver reminds Nash in a soliloquy reminiscent of Gordon Gekkos famous ""greed is good"" lecture. ""America was built by bailing out winners by rigging a nation of the winners for the winners by the winners. . . . Only one in a hundreds gonna get on that ark."" Carver feels for the losers but hes not going to join them. Hes been stalked by people he evicted and one person tried to run him off the road; when Nash asks him if his success has been worth the grief Carver replies ""As opposed to what?"" Thats the question Nash is left to answer as he gets sucked into Carvers business. Desperate to reclaim his family home Nash accepts a few hundred bucks from Carver to clean up a trashed home and before long hes become Carvers right-hand man pocketing bigger and bigger checks to do his dirty work. Bahrani has mastered the nuts and bolts of home foreclosure and the predatory even illegal tactics that can fatten a brokers wallet. One of Nashs primary duties is approaching owners in trouble with an exploitative ""cash-for-keys"" offer of 3500 if they will vacate and clean the premises before their scheduled eviction. Carver sends Nash around to his properties to remove the outdoor AC units and any pool pumps and snap pictures of the disconnected wires on his phone so Carver can claim the owners stole them and bill Fannie Mae. Nash gets a cut of this action and Carver is pleased to learn that hes keeping more money for himself and shorting the guys who help him out. Eventually Nash finds himself on the other side of the fateful door knock evicting a helpless confused old man with nowhere to go but the local Red Cross center. In addition to being one of the years best movies 99 Homes also represents Bahranis first successful attempt to navigate the commercial mainstream--like the films protagonist hes had to weigh the cost of dancing with the devil. Having made three critically acclaimed low-budget features which were compared to Italian neorealism for their vivid images of the poor and their surroundings Bahrani took a stab at working with big-name actors on a more conventional political parable At Any Price (2012) starring Zac Efron and Dennis Quaid as heartland farmers squeezed by big agriculture flopped with critics and moviegoers alike. But this time Bahrani has found a story whose searing emotion cant be shaken off so easily. 99 Homes is both a peerless entertainment and a cri di coeur against a financial system that preyed on the weakest Americans. It never lets you forget that the practice euphemistically referred to as ""flushing out bad loans"" really meant flushing people down the toilet. v Trailer More Movie Review >> Tags Movie Review Ramin Bahrani 99 Homes Michael Shannon Andrew Garfield Laura Dern Noah Lomax subprime mortgage crisis Man Push Cart Chop Shop At Any Price Recommended Video Email Share Digg Newsvine del.icio.us Facebook Reddit Twitter Windy Citizen Add to favorites Saving...

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Michael Shannon is masterfully sleazy as real estate broker Rick Carver who relentlessly evicts the unfortunate in ""99 Homes."" (Hooman Bahrani/AP) By Stephanie Merry October 1 2015 Follow stephmerry Rick Carver is the last person you want showing up at your front door. Its not just that he oozes sleaze but as an opportunistic real estate broker he profits by evicting people which he does with unflinching efficiency. In the drama ""99 Homes"" he is brought to life by todays virtuoso of villainy Michael Shannon who lumbers around tossing off expletives parading his new Range Rover and puffing e-cigarettes. All Ricks money cant hide the fact that he doesnt look well though as if hes rotting from the inside. His foil is single dad Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) a strapping young construction worker who lives in his childhood home in Orlando with his son Connor (Noah Lomax) and mother Lynn (Laura Dern). But not for long. Dennis cant find work and gets behind on his mortgage payments so Rick and his cop cronies inevitably come knocking. Protestations are futile. ""This isnt your home son"" Rick says then gives them two minutes -- as ""a courtesy"" -- to collect some belongings. This is the first of many eviction scenes and they take on a sickening familiarity. First theres the confusion then the pleading; indignation follows before finally resignation. The young couples and the befuddled old man and the parents carrying tiny babies all end up the same way standing on a curb surrounded by as many valuables as they could carry while their neighbors look on. The agonizing desperation of the evicted is almost more than a viewer can stomach as if weve stumbled upon some intimate moment we should never have seen. Director Ramin Bahrani who wrote the script with Amir Naderi and Bahareh Azimi spent significant time researching the housing crisis including witnessing actual evictions and the episodes he has re-created feel powerfully realistic. Dennis ends up moving his family into a motel thats half-filled with other subprime mortgage casualties where someone always seems to be shouting curse words. His need to get out so overwhelms him that he makes a Faustian deal He agrees to work for Rick if it means Dennis can eventually get his familys home back. At first its not so bad -- fixing air conditioners and solving plumbing problems -- and the moneys good. But its not long before Dennis starts helping out with shadier business and is even assigned to evict honest hard-working people just like him. ""99 Homes"" isnt just a straightforward drama. Its a suspense movie that opens with a bloody crime scene has Rick wearing a gun strapped to his leg and features a throbbing score by Antony Partos and Matteo Zingales. The movie also dabbles in advocacy aiming to get people talking about injustices worth discussing. The success of that attempt depends on Dennis remaining likeable despite his increasingly dirty dealings and Garfield does his darndest stroking his sons hair or making his eyes well up with tears when he evicts a family for the first time. He was once Peter Parker after all and he brings with him the same mix of boyishness and responsibility. But even Spider-Man cant compete with Shannon who owns every scene hes in. His character is grotesque sure but hes also funny and quick plus he makes some compelling arguments. ""America doesnt bail out the losers"" he tells Dennis during a tirade that somehow escapes melodrama. ""America was built by bailing out the winners."" Cynical? Sure. But after watching a movie based on many true stories its hard not to agree with that view of our society. R. At area theaters.

"99 Homes review Real estate woes hit hard - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies 99 Homes review Real estate gets devastatingly personal 99 Homes Hooman Bahrani / Broad Green Pictures Andrew Garfield left plays a construction worker and Michael Shannon a real estate operator in ""99 Homes."" Andrew Garfield left plays a construction worker and Michael Shannon a real estate operator in ""99 Homes."" (Hooman Bahrani / Broad Green Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Would you flip a house with this man? Well before 1925 when the Marx Brothers cavorted through a story about the Florida real estate craze in ""The Cocoanuts"" on Broadway the Sunshine State real estate explosion became the boom heard around the world. But explosions go both ways semantically speaking. When a housing market ""blows up"" it can mean success or failure money or disaster. Or money made on the backs of other peoples disaster.The storyline in the tense new drama ""99 Homes"" set in 2010 wasnt and isnt strictly a Florida phenomenon. But the movie wouldnt work as well situated anywhere else. Michael Shannon probably the busiest good actor in movies today plays Rick Carver the master house-flipper and real estate exploiter whose money is made on bank foreclosure properties of which there is a scary supply in the wake of the worst recession since the 30s. When we first see Carver hes in his element inside a foreclosed house. But this homes former owner is a bloody mess dead in the bathroom by a self-inflicted gunshot. Berating the police his own workers and whoevers on the other end of the cellphone Carver barrels through his own life evicting this one flipping that one. Real estate isnt personal he says.One of the unlucky soon-to-be-ex-homeowners is construction worker Dennis Nash played by Andrew Garfield who lives with his son (Noah Lomax) and his mother (Laura Dern) in a home theyre about to lose. ""99 Homes"" establishes its stakes vividly and well in its opening passages. Almost immediately Nash goes to work for the very man Carver responsible for (or at least symbolic of) his no-win circumstance. He needs the money. Nash is a smart man and the Faustian bargain he cuts with Carver lifts Nashs family out of their lousy temporary housing at a motel populated largely by the evicted. For a long time Nash lies to his loved ones about Carver his newfound employer/mentor/corrupter. Its a delayed-secret film in other words in addition to being an angry topical study in what it means to game a cynically unreliable system.The movie comes from co-writer and director Ramin Bahrani and its a change-up in tone and rhythm from his earlier work a lot of which is terrific. In ""Man Push Cart"" ""Chop Shop"" and ""Goodbye Solo"" Bahrani created lovely patient character studies grounded in concrete shrewdly detailed sociological detail. Before ""99 Homes"" Bahrani made a more conventionally plotted family-farm potboiler ""At Any Price"" with Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron. Compared with Bahranis earlier work the narrative felt awkwardly developed. ""99 Homes"" basically works in a way that ""At Any Price"" didnt quite.

Co-writer and director Ramin Bahrani structures his film as... (Michael Phillips) There are some lurches in the final third of the film written by Bahrani and Amir Naderi when Nash bottoms out before his moral reckoning. Its not a subtle film though the reason it succeeds has everything to do with the skill and nuance the actors playing the devil and Faust bring to the project.At this point in his career Shannon could play a wolf such as Carver in his sleep and hed still be effective. He takes pains however not to depict this hollow e-cig-wielding destroyer of peoples souls as a subhuman character. He gets things done; he doesnt kick the nearest dog. Hes too busy kicking the nearest human out onto the curb. Carver needs a foil and even a bit of a conscience and he finds both in Nash played by Garfield as a wily adaptable but increasingly haunted good man. The movie sometimes has the air of a thesis statement about greed and wanton economic destruction. But at its best ""99 Homes"" finds Bahrani tightening the screws on his own style going for speed concision and an agitating rhythm where his previous films took their time. I hope hell go on to make movies combining the vital aspects of all his work. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.

Andrew Garfield (left) and Michael Shannon star in ""99 Homes"" which focuses on the evictions of Florida homeowners as the housing bubble bursts. Photo Broad Green Pictures Thriller 99 Homes gets real about real estate 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""99 Homes"" a gripping intelligent thriller set amid the bursting of the nations housing bubble zeroes in on the ruination of the American dream and the morally bankrupt characters who profited from the carnage. Like ""The Grapes of Wrath"" its a classic example of how to take a social issue and turn it into riveting cinema. The story opens in an Orlando bathroom where a family man has just killed himself to avoid the humiliation of being thrown out of his foreclosed home. Not long after the yellow police tape has been set up real estate broker Rick Carver (the incomparable Michael Shannon) is prowling the premises with an e-cigarette in his mouth a cell phone in his ear and a gun attached to his ankle. Carver needs to make sure that the dead mans grieving wife and kids are shooed off the grounds so he can keep his banker clients happy. Then its off to another residence where Carvers next victims await down-on-his-luck construction worker Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield back in top form after his ""Spider-Man"" foray) his mother (the always reliable Laura Dern) and his son. Its the first of many evictions in this movie and director Ramin Bahraini imbues all of them with a palpable sense of terror anguish and heartbreak. As it turns out Carver sees a lot of leadership potential in handyman Nash who ends up striking a Faustian deal in which he helps the ruthless broker with evictions in exchange for financial assistance. Because of Garfields skill and the strength of the script we sympathize with the desperate Nash and his love for his home even as he forecloses on his moral values. Likewise Shannon provides interesting shadings to Carver. On the surface hes Gordon Gekko with a ""Miami Vice"" outfit but its clear that Carver doesnt enjoy what hes doing or view it simply as a way to get rich. Instead he sees himself as a player trying to survive in a game thats been rigged against 99 percent of the population. Shannon manages to convey an inner loneliness a quiet desperation that hes gone too far but cant turn back. The climactic scene bristles with tension though some may find themselves wanting more of a confrontation between Nash and Carver. Bahraini however more than makes up for this with an indelible final image that is surprising ambiguous and fitting for this film. All in all a highly entertaining and provocative movie. David Lewis is a San Francisco freelance writer. 99 Homes Thriller. Starring Andrew Garfield Michael Shannon and Laura Dern. Directed by Ramin Bahraini. (R. 112 minutes.)

Andrew Garfield flaunts his indie credentials in his first non-Spider-Man role since The Social Network. Its a predictable move but hes picked a winner with this white-hot-angry repossession drama set in 2010s recession-hit Florida. As Spidey Garfields acting superpower was being a normal kid and here hes totally convincing as Dennis Nash a young single dad and out-of-work builder whose home is repossessed after falling three months behind on his mortgage repayments. The film opens with the repo of another house by greedy scumbag property tycoon Rick Carver played by the terrific and frankly terrifying Michael Shannon (Take Shelter). In the game of life Carver is a winner. Hes made a killing buying and flipping homes and can barely keep his lip from curling into a sneer in front these snivelling losers. Over and over director and co-writer Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart) shoots these repossessions as grippingly as a bank heist or a murder. For these people just as much is at stake Theyre losing their lives. After taking Nashs house Carver gives him a job. He likes the kid; hes a good worker. Its also a vanity thing--it inflates Carvers ego to make Nash his protege and impart his wisdom. Nash knows that he shouldnt be working for Carver. Thats why he cant bring himself to tell his mother or son about his new job. Bahrani spins this moral dilemma into a tense riveting thriller. ""If you work for me youre mine"" Carver tells Nash who begins by doing fix-up jobs on vacant properties but is soon promoted to carrying out the dirty work arriving on the doorstep with a court order informing families that the bank now owns their home.  Carver has zero problems justifying how hes made his millions Hes not the government who relaxed lending laws; hes not the banks that lent money to families who could never pay it back; hes not the guy who borrowed too much money for a house he couldnt afford. Why blame him? The system is screwing the little guy--hes just making a buck out if. But for Nash the job is just a means to an end until he gets back on his feet. At least thats what he tells himself at the start of this despairing film about human nature and America. The big question is Why havent we seen more films like this since the financial crash?

Photo Broad Green Pictures 99 Homes is the fifth and most sensational feature by Ramin Bahranis a slam-bang morality play in the Wall Street mode set closer to home. Here the embodiment of rapacious conscienceless deregulated capitalism is now a Florida realtor Rick Carver (Michael Shannon) who evicts people whove been foreclosed on (sometimes under criminally false pretenses) using cops to pull crying pleading raging families out of the houses. Thats what happens to the protagonist Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) a barely employed builder and single dad living with his son and mom (Laura Dern) in the house where he grew up. The scene in which Carver and his men arrive on Nashs doorstep is so agonizingly pitched and gruelingly drawn out that I had to get up and walk in the theater. But Bahrani is pushing it in the name of realism. Owning a home in the United States is hugely freighted with emotion with issues of real worth and imagined self-worth. He wants to invade our space. The film turns on an improbability you just have to go with that Carver takes a shine to Nash who proves himself by literally shoveling shit. Really An evicted homeowner has backed up the septic tank before departing and Nash charges in where Carvers regular lowlife employees wont. This is the Wall Street (also GoodFellas) template in which an honest young man acquires a satanic mentor and cant resist his newfound power. Were complicit. After going through Nashs eviction we root for him to make big money and get his home back even if it means doing unto others ... Well theres the rub. Bahranis last film and first with stars was At Any Price which was better than most people said but made in the drearily realistic style of 80s Midwest farm indies. Bahrani learned from his mistake. He opens 99 Homes with a self-consciously bravura tracking shot that starts on the feet of a man who has just blown his head off in the bathroom while his family stood by and ends with Carver barking into the phone about the next scheduled eviction. In the best devil-mentor tradition Carver delivers punchy driving monologues on the subject of how his business actions make sense in the larger capitalist economy. ""America doesnt bail out losers"" he says. ""America was built on bailing out winners."" Hes proud to steal from the government or its entities like Fannie Mae. He even finds a way of yoking self-interest to Scripture likening himself to an animal refusing to drown when Noahs ark sails. You gotta love Shannon. He has such a twitchy wild-man vibe that most people forget hes a controlled (and marvelous) stage actor. His Carver is a man who -- like Shannon -- has channeled his demons with supernatural discipline. One of my complaints about The Wolf of Wall Street was that Martin Scorsese kept the victims offscreen allowing us to groove on his anti-heros brazenness. 99 Homes is more conscientious -- and more heavy-handed too. When Nash becomes Carvers right hand he evicts weeping screaming families more in sorrow than anger and Garfield signals his misery so madly that the film loses some dramatic tension. But Bahranis casting of Dern is genius. Shes such a profoundly unaffected actress that you instantly buy her aversion to her sons lucre. She has a moral and aesthetic problem with that tacky mansion on the waterway. She wouldnt fit in there. Tidy and moralistic as it is 99 Homes makes you understand why this swampy financial ecosystem thrives. Bahranis first films were lucid studies of people on the outside of society looking in. Now hes able to dramatize the way everyone fancies himself or herself an outsider and -- out of fear a sense of injury or both -- can justify any kind of behavior to get inside. In this time and place even evictors fear the knock on the door. This article appears in the September 21 2015 issue of New York Magazine.

Broad Green Pictures hide caption toggle caption Broad Green Pictures Andrew Garfield portrays Dennis Nash a man charged with carrying out evictions in 99 Homes. Broad Green Pictures The most powerful morality plays work like drama instead of melodrama so youre not just on the side of the victim you also see the world through the eyes of the oppressor. Wall Street did that although Oliver Stone made the devil-mentor of the wide-eyed protagonist Gordon Gekko so charismatic that a generation of moneymen adopted him as a role model. Ramin Bahranis 99 Homes works on the same principle with one key difference. The villain is Rick Carver a predatory Florida real estate agent played by Michael Shannon but the guileless apprentice he corrupts begins as one of his victims. That victim is Dennis Nash played by Andrew Garfield. Nash is a skillful builder but the market has fallen out of the construction business and he barely gets work. He takes out a loan he cant repay on the house in which he lives with his mom played by Laura Dern and his young son. i Michael Shannon (right) is a predatory Florida real estate agent who traffics in evictions in 99 Homes. Hooman Bahrani/Broad Green Pictures hide caption toggle caption Hooman Bahrani/Broad Green Pictures Michael Shannon (right) is a predatory Florida real estate agent who traffics in evictions in 99 Homes. Hooman Bahrani/Broad Green Pictures Early on he fights foreclosure before a brusque judge. Then comes a knock at the door the sheriff and behind him Carver. In the scene that follows a hand-held camera swerves with the characters as the mother cries out in grief and Nash pleads and argues. Bahrani presents this as a primal violation. Owning a home in the U.S. is hugely freighted with issues of self-worth. I found the scene so excruciating I had to get up and walk around the back of the theater. 99 Homes turns on an improbability you just have to go with Carver takes a shine to Nash who proves himself by taking charge of the cleanup of a house where the evicted owners deliberately backed up the septic tank. Soon Carvers giving Nash loads of money to strip foreclosed homes of appliances and later carry out evictions. The carrot is that if Nash makes enough he can buy back his home. The audience is in a tough spot rooting for Nash to succeed and cringing as he does unto others what was done unto him. Carver the films devil-mentor is a man who has channeled his demons with startling efficiency. But 99 Homes is sometimes written with a heavy hand and Garfield -- though hardworking -- overplays Nashs feelings of guilt. He doesnt want the audience to hate him even for a moment so when he evicts people he looks as distraught as they do. Fortunately Dern makes Nashs mother so decent and unaffected that you understand her sons reluctance to tell her the source of his cash. You know youre damned if you cant tell your mom what you do for a living. 99 Homes builds to a predictable but smashingly effective climax. Bahrani makes you understand how this poisonous financial ecosystem thrives. His early films -- among them Man Push Cart and Chop Shop -- were lucid studies of people on the outside of society. Here he shows that in an economic climate this unstable everyone fancies himself or herself an outsider -- liable to be victimized -- and can justify any bad deed. Even the evictors fear theyre one step away from eviction.

(Broad Green Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 24 2015 1245 PM Title 99 Homes Film Info With Michael Shannon Andrew Garfield A guy in a tough spot faces tough choices to help his family. Director Ramin Bahrani. (152). R Language violence. Angelika Lincoln Square. Urgent as a heart attack and as timely as the headlines ""99 Homes"" is one of those films that make other ""topical"" dramas look tinny. This astute intense drama boasts sharp performances and belongs in the same company as films like ""Margin Call"" and ""Michael Clayton"" -- contemporary stories whose of-the-moment nature only makes their great parts better. Michael Shannon gives a tour-de-force turn as Richard ""Rick"" Carver an Orange County Fla. realtor whose work with local banks involves evicting homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments despite their fighting in court for a fair shake. They desperately try to untangle the mess of paperwork and double-talk from their lenders stories Carver has no time for. When they cant extricate themselves in time Carver repossesses their homes and callously says hes not the one to blame when families and their possessions are unceremoniously dumped onto the sidewalk. One of those mortgage defaulters is Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) an out of work construction worker who lives with his young son and his mother (Laura Dern) in the house he grew up in. When Nash happens to be outside Carvers office when an emergency construction job pops up he makes himself indispensible. Carver ever the shark sees a chance to boost business if he hires the hard-working Dennis to help him evict 99 homeowners in a short time in order to get a massive payday. Dennis is initially unsure of the deal but the money hes making with Carver is more than hes ever had and for a while he buries his jobs moral quandaries in order to get his family back on their feet and out of the gross motel theyve been forced to live in. But when Carver insists Dennis do something illegal in order to evict a family hes familiar with Dennis hits a breaking point. Writer-director Ramin Bahrani (""Man Push Cart"") has an ear for how everyday people react when their world is ripped out from under them. Theres the woman who reacts angrily as she has to park her baby and young boy with a broken arm on the sidewalk with all their furniture; the older retiree whos disoriented and confused since his late wife took care of the bank loans; a father ashamed in front of his son. Fear is the first response and violence is on the edges along with tears and desperation. These are the faces of Americans whose trust in the housing market was thrown back at them and who have to suffer indignity and confront danger. This kind of front-line filmmaking was a staple of 1970s cinema and Bahranis film eve with some structural third-act hurdles is in that proud tradition. The movie co-stars Michael Shannon as a shady realtor. (Broad Green Pictures) Garfields performance burrows deep depicting the eagerness and grit of a guy trying to keep his family afloat. (Anyone who caught Garfield in Broadways ""Death of a Salesman"" with Philip Seymour Hoffman knows how good he can be.) We never hear where Dennis sons mother is but we know Dennis own mom (whom Dern as usual imbues with a beautiful defiant streak and feisty strength) had Nash young. When Dennis must do to others what was done to him the kindness and conciliatory tone in Garfield performance is never one-note. Theres a sense of a job that has to be done to survive but a disgust at having to do it. Shannon whos honestly never been bad in anything but hit high points in ""Take Shelter"" ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""The Iceman"" has less notes to hit but man does he hit them out of the park. Shannon comes roaring into the film in the first scene - theres been a suicide in a home hes about to repossess - and hes extraordinary as a bastard and a businessman both a predator and a parasite and the glint in his teeth is only outshone by the knives coming out of his eyes. Yet as Carver teaches Nash how to do what he does theres a flip-side to the American reality weve seen earlier . Carver - the perfect name for this guy as he carves up lives - is seeking his own high ground; it just happens to be on top of the dreams of others. You cant look away from Shannon but thats good because guys like the one hes playing have to be watched every minute. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE TRAILER HERE.

Even as his budgets have expanded and his industry clout has increased the indie director has continued to shine a light on marginalized Americans the people living and working on the fringes of our culture. Whats changed is not the what of his films but the how Where once he operated in a kind of neorealist mode sketching vividly observational portraits of economic struggle like Man Push Cart and Chop Shop Bahrani now folds his social concerns into slicker more star-studded packages. 99 Homes a kind of Wall Street for the Florida real-estate market is easily the loudest plottiest and most conventionally dramatic movie hes made yet. And while its righteous rage is bracing fans of the filmmaker Bahrani used to be will mourn the subtlety and careful character development of his early triumphs. His heart remains in the right place but his head has gone hopelessly Hollywood.Set in 2010 after the bubble burst on Orlandos housing boom 99 Homes casts a suitably frazzled Andrew Garfield as Dennis Nash an unemployed construction worker and down-on-his-luck single father. Three months behind on his mortgage Nash is unceremoniously ejected from his family home and forced to move his son (Noah Lomax) and mother (Laura Dern) into a tiny fleabag motel where other fellow evictees have indefinitely relocated. Bitterly ironic salvation comes in the form of Rick Carver (Michael Shannon) the ruthless realtor who oversaw the seizure of Nashs beloved home and flipped it for a quick profit. Carver whos turned repossession into big business is hiring and Nash is in no position to turn down the work. Before long our hero is the one issuing eviction notices; fully under the wing of his real-estate-mogul boss Nash learns the crooked trade selling out his neighbors for a shot at getting his house back--and maybe also for a taste of the 1 percent luxury Carver lets him sample.Desperation looks good on Garfield who coils with volatility during the big eviction scene--a gut-wrenching spectacle of bureaucratic indecency--and makes his subsequent turn to the cash-for-keys dark side mostly believable. But 99 Homes has little room for emotional nuance. Its a heavy-handed morality play with the thunderous pulse of an action thriller and Bahrani going bigger and broader than usual directs it with maximum sound and fury--all shouting matches urgent montages and scenes of Shannons cartoon fat cat extoling the virtues of greed. As a result the films central mentor-protege relationship never deepens into anything more complicated than a Faustian pact.Part of the problem is the villain who Bahrani and his co-writers Amir Naderi and Bahareh Azimi introduce casually shrugging off the bloody suicide of one of the men hes rendered homeless. No doubt there are plenty of real-life scoundrels just like Carver a callous housing baron whos learned how to prey on the misfortune of the downtrodden and twist a broken system to his advantage. But the film conceives of him as a kind of pragmatic Mephistopheles pure evil in a white collar. And Shannon sucking menacingly on an electronic cigarette when not delivering supervillain monologues plays the character exactly as hes written--which is to say with scarcely a trace of humanity. His General Zod looks like Kal-El by comparison.99 Homes wants to get the blood boiling a task it accomplishes most effectively when simply depicting the hardships of foreclosure Scenes of honest Americans booted off their properties their possessions arranged in stacks on the front lawn are powerfully upsetting as are the glimpses of Florida rocket docket proceedings wherein the suddenly destitute have a mere minute to argue their case in court. Why Bahrani felt the need to Trojan horse this subject matter to audiences in the form of a mainstream melodrama--complete with an armed showdown sad-eyed moppet onlookers and a bad guy thats basically an effigy waiting to be burned--is anyones guess. All the edge-of-your-seat bombast just dilutes the power of the filmmakers well-researched well-meaning lament for struggling homeowners. The smaller his movies get the bigger his compassion looks.

Photo Broad Green Pictures MOVIE REVIEW 99 Homes Running time 112 minutes. Rated R (profanity violence). There might be a great movie to be made out of the financial crisis but ""99 Homes"" which is like being shouted at by a man with bad breath while he grips your collar with both hands isnt it. Michael Shannon an actor who tends to overemphasize one trait in each character plays the Gordon Gekko of foreclosure a realtor gleefully separating people from their homes in 2010 Florida. One victim Dennis (a soulful Andrew Garfield) is himself a construction worker who has lost his job in the crash. Though Dennis wants to kill Rick (Shannon) and Rick barely knows Dennis the realtor hires the construction worker and tells him all about his fraudulent practices. Afflicted with blaring music and grandstanding speeches the movie forgoes any chance at being interesting by making Rick a cartoon villain complete with a cigar. Writer-director Ramin Bahrani forgets that topicality and huffiness dont necessarily add up to a movie.

The bloody scene doesnt faze Rick Carver (Michael Shannon) a skilled amoral repo man designated by the banks to take over forfeited homes. Joking that the man killed himself because he ordered pizza and his wife wanted Chinese Carver brusquely instructs his gang to clean up the place to escort the dead mans survivors outside and dump their possessions onto the front lawn. Trespassers in their own home the family has an hour to clear up and clear out. This three- or four-minute shot opens 99 Homes with cool brutal elegance. Set in 2010 Ramin Bahranis sharp drama which has its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival and will play this weekend at the Telluride festival casts the recent and lingering housing crisis as a tense social parable of the domineering one percent and the imperiled 99. Much more cogent and coherent than Bahranis At Any Price which investigated the ethical dilemma of a farmer driven to corruption the new movie sets up a Faustian bargain with the Mephistopehelia Carver. His Faust is Dennis Nash played by Andrew Garfield. Mothballing his Spider-Man Spandex Garfield slips into the skin of a dispossessed tradesman who can save his family only by learning and perhaps joining the forces of evil. Dennis his mother Lynn (Laura Dern) and his son Connor (Noah Lomax) are among Carvers eviction victims forced to move everything they still own into a small room in a motel packed with the dispossessed. To earn desperately needed money and with the hope of repurchasing his home he goes to work for Carver -- first as a day laborer literally sweeping up the shit from a backed-up toilet then as his bosss mentor and executioner. Think of Its a Wonderful Life and imagine that to get his home back Jimmy Stewarts George Bailey had gone to work for Lionel Barrymores evil Mr. Potter. Then think of 99 Homes as a social parable in Exorcist terms Can Dennis learn the brutal details of repossessing homes without letting the demon Carver possess his tender soul? Somebody had to profit from the Great Recession that forced millions from their homes and Carver is one of them. You could call him a vulture circling the carcass of the American dream of home ownership; hed say hes pursuing a (mostly) legal business to which he applies a coroners dispassion and icy skill. Another unpaid mortgage even if it leads to a mans suicide means another job for him. ""Dont get emotional about real estate"" he says. ""They all got a sob story but the laws the law."" One might agree with Mr. Bumble in Oliver Twist that ""If the law supposes that... the law is a ass -- a idiot."" A spiritual cousin to the sensitive fretful young men Garfield played in The Social Network Never Let Me Go and The Amazing Spider-Man Dennis at first doesnt have the patter down when he knocks on doors to evict homeowners. He apologizes for doesnt command the situation; and unlike Carver he is loath to make eye contact with his marks. But hes smart and knows that making good money often requires a soiled conscience. Hes a bit like Eddie the debt-ridden gambler in the 2008 Vegas Based on a True Story (also shown at Venice and directed by 99 Homes co-scripter Amir Naderi) who is told that robbers may have buried 1 million in his highly mortgaged property. As Eddie went prospecting for gold in his own backyard so Dennis tries to reclaim his own home by throwing people just like him out of theirs. Beginning and ending with a forlorn mans gunplay the movie sometimes uses the blunt tools of melodrama to make its points; and Garfield can get adolescently dewy in skirmishes with his Manichan mentor. But its a great showcase for Shannon who magnetizes all eyes like a cobra in the corner. ""America doesnt bail out losers"" he says. ""America bails out winners."" Shannon as actor and Carver as charismatic scoundrel are winners and neither needs a government bailout to possess every minute of 99 Homes.

Foreclosure Drama 99 Homes Thrills With Its On-Point Fury Tuesday September 22 2015 at 1210 p.m. By Alan Scherstuhl All this and utter emptiness too Hooman Bahrani/Broad Green Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Right up into the 1960s the Hays Code demanded that criminals in American movies face punishment by the final reel a stricture that however well-intentioned served to propagate our national myth that the only route to success is hard work and decency. Crime still doesnt pay exactly onscreen -- the code is dead but onscreen crooks still tend to get busted just before the end credits. Its in the movies middles though that something has changed. The lawbreaking life has come to look impossibly alluring Consider the long vogue of the Scarface T-shirt or the orgies The Wolf of Wall Street blasted into your face like confetti from a cannon.Nobody will mistake Ramin Bahranis superbly acted hard-times morality play 99 Homes for betraying the Hays ideal. Every shot every beat in this tale of an Orlando real estate monster (Michael Shannon) profiting off foreclosures is a nail hammered into the indictment Bahrani is framing. Much of the crime here is straight-up legal but Bahrani denies his villain or his audience any moment to relish the spoils -- as soon as Shannons Rick Carver is alone in his own home a mansion-like suburban monstrosity devoid of distinguishing characteristics his wife complains of vile crank phone calls from the people whose misery funds his lifes chintzy opulence. Hes just annoyed He has to change the number again?Film Details 99 Homes RatingR GenreSuspense/Thriller Running Time112 min. More Info Trailer The film is more closing argument than portrait of life in the downturn but its thrillingly vigorous in its damning. Carver explains to reluctant protege Dennis Nash (played by Andrew Garfield) that houses are nothing to have feelings for -- theyre just boxes and all that matters is how many you own. To that end Bahrani stages the drama in a long series of real houses new and old either emptied out or just about to be emphasizing their drab sameness. As Carver and Nashs crimes accumulate and go from merely immoral to out-and-out illegal Bahrani and director of photography Bobby Bukowskis compositions alienate them from the most familiar of American spaces -- the family home. Theres power in these images even as Bahrani eschews the Scorsese route of examining crimes allurements. 99 Homes denies its bad eggs even the cheap sensual pleasures that wads of cash can afford. Its courageous and honest to give us a crime film scraped of romance even as the film at times feels priggish as if its creators arent quite clear on why people crave money and power.Its courageous to make a crime film without romance.Yet its still a film of stature and power one whose sympathies are with the victims. An early scene a raw long take shows us Shannons hardhearted vulture leading the cops (who call him ""boss"") in the eviction of the family of Garfields nice-guy construction worker. The confrontation is ugly grueling compelling in its detailed nastiness. Its scripted with circling dialogue that sounds as if the screenwriters (Bahrani and Amir Naderi) simply transcribed actual evictions Carver and the cops old pros stick to their brusque eviction script playacting that giving the family two minutes to clear out some valuables is a kindness. In response the family -- including Laura Dern as Nashs mother -- spins out helpless promises and furious insistences Theres been a mistake; come back after we talk to our lawyers; youre trespassing; and -- finally desperately -- but this is our home.Later Nash seeing no other way to raise the money to buy back the house oversees evictions himself as Carvers right-hand man. Bahrani is relentless in pushing us into these situations smartly varying the settings and victims but always revealing the same messy drama the same confounded disbelief crashing against authoritative bluntness. Garfield is excellent in these scenes making clear in each moment Nashs pain kindness and self-loathing. You catch Nash steeling himself swallowing back the heat in his throat reminding himself of the family-first principle that has made him what he hates.The rawness of the scenecraft belies the precise plotting-out of moral dilemmas. Nash proves adept at the hustle brainstorming with Carver how to scam government programs designed to aid homeowners -- and soon graduating from handyman to something of a fixer paying workers cash to steal A/C units from abandoned houses. Garfield proves especially compelling and convincing in the scene of Nashs first compromise a setup so starkly significant and humiliating it brings to mind Stephen Colberts old Daily Show swipe at John Edwards the one about having been raised the son ""of a poor Appalachian turd-miner."" Foreclosed-on residents have abandoned a house but not before smearing feces all over the floors and walls; when Carvers crew balks at the cleanup Nash rolls up his sleeves and gets to it.Its Nashs willfulness -- and command over his gag reflex -- that impresses Carver. Shannon dominates the film but this isnt one of his unknowable inhumans like that self-flagellating federal agent on Boardwalk Empire. As Carver barks orders and chucks families out on the street you can see that this man has had to work to grow so callous -- that hes willed himself mean and that meanness has won him millions but that its still never easy. 99 Homes title could also have been the one Bahrani gave to his last picture At Any Price. Bahrani shows what happens when it becomes more profitable to yoink away the American Dream than it is to encourage people to buy into it. Shannon shows us the toll that that yoinking etches in the face the mind the soul.Inevitably Carver tasks Nash with one crime too many and the wrap-up is as tense and aching as it is too precise in its lit-class symmetries. Whats most potent and memorable here isnt that ending which reminds us that crime only pays for a while nor the overcooked lines where Dern voices the audiences outrage at what Nash has gotten into. Instead its that lack of sensuality that primness that feels a little wrong as the movie unfolds but makes perfect sense afterward Bastards like Carver do it not because theyre seduced but because its the only way they can feel theyre winning.99 Homes Directed and edited by Ramin Bahrani Broad Green Pictures Opens September 25 AMC Loews Lincoln Square and Angelika Film CenterDirected and edited by Ramin Bahrani.

The number of properties referred to in the title of Ramin Bahranis fifth feature may have a literal narrative significance but it must also refer to the population percentage routinely branded as the victims of Occupy-era economic downturn. The perils of illegally gained One Percent privilege make for engrossing high-stakes viewing in ""99 Homes"" which sees Andrew Garfields blue-collared Florida everyman enter a Faustian pact with Michael Shannons white-blazered real-estate shark. Following the lead of 2012s underrated ""At Any Price"" in matching the socially conscious topicality of Bahranis early films to the demands of broader-brush melodrama this dynamically acted unapologetically contrived pic reps the filmmakers best chance to date of connecting with a wider audience -- one likely to share the helmers bristling anger over corruptly maintained class divides in modern-day America. Just as Jason Reitmans ""Up in the Air"" -- a film that took a mildly more sanguine view of the past decades far-reaching financial crisis -- made its viewers endure repeated scenes of humiliating personal disenfranchisement at the hands of corporate America so does ""99 Homes."" Where George Clooneys professional downsizer spent much of Reitmans film coolly relieving people of their jobs here its an unblinking Shannon paying house calls to deliver even worse news to hard-up Orlando residents that their homes have been foreclosed and that they have mere minutes to pack their things and find new lodgings. Its a scenario weve winced through in other cinematic portraits of down-at-heel America though rarely has it been quite so cruelly presented. The very first image in the film is of the blood-sprayed bathroom wall of one evictee who preferred to take his life rather than exit his property. As hardened duplicitous real-estate broker Rick Carver Shannon grants such horrors little more than a disinterested glance before taking a drag on his e-cigarette and moving on to the next victim. The script co-written by Bahrani and veteran Iranian filmmaker Amir Naderi from a story by Bahareh Azimi makes no attempt to present Carver as anything but a pale-suited Satan from the get-go. Still hes rather an admirable villain in one sense A wholly self-made property baron who has clawed his way up from working-class roots by gaming the government at every available opportunity Carver reasons that the American Dream does not come to those who wait. When sent to evict single father Dennis Nash (Garfield) from his lifelong family home Carver recognizes similar class-scaling potential in the young mans enterprising defiance. An unemployed construction worker willing to do anything to get his preteen son Connor (Noah Lomax) and weathered resilient mom Lynn (Laura Dern currently the go-to actress for weathered resilient moms) out of a rough downtown motel heavily populated with other foreclosed families Nash reluctantly accepts Carvers offer of piecemeal employment cleaning and repairing houses recently seized by his unlikely new benefactor. It isnt long before Carver has adopted Nash as a full-time protege training him in eviction protocol and letting him in on the dirty secrets of his success He generates substantial extra income by removing key fittings and appliances from abandoned houses and charging the government for their replacement.  Despite Carvers instincts Nash isnt to the manner born repeatedly balking at the jobs more confrontational duties -- but the lure of his rapidly increasing income and the imminent return of his house ultimately outweigh his moral reservations. Nashs quandary then reflects Bahranis view of Americas social problem. Its not that financial recovery is impossible the film posits but that it must come at the direct inverse cost to another party leading to an economy built entirely around the individual. Its not a subtle argument and its dramatization is often schematic At one point Nash is required to oversee an eviction that mirrors his own familys earlier ordeal almost beat for beat. But Bahranis rhetoric is undeniably rousing and not without compelling supplementary specifics. The legal and administrative loopholes that enable Carvers profitable schemes and the mass displacement of respectable home-owners are articulated here in some detail though the films principal approach is emotional rather than analytical. Carver himself would not approve ""Dont get emotional about real estate"" he advises Nash quite reasonably though his motivations are still entirely material. Where the sentimental would argue that houses are worth only the lives inside them Carver takes a different tack ""Theyre boxes. Big boxes small boxes. What matters is how many youve got."" Like the devil that gets all the best tunes its Shannon -- ideally cast in a role that fully capitalizes on his dauntless stare and imposing almost-handsome physicality -- who gets the choice lines here though his half-snarling half-purring delivery lends a certain snap even to clunkier ones. (Coming from his lips the words ""I see green skies ahead"" seem a genuinely ominous mission statement.) Its a pleasure meanwhile to see Garfield onscreen unencumbered by a lycra Spidey-suit for the first time since his 2010 breakthrough in ""The Social Network."" Always good at deeply internalized anguish and barely masked vulnerability he convincingly navigates his character through some tricky psychological transitions maintaining sympathy and credibility even in the films ramped-up (and somewhat trumped-up) thriller finale. Ensemble work is excellent across the board with those cast as the various evictees contributing a particularly vivid gallery of one-scene performances ranging in tone from white-hot fury to silent desolation. On the technical front the throbbing percussion-and-electronica score by Anthony Partos and Matteo Zingales stands out as Bahranis most substantial miscalculation. Oddly dated and loudly present in nearly every scene the music conveys bleak urgent anxiety from the outset leaving the film little room for tonal maneuvering. The sonic underlining also seems unnecessary with the actors already doing such a dexterous job of delivering Bahranis stinging barely submerged subtext. Serving as his own editor as he did on his first three films Bahrani keeps the narrative at a rolling boil throughout; d.p. Bobby Bukowskis blunt unfussy digital compositions which often allow direct light sources to overwhelm the frame also effectively contribute to the sense of a film with little time for the luxury of beauty. The most invaluable below-the-line contribution meanwhile comes from production designer Alex DiGerlando who furnishes the films broad range of Floridian boxes -- big and small flashy and fetid -- with a wealth of subliminal personal and social history even as they stand empty.

While At Any Price Ramin Bahranis previous dramatic look at how tough things have become for so many working Americans never found its audience this his sixth feature might stand a better shot with the public since its pointedly designed to make your blood boil. In this it succeeds partly legitimately and to some degree via ramped-up melodrama and a notably manipulative musical score. The script by Bahrani and Amir Naderi from Bahareh Azimis story is rooted in an ugly spectacle thats repeated time and again onscreen the forced evictions of families from their homes for not being able to keep up with payments. Served notice without advance warning occupants are forced to vacate within two minutes under threat of arrest for trespassing in houses they may have lived in for years. The merits of each particular predicament aside its not possible to witness this process without being appalled by the severity of the method of carrying it out. It is also a modern film that effectively reframes in secular terms the scriptural query ""For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?"" The first family seen to suffer the indignity of ejection belongs to Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) an industrious construction worker who lives with his mother Lynn (Laura Dern) and son Connor (Noah Lomax) in the suburban Orlando ranch house in which he grew up. In these tough times hes fallen three months behind with his bank to the point that accompanied by cops and the threat of immediate arrest for non-compliance real estate broker Rick Carver (Michael Shannon) instructs them to grab their essentials and hit the road; his crew will move the furniture and other belongings out onto the lawn and if they dont pick it all up soon others surely will. The shell-shocked threesome check into a cheap motel half occupied by other ""evicteds"" people marking time until something turns up if it ever will. Its not a very savory bunch and everyone has a sob story. Ashamed and embarrassed Dennis is most upset about the effect on young Connor who wont be able to continue in his old neighborhood school. Unable to easily secure work he soon finds himself willing for 250 to clean up the literal crap the former occupants of a Carver-seized house have left behind. With no other prospects in sight Dennis surprises no one more than himself by going to work for the very guy who kicked him out of his house. Carver warns him that ""When you work for me youre mine"" which should be a strong clue but Dennis rationalizes bedding down with the devil by concocting a scheme by which hell be able to get his house back this way. Out of embarrassment however he hides the identity of his employer from his mom and his son. Watching decent working people not to mention the elderly who have nowhere to turn getting rudely turned out of their homes with no notice is so appalling that audience empathy with the anonymous victims is automatic. The reptilian Carver has the routine down cold and no one can talk his or her way out of it no matter what. This kind of blunt-force presentation of the ramifications of certain governmental and banking policies over the past three decades -- the action is set in 2010 -- is rare in commercially minded American films so its bracing and sobering to have it laid out so plainly as an everyday reality. However Bahrani undercuts his cause somewhat by sanctioning a cheesy ever-churning electronic musical score that unnecessarily melodramatizes and cheapens the impact of the statement he delivers so passionately; like a roiling sea the soundtrack incessantly insists upon emotional responses of dread and anxiety that would come very naturally anyway. It isnt long before Dennis has his own crew working full-time for Carver not only helping to force evictions but to steal air conditioners and water pumps from vacated houses. Seeing in Dennis strong protege material Carver begins grooming him as such and whenever he sees the younger mans determination falter he offers encouragement along the lines of how in the coming tough times only a few will succeed in boarding the ark while ""all the others are going to drown."" This pertinent theme something willfully ignored by Hollywood other than in dystopian futuristic fantasies drives every scene in 99 Homes. Bahrani and Naderi limit their explanation for how and why things came to such dire state to a too-brief speech by Carver accurately but breezily blaming a series of Wall Street-friendly policy changes by presidents Reagan Clinton and Bush II. Another minute or so of sober explanation might have elaborated on the reasons in a way that would have helped any viewer digest them a move that also would have aimed the film a bit more at the head and not just at the heart and stomach. As it is Bahrani has still created an urgent work the burning anger of which will viscerally connect with many viewers who will recognize themselves or people they know up on the screen. Garfields scruffy Dennis looks bewildered and resentful much of the time but his Everyman working stiff finds the wherewithal to struggle for what he believes is his (even if to the detriment of his family) to be tough in the misguided cause of doing wrong so that he can try to put things right and finally to truly open his eyes. If Dennis is the earnest foot soldier just trying to stay alive day to day Shannons Carver is the jaded top brass whos learned to use a rigged system to his own maximum advantage and has neither pity nor self-regard left. In a role Christopher Walken might have played 20 years ago Shannon impressively portrays the charismatically corrupt master player of a dehumanizing game a man whos learned all the angles and invented a few of his own. While the older suburban neighborhoods throw off a certain nostalgic mid 20th century charm the modern Florida neighborhoods with their soulless mega-mansions and banal luxuries exude a sterile vulgarity that adds a toxicity to the dream of wealth that needs no aesthetic elaboration.

"Review 99 Homes leaves the burner on | The Big Story Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Review 99 Homes leaves the burner on By JAKE COYLE Sep. 22 2015 1039 PM EDT Ramin Bahranis ""99 Homes"" throbs with the public fury and private horror of the real-estate collapse. Set in the Orlando Fla. suburbs Bahrani plunges into the ugly contentious dramas of foreclosure. Its a war movie where thresholds are the battle lines.""This is our home"" cries Andrew Garfields Dennis Nash from his doorway when police and a real-estate broker for the bank Rick Carver (Michael Shannon) collect on his lawn to evict him his young son (Noah Lomax) and his mother (Laura Dern).Its a scene that ""99 Homes"" plays out repeatedly sometimes with tears sometimes with blood and always with a tragic sense of invasion for the turned-out families spilled onto sidewalks.The central twist of the film is that once Nash a jack-of-all-trades carpenter whose work has dried up along with new home construction finds himself out of options hes lured into work by Carver. Hes a Faustian figure a white-suited devil on a cell phone making a fortune profiting on the misfortunes of others.But shacked up in a low-rent motel and with his familys survival very much in question Nash takes the job. He soon finds himself on the other side of foreclosures explaining to others that they are now trespassing on the banks property. Gobs of money some of it underhandedly made help quiet his guilt.Garfield in his first post-""Spiderman"" movie and most adult role to date excels in capturing Nashs desperate transition from the breathless panic of losing his home to his reluctant and dubious rebirth.As he so often is Shannon is a towering force. His Carver is ruthlessly emotionless rationalizing his role as merely a cog in a system controlled by larger entities banks the government.He drives down the block eyeing each house for repossession. His own mansion he says hes had for 18 months but will flip by New Years. Hes a ruthless realist operating in a corrupt system ""Dont get emotional about real estate"" he repeats.The real villain of ""99 Homes"" lies somewhere off-screen. Its the entire rigged apparatus -- predatory lending unfair mortgage rates bailed-out banks -- that has produced both the unfairly evicted and the likes of Carver. ""America doesnt bail out the losers"" Carver says in his big speech. But his hint of relief in the films climactic moment suggests he too feels trapped by the dehumanizing system.Bahrani who wrote the script with Ami Naderi has specialized in socially conscious tales. His first film ""Man Push Cart"" tenderly profiled the life of a Pakistani pushcart vendor in New York. His last ""At Any Price"" with Zac Efron and Dennis Quaid was a melodrama of a Midwestern farming family.His touch isnt always light. Its not every director who will after stretching out every harrowing moment of Nashs eviction then cue the arrival of the sons school bus just when men are emerging with armfuls of their things.But where many well-meaning social dramas inevitably turn soggy with moralizing the visceral ""99 Homes"" keeps its fire.""99 Homes"" a Broad Green Pictures release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""intense peril and disturbing images.""

With ""99 Homes"" Bahrani finds the right mix of the two phases of his career to date mainly on the face of Michael Shannon whos a known Hollywood quantity while also thoroughly believable as a Florida swamp rat who traded in his mullet for a shiny suit. Shannons Rick Carver is a sharp-dressed vulture of an Orlando real estate agent filling his coffers from the general misery of the bursting of the housing bubble. Also read Birdman Venice Review Michael Keaton as an Actor With Caped-Crusader Issues Set in 2010 the film offers Carver as a bad guy (smoking an e-cigarette rather than twirling his mustache) cashing in on bad times and bad policies. In an early scene hes coldly evicting construction worker Dennis Nash (an effective Andrew Garfield) and his family from the home they tried futilely to save via the courts; not long thereafter Nash becomes Carvers employee since theres more work to be found repossessing homes than there is building them. ""99 Homes"" works best when Nash enters into his Faustian bargain and learns the tricks of the trade from his shady new boss. (Carver warns a hedge fund manager that hes weeks away from eviction then buys his fancy kitchen cabinets and appliances off him for 5000 before charging Fannie Mae more than 30000 to install that stuff into the kitchen of another house Carver is selling on the governments behalf.) Nashs eventual crisis of conscience leads the film to more conventional ground but its hard to buy a dramatic moral in a world of too-big-to-fail where bailouts turn into bonuses for bankers who should by rights be behind bars. Bahrani (and co-writer Amir Naderi) want the audience to go to the dark side with them without losing their faith in the system. To anyone who has watched this crisis unfold over the last decade it will feel like a cheat. Reality Life is but a dream in Quentin Dupieuxs ""Reality"" a film that plays around with dream logic without ever falling back on smoke machines or costumed little people. These arent Akira Kurosawas dreams or even David Lynchs but theres a droll absurdity and circular logic that will win over viewers patient enough to ride it all out to the finish. This oddball tale ties together a would-be director (Alain Chabat) a young girl (Kyla Kenedy) a temperamental filmmaker (John Glover) a hypochondriacal TV host (Jon Heder) and a number of other characters in overlapping vignettes that might be dreams might be reality or might be parts of one of several films-within-the-film. Dupieux (the man who made a tire the protagonist of the cult horror fave ""Rubber"") keeps dangling clues to the audience but nothing in ""Reality"" is supposed to make any more sense than dreams do even though the film does follow rigorous sleepytime logic. Still with dry humor coming from a cast that includes dramatic actors (including Elodie Bouchez) and stiff-upper-lipped comics (Patrick Bristow Eric Wareheim) ""Reality"" remains engaging all the way until the lights come up. Also read Sin City A Dame to Kill For Review Eva Green Steals This Juvenile Film Noir The Look of Silence Director Joshua Oppenheimer brought his eagerly-anticipated follow-up to ""The Act of Killing"" to Venice but ""The Look of Silence"" feels more like an extended DVD extra to his genre-defying previous film than a stand-alone documentary. Once again exploring the perpetrators of the mass killings in 1960s Indonesia -- in which millions of farmers union members and intellectuals were all branded ""communists"" and thus subject to execution -- Oppenheimer mostly retells the same story through a much more conventional focus. This time around his protagonist is an optometrist born in 1968 whose life has nonetheless been haunted by the murders since his mother still feels grief over his older brothers death. We see the man confront various politicians and members of the death squads -- at the risk of his own life and that of his wife and children -- as well as some widows and children of the chief perpetrators. ""The Act of Killing"" took a new angle at historical tragedy giving the executioners enough rope to hang themselves as it were by encouraging them to boast of their accomplishments. ""Silence"" comes off as a less effective approach covering the same ground with few new personal revelations. There are some powerful moments -- a killers sons balk at watching footage of their father bragging about slaughter a 1960s NBC News report in which reporter Ted Yates credulously listens to a government official describing communists who have asked to be executed -- but overall ""The Look of Silence"" wont generate the excitement of its predecessor.
