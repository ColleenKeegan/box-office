Landscape gardener Rob Schneider was once a shy kid who didnt get the chance to show his prowess on the baseball diamond so he takes his chance now by joining social inadequate David Spade and mummys boy Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite himself) to confront the slick Little Leaguers whove bullied the areas junior nerds off the park. Their pro-geek stand captures the attention of eccentric billionaire Jon Lovitz and soon theres a tournament arranged with a brand-new stadium the glittering prize. Its quite literally men against boys but bizarrely were meant to be rooting for the grown-ups giving the sporty kids an ass-kicking - at least when the movies not wallowing in fart jokes or product placement which is much of the time. And just when the baseball slapstick starts wearing thin a final-reel gush of truly cynical sentiment on behalf of the physically challenged sends the ordeal-factor off the scale.

Scarier still is that this morphing of The Bad News Bears and a Three Stooges episode parades its dumbness with such zip that it almost passes for clever. David Spade in a hideous moptop is a wimpy video-store clerk and Jon Heder in a role that makes Napoleon Dynamite look like Brad Pitt is a booger-eating paperboy. The three losers play a series of Little League teams snatching victory from the jaws of slapstick humiliation. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Young male auds may be drawn by promise of a guilty pleasure laff riot. Gags about boogers flatulence projectile vomiting and ""titty twisting"" are batted about like so many foul balls in ""The Benchwarmers"" a minor-league comedy about three adult dweebs who seek redemption of some sort by playing and defeating Little League teams in tournament play. Pic wasnt prescreened for critics perhaps because Sony figured this blooper was aimed at people who dont read reviews (or much of anything else). But the film opened to 20.5 million suggesting that this guilty pleasure laff riot for young male auds may have broader appeal. Pic traffics heavily in wish-fulfillment for nerds geeks and other socially maladroit types. Gus (Rob Schneider) has a lovely wife (Molly Sims) and a successful landscaping business but he has never fully recovered from a childhood marred by bullying experiences.Still hes far from being a total spaz. The same cant be said of his two best friends -- vidstore clerk Richie (David Spade) and overage paperboy Clark (Jon Heder) -- who spent their grade-school years as easy targets for cruel classmates. After Gus rescues an easily intimidated youngster from the torments of bullying Little Leaguers on a neighborhood sandlot he earns the gratitude of the boys father Mel (Jon Lovitz) an extravagant billionaire with his own unhappy memories of being a picked-upon kid. For Mel living well is the best revenge but its just not sweet enough. So he provides the financial backing for Gus (whos actually a pretty good baseball player) to form a three-man team -- called the Benchwarmers of course -- with the chronically klutzy Richie and Clark. Then the billionaire lays down a challenge to all young players in the area offering a multimillion-dollar sports stadium to the winner of ""Mels Tournament of Little Baseballers and Three Older Guys."" ""The Benchwarmers"" is a fantasy impure and simple so its probably unfair to judge the behavior of its characters by real-world standards. Still pic never completely dispels the discomforting impression that theres something rather creepy about adults trying to increase their self-esteem by defeating humiliating and occasionally physically manhandling children. True enough scripters Allen Covert and Nick Swardson take pains to depict many of the younger opponents as nasty bullies and emphasize that at least one of the blowhard coaches (Craig Kilborn) used to be an even nastier bully himself. But thats not nearly enough to keep the protagonists from seeming borderline pathetic. Under Dennis Dugans rote direction Schneider winds up playing straight man to Spade who once again relies on his snarky coward shtick and Heder who comes across like someone doing a bad imitation of ... well Heder himself in ""Napoleon Dynamite."" Lovitz also goes through familiar motions but hes clearly enjoying himself and his joy is sporadically contagious. It helps that he gets some genuinely funny stuff to say and do as the proudly nerdy Mel flaunts prized purchases. He owns an original Batmobile and the K.I.T.T. car from ""Knight Rider"" as well as ""Star Wars"" memorabilia. But wait theres more -- Mel also manages to hire no less a coach than Reggie Jackson (a good sport when it comes to self-parody) for his Benchwarmers. Like many comedies of its kind ""The Benchwarmers"" builds to a climax that combines gross-out humor and schmaltzy sentiment. The sappy stuff reeks of fraudulence but give the filmmakers some credit The outcome of the final game is satisfyingly upbeat without being entirely incredible. Tech values are much better than necessary. The BenchwarmersProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures and Revolution Studios presentation of a Happy Madison production.

Starring David Spade Rob Schneider and Jon Heder. Directed by Dennis Dugan. (PG-13. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Benchwarmers"" operates in an alternative reality where dorky guys marry hot blondes every kid is either a mean jock or misunderstood nerd and Jon Lovitz is still an employable Hollywood actor. Its a movie where grown men play baseball against prepubescent children and youre supposed to root for the adults. Its a movie packed with so many idiot characters that Rob Schneider is cast as the cool guy -- and sort of pulls it off. The latest film from Adam Sandlers production company wasnt screened for critics so this warning comes a little bit late. But it shouldnt have been too hard to figure out that ""The Benchwarmers"" wasnt going to be art house fare -- Sandler himself stayed away from the picture failing to register even the 30-second uncredited cameo that he bestowed upon ""Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo."" Thats an inconsistency because while this new movie isnt especially funny it isnt Bigalow bad either. The comic trio of Schneider David Spade and Jon ""Napoleon Dynamite"" Heder are certainly an improvement over Schneider and Eddie Griffin -- in the same way that a pair of fours in poker beats a king a jack and three junk cards. ""The Benchwarmers"" could just as easily been called ""Revenge of the Nerds V Breaking Training."" Schneider Spade and Heder are Gus Richie and Clark three friends of varying levels of dorkiness. When they see some kids getting victimized by jocks on a baseball field they challenge the young athletes and beat them -- catching the attention of a billionaire played by Lovitz. A series of events that is too stupid to repeat has the trio of misfits playing in a baseball tournament against preteen little leaguers and the moral of the story is a confusing lesson in nerd empowerment. The comedy in ""The Benchwarmers"" is powered by the scant natural ability of its stars who seem to be ad-libbing a lot and arent afraid to humiliate themselves. Spade in particular has a few decent scenes which all become slightly funnier because he wears Adam Richs haircut in ""Eight Is Enough"" throughout the film. Nick Swardson who plays Richies agoraphobic brother Howie also comes through in a role limited by the fact that hes huddled in a closet for most of the movie. Schneider is likable although his character never really makes sense. Why does a short guy who mows lawns for a living and ignores his responsibilities have a wife so smoking hot that most major-league ballplayers would have a hard time getting her attention? And since Gus seems pretty normal why is he best friends with an imbecile (Heder) who wont stop picking his nose and eating it? Its best not to ask these questions when watching movies such as ""The Benchwarmers."" Just enjoy the endless flatulence jokes and try to ignore the fact that youre the only one laughing. -- Advisory This film contains profanity comic violence and some extremely misguided product placement unless movies about guys who eat their own boogers really make you feel like dining at Pizza Hut.

"Jocks nerds collide and -- surprise -- its funny - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Jocks nerds collide and -- surprise -- its funny By James Parker Globe Correspondent  |  April 8 2006 As part of the ongoing culture war between aesthetes and vulgarians the mind and the body the snooty arbiters of taste and the roaring belching marketplace critics were not granted a preview screening of The Benchwarmers."" This total bypass of the organs of discrimination is a growing phenomenon; the studios (Sony in this case) apparently think it worthwhile to sacrifice the publicity of a few reviews for the chance to make some money before audiences discover how terrible a given movie is.And so it gives me a perverse pleasure to announce that The Benchwarmers"" is not terrible not terrible at all. Yes the plot is terrible some of the jokes are terrible and Rob Schneiders bizarre from-the-neck-up oxblood tan is terrible but the movie as a whole is a more-than-acceptable addition to the genre of shameless and hastily made American comedy. I laughed eight times and a gentleman behind me was wheezing in delight. Interestingly The Benchwarmers"" contains its own culture war -- in this case between the nerds"" those crash-helmeted human blossoms and the grimacing jocks"" who hound them bent on twisting their nipples.Schneider plays Gus a landscaper who gathers his nerd friends (played by David Spade Jon Heder and the excellent Nick Swardson) into a baseball team with which -- through his own skill and the magic of nerd luck -- he can wreak revenge upon the bullies and blowhards. Jon Lovitz plays Mel the teams billionaire sponsor. As always Lovitz seems to be inhabiting an entirely different filmic dimension with a strange Brechtian distance between himself and the lines he silkily utters. He is the Jeff Goldblum of vulgarity. This is music to my ear hair"" he announces with lascivious relish.There are the usual fart gags and excrement fixations but there are also moments of beauty. One character describes a cathartic encounter with a longtime tormentor As I cowered in my peanut butter fort he apologized to me. . . ."" And the spectacle of defeated jocks groaning beneath self-administered nipple-twists will not soon be forgotten. Craig Kilborn slides across the screen enjoying himself as usual and shouts Lets strap it on and beat these geeks"" Reggie Jackson appears as himself. Pizza Hut and PlayStation are plugged with great assiduousness. Whats not to like? (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.
