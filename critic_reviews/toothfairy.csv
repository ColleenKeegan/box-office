It involves lots of lying to your family a bit of self-discovery and a lot of pratfalling and wailing like a loon. Dwayne The Rock Johnson treads water as Derek an ageing hockey star slumming in the lower leagues after an injury whose trick is to come on at the end of the game and smash his opponents teeth in hence the nickname Tooth Fairy. Living as a bachelor but making solid ground with a divorcee played by Ashley Judd Derek is charged with two weeks actual tooth-fairy duty after he selfishly reveals to his girlfriends daughter how the money really ends up under the pillow. Apart from being poorly constructed and only mildly amusing the film suggests that a child would rather believe that the whole tooth-fairy operation is run from a ruthless mercantile trading floor in the sky than merely be consoled by the possibility that it all just happens. Everything about the film feels like the product of a calculating mind right down to the bit where Judds teenage son makes the bizarre proclamation that its his dream to scale the epic rock-star heights of Eric Clapton or failing that Stevie Ray Vaughan. The one element that lifts this above utter tedium is the presence of Stephen Merchant as tooth-fairy administrator Tracy. That he manages to come away with his dignity intact is testament to his skill as a comedian.

The marvelously handsome wrestler- turned-actor -- proving once again better than the material he takes -- dons tights and a baby-blue satin tunic in the slight family comedy ""Tooth Fairy."" Former NHL player Derek Thompson (Johnson) is an enforcer for a minor league team. His nickname on the ice is ""the tooth fairy"" and the opener reinforces Rodney Dangerfields quip about going to a fight and a hockey game breaks out. When not defanging opponents of an incisor here a molar there Derek has no problem divesting kids of their dreams. When he does this to the wee daughter of his girlfriend Carly (Ashley Judd) hes in for a humbling. Swept up into the tooth fairy world hes pressed into a version of community service by head administrator Lily (Julie Andrews). Even as Derek learns the ropes of tooth fairydom he still has human hurdles to clear. He must bond with Carlys kids toothless sweetie Tess (Destiny Grace Whitlock) and Randy (Chase Ellison) a sulky teen. He must also deal with his hockey teams new wunderkind Mick (skateboarder Ryan Sheckler) a guy even cockier than he is. Johnsons got appealing comedic timing a dazzling smile and he looks unbelievably good in tights. Still his gifts have been better used in other outings such as ""The Rundown"" ""Be Cool"" even Richard Kellys weirdfest ""Southland Tales."" This vehicles treads are worn. Johnson isnt the only sport lending right effort to this flawed fairy tale. Andrews has stern charm as Lily. And Stephen Merchant brings swift-talking loopiness to Tracy a wingless fairy and Dereks caseworker. Five writers with impressive credits (""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and ""City Slickers"" among them) worked -- and reworked no doubt -- this formula of redemption. Still no magic. Typically we dont agree with the saying that puns are ""the lowest form of humor."" We like them; they make fine headlines. But while there are a couple of surprises the puns are overly relied upon for chuckles. Billy Crystal adds vintage vaudeville yuks in a cameo. Hes James Bonds Q of the tooth fairies introducing Derek to the tools of the trade. How bizarre it is that two very different flicks of winged characters open today. ""Legion"" about warrior angels bent on our destruction flaps into multiplexes too. They didnt screen that apocalyptic tale in time for a homegrown review so who knows? But ""Tooth Fairy"" suggests just how hard it can be to honor the imaginations of children with good material Even for a movie about protecting their ""what ifs"" and make beliefs. ""TOOTH FAIRY."" PG for mild language some rude humor and sports action. 1 hour 48 minutes. Directed by Michael Lembeck; written by Lowell Ganz Babaloo Mandel Joshua Sternin Jeffrey Ventimilia and Randy Mayem Singer; from story by Jim Piddock; photography by David Tattersall; starring Dwayne Johnson Ashley Judd Stephen Merchant Ryan Sheckler Seth MacFarlane and Julie Andrews.

(Diyah Pera) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 22 2010 ""Tooth Fairy"" is cute. Which is to say that Dwayne Johnson is cute. How could anybody with the body of Arnold Schwarzenegger (circa 1984) and the smile of Cameron Diaz not be especially when dressed -- albeit briefly -- in a pink tutu? This StoryTooth Fairy The only gaps are in the smiles of the childrenWatch Tooth Fairy trailerFind showtimes The Artist Formerly Known as The Rock shines as Derek Thompson a once-promising pro hockey player now relegated to the minors who is sentenced to perform a bizarre kind of community service after almost destroying a little girls (Destiny Whitlock) belief in the Tooth Fairy. The muscle-bound yet genial wrestler-turned-actor -- who has recently become the go-to guy for kids comedies with such fare as ""Planet 51"" ""Race to Witch Mountain"" and ""Get Smart"" -- almost single-handedly carries this movie on his broad beefy back. Its not heavy lifting; the movie is as light as cotton candy minus the cavities. When bitterness over his own career setback prompts Derek to blurt out to his girlfriends (Ashley Judd) daughter that theres no such thing as you-know-who he finds himself with a summons from the Department of the Dissemination of Disbelief where a sort of executive fairy godmother (Julie Andrews) orders him to time as one of her army of tooth fairies. The irony is that Dereks hockey nickname -- earned from his propensity to knock out opponents teeth -- is itself the Tooth Fairy. Wait a minute youre saying theres more than one Tooth Fairy? In this movie there is. In fact one of the films charms is the way it carries childhood mythology to its logical if absurd extreme. Surely one person even a magical one couldnt collect all the teeth lost in any given day all over the world leaving money in their place. Santa Claus remember has a staff of elfin helpers. The movie envisions this tooth business not as the work of a single individual but as the job of a well-oiled bureaucracy. Something like the Postal Service only more efficient. Supplementing the work of career fairies are occasional draftees like Derek. The films funniest scenes feature Derek on the job assisted by a wingless fairy caseworker named Tracy (Stephen Merchant). Other treats include an uncredited appearance by Billy Crystal. He plays the fairy equivalent of James Bonds gadget man Q parceling out such company-approved aids as shrinking paste invisibility powder and amnesia dust. All of which come in handy when Derek is confronted by locked doors parents who are still awake and the occasional little boy who opens his eyes to discover a two-inch-tall man with wings crawling out from under his pillow. ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane also makes a nice cameo as Ziggy a pusher of inferior-grade street versions of the aforementioned controlled substances. Of course theres a sticky-sweet message too. Something about the importance of following your dreams even against all odds. For those who care theres even a come-from-behind sports story line thats so prominent its almost more of a film-within-a-film than a subplot. But ""Tooth Fairys"" best moments have less to do with faith than with cold hard analysis. Its at its best not when it gets all touchy-feely but when its showing us just how the business model of nocturnal tooth collection and cash disbursement might actually work. Not just in some fantasy world but in this one. Turns out ""Tooth Fairy"" is less about the power of imagination than logistics. .  1/2 PG. At area theaters.

Dwayne Johnson the for mer wrestler sometimes known as The Rock deploys his usually reliable gift for self-mockery for naught in the bland and unfunny family comedy ""Tooth Fairy."" He plays Derek Thompson a minor-league hockey player nicknamed ""The Tooth Fairy"" because his opponents often require dental work. One day he tries to tell his girlfriends young daughter that theres no such thing as -- you guessed it -- the tooth fairy. In this charmless and underdeveloped knockoff of ""The Santa Clause"" this lack of belief lands Thompson in Fairy Central -- in a pink tutu tights and wings. Basically if youve seen the ads youve seen the only joke in this one-joke movie although there are also endless groan-worthy gags about wings and teeth. Even Billy Crystal who has a single scene as a Q-type supplier of fairy equipment such as invisibility spray is shooting with blanks here. Michael Lembeck who directed the less-than-classic second and third ""Santa Clause"" features stretches the 20 or so minutes of plot provided by six credited screenwriters (bet there were at least six more) over 102 excruciating minutes. Most of the humor revolves around Thompson hiding his new duties as the tooth fairy (and his flamboyant ensemble) from his girlfriend (Ashley Judd who deserves better) her children (including a son who aspires to be a musician) and his hockey teammates. There is also laborious humor involving Thompsons fussbudget angel caseworker played by ""The Office"" co-creator Stephen Merchant in his first -- and hopefully last if you ask me -- major big-screen role. As if the movie didnt need another spoonful of sugar the chief Fairy Godmother is played by Julie Andrews in her first movie for Fox since the legendary flop ""Star"" (1968) almost put the studio out of business. ""The Tooth Fairy"" is enough to make your teeth ache. Sorry.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Jan. 22 2010 Starring Dwayne Johnson Ashley Judd Stephen Merchant and Julie Andrews. Directed by Michael Lembeck. 101 minutes. At major theatres. G Dont judge a tooth fairy by his tutu.Heres the first movie surprise of 2010. The Tooth Fairy starring Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson as a hockey enforcer who has to do time in a pair of baby blue wings for being a non-believer in the magic of cash for bicuspids isnt bad. In fact theres a few laugh-out-loud lines sprinkled like pixie dust in this predictable story.Article Continued BelowThe biggest drawback is Johnson (The Game Plan Race to Witch Mountain) who is as wooden as the mahogany he appears to be carved from. Although pro skateboarder Ryan Sheckler (Life of Ryan) who plays an arrogant young hotshot out to bench the ancient Derek is a close second. Written by committee with six names down for the job the flick moves along at a decent clip thanks to veteran director Michael Lembeck (The Santa Clause sequels which handily provide the plot device for The Tooth Fairy).The satire and quips are fun but the treacly sappy stuff is a bit much. Guys playing poker over a round of juice boxes? A ridiculous side plot about a school talent show which seems to be the fallback line for any movie aimed at kids doesnt help.Johnson plays Derek a minor-league hockey player dubbed The Tooth Fairy for his molar-rattling hits on opposing players. Hes got a sweet girlfriend Carly (Ashley Judd) and a monster-sized ego and figures its time her cutie-pie daughter Tess (Destiny Whitlock) knows the truth about which tooth fairy is real and which one isnt.For his dream-killing crime Derek is sentenced to a week doing the tutu-wearing side of the tooth fairy business his punishment enforced by the head fairy Lily. As the elf in charge Julie Andrews is just the right mix of Mary Poppins and vengeful overseer. Were not sure what she does with all those teeth but it seems like a good idea to keep those molars coming.Aside from the flying fairyland is no different from any other workplace. There are economic realities in this fantasy world. They had to downsize the dragon division. Non-believers damage their cred and stock tumbles. So get out there and swap those kiddie teeth for dollars. Comic bits come from earnest and gangly Tracy the wanna-be tooth fairy assigned to mind Derek played by Stephen Merchant (Extras). Billy Crystal - strangely uncredited - is a basement-dwelling motor mouth who outfits the new tooth fairy recruit with everything from shrinking paste to cat-away spray. His patter is pure borscht belt - a revisiting of his Miracle Max role in The Princess Bride.Kids wont mind any of The Tooth Fairys flaws and will find the sight of burly Johnson in a pink tutu hilarious. Parents get a couple of clever gags that will make them forgive the filmmakers. And if we all remember to floss everybody wins.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Tooth Fairy review Like having a tooth pulled but less fun |       NJ.com comments Tooth Fairy review Like having a tooth pulled but less fun Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 21 2010 at 606 PM updated January 21 2010 at 639 PM View/Post Comments FOXDwayne Johnson left plays a minor-league hockey player turned provisional tooth fairy; Stephen Merchant center and Julie Andrews right are his colleagues.The Tooth Fairy (PG) Fox (102 min.) Directed by Michael Lembeck. With Dwayne Johnson Ashley Judd Julie Andrews. Now playing in New Jersey. ONE STAR Dwayne Johnson is a big tough hockey player who doesnt believe in dreams. So one night a magical Julie Andrews waves her wand and takes him to a place far far away where she gives him wings and turns him into a tutu-wearing tooth fairy. Are you laughing yet? No? Thats too bad because thats pretty much all ""Tooth Fairy"" has in the way of jokes with only a few slight variations. Dwayne Johnson in shiny tights. Dwayne Johnson throwing around magic pixie dust. Dwayne Johnson flying around like a clumsy Tinkerbell. Wait. Youre still not laughing? Neither was I Im afraid as I sat through more than an hour and a half of that one-note joke stretched out by an awful lot of bad puns (""You cant handle the tooth"") surprising guest stars and simply sad why-has-it-come-to-this? casting choices. And thats the awful ""Tooth."" Johnson is a big game open-faced fellow whos clearly up for anything but theres not much he can do with a movie so flat and confused and just plain unwatchable it starts to make you miss his ""Race to Witch Mountain"" or ""The Game Plan"" or ""Southland Tales."" OK maybe not ""Southland Tales."" Theres not much to this picture once you get past the ridiculous set-up though there are a few nagging questions. Such as what is Billy Crystal doing here? (Besides not being funny that is.) And why is Seth MacFarlane Fox TVs lowbrow animator of choice playing a fairy gangster? At least Andrews adds a few grace notes as Johnsons new standoffish boss; besides shes reached a point where shes allowed to coast. But Ashley Judd? Didnt she once have a sort of interesting career and make movies like ""Ruby in Paradise"" and ""Heat""? Looks like she could use a bit of magical fairy dust herself. As it is shes reduced to playing the part of Johnsons girlfriend and spends most of the movie standing around looking slightly jaundiced and very perplexed. The oddly golden glow I blame on her makeup artist; the confused expression I blame on the script. Eventually (although not soon enough) things wind down to a foregone conclusion. Johnson finishes his tooth-fairy assignment his hockey team wins a few games and -- always crucial in movies like this -- Everyone Learns Something. Except of course those few hardy souls who seeing this go up on the local multiplex marquee are still thinking ""Oh good A new Dwayne Johnson movie"" Or indulgent parents who accompany their kids to this without a good shot of novocaine. Or something. Ratings note The film contains some supposedly comic violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Dwayne Johnson plays a massive muscled hockey player who suddenly sprouts wings and takes a shift as the eponymous dental pixie. His biceps are large his attitude baaaad. His feathery white membranes peak like a doves. All thats missing is an image of The Rock in his official fairy regalia which consists of a shiny satin pajama top over baby-blue tights. Its not a good look for him but its better than the alarming pink tutu he first wears when hes recruited and zapped to Fairyland. All in all youd be hard pressed to find a sillier milder or more predictable movie. And youd be correct in pegging it as The Santa Clause in nylons (director Michael Lembeck helmed Clause 2 and Clause 3.) Yet Tooth Fairy isnt half bad outfitted with gently funny high jinks that place its brawny lead in progressively ridiculous circumstances. The nontoxic silliness of the thing seems altogether fitting given the subject matter; no doubt Lars von Trier could make a film about the tooth fairy but it probably wouldnt be marketed to children. When we first meet Derek ""Tooth Fairy"" Thompson hes smashing an opposing player through the Plexiglas at a minor-league hockey game. After the poor fellas tooth flies toward the ceiling to the joy of announcers (""Its an incisor"") Derek retires to the penalty box with a feculent grin on his handsome mug. His teeth are intact. Later he tells his girlfriends (Ashley Judd) daughter (Destiny Grace Whitlock) that the other sort of tooth fairy doesnt exist. Then he steals the cash under her pillow. The guys got it coming to him thats clear. ""It"" arrives in the form of a summons from the Department of Dissemination of Disbelief where Derek suddenly finds himself in the aforementioned tutu. There he meets Julie Andrews (as the stern fairy boss-lady) Stephen Merchant (as a wingless fairy caseworker who has in Dereks words ""the eyes of a big tuna"") and Billy Crystal (as an outfitter of such useful fairy gear as shrinking paste invisibility spray and short-term amnesia dust). The Crystal scenes are amusing. So are a few of the broader battier comic escapades as Derek begins his stint as a fairy. Reducing him to a helium-voiced mini-Rock and flushing him down the toilet (off-screen) are obvious-enough gags but I wont deny laughing at them. And my fourth-grader spent much of the time in stitches. A half-dozen writers contributed to the screenplay and which ones came up with which jokes is anyones guess. I liked the crack about Johnsons Easter Island head -- I never noticed the resemblance before but wow -- and didnt much mind the usual dose of sentimental moralizing a compulsory part of every family comedy. So Derek does penance gathers teeth and learns important lessons. Lembeck deserves some credit for the movies low-level elfin campiness but Tooth Fairy would be substantially less likable without Johnsons native-born flair for self-abasement.

Hoping for a good movie in January can be as pointless as expecting to catch a glimpse of the tooth fairy. So when a truly entertaining midwinter comedy finally appears its the moviegoing equivalent of finding say a C-note stashed under your pillow. A serendipitous combination of star (Dwayne Johnson) material and director (Michael Lembeck) this tale of an arrogant hockey player forced to serve time in wings and a pastel-colored tutu scores a goal for kids and adults alike. With Johnsons fan base steadily mounting ""Tooth Fairy"" might well become one of his most successful outings yet. Following on comedies like ""Get Smart"" and ""The Game Plan"" Johnson has emerged as a surefooted movie star with a ready willingness to mock himself to embrace his tough-guy bravado even as he undermines it. At a time when physically imposing stars with nimble comic timing are in short supply Johnson fits the bill to a T. A former big-time hockey player whose career was sidelined by injury Derek Thompson (Johnson) is known for his aggressive on-ice antics; he earned the moniker Tooth Fairy for habitually knocking out opponents teeth. Having borne witness to his own crushed dreams Derek callously advises a young fan and aspiring hockey player to lower his expectations. After he steals tooth-fairy money from his girlfriends daughter Tess (Destiny Grace Whitlock) for a poker game hes due for a lesson in humility. That comeuppance arrives early one morning in the form of an involuntary trip to Fairyland and an audience with the Tooth Fairy Matriarch (Julie Andrews practically perfect in every way) who promptly informs Derek of his violation killing childrens dreams. For that Derek must serve two weeks moonlighting as a ""real"" tooth fairy. Under the supervision of his well-meaning but goofily incompetent case worker Tracy (British comedian Stephen Merchant of the original ""The Office"" and ""Extras"") Derek will be cut down to size. Quite literally as it turns out After a costume adjustment and a meeting with basement sprite Jerry (an unbilled but irreplaceable Billy Crystal) Derek gets a hasty lesson in the tools of the fairy trade among them an uncooperative magic wand highly concentrated shrinking paste a can of temporary invisibility spray amnesia dust and a container of Cat-Away. But even so armed Derek learns that being a tooth fairy is much harder than it looks. With his elastic features and chiseled physique Johnson makes the most of the unexpected comedic challenges arising from each mission. Derek even manages to impress his g.f. Carly (Ashley Judd) who sees his new costume as a charming attempt to make up with her daughter. Johnson deftly alternates between his tooth-fairy identity and his minor league hockey-star alter ego eventually deploying the skills of one metier to facilitate his performance at the other. With no fewer than five credited scribes ""Tooth Fairy"" serves as a rebuke to those who would argue that too many writers inevitably dilute a films comic voice. Sharing the bill are writing duos Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (""City Slickers"") and Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia (""That 70s Show"") as well as solo scribe Randi Mayem Singer (""Mrs. Doubtfire""); helmer Lembeck (the two ""Santa Clause"" sequels) also deserves credit for the pics well-buffed tonal consistency. Production values are consistently high throughout the picture. Tooth FairyProductionA 20th Century Fox release presented with Walden Media of a Mayhem Pictures/Blumhouse production.

Dwayne Johnson stars as a cynical minor league hockey player nicknamed the Tooth Fairy (because he knocks out opponents chops) whos transformed into an actual leave-the-cash-under-the-pillow pixie as punishment for nearly robbing his girlfriends daughter of her childhood right to believe in magic. With his mighty thighs bulging through baby-blue tights Johnson works his brawny appeal but he labors for laughs. British comic Stephen Merchant (Extras) however exudes an easier charm as a goofy fairyland caseworker who harbors big dreams of his own.

(Handout) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday January 21 2010 418 PM Title The Tooth Fairy Nearly every recent film made by Dwayne (Still Known As The Rock Despite His Best Efforts To Move On) Johnson can be summed up as follows The script is lousy the direction weak and the star so charismatic that he pulls it all off anyway.Well ""Tooth Fairys"" script -- which was written by five people -- is lousy and the direction by Michael Lembeck is weak. And unfortunately the worse Johnsons material gets the harder he has to work. So though he remains game his charisma is starting to curdle.Johnson plays Derek Thompson a violence-prone hockey player known as ""The Tooth Fairy"" for knocking out a bicuspid here and a molar there. But outside the rink he has no trouble telling his girlfriend (Ashley Judd)s daughter (Destiny Whitlock) that the real tooth fairy is a fantasy. His cynical attitude brings him to the attention of a fairy godmother (Julie Andrews) who punishes him by turning his nickname into a career.Before you know it Johnson is standing before us in a tutu and tights with a wand and pretty wings sprouting out of his back. (Thats as good as it gets so if you dont find that image amusing you might as well give up now.) Despite his outraged protests Derek is assigned a fairy caseworker (Stephen Merchant) to teach him how to collect teeth from under pillows and a wizard (Billy Crystal) to help him do the job.As you may have guessed this is purely synthetic assembly-line stuff with messages like ""Dreams are good for everyone."" As a result Johnson overcompensates amping up his typical enthusiasm until it feels uncharacteristically false. But the supporting cast makes the most of the movies silliness with the goofy Merchant (best known as Ricky Gervais writing partner) having an especially grand time. And ""Fairy"" is certainly a step up from this months other family flick ""The Spy Next Door.""

Stephen Merchant plays his caseworker and Julie Andrews is the Fairy Godmother. ABOUT THE MOVIETooth Fairy 1/2 (out of four)Stars Dwayne Johnson Julie Andrews Stephen Merchant Billy CrystalDirector Michael LembeckDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG for mild language some rude humor and sports actionRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Tooth Fairy will make your teeth ache and your skin crawl. Perhaps the best thing about it is the sight of a hulking Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in a pink tutu and big feathery wings. Otherwise this silly story and barely there comedy is about as enjoyable as a root canal. VIDEO Watch the trailer Johnson has an affable on-screen presence. Its just too bad he rarely puts it to good use in worthy movies. Since the success of 2007s Game Plan Johnson has focused on making fish-out-of-water family films a clever idea given the juxtaposition of his brawny stature with his easygoing likable manner. But this latest foray into the genre is insipid humorless and especially derivative. It plays like The Santa Clause crossed with Elf but without half the appeal of either. The Santa Clause resemblance is no surprise given that director Michael Lembeck was at the helm of The Santa Clause2 and 3. Johnson plays Derek Thompson a hockey player on a Lansing Mich. team coasting on his ferocious ability to extract teeth from opponents. Nicknamed ""the Tooth Fairy"" he hasnt scored a point in a decade nor does he even try. He has a very understanding girlfriend in Carley (Ashley Judd) a single mom to adorable little Tess (Destiny Whitlock) and pouty adolescent son Randy (Chase Ellison). Derek is a has-been who somehow still attracts fans. But given his career trajectory he is quick to dash their youthful dreams of greatness almost immediately upon signing an autograph. He is equally obnoxious with his girlfriends kids. The fairy powers-that-be decide to teach the ""dream-killer"" a lesson. Derek receives a summons under his pillow and is sentenced to two weeks as a winged dollar-dispensing tooth fairy. Billy Crystal has a small cringingly unfunny role dispensing the fairy tricks of the trade such as amnesia powder and shrinking paste. A mint that makes those who swallow it bark like dogs is mined for all the unfunny possibilities imaginable. Perhaps worst of all the estimable Julie Andrews is the Fairy Godmother. She takes Derek to task for ""committing first-degree murder of fantasy"" by denying the existence of the tooth fairy and chides him and his dispatcher Tracy (Stephen Merchant) for ""behaving like leprechauns."" Movies drawing on fairy-tale lore can charm the child in all of us. Enchanted and Shrek were wonderful fairy-tale-inspired treats. But Tooth Fairys blend of dully inspirational sports film bland wannabe heartwarming family saga and inane broad comedy misfires on all fronts. Rather than wit this movie offers thuddingly bad puns and recycled gags. Derek preens in his tutu and asks if it makes his ""butt look big."" Orange-clad ""Fairy Krishnas"" are seen mingling in fairyland. When Tracy mentions the evolution of fairies Derek quips ""Who came up with that? Charles Darwing?"" This just might be the de-evolution of family entertainment. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

These traits should serve him well in Tooth Fairy.Sadly in this forced fantasy about Derek a cynical pro hockey bullyboy who tells his girlfriends young daughter not to believe in the sprite who puts a buck under your pillow when you lose an incisor The Rock is less tooth fairy than toothache.On the ice Derek is a spoiler who prides himself on knocking out the teeth of his opponents. Because of this he spends most of the game in the penalty box. Off the ice he is a bubble-burster who punctures the dreams of all youngsters not only the daughter of his gal pal (Ashley Judd). Because of this he spends most of the time in the doghouse. But hes about to do hard time in Fairyland.Under his pillow (natch) Derek finds a summons from Lily (Julie Andrews) Fairylands Thatcheresque prime minister. She cites him for reckless disillusionment and sentences him to Tooth Fairy detail which is not unlike jury duty except that it requires wearing pastel satin.The sight of the 6-foot-4 Johnson in a pink tutu reminiscent of the hippos in toe shoes from Fantasia is preposterous but not particularly funny. Likewise the countless puns and double-entendres about the he-man being a fairy. Here is a man whose triceps have triceps. How is decking him out as a ballerina any funnier?What with Dereks swings between his day job in Macho-land and his after-hours sentence in Fairyland the film seems positively bipolar. So does The Rocks character who swings from castle-smasher to castle-builder - and who tramples through the film like the Jolly Green Giant on a field of sprouts.Michael Lembeck directs with the subtlety of a sledgehammer pounding every joke and cliche until they are flat flat flat.Its hard to believe that two of the films five () credited screenwriters are Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel whose scripts include such charmers as Splash Night Shift and A League of Their Own. Tooth Fairy is an almost charmless affair made half-bearable by the patient grace of Julie Andrews and the wry humor of Stephen Merchant as the Tooth Fairy instructor.One of the tools Merchants character gives Derek is a memory-erasing powder to sprinkle on kids who might see him in the act of collecting their teeth. I wish I had some of that powder to erase the memory of the film.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + You know what got ""Tooth Fairy made the minute you see it Hey how funny would it be to put Dwayne Johnson in ballerina slippers pink tights and a tutu? Not very. But heres the movie anyway scarcely more than the pitch meeting that spawned it. Johnson plays Derek Thompson a former NHL player now notorious in the minor leagues for his bone-crushing play. His way with opponents dental work has fans calling him the Tooth Fairy. In fact hes such a cross-checking star that the penalty box has a Barcalounger.Dereks gift for crushing the fantasies and professional aspirations of children however particularly the kids of his girlfriend (Ashley Judd) wins him two weeks in a different sort of penalty box. The department of ""dissemination of disbelief whisks him off to a fairy land presided over by the lovely Julie Andrews who descends to earth on an unconvincing set of wings. Hes consigned to serve as a tooth fairy until he believes in dreams himself. The job comes with all kinds of gadgets - invisibility spray a paste that shrinks you down to nothing.It took five writers to get this movie made and one flatulent directing performance from Michael Lembeck. Most of the scenes just sit there on the screen inert. For what its worth ""Tooth Fairy is a somehow dimmer cousin of those Tim Allen ""Santa Clause movies. But the lesson here seems borrowed from a peewee hockey manual - ""You cant win if you dont take a shot - and the hockey playing itself is an embarrassment. So is the movies lame gay subtext. (Heres the end of one exchange allegedly about Facebook ""I love to be poked)As Dereks lady friend Judd is the earnest kind of terrible an actor can be only when playing a mother in a family movie. Everything she does is a variation on ""Oh geez But shes one of the least annoying people here. As the young hotshot on Dereks team the X Games star Ryan Sheckler performs with a bucket of Disney Channel attitude. Derek is also followed around by Andrewss number two played by Stephen Merchant a gangly man whose awkward shtick barely made the children in attendance laugh.But they did laugh mostly at Johnson who having served time in ""The Game Plan  and ""Race to Witch Mountain is irresistible to little people. Beneath those enormous pecs beats the heart of a Muppet. For the moment hes trapped as a mascot for this sort of pre-chewed family entertainment. But Johnsons grins and grimaces seem numbed up here.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Watching modern kiddie comedies its generally better for the soul to look for ways in which the glass is half-full rather than half-empty. Case in point The new Dwayne Johnson vehicle The Tooth Fairy doesnt feature a lot of crotch-slamming farting singing CGI rodents or shrieking children. It does feature Julie Andrews in a welcome return to her usual role as a sweetly benevolent patrician figure. Frequent Ricky Gervais partner Stephen Merchant is pretty funny in his role as a put-upon functionary. Johnson remains a reliably charming presence and one of the kid stars isnt too glutinously precious. For a bad broad comedy Tooth Fairy boasts a surprising number of positives. Which isnt to say that its good but it could be much much worse. Johnson stars as a popular minor-league hockey player nicknamed ""The Tooth Fairy"" because his signature move is knocking out opposing players teeth; as his coach points out hes a show pony not a player but hes reconciled himself to his thoroughly compromised dreams of glory which he actively preaches to everyone around him. Then he heartlessly tells the daughter of his girlfriend Ashley Judd that the actual magical Tooth Fairy doesnt exist. Suddenly he sprouts wings and is whisked off to Fairyland (no really) where caseworker Merchant and head fairy Andrews sentence him to atone by working as a Tooth Fairy largely by engaging in manic slapstick involving a bunch of clumsy CGI. If nothing else The Tooth Fairy keeps the story moving along largely by packing it with a staggering number of plotlines. By the films end Johnson has to patch things up with Judd save his faltering hockey career teach a lesson to an obnoxious young-turk player convince Merchant to believe in himself and become a full-fledged Tooth Fairy and bond with Judds dour prepubescent son boosting his self-esteem enough to get him into the school talent show. And then theres dealing with wackadoodle Tooth Fairy trainer Billy Crystal learning to use fairy magic and collecting all those kids teeth for reasons never explained. Some of these plotlines prove dire in execution especially given that Johnson can pull off ""charming"" ""sincere"" and ""bad-ass"" pretty well but doesnt seem to have settings for ""surprised"" ""scared"" or ""filled with complicated layered angst."" But director Michael Lembeck (The Santa Clause 2 and 3) keeps things brisk and its all over pretty quickly so audiences are rarely given time to reflect on how utterly ridiculous and pointless all this is. That leaves the glass at least a quarter full. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review The Paranoids Next Movie Review Creation Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

(Courtesy of 20th Century Fox) Why do so many family comedies have the quality and consistency of something recently rinsed and spat down an ortho-sink?  ""Lower your expectations"" says the minor-league hockey player to the suddenly disillusioned preteen fan in ""Tooth Fairy."" ""Thats the only way youre gonna be happy."" Well I tried that. But this PG-rated fantasy conceived as a vehicle for the amiable Dwayne Johnson is more or less talking to itself with that line. The posters the funniest thing about the project Johnson sporting a pair of fairy wings larger than his forearms glaring at the camera. Known as ""The Tooth Fairy"" for his ability to knock his opponents teeth all over the rink Johnsons character Lansing Mich. minor-league hockey player Derek Thompson hasnt taken an actual shot at the net for nearly a decade owing to minimal ambition and maximal self-loathing. (Not since Dean Jones in the original ""Love Bug"" has such a paradoxically chipper sourball served as the protagonist of a kids movie.) The real tooth fairies in Molar Sprite Valley or wherever do not like this hockey player who dashes the dreams of young ones so cavalierly. So whoosh hes lifted off to Fairyland where Julie Andrews (with wings) and a weirdly overscaled Stephen Merchant oversee Dereks stint as a ""real"" tooth fairy. His wings sprout at inconvenient times in the locker room or canoodling chastely with his girlfriend played by  Ashley Judd. Destiny Grace Whitlock plays her daughter; in an unusually good performance Chase Ellison offers some real unforced feeling as the lonely son whose music is his passion. And his sarcasm too Thats his other passion. Its a contractual must for sullen teenagers in these PG comedies to lip off like every other sullen teenager in a PG comedy. Directed by the numbers by Michael Lembeck (""Santa Clause 2"" ""Santa Clause 3"" ) the film relies on gimmicks such as Derek learning to use amnesia dust or anti-cat blasters or shrinking paste in order to execute his tooth-fairy duties. The shrinking paste leads to a newly small Derek being pursued by a dino-sized kitten a segment  that may as well carry the subtitle ""Honey I Shrunk the Artist Formerly Known as The Rock."" Johnsons a game and antic presence but saddled with this material -- credited to five screenwriters including Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel -- he comes perilously close to tiring out the audience with all the nervous activity and the mugging. Its an honest instinct Sell the gags even if their sell-by date has expired. Working in a lower key Billy Crystal is good for a chuckle or two as an elder fairy statesmen. Your kids may like some of it or all of it. How should I know? I dont know your kids. Id say the results land square on the action-star-goes-cuddly bubble alongside ""The Spy Next Door"" and ""The Pacifer"" and eons and eons ago  ""Kindergarten Cop.""

Tooth Fairy Bad to fair Director Michael Lembeck. Cast Dwayne Johnson Stephen Merchant Ashley Judd. Rating Rated PG for mild language some rude humor and sports action. RELATED Julie Andrews believes in the tooth fairy and much more Spotlight Dwayne Johnson Wrestlers in movies You hear that Dwayne Johnson is starring in a movie about a tough-guy hockey player who has to do time as the tooth fairy and your eyes begin to glaze over at the mere thought of it. Focus. ""Tooth Fairy"" isnt as bad as you may have feared. Its not all that good either but at least its possible to sit through it and hold down your popcorn. Why? Well Johnson the former wrestler is an agreeable-enough presence and there are plenty of big names in the cast. But the real reason to watch the film if you must is Stephen Merchant. And whos that you ask? If youve ever seen the British version of ""The Office"" or ""Extras"" then youve seen his work (and possibly him). Hes a comedic genius simply put the secret weapon in Ricky Gervais projects though he doesnt get nearly the credit or the recognition he deserves. Showing up here is like Kobe Bryant playing pick-up games in your rec league. Good to have him. Johnson plays Derek a former big-time hockey player now trudging through life in the minors as a thug known as the Tooth Fairy because he knocks other players teeth out in fights or with rough body checks. Hes a realist in the extreme; his cynical shattering of the dreams of a boy who hopes to grow up to be a hockey player is one of the funniest parts of the film because its just about the only thing in it that isnt predictable. Derek is dating Carly (Ashley Judd) who has two children Tess (Destiny Whitlock) and Randy (Chase Ellison). Tess adores Derek but Randys a sullen sort. Carly encourages Derek to spend time with him to bring him out of his shell. Neither Derek nor Randy is thrilled at the notion. Meanwhile Derek steals the money left under Tess pillow when her tooth falls out then takes it upon himself to try to tell her theres no such thing as the tooth fairy. Next thing he knows he has been whisked off to fairy land sporting a pink tutu. Thats where Lily (Julie Andrews) whos in charge of the place breaks the bad news Derek must spend two weeks as the tooth fairy and he cant tell anyone about it or screw it up or hell get a longer sentence. Merchant plays Tracy his caseworker and a wingless fairy; he suffers from wing envy. Billy Crystal has a small role as an ancient fairy who outfits Derek with the gear hell need for his stint - invisibility spray cat repellent shrinking cream etc. (""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane has a funny cameo as Ziggy a fairy who traffics in black-market fairy paraphernalia.) Derek needs to learn to believe in dreams. Randy needs to learn to believe in himself. Hmm. You can probably take it from there. ""Tooth Fairy"" is a strictly by-the-numbers affair except when Merchant is clowning around. He doesnt make you enjoy the film so much as he makes you wish he acted more. Guess thats something.
