With Dennis Quaid Rachel Griffiths Brian Cox. Directed by John Lee Hancock. Running time 129 mins. Rated G. 2 1/2 STARS. When 37-year-old relief pitcher Jim Morris announced his retirement from major league baseball last year it ended a career whose statistics - 15 innings pitched 13 strikeouts 4.80 ERA - dont begin to tell the story. Morris a high-school science teacher lived out the dream of thousands of middle-aged men when he made the roster of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the fall of 1999. Then 35 he was the oldest big-league rookie in 30 years and the first batter who faced him - Texas Rangers shortstop Royce Clayton - went down on three fastballs clocked in the high 90s. Roger Clemens throws that fast but not many others. How Morris got from the oil fields of West Texas and the classrooms of Big Lake High to the Devil Rays roster is the occasion of John Lee Hancocks and Disneys shamelessly proud ""The Rookie."" Unlike some biographical films we could name this is the story of an uncomplicated guy with a big dream and a beautiful arm. ""The Rookie"" which stars a fit 47-year-old Dennis Quaid commits the sin of a hundred sports biographies in overselling its inherent drama. Hancock lingers over on-field cliches trumps up ridiculous emotional crescendos and abides a musical score by Carter Burwell that threatens to carry the movie off on its shoulders before its half over. But where it counts most in dramatizing the anguish/exhilaration cycle of chasing a dream ""The Rookie"" soars. Quaid last seen in uniform playing an aging quarterback in Oliver Stones ""Any Given Sunday"" has a good-ol-boy earnestness and an athleticism that while miles short of pro caliber passes the suspension-of-disbelief test. Morris didnt just appear from behind a Bunsen burner with a gun for an arm. He was a country natural as a teenager and was drafted by the Yankees in 1982. But chronic arm problems derailed him before he got out of the minors. Back home in Big Lake where he began teaching high-school physics Morris doubled as the baseball coach. One year he took a dare from his players who had seen his fastball. The deal was if they won the district championship he would humble himself by trying out for the bigs. They won he tried out and a legend was born. The story really is that simple. As the Tampa Bay scout tells Morris ""When I call the office and tell them I got a guy here that is almost twice these kids age Im going to get laughed at but if I dont call in a 98-mile-per-hour fastball Im going to get fired."" For dramatic purposes ""The Rookie"" is fleshed out with an unconvincing father-son conflict. Morris dad is a retired Navy man (a miscast Brian Cox) who tries to atone for his earlier insensitivity to his sons baseball dreams. More effectively the story lingers over Morris affectionate relationships with his wife (the always compelling Rachel Griffiths) his adorable young son (Angus T. Jones) and the high-school players who urge him on. At two-plus hours ""The Rookie"" is a good 20 minutes too long but for father-son teams waiting eagerly for the umpires ""Play ball"" its an uplifting season opener.

Updated July 30 2016  154 pm Full Forecast Opinion Obits Sports Wine Buy amp; Sell Homes Disney movie The Rookie brings on the heat late in the game By DAVID GERMAIN AP Movie Writer Mar 29 2002 If theres a near fatal flaw to Disneys ""The Rookie"" its that the film takes a timing cue from its real-life subject an average guy finally realizing his major-league dream when hes well on in years. Both the life of Jim Morris and the film inspired by his journey have big payoffs. But theyre a long time coming and thats a problem for a movie catering to family audiences for whom two-hours-plus may be too much when a brisk choice such as ""Ice Age"" is playing in the next theater. Director John Lee Hancock overplays the buildup to Morris second chance devoting two-thirds of the movie to a passably engaging story of high school underachievers whom Morris coaches. The film brings on the heat late in the game though with a gooey but rousing climax that will make many people forget -- or at least forgive -- the 90 minutes of bench-warming its taken to reach it. Though a decade older than Morris was when he entered the major leagues Dennis Quaid ably takes to the mound as the pitcher whose fastball somehow improves with age. After an introduction establishing Morris childhood love for the game his catapult of an arm and his shaky relationship with his emotionally distant father (Brian Cox) ""The Rookie"" skips ahead to 1999. In his mid-30s Morris works as a science teacher in the dusty Texas town where he spent much of his youth and coaches a hapless baseball team of unmotivated teens. ""The Rookie"" languidly introduces the good-hearted small-town folk around Morris and his cheery home life with wife Lorri (Rachel Griffiths) and their three children. Viewers gradually learn Morris had his ball-playing shot in his 20s but was forced out of the minors by shoulder problems. To inspire his losing team Morris makes a pact If his players win the divisional championship hell try out again for a pro team. To his surprise they do and to his amazement he clocks a dozen fastballs in the 98-mph range when he holds up his end at an open baseball tryout. Signed to the farm system for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays Morris finds his groove as a relief pitcher and three months later makes his big-league debut -- on the road in his home state of Texas family and friends thronging the stands. The energy and humor of the final third of ""The Rookie"" makes you wish Hancock and screenwriter Mike Rich had compacted the goats-to-champions coaching part and expanded on the real Cinderella story of Morris professional triumph. Morris ultimately lasted two partial seasons in the majors and the films rendering of his minor-league struggle is so enjoyable you want to see more of that and less of the everyday life preceding it. If this were a fictional tale ""The Rookie"" would be beyond belief. But based on a recent well-publicized sports story the film does have truly inspiring moments and a sense of utter decency reminiscent of ""Hoosiers."" Quaid has a quiet grace as Morris and after a ho-hum decade it would be nice if the actor could imitate his character and score a sleeper hit. In a limited role Griffiths manages nice moments as the not entirely supportive spouse. The breakout star of ""The Rookie"" is cinematographer John Schwartzman best known for such Bay-Bruckheimer bombardiering movies as ""Pearl Harbor"" ""Armageddon"" and ""The Rock."" Here Schwartzman crafts understated exquisite panoramas of rural Texas that lend a degree of timelessness to a contemporary story. Schwartzmans images are especially effective in a quirky cryptic prologue and closing shot that focus on a legend of two nuns who invested in a seemingly barren patch of dustbowl land hoping for an oil strike. Like Morris they rely on St. Rita patroness of impossible causes. ""The Rookie"" a Disney release is rated G. Running time 128 minutes. Two and a half stars (out of four).

Share Tweet In his definitive piece on baseball movies (""No But I Saw The Game"") Roger Angell rightly hails Bull Durham for debunking the bloated mythology and phony uplift that the game tends to inspire and for acknowledging those ""dusty middle innings"" when miracles dont come so cheap. On the continuum with Bull Durham on one end and Field Of Dreams on the other John Lee Hancocks The Rookie occupies that rare spot in the middle tempering a weakness for Quaker Oats Americana with a surprisingly modest and sobering sense of proportion. Hancock--not to be confused with John D. Hancock who managed a similar earthiness with 1973s Bang The Drum Slowly--wages a compelling battle between dreams and responsibilities with a special appreciation for the little footnotes that make the game special. But he gets himself into trouble early ladling on some storybook nonsense about a barren oil field in West Texas that was blessed by nuns with yellow rose petals and soon became fertile ground for black gold and ballplayers. When a prepubescent Army brat (Trevor Morgan) with a cannon-like left arm moves to town local baseball has become a thing of the past remembered only by the old-timers that haunt the department store. In a brilliant touch Hancock shows the lone kid hurling balls against a backstop then cuts to the same shot years later when the kid has become an adult in his late 30s having stayed in the same place as his dreams passed him by. Now a high-school chemistry teacher with a wife (Rachel Griffiths) and three young kids Dennis Quaid coaches a hapless baseball team on a dirt diamond leading a happy life thats tinged with some regret and residual bitterness toward a father (Brian Cox) who never encouraged him. Upon discovering that he still has a live fastball in spite of his age and multiple surgeries the team members strike a bargain If they win district he has to throw at an open tryout for the major leagues. Though Hancock traffics in a lot of bogus small-town sentiment The Rookie exhibits a refreshingly honest understanding of baseball as a job with long road trips away from home and a workmanlike routine that rarely finds room for grand slams and perfect games. This kind of maturity and restraint is unheard of in other Disney live-action films which usually tout the limitless potential of ragtag misfits under the tutelage of B-list celebrities. Touching and wise with fine performances and impeccable widescreen photography The Rookie is a rare family film that encourages kids to pursue their dreams but not before giving full weight to the consequences.

Now a wonderful new movie ""The Rookie"" will be rallying the faithful and bringing the church fresh converts. ""The Rookie"" is right up there with the best and its achievement is all the more impressive because this Disney production clearly conceived as family entertainment carries a G rating which is often a marker for blandness. Dennis Quaid stars in the real-life story of Jim Morris a high-school coach and chemistry teacher in small-town Texas who in his mid-30s suddenly revives his dormant dream of pitching in the major leagues. Mr. Quaid has long been a reliably likable actor but this time he pitches a perfect performance -- no frills no tricks not a single false note -- in a film thats true to its stirring subject and to the sweetest traditions of the game. You know youre in good hands from the first frames of the preface a whimsical bit of Texas folklore about financially astute nuns and ball-playing oil-field riggers; then its almost pure pleasure all the way to the climax though the pace is a bit slow and the running time is slightly too long. (Id bet my Yankees sweatshirt that the studio is to blame for the epilogue which is very slow foolishly cliched and uncharacteristically sentimental but the sogginess comes too late to do serious damage.) As the story begins in earnest -- though never too earnest to miss a droll expression or a quick joke -- Jim is coaching baseball in a part of the country thats obsessed with football on a field of desiccated dreams where the grass cant grow because deer keep eating all the seed. He has a loving wife (a beautifully spare portrayal by Rachel Griffiths) and a flourishing family that includes an eight-year-old son Hunter (Angus T. Jones) who watching his father like a fledgling hawk never crosses the line from genuinely adorable to Hollywood cute. Jim also has a pitching arm supposedly injured beyond repair during an aborted minor-league career that has somehow grown more potent than he himself dares to suspect. This miracle of biomechanics may remind you of a baseball fantasy called ""Rookie of the Year"" though its based on actual events and Jims belated journey to the majors invokes some familiar dramatic devices -- most notably the radar gun though with a clever twist. But what gives ""The Rookie"" its special power and resonance is Mike Richs fine tactful script which focuses on Jim and his high-school players challenging one another to succeed and John Lee Hancocks direction which in its own unhurried way has the sort of control that distinguishes elite athletes. Its hard to understand how a near-rookie developed such technique -- Mr. Hancock an attorney turned producer and filmmaker has directed only one obscure feature before this -- but I can testify to its results. ""The Rookie"" which was shot on location in central Texas passes up every shot at bogus conflict shallow feelings and glib manipulativeness. (If you miss those qualities in a baseball movie you can always rent ""For Love of the Game."") It belabors no plot points hammers home nothing but earned runs with a deep-rooted decency and a fragrant sense of place. This wry inspirational comedy -- when was the last time wry and inspirational went out together and hit it off? -- is not just about bringing the heat though Jim Morris has a 98-mile-an-hour fastball and Dennis Quaid manages to make nearly every pitch look like the real awesome thing. Its about mortality vulnerability and possibility. Brian Cox is chillingly effective as Jims father a stone from which droplets of approval seldom spurt. Leading members of the high-school team are played by Jay Hernandez Angelo Spizzirri Rick Gonzalez and Chad Lindberg. Carter Burwell wrote the lively graceful score. The production was designed by Barry Robison and John Schwartzman did the cinematography which is of a piece with the films honesty and emotional clarity. At one point just after the whoosh and thump of the first flat-out fastball that Jim has unleashed in a very long time the once and future pitcher says with quiet awe ""I forgot how good that sounded."" Until ""The Rookie"" came along Id forgotten how good and smart a family film can be. Panic Room Jodie Foster is a newly divorced mother Meg Altman and Kristen Stewart is her young daughter Sarah in ""Panic Room"" an ingeniously scary thriller directed by David Fincher from a screenplay by David Koepp. Mother and daughter are first seen in a house-hunting expedition on Manhattans Upper West Side where an unctuous real-estate agent showing them through a vast empty brownstone says ""Its a very emotional property."" This proves to be an understatement of vast proportions. One of the brownstones selling points is a panic room a high-tech refuge from disaster or home invasion and whats the point of a movie with a panic room if the home isnt promptly invaded? In two previous films ""Fight Club"" and the box-office-hit ""Seven"" Mr. Fincher demonstrated a spectacular mastery of atmospherics; he even staked out a chrome-yellow slice of the spectrum as his own. But ""Seven"" was stylishly gloomy and ""Fight Club"" was smarmily pretentious while ""Panic Room"" has been admirably stripped down to atmosphere as a function of architecture and action as a consequence of character. Meg and her daughter are anything but passive victims; theyre formidable heroines in a story that makes a feminist statement without a smidgen of detectable feminism. The home invaders are intriguing too Forest Whitakers Burnham a soft-spoken crook with a Hippocratic inclination to do no harm; Dwight Yoakams Raoul an articulate hothead who chills out in a surprising fashion; and Jared Letos Junior a dim but brutal embodiment of the maxim that power flows to the man with the gun. ""We had it all worked out"" Burnham laments when he discovers Meg and Kristin camping out in their newly purchased house. ""No one was supposed to be here."" Mr. Koepps script has it all worked out too but with surprising success and variety given the constricting dimensions of the field of action. Suffice it to say that mother and daughter do not spend the whole movie huddling in their panic room and that their courageous behavior in the face of terrifying odds is mostly believable though you may wonder where Meg learned to splice telephone wires and why she wanted so much square footage on so many floors in the first place. Ms. Fosters performance is a strong one and Megs resourcefulness is rivaled only by that of the two cinematographers Conrad W. Hall and the always-superb Darius Khondji. Their cameras travel with eerie ease through gas pipes and ventilator shafts and trump the old trope of peeping through keyholes by penetrating the innards of deadbolt locks.  DVD TIP Dennis Quaid was a football player with a dream in ""Breaking Away"" (1979) another sports comedy of uncommon charm and integrity set in small-town America. (The town was Bloomington Ind.) Peter Yates directed from Steve Tesichs spirited script about four local high-school graduates looking for the next stage of life.

Deftly constructed to stoke the baseball-phenom fantasies of coulda-shoulda-woulda middle-aged guys and fields-of-dreaming young diamond studs ""The Rookie"" is poised to score major league jack as an out-of-left-field sleeper hit. Disney definitely is swinging for the fences with heavy-hitting promotion -- beaucoup word-of-mouth previews national sneaks and multi-media ad assaults -- doubtless hoping to repeat the success of Mouse Factorys ""Remember the Titans"" another fact based feel-good sports drama. New pic should post equally impressive stats during theatrical innings and ancillary play-offs. Smoothly directed by vet scripter John Lee Hancock (""A Perfect World"" ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"") from a well-crafted screenplay by Mike Rich (""Finding Forrester"") ""Rookie"" celebrates the unlikely achievements of Jim Morris a small town Texas high school baseball coach and chemistry teacher who in 1999 became the oldest rookie MLB pitcher to take the field in 40 years. Pic is divided into two segments. Brief prologue sets the scene in the West Texas oil town of Big Lake and limns the itinerant childhood of young Jimmy (Trevor Morgan) son of taciturn Navy CPO James Morris Sr. (Brian Cox). When father is transferred to post in Big Lake a town where football is preferred Jimmys budding Little League career is rudely interrupted. Flash-forward finds adult Jim (Dennis Quaid) still living in Big Lake coaching the Big Lake High School Owls. Most of the schools sports budget goes to the football team and Jims under-funded under-equipped baseball players are chronic losers. Anxious to boost his players self-esteem Jim extols them to ""follow your dreams."" Some of the players -- chief among them Joaquin ""Wack"" Campos (Jay Hernandez of ""crazy/beautiful"") -- respond in kind Why doesnt Jim take a second shot at realizing his own ambitions? Turns out that Jim had a brief run 10 years earlier in the minors but blew out his shoulder. Fully recovered -- and more important still able to throw heat like a man 10 years his junior -- he claims hes too old and too burdened with family responsibilities to consider another major league job. But his players press so Jim accepts their challenge If they win the district championship Jim will try out for the big leagues. The Big Lake Owls fulfill their end of the bargain with a rousing come-from-behind win. So Jim attends a tryout camp where he amazes the scouts with a fastball that clocks at 98 mph. In short order and despite serious misgivings on the part of his wife Lorri (Rachel Griffiths) hes back in the minors and getting lots of press as the most highly publicized over-age Minor League rookie since Michael Jordan. Everything leads to a shamelessly heart-tugging but undeniably potent climax in which Jim called up as a relief pitcher for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays sees his first major league action in the Ballpark at Arlington (Texas) while half the population of Big Lake cheers in the stands. Closing credits reveal Jim went on to enjoy a two-year MLB career before retirement. Quaid and helmer Hancock are native Texans which may explain why ""Rookie"" is refreshingly free of buffoonish behavior and twangy stereotypes so common to Hollywood dramas set in the Lone Star state. If anything leisurely paced pic errs in the other direction by striving a tad too obviously for sober-sided mythos and all-American iconography. John Schwartzmans attractive color lensing is splendid but there are a few too many beautifully composed widescreen shots of Quaid standing against dry West Texas landscapes and starlit night skies. Worse some glimpses of small town Texas life have the too-perfect look of calendar art. Still Quaids effortlessly compelling and engagingly earnest performance keeps pic grounded in down-to-earth reality. Hes actually about a decade older than Jim Morris was at the time of his baseball comeback but hes in sufficiently great physical shape to pull off the part without straining credibility. More important Quaid never hits a false note while illuminating various facets of Jims character. All in all another superlative job by one of the most reliable and under-rated actors working in contemporary cinema. Griffiths (""Six Feet Under"") works quiet wonders within the limitations of the familiar role of a supportive but not infinitely patient spouse while Cox does his best to hide his characters soft heart behind an intimidatingly harsh exterior. Angus T. Jones (""See Spot Run"") stops far short of kid-actor sickly sweetness and offers a genuinely affecting performance as Jims idolatrous young son. Filmed on Texas locations in and around Austin and Arlington ""The Rookie"" offers an attractive tech package to enhance its straightforward and (except for a few moments of overstatement) intelligently sentimental storytelling. Aptly chosen pop and country tunes on soundtrack run the gamut from Elvis Presley to Nat ""King"" Cole to Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs.

Comments The Rookie In the poetic-baseball-movie tradition of Field of Dreams and The Natural The Rookie is full of the golden glow of baseball diamonds at twilight earnest men talking about their love of the game and carefully engineered emotional moments. Inspired by the true story of pitcher Jim Morris screenwriter Mike Rich develops familiar themes--the struggle of fathers and sons second chances--as he portrays a high school coach in rural Texas who was once briefly in the major leagues. With his bad shoulder Morris (played with understatement by Dennis Quaid) isnt supposed to throw but he still sneaks out in the evening to practice. The kids on his team make him a deal if they win the division hell have to try out again for the majors. They win he tries out and everyones stunned that hes throwing faster than he did at 20. All the uplift could easily get cloying but director John Lee Hancock knows how to keep things in control and the whole is surprisingly satisfying. With Brian Cox. 129 min.

"Warmhearted `Rookie - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Warmhearted `RookieDennis Quaid makes the teamMarch 29 2002|By Mark Caro Tribune movie writer.""The Rookie"" telegraphs its pitches from the very beginning when a folksy voiceover speaks of St. Rita ""patron saint of impossible dreams."" If you dont know youre about to see a movie in which such dreams are fulfilled youve walked into the wrong theater.The rest of us can relax and acknowledge the role of corn in a balanced filmgoing diet. This is a Disney movie after all in the old family-friendly sense of the label though in this case the main character is not a kid but an adult.Based on the real-life tale of Jim Morris ""The Rookie"" tells the inspirational story of a Texas high school science teacher and baseball coach who gets his shot at the big leagues at an age when many players are retiring.The movie has its ""Bull Durham"" elements showing us an older player toiling in the minors alongside young whipper-snappers as he awaits a call to the majors. But the tone is closer to Kevin Costners other baseball movie ""Field of Dreams""; the edges are soft and fuzzy rather than caustic and what happens on the field is ultimately less important and emotionally potent than what happens between father and son.As a kid Jim loves playing baseball but every time he thinks hes settled down with a Little League team his military father Jim Sr. (Brian Cox) has to move the family somewhere else. Ultimately they wind up in a small Texas town where football is the sport of choice and baseball almost doesnt exist.Jims complaints fall on deaf ears; his father tells him with characteristic bluntness (of the movie as well as Jim Sr.) ""There are more important things in life than baseball. The sooner you figure that out the better.""We meet the adult Jim (Dennis Quaid) back in small-town Texas years after what we learn was an abortive baseball career; hed blown out his arm while pitching in the Milwaukee Brewers farm system. Now a well-liked teacher and coach he impulsively airs out a few fastballs to his teams catcher and lo and behold the mitt is going ""pop"" upon impact. The team is decidedly lackluster so the coach makes them a deal If they win the district championship hell give the big leagues another shot.""The Rookie"" is a movie that belies the notion that effective drama hinges on not knowing whats going to happen. Here you often have a good idea of where the action is headed yet it still pulls you along. You can see why the filmmakers optioned the story from a Sports Illustrated article It just works.Quaid has been down the jock road so many times (""Any Given Sunday"" ""Everybodys All-American"" ""Tough Enough"") that you buy him as Morris without much question. Thats a good thing because at age 47 the actor is 12 years older than Morris was when he made his comeback. (Morris is only 38 now.)The movies lingering image is Quaid scrunching up his face like hes biting a lemon peel as he uncorks a 98-mile-per-hour fastball. Quaid plays fierce determination well and shows a nice touch with the father-son dynamics. With his own kids Jim is warmly paternal but when he sees Jim Sr. his shoulders slump and hes once again the child seeking fatherly approval. That said Quaids acting has a what-you-see-is-what-you-get quality. You dont sense many hidden depths in Jim.The fleshy-faced Cox in contrast suggests ambiguity as second nature (his oddly sympathetic pedophile in ""L.I.E."" being the extreme example) and he makes a strong impression here as a distant disciplinarian who seemingly cant escape his own coldness.Rachel Griffiths as usual disappears into her role as Jims wife Lorri whose initial unwillingness to support her husband stems less from her not believing in him than from her not wanting to see him hurt and heartbroken all over again. Some of their early exchanges are bit stilted in Mike Richs (""Finding Forrester"") screenplay -- when Lorri complains ""You cant eat dreams"" you figure Jim would counter that a big-league salary can buy lots of Big Macs -- but the family dynamics become richer as the movie progresses.Director John Lee Hancock who wrote the screenplays for Clint Eastwoods ""A Perfect World"" and ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" makes his big points with little subtlety but he and Rich present some nicely detailed scenes as well Jim trying to gauge his pitch velocity by throwing past a highway patrol car-speed monitor; the Texas townfolk trying to solve the problem of deer eating the grass seed off the infield; Jim changing a babys diapers at the moment the Tampa Bay Devil Rays scouts are calling him over for his tryout.The movie also doesnt turn Jims journey into a parade of successes. Life in the minor leagues is no glamour cruise and in case you didnt notice Jim Morris never became the next Roger Clemens.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesClassic baseball film Bull Durham still relevantMay 24 2014Dennis Quaid tosses a winner in `RookieMarch 24 2002Video?

"USATODAY.com - Love of game puts The Rookie in big leagues Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/29/2002 - Updated 0332 PM ET Love of game puts The Rookie in big leagues By Mike Clark USA TODAY Dennis Quaid portrays 35-year-old Jim Morris who tries to pitch in the major leagues. The studio press release for The Rookie notes that one of its three producers (Mark Ciardi) enjoyed a brief stint with baseballs Milwaukee Brewers in the 80s. And serious sports fans are likely to sit through this Disney drama and realize someone involved has enjoyed a passionate lifelong love of the game. The G-rated movie (a box office test case for ""clean"" live action) is a bit too leisurely for its own good -- a criticism by its detractors of baseball itself. Read more below Stories Review Love of game puts The Rookie in big leagues Gee Studios keen on non-animated family films Quaid settling down after divorce Transcript of chat with Dennis Quaid Video Watch the Rookie trailer But its still an affecting bio of a Texas high school teacher who in 1999 at age 35 became the oldest major league rookie in 40 years. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid) wasnt a household name even to those who live in dugouts but The Rookie reminds you that anyone who makes it to the majors is a member of one of lifes most exclusive clubs. Even when there are lulls the emotions seem authentic and the picture is so lovely toward the end (during what amounts to the final two innings) you almost dont notice the 129-minute running time. The Rookie (out of four) Stars Dennis Quaid Rachel Griffiths Brian Cox Beth Grant Jay Hernandez Director John Lee Hancock Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating G The script by Mike Rich (Finding Forrester) tells of a onetime pitching hopeful who wound up teaching after his baseball career seemed licked by fate an indifferent father (Brian Cox) multiple family moves as a child that always seemed to rip him away from his teams responsibilities as a husband and father (Bull Durhams milieu and babies dont mix) and a blown-out shoulder that needed several surgeries. Then something happened that almost never does. Morris and some local radar guns discovered he could pitch again -- and much harder than before. Constrained or possibly aided by the G rating the movie keeps its eye on the ball. The small-town teen baseball team that goads Morris into a tryout after he coaches them to a championship enjoys a modest celebration no beers no girls. His life at home is pleasingly mundane with just a hint of underlying tension. (Morris wife played by Rachel Griffiths subtly gives in to a minimally rewarded life.) Insults from fans and players -- Morris old-guy status is fair game for ribbing -- are funny but not crude as in many recent sports pics. Quaid is 10 years older than Morris who retired in early 2001. But on the mound he has a smooth baseball-card demeanor while convincing us hes the kind of guy who would delay his tryout to change a Pampers. Director John Lee Hancock and cinematographer John Schwartzman capture the feel of minimalist competition on a field of Texas dirt no rain no grass no grass seed -- but a lot of crazy infield hops. They also touch the heart without being sticky. When Morris enters a major league clubhouse for the first time after having coached against a team called the Roughnecks theres an unlikely emotional moment from a shot of Jose Cansecos just-laundered jersey. The Rookie also has a sweet subsidiary moral appropriate to its G-rated universe. It cautions us to stop and think the next time we get bloodthirsty for our team to bomb some geezer relief pitcher when he enters a tight game. He might have a story too.

Written by John Lee Hancock from a screenplay by Mike Rich. 129 minutes. Rated G. Several theaters. E-mail this article Print this article Baseball movies be they comedy or drama have certain things in common. One theyre designed to make you feel good. Two theyre goofy or sexy or both. (Think ""Bull Durham"" the genres standard bearer.) Also they tend to incorporate some element of the father-son dynamic as in ""Field of Dreams."" Finally it seems that most star Kevin Costner fair or foul. ""The Rookie"" headlined by manly mans actor Dennis Quaid probably wont break Costners hold on the genre. The movie manages to make its mark in a different way and not just with the formula. Here Quaid is paired with ""Six Feet Unders"" vivacious Rachel Griffiths. However she forgoes the wet bathtub antics for dry cereal with three toddlers. It starts not on an emerald-green baseball diamond but a patch of dust until a rusty oil rig and a dilapidated scoreboard appear. And its G-rated which means no cursing sex jokes or unsightly scratching. Yes ""The Rookie"" is a family movie through and through. But its innocent fortitude also makes it great and it soars with palpable sentiment and spirit. ""The Rookies"" factual basis is a mere bonus. Still it boggles the mind that in real life Jim Morris played by 47-year-old Quaid actually made it to the major leagues at 35. Any baseball fan knows this; Morris book ""The Rookie"" was a best seller before it even hit bookstores due to online demand. We know the outcome. But the struggle-filled journey paved with a dream deferred captivates and Quaid and Griffiths shine as they lead us along. The film begins with glimpses of Morris as a boy baseball fanatic practicing his throws religiously. As the son of an itinerant Army officer Morris family moved with little notice and his father shows little affection or support for his big-league dreams. The Texas town the family finally settles in Big Lake doesnt even have a high-school baseball team. Flashing forward we see Morris as a high-school science teacher estranged from his father and coaching a lackluster ball team that handles its long losing streak with self-deprecating humor. After Morris shows off his thundering fast ball the kids make him a wager. If they win the district championships he has to try out for the major leagues. The team dynamic present in every baseball film plays out beautifully here in Quaids portrayal of the deep paternal concern Morris shows his boys and tiny daughter. Director John Lee Hancock relies on Quaids signature tough tenderness to carry the picture placing him in the center of wide shots that capture the Texas landscapes endless expanse. His direction makes the movie feel like a reverie at times coaxing out a tear or two while maintaining the tales authentic feeling. This is a terrific return for Quaid who melds his boyish character with a sad maturity that plays off Griffiths nurturing persona. Their chemistry leads us through this fulfilling tale of Morris longshot chance coming to fruition. Melanie McFarland mmcfarlandseattletimes.com.

Starring Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths. Directed by John Lee Hancock. (VHS and DVD. G. 129 minutes.) ""The Rookie"" is an unusual case a success story whose great strength is in the way it depicts failure. Its an observant and worthwhile film that for most of its running time is a persuasive anatomy of middle-age disappointment -- a particularly American variety involving baseball barren towns and broken dreams. Its the story of Jim Morris a minor-league pitcher who left the game after injuring his arm in his early 20s. More than 10 years later at age 35 Morris tried out again -- this time with a miraculous fastball that got him a major-league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Take that premise add that this is a G-rated Disney picture and you might expect something either naive and corny or a little too chirpy a real-life version of all those baseball fantasies about things like 12-year-old sluggers. Instead ""The Rookie"" is about a guy with a sunburned neck sitting on his porch drinking jug wine the color of Kool-Aid and wondering what might have been. Its about staring off into a Texas landscape in which the dust and flatness are a reflection of ones prospects. The emotion captured throughout is not something as obvious or ephemeral as sadness but something more lingering and subtle -- a deep malaise. Dennis Quaid an actor who has been through the emotional wringer in the past couple of years brings to the role a rug-pulled-out-from-under-him haunted quality that fits. Morris as played by Quaid and emphasized in John Lee Hancocks direction is a functioning member of society a father a schoolteacher and a baseball coach. Yet he remains on some level the walking wounded. Hancock directing his first movie avoids the usual Hollywood style of rushing to the climax but rather lets the movie float along at its own pace. Like a European director he trusts that the story is interesting and fortunately hes right. ""The Rookie"" was billed as an inspirational story but its something better than that. Morris doesnt succeed by grit or pluck but by a freakish bit of luck. Things easily could have gone the other way and the movie in its honesty never lets us forget it.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News If Dennis Quaid comes to your house selling swampland hide the checkbook. Director John Lee Hancock doesnt so much shape ""The Rookie"" as pop it neatly out of a Jell-o mold -- its all a-jiggle with preformed rubbery motifs that include (but arent limited to) the redeeming power of baseball the importance of following your dreams and the cathartic joy that reconciling with an estranged parent can bring. Its the kind of movie that threatens you with its 30s-baked homespun wisdom (""Theres a story told in the town of Big Lake Texas ..."") in its opening voice-over. Damned if Quaid doesnt make us buy it. ""The Rookie"" is based on the true story of Jim Morris played here by Quaid who blew out his shoulder as a promising Minor League draftee in the early 80s. He retired from baseball and settled in a small Texas town raising a family and teaching high-school science as well as coaching the baseball team. In the film the kids he coaches know that despite his aborted career hes still got what it takes (he can throw a ball at up to 98 miles per hour). They make a deal with him If they win their district championship he has to try out for the Major Leagues. If you want the movies last third to be a complete surprise stop reading here. The real-life (and movie) outcome is that Morris in his 30s eventually played several seasons with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays becoming the oldest rookie pitcher in 40 years. ""The Rookie"" is Hancocks directorial debut (previously he adapted ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" and wrote the original screenplay for ""A Perfect World"") and you can sometimes see him trying to steer it out of heartwarming-to-death territory. It moves along pokily especially at first but you at least get the feeling Hancock is trying to allow us time to appreciate the oddly beautiful dried-out colors of Morris corner of Texas shot by John Schwartzman. The music is by Carter Burwell best known for his work with the Coen brothers (including the marvelous soundtrack for ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"") and in places it drives the story along nicely It gets a jolt of life to the tune of Elvis Presleys ""Run On"" when Jim suddenly gets inspired to throw a few fastballs at a team practice sending one after another whizzing into the catchers mitt with a mighty satisfying crack. But elsewhere its as if Burwell and Hancock dont trust their instincts or more crucially dont trust their audience to get the movies antique messages on their own. Jims most triumphant moments are marked by a thick coating of goopy soundtrack music. Elvis apparently isnt considered joyous or momentous enough to carry the action along once things get serious. To his credit Hancock doesnt lavish inordinate amounts of attention on the lush rippling grass of baseball diamonds or the squint-inducing sun smiling down on a bunch of men in tight stretch pants In other words he doesnt resort to cheap mythology as a shorthand for the kind of love baseball inspires in people. Hes more interested in the sight of the solitary Quaid lit by the headlights of his pickup hurling ball after ball at an old wire fence -- they hit with a lonely clang. But Hancock working off a script by Mike Rich (""Finding Forrester"") knows in his heart that its his duty to make an uplifting inspirational picture which is probably why most of the movie has such an unflattering shiny-penny tone. You Might Also Like But then just as an athlete stretches a muscle by subjecting it to resistance that tone gives Quaid something to work against -- sometimes thats how you get fine performances in so-so movies even if its not an actors intention to subvert the material. Here Quaid doesnt make the best of the movies baloney; he presents it to us as a believable truth. Quaid who has dropped out of the movie scene for patches that have sometimes stretched far too long is aging beautifully although that may not be the same thing as well. He has none of the beaming wholesome goodness of say Kevin Costner; his bad-boy impishness hasnt disappeared but now it comes across as a weatherbeaten glow thats survived against all odds not as an actors trick to ensure that he remains an eternal heartthrob. But if theres a new roughness to Quaids face theres a new openness as well as if the irresistible gunslinging arrogance of his Gordo Cooper in ""The Right Stuff"" had rubbed up against more than its share of doubts and insecurities over the years. Quaid reveals layers of feeling that he might not have been able to show us 15 years ago. His Jim is a devoted father of three and while his oldest is an adorable 8-year-old who loves baseball and beams like a firefly through the whole movie his youngest is a fussy blond baby doll whos rarely seen without teary red-rimmed eyes. Shes almost a running joke in the movie; her parents adore her of course but they dont for a minute try to fool themselves that shes easy and Quaid plays the role more like a real dad than a moviefied one. When she pokes her fingers at his mouth he playfully snaps at them but you catch a mischievous crocodile gleam in his eye an acknowledgment that she sometimes sorely tries his patience. Quaids job here is to play a man who is happy enough raising a family in a small town but who nonetheless harbors a dream. The idea is sentimental but Quaid dries all the sappiness out of it. Theres something in his face that suggests both contentment and restlessness but even more important the sense that its perfectly natural (and understandable) for the two to coexist in all of us. Thats what makes his moments of joy -- the swollen music on the soundtrack notwithstanding -- seem pure and wholly believable. When his wife (played with perfunctory can-do spunkiness by Rachel Griffiths) shows up at his first Major League game and reaches down from the stands to greet him he stretches up eagerly to reach her. Hes been away for three months toiling in the minors and the look on his face is a mixture of relief and joy at seeing her. But more significantly he shows sudden amazement at how far hes come -- as if it hadnt occurred to him until precisely that moment he saw her face. If you want to see how an actor plays a married man its Quaid in that moment. Any serviceable actor can look at a woman and show devotion and loyalty. It takes a terrific one to show a sense of surprise at who he has become. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

Running time 127 minutes. Rated G. At the E Walk the Union Square Cinema 1 others. ------- THE underrated Dennis Quaid hits a home run with ""The Rookie"" an honest-to-gosh feel-good sleeper that demonstrates truth sometimes really is stranger than fiction. The veteran actor gives a career-best performance as Jim Morris a 35-year-old high school chemistry teacher who in 1999 pulled one of the great sports comebacks of all time. As a young man Morris was a pitcher in the minors - but his dreams of Major League Baseball were dashed by an injury that required major surgery. Years later coaching the school team in his hometown of Big Lake Texas Morris discovered by a fluke that he could still throw fast balls. He makes a deal with his team of perpetual losers If they make it to the state finals hell reluctantly try out for the majors. Amazingly the squad delivers - and Morris dutifully drives to the Texas camp of the Tampa Devil Rays farm clubs. There he astonishes everyone especially himself by hurling flamers at an amazing 98 mph. Jims wife and the mother of his two young sons Lorri (Rachael Griffiths of ""Six Feet Under"") understandably has reservations when he accepts a contract. But in a few months hes pitching in the big leagues - and half the towns population including Jims never-encouraging father (Brian Cox) shows up for his lump-in-the-throat debut with the Texas Rangers. Definitely not a movie for the glucose-intolerant ""The Rookie"" celebrates determination forgiveness and the virtues of small-town America (Big Lake even has a closed Last Picture Show that formerly featured ""Bang the Drum Slowly"") in most entertaining fashion. John Lee Hancock a screenwriter (""Remember the Titans"") turned director gets solid performances from his cast and an extraordinarily assured one from Quaid who is 12 years older than the real-life Morris was at the time - and makes you extremely grateful they didnt cast Kevin Costner in the part. Hancock stages more than competent baseball scenes but he could have taken a firmer hand with Mike Richs script which meanders past the two-hour mark thanks to a needless prologue and way too many shots of Jims adoring young son (the adorable Angus T. Jones). These are minor quibbles about the G-rated ""The Rookie"" which otherwise qualifies as perfect family entertainment.

"Rookie The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rookie-the ) Rookie The (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its very easy to wax poetic about the sport of baseball and Im not just talking ""Mighty Casey has struck out."" Baseball may not be the most popular sport in North America but it has a history and mythology like no other. The giants of past eras tower above reality standing as tall as Paul Bunyan. At times its hard to remember that there were real men named Babe Ruth Lou Gehrig and Cy Young. A good baseball movie embraces the magic of baseball and uses the game as a metaphor for life. Such is the case with The Rookie and while this outing will not challenge the likes of The Natural for the title of the best baseball movie ever made its a solid effort in its own right. Jim Morris is a southpaw who spent parts of two seasons in the bullpen for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. His career statistics - a 4.80 ERA 15 IP 13 K and 9 BB - are hardly the stuff of which legends are made. Yet in spite of that Morris is the subject of Disneys The Rookie - not because of what he did once he reached The Show but because he reached there in the first place. The unlikeliest of heroes Morris became the second-oldest rookie ever to play Major League baseball when he stepped on the mound at the age of 35. A longer-than-long-shot with a story to inspire the most blasA(c) individual Morris tale is a testament to the age-old saying that dreams can come true if you fight hard enough for them. The Rookie is faithful to its source material - the novel co-written by Morris and Joel Engel. It starts out in the 1970s as a young Jimmy Morris (Trevor Morgan) arrives in the small town of Big Lake Texas. Jimmys a baseball fan but football not baseball is king in Big Lake. Flash forward to 1999 Jim (Dennis Quaid) is now married and has three kids. Hes the coach for the local high school baseball team the Big Lake Owls - a post he took after an arm injury ended his quest to break into Major League Baseball. However while Jimmy is throwing batting practice his players notice that his fastballs have a lot of zip on them so they make a deal with him - if they win the district hell attend a big league tryout. Sure enough when the season is over the Owls have fulfilled their part of the bargain so Jim throws in front of some scouts for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. When his velocity reaches 98 mph on the radar Jim suddenly becomes the hottest prospect around - even at age 35. The Rookies lead Dennis Quaid belongs to the Kevin Costner school of acting which is to say that he can be effective in a role as long as he isnt required to stretch beyond the strong silent persona. And much as the part of an overachieving baseball player has proven to be a fit for Costner such is the case for Quaid who settles nicely into Morris shoes and presents him an affable man who is trying to balance his responsibilities as a father and husband with the need to take one last shot at his lifelong dream. To complicate matters Morris sour relationship with his own cold father (Brian Cox) factors into every decision he makes. In supporting roles Cox is good as the aging man who regrets his inability to be there for his son and as Morris wife Lorrie Australian actress Rachel Griffiths adds another impressive turn to a varied resume. The genuine Morris has a cameo as an umpire. In real life major league baseball has lost it innocence. Too often the sport seems to be defined by big-market teams buying high-priced free agents acrimonious labor negotiations greedy owners crying poverty and crybaby players wanting their way. Only in the movies it seems can we re-discover the magic and majesty of the game. In The Rookie theres a wonderful scene in which Morris first sets foot in Arlington Stadium as a player and regards his surroundings with an awe normally reserved for the Cistine Chapel. Hes here for the love of the game and in competing to finally reach the end of the rainbow. As inspirational stories go this one is top-notch. It satisfies without becoming cloying or going over-the-top. Director John Lee Hancock has a sense about how far he can take the formula without making The Rookie seem too overfamiliar. Sure weve seen this kind of story before but perhaps not told in exactly this way with these people. From a technical perspective the films baseball sequences are virtually flawless. This doesnt guarantee a good movie but it helps. The game action is rigorously accurate and Morris first real-life major league strikeout victim Royce Clayton re-creates history by playing himself. More important than the films verisimilitude however is its structure. It manages to be uplifting without forcing us to endure a ninth-inning come-from-behind victory. Because when it comes down to it The Rookie isnt as much about wining in a game as it is about winning in life.

The Baylor Law School grad and former Houstonian has his heart in the right place waving flags for baseball motherhood and Texas pride. But he also makes rookie mistakes eschewing a lighter touch in favor of adulation and letting a predictable yarn of athletic redemption lumber along for 130 minutes. When its not glorifying baseball and Texas myths The Rookie zips like a good fastball showing the sweet honest home life of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid) wife Lorrie (Rachel Griffiths) and their three kids. After arm surgeries in his 20s Morris gave up his major-league dreams and settled for a quiet life teaching -- and coaching baseball -- in a small West Texas town. (Central Texas Thorndale stands in.) His sad-sack team cant win a game. But when the boys learn Morris can still throw heat they challenge him If somehow they can win district hell try the majors one last time. After their unlikely yet inevitable triumph Morris makes his pitch and the big leagues call. Since the film hinges on his major-league dreams some viewers may wonder why this sparks no celebration. But as it unfolds Morris first must trudge through minor-league proving grounds earning less money than he did teaching. This accounts for his initial anguish about leaving his family to pitch professionally. Luckily for him his wife is loving and supportive. An Australian Griffiths doesnt overplay a Texas accent and shes nurturing and strong in a Laura Bush mold. ""Im a Texas woman"" she reassures her husband ""which means I dont need the help of a man to keep things running."" Though not the warmest actor true Texan Quaid exudes family-man decency and his pitching looks credible for a guy who didnt play hardball at Bellaire High. (A lefty like Morris Quaid was coached by former big-leaguer Jim Gott and by Morris himself.) The Rookies awe for major-league stature is undercut by the fact Morris team-in-waiting is the Tampa Bay Devil Rays a sorry franchise both on the field and at the gate. The film also clumsily plays out a stunted father-son relationship. In a long intro Morris as a kid (well-played by Trevor Morgan) is treated with cruel harshness by his military-man dad (Brian Cox). This father doesnt deserve his sons grudging devotion yet were supposed to get all tingly about possible reconciliation years later. Hancock nicely punches up screenwriter Mike Richs Last Picture Show sentiments photographing the small town with rustic glows and filling it with funny folksy locals. When Morris family rolls into town in the 70s inspirational baseball film Bang the Drum Slowly is on its movie marquee. It was directed by John D. Hancock -- no relation. Like the same studios The Princess DiariesThe Rookie also from Disney deserves credit for embracing a G rating. Many films deliberately use a curse word or two to get a PG and not appear saccharine. But Gs stigma may be fading. The Princess Diaries earned 108 million last year when only one of the top 10 money-makers (Hannibal) was R-rated. Hancock could have taken a cue from his rating and focused more on family while compressing his reverence for baseball as a metaphor for life. From The Natural to Field of Dreams to For Love of the Game such solemnity has been batted into the ground. Besides Morris heartening tale is an easy enough sell and it should snap to its finish like a crisp pitchers duel. As they say leave em laughing -- or sniffling.

The reasons are always the same It didnt test all that well; it resists being neatly categorized; it probably wont make much money even if the studio could figure out how to peddle the thing. Such a film is a conundrum for the honchos -- the same virtues that make it good make it hard to market. Such a film is The Rookie. Rarer still The Rookie is a sports movie a notoriously tricky genre with a success rate lower than my Little League batting average (trust me not a pretty figure.) Although this one happens to be based on a true story -- middle-aged guy gets a miracle shot at the big time -- its narrative arc is the mythic stuff of fiction cultivated in works such as The Natural and Damn Yankees. And that myth is tailor-made to the frustrated jock (or dancer or pianist) in all of us -- the one that says it aint over till its over the one that has some decrepit dreamer shucking off his anonymity and his youthful self magically resurrected moving onward and upward straight to The Show. Typically this sort of yarn makes for awful pictures not because the content is pathetic -- after all resurrection myths come with a lofty imprimatur -- but because the presentation is so lame. The high notes are hit way too hard and the cringe factor proves embarrassing to those of us who are already embarrassed by the lingering presence of our inner child -- the kid who still aspires to ""play"" for a living. We want to believe in the fairy tale but the teller makes it impossible. This is precisely where The Rookie shines -- simply by not falling into the trap of overselling what we guiltily want to buy. Yes the particular story here is rooted in reality and that helps sustain our interest but only a little -- a lot of bad movies have been based on true stories especially true sports stories. Instead the key to success is the consistent refusal of both Mike Richs script and John Lee Hancocks direction to gild the lily. Quite the opposite. The picture keeps creeping up to the mythic moments -- the big break the big game the big victory -- only to submarine them to shut down and quietly underplay the entire scene thereby giving us leave to believe. The setting itself is cut from the same minimalist cloth. Were in a dusty rural Texas out of The Last Picture Show. There Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) teaches chemistry at the local high school and coaches the baseball squad on the side. Since this is rabid football territory Morriss team gets short shrift. They play on a dirt diamond and huddle between innings in a chainlink dugout fraught with holes. The ragged uniforms their scuffed spikes the small-town vistas -- its all caught by Hancocks camera with a realism all the more credible for being so casual and unshowy. Realistic too and in the same fashion are the baseball sequences themselves not only at the amateur level but through to the professional climax. And how do we get there? Well Morris has a no-nonsense wife (Rachel Griffiths) three demanding children a rancorous father and of course a frustrated dream. A decade ago he pitched at the minor pro level only to injure his arm and end his career. But the arm doesnt ache any more. In fact (cue the miracle) the arm is cutting loose with fastballs that would be the envy of Roger Clemens. So his student players make him a deal We win the district championship you go for a major-league tryout. They do he does and the rest should be pure hokum. But it isnt. The saving graces are many. Partly its the quality of the dialogue naturalistic and easy the kind that sees husband and wife sitting on the front porch the kids safely in bed an uncorked bottle on a table between them and he saying to her in the joking tone that a happy marriage breeds ""Ah theres nothing like wine bought with a Chevron credit card."" And partly its the quality of the performances that good dialogue encourages. Quaid is intense without being unduly macho Griffiths is supportive without being stereotypically soft while Brian Cox and Beth Grant submit a lovely pair of cameos as Morriss mismatched parents. Finally redemption arrives at the deft hands of Hancock. Consider just the tryout scene which most directors would shamelessly inflate The old coot dazzling the young turks; cut to a scout holding the radar gun his eyes popping at the printed-out velocity; let the score swell as large as a superstars ego. But Hancock does none of this choosing to register only a mild undercurrent of surprise that ripples through the camp. Athletes arent easily impressed and Morris receives nothing more than this muttered acknowledgment from a grizzled manager ""Theres a chance you might get a call on this."" I dont meant to commit the sin the movie studiously avoids and overhype the result. This isnt a brilliant picture. But it is impressively solid and a pleasure to watch almost the equal of such baseball classics as Bang the Drum Slowly and Bull Durham (both of which are paid homage to here.) Indeed The Rookie is the embodiment of the very message it so modestly conveys -- its the accomplished little guy we fervently root for.

The Rookie Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2002) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-rookie-2002,200,therookie23,therookie,rogerebert
"Rookie Wins Without Throwing Curves - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEWS Rookie Wins Without Throwing CurvesStarring Dennis Quaid the emotional story about a late-blooming pitchers improbable but true success never pushes too hard.March 29 2002|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES STAFF WRITER Its only fitting that ""The Rookie"" tells the true story of an athlete who achieved improbable success because this is a film that overcomes considerable odds itself.Against all expectations the Dennis Quaid-starring ""Rookie"" turns out to be an unapologetically emotional film that doesnt make you gag one that manages to be sentimental without turning into a shameless wallow.As described in Sports Illustrated and in a column by Times sportswriter Bill Plaschke the saga of pitcher Jim Morris defies plausibility. A 35-year-old West Texas high school science teacher and coach whose baseball dreams had ended 12 years earlier Morris became the oldest major league rookie in decades after being goaded to try out by his players.The Walt Disney organization never one to miss a marketing trick is pushing ""Rookie"" as being from ""the studio that brought you Remember the Titans."" This may be a crafty sales technique (""Titans"" was a considerable success) but it is regrettably misleading as well. With its old-fashioned feeling quiet confidence and an almost unheard-of G rating ""Rookie"" has more in common with something like ""October Sky"" than the excessively shameless and simplistic ""Titans.""No one of course should expect an austere somber piece of work from director John Lee Hancock and writer Mike Rich. ""The Rookie"" is not above providing assorted Hallmark moments about following your dream or casting the cutest kid imaginable (Angus T. Jones) as the Morrises 8-year-old son Hunter. The film in general promotes the pleasant fantasy that the world is basically a decent place where events and people right themselves if given half a chance.Yet what characterizes ""The Rookie"" is that this fantasy is largely honestly earned. Both debuting director Hancock who wrote the Clint Eastwood-Kevin Costner film ""A Perfect World"" and screenwriter Rich whose feature debut was the treacly ""Finding Forrester"" have managed not to push too hard here. Theyve given ""The Rookie"" a lovely relaxed feeling that makes us happy to be in this films company while allowing us to trust that it wont muck things up with glibness or excess.Also helping to keep everything in balance is the cast starting with Dennis Quaid a Texas native himself and able as always to project a rugged effortless decency. The equally reliable Rachel Griffiths plays his wife Lorri and the protean Brian Cox memorable in darker roles ranging from ""Manhunter"" to ""L.I.E."" brings the right touch of implacability to Morris unbending father Jim Sr. Even the smaller parts like the players on Morris high school team have been smartly cast by Ronna Kress.After a brief introduction establishing Big Lake Texas as a place smiled on by ""St. Rita the patron saint of impossible dreams"" ""The Rookie"" breaks its story into a trio of dovetailing sections each of which deals with different kinds of dreams.Up first is an extended flashback revealing Jim Morris childhood as a Navy brat forced to move frequently as a consequence of his fathers job as a Navy recruiter. The senior Morris is oblivious to if not actually contemptuous of his sons dreams of athletic glory ""There are more important things in life than baseball"" he growls ""and the sooner you figure that out the better.""The Morrises last move takes them to Big Lake a football-crazy town that barely knows baseball exists. There we pick up the adult Jim Morris who is happily married and largely content with his job as a science teacher-baseball coach. Largely but not totally.For Morris whose minor league career ended after four shoulder operations still goes out late at night and throws hard at a deserted backstop. His childhood dream we see is still eating at him and the look on his face as he lets the ball go--faster it turns out than he knows--shows how much bottling up that ambition has cost him.When Morris chides his team after a lopsided loss making the classic ""you quit on me and worse you quit on yourselves"" speech and talks to them about not giving up on their dreams the kids challenge him about giving up on his. Finally a pact is made If his perennially losing team gets to the state playoffs Morris will go to a major league tryout. (Apparently this really did happen.)It doesnt take a soothsayer to figure out what happens from here on in but ""The Rookie"" doesnt shortchange the difficulties involved for Morris his wife his team even his estranged father. The pleasure of a film like this is not in wondering where its going to go but in knowing its exact trajectory. Getting us to pull for a foregone conclusion as if the outcome was in serious doubt is no small sleight of hand.MPAA rating G.

In The Rookie Dennis Quaid stars as the real-life Morris who in 1999 defied the odds - and his own injury-ridden past - to become the oldest rookie major-league pitcher to walk out on the mound in four decades.A glowy wide-screen paean to the tao of anything-is-possible-if-you-get-off-your-butt-and-do-it - and to the slow-motion splendor of the national pastime - The Rookie is imbued with some of the awe-headed hokum of baseball movies such as Field of Dreams and The Natural. At its best though in the messy kitchen of Morris modest home or on the dusty school diamond with the oil rigs seesawing in the background the movie conjures up the taste of something real.The music too rings with a true twang featuring songs by Guy Clark Steve Earle Willie Nelson John Hiatt and Elvis. Also Quaids windup looks pretty good and his slanting-shouldered gait has an achy authenticity.The Rookie begins pokily and unpromisingly with a prologue about a charmed patch of Texas soil a pair of nuns a patron saint and a gusher of oil. Then cut to a look at Morris as a boy a Navy brat whose dad (Brian Cox) was forever being reassigned. The only constant in Jims peripatetic childhood playing baseball.Morris ended up staying in one of those Navy-base towns Big Lake Texas where he finds a job teaching about protons and neutrons and coaching baseball. Married with kids (Rachel Griffiths from Six Feet Under brings way more substance to the part of the wife than the script has given her) Morris has settled into a comfortable routine. His team isnt very good nor is his salary and he still doesnt get along with his stern now-divorced dad. But things could be a lot worse.Its a pact he makes with his team a challenge that starts things going If his kids perennial losers who play a brand of messy absent-minded baseball win the district championship then the coach - who had shown a lot of promise as a college player - has to try out for the pros. Lo and behold the Big Lake Owls are on a winning streak and one day Morris finds himself driving 1 1/2 hours to San Angelo for the tryouts. A dozen straight pitches clocked at 98 m.p.h. later Jim Morris science teacher and dad is being courted by big-time scouts.The Rookie directed by native Texan John Lee Hancock (screenwriter of A Perfect World producer of My Dog Skip) is cornball. And its rife with wide-screen silhouetted-against-the-sunset montages of Morris hurling those fastballs. But its hard not to get caught up in this improbable but true follow-your-dream tale.Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.The Rookie  (Out of four stars)Produced by Gordon Gray Mark Ciardi and Mark Johnson directed by John Lee Hancock written by Mike Rich photography by John Schwartzman music by Carter Burwell and various artists distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.Running time 2 hours 7 mins.Jim Morris. . .

"`Rookie Drives One Across The Heart - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Rookie `Rookie Drives One Across The HeartMovies - REVIEW - The RookieDennis Quaid Is Appealing As A Teacher Who Gets A Chance To Live His Big Dream.March 29 2002|By Roger Moore Sentinel Staff WriterMovies about baseball like the game itself work best when they reduce the complex to the simple. And at its most elemental baseball is just a pitcher trying to throw the horsehide past a batter.The Rookie does that reducing the game to a pitchers story and a tale of dreams deferred. Get past the schmaltz the overdone fastball sound effects and the predictable laughs and what youre left with is an electric moment in one mans life. Despite failed ambitions and occasional servings of corn The Rookie manages to be both appealing and true to the game.Dennis Quaid plays Jim Morris a high school science teacher and baseball coach whose dreams of baseball glory ended years before. He was a Navy brat whose unsympathetic recruiter-father (Brian Cox of L.I.E.) moved the family too many times to count. Jim wound up a baseballer in football-mad west Texas. And thats where he stayed. Injuries ended his long-odds shot at making the bigs.Now in his mid-30s hes trying to motivate a mediocre high school team to glory. He starts tossing batting practice and it feels good. His boys cant hit him. But the tough pitching makes them better. And the wiseacres on the team make Morris a bet. If they can make the state playoffs he has to go try out one last time for a big-league club.Its a far-fetched tale but true as any Tampa Bay Devil Rays fan can tell you. Morris tried out for the then-new franchise and discovered that his much-repaired arm was throwing smoke. He became a Devil Rays relief pitcher if only for a season or so. He got to live his dream.The Rookie has ambitions of reaching for myth and poetry of tying itself to that eternal bond between fathers and sons. It fails in those. What it has are a trio of subtle performances humor and a humble sense of just what Morris accomplished and what it meant to him.Quaid well into his 40s still can pull off playing an athlete. His muscular scowling ruggedness has taken on a rawboned veneer. He looks like an Okie which suits the terrain that much of the film is set in. If director John Lee Hancock who adapted Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and produced My Dog Skip spends too much time on shots of Quaid staring off at the horizon or frowning at the backstop hes pitching to its because he recognized what his films biggest asset was and worked it. Quaid plays Morris as stoic resigned to obscurity and drudgery someone who has to be nagged into daring to dream the dream again.Rachel Griffiths of Hilary and Jackie does deft work as Lorri the wife who encourages her man to take his shot. Its an effortless performance captured in an instant where she opens the door to their very-lived-in home her arms loaded with groceries and kicks her shoes into the corner as if she has been doing it for years.And Cox gives interesting shades to a character who doesnt have many scenes. Jim Sr. isnt and wasnt mean. He was just wrapped up in his work and uncaring of his sons sports ambitions.The story plays tricks with our expectations dwelling at length on Jims childhood then switching to his present reality. It builds us up to a ""big game"" which then happens one third of the way into the movie. The pitching is only reasonably convincing with the obligatory ""swoosh"" to add blinding speed to pitches that dont have it. The inherent sentimentality keeps it from sliding into Bad News Bears territory. And none of the young players makes much of an impression.What works? The predictable moments where the family man ready to pitch for major-league scouts has to stop and change a diaper and the depiction of the grind that the minor leagues can be with stops in Orlando and Durham. And theres genuine drama in the long wait for that bullpen phone to ring for that chance to come out in front of a huge crowd and do your thing.This is not Field of Dreams or even Bull Durham. The Rookie is the baseball version of Rudy a story about aiming for one goal and discovering the side benefits to be had when youre grabbing at something that is almost certainly out of reach.And theres a droll irony to this story of a man from one corner of baseballs nether reaches aspiring to play for St. Petes Devil Rays another town where baseball goes to die.
