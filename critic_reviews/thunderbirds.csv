Comments Thunderbirds Based on the popular sci-fi TV series which featured uniformed marionettes cruising around in spaceships this 2004 live-action feature actually has less of a pulse than the puppet version. Theres enough special effects razzle-dazzle to distract the average ten-year-old but the script by William Osborne and Michael McCullers is stilted and humorless--a little camp might have helped. The decision to foreground the doings of a trio of teenagers at the expense of the regular characters will maximize the boredom for even the most nostalgic adults. Ben Kingsley does some perfunctory scenery chewing as the heavy; Bill Paxton just looks anxious to collect his paycheck. Directed by Jonathan Frakes. With Brady Corbet and Sophia Myles. PG 95 min.

We loved the fantastical rescue vehicles that the Tracy clan employed to carry out its adventurous missions and also the way Tracy Island - their high-tech headquarters - would transform itself into a take-off and landing platform. Yet we rarely objected to the fact that it was all constructed out of cardboard and string. But that was then. Todays youngsters know better than to sit through a corny puppet show which is why theyll be chuffed to learn there are no strings attached in Jonathan Frakess CGI-equipped live-action remake. It looks authentically Technicolor-esque and at least two cast members - Sophia Myles secret agent Lady Penelope and her chauffeur Parker (Ron Cook) - are spot on embodiments of their puppet originals.And so to the main substance of the film which quite frankly resembles Swiss cheese. Jeff Tracys son Alan is eager to join his father and older brothers on their rescue missions but hes just not old enough; which is why hes mostly island-bound. Rather handily for Alan a megalomaniac known as The Hood (Ben Kingsley) has set up a hoax alarm from space and Jeff and the boys have taken the bait leaving them stranded for much of the film while Alan and a few mates thwart Kingsleys bank robbery plans in true Enid Blyton fashion. What impenetrable overwrought codswallop this ones turned out to be. Lest you start frothing at the mouth I advise dropping the kids off at the box office and getting the hell out of there.

Fun at times and tedious at others its an action-adventure fantasy aimed particularly at gadget-loving boys. It has some of the kid-power action sequences of Spy Kids but none of that earlier films charm and little of its humor and sweet message. (Related story Thunderbirds brings TrekHospital icons together) Suppose that thing goes faster than Anakin Skywalkers ride in Star Wars The Phantom Menace? Universal Pictures Based on a British TV series Thunderbirds stars Bill Paxton as Jeff Tracy who heads a family of superheroes and Ben Kingsley as The Hood a megalomaniacal villain. Tracy has a passel of strapping sons ranging in age from mid-teens to well into their 20s who aid him in saving the world from a host of disasters and cataclysms. They are assisted in their efforts by a lovely artisto-spy named Lady Penelope (Sophia Myles). ABOUT THE MOVIE Thunderbirds   (out of four) Stars Bill Paxton Ben Kingsley Anthony Edwards Brady Corbet Director Jonathan Frakes Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG for intense action sequences and language. Opens Friday nationwide Four of the sons swaggeringly accompany their father on a mission to a space station while the youngest Alan (Brady Corbet) an early teen is left out of the fun because of his youth. But while on vacation from his tony prep school he gets his shot at the big time (while his older sibs and dad are off averting another catastrophe) when The Hood derails a monorail plunging it underwater. Alan and his pals Fermat (Soren Fulton) and Tin Tin (Vanessa Anne Hudgens) rescue the trapped people and prove theyre just as competent as Alans older brothers. The movie has added or modified a few characters from the television series. Fermat who is the son of Brains (Anthony Edwards) was a much older man in the original series. Also younger and transformed into a youthful love interest for Alan is the spunky Tin Tin the gardeners daughter. Though Thunderbirds story is formulaic its look is a blend of futuristic and retro production design reminiscent of the Jetsons TV series. At least that makes Thunderbirds visually arresting.

THUNDERBIRDS30 (L to r) Tin-Tin (VANESSA ANNE HUDGENS) Alan Tracy (BRADY CORBET) and Fermat (SOREN FULTON) attempt to hotwire a communications transmitter in the family action-adventure Thunderbirds. Flash forward to a kid-friendly film version of Thunderbirds 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Thunderbirds Action movie. Starring Bill Paxton Ben Kingsley Brady Corbet Sophia Myles and Anthony Edwards. Directed by Jonathan Frakes. (Rated PG 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Making a movie out of the 1960s childrens show ""Thunderbirds"" seems at the outset to be an impossible mission. If producers lovingly re-create the bizarre marionettes and Flash Gordon- era spacecraft from the cult hit kids wont understand it. If they turn it into a modern blockbuster the other half of your box office draw -- geeky 45-year-old Brits who still collect action figures -- will boycott as well. The makers of the new ""Thunderbirds"" film bet on the kids jettisoning many of the old TV programs quirky qualities while ramping up the ""Spy Kids"" vibe and focusing on the shows younger characters. The end result is a fun afternoon for preteen moviegoers that has just enough charm humor and game- for-anything actors to keep parents halfway interested as well. The premise of ""Thunderbirds"" still works after all these years and its positive message is backed with a plot that includes no gunfire -- even coming from the bad guys. Its the year 2065 and Jim Tracy (Bill Paxton) is a former astronaut and billionaire who used his fortune to create an island fortress and fleet of rescue vehicles. More in the spirit of the Red Cross than any military force Tracy his older sons and a British ally named Lady Penelope (Sophia Myles) jet around the world saving people from disasters. Shortly after the main characters are introduced most of them are placed in mortal peril and the youngest and most tempestuous son Alan (Brady Corbet) must save his family from a Tracy-hating villain called The Hood (Ben Kingsley). Director Jonathan Frakes (""Clockstoppers"" ""Star Trek Insurrection"") doesnt have a resume that instills confidence but the former ""Star Trek The Next Generation"" co-star is a good hand for this straightforward material. The production design is cheap but imaginative with futuristic toys awash in primary colors and a network of laboratories that seem as if they were culled from the dream of a Lego-loving 10-year-old child. It appears that Frakes imported many of his special effects from his ""Next Generation"" years -- Tracys space ship in particular looks like a water rocket -- but the director accomplishes the tough task of making sure none of the actors phones it in. Wearing black eye shadow and a kimono Kingsley couldnt be further from ""Gandhi"" (""There goes the cavalry. But who will rescue the rescuers?"") -- and he still avoids self-parody. Paxton is appropriately puppet-like as the stern father and Myles plays a schoolboy- crush sexy Jane Bond type who never crosses over into trashiness. ""Thunderbirds"" is not without its faults. Anthony Edwards is particularly grating playing the comic relief regressing to his ""Revenge of the Nerds"" persona as Brain a nerdy gadgets expert with a stutter. Tracys other four boys each with a unique personality in the TV series are almost impossible to tell apart in the movie. And the vision of the future seems incomplete; other than a monorail in England and everyone wearing way too much mousse in their hair there is almost no visible difference between 2065 and the present. Fans of the 1960s ""Thunderbirds"" will no doubt have other gripes as well. Paxton looks nothing like his TV counterpart (Michael Dukakis would have been a more literal choice) and much of the technical jargon that played well during the dawn of manned space travel has been wisely removed. Whats left are a few catchphrases (""Thunderbirds are go"") and a nicely captured spirit from a time when sexual innuendos bathroom humor and heavy weapons werent required to keep kids interested in a movie. -- Advisory This film contains mild violence.

"Saturday-morning fun revisited in Thunderbirds - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Saturday-morning fun revisited in Thunderbirds By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  July 30 2004 If you happened to be the right age in the mid-1960s -- lets say 7 -- and happened to be awake at the right time on Saturday mornings you might have stumbled across a couple of bizarre British kiddie shows set in the retro-gizmo future and peopled entirely by marionettes.Shot in ""Supermarionation"" ""Fireball XL-5"" and ""Thunderbirds"" featured heroes who looked like sentient bobbleheads and rocket ships that were no less cool for being clearly only 14 inches long. My sisters and I watched the shows in perplexed fascination if only to better imitate the characters jerky movements as we followed our parents around the house.Forty years after the fact and for no good reason whatsoever someone has seen fit to make a live-action version of ""Thunderbirds."" The script is puerile. The sets are almost as ticky-tacky as on the TV show. The acting for the most part is as wooden as you can get without actually being a marionette. Not only did the 7-year-old boy inside me have a high old time so did the 7-year-old daughter sitting next to me.Maybe its not a defensible critical position but the reason ""Thunderbirds"" works as well as it does is because it doesnt much care that its as square as a potholder. (Also cool rocket-cars. This is important.) Hewing closely to the original TV series the film gives us a Bill Paxton shorn of all discernible personality as Jeff Tracy a millionaire ex-astronaut who lives with his five or six sons (I lost count) on a secret high-tech island from which they venture forth in supersonic vehicles to rescue people in distress. ""Saving lives is a dangerous business but its what we do"" says Jeff and Paxton bless him never once winks to let us know hes above a line like that.Jeffs youngest son Alan (Brady Corbet) is an impetuous teen back from school with his dorky best friend Fermatt (Soren Fulton) son of Tracy Sr.s dorky mechanical whiz Brain (Anthony Edwards). There are apparently only two types of men in the world of ""Thunderbirds"" and youd better pray you dont belong to the one that wears glasses.The Tracys maintain five ""Thunderbirds"" of different shapes and purposes T1 is a silver rocket ship T2 a frog-green flying saucer T5 an orbiting space station and so forth. Im not going to speculate what the insurance runs to but it would surely be higher if Alan were allowed to drive. Hes not and it has him in a snit.In the midst of all this like the Mona Lisa at a yard sale is Sir Ben Kingsley. He plays The Hood a fiendish criminal mastermind given to eyeliner and red kimonos who somehow gets all the manly Tracy men stranded on the space station while he sets about using the Thunderbirds to rob the worlds banks. Presumably to buy more eyeliner. Id like to say that Kingsley stoops to the occasion and has fun but he seems paralyzed by the characters resemblance to Mike Myers as Dr. Evil and merely uses his unblinking gaze to control the minds of others. Which is lets face it what the actors been doing since ""Gandhi.""Up against The Hood and his minions are the kids Alan Fermatt and Tintin (Vanessa Anne Hudgens) -- no not the little Belgian lad but the know-it-all daughter of the Tracys domestic staff. Surprisingly its the girls who have the most fun in ""Thunderbirds."" Tintin is far more capable than either of her friends and the film picks up whenever Sophia Myles is onscreen as Lady Penelope the titled and teddibly droll fashion plate who functions as an adjunct Tracy (her hot-pink amphibious car serves as an unofficial T6).On the series Lady P. looked as much like Julie Christie as a puppet could without getting slapped with a lawsuit. Myles honors that spirit with a Carnaby Street unflappability and mad kickboxing skills that keep ""Thunderbirds"" cruising even when Saturday matinee cliches swamp the last 20 minutes. When all is said and done the movies a steaming plate of corn -- and indeed thats part of the pleasure. Myles though delivers a fine comic performance with no strings attached.

It was about a family called the Tracys who lived on a remote fortress island in the Pacific that hid launching stations for five super jet-fired vessels. The family was the International Rescue team and the supercrafts were outfitted for various types of emergencies in different terrains from outer space to underwater. Headed by family leader Jeff Tracy the team consisted of Tracy sons Scott John Virgil Gordon and Alan. Also in the puppet cast was the fabulous Lady Penelope an aristocratic ally of the Tracys who was driven around in her Jaguar by her trusty driver Parker who replied to every question with a ""Yes mlady."" Audiences soon learned the shows buzz phrases. ""F.A.B."" was the Tracys way of saying ""I read you."" And old man Jeff always said at least once a show ""Thunderbirds are go"" The filmmakers of this American version (which features American actors in the British roles) could have redone this show with cool computer-generated animation and a perfectly well-known collection of British actors to voice the parts. Of course a cool script would have been needed too. Instead this movie uses a cringe-worthy story about a new younger Tracy who goes to school in the United States and dreams of joining his cool brothers on their F.A.B. missions. He gets his wish when the Hood (Ben Kingsley) decides to take over the island. But enough This movie is horrible to sit through let alone talk about. Let this be an opportunity however for you to check out the original ""Thunderbirds"" (www.Thunderbirdsonline.com) on the Internet and rent some of those original shows now on DVD.

Consisting of five rocket-ship-flying young men and their widowed billionaire ex-astronaut father Jeff (a clench-jawed Bill Paxton) the films ""International Rescue"" team lets loose ""F-A-B""s like crazy over the course of the film and without fail its upbeat cheesy wholesomeness is always good for a smile. Long may ""F-A-B"" live on even as this mild update slips into the movie-history remainder bin. In a transparent attempt at attracting the youth vote (or at least all the tykes who saw the ""Spy Kids"" films) the movie strands Paxton and his four oldest on a spaceship and leaves it to a high-fiving trio of uninteresting kids including Brady Corbet as Paxtons youngest son to prove their mettle as Thunderbirds. This involves fighting a red-eyed kimono-wearing devil named the Hood played by Ben Kingsley who channels ""Flash Gordon""s Ming the Merciless and ""Temple of Doom""s Mola Ram but not a PG-rated smidgen of his former F-A-B self as the baddie in ""Sexy Beast.""

Cult status of the original series could spark curiosity in the U.K. but lack of U.S. brand recognition poses a serious challenge for the 70 million Working Title production. Universals somewhat schizophrenic summer kidpic ""Thunderbirds"" never fully decides between its parallel missions as a knowingly campy live-action update of the 1960s Brit TV puppet series and a fantasy action-adventure for the uninitiated that taps into the ""Spy Kids"" spirit of preteen empowerment. While not unenjoyable on either count the story rarely gets fired up to ""maximum thrust"" to use the rocket-speed parlance of its heroes. Cult status of the original series could spark curiosity in the U.K. but lack of U.S. brand recognition poses a serious challenge for the 70 million Working Title production. Conceived by husband-and-wife team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson the original ""Thunderbirds"" series was produced 1964-66. While its failure to secure a U.S. network sale caused the show to be canceled after 32 episodes the ""Supermarionation"" series still endures in reruns and on DVD for funky sci-fi geeks and pop culture nostalgists. The show also spawned two features from United Artists ""Thunderbirds Are Go"" in 1966 and ""Thunderbird 6"" two years later neither of which were profitable. Set in 2065 the series chronicled the dangerous deeds of widowed millionaire ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy and his five sons named after the first Americans in space. The family operates Intl. Rescue from their luxurious home base on an unmapped secret island in the South Pacific. Monitoring the globe from a manned space station the Tracys spring to action whenever natural or criminally orchestrated disasters threaten the planet zooming to the scene in Thunderbird rocket ships. Scripted by William Osborne and Michael McCullers from a story by Peter Hewitt and Osborne the main titles carry no credit acknowledging the characters created by the Andersons. However the update not only is remarkably faithful in resurrecting the full complement of original characters it also apes the shows clunky retro-futuristic technology 60s space depiction and the kind of generic plotting generally more suited to a TV half-hour -- heroism and altruism triumphs after a close call or two over greed and evil. While the Tracy sons on TV seemed well into early adulthood principal departure here is the youth element. Alan (Brady Corbet) is now a young teen impatient to become a card-carrying Thunderbird but stuck attending boarding school with Fermat (Soren Fulton) the bespectacled son of stuttering inventor Brains (Anthony Edwards) who keeps the Tracys in cool gadgetry and hot vehicles. The boys spring-break return to Tracy Island coincides with a plot by arch criminal the Hood (Ben Kingsley) to rob the worlds largest banks and throw the global monetary system into chaos. The scripters take the adult do-gooders out of the equation by sending father Jeff (Bill Paxton) and sons to the space station to rescue brother John (Lex Shrapnel) after a Hood missile strike. The criminal and his goons gain control of the Tracy base and cripple the rescue ship unaware that Alan and Fermat are hiding on the island. Determined to outwit the intruders the boys team with TinTin (Vanessa Anne Hudgens) the daughter of the Tracys loyal manservant -- and the Hoods half-brother -- Kyrano (Bhasker Patel). TinTins sudden blossoming sparks some flirtation with Alan. Aided by the arrival of cool-headed society beauty-turned-crime fighter Lady Penelope (Sophia Myles) and her doting chauffeur Parker (Ron Cook) the resourceful band board a Thunderbird and follow the Hood to Britain where he plans to hit the Bank of London. Director Jonathan Frakes who reinvigorated the ""Star Trek"" franchise with ""First Contact"" fails to pump the same energy into this tube-to-screen transfer. ""Thunderbirds"" purists may be outraged at the juvenile turn taken by the feature. But the film displays more verve and freshness when its winking at aficionados than in the rather rote action sequences which mostly lack the excitement to fully engage the target preteen crowd. Segs like Lady Penelopes acrobatic fight scene with the Hoods flunkeys are given especially sloppy coverage. Much of the series fascination came from the stiffness jerky movements and visible strings of its marionettes; far more fun could have been milked had this aspect been partly incorporated or played up by the cast. Exception is Paxton who gets with the program in a tongue-in-cheek woodenly earnest turn spouting lines like ""Saving lives is a dangerous business but its what we do."" Both Myles and Cook deliver steady laughs amusingly incarnating by far the campiest characters of the series -- pink couture-clad Lady P with her breathy posh tones and Parker with his convivial air of a reformed working-class thug. However given the films ample evidence of Ford sponsorship Lady P no longer summons her driver with ""Parker bring round the Rolls."" On the tech side John Beards production design drolly rekindles the shows look with its garish sets cheesy radar screens and lurid candy-colored flight vessels among them Lady Ps pink convertible with air and sea capabilities. The island hideout -- filmed in the Seychelles -- is a riot of 60s modern architecture and decor and the series staple of a monorail in peril is featured on the Thames. Hans Zimmers score neatly incorporates the original ""Thunderbirds Are Go"" theme and the delightful animated title sequence provides a witty recap of the Intl. Rescue setup.
