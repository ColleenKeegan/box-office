By David Denby Johnny Depp plays an A.I. expert in a movie directed by Wally Pfister.   Credit Illustration by Sachin Teng Almost fifty years ago Norman Mailer insisted that realistic fiction ""had never caught up with the rate of change in American life indeed it had fallen further and further behind."" Even then the answer to Mailers complaint was obvious. Many writers and movie directors have turned to science fiction--loving it for its brazenly free invention and its market popularity but also perhaps as a way of catching up. By setting events in the future they can identify social trends and technologies that bedazzle or frighten us push them to their limits and use the created fiction as a way of redirecting attention back to the present. Last summers ""Elysium"" posited an impending social system in which the elite gather in a blissful space station while the rest of the population lives on a squalid and exhausted Earth which is one way of talking about inequality. Similarly the young-adult dystopian fiction of ""The Hunger Games"" told kids something scary about an economic system that sets them against one another. ""Transcendence"" the first film directed by the great cinematographer Wally Pfister (he has worked on six Christopher Nolan movies) has a potentially suggestive premise. In the near future Will Caster (Johnny Depp) a research genius in artificial intelligence gets shot by some mangy neo-Luddites. (Their motto is ""Evolution without technology."") As Will drifts toward death he uploads himself--his brains tastes sensibilities--into a supercomputer that he had earlier crammed with Wiki-like information about everything. His adoring wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) wants to hold on to him and shes enthralled when he shows up thinking and talking on computer screens--hes physically dead but immortal in bytes. She cant have tender sex with him as Joaquin Phoenixs lonely guy did with his operating system in ""Her"" but they can snuggle intellectually in cyberspace. Theres just one problem Wills brain having achieved ""transcendence"" suddenly seeks power takes over the Internet and begins to control the world. This leaves his former colleagues (Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman) rather alarmed. Evelyn hoping to soften Wills imperial urge or possibly to stop him cold tries to join him. ""Upload me"" becomes her plea. I wish that the movie were better because theres a vivid fear lodged in it that we could lose control to an artificial intelligence outfitted with human qualities an electronic overlord that masters the grid. Pfister working with the cinematographer Jess Hall produces some stunning scenes--magnificent all-black or all-glass underground laboratories and a vast field of white solar panels that look like palms upraised in supplication. But Pfisters dramatic inexperience shows Wills former colleagues form an alliance with the neo-Luddites while Will who has created strings of life-enhancing particles that bring dead tissue back to life resurrects followers. When they all go to war Pfister stages some very cheesy and even amateurish fighting. The movie is rhythmless and shapeless Pfister throws in multiple climaxes and reversals and too many scenes of characters staring at computers in astonishment. Even worse ""Transcendence"" is tame. It lacks the emblematic visual motifs that bring science fiction close to the uncanny even to a kind of cultic religion. Depp with his elegant trimmed beard and his mellifluous equipoise is just a suave ghost in the machine. Hes stuck in his rectangular frame and he doesnt frighten or move us. Poor Rebecca Hall with her vibrant emotionalism has to throw herself against a mass of sleepy pixels. Im surprised that Pfister and the screenwriter Jack Paglen didnt flip the films point of view and show us what Will the higher intelligence ""sees"" from within his electronic Valhalla. Like the God of Genesis this new deity must have a low opinion of second-rate flesh and blood. And Pfister and Paglen never make up their minds whether the joining of human and artificial intelligence is a good thing. Will may be bent on conquest but he also wants to make everyone immortal. Are complete benevolence and complete power tantamount to the same thing? Thats an unsettling idea that the filmmakers fail to pursue. ""Transcendence"" is a muddle; it takes more creative energy than this to catch up to the present. Like Pfister Jeremy Saulnier is also primarily a cinematographer (he has worked with the indie director Matthew Porterfield) and the first thing to say about ""Blue Ruin"" the eccentric low-budget thriller which he photographed wrote and directed is that he has a feeling for the emotional quality of light. At the start he introduces us to an unlikely and possibly unlikable hero a wanderer with matted hair and beard named Dwight (Macon Blair) who lives somewhere on the Delaware shore in his car an ancient Pontiac Bonneville--the blue ruin of the title. Saulniers rendering of the sky and the ocean are so sensuous and tactile that as Dwight settles down for the night we are soothed into intimacy with him. He provides for himself by fishing scavenging and stealing and breaks into houses when he needs to wash. (When the owners of one place come home he jumps out the bathroom window towel clutched at his waist.) He is not pitiable but silently resourceful. What made him a vagrant? As we find out both of his parents were murdered years ago leaving Dwight and his older sister alone. He split from her and has been unravelling ever since. But the killer gets out of prison and Dwight tries to pull himself together in order to exact revenge. No one could be less suited for the job. Saulnier now based in Brooklyn was born in 1977 in Alexandria Virginia and he shot parts of the movie there with help from his family; his star Macon Blair has been a collaborator for years. (In 2007 they made the micro-budget horror movie ""Murder Party."") ""Blue Ruin"" which won an international-critics prize at Cannes last year is Saulniers successful attempt to build some creative space between the iron conventions of Hollywood revenge sagas and the informality of a movie made with friends. With its obsessed but unqualified hero ""Blue Ruin"" makes a kind of comic sense if you match it up against glum big-budget male revenge fantasies--hard-driving movies with Charles Bronson and Mel Gibson say or the recent ""Out of the Furnace."" In that film an ex-con played by Christian Bale emerges from a bleak bitter post-industrial landscape to avenge his slain brother. But hes violent were meant to believe because of miserable social conditions. The director Scott Cooper wrapped mayhem in self-importance; Saulnier wraps it in bizarre anecdote and mishap. The Coen brothers began the same way with ""Blood Simple."" ""Blue Ruin"" is shockingly bloody but most of what happens can only be taken as idiosyncratic. Dwight goes after his parents murderer with a knife and kills him in one of the most slovenly assaults in movie history--the sequence is balanced between horror and grotesque comedy. As Dwight drives away he realizes that he has taken on not a single man but a clan--the Clelands--and that he has put his sister and her children in jeopardy. These are not the kinds of families who call the police; weve fallen below the law into a feuding way of life in which people keep guns at hand and settle things on their own. Dwight needs a disguise. After bathing and shaving in one of the borrowed houses he puts on a blue dress shirt and tan slacks. He looks like a corporate guy who has just strolled away from his cubicle and Blair plays him with a soft voice and yearning eyes. When violence isnt stylized in ways that make it meaninglessly easy to enjoy we have to respond to it (if the director has skill) moment by moment--in this case surprise by surprise some of them funny some appalling. From the beginning Saulnier seeks our complicity with his bumbling hero and he holds it by putting Dwight through absurd adventures without undermining him. One of the Clelands comes after him with a crossbow and he has to wrestle with an arrow stuck in his thigh. His difficulties become an excruciatingly funny comment on those action-movie heroes who extract bullets from their own bodies (Stallone had a thing about this) clean their wounds (a splash of whiskey does the job) and get on with it. Saulnier may spill a lot of blood but hes a responsible craftsman. He films everything from Dwights point of view and the action however fast-moving is detailed and convincing. The direction and the editing by Julia Bloch are better than any Ive seen in a low-budget film in recent years. Its only at the end of ""Blue Ruin"" that my pleasure drained away. Saulnier introduces an element of moral complexity that might have been admirable in another film but overwhelms the modest semi-parodistic realist style of this movie. He winds up trapping himself in a lunge toward gothic tragedy he resorts to hyper-violence succumbing to what hes been teasing. Saulnier has a talent for subjectively rendered mood for the common life of Americans. Im eager to see him start fresh and enter the world without guard rails.

"Transcendence - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Transcendence Posted by Christy Lemire on April 21 2014 12 Comments Warner Bros. Pictures Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action and violence some bloody images brief strong language and sensuality. Running time 119 minutes. Two stars out of four. Wally Pfister has made his name as one of the top cinematographers in the industry having worked consistently with Christopher Nolan and winning an Academy Award for Nolans mind-bending masterpiece ""Inception."" Now Pfister is calling the shots himself making his directing debut with ""Transcendence"" -- and he seems to be aiming for the same kind of philosophical questions and existential dilemmas that ""Inception"" posed. Pfister certainly brings his eye for striking visual compositions and dazzling special effects to this sci-fi thriller. Several individual images are really quite lovely. But his artistic talents are in the service of a story that begins life with some thinky (if hackneyed) notions about the dangers of being too reliant on technology before turning numbingly boring and eventually just plain silly. Its an ambitious misfire. Johnny Depp is oddly monotone and detached as Dr. Will Caster a brilliant scientist whos been experimenting with artificial intelligence alongside his equally brilliant wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) with whom he shares a charmingly boho-chic craftsman in Berkeley Calif. When a high-tech terrorist group (led by a barely-there Kate Mara) shoots him at a conference with a radioactive bullet he only has a few weeks to live. So he uploads his consciousness to the Internet to preserve his legacy. As one does. Surely nothing will go wrong right? In no time Will is everywhere seizing access to millions of dollars controlling machines and minds and -- with Evelyns help -- establishing an elaborate underground solar-powered bunker in a middle-of-nowhere desert town ostensibly in the name of furthering technology. The plot holes are more like chasms requiring great leaps of faith. The couples longtime friends and colleagues (Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman part of an esteemed supporting cast) are after them as is the obligatory FBI agent (Cillian Murphy) leading the investigation into whos targeting Will and where he is now. Wills omniscient omnipresent quest for power should be frightening. The multitiered hunt to shut him down should be thrilling. The conflicted position Evelyn finds herself in should be heartbreaking. (And Halls performance truly is the best part here because at least she infuses the story with some recognizable humanity). Instead ""Transcendence"" is none of the above. Working from a script by Jack Paglen Pfister has made a film thats actually quite talky stodgy dull and overlong. ""Transcendence"" also represents a misguided use of Depps talents. Hes such a physically creative and fearless actor that it seems like a strange choice to trap him in avatar form inside flat-screen monitors for the majority of the films two-hour running time. This Max Headroom version of Depps character never registers as a force to fear despite his growing appetite for control. Hes sedate annoyingly needy passive-aggressive and -- ultimately -- a source of unintentional laughs pathetically popping up all over the place begging his wife to talk to him. Depp hasnt exactly had a great few years between ""The Tourist"" ""The Rum Diary"" ""Dark Shadows"" and ""Lone Ranger"" (although the animated ""Rango"" was gorgeous and a great use of his off-kilter charm). But you can see why he would be drawn to the pedigreed team involved with ""Transcendence"" as well as to its themes which couldnt be more relevant. Still the perils-of-technology parable has been told more grippingly countless times since the proliferation of personal computers began. Hell ""War Games"" is scarier than this. As for the man-vs.-machine interface at work ""Her"" made that connection more believable more moving and that has everything to do with Spike Jonzes script. ""Her"" always treated Scarlett Johanssons character the operating system Samantha like a real and complex person which made her romance with the lonely Joaquin Phoenix totally relatable despite its innate absurdity. But as in ""Her"" ""Transcendence"" also features a human surrogate for Wills physical longings courtesy of Clifton Collins Jr. When he puts the moves on Evelyn the moment should be poignant but instead provokes squirms and giggles. When its all over you will turn on your iPhone and ask Siri to find you a good restaurant for a bite to eat near the theater. And you will have learned nothing.

Even though Depp has had a string of bad movies he is happy. Reply April 21 2014  by  Dan O.     Great review Christy. Felt like it had so much to say but somehow didnt say anything at all. Never really seemed all that confident with itself in the first place anyway. Reply April 23 2014  by  Katie Hinton     I think all of you are crazy. This movie was very unique and great to watch. Sure it did have its long duration parts but it all made sense in the end. I think Depp played a terrific part in this movie and really captured the personality of his character. No. Just no. This movie is great. Reply April 24 2014  by  Ivan     What a moronic review. Who said the machine was supposed to be scary? You didt understand the movie. The machine was ""the good guy"" Reply May 21 2014  by  Andrew Emmons     Thank you.. I was beginning to think I was crazy How did none of the critics get that the point of the movie was that the thing that humans were so scared of did zero damage to anything or anybody the entire movie while the humans caused many deaths - thousands if you think about the implications of the entire world going off the grid long-term (hospital patients the elderly newborns etc). Reply August 16 2014  by  Shaun Matrix     I Agree the machine was good the review was bad. Just like a lot of characters in the movie Christy made premature judgements half way through assuming the worst of the nicest most helpful heart warming A.I system ever invented before it had a chance of spreading love and happiness through out the world Christy Do you not realise that you proven the premise of the movie to be true.. Reply April 26 2014  by  Mat X     Yes indeed those are surely long duration walks over white underground corridors at the facility or the fields of solar power units. What is great the upload technology; or its destruction under pretense of ""earthy"" ecology from protagonists wife early dreams? There is no real people with real mission; there are people doing stuff without purpose detached from real world. Something of uncertain value gets created then destroyed so what? Reply May 13 2014  by  Mike     You really did completely miss the point of the movie. Its actually pretty funny to read your review in that light. Reply June 8 2014  by  Sin     I dont like to base my opinions of movies on box offices sales and popularity so despite being aware that this one was not doing so well i was really excited to see it. It was a little heartbreaking to be honest. I adore Johnny. But there are so many aspects of his performance in this one (the Jack Sparrowesque quirks in his first scene the glasses rhe suit that he wears at the end) that are so specific to him as an actor that they detract from what could have been an okay performance. There are certain themes that were hinted at in the film that I could sort of think about getting behind. But I would have to agree with most aspects of this review. Reply July 2 2014  by  Stephaniie     Different from Her this intelligent operative system had no rules. Depp A.I could do anything. Shut down all computers in the world? No problem. Launch missiles and nuclear bombs? No problem. But this A.I. was even more evil minded he actually wanted to control every human/animal/living being on Earth. Why shouldnt we develop self-aware A.I.? This is the main reason why not. The issue I had with Transcendence is how little we know how and where dr. Caster aquire his knowledge? The solution we get is.. i can go anywhere . Sure it was cool watching what nanotechnology can achieve and very unsettling seeing how people let themselves be drones just to cure their decease. I rather pay anything to be able to see if I was blind but I never would let someone install a chip that anytime during the day give some A.I. total control over my body and thoughts. Thats even worse then Terminator. Despite the DA-DA-DA-DA superhuman powers displayed I love too see more into the A.I. point-of-view . How it traveled around the Internet. What it really became? How it used it powers outside the U.S. desert city? Reply August 4 2014  by  D. Neal     The last paragraph of this review in and out of context is useless. Reply September 13 2014  by  Selk     I think the reviewer missed the whole point of the movie by 5 light-years or so. Transcendence is about power in the sense of someone being able to change the reality that surrounds him/her in this case Dr. Casters. The question that you have to ask yourself is what would happen if somehow you could go beyond your limitations as a human being? The ""machine"" is merely a container for Dr. Casters mind. How did his wife uploaded his consciousness to the IA or how did he developed highly advanced nanobots is not the main theme the choices that Dr. Caster and the people around him made is the thing that matters. It doesnt take a NASA technician to understand that Dr. Casters objective from the moment he became uploaded is to ensure his continuing existence finding a way to ""come back"" to a human form and being there for his wife. A very good movie about science morals and relationships. 8/10 Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Whats going on? Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Artificial Intelligence Christopher Nolan Computers Editors Picks Internet Johnny Depp Movies rebecca hall Science Fiction and Fantasy Social Media Transcendence Wally Pfister Technology News Entertainment News Johnny Depp in ""Transcendence"" (Credit Alcon Entertainment/Peter Mountain) In Spike Jonzes ""Her"" Scarlett Johansson plays an operating system who becomes a human beings lover and then transcends him moving into some numinous and ethereal computing cloud like the distant deity of liberal Protestant theology. Software engineers and artificial-intelligence theorists groused about Jonzes portrayal of the social and technological future which was perhaps more fanciful than rigorous. But compared to Oscar-winning cinematographer Wally Pfisters directing debut ""Transcendence"" in which Johnny Depp plays a left-utopian scientist who gets uploaded into a supercomputer ""Her"" is a work of brilliant futurist prophecy larded with gems of philosophical complexity. ""Transcendence"" should really be called ""Him"" with a capital H Born again in digital space and connected to the Internet Depps character becomes an avaricious power-hungry and petulant God the unbearable finger-in-every-pie overlord of the Old Testament.Theres an Occams Razor approach to the question of why ""Transcendence"" is such a terrible movie one that doesnt even require engaging the larger question of why Hollywood movies never seem to get technology right let alone capture its moral or philosophical consequences. (My wife has refused to watch Sandra Bullock in anything ever since the risible 1995 thriller ""The Net"" conspicuously made by people who were not quite sure what that term indicated.) I can save you the trouble of writing in if you were going to say that its ""just a movie"" and that perhaps I need to chillax and unbundle my knickers etc. Thats not actually an answer to either question; indeed one might say that the ritual invocation of ""entertainment"" as an antiseptic force of pleasure-seeking scrubbing bubbles that neuter all thought and meaning raises rather more questions than it answers. (Pfister ""First and foremost I want to entertain the viewer."")Anyway this picture has some specific characteristics although theyre elusive and not plentiful amid the general atmosphere of third-rate apocalyptic rehash. ""Transcendence"" is a moronic stew of competing impulses -- bad science meets bad sociology meets bad theology -- in which its hard to say who looks worse The naive techno-boosters like Depps Dr. Will Caster (an Ayn Rand character name if ever there was one) wearing round spectacles and spouting cliches about the coming man-machine ""singularity"" apparently mined from Wired magazine in 1999 or the small-minded Luddite reactionaries of the so-called underground resistance conducting KGB-style assassination campaigns against their enemies. In his recent interview with the Wrap (also quoted above) Pfister said that he wanted audiences to ""connect with both sides of the debate"" but made his own position clear if you even want to call it a position ""If the characters can use technology for the betterment of society why not wipe out pollution? Why not heal people with diseases?""Im sorry but ""Lets use machines to cure cancer as long as theres no downside"" is barely even a thought or a wish and its certainly not a philosophy. Do Pfister and screenwriter Jack Paglen actually believe that theres some constituency of DIY cord-cutter radical-skeptic types with funny hair who are dead set against medical technology? Im pretty sure the answer is no which brings us back to the parsimonious explanation for ""Transcendence"" Pfister who has finally gotten a turn in the directors chair after many years as Christopher Nolans cinematographer is one of those movie-industry people who is really good at the technical side of the job but maybe not you know all that much of a candidate for the chair in Heidegger studies or whatever. Pfisters former boss on the other hand is a dark genius when it comes to infusing his sensory-overload cinema with complicated subtext with at least a somewhat convincing simulation of depth and ambiguity. (Nolan would never have touched this screenplay with a 50-foot robotic arm.)Actually no wait. That sounds like Im accusing Pfister of being a dumbass which is totally not the point. You dont have to be a book-learnin intellectual with an expensive education to be an important filmmaker far from it. As Mark Harris terrific new book about Hollywood and World War II ""Five Came Back"" makes clear Frank Capra was kind of an idiot with confused proto-Tea Party politics and John Ford was a taciturn Irish-American drunk a classic mans-man who probably never once had a conversation about ""ideas."" But Capra and Ford engaged with the ideas about democracy and manhood and America in their films with profound sincerity in original and often intense fashion. Harris account further demonstrates that the perceived ideological content of Hollywood movies was a matter of intense interest to studio executives who scrutinized screenplays and finished films closely for any hint of anti-Americanism left-wing sympathy or other troublesome messaging.Wally Pfister is smart enough to understand perhaps not quite consciously that times have changed and the ideological task is now different. (Spoiler alert this paragraph) ""Transcendence"" is constructed to signal an engagement with supposedly important issues but under the surface it delivers a familiar narrative of gender norms - the abusive controlling husband and the hysterical doormat wife - mixed with a message of militant conformism If only those crazy radicals hadnt shot Will Caster with a radioactive bullet his magic sentient computer would have scrubbed all the bad chemicals from the air and water cloned the passenger pigeon and restored sight to the blind. Since its evidently a very short step from turning off your smartphone to protesting against animal experimentation to psychotic acts of violence youre better off sticking with your defined role of spectatorship and consumption and paying no attention to the men behind the curtain. You Might Also Like So the question of how and why this particular movie delivers such a poorly informed and morally dishonest parable about technology inescapably evolves into the bigger one Why does mainstream cinema seem so baffled and awkward when confronted with the Information Age? Its been almost 20 years since ""The Net"" (directed by Hollywood lifer Irwin Winkler then in his mid-60s) two decades in which the lives of ordinary people have become inextricably intertwined with social media and the Internet and the depiction of those things on film still feels mystified. The recent James Bond film ""Skyfall"" was visually spectacular and dramatically effective (as that formula goes) but its depiction of the Internet was standard-issue paranoia thematically indistinguishable from that found in the circa-2000 wave of silly hacker movies like ""Swordfish"" ""Antitrust"" and ""Enemy of the State"" Its a magical device or plot shortcut used by bad guys to penetrate the free worlds intelligence agencies and blow stuff up.It may be worth noting that those dumb hacker flicks often got one aspect of techno-paranoia right which a huge hit like ""Skyfall"" and a would-be hit like ""Transcendence"" conveniently ignore or turn upside down In the real world we have more to fear from government spies and spooks than from whackadoodle supervillains on fortified islands or Ukrainians phishing for credit-card numbers. We dont need to upload Johnny Depp onto the Internet to feel like someone is watching us as it turns out. But its a whole lot less flattering to be watched by a faceless bureaucratic panopticon an impersonal bot-God than by a jealous husband who monitors our dreams manipulates the stock market and reanimates the dead. Benedict Cumberbatch the most adored figure in pop culture made a movie about hacker-counterculture hero Julian Assange and absolutely nobody wanted to watch it (for good reason). David Finchers ""The Social Network"" while it was an important American film is barely about technology at all and neither is Finchers ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" although it may offer the most nuanced and realistic portrayal of hacker culture in any recent Hollywood picture (which is not saying a lot). Theres a formal conflict at work here in that the medium of cinema has difficulty addressing a technological revolution that threatens to devour subsume and transcend it or may already have done so.Describing the recent invention of television in 1944 German refugee philosophers Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno noted that the film industry might abruptly find itself transformed from the vanguard of cultural production into a reactionary or conservative force. ""If technology had its way"" they wrote ""the film would be delivered to peoples homes as happens with the radio."" Warner Bros. they quipped might become as old-fashioned as a symphony orchestra while TV would become the derisive fulfillment of Richard Wagners dream of Gesamtkunstwerk the fusion of all the arts in one form. Im tempted to suggest that the Internet takes that a huge conceptual step further by convincing us that our act of consumption is also simultaneously an act of creation. (Im sorry and not sorry those guys did not live long enough to theorize the Internet; its safe to say they wouldnt have been overly impressed with its supposed democracy.)So movies about information technology often seem embarrassing because they cannot capture or convincingly fake the ever-changing ""interactive"" flow of the thing itself the very spirit or Geist as the Frankfurt boys would have said that makes us feel like participants in the online universe rather than consumers. They remind us that we are sitting in front of a manufactured narrative that may have its own agenda as the Internet appears not to do. The Hollywood films agenda of ideological reassurance and thought-free entertainment its insistence on a mode of pleasure that ""must not demand any effort and therefore moves rigorously in the worn grooves of association"" (Horkheimer and Adorno again) then becomes thunderingly obvious and we thrust it away. Are there exceptions? Yeah sure but not when you make terrible casting decisions Nobody thinks Johnny Depp would make a good God. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

All Rights Reserved Sometimes its helpful to know certain details about how a film has come together. And sometimes its just so much information. Transcendence the directorial debut of Christopher Nolans go-to cinematographer Wally Pfister was shot on film rather than digitally as most big Hollywood movies (and nearly all small ones) are today. Is that going to make you like it better than you might otherwise? That depends on your tolerance for quasi-cerebral cautionary tales about our dependence on digital whatsits and mans supposed tendency to want to play God -- with lots of special effects thrown in. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - To be fair to Pfister and other directors who prefer the textural depth and the delicately calibrated shadings of light that old-school technology affords -- a loyal band including J.J. Abrams Steven Spielberg and Paul Thomas Anderson -- shooting on film can make a difference. Except when it doesnt. Transcendence looks very nice; it certainly doesnt look cheap. But even though Pfister and cinematographer Jess Hall lavish a great deal of visual care on the movies key actress -- the gifted and extraordinarily likable Rebecca Hall -- her character has little to do but dutifully moon over her sort-of dead husband and colleague an artificial-intelligence expert whose brain has been uploaded into a computer just before his death and who from his hologram limbo now wants to rule the world.Its probably supposed to make a difference that this digitized despot is played by Johnny Depp looking characteristically soulful but also as usual vaguely whiskery and unbathed -- hes the cool-dad version of a megalomaniac. At the beginning his character Will Caster comes off as ambitious but mostly well-intentioned and hes devoted to his wicked-smart wife Halls Evelyn. The two hope to create a machine that will combine the collective intelligence of every human being in the history of the world and then turn it up to 11. Plus it will have emotions.Film Details Transcendence RatingPG-13 GenreSciFi/Fantasy Running Time120 More Info Trailer You can see early on what a disaster thats going to be. Actually you know from the very first scene in which a scruffy-looking Paul Bettany wanders through a city devoid of electricity running water and worst of all Wi-Fi. (We get the gist of things when we see a shopkeeper using a busted laptop keyboard to prop a door open. Its such an effective image Pfister uses it twice.) Bettanys Max Waters used to be a friend and colleague of the Casters and he takes us on a flashback tour of happier times In the days before Hologram Will got a taste for power we see the couple chilling out in their garden in Berkeley as earnest faux-folky grooves waft from the cheerfully analog turntable theyve rigged up nearby apparently using that antique device known as an extension cord.But what does it all add up to? Youd think Pfisters love for genuine celluloid and his dedication to craftsmanship would make him a perfect fit for this ostensibly thought-provoking material. (He is a fine cinematographer though his perceptive work on movies like Laurel Canyon may be a better indicator of his gifts than the flashier pictures hes made with Nolan). But Transcendence written by Jack Paglen is just more business as usual one of those ""control technology or it will control you"" sermons that nonetheless enlists the usual heap of technically advanced special effects like healing tendrils of energy that seep up from the earth like phantom vines necessary to lure audiences into theaters these days. Pfister tries to build layers of complexity into the material -- is Depps character good bad or good-bad? -- but none of it takes and the movies phony love-beyond-the-grave ending doesnt click either partly because weve just watched Hologram Will behave like an egotistical jerk to Evelyn for two hours. Just die already OK?Still Hall never misses a beat. No matter how dumb the material gets her face always shows whats at stake. Shes one of those actors who puts the emphasis on listening rather than talking her eyes detecting and decoding untruths and deceptions almost before the script does. She deserves better material than this and a better screen partner. Depp is sometimes an astonishing actor and sometimes a check-cashing one. In Transcendence you can practically hear the ka-ching. The movie is frustrating for other reasons A number of welcome figures have been flown in from the planet of underused actors including Bettany Clifton Collins Jr. and Cillian Murphy but none have enough to do. And because you cant have a cautionary tale about the end of life as we know it without him Morgan Freeman shows up in a series of grandpa cardigans. His presence is necessary to underscore the seriousness of this very serous entertainment shot very seriously on film. It sure looks great. And it adds up to little.

"Nano Tech Transcendence and Small Thinking in Modern Sci-Fi << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Nano Tech Transcendence and Small Thinking in Modern Sci-Fi Movies April 18 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print In Transcendence Johnny Depp plays Will Caster a scientist on the verge of an artificial-intelligence breakthrough so world-altering that a faction of Luddite radicals demands that he stop it. After a presentation one of the radicals (Lukas Haas) shoots Will but doesnt kill him because were he to die wed be on our way home after 12 minutes. No no The bullet was laced with poison that leaves Will with only weeks to live which is long enough for his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) to propose uploading his consciousness into their ""physically independent neural network"" -- PINN. Its a practical plan like storing leftovers. So this new home for Will -- cables screens and servers -- basically amounts to very expensive Tupperware. He speaks to Evelyn from giant monitors loudspeakers and earpieces not about love and romantic existentialism but about location ""We need to get off the grid"" says Will. ""Where are you going?"" she asks. ""Everywhere"" says Will. Thats pretty typical dialogue. Transcendence is a lot more Him than Her. What this computerized Will wants is world domination. He and Evelyn buy a small town in the middle of nowhere build a lab that stretches for miles in the sort of immaculate space you find only in science-fiction thrillers and use nanotechnology to turn the townspeople including Clifton Collins Jr. into a race of indestructible drones and minions -- Will calls them hybrids -- that builds a farm of solar panels. The radicals -- led by a steely bottle-blonde Kate Mara and called RIFT (""Revolutionary Independence From Technology"") -- get wind of Wills transmogrification. They kidnap his friend and fellow scientist Max (Paul Bettany) and try to destroy PINN before Will connects to the Internet. Obviously theyre too late. Otherwise wed be on our way home after 40 minutes. No no The radicals need to team up with the FBI (its Agent Cillian Murphy) the military (Colonel Cole Hauser) plus one of Wills former colleagues (and Dr. Morgan Freeman). No one seems to know exactly what Will is up to but everyone agrees that he and Evelyn must be stopped. Theyre in such agreement that certitude crowds out any ominousness. Jack Paglen is the credited screenwriter and theres a serious important action-adventure at the core of this movie. What we get in the end though is skim-milk science fiction. Theres no attempt to complicate the widening philosophical divide between Evelyn and Max who wears a cross around his neck and is terrified by the implications of Evelyns proposal. Max is presented as the films moral conscience. First hes holed up with the Casters then jailed by RIFT. His sympathies shift but theres no drama in the change. A switch just gets flipped. The Casters speak about their techno-neurobiology as if theyre addressing a new Peace Corps class. (As an indication of the sensibility at work one of the opening images features a waterdrop parachuting from a sunflower in the slowest-ever motion.) The director of Transcendence is Wally Pfister a very good cinematographer whos shot most of Christopher Nolans films and is making his first film as a director. Nolans an executive producer here and you can tell what Pfisters going for whether he knows it or not that Nolan feeling. His film approximates the atmosphere of something like Inception but he doesnt have material as ornately lunatic. He doesnt even have an ending to work with. This should be a movie about marital obsession how a wife cant bear to go on without her husband. It should be a movie about moral-philosophical fanaticism how the radicals wont tolerate a world run by technology. Youre permitted to free-associate about what it means for a man to turn not into RoboCop but Siri. You can think about the perils of government surveillance and maybe experience paranoia about your relationship to your devices. But Transcendence doesnt induce paranoia wonder or suspense. Its the most incurious film you could make about something as simultaneously preposterous and promising as Johnny Depp the Internet. As is his occupational wont Pfister supplies handsome shots of bundled cables building facades and code dancing across the screen. He even throws in portentous images photographed through dewy windows which ought to be part of a chapter in The Beginners Guide to Cinematographer Turned Director. He doesnt yet have the skill to make a movie even a sheepishly written one come to life without a vision. Its helpful to remember that Nolans first movie was a sleepy little conceptual number called Following. Pfisters been permitted to commit creative stagnation at a grander scale. This is skim-milk Nolan too. Theres nothing nutty in Pfisters execution. Hes taking the look seriously. But I dont go to movies for a look. I go for feeling. The ideas should kick. The energy should pop. The actors should act. If the concepts craziness cant come through -- and just to be clear this concept is crazy -- shouldnt the casts? Will might surpass the limits of existence but the actors cant transcend the script. Hall captures the basic ethical and emotional nightmare of Evelyns situation. But the film is too busy to do much with it. Otherwise you cant tell Wills hybrids from everyone else Theyre all body-snatched. Theres a nominally climactic scene in which Freeman Bettany Mara Murphy Hauser and a few other people stand on a roof looking at each other and just trading exposition. Thats pretty much the entire movie. Depp for his part might actually be out of performances. Without a complete physical transformation and without Tim Burton he seems in contempt of acting. His face doesnt move. His rich bizarrely accented baritone operates without inflection here. Its not just a lack of joy. Theres no soul blood or pulse either. Even before Pirates of the Caribbean made him a true movie star he was an actor who seemed to enjoy acting. Since those films and aside from what hes done with Burton hes become increasingly remote. Hes become the corpse you feared Sean Penn would become after he admitted a disdain for his profession. Depp could have brought a creepy desperately needed madness to this movie. Instead he almost literally Skypes it in. Whatever frustration or bafflement one feels about Shane Carruths pair of microscopic magnum opuses -- Primer and Upstream Color -- they are fundamentally works of and about scientific obsession. You know youre in the presence of a compulsive a dreamer. I dont know how Carruth would fare at the helm of a Transcendence but certainly hed bring more to it than a weeping sunflower. Watching Transcendence I also thought a lot about the insurgent kick of David Cronenbergs farcical gaming thriller eXistenZ and wished that this movie had gone there. Or any even vaguely kinky place Cronenberg does. When Will proposes a physical surrogate for Evelyn she recoils in horror. But at that point if we cant have actual transcendence well settle for a little transgression.

Its also an apt description of the films script a cockamamie mishmash of Big Ideas and TED Conference buzzwords that sound smart but dont compute. Johnny Depp playing whats probably the closest thing to a villain hes managed in his 30-year career stars as Dr. Will Caster. Hes a maverick brainiac working on a top-secret sentient computer nicknamed ""PINN"" (Physically Independent Neural Network) a colossal wall of servers that resembles one of those hulking old IBM mainframes with menacingly blinking LED lights and the soothing monotone female voice that anyone whos seen 2001 will immediately suspect is up to no good. Depps Caster has an equally brilliant partner and wife named Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) as well as a rock-amp;-roll level of nerdy fame. All of which makes him a ripe target for a technophobic band of Earth First-style terrorists preaching sci-fi doom. After delivering a preposterous lecture at an ""Evolve the Future"" conference hes shot by one of the terrorists. The wound seems harmless enough until its discovered that the bullet was laced with polonium. Now hes got a radiation death sentence. With his expiration date quickly closing in his grieving wife decides against the misgivings of their more levelheaded colleagues (Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman) to upload his consciousness to PINN. She will do whatever she can to allow him and his work to live on. (This is where a Living Will would have been handy). With a series of electrodes sprouting out of his shaved head Depp looks like Pinhead (or PINNhead?) from the Hellraiser films crossed with a Radio Shack Chia Pet. And guess what? The experiment works. Depp has become the soul in the machine. But at what price? Directed by Wally Pfister Christopher Nolans brilliant cinematographer dating all the way back to 2000s Memento Transcendence at least looks as great as youd expect. But the script by first-time screenwriter Jack Paglen is so full of half-explained cyber-nonsense and wheezy kneejerk man-vs.-technology cliches it borders on the ludicrous. It doesnt help that Depp?the star who will no doubt be the chief reason most folks go to see the film?is reduced to a spectral talking head that appears on video monitors spouting technobabble like some sort of Max Headroom digital messiah. Even worse is just how many good actors are left with little or nothing to do. Hall and Bettany never get to do much more than look increasingly concerned at the disembodied Wills bizarre actions Freeman all-too-infrequently wanders onscreen to offer Voice-of-God concerns and poor Kate Mara as the leader of the luddite resistance is given the most thankless task of all popping up to spout manifesto-ready slogans. Transcendence wants to be a thinking persons film about what the Internet hath wrought a la The Matrix questioning our dependence on ones and zeroes instead of human reason. And the film imagines a cyber 9/11 apocalypse thats more numbing than chilling. Watching it all unfold and slowly go off the rails you cant help but wonder what Pfisters mentor Nolan might have done with the same material. My guess is he would have sent the script back for a Page One rewrite for starters.

By Peter Rainer Film critic April 18 2014 Save for later Saved This photo released by Warner Bros. shows Johnny Depp as Will Caster in Alcon Entertainments sci-fi thriller Transcendence a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Peter Mountain Alcon Entertainment-Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The new Johnny Depp sci-fi movie ""Transcendence"" may seem newfangled but its subject is that oldest of chestnuts Thou shalt not play God. The only spin here is that God is strictly speaking a supercomputer.Depp plays Dr. Will Caster the biggest cheese in the field of artificial intelligence who is close to creating a sentient machine that contains everything ever known to man combined with the complete range of human emotions. He seems like a rather mild-mannered sort not a world changer but his research provokes anti-technology extremists to stop him at all costs. As ""Transcendence"" demonstrates however you can kill the body but the mind properly downloaded can achieve immortality. It can even take over the world if youre not paying attention.What this all means in mundane terms is that Depp plays most of the movie as a species of hologram. Audiences expecting a flesh-and-blood walking-and-talking Johnny Depp will be flummoxed. And his performance at least when hes in his ""singularity"" phase is about as thin as a hologram too. Hes balanced out by the hyperactive Rebecca Hall as Wills adoring computer scientist wife Eveyln and Paul Bettany as his best friend and fellow researcher Max. In the future one hopes sentient supercomputers in the movies not to mention in real life will have a bit more oomph. Recommended Think youre a film buff? Take our movie trivia quiz Moderately entertaining periodically draggy ""Transcendence"" is not as wacky-visionary as ""The Matrix"" or nearly as lyrical as ""Her"" which was about a mans romantic infatuation with a computer. The dialogue is often in the flat-footed ""We need to call Washington"" mode. Wally Pfister a cinematographer (""Inception"" the ""Dark Knight"" movies) making his directorial debut from a script by Jack Paglen doesnt have the transcendent spark.

Unfortunately it doesnt seem to know it. Ostensibly a cautionary tale about the prospect of the Singularity - the idea that human consciousness and technology will one day inevitably merge to create a superior form of life -- Wally Pfisters film tries to blend action epic intimate drama and scientific thriller all into one. But its really a film like The Fly or Colossus of New York in which scientists flaunt the rules of nature and wind up turning themselves (or their loved ones) into horrific awesome beasts always with tragic results. Here the scientist in question is brilliant artificial-intelligence researcher Will Caster (Johnny Depp) who has been shot by a Luddite terrorist using a radiation-tipped bullet. (""You want to create a new god Your own god"" his assassin yells at him.) Wills wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) has the brilliant idea of uploading him into an existing artificial-intelligence system as a way of both keeping his mind alive and solving a technological problem. You see the big hump in AI research is how to explain conscience and consciousness to a machine however smart it may be. But by using an existing mind -- Wills -- they render the question moot. Man and machine will merge not supplant each other. Or so our heroes think. The upload is a success and soon enough Will who was a modest rumpled academic type in real life wants to expand and access financial networks and other sorts of databases. (I think he actually utters the words ""I need more power"") ""Fifteen minutes after he logs on he wants to plug into Wall Street?"" asks fellow scientist Max Waters (Paul Bettany). ""Thats not Will"" The question of to whom this new consciousness belongs -- is it Will or is it something else? -- is one the film asks multiple times tantalizingly but it never quite settles on an answer. Or rather it settles on an unsatisfying one that has more to do with hastily assembled third-act resolutions than with anything suggested in the narrative. Meanwhile the aforementioned Luddite terrorists are hot on Wills trail as are the Feds. So our new cyberprotagonist instructs Evelyn to go ""off the grid"" (what?) and directs her to a desolate town in the middle of the desert called Brightwood. With a bank account newly flush with Wills artificially intelligent high-frequency trading gains Evelyn buys the whole town and builds a giant new center where Will can expand the possibilities of what he can do -- which involves curing the sick and dying manipulating the weather and turning the down-and-out residents of the town into a kind of robot-zombie army. Science Transcendence wants to raise real questions about scientific hubris about the notion that science is always trying to perfect the world. Late in the film Max looks at the chaos around him and declares bitterly that its ""the end of a more primitive organic form of life and the dawn of a new advanced age."" He doesnt mean this in a good way. But everything with Wills new cyberidentity goes so wrong so quickly and in such a far-fetched manner that the films more philosophical aims come off as contrived; it doesnt earn its dystopia. What does work in Transcendence however is the human tragedy at the heart of Will and Evelyns relationship. Hall does loss well Were with her heartbreak at the impending death of her husband and when he finally responds from the other end of the digital-human divide we breathe the same sigh of relief. What makes the actresss performance all the more remarkable is that Depp essentially Skypes his performance in. One wonders how the films emotional valence might have changed had someone who could evoke our sympathy been cast as Will. Transcendence is an ambitious film. Director Wally Pfister has served as Christopher Nolans cinematographer on numerous features and he clearly wants to mimic Nolans successful fusing of pop and philosophy of breakneck action and high-minded portent. But he lacks Nolans shorthand the ability to convey complicated narrative concepts in speedy fashion which is the secret building-block of the directors dense narratives. As a result Transcendence never quite succeeds at telling a story of scientific overreach. And it doesnt really click as an action movie either. But as a human tragedy of man and monster of beauty and beast it has just enough genuine pathos that you wish it were better.

Transcendence review Brain uploaded logic goes out door 1 / 4 Back to Gallery In most horror movies the victims can be forgiven for their lack of sense. Its within the realm of possibility that a hormone-charged slightly dense 17-year-old might open the wrong door utter the forbidden words or ignore the obvious warnings to get off the mountain. In ""Transcendence"" the obtuse adults opening the wrong door are some of the worlds greatest scientific minds. Real scientists are going to hate this film. It suggests they are oblivious dimwits who dive headlong into potential catastrophe with no safeguards and little consideration of the morals or consequences. And then when catastrophe is surrounding them they make a nice chicken piccata sip wine and argue about their feelings. The directorial debut for ace cinematographer Wally Pfister is always watchable but the narrative flaws and logical leaps sabotage sustained enjoyment. ""Transcendence"" looks and sounds like a Christopher Nolan film that got attacked by malware. One huge positive for ""Transcendence"" Its never boring. The film has the fascinating vibe that happens when very talented people with a large amount of resources are making something unique. Nolan is the executive producer and Pfisters movie has that ""Inception""/""Memento"" ambience where audiences feel as if theyre on a ride that could take them anywhere. This ride just isnt quite as much fun. Johnny Depp stars as Dr. Will Caster a Berkeley artificial intelligence scientist whose partners have figured out how to upload a primates consciousness onto a computer. Caster and his wife/scientific partner Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) have also been working on a sentient machine which would never be made by anyone who has seen ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" or ""WarGames."" When revolutionaries seriously wound Caster Evelyn and colleague Max (Paul Bettany) hole up in an abandoned gymnasium and perform surgery hoping to upload Casters consciousness before he dies. Story problem No. 1 Well assume its even remotely possible that this Berkeley gym wouldnt already be inhabited by 47 squatters. And well assume it still somehow has the working electricity to power a bank of supercomputers. Are we supposed to believe that a pair of academics would be capable of performing an on-the-fly intracranial neurosurgery procedure? From there ""Transcendence"" presents itself as a smart movie while it bombards the viewer with confusing plot turns huge lapses in logic protagonists who act against their own interest and smart characters who are slow to realize the obvious. For every really good story idea there are two more problems that will make you shake your head. Story problem No. 2 The government which would have 20 agents assigned to follow Casters every move in the real world appears to assign one mid-level investigator to the case after a terrorism-related tragedy. The revolutionaries are gaining strength? The same investigator is in charge. The fate of mankind hangs in the balance? OK well let the single FBI agent order around a dozen soldiers too. But dont wake up the president ... So now you have the bad news. While it fails as an airtight sci-fi thriller ""Transcendence"" is still a decent ""Twilight Zone"" episode. The off-putting moments are reminiscent of the science-experiment-gone-wrong themes in the underrated ""Splice"" or a good David Cronenberg creep-out. The problems seem to rest more with the edits than with the work of ""Transcendence"" screenwriter Jack Paglen whose overly serious yet detail-oriented script yields some fun surprises. And Depp embraces the many complications of being a warped version of humanity pulling off subtle emotional changes along with one or two bizarro turns. Depp critics can complain that hes been uploading all of his performances since 1997. But you wouldnt want anyone else in this role. (OK maybe Nicolas Cage ...) Cinema is a better place when filmmakers like Pfister and Nolan and Alfonso Cuaron and Neill Blomkamp can explore new ideas and original scripts instead of squeezing out the 47th ""Spider-Man"" reboot for Sony Pictures. The finished product may be messy with ""Transcendence"" but at least its not like everything else. One more note for Bay Area residents While it appears that much of the film was shot outside the Bay Area ""Transcendence"" does have the best use of San Pablo Avenue in a film since Pixars ""The Incredibles.""

No matter - Transcendence an ambitious if over-familiar debut film from Christopher The Dark Knight Nolans regular cinematographer Wally Pfister is clearly science fiction. Depp plays a visionary scientist with the allegorical name of Will Caster who promises his artificial intelligence research will bring about human ""transcendence"" from our biological straitjackets. When he faces his untimely end to his biological life Will has just enough time to transfer his consciousness to a computer and becomes a dreamer with his head permanently in the cloud. Johnny Depp plays Will Caster a scientist who uploads his brain into an artificial intelligence. Video Video Weekend movie pick Johnny Depp is almost too good at acting lifeless in Transcendence So how does that work out for him? Not so well as we learn in the movies opening minutes. The story is narrated by yet another scientist Max (Paul Bettany) reflecting back on the ""unstoppable collision between mankind and technology"" as he wanders around the post-technological Berkeley Calif. where everyone bicycles (as they do now) but computer keyboards are now used as doorstops and once-cherished smartphones litter the gutters like pop cans.Five years earlier Max tells us the future looked much shinier. We meet Will and his wife Evelyn first seen preparing for a fundraising event for their supercomputer PINN (Physically Independent Neural Network) which looks like the usual rows of metal lockers lined with beeping lights and speaks in a feminine monotone. (One of the disappointments of Transcendence is that everything in the future looks like movies from the early nineties.) On the same day as Wills speech in which he promises PINN will do everything from fix the environment to cure cancer a terrorist group led by a hippie-punk activist named Bree (House of Cards Kate Mara) launches a series of simultaneous Godfather-like strikes on other artificial intelligence labs around the United States.Though Wills lab survives he is shot with a radioactive bullet designed to ensure a lingering death by the nasty neo-Luddites. Conveniently that leaves him just enough time to shave his head attach some electrodes and transfer his mental data to PINNs mainframe augmenting her big cyber-brain with a human will and possibly conscience. Whether this new techno-deity is a sinister or benign force constitutes the nominal tension of Transcendence which is essentially Frankenstein meets the World Wide Web.At first things look dire. In a couple of mouse clicks the new virtual Will has rigged the stock market purchased a desert town built an underground solar-powered lab and engineered a race of network-linked hillbilly cyborgs to do his bidding. Evelyn still grief-stricken has become a virtual slave to the all-knowing dead husband who surveils her from flickering screens around the house and monitors her hormone levels. And thats barely scratching the surface of things because Transcendence written by Jack Paglen is not so much sweeping drama as one thats exhaustingly over-plotted.One storyline follows Morgan Freeman as Wills mentor Professor Tagger who first works with an FBI agent Buchanan (Cillian Murphy) to thwart the terrorists and then focus on Will. In another story Max (Bettany) gets kidnapped by the terrorist group who view his anti-technology writings as their ideological foundational texts. Meanwhile out in the desert Wills big project involves fields of solar panels and deep underground bunkers nano-technology machines in the water supply re-animated bodies and holograms. All of it feels far too derivative to feel urgent.As a cinematographer Pfister provided Nolans films with their dark intense lustre but here he delegates d.o.p. duties to Jess Hall (Hot Fuzz Creation) for a conventionally good-looking display of sleek sci-fi monumentality. Apart from Mychael Dannas portentous orchestral and electronic score Transcendence simply lacks oomph Shots dont overwhelm scenes dont pop and nothing on the screen gets under your skin.Unlike the eighties sci-fi films it echoes - from David Cronenberg Paul Verhoeven James Cameron and John Carpenter - Transcendence is just too disembodied to make the pulse quicken. Its a backhanded compliment to Depps method acting skills that his character here is truly lifeless all shimmering pixels and echoing vocals devoid of mischief humour or sex appeal. For all his big brain skills he cant contrive even good simulation of an erotic charge with his wife played by the regal Rebecca Hall who is near catatonic in her state of stricken anxiety. Lost in the land of mind over matter Transcendence is too much trance and not nearly enough dance.

"Transcendence | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Transcendence Print Page Email Page Search Transcendence (2014; Rated ) A "" Bold beautiful sometimes confounding flight of futuristic speculation firmly rooted in the potential of todays technology."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Transcendence(2014; PG-13)In theaters Friday 18 April 2014Genre Drama Mystery Science FictionDirector Wally PfisterCast Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall Morgan Freeman New Richard Roeper reviews weekdays at 500 PM ET only on REELZCHANNEL (10) Post a Comment  Ericsaid on Saturday August 30 2014 104552 PMYet another dead-on review (Roeper nails the thrillers). Three reasons people didnt like this film 1) Their religious views got in the way. 2) Their political views got in the way (the anti-establishment conspiracy crowd ended up being wrong which is an ironic reason to dislike the film considering that twist was one of the unexpected pleasures to the objective viewers). 3) They just didnt get it (anyone who thought it was ""boring"" ""unfocused"" or far-fetched just didnt follow the story or how nanotechnology worked so took their frustrations out in their review). If you have a good imagination and can watch the film objectively youll probably enjoy the film and understand why Roeper gave it an A. KoMingsaid on Monday August 18 2014 34543 PMI really really wanted to like this movie. I thought it was courageous it took chances and it actually had a credible grasp of where the leading edge of the science currently is. The production values were excellent blending CGI and on-location shots quite seamlessly. However there were problems. I am a computer scientist myself and I cant help but think most movies this one included dont do a good job of understanding this one thing computers do what we tell them to. They do EXACTLY what we tell them to. If we dont want them to take over the world we should just omit the instructions for taking over the world from the source code. Obviously fear of being supplanted as the dominant intelligence (?) on the planet seems to be a common theme in film but neither apes nor computers are currently a credible threat. Yes when that computer beats you the Grandmaster at chess it was really just another human being that beat you. Only she cheated because she used a computer to cheat the time-restriction rules. She gets nearly infinite time (because of advances in processor power) while you still get 40 minutes. Cheating or not she still has to understand that various rules and strategies of chess to program it correctly. Sure I had a concentration in AI. I get it its a program that learns and alters its own code. Sure it has the potential to do things that it wasnt intended to do. Most (if not all) of our current software already has this feature their called ""bugs"". One thing the movie got really RIGHT in my opinion is that the uploaded memories of Will werent actually Will. Wills consciousness wasnt actually transffered just information. I wont dare to go further into THAT conversation here as there simply isnt enough space to do so. No what disappointed me most about the film was that as brave as it was it stopped short of where I wanted it to go. Could science be the benevolent tool that helps us? Could we one day acquire the wisdom to wield such tools? Might we not finally mature into a species that can handle things like living for stupidly long times and recovering from what used to be crippling illnesses and injuries? Why does it always have to be ""creepy"" instead of progressive? I think that a large segment of the population takes a strong ethical stance dividing activities labeled ""God"" and ""Human"" and dont take kindly to mixing and matching. I was really hoping this movie would be the one to finally break through that wall but it wasnt. Right from the get-go it tries to get us to sympathize with radical terrorists who are guilty of everything from murder (slow painful murder via radioactive bullets) kidnapping treason and bad acting. Apparently all this is OK so long as we dont try to become better scientists. Whos at fault here the technology or the people who misuse it? Its never quite explained WHY the uploaded Will computer wants power and wants to take over things. Who was the jerk that sneaked in those lines of code? Joesaid on Wednesday May 28 2014 110130 AMPlease Richard update your website So many of us use iPads or iPhones etc and your Flash videos are not viewable. Flash is outdated and Im sure you would like us mobile users to see your reviews too Daniel Prinnsaid on Sunday May 25 2014 120241 AMHi Richard I dont really agree with the review because I was a bit disappointed by the film. Well I do agree with the idea that you have to either go with the film or not. I gave it a 5/10 so I didnt hate it but I didnt love it either. I read your review on Chicago Sun-Times (Im a big fan of yours I think youre very witty and youre one of my inspirations to be a film critic) and even though you give it 4 stars out of 4 Im earnestly curious as to why this is an A and not an A+? Anyway keep up the good work. Its fun to disagree with your views sometimes ) Spud Spunkmieirsaid on Thursday May 08 2014 72015 AMThis proves Mr. Roeper is paid to do good reviews for complete garbage F- movies like this nonsensical trash. AMsaid on Sunday May 04 2014 34623 PMThe film was quite a surprise especially when I went to see it with no expectations based on bad reviews it got. Maybe because I didnt expect much. Its a beautiful film. Unplugsaid on Friday May 02 2014 44512 PMNO NO NO Transendance is nothing more than a mash up of ""Wargames"" ""Her"" and the ""Cowboy Bepob"" episode ""Brain Scratch"". The show also makes a clear rip from Bepob when Depp if flying in the internet. Rod Sterling and Bradbury would laugh so hard at this movie. Sandysaid on Monday April 21 2014 115400 AMGreat great movie Youll love this if you enjoy movies that explore the possible results of combining great minds.....visionaries......with technology. Chris Michaelssaid on Saturday April 19 2014 43143 PMHeres a circumstance where I place value on Richards review (and Turan) above the consensus and will invest to see the film. Will advise.

"Review Transcendence rises above the sci-fi genre - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Transcendence rises above the sci-fi genre Transcendence Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Transcendence starring Johnny Depp Paul Bettany Rebecca Hall and Kate Mara. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Transcendence starring Johnny Depp Paul Bettany Rebecca Hall and Kate Mara. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Though its plot and premise are pure science fiction ""Transcendence"" goes pleasingly against the genre grain.A story of the possible perils and pleasures of artificial intelligence that stars Johnny Depp ""Transcendences"" ideas are at least as involving as its images if not more so. And as written by Jack Paglen and directed by Wally Pfister this film is intent on not limiting itself to simplistic questions of pure good and evil. As ""Transcendences"" narrative of the battle between pro and anti-technology forces unfolds justice is done to the complicated factors at play here. Determining with certainty whom the heroes and villains of this narrative are is not so easily done.PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013 | Biggest flops of 2013 Though Pfister is well-known as Christopher Nolans longtime cinematographer (nominated for four Oscars a winner for ""Inception"") both he and screenwriter Paglen are first-timers in their respective chairs and there are times when that shows. ""Transcendences"" exposition is not always sharp emotional connections (with the exception of Depps outstanding costar Rebecca Hall) are not its strength and it does not make memorable use of its Imax format.But because the underlying ideas are involving those problems fade from view leaving us with an ambitious and provocative piece of work that is intriguingly balanced between being a warning and a celebration.Certainly the boon-or-bane question of artificial intelligence has been a movie staple at least since the days of HAL 9000 in Stanley Kubricks ""2001."" (In fact a purely negative example of some of this films ideas appears in the current ""Captain America Winter Soldier."")""Transcendence"" begins in the near future maybe as close as tomorrow. Narrator Max Waters (an excellent Paul Bettany) walks through the streets of a Berkeley patrolled by armed soldiers. The city --- and every other city we soon learn -- is in the grip of some kind of worldwide power blackout. Max walks to a classic wood shingle Berkeley house now in ruins but once the home of Dr. Will Caster (Depp) and his wife Evelyn (Hall). Max knew them better than anyone he says and he is prepared to vouch for the fact that they wanted nothing but the best for humanity.BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenBack we go five years to the bulk of ""Transcendences"" story. Depps Will is a brilliant scientist distracted in a Disney Gyro Gearloose kind of way but enough of a celebrated futurist to have people asking for signatures on his Wired magazine cover story.Evelyn is the more focused half of the couple eager to raise money for the practical applications of Wills ideas which means attendance at an Evolve the Future conference where the good doctor talks about the lure of what he calls transcendence.""Once online a sentient machine will quickly overcome the limits of biology"" he says. ""Its analytical power will be greater than the collective intelligence of every person born in the history of the world. Imagine such an entity with the full range of emotions even self-awareness.""For some people in the audience that is not a dream but a nightmare. These are the members of RIFT (Revolutionary Independence From Technology if you must know) ""Unplug"" tattoos on their forearms and anarchic mayhem in their hearts. In fact their leader Bree (Kate Mara) looks so clearly deranged its amazing she was even allowed in the auditorium.RIFT soon does its worst and as an end result Will ends up with only a few weeks to live. Though the couples best friend Max expresses doubts Rebecca sees only one way out a scenario that involves yet another acronym PINN.PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesThat would be the Physically Independent Neural Network artificial intelligence system Will has created. Rebecca decides to upload her husbands mind to PINNs core. ""We can save him"" she insists to Maxs dismay and though the experiment appears to succeed the much more complex question becomes at what cost to humanity.Once Will is fully inside the machine ""Transcendences"" main action begins and the film becomes more involving. Because Depps mechanical performance is nothing to write home about the film counts on Halls great ability to join intelligence with empathy. (Those who havent seen her and ""Spider-Man"" Andrew Garfield co-star in the first part of 2009s ""Red Riding Trilogy"" should catch up now.) Initially what we see is all the things this smartest-entity-ever puts into motion how it keeps itself alive and how it works to increase its range and power. Just as interesting however are the conflicts doubts and fears that Wills transformation causes not the least of them being Maxs worry about whether that it is really Will inside the machine and not some bizarre iteration with a mind of its own.Most pointed is the resistance many of ""Transcendences"" characters feel to Wills evolution into what they call ""an unnatural abomination and a threat to humanity."" Are their qualms justified or is it a question that as someone says ""people fear what they dont understand."" These are very difficult questions and the best thing about ""Transcendence"" is that it refuses to pretend otherwise. kenneth.turanlatimes.com----------------------------------TranscendenceMPAA rating PG-13 for sci-fi action and violence some blood images brief strong language and sensualityRunning time 1 hour 59 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Action (Movie Genre) Science Johnny Depp Fiction Rebecca Hall Transcendence ponders as it propels Johnny Depps Transcendence to open same day in China and U.S. Johnny Depps Transcendence poised for subdued U.S. launch Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-transcendence-review20140418,0,6075185.story#axzz2z2n8SEPa",200,transcendence16,transcendence,latimes
"Transcendence starring Johnny Depp and Rebecca Hall reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Transcendence Asks Is It a Good Idea to Upload Johnny Depp to a Supercomputer? Transcendence Asks Is It a Good Idea to Upload Johnny Depp to a Supercomputer? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 17 2014 655 PM Transcendence The perils of uploading Johnny Depp to a supercomputer. By Dana Stevens Johnny Depp everywhere. Photo courtesy Peter Mountain/Alcon Entertainment Think of the sci-fi thriller Transcendence--the first feature film directed by Christopher Nolans longtime cinematographer Wally Pfister--as a companion piece to Spike Jonzes moody artificial-intelligence romance Her. Both films take place in not-too-distant futures--one apocalyptic the other deceptively rosy--in which the line between technology and human consciousness has grown vanishingly thin. In both a human protagonist falls in love (or in Transcendences case remains in love) with a digital entity whose ontological status is never quite clear Is a person without a living body whose memories thoughts and feelings are encoded as data in a machine still a person? And in both movies the consequences of this attempt to love across the human-machine barrier are unforeseeable far-reaching and potentially destructive to the civilized world (or at least Joaquin Phoenixs heart). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Transcendence is nowhere near as elegant witty or insightful as Her. Pfister and the screenwriter Jack Paglen grapple ponderously sometimes oafishly with the ethical and philosophical issues at stake in the films premise. But they grapple with them and that earnest investment in the speculative part of  ""speculative science fiction"" is what makes Transcendence worth watching at least until it falls apart in a last-act barrage of nonsensical plot developments and soothing TED-talk wisdom. Transcendence is fairly ridiculous but some may prefer its grand loopy ambition to the small-minded sameness of so many futuristic thrillers. Johnny Depp plays a reclusive tech visionary with the vaguely foreshadowy name of Will Caster who along with his brilliant and beloved wife Evelyn (the willowy Rebecca Hall late of Vicki Cristina Barcelona more recently of Iron Man 3) has been developing a fast-evolving supercomputer nicknamed PINN--a roomful of powerful servers thats close to achieving something like a consciousness. Asked if ""she"" can say something to prove shes self-aware the machine cheekily responds to her human questioner ""Can you?"" Advertisement The only other two people alive smart enough to understand this technology apparently are the Casters neurobiologist friend Max (Paul Bettany) and their former colleague Tagger (Morgan Freeman) an A.I. guru at a computer-science lab. While the Casters are giving a talk about the exciting real-world implications of their advancing discoveries Taggers lab is destroyed and his entire team killed in an attack by a shady ""Neo-Luddite"" terrorist group headed by a bleached-blond Kate Mara who we already know from House of Cards to be an untrustworthy bit of baggage. Usurping Gods place as the creator of life has a way of not working out like you thought it would. In a second nearly simultaneous terrorist attack Will is grazed by a bullet thats been laced with radiation and is given only weeks to live. Evelyn working to save him by any means necessary makes a frantic last-ditch proposal to Max Before Will dies theyll encode his brain function--memory emotion language everything--and upload it into the PINN servers so his consciousness can live on after his physical body is dead. Sounds like a plan right? Except that as Victor Frankenstein can attest hubristically usurping Gods place as the creator of life has a way of not working out like you thought it would. Only minutes after coming online following his bodily death Will--at first seen only as a line of text on a computer screen--is asking for access to information about the worlds banking system and educational databases. Those red flags go unnoticed by the ecstatic Evelyn whose joy at being reunited with her beloved is such that she banishes her collaborator Max when he expresses skepticism about the motives of whoever or whatever is passing itself off as Will. In the second half of the movie Evelyn (whos now among the worlds wealthiest women thanks to Wills posthumous financial chicanery) moves to a desert town called Brightwood to build a vast cultlike scientific compound that will house her late husbands ever-expanding and ever-more-ambitious consciousness. Its in these scenes that Pfister gets to show off the eye for the stark compositions and large-scale effects he demonstrated in Nolan movies like Inception and The Dark Knight. There are no gracefully somersaulting tractor-trailers or Parisian streets folding in on themselves but there are Kubrick-esque all-white corridors with impossibly distant vanishing points and clouds of sentient nanobot-dust that spiral up from the ground in glittering green-gray tornados. A lot of it is spectacular to look at and to the movies credit the romance that drives the story forward is neither vapid nor (the ending excepted) sentimental. Sci-fi elements aside Transcendence tells the tale of a compulsively enabling woman trapped in a really bad relationship with a much more powerful man--a situation that can make for affecting drama even if the guy in question isnt evolving at lightning speed into an omniscient digital consciousness. That ending though (and by ending I mean about the last 20 minutes)--oy. Without giving anything away I can say it takes us closer to Nicholas Sparks territory than the director probably intended and squanders a lot of viewer goodwill along the way. Top Comment Does the machine run Windows XP? Dont they know its no longer officially supported by Microsoft and that continuing to use it will mean the slow and agonizing death of the hero?  More... -EdG Join In Transcendence poses more ominously a question that Her raised in passing and that I hope future technologically themed sci-fi will pick up on If your hyper-connected virtual lover can observe you at every minute--as you sleep as you drive as you dine alone in a room with their disembodied image hovering on a screen--whats the difference between devotion and surveillance? There was a hint of psychological horror in the creepy late scenes between the disenchanted Evelyn and the increasingly controlling Will that made me think Wally Pfister may have a really good science-fiction thriller in him. This isnt that movie--its more of an imperfect facsimile which as Transcendence shows can take you pretty far but not the whole way.

"Transcendence | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; transcendence ) Transcendence (United States/United Kingdom 2014) April 18 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli To be fair Transcendence contains its share of ""big ideas"" - science fiction tropes that have fascinated readers and viewers for decades ever since the concept of computer sentience became fodder for stories and movies. Unfortunately it takes more than grand concepts to make a movie and the lack of cinematic connective tissue is apparent in this poorly focused meandering and ultimately disappointing film. Arguably more than any other genre science fiction has an obligation to seduce the viewer into applying the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" (the means by which contrivances are overlooked). With its plot holes and head-scratching incongruities Transcendence fails in this arena thereby making the production as a whole feel bloated and unsatisfying. Johnny Depp plays Will Caster a computer genius who is close to making a key breakthrough in the advancement of artificial intelligence. This makes him the target of fringe terrorist groups who believe the rise of the computer is leading to the downfall of humankind. They strike out at Will critically injuring him. With only five weeks to live he begins the process of uploading his consciousness into the most advanced computer on earth - a project continued by his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and a colleague Max Waters (Paul Bettany) after his death. The process works but the ""transcended"" Will is a cold dangerous entity whose sole goal is the accumulation of knowledge and power. Max is immediately aware of the situation and alerts others including fellow computer scientist Joseph Tagger (Morgan Freeman) and FBI agent Buchanan (Cillian Murphy). But it takes longer for Evelyn to realize that the ""Will"" in the machine is no longer the man she loved. This is the directorial debut for Wally Pfister the veteran cinematographer who has worked behind the camera on all of Christopher Nolans films since Memento. The film which was shot on film in a digital era looks great and the special effects are first-rate but the same degree of care wasnt accorded to things like storytelling and character development. There are chunks of Transcendence that dont make sense including a bit about a computer virus. Theres no chemistry between Johnny Depp and Rebecca Hall and their characters love story so critical to making the narrative come alive never feels real. Theres a powerful romantic tragedy in Transcendence but it never achieves critical mass. Theres also a key structural flaw. The screenplay credited to Jack Paglen opts to present the majority of the story as a flashback. To that end we start with a world where the Internet no longer exists (and its absence has taken down the power grid) and the main characters are no more. There doesnt seem to be a compelling reason to present things using this chronology and it leeches away much-needed tension. All the while as Computer-Wills power is growing we know how things are going to turn out. This makes it difficult to remain invested in the narrative. Pfisters high industry profile allowed him to assemble a top-notch cast (although Christian Bale originally pegged to play Will had to drop out because of scheduling conflicts). Depp is strangely muted here which some might consider a pleasant change after a recent series of over-the-top roles. Rebecca Hall is off-key struggling to find the right note for an underwritten yet critical character. Paul Bettany Cillian Murphy and Morgan Freeman (the latter two worked with Pfister on the Batman movies) are underused. They spend a lot of time standing around not doing much. Those who are fascinated by the potential for computer sentience will find some things in Transcendence to mull over although the most compelling aspects of the movie are derivative. Parts of the film hearken back to a TV episode of the original Star Trek (""Where No Man Has Gone Before"") that aired in 1966. A more recent antecedent is Spike Jonzes Her which asks some of the same questions with greater eloquence and resonance.

"Transcendence is a techno tale both visionary and myopic review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTranscendence is a techno tale both visionary and myopic reviewWhat Transcendence has going for it is evolution rather than revolution the real and advancing dread that were losing our humanity as we embrace all things plugged-in and online.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 17 2014TranscendenceStarring Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall Morgan Freeman Paul Bettany Kate Mara Cillian Murphy and Clifton Collins Jr. Directed by Wally Pfister. At GTA theatres. 117 minutes. PGWally Pfisters Transcendence isnt the alarm-ringing saga of mechanical mayhem it aspires to be having come late to the notion of silicon slavery.Filmmakers have contemplated a machine takeover of mankind since at least 1927 when Fritz Langs Metropolis employed Brigitte Helm as a scarily sexy robot-human hybrid. Similar fears have been explored in 2001 A Space Odyssey The Matrix Trilogy The Lawnmower Man and innumerable other movies.Article Continued BelowWhat Transcendence has going for it is evolution rather than revolution the real and advancing dread that were slowly losing our humanity as we embrace all things plugged-in and online. The dawn of sentient computers -- the ""transcendence"" of the title -- may truly be upon us and its not a good feeling.Johnny Depp peers down on from left Morgan Freeman Cillian Murphy and Rebecca Hall in Transcendence the latest man-versus-technology movie  (Peter Mountain / AP)  So frets first-time director Pfister best known as Christopher Nolans director of photography. Hes assembled a good cast a few strong images and a workmanlike script by Jack Paglen (another rookie) to craft a cautionary tale that is at once visionary and myopic.Johnny Depp is Dr. Will Caster a leading researcher in artificial intelligence who is close to making a scientific breakthrough with the assistance of his wife and fellow brainiac Evelyn (Rebecca Hall).Together they toil on PINN (Physically Independent Neural Network) a smart-machine project that Caster naively assumes will only be used for good things such as finding cures for cancer and Alzheimers.An ambush by an anti-technology group -- either terrorists or heroes depending on your point of view -- sets in motion events that will not only drastically change Casters existence but that of everybody on Earth.Caster becomes one with the machine (""My mind has been set free"") and also malevolent using his newly obtained powers and the globe-spanning Internet to exploit and enslave people. He manipulates both the stock market and human DNA to buy land and create an army of cyborgs obviously figuring that the Metropolis machine-human was a good idea.Seeking to stop him are two other scientists played by Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman who have developed serious misgivings about technology; a brave but bootless FBI man (Cillian Murphy); and the determined anti-techno group leader (Kate Mara) who looks less like a terrorist and more like a hero with each whir and clank of Casters takeover plan.Pfister wants us to seriously think about the dangers of unchecked mechanization going so far as to include numerous close-ups of water -- from droplets to puddles -- that are obviously meant as a Malickian mediation on things natural and real.The latter includes some genuine chemistry between Depp and Hall which puts heart and soul into this machine.Little attempt is made to surprise us. The film opens five years past the events of the main narrative with Bettanys Max Waters best friend to Caster walking through a completely unplugged Berkeley Calif.He mutters via voice-over how ""things are far from what they were"" now that the Internet is gone and electricity is but a rumour.Spoiler alert needed? Only if youve never seen a movie about uppity machines before.Transcendence follows such a predictable path its almost as if -- shudder -- it had been made by very thoughtful robots.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Peter Mountain/Warner Brothers Pictures hide caption toggle caption Peter Mountain/Warner Brothers Pictures Morgan Freeman Cillian Murphy Rebecca Hall and the floating head of Johnny Depp in Transcendence. Peter Mountain/Warner Brothers Pictures Director Wally Pfister Genre Science Fiction Running Time 119 minutes With Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall Paul Bettany Morgan Freeman Cillian Murphy Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action and violence some bloody images brief strong language and sensuality Transcendence seems like the perfect film for Wally Pfister to kick off his career as a director. Pfister emerged as one of the best cinematographers in the business through his collaborations with Christopher Nolan (which also won him an Oscar for Inception) and one of the hallmarks of that collaboration has been their dogged commitment to shooting on film rather than digitally even as the industry has rapidly abandoned the 20th century technology. With Transcendence a science-fiction tale about an artificial digital intelligence putting our old-fashioned analog intelligence at risk of eradication Pfister gets to play out that philosophical battle at a level with life-or-death stakes. He establishes Will Caster (Johnny Depp) as a man with feet on both sides of that divide Hes the worlds leading researcher in artificial intelligence technology a man whose life is devoted to creating consciousness out of circuit boards but his sanctuary at home is a lush green garden where he listens to old LPs on a record player. Caster fits neatly into sci-fi archetype as a scientist interested in the noble pursuit of pure knowledge -- its how that knowledge is used by others that winds up becoming a problem. As he says at one speaking engagement its his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) who wants to change the world; he just wants to understand it. Not everyone views his intentions as so honorable and when an organization known as RIFT (Revolutionary Independence from Technology) takes out most of his colleagues in a coordinated attack and leaves him with one month to live its Evelyn who suggests using his AI technology to allow the contents of his mind to live on after his body has died. Is the technology ready to house the fullness of a human mind? Their friend and technological ethicist Max (Paul Bettany) raises some cautionary objections but Evelyn insists. What could really go wrong with such good intentions? Plenty as it turns out. As Casters consciousness and processing power grows so does its malevolent danger and the story begins to draw on a variety of deadly sci-fi influences from 2001 A Space Odyssey (Depp particularly seems to be consciously channeling HALs creepy placidity once he is reborn into ones and zeros) to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. But as it turns out the more relevant (and gentler) touchstone is more recent Not unlike last years Her what the film really hinges on is the tricky notion of love between flesh-and-blood humans and sentient machines. All of this feels not unlike Christopher Nolans own films grand gorgeous works filled with stunning imagery that are as full of Big Ideas as they are Big Entertainment. Regular Nolan cast members like Cillian Murphy and Morgan Freeman (as an FBI agent and another tech researcher respectively) bolster that notion. But whats harder to borrow is the directors gift for telling those big stories so effortlessly and its here where Pfister and Transcendence stumble hard. Transcendence has hints of a richly complex story but too often feels content just dumping the pieces of its puzzle out on the table without doing much assembly -- or even making sure all the pieces are even there. Eliding certain details and allowing the imagination of the viewer to fill in blanks is essential to any fiction science especially but too often Pfisters choices gloss over things like essential character development or even basic cues for the passage of time -- the massive underground compound that eventually houses Wills mind feels as though it blinks into existence in a matter of days. Without real engagement with the characters no matter how pretty the movie is (and its very very pretty) it cant help but feel hollow and more than a little dull. So while the subject matter might be well-matched to Pfisters particular interests its hard to get around the fact that no matter how much time he has spent behind a camera this is still his first time as director. Nolan started small on films like Following and Memento before trying his hand at anything remotely this ambitious. Pfisters years spent developing a visual style may be visible right up there on the screen but so too are the years he hasnt yet spent controlling all aspects of the storytelling process. Evelyn isnt the only one here who tries reaching too high too fast.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 658am on Friday Apr. 18 2014 Friday Apr. 18 2014 Friday Apr. 18 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram That man would have the hubris to reach the level of a god is a notion that has long animated both myth and literature. To see such ambition brought low is a story that never gets old and that premise is the best part of Transcendence a belabored science-fiction fantasy that aims for what its title advertises and falls far short.In his first film as director acclaimed cinematographer Wally Pfister ( The Dark Knight Rises Inception) has made a movie that predictably looks good but has little substance beneath its shiny digitally enhanced surface.Johnny Depp is Will Caster the Tony Stark of artificial intelligence a hotshot scientist and Wired cover boy on the verge of a breakthrough in the merging of man and machine that he believes could be the answer to hunger disease and other global ills. His best hope is a computer called PINN (Physically Independent Neural Network).But the work he and his colleagues -- including his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and best friend Max (Paul Bettany) -- are doing has sparked opposition from a terrorist group called RIFT (Revolutionary Independence from Technology). This outfit -- whose slogan is ""evolution without technology"" -- wants to unplug humanity from machines altogether.This doesnt include explosive devices and guns though and the group uses them to take out many of those working with Depp and another AI pioneer Joseph Tagger (Morgan Freeman). Their attempt on Wills life at first seems to have failed -- he is shot but survives -- but it turns out the bullet was coated with a radioactive material. With only weeks to live Will along with Evelyn and Max decide to upload Wills mind into PINN so that his brilliance is preserved.Of course the law of unintended consequences being what it is Wills ego and sense of power increase exponentially once his mind is paired with the seemingly limitless power of a machine that can tap into all of the worlds computers and see everything everywhere. Will wants to eradicate cancer and conflict -- a good thing -- but seeks to link everyone in a ""hive mind"" with him at the controls. Not so good.Thats when both Evelyn and Max who are totally Team Will at first come to the realization that maybe this whole man-machine thing wasnt such a bright idea after all.While Transcendence has nothing new to say about absolute power corrupting absolutely or the friction between technology and humanity it still could have been an engaging thriller. But its lined with plot holes so big that they take you right out of the movie. Evelyn while still in Wills thrall marches into a desert town with millions wired into her bank account by all-powerful Will hires a crew of local neer-do-wells and then seemingly overnight secretly builds a sprawling wired campus that makes Google headquarters look like a tiki shack. Its from here that Will like The Brain on the old Pinky and the Brain cartoons plans to take over the world. But wouldnt someone take notice? The local power company? The mayor? The NSA?And then the explosions start and Transcendence goes the way of so many big-budget movies where performances are subservient to special effects. But even on this basic level Transcendence isnt very special.Humanitys hubris may indeed be dangerous but Hollywoods is just boring.

Siri? Anybody? Here we have an Internet-age Frankenstein both in the themes of the story and the misbegotten patched-together film itself. In his first and likely last outing as a director cinematographer Wally Pfister delivers a garbled dispiriting pseudo-cerebral non-thriller. Johnny Depp plays an exceedingly dull artificial-intelligence researcher whose work on giving machine systems human consciousness will hasten the arrival of the Singularity the moment when computers cognitive powers outstrip humanitys. He is a man of wisdom committed to making the world a better place. A Luddite terrorist cell disagrees accusing him of creating a false god. When their assassination attempt leaves him mortally wounded his scientist wife (Rebecca Hall) and fellow researcher (Paul Bettany) upload his awareness into a supercomputer. Next thing you know hes talking to them through a computer screen avatar and performing nanotech miracles like a cybernetic Jesus. He sets up shop in a dusty backwater recruits a coven of followers and faces the wrath of a government frightened by his rise. Can even a selfless scientist resist the temptation to abuse the power that comes with infinite intelligence? A more apt question Can even seasoned actors elevate stilted overwritten dialogue inane plotting and flat characters? Not in this outing. Depps approach to playing an intellectual is a fixed expression of furrowed-brow concentration and a bone-dry monotone. His serious remorseful look is intended to convey a noble spirit burdened by weighty thoughts but he comes off as a sad sack. You sort of hope that once he takes his evolutionary leap of consciousness Depps avatar will cut loose and grow a beaded beard or wear a dead crow on his head or evolve scissorhands. No such luck. Hes Mr. Frowny throughout. His character has experienced the most amazing sanity-shaking transformation in human history yet he has no emotional arc. transcendence  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sci-fi action and violence some bloody images brief strong language and sensuality. The rest of the cast is equally ineffective. Hall pops her eyes to express intense emotion and Bettany lingers on the sidelines looking concerned. While the actors flounder and the narrative structure crumbles around him Pfister busies himself setting up nice-looking shots. It is safe to say that two of his favorite things in the world are hallways that stretch to infinity and slo-mo water droplets. Someone should have warned Pfister that a first-time director working with a first-time screenwriter is not a formula for surefire success. Jack Paglens script unfurls like a bad dream leaping from future to past to more recent past and back again with foggy surreal illogic. ""Transcendence"" imagines that a terrorist can wipe out a research lab with a poisoned chocolate cake by getting a job at the bakery. It creates a character with absolutely no narrative function for Morgan Freeman because hey Morgan Freeman. It oscillates artlessly between meditations on the meaning of life and lots of megaplex-rattling explosions. It frames its story as a flashback of a marginal character who didnt witness most of the action on-screen. Hello? My favorite moment came when Hall Bettany and Freeman gathered at a lakeside to scatter Depps ashes. The script specifies that he died of a particularly virulent form of radiation poisoning. The trio solemnly pour out his cremation urn while wisps of radioactive death-dust whirl around them. I do not believe that world-renowned scientists would do this.

PETER MOUNTAIN BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Transcendence Starring Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall Morgan Freeman Paul Bettany Directed by Wally Pfister Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action and violence some bloody images brief strong language and sensuality Running time 1 hour 59 minutes Playing In wide release (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitConfusing and confused this cautionary sci-fi tale about the perils of artificial intelligence builds up audience goodwill then squanders it. Grade C+ Its a good thing this movie isnt called ""Coherence."" The first film directed by cinematographer Wally Pfister best known for his work on Christopher Nolans ""Inception"" and ""Dark Knight"" trilogy ""Transcendence"" boasts some clever and beautiful images an intriguing premise and a terrific cast top to bottom. It also suffers from haphazard storytelling and a dumbfounding final act. The action unfolds in Berkeley and other Northern California locales before detouring to an obscure desert town. In the beginning even its antagonistic acronyms are brisk and sprightly - PINN stands for Physically Independent Neural Network and RIFT is Revolutionary Independence From Technology. By the end I thought it left its brain in San Francisco. For a while its fun to see Johnny Depp act within a normal emotional range without extreme makeup or prosthetics. He and Rebecca Hall mesh brilliantly with a droll simmering simpatico as Will and Evelyn Caster married specialists in artificial intelligence. Will PINNs creator eloquently lays out the prospect that a sentient thinking machine could achieve limitless analytic power. Evelyn preaches its potential real-world benefits - including curing disease and healing wounded ecosystems. Paul Bettany complements them both as their pal Max a neurobiologist who articulates the dangers of technology gone wild. Will calls him the third most intelligent person he knows. Its fitting that Will uses the lyrical word ""transcendence"" rather than the established term ""singularity"" to describe PINNs potential synthesis of intellect emotion and self-awareness. Hes got a touch of the poet. When a RIFT militant shoots Will with a poisoned bullet (part of a coordinated attack on AI workers throughout the country) the distraught Evelyn decides to ""upload"" her husbands mind during his final days of biological life. With Maxs help she feeds the data from Wills synapses neurons and gray cells into a super-computer. Once Will pops up on a monitor as a digital image of his former self he urges Evelyn to make drastic moves to protect and extend his powers. He soon proves his own prediction. Putting Will in PINN form online enables him to outstrip mankinds collective and historical intelligence. From this moment on the film recklessly melds scenarios from sci-fi milestones like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and every computer-run-wild movie from ""Colossus The Forbin Project"" to ""Demon Seed."" Max runs off in horror but in a desert hamlet called Brightville (formerly nicknamed ""Blightville"") Evelyn and Will build an underground computer kingdom in which he merges machinery and biology and starts to amass a group brain. He contends that hes leading humanity to its next evolutionary leap. Working from a screenplay by Jack Paglen Pfister at first seems playful ironic and totally in control. Unfortunately when Will leaps forward the direction stumbles. Gaps emerge in the narrative. For example RIFTs leader (Kate Mara) declares they must act ""immediately"" to stop Will from infiltrating the entire planet with his coding. Then a title flashes ""Two Years Later"" - and RIFT hasnt done anything yet. The Casters mentor (Morgan Freeman) joins forces with a savvy FBI agent (Cillian Murphy) to keep Will and Evelyn from changing ""life as we know it."" But they dont show up in Brightville until a ""Come to Jesus"" sequence in which Will attracts streams of injured handicapped or diseased innocents who want to throw away their canes hearing aids and dark glasses. A movie that sets out to debate moral quandaries overdoses on shootouts that lack excitement and lucidity. Its high style and best concepts fall to pieces. The promising idea of Will treating Evelyn like a possessive husband stays at a flat nagging level As he keeps showing off his achievements and assigning her chores you can tell shes thinking ""Till death do us part."" Depp gives Hall too little to play off - he has to sacrifice his charisma when he becomes a digital talking head. He must play the second half of his double role so the audience cant be sure whether hes Will or an amazing facsimile. Depp takes a hit for his moviemaking team and blanks himself out. The filmmakers indulge in a trashy form of ambiguity. They depict the computerized Will as a classic mad scientist creating an army of super-strong and ultra-resilient soldiers whose minds bend - literally - to his. Then they undercut the mounting evidence of his craziness in a deflating double whammy of a climax. Its as if Pfister and company think they can sell their movie only if they make Will all things to all people a martyr to technology geeks a monster to Luddites a true (and false) messiah to scientific visionaries. The moviemakers achieve not transcendence but a meltdown.

Starring Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall and Morgan Freeman. (Photo/Video Warner Bros. Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com April 17 2014 146 p.m. ET Wally Pfisters directorial debut ""Transcendence"" is so ambitious visually that its easy at the outset to buy into its sci-fi plot. This is hardly a surprise. For more than a decade Mr. Pfister has been one of the movie mediums pre-eminent cinematographers; hes the man who shot Christopher Nolans ""Batman"" trilogy as well as Mr. Nolans ""Memento"" and ""Inception."" He also proves to be good at directing actors. But oh the woes of the script he has struggled with here. Ambitious to a fault this cautionary fantasy about artificial intelligence has so much on its muddled mind and so little sense of dramatic grounding that it grows ever more preposterous before lurching to a climax thats utterly unfathomable. Related Reading Transcendence From the Camera to the Big Chair The title describes a special case of mind over matter--the total contents of a human brain uploaded to a supercomputer so that the brain transcending its body represents a new kind of mastermind. The cerebral organ a particularly bright one belongs to Will Caster a world authority on artificial intelligence; hes played by Johnny Depp. When Wills research is interrupted by events that youre free to check out in the trailer--why do they have to give so much away?--his smarts converted to a data storm take up residence as qubits in a quantum computer that transcends supercomputing and looks really cool in the bargain. Then the question is whether Will will or wont use his intelligence to benefit mankind. Another question is whether the ghost in the quantum machine is still Will or some malign version of him that is waiting for a chance to get online go viral and infect the world. Disembodied brains as a sci-fi staple range from the shrewdly effective ""Donovans Brain"" to the famously idiotic ""They Saved Hitlers Brain."" Last year Spike Jonze upgraded the genre in his wonderfully poetic ""Her"" with Scarlett Johanssons voice as a superSiri. For a while ""Transcendence"" plays like a high-tech ""Him."" Rebecca Hall is Evelyn Caster Wills wife and research partner whos desperate to save however much of him a computer can store. Since Mr. Pfisters approach is visual Mr. Depp gets to be more than a voice. First Wills face pops up on one screen then another and another in what becomes a briefly comic variation on the theme of the Beatles ""Here There and Everywhere."" But Wills all-pervasive influence is no laughing matter. That is to say he--or more properly it--is deadly serious about taking over the world by moving beyond the bumbling biology of our species even as Jack Paglens script is on the way to being laughable. Plot developments or grandiose notions include the construction in a remote desert town called Brightwood of an underground data center approximately the size of the Manhattan Project (no one seems to notice until its almost finished); the appropriation of such Judeo-Christian themes as healing the blind and making the desert bloom and the emergence of hybrid creatures that look like human beings except that they are networked in a way that recalls ""Village of the Damned"" or ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" Here and there though far from everywhere striking images relieve the narrative foolishness Brightwoods faded walls and moldering buildings the bedazzling panels of a solar farm a dewdrop shifting shape as it falls in super-slow motion Jess Hall was the cinematographer. And Rebecca Hall is affecting within the limits of her role. Evelyn is the films only interesting character yet she remains as written essentially two-dimensional. (At least that trumps the no-dimensionality of Mr. Depps role.) The cast includes Paul Bettany Cillian Murphy and Morgan Freeman but actors cant save the film from itself. Neither can a last-ditch effort--by the studio? by the filmmakers?--to turn ""Transcendence"" into an upbeat fable. When that climax comes and the last vestiges of coherence vanish all you want to do is upload yourself out of the theater and give your own brain a rest. Watch a clip from the documentary film ""Watermark."" Directed by Jennifer Baichwal and Edward Burtynsky. (Photo Edward Burtynsky) Watermark Southern California where I live is in the grip of an epic drought. That makes me all the more receptive to this extraordinary documentary about water but Ive admired the special vision of the filmmakers ever since I saw their landmark ""Manufactured Landscapes"" almost a decade ago. The earlier film which followed the work of the Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky was directed by Jennifer Baichwal and used a tour of industrial Asia to show without polemics the scale of mans activities and their impact on the planet. The new one with Ms. Baichwal and Mr. Burtynsky sharing directorial credit illustrates once again without polemics the primacy of water in our lives--how as Mr. Burtynsky puts it water shapes us and how we shape water. Heres a case of images in the service of important ideas rather than entertainment yet they could hardly be more powerful from roaring torrents released by a dam in China to a lyrical helicopter shot of a glistening river in British Columbia. The emphasis is inevitably on the need for conservation and some of the images are predictably dismaying parched soil where the Colorado River once coursed through Mexico; a river in Bangladesh awash with toxic chemicals from a local tannery. Other sequences would seem to be studies in agricultural and aquacultural bounty--Californias Imperial Valley surrounded by desert; irrigated farmlands of the Great Plains that sit on the Ogallala Aquifer. But the bounty may be doomed for the water that feeds it is being drawn down faster than it can be replaced. At a vast agglomeration of floating abalone farms off Chinas Fujian coast a fisherman tries to be philosophical about declining production ""Nothing lasts forever."" Nothing does but thats no reason for inaction and ""Watermark"" takes note of action on a heroic scale--most notably in a sequence devoted to the construction of Chinas Xiluodu dam which is six times the size of the Hoover. Here as in ""Manufactured Landscapes"" the greatest gift the images confer is a sense of scale--of that enterprise in particular; of the human enterprise in general; of the struggle for and with water ever since living creatures first ventured out of the sea. Watch a clip from the film ""Fading Gigolo."" Starring John Turturro Woody Allen Sharon Stone and Sofia Vergara. (Photo/Video Millennium Entertainment) Fading Gigolo The best thing to be said for this lumbering comedy is that it offers a chance to see Vanessa Paradis the singularly alluring French singer actress and model play Avigal a melancholy Hasidic widow in Brooklyn N.Y. and play the role with exceptional delicacy. Otherwise arrgh John Turturros fifth feature as writer-director turns dross to dreck as it tracks the amorous exploits of its hero a Candide pressed into service as Casanova. The title alone should be enough to wave you off but its no more off-putting than the premise which has the added distinctions of being arbitrary and absurd. Mr. Turturros Fioravante a decent man with a negligible job at a florists is depressed and at a loss for his next step in life until his old friend Murray suggests he become a gigolo. It seems that Murrays dermatologist a beautiful woman played by Sharon Stone has been looking together with an equally beautiful woman friend for a man who can fill out a menage a trois. You should also know that Murray a failed bookseller eager to reinvent himself as a pimp is played by Woody Allen who gives a hand-flapping self-parodying performance that I can only describe as appalling. ENLARGE John Turturro and Sofia Vergara in Fading Gigolo Millennium Entertainment ""Fading Gigolo"" is almost retrograde enough to be daring but the pace is tentative the comedy is dull and the Hasidic sequences are burdened by Liev Schreibers scowlingly leaden performance as a patrolman in a neighborhood watch. Yet the crucial miscalculation concerns the title character. Fioravantes unexpected success in his new career flows from his sensitivity or so we are asked to believe rather than his sexual virtuosity; women like him so he learns to like himself. Still the role Mr. Turturro has given himself is written so sketchily and played so blandly that Fioravante remains a wistful cipher. ""You bring magic to the lonely"" Avigal tells him but thats not true. What little magic the film can muster comes from the lonely widow whose burgeoning spirit combined with restraint turns out to be genuinely touching. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE ""The Man With Two Brains"" (1983) If theres a more sublimely silly movie out there I dont know about it. Steve Martin under Carl Reiners direction plays Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr a neurosurgeon who travels with a bell jar containing the living brain of his beloved. Mr. Martin has often been sublimely silly. Im thinking of such scenes as his daft weather forecasts in ""L.A. Story"" and his wild gyrations in ""All of Me"" after Lily Tomlins spirit invades his body. But nothing tops the moment in this one when he takes an acrobatic sobriety test on a German autobahn. ENLARGE ""Please Give"" (2010) Rebecca Hall has a relatively small role in Nicole Holofceners lovely flawless comedy. Catherine Keener plays the main character Kate a Manhattan wife and mother with an excess of empathy. But Ms. Hall distinguishes herself as Rebecca a young medical technician who administers mammograms. Rebecca is kind to everyone but herself; if only she could X-ray her own soul to see how good she is. Its hard to overstate how good Ms. Hall is in the role and hard to believe that shes the same actress who played David Frosts sleekly sophisticated girlfriend in ""Frost/Nixon."" ENLARGE ""The Girl on the Bridge"" (1999) Vanessa Paradis is Adele a beautiful human target for Daniel Auteils knife thrower Gabor in this French-language fairy tale with an erotic charge. Gabor looks to be far beyond his prime but hes so good and so eerily confident that Adele has boundless faith in his skill. Little does she know that it isnt skill as much as his belief in her own ability to bring him magical good luck at a time in his life when he desperately needs it. The film was directed by Patrice Leconte and shot by Jean-Marie Dreujou in dazzling wide-screen black-and-white.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 155 p.m. EDT April 18 2014Johnny Depp stars as a doctor who blurs the line between man and machine in the new thriller Transcendence.(Photo Peter Mountain Warner Bros. Pictures)Though it purports to question our reliance on technology and incite some rage against the machine Transcendence is really just a heavy-handed story of a mad scientist.And its not a particularly effective cautionary tale (  out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide). While the first 20 minutes convey an eerie tension the story soon devolves into a far-fetched futuristic snooze-fest that often defies its own logic. Characters motivations are rarely clear and allegiances shift with no explanation.The film opens in the not-too-distant future when the technological slate has been wiped clean. Wi-Fi has fallen by the wayside and the Web is blacked out. Its a good start. But the eerie mood is quickly displaced by unconvincing performances and strained dialogue.Johnny Depp plays Dr. Will Caster the pre-eminent researcher in artificial intelligence. He and his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) are working on creating a hybrid human a sentient machine that will contain all the collective knowledge of every person who ever existed along with personality and emotions. Understandably the research is controversial. A growing cadre of hilariously labeled ""radical neo-Luddites"" has made him Public Enemy No.1 as it pulls off a series of terror attacks.STORY Johnny Depp Wally Pfister go old-school on new techMORE Tech-savvy stars of Transcendence are tech-wary tooREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersWhile Transcendences premise is provocative the way the story plays out is over the top and half-baked.Hellbent on destroying the man and his work terrorists from RIFT (Revolutionary Independence From Technology) shoot Will with a radiation-laced bullet mortally wounding him. Will may be brilliant but hes oddly blithe about the ethical considerations of digitally re-creating humans. For Evelyn who is purportedly more concerned with helping humanity the issue is murkier. But that doesnt stop her and colleague Max Walters (Paul Bettany) from recording Wills brain patterns and uploading them into a supercomputer essentially reviving his ideas and feelings in a dramatic mind meld just as Will shuffles off this mortal coil.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare In Transcendence Johnny Depp plays a brilliant scientist whose mind is allowed to live on and evolve through artificial intelligence after his body is attacked. VPCBut is the computerized result actually Will? For Evelyn it hardly matters Shes so in love that any tenuous link sustains her.Apparently Wills ultra-evolved consciousness has been blinded by science. His thirst for knowledge becomes an unquenchable need for power. He begins amassing an army of human/machine hybrids and inexplicably develops superpowers.The specifics of the digitized nonsense are delivered in the disembodied voice and computerized likeness of Depp emanating from beyond the grave and via the cloud.Ordinarily a gifted actor who fully invests himself in diverse roles Depp is uncharacteristically listless as if he realized too late that what hed signed on to was hardly worth the effort.Hall plays her part as the concerned wife with only a jot more liveliness. Morgan Freeman as scientist Joseph Tagger pops in sporadically to speak wisdom. The least riveting characters are the interchangeable technophobic rebels.In an unlikely move government law enforcement (in the person of Cillian Murphy) joins forces with rebel fighters to take down Will. Apparently in this dire scenario the government does negotiate with terrorists.Directed by Wally Pfister the cinematographer for Inception Transcendence seeks to be as mind-blowing but its nowhere near as captivating as that intricate thriller.Last years Her -- the story of a man who falls in love with an operating system -- raised more intriguing questions about technology. And it did it with more imagination and feeling than this muddled clash between man and machines. 65 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/Qhxx8d",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/04/17/transcendence-review/6891875/,200,transcendence26,transcendence,usatoday

Pictures release. Photo Credit AP / Peter Mountain advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A dying artificial intelligence expert uploads his consciousness into a computer. Rated PG-13 (sci-fi action and violence some bloody images brief strong language and sensuality) BOTTOM LINE The years first bona fide stinker is an implausible and outdated sci-fi film full of pseudoscience and ancient Windows terminology. Depps performance could fairly be called ""virtual."" CAST Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall Paul Bettany LENGTH 159 Last year Spike Jonzes ""Her"" envisioned a time when men and computers might fall in love. This wasnt a horror story but a romance and it broke centuries of science-fiction tradition in which technology is always a fearsome dehumanizing force. With ""Her"" the genre seemed to finally exit the anxious 1950s and enter the 21st century. But here comes ""Transcendence"" which drags science fiction back to the Cold War era if not the Stone Age. Its the story of an artificial-intelligence expert Will Caster who cheats death by uploading his brain onto a giant server -- ""like a song or a movie"" says his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall). Actually more like the Heartbleed bug. Will played by a half-there Johnny Depp (mostly as a televised image) quickly hops onto the Internet and begins controlling Wall Street human beings and our entire ecosystem. He exists literally in the cloud. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""Transcendence"" quivers with so many fears (some valid most preposterous) that it ends up feeling both paralyzed and hysterical. Its worried about ""the grid"" but also about neo-Luddite terrorist groups like RIFT (Revolutionary Independence From Technology). The movie is afraid of computers that speak in icy voices like HAL of diseases in the form of source-code ""cells"" and that old bogeyman communism here represented by an army of soulless brainless Bluetooth-controlled humans. Cobbled together by first-time director Wally Pfister (the Oscar-winning cinematographer of ""Inception"") from Jack Paglens incoherent screenplay ""Transcendence"" makes no sense even by its own implausible logic. To distract us there are a half-dozen stock characters including Paul Bettany as Wills concerned friend Max Kate Mara as a punkish rebel Cillian Murphy as an FBI agent and Morgan Freeman as the vaguely titled Dr. Tagger. The dialogue is packed with whats meant to be dazzling techno jargon but it ranges from antiquated (""Y2K"") to campy (""Hes fragmented Im gonna run a diagnostic""). Nothing in this movie feels authentic not even its overriding fear of all science and technology which seems copied from countless old sci-fi films. ""Transcendence"" is like a reformatted Gateway PC It doesnt have a thought in its head. 234 EntertainmentTranscendence trailer PLOT A dying artificial intelligence expert uploads his consciousness into a computer. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (sci-fi action and violence some bloody images brief strong language and sensuality) CAST Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall Paul Bettany LENGTH 159 BOTTOM LINE The years first bona fide stinker is an implausible and outdated sci-fi film full of pseudoscience and ancient Windows terminology.

Transcendence (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Transcendence (PG-13) A preposterous sci-fi thriller starring Johnny Depp. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/17/2014 Editor rating 1 Transcendence is Her for dummies a romance between a woman and a machine for people who care more about technology pixels and special effects than the things in life that matter. The movie marks the debut of cinematographer Wally Pfister a frequent Christopher Nolan collaborator and you can picture him sitting at home at Oscar night shaking his fists and yelling at the TV when Spike Jonze won the Best Original Screenplay award for Her. Judging by the size and scope of the movie Pfister probably started working on his film first. But there are too many similarities not to compare the two pictures and there isnt a single instance in which Pfister comes out on top aside from the number of shots of Johnny Depp speaking into a futuristic Skype camera. Why pay the notoriously costly actor his typically enormous salary when hes barely in the movie? That could be Max Headroom macking on Katherine Heigl or Jennifer Aniston up there and you wouldnt notice the difference. The premise of Transcendence which was written by Jack Paglen (who should invest his paycheck wisely) follows what happens when the terminally ill Depp comes up with a groundbreaking idea to plug himself into a mammoth computer -- an enormous sentient machine with advanced artificial intelligence -- and see if he can continue to live virtually when his body dies on him. His wife and loyal partner (Rebecca Hall) goes along with the plan if only for the possibility of not losing her husband. As FBI/NSA agents Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy see nothing wrong with this idea even if Depp would gain instant control of every computer and smart device on the planet if he succeeds. Hey whats a little God complex among between friends right? Only two people in the movie seem to have any common sense at all Paul Bettany as another of Depps fellow scientists who isnt too sure this whole lets-give-this-guy-control-of-the-planet enterprise is a good idea and Kate Mara (as driven here as she is on House of Cards) who is part of a terrorist organization plotting to pull the plug on this bunch of not-so-bright brainiacs. Transcendence is filled with preposterous you-gotta-be-kidding-me story elements you cant stop to think about or else youll start craving a trip to the concession stand -- anything to stave off the boredom. Wouldnt the government which has drones in outer space that can give you a ticket for running a red light notice a gigantic solar-powered laboratory the size of a university that pops up in a dusty town overnight like a weed? As Depps powers grow his performance becomes more and more HAL-like (HAL remains the grandmaster of evil machines) and after he starts seizing physical control of people and giving them super-strength I kept waiting for him to break out with a Dr. Evil laugh. For all its improbabilities Her explored the intricacies of romantic relationships and how much they hurt when they end while giving you plenty of neat eye-candy. Transcendence is a movie that aside from a few scenes where hes walking around in a suit Depp could have shot in his living room while instant-messaging his agent about the next Pirates of the Caribbean movie. That prospect torturous as it sounds is a better alternative than this.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it In his onscreen digital manifestation Will Caster (Johnny Depp) grows difficult to deal with for his mentor Joseph Tagger (Morgan Freeman) left Agent Buchanan (Cillian Murphy) and Casters wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) in ""Transcendence."" (Peter Mountain) By Michael OSullivan April 17 2014 The dystopian future envisioned by last years critical darling ""Her"" reappears in ""Transcendence"" albeit with a lot more testosterone. You could even call this new thriller -- in which a godlike artificial intelligence played by Johnny Depp starts building an army of cyborg zombies -- ""Him."" Unlike that earlier film about a man who falls in love with a computer operating system which was a poetic melancholic meditation on the failure to connect ""Transcendence"" is a kind of high-tech horror story. In this case the bogeyman is the Internet. The extent to which it succeeds in frightening depends on your philosophical alignment with say Ted Kaczynski. People living in cabins without running water or WiFi in other words will probably love it because it confirms their deepest darkest fears. All others proceed with caution. The story gets underway when Will Caster (Depp) a scientist specializing in artificial intelligence narrowly survives a shooting by a member of a radical anti-technology group. When it becomes clear that Will has been poisoned by a polonium-tipped bullet his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and his best friend Max (Paul Bettany) hit upon the idea of uploading Wills fading consciousness to a supercomputer. Johnny Depp attends the premiere of ""Transcendence"" in Los Angeles. Depp plays a scientist at odds with an anti-technology terrorist group. (Reuters) Will who is now merely a collection of ones and zeros decides to surf the Web vacuuming up all human knowledge and power -- including WebMD cat videos and access to the global financial system -- into his electronic brain. In short order he has morphed from a mild-mannered computer nerd into a sexier version of Oz the Great and Powerful reigning via video screen over a fortified bunker in the desert where his arms and legs have been replaced by a cadre of humanoid automatons created through robotic nanosurgery in his futuristic subterranean lab. And how exactly is all of this accomplished? Considering that the setting of the film is the present day -- based on the look of the cars people are driving -- its a mystery. A perfunctory shot of a dying Will reciting in alphabetical order the contents of the Oxford English Dictionary while his bald head is hooked up to electrodes is meant to aid in our willing suspension of disbelief. Any other questions? Look people weve got a movie to get through here. Directed by cinematographer-turned-filmmaker Wally Pfister from a script by first-timer Jack Paglen ""Transcendence"" wastes no time with such details as logic or credibility. Its the kind of movie in which people shout stuff like ""The incoming queries have all been anonymized"" -- hoping presumably that most people will be so surprised to learn that ""anonymize"" is a word that they wont stop to wonder what that sentence means. Never mind that artificial intelligence of this level by even the most optimistic estimates is still decades away. The concept of a mighty cyber-brain being able to transcend our puny human ones -- what some futurists call the ""singularity"" -- isnt due before 2045 at the earliest according to many prognosticators. The problem with ""Transcendence"" isnt that its an utter crock. At times the tale like ""Her"" betrays flashes of genuine insight into our love-hate relationship with technology. And the acting while wooden on the part of Depp -- who appears throughout most of the film on a monitor like a high-def Max Headroom -- is decent enough. Even the love story sort of works in the way that Evelyns yearning for Will blinds her to the fact that the ""Will"" on screen who isnt above embezzling other peoples money to finance the construction of his lair isnt remotely like the man she married. Shes no different from a widow who saves her late husbands voicemails so that she can still listen to him. Thats touching even if her husbands pillow talk these days consists of statements like ""The balance of oxytocin and serotonin in your system is unusual."" No the real trouble with ""Transcendence"" is that it just isnt all that scary -- at least not in the way that it wants to be. The movie opens with a prologue set five years in the future in which there is no more Internet no more Facebook no more Google. This post-apocalyptic vision of an unplugged tomorrow is supposed to be horrifying but in truth the thought of a world that has hit the restart button however reluctantly is actually kind of refreshing.  1/2 PG-13.

But as any geek could tell you Johnny Depp is no Scarlett Johansson.Depp is low-key and bespectacled as Will a Bay Area expert in artificial intelligence. While his mentor Joe (Morgan Freeman) works for the government Will is a purist who does not want to militarize or profit from AI research. But Wills wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) encourages him to change the world for the better. When Will describes his brave new world at a think-tank conference a protester accuses him of playing God (a common refrain in bad sci-fi movies). Soon neo-Luddite protesters launch attacks against all the prominent AI labs in the country.Although Will survives he is gravely wounded and not expected to recover. Over the objections of colleague Max (Paul Bettany) Evelyn uploads Wills consciousness into a ""physically independent neural network."" Soon after Will dies their labs computer screens spring to life with his face and voice.But this is not a slavish Siri. As Max ominously notes intelligence needs to grow and as the anti-tech radicals learn about OS Will Evelyn and her cyber-husband escape to the desert. In a sun-baked speck of a town they build a command center for a benevolent bio-mechanical makeover of the entire human species. What could possibly go wrong?The film was produced by Christopher Nolan as an evident favor to his longtime cinematographer Wally Pfister who makes an eye-centric debut as a director here. But we suspect the screenplay was written by robots and not the unknown ""Jack Paglen"" in the credits. The Script-o-Matic 3000 cant compute humor or tolerate the tics of unpredictable people. And apparently it couldnt hear the ear-offending frequency of lines like ""Oh my god hes re-ordering his own code"" The goofiest glitch is when a female tries to ""upload a virus"" into Will who conveniently resumes his human form for the bedroom moment.""Transcendence"" is an ambitious movie but ultimately theres too much ""artificial"" and not enough ""intelligence.""What ""Transcendence""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 155  Content Sci-fi action and violence some bloody images brief strong language and sensuality Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

"Transcendence movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Transcendence  Video Transcendence muddled in its direction Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews Johnny Depps latest ""Transcendence."" Also Michaels picks for whats new to see in town. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews Johnny Depps latest ""Transcendence."" Also Michaels picks for whats new to see in town. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune After an intriguing start ""Transcendence"" -- aka ""The Computer Wore Johnny Depps Tennis Shoes"" -- offers roughly the same level of excitement as listening to hold music during a call to tech support.You can feel the audience hanging in there for a while as first-time feature director Wally Pfister working from a script by first-time writer Jack Paglen sets up the films artificial intelligence premise. The prologue takes place five years in the future and reveals a city (Berkeley Calif.) bereft of electricity and pass codes and any sort of online activity. Everyones biking everywhere through apparent ruins and although its supposed to look menacing and dystopian I thought it seemed nice and quiet. Like much speculative fiction ""Transcendence"" is in thrall to the notion of revolutionary technology even as it warns of the energy demands of unleashed unchained AI especially as applied to the face voice and aura of a bona fide movie star. Depp who essentially Skypes in his performance plays Dr. Will Caster. He and his researcher wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) have pioneered AI experiments inching the human race ever-closer to ""transcendence"" the ability to imbue a fantastically powerful computer with the personality memories and foibles of a human being.Then anti-tech terrorists launch a series of attacks and Dr. Caster is critically injured in an assassination attempt. At deaths door he enlists Evelyn and a fellow AI whiz (Paul Bettany) to digitize the good doctors big brain thereby ""saving"" the best of the dying man and allowing him to live on in the form of a machine all-knowing all-seeing thirsty for knowledge and with the attractive implacable face of Johnny Depp. Much of the film takes place in the computer-doctors desert lair where Caster and company build a team of ""hybrids"" (superhuman humans with impressive gas mileage) much to the chagrin of the FBI and other authority figures. Cillian Murphy has virtually nothing of interest to do as the federal agent looking worried alongside Morgan Freemans wise owl of a computer expert who knows the Casters are going too far once they get around to reordering Earths organic matter.In story terms ""Transcendence"" struggles to make the human square-offs and factions interesting. In visual terms director Pfister a longtime cinematographer of tremendous skill has a few things to learn. Compared to many other effects-dependent pictures lately this ones on the easygoing (if not plodding) side. Now and then theres a quick sharp image that works such as the initial computer-screen indication -- ""Is anybody there?"" Caster types from the other side -- the audience sees but the Hall and Bettany characters do not. Too often the actors mill around waiting for some momentum to build or for some visual dynamism to emerge in the staging of the copious and awkward dialogue.Spike Jonzes great 2013 film ""Her"" dealt with many of the what-ifs ""Transcendence"" explores tentatively. For most of the films increasingly listless second half were stuck watching a vaguely bored Depp his face floating Wizard of Oz-like on the nearest monitor dutifully pulling the strings on a scenario allowing for anything and everything to happen. The doctors super-duper-AI abilities allow him to heal the halt the lame and the blind even. But is this progress? The movies a cyber-""Frankenstein"" with Depp as both the visionary mad scientist and the experiment. It has everything except a sense of urgency and visual magic. And those are two pretty big things.mjphillipstribune.com ""Transcendence"" - 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sci-fi action and violence some bloody images brief strong language and sensuality)Running time 159Opens 8 p.m. Thursday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Reviews Johnny Depp Science Rebecca Hall Paul Bettany Transcendence Latest movie reviews Review The Railway Man  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising77deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-transcendence-review-20140416,0,5993865.column",200,transcendence32,transcendence,chicagotribune

If youre his/its wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) you might be touched -- at least literally. Anyone else among the characters or the audience of Transcendence is likely to be pretty seriously creeped out. A love story between a human and a computer we got one for Christmas and it was called Her. Joaquin Phoenix fell hard for the voice of Scarlett Johansson -- who wouldnt? But in Transcendence the provocative but ponderous science-fiction thriller written by Jack Paglem and directed by Wally Pfister the dating game is an endgame. Will a leading light in the study of artificial intelligence and Evelyn his devoted research assistant are bound in love and work. To keep her love alive she will enable his existence as a sentient being whose implications she may not have quite thought through. (READ Corlisss review of Spike Jonzes Her) Smart machines that may serve or dominate mankind are as old as Samuel Butlers 1872 novel Erewhon and Karel Capeks 1920 play R.U.R. and as recent as this weeks episode of The Simpsons in which Dr. Frink revives the dead Homer as a chatty screen saver. Next year Marvels Avengers will reunite to battle a brilliant computer (and Oedipal wreck) in Age of Ultron. AI parables usually assume a Doomsday tone preaching fear of the devices that keep the modern world running -- including the computers whose magic makes todays action-movie effects so very effective. A movie like Transcendence may be pertinent in its political reverberations of all computer data held in a cloud and monitored by the NSA but it also rails against the tools its makers so artfully employ. Just dont tell the techies who masterminded the cool CGI stuff. In the not too distant future the world is without the Internet. Streetlights dont work; a cell phone is discarded; a computer keyboard is used for a doorstop. Flash back to five years earlier when Will and his friend and colleague Max Waters (Paul Bettany) speak at a Silicon Valley conference. Max hopes to cure cancer and Alzheimers but Will wants to create an AI greater than the combined brainpower of all humans who have ever lived on Earth. He has devised a Physically Independent Neural Network (PINN) that could build on the work of another scientist who has managed to upload the brain of a rhesus monkey. Will PINN be the next step in technological and possibly human evolution? (SEE Top 10 Japanese Robots) That notion is toxic to blond Bree (Kate Mara) and her cohorts in a radical back-to-basics group called RIFT (Revolutionary Independence From Technology). Theyre sort of the 21st century Amish except that in a 9/11-ish neo-Luddite attack they kill computer programmers with exploding slices of birthday cake. One of the RIFTers shoots Will with a bullet that gives him radiation poisoning. Weeks away from certain death he determines to upload his intelligence his very soul and essence into a computer. When he dies a half hour into the movie Evelyn and Max unplug PINN and -- in a lovely little frisson -- the last thing we see among the tumult of digits on the computer screen is the blink of a message ""ANYONE THERE?"" With some misgivings but much love Evelyn keeps the system functioning and growing. Under cyber-Wills instructions she buys up a desolate depressed town called Brightwood and builds an enormous facility whose screens show Wills omniscient visage and whose machines can perform miracle surgery like giving sight to a man blind from birth. Crystalline particles rise from the ground and catch the wind (as in the 1956 sci-fi essential Invasion of the Body Snatchers) to spread the new gospel across the earth. Is this a Good Word or a triumph of Will? (FIND Invasion of the Body Snatchers among TIMEs Top 10 Sci-Fi Movies of the 1950s) Like Gods Not Dead the fundamentalist Christian movie that has become a popular hit Transcendence is essentially a dramatized debate. And as Gods Not Dead stacks the rhetorical cards for the Deitys existence the Pfister film eventually hangs back with the Luddites. The man who will soon shoot Will asks him if by advancing artificial intelligence hes not creating a God and Will wryly replies ""Isnt that what man has always done?"" Thats just what Will the ghost in the computer has in mind. When a posse led by old friend Joseph Tagger (Morgan Freeman who has also played God a few times) and FBI agent Buchanan (Cillian Murphy) confronts Will in Brightwood he tells Evelyn ""Were not going to fight them. Were going to transcend them."" He means subdue and inhabit them engulf and devour. The two lead actors have occupied similar roles before. Depp has played many an antic genius and he slipped inside the body of an Old West chameleon in Rango. In Iron Man 3 Hall was the biologist who helps deranged scientist Guy Pearce create Extremis a computer program that can ""hack into the hard drive of any living organism"" and overtake its DNA. In Transcendence she represents the core emotion of a woman who wants to hold on to her man even as his wits may be festering in a case of Alzheimers with a capacity for mischief on a global scale. Thats poignant but Hall gets to express these feelings only with a mopey mouth-agape unease. And Depp who has gone studiously sometimes entertainingly bananas in the Pirates movies and his Tim Burton collaborations is subdued to the point of entropy. If he cant overplay he doesnt play at all. (READ Corlisss review of Iron Man 3) Pfister served as Christopher Nolans cinematographer on five films including The Dark Knight and Inception. Borrowing many of Nolans favorite actors Pfister also co-opts some of Nolans weighty themes -- of technologys gifts and curses and questing intellect run rampant. But clever ideas early on go rogue or go missing in the gallop toward an action-film climax that then perversely doesnt materialize. The movies intelligence is artificial its affect solemn. (READ The meta-musings of Inception) Its been said theres one way to tell if a computer is human ask it to crack a joke and see if it can understand irony. This computer movie does neither. Bursting with unrealized potential Transcendence ends up as a trance dance. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Smartphones lightning-fast Internet and nanotechnology connect Transcendence to the here and now. But in plenty of other respects this humorless science-fiction cautionary tale feels like a relic from an earlier era pulled out of a dusty old box of zip disks and 56k modems. Forget that the basic plot about a dying researcher whose consciousness is uploaded into a computer bears a certain resemblance to the 1992 techno-thriller The Lawnmower Man. Theres also something very turn-of-the-millennium about its dread. Fear of artificial intelligence interconnectivity and the vast accumulation of data hasnt exactly died down but Transcendence approaches those anxieties with the stop-the-presses urgency of a Y2K alarmist. The film rages dully and impotently against a future that has more or less already arrived. Speaking of Y2K a post-apocalyptic prologue offers the realization of that passe doomsday scenario Shopkeepers scrawl prices in marker and prop their doors open with keyboards while narrator Max Waters (Paul Bettany) speculates about the possibility of electricity in Boston. (As visions of a technology-free world go its less Mad Max than that one episode of South Park.) Flashing back five years Transcendence finds leading A.I. scientist Will Caster (Johnny Depp) shot down by an anti-technology extremist group; in true comic-book fashion these unlikely terrorists lace the fired bullet with radiation leaving their genius target on his deathbed. Wracked with grief Wills wife and research partner Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) converts her hubbys mind into ones and zeroes. He awakens as a digital demigod his face a pixelated avatar his voice an electronic sample and his brain a mighty hard drive sucking up global intel at an alarming rate. Meanwhile fellow researcher Waters falls under the influence of the resistance--specifically Kate Maras ranting radical who possesses all the indignation of a self-righteous grad student. Transcendence powers forward with an almost mechanized efficiency sacrificing such niceties as drama comedy and character development in the pursuit of its dystopian endgame. The supporting actors--Morgan Freeman as a colleague Cillian Murphy as an FBI agent--arent so much playing people as mouthpieces on hand to speculate about the dangers of combining a mans lust for power with a machines processing power. Will whos like Dr. Manhattan by way of Max Headroom eventually constructs a kind of high-tech corporate campus on the grounds of a Southwest desert town possibly because situating it within a city would be more expensive for the filmmakers. Here he makes great strides in the field of nanotechnology harnessing Biblical swarms of microscopic computers to cure disease and regenerate cells but also to transform civilians into T-1000-like soldier-slaves. How could nanotech afford a person superhuman speed and strength? The logic is as shaky as the philosophy which hinges on a general distrust of technological progress. Eventually perhaps inevitably Transcendence erupts into armed conflict orchestrated by first-time director Wally Pfister with a general lack of panache. Pfister is probably best known as Christopher Nolans director of photography and while he has his collaborators ultra-seriousness down pat he lacks Nolans talent for weaving grand pop spectacle out of cultural anxieties. (One ironic demerit The cinematography by Hot Fuzzs Jess Hall is no match for what Pfister himself could have provided the project.) Truthfully though the movies problems run deeper than its execution of action. The tortured relationship between Will and Evelyn the latter of whom desperately wants to believe that her beloved still exists in the code is meant to be the heart of the picture. But try as she might Hall cant sell the romance--possibly because her co-lead Skyping it in seems no more alive before his conversion than after. Outdated outrage aside Transcendence finally fails because theres no ghost in its machine. For a film about the erosion of humanity by technology its surprisingly lacking in... humanity.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 16 2014 at 1122 PM updated April 16 2014 at 1133 PM comments Its called ""Transcendence"" but it never achieves it. Instead Johnny Depps new cyber sci-fi picture remains dully literal and strictly earthbound a movie about big ideas that sadly has few original ones of its own. Thats a shame because its the directorial debut of Wally Pfister the cinematographer whos given Chris Nolans films their consistently rich deeply focused look (and who won an Oscar for the dizzyingly layered ""Inception""). But a cinematographer is not necessarily a director let alone a storyteller and the screenplay for ""Transcendence"" -- another debut effort this one from writer Jack Paglen -- gives Pfister little to work with. The story features a listless Johnny Depp -- trotting out that vaguely posh ""Continental"" accent he puts on when he wants to sound thoughtful -- as a brilliant researcher in artificial-intelligence. One day he predicts man and machine may even combine to form some new sort of godly omniscient creature. But then cruel fate takes a hand -- and it becomes clear to Depp and wife Rebecca Hall that the time for mind-melding is now. What happens next? Oh you know what happens next -- at least if you grew up on old-school sci-fi like ""2001"" and ""Colossus The Forbin Project."" Cyber-Depp gets more powerful and more arrogant quickly amassing money then power then an army. Its all pretty predictable and Pfister and his cast never do anything to confound our assumptions. Depp literally phones in or rather Skypes in his performance (most of his dull work is delivered via video screen) and the fine Rebecca Hall is stuck looking endlessly concerned. Add in Morgan Freeman as his usual Voice Of Wisdom a gang of cyberterrorists led by the raccoon-eyed Kate Mara and the sort of massive underground lair that would strain credulity in a mid-60s Bond film and you have a movie thats really just a cut-and-paste job. Its a shame because -- not surprisingly -- Pfister shows a real control of imagery here. Hes particularly fond of building suspense through excruciatingly slow pans and emphasizing the chilliness of technology with white-on-white set design. But unlike the truly mind-bending ""Inception"" ""Transcendence"" never grapples with the concepts it introduces sticking to an absolute-genius-corrupts-absolutely plot that was old back in the first season of ""Star Trek"" and ending with a muffled whimper. Its not that there isnt a lot of talking -- a lot -- about artificial intelligence here. But real intelligence? Thats in sadly short supply. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Transcendence (PG-13) Warner Bros. (119 min.) Directed by Wally Pfister. With Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall Morgan Freeman.

"Review Transcendence doesnt entirely compute but Johnny Depp is good - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Transcendence doesnt entirely compute but Johnny Depp is goodBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 04/16/2014 020000 PM PDTUpdated 04/18/2014 091652 PM PDT At long last Johnny Depp returns to a role that forces him to act not just ham it up. That departure is one of the most appealing aspects of the muddled but well-intended sci-fi mind-tripper ""Transcendence."" Other minor incidentals such as how the film opens in whats described as an Internet-deprived Berkeley of the near future and later references Lawrence Livermore Lab give it Bay Area relevance.Beyond that provincialism and the snazzy visuals and relevant premise this cautionary man vs. computer tale from first-time director Wally Pfister is a bit of a slog interesting in patches but boring in stretches. And while its discussions about supercomputers transcendence and god complexes send red flags flying about the near future the storys mainframe is faultily wired and in need of repair.""Transcendence"" wrestles with a cutting-edge theme -- mans escalating pursuit of a mega-computer that will harness all collective intelligence and possess a soul -- but it offers no startling insights about the ""Frankenstein"" possibilities that premise raises. Literally theres more talk than action and that along with underdeveloped elements in Jack Paglens screenplay drag it down.Depp plays the brilliant -- we know he is because we keep hearing him referred to as such -- Dr. Will Caster a research scientist who specializes in artificial intelligence. Looking disheveled in that sexy Depp way the actor smartly makes Will who becomes a target of violent anti-tech zealots both eccentric and enigmatic. That benefits the narratives progression as Wills intentions become more circumspect once his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) decides along with their friend Max Winters (Paul Bettany) to essentially download -- or would that be upload? -- him to a sentient computer Will created named PINN or Physically Independent Neural Network.Advertisement Is Evelyn played with passionate conviction by Hall venturing into dangerous territory to make the world a better place? Or is she so blinded by grief that she cant let go of Will? And is that really Will popping up on-screen?Naturally revealing too much spoils the fun. But the real disappointment is how the screenplay shortchanges certain key characters. Case in point Anti-tech ringleader Bree (Kate Mara of ""House of Cards"") is given minimal dialogue even though shes essential to the plot. Simply putting a blonde wig on Mara and having her chat for a bit at a bar doesnt expand on what the RIFT (Revolutionary Independence From Technology) group is really all about. Joseph Tagger a friend of the Casters and a computer expert is treated with the same lack of depth. We never get a reasonable gauge on who he is but since hes played by Morgan Freeman he commands more respect than the role deserves.That ""Transcendence"" spends more time talking about computers than creating live human characters is even more problematic because the romance between Will and Evelyn is so key to what happens. Pfister and Paglen give us satisfying hints of their love at the start but more is needed. On the upside Pfister has crafted a subtle and convincing not-so-distant future and once again this Oscar-winning cinematographer of ""Inception"" hits the highest of visual notes. But when it comes to modern techie anxiety and love connections Spike Jonzes ""Her"" juggled the topic with more dexterity. True ""Transcendence"" has a different approach and thematic goals. But which of the two films results in the conversation starter it so strives to be? Hands down it would be ""Her."" And you dont need a supercomputer to figure that one out.TRanscendence   Rating PG-13 (sci-fi action and violence bloody images brief strong language sensuality) Cast Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall Paul Bettany Morgan Freeman Kate MaraDirector Wally PfisterRunning time 1 hour 59 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the last; Deadwood movie still on trackReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Transcendence isnt going to win any comparisons with last years Her (a pocket version of the same general concept) and you wonder why Depp signed on to the staid role of Will Caster a Berkeley genius whose Einstein-shaggy hairdo would suggest someone dottier. Before Will is critically wounded in an act of anticomputer terrorism the film introduces some warmly geeky characters all on a first-name basis Evelyn (Rebecca Hall the fluttering heart of the film) is Wills fund-raiser researcher and wife; Max (Paul Bettany) is their brilliant best friend; and Joseph (Morgan Freeman) is a government-supported scientist who smells something bad in the air. The human element--including much of the audiences interest--is largely jettisoned though after Wills brain gets wired to the Web hes reborn as a mildly annoying overlord and husband and microscopic nanobots begin to swarm into unsuspecting bodies. While Transcendence has tons of money to spend on unpersuasive digital effects and dronelike music it shows little interest in exploring the potentially tricky benefits of a computer-enhanced intellect; its not even in the enjoyable realm of starkly ridiculous Cold War thrillers like Colossus The Forbin Project. You wont be able to follow multiple subplots nor will you care why Kate Mara is running around looking nervous. The blame must go to Wally Pfister normally a gifted cameraman for Christopher Nolan but here making his directorial debut an uncertain helmer who tears too many pages out of his ex-bosss humorless playbook--while forgetting to make his visuals dazzle.

(Peter Mountain) Johnny Depp in Transcendence (Peter Mountain) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday April 16 2014 207 PM Title Transcendence Film Info With Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall. A scientist gets really into his technology. Director Wally Pfister (159).PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. ""Transcendence"" is a movie thats of two minds. Its well-grounded but also over the top. Its a man-vs.-machine epic and also an intimate drama. Its quirky-smart yet sci-fi silly. And it winds up being about half as good as it could be. Johnny Depp is Dr. Will Caster a brilliant scientist working with his wife Evelyn (sexy Rebecca Hall) and fellow researcher Max (Paul Bettany) on startling advancements in artificial intelligence. The team hopes to build a computerized ""brain"" that would be self-sustaining and ever-evolving able to cure diseases and save the planet. But while at a conference an anti-tech terrorist shoots Will with a ""radiation-tipped bullet."" (A regular bullet wouldnt do.) Wills got weeks to live so he Evelyn and Max plug electrodes into Wills brain and ""upload his consciousness"" into a supercomputer theyve built. Will dies -- but his brain lives. And as everyone knows thats asking for trouble. Two years later Wills sentient computerized self is an omniscient powerful force that uses nanotechnology and his own brilliance to heal people. Except he doesnt just make them well He makes them stronger and implants chips in their heads that allow him to communicate with these ""hybrid humans."" As Max teams up with the leader of a radical group (Kate Mara) the government ""shuts down the Internet"" to shut Will himself down. Meanwhile Evelyn attempts a dangerous gambit by begging Will to upload her into the computer too. Thats a lot of plot. And there are additional twists that link the movie to everything from ""Frankenstein"" to ""Colossus The Forbin Project"" to ""The Terminal Man"" ""The Matrix"" and even last years artificial-intelligence love story ""Her."" Director Wally Pfister was the director of photography on ""Inception"" which is yet another strand in the DNA of Jack Paglens script. This all works for a while in a spooky way. Depp is skittish and sad-eyed and once in the computer his HAL 9000-like calmness and image on multiple screens is supremely weird. (The production design though veers from ""12 Monkeys""-style barren to a computer-filled bunker that feels like an aisle at Best Buy.) Hall and Bettany lend solid support. And there are good actors around the edges -- Mara Morgan Freeman Cillian Murphy Clifton Collins Jr. -- playing characters without much to do. Then the film implodes. It doesnt make much sense when Wills creating particles to float up from the ground and impact the atmosphere. The limitations of the wingnut story become obvious battling the energy and verve Pfisters plugged into. Kate Mara in Transcendence (Peter Mountain) Morgan Freeman (l.) Cillian Murphy (center) Johnny Depp (on screen) and Rebecca Hall in Transcendence (Peter Mountain) Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall and Paul Bettanys characters are on the cutting edge of radical change in artificial intelligence in Transcendence. (Peter Mountain) In the end the ideas in ""Transcendence"" may be electric but a lot goes haywire. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" Thurs. - Sun. throughout the day on New Yorks WOR-710 AM and at wor710.com.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1054 a.m. MST April 16 2014Johnny Depp stars as a scientist whos mortally wounded and has his conscsiousness uploaded into a supercomputer. Wally Pfisters film tries to ask big questions but isnt smart enough to answer them.4/18 TRANSCENDENCE | Depp stars as Dr. Will Caster a brilliant scientist in the field of artificial intelligence working to create a sentient machine. When a group of anti-technology extremists put his life in danger he uploads his consciousness into a computer granting him terrifying power in this sci-fi thriller.(Photo Syncopy Inc./DMG Entertainment/Alcon Entertainment)Story HighlightsDepps performance is maddingly sedate though he is part computer.Pfister has long served as Christopher Nolans cinematographer.The story has big ideas but isnt quite sure how to handle them.""Transcendence"" wants to ask the big questions about the positives and negatives of technology in an increasingly online world.What are the limits? How far can artificial intelligence go before it becomes a detriment instead of a benefit? What would make Johnny Depp more engaged in this movie?STORY Pfister Depp reuniteOK some things particularly regarding that last will forever remain a mystery. But the real problem here is that although the film does get around to asking these questions the answers are out of its reach. It looks good -- first-time director Wally Pfister has long worked as Christopher Nolans cinematogrpaher -- but its not as smart as it should be.Will Caster (Depp) is a genius scientist type who works to further the advances of artificial intelligence. Hes in it for the science while his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) wants to use the technology to ""heal the planet."" Their pal Max Waters (Paul Bettany) sees promise in curing diseases but also warns of science overstepping its bounds.A coordinated attack by anti-technology terrorists on artificial-intelligence labs leaves many researchers dead and wounded; an assassination attempt on Will has fatal implications. But Evelyn and Max figure out how to upload Wills consciousness to a supercomputer of Wills design called PINN for Physically Integrated Neural Network.Johnny Depp 5 essential filmsBut is the result really Will? This should be the question at the center of the movie but it comes and goes as the anti-tech bunch plots to stem the reach of the artificial-intelligence supporters who at Wills behest are building a massive computer as Wills (or ""Wills?"") intelligence grows ever stronger. His actions and the motives behind them are drawn into question.This is where Depps performance could have helped out a lot. Look no further than Scarlett Johanssons turn in last years ""Her"" in which she provided the voice for a computer operating system to see how this should be done. But where she was fully engaged Depp seems remote distant. Maybe Will is preoccupied with increasing his intelligence but it drags things down a bit.Morgan Freeman is on hand as Wills mentor who knows whats really what; a quick (and tellingly low-tech) scene with Hall is effective.But as happens so often good ideas eventually give way to a pretty rote conclusion one telegraphed by the framing device Pfister and screenwriter Jack Paglen employ.Too bad. Despite its looks talent and pedigree ""Transcendence"" never becomes the movie it could have been.Director Wally Pfister.Cast Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall Morgan Freeman.Rating PG-13 for sci-fi action and violence some bloody images brief strong language and sensuality.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Photo AP MORE FROM Lou Lumenick Lights Out is a freaky mother-daughter ghost story Bryan Cranston and drugs -- together again in The Infiltrator Captain Fantastic is one of the years best movies A gorgeous starlet an ugly death - and a White House scandal Spielbergs BFG does Dahl right MOVIE REVIEW Transcendence Delete file. Running time 119 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sanitized violence). At the Lincoln Square the Chelsea the Cinema 1 others. Johnny Depp playing a dying scientist has his brain uploaded to mind-numbing effect in ""Transcendence"" -- where nothing happens that you havent seen done much better in almost any computer-oriented sci-fi epic of the last six decades. Lethargic direction bland visuals credulity-straining plotting and tin-eared dialogue turn even pros like Rebecca Hall Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman into sleepwalking bores. Things start off on a promising note with a shot of a computer keyboard being used as a doorstop. The Web has crashed and cant be fixed. Bettany tells us exactly how that happened in droning narration thats going to explain Every. Last. Thing. (Except why the Web cant be fixed.) Hall plays Depps wife and professional collaborator -- hes the worlds leading expert on artificial intelligence. When he suffers a lethal encounter with cyber-terrorists she urges him to let her use his remaining month of life to basically upload his genius to a Web cloud so he can continue his work. I havent given away anything that isnt apparent from the trailer. But now I need to get into spoilerish territory to do a proper demolition job on this fiasco. Depps former associates Bettany and Freeman come to question whether its really a resurrected Depp they hear through computer speakers and see on monitors or just a computer program with evil intent mimicking him. But Hall insists that the digitized version of her formerly modest husband is real and not Memorex -- even when he begins laying plans to control the world. Its not a horrible premise for a movie but the execution is exceedingly trite and sloppy. Unlike most first-rate science fiction this story is utterly divorced from any sort of political or religious context (its ironically being released on Good Friday) not to mention even the faintest emotional resonance (when the film takes a baby step into ""Demon Seed"" territory by having Depp take control of Clifton Collins Jr. as a romantic surrogate it instantly pulls back). Indeed for a film warning about the future ""Transcendence"" seems willfully naive about contemporary realities asking us to believe it would take the FBI (represented by Cillian Murphy in a truly thankless role) two full years to discover that Hall (whose motivations are murky at best) has spent 38 million to build an enormous data center in the California desert powered by thousands of solar panels. Wouldnt the American Medical Association object when cyber-Depp starts curing disabled people on YouTube and turning them into his personal army? Would the FBI and the real Army really join forces with the terrorists who killed Depp to launch an assault on Halls compound -- and use mortars straight out of a 1950s B-movie instead of say drones with smart bombs? I might not be asking these questions if things werent dragging along at a snails pace and Depp were actually playing a mad scientist. Instead Depp is acting in his increasingly problematic and somnolent ""normal person"" mode which is sort of like Keanu Reeves on Quaaludes. Speaking of Neo the special effects make those in ""The Matrix"" from 15 years ago look state-of-the-art by comparison. The whole thing has the generically monotonous look of a TV commercial (unlike say the computer-driven ""Her""). Thats pretty astonishing considering this is the directorial debut of Wally Pfister the brilliant cinematographer behind Christopher Nolans ""Inception"" and Batman movies. ""Transcendence"" is the sort of movie that tries to reassure us by having somebody say something like ""This is astonishing"" roughly every 15 seconds. Believe me its not. If you want to see a great movie about the dangers of artificial intelligence check out what is still Steven Spielbergs best movie of this century ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" -- and skip this transcendentally awful bore.

What fresh hell is this? Mankind has finally collided with technology. Water and food have joined all natural resources in a furnace of ashes. Computers have destroyed the planet. And all because of Johnny Depp. In a demented exercise in nihilistic horror called Transcendence the future is dead. This is as predicted but I didnt expect the end to come in a movie of complete and total incomprehensibility. Transcendence  (1/4 stars) Written by Jack Paglen Directed by Wally Pfister Starring Johnny Depp Rebecca Hall and Morgan Freeman Running time 119 min. Looking at the credits it all becomes obvious. This geek parade is not directed by Christopher Nolan but he produced it from the same bucket of alternate-reality baloney as Inception and The Dark Knight Rises. This time he turns over the reins of confusion to his Inception cameraman Wally Pfister with a screenplay by Jack Paglen who word processed the submental Battlestar Galactica. The result is a pointless nightmare of pretentious science fiction twaddle with no plot no coherence and no heart. You couldnt find a narrative thread with a microscope but the gist of it as far as I can make out is this Johnny Depp plays Dr. Will Caster the worlds leading research scientist in the field of artificial intelligence. Already were in trouble. With his wife and fellow scientist Evelyn (Rebecca Hall an overwrought actress with an annoying habit of staring intensely in this case probably from disbelief) he has invented an all-powerful machine called PINN a man-made god with a brain that can someday rule the universe. Will has his fans including Evelyn and their best friend Max (Paul Bettany) but he is also the target of a gang of anti-technology terrorists called RIFT run by a perky blonde named Bree (Kate Mara). When the extremists attack the lab Will is killed by a bullet carrying radiation poisoning but before he dies he uploads his consciousness into the master computer. Evelyn purchases an abandoned town in the desert and everything in it erecting a gigantic data center commanded by Johnny Depps face on a computer screen. Its the cushiest job in one of the worst movies ever made because the star gets to stay home and blow up the world in his easy chair phoning in the dialogue. First hes a hero re-creating everything that ever existed from human cells to the water supply. But in no time he turns into a massive bloviator so hell-bent on destroying the world that even his wife turns on him. But how do you stop a villain with the turbulent force of a 737? Under the circumstances the titanically terrible acting inspires sympathy. How do you survive an exchange like ""The balance of oxytocins and serotonins in your system are huge"" and ""Are you measuring my hormones""? None of this brain-twisting drivel about changing and controlling regeneration or evolution and pretentious empty-headed filmmaking adds up to a single iota of cogent or convincing logic. No wonder the terrorists are the heroes. ""Im going to transcend them"" says Mr. Depp without a trace of conviction as though he was ordering Chinese takeout while the power grid collapses and the world is plunged into an international blackout. But who can transcend a movie as idiotic as Transcendence?

Pictures shows Johnny Depp from left Rebecca Hall and Paul Bettany in a scene from ""Transcendence."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Peter Mountain) Share PhotoHAL has come a long way.First we had Scarlett Johansson as a human-like operating system. Now Johnny Depp has been uploaded. If the singularity -- when artificial intelligence surpasses human smarts -- is indeed coming at least it has decent taste in movie star avatars.First-time director Wally Pfisters ""Transcendence"" isnt so much the ""Him"" to Spike Jonzes ""Her"" as its a more dystopian vision of the meeting of human consciousness and computer intelligence. It turns out that when computers get sophisticated worse things can happen than Joaquin Phoenix getting his feelings hurt.But whereas ""Her"" was playful and personal about familiar futuristic concepts ""Transcendence"" is clunky and lifeless. Its like the movie version of a paranoid TED talk.In the early scenes of ""Transcendence"" Dr. Will Caster (a disappointingly sleepy Depp) is a TED-style master of the universe speaking confidently in front of large video screens to eager listeners about neurology and artificial intelligence. But there are also protesters to his potentially all-powerful invention the Physically Independent Neural Network (PINN) an early artificial intelligence propelled by a room full of computers that Caster believes could among other things cure cancer.An assassination attempt with a radiation-laced bullet leaves Caster with weeks to live. Desperate to keep his mind alive his loyal sycophantic wife and fellow researcher Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) uploads Casters brain to a PC with PINN hardware. Helping her is their good friend and colleague Max (Paul Bettany serving as narrator).But as anyone with an iPhone knows software updates can be tragic. The transfer is finished just as Caster dies. Soon enough the screen flickers to life first with a few typed words and then seemingly Casters full personality in voice and pixel form.Alert to their plan anti-tech activists (led by Kate Mara) are simultaneously descending. In the chaos Max begins to realize theyve created a high-speed Frankenstein -- an epiphany lost on the mourning Evelyn who flees after uploading Caster to the Internet. He immediately spreads across the Web (he calls Evelyn on her phone) and begins seeking more computing power.It takes a long time for ""Transcendence"" to build to this moment when perhaps it should have begun here in the first place. But it feels like a suddenly intriguing crossroads. Where will this terrifyingly digital Depp go?If you answered to a desert town to build an underground data center for development of radical tissue regeneration techniques guarded by a creepy army of network-connected superhuman zombies -- then your algorithms are more advanced than mine.Yet the urgency and intelligence of ""Transcendence"" isnt artificial. It feels sincerely animated by the frightful questions it poses about computing power and interconnectedness.Pfister making his directorial debut after years as a cinematographer often teamed with director Christopher Nolan (a ""Transcendence"" producer) doesnt exhibit a sure hand with dialogue or a feel for the rhythm of his narrative. Neither does the film have the distinctive form of his prior photography work most notably ""The Dark Knight."" (In imagery ""Transcendence"" pales in comparison to the sumptuous sci-fi of the recent ""Under the Skin."")But as in Nolans ""Inception"" Pfister working from a script by first-time screenwriter Jack Paglen shows an instinct to drive the genre elements toward a more personal story. ""Transcendence"" ultimately hinges on the relationship of Caster and Evelyn. The excellent Hall looking a bit confused by what shes gotten herself into does her best to emotionally ground Pfisters increasingly unfocused and heavy-handed story.Just as in science noble intentions can lead talented artistic minds astray too.""Transcendence"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""sci-fi action and violence some bloody images brief strong language and sensuality.""

Review Is the Heady Johnny Depp Tech Thriller Transcendence Ahead of Its Time? Eric Kohn Apr 15 2014 1159 pm erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk The internet is gone and so goes civilization in the opening minutes of ""Transcendence"" the directorial debut of accomplished cinematographer Wally Pfister a heady science fiction effort that smartly explores mankinds vulnerabilities in the information age. Thats a helluva way to start a story and unsurprisingly nothing that comes next can compete. A polished serious-minded alternative to the action-packed momentum of most contemporary blockbusters ""Transcendance"" offers a keen look at the dangers of relying too heavily on computers for interacting with society. But Pfister struggles to make Jack Paglens moody screenplay as engaging as the ideas provoked by its premise. Yet while never as dynamically involving as Christopher Nolans ""Inception"" for which longtime Nolan director of photography Pfister justifiably won an Oscar  ""Transcendence"" still grapples with provocative existential concepts in similarly thoughtful terms. Despite its inherently silly premise -- a dedicated scientist (Johnny Depp) manages to transplant his consciousness to the cloud moments before his death --  ""Transcendence"" asks enough brainy questions to justify its penetrative outlook. Following the post-apocalyptic prelude in which fellow researcher Max Waters (Paul Bettany) visits the decrepit former residence of Dr. Will Caster (Depp) ""Transcendence"" flashes back to modern times when Caster works alongside his wife and colleague Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) on the possibilities of transferring intelligence to the digital realm. Aided by an older colleague (Morgan Freeman) the team shows tremendous promise but naturally faces as much scorn from the outside world as it does curiosity. In an early presentation of his theories Caster conceives of creating a super-intelligent computer with the ability to rival the IQ of all human beings in the history of consciousness combined.  ""In other words"" a someone shouts from the audience ""you want to create a god."" The doctor stares down his heckler with a focused gaze that borders on campy overstatement. ""Isnt that what man has always wanted?"" he replies. If ""Transcendence"" is at times over the top its still the shrewdest mad scientist movie in recent memory. After an extremist faction attacks the doctors lab and shoots him with a poisonous dart hes suddenly facing his own imminent demise and implores his wife to upload his consciousness before his death. Desperate to keep him around she plays along -- but when the late Casters voice emanates from a hard drive Evelyns colleagues sound a note of caution Is that really her dead husband or just a digital representation of him? By implication the scenario raises the classic case of Theseuss paradox which asks whether a ship that has each of its parts replaced by new ones retains its status as the original object. To its credit the screenplay never overtly says as much. Its the rare case of a big budget spectacle that trusts viewers to think along with it. Unfortunately the couples ensuing plan doesnt quite add up. When Evelyn takes root in a ghost town and helps her digitized husband set up shop with an array of satellite dishes and some undefined scheme to change the world the cryptic nature of their scheme holds some promise. But ""Transcendence"" loses its grip on the mystery in play when the pieces pile up. By the time Caster has created a zombie army of locals -- OK theyre called ""hybrids"" --partly ingrained with his thoughts the Pfister struggles to cobble together a compelling action finale (the concluding desert showdown involves tanks facing off against Depps CGI tendrils and neither hold much visual appeal). Yet even when the explosions take over ""Transcendence"" retrains a muted quality not unlike the grave aura of Nolans own movies leaving the impression that the spectacle is beside the point. By contemporary standards its a stylish low key movie that struggles from an overbearing stern tone but retains a certain intelligent allure for that same reason. Setting the stage for ""an unavoidable collision between mankind and technology"" Pfisters debut struggles to unite several uneven ingredients. Depp is largely too restrained for his own good and when hes reborn as a pixelated face on countless screens he becomes something of an accidental cartoon out of sync with the movies other more realistic ingredients. But Hall as his recklessly loyal partner in crime displays enough credible pathos for their chemistry to hold water particularly once the bond is test when Freemans character implores her to turn against her computerized lover. Their romance an outrageous love affair between man and machine is like a baroque gender-inverted riff on the computer-based relationship in Spike Jonzes ""Her"" -- a parallel that indicates fears at the center of ""Transcendence"" that signal its lasting relevance no matter its flaws. Just as the cheesy 1995 Sandra Bullock drama ""The Net"" reflected a sense of the unknown associated with the evolution of technological communication ""Transcendence"" implies that the machines have irrevocably changed our relationship to reality in ways we have only begun to fathom. At its worst ""Transcendence"" is a messy confused melodrama. It has the atmosphere of a film noir but the tempo of an espionage movie without doing justice to either tradition. Aside from the lyrical images of water falling slowly from a petal that bookends the story much of the imagery is frustratingly bland (an especially ironic outcome given Pfisters background). The director concocts a few compelling images such as clouds sweeping across the desert landscape that eventually becomes the doctors lair but most of its interiors are bathed in empty shadows. Nevertheless in the context of its plot the routine aspects of ""Transcendance"" -- from the cliched shots of fuzzy code scrolling across various screens to the thundering soundtrack at every turn -- imply a wry statement on the mechanization of storytelling. Whether or not Depps character truly achieves singularity he seeks ""Transcendence"" accurately reflects a struggle between man and machine currently unfolding in real life albeit in less outrageous terms. The ambiguous awe-inspiring closing image is tentatively idealistic. By keeping the door open to any number of future outcomes Pfister and Paglen may have created a work ahead of its time that simultaneously embraces technological progress and shudders at its power. Its a flawed achievement that in a century might seem prescient -- whether or not its bleaker predictions come true. Criticwire Grade B- HOW WILL IT PLAY? Warner Bros. releases ""Transcendence"" nationwide on Friday. Mixed word of mouth and Depps less than robust box office appeal might make it a tough sell but could garner solid opening weekend box office returns due to the relative lack of competition.

Wally Pfister takes a spin in the directors chair for this heavy-handed sci-fi cautionary tale. ""Transcendence"" is a most curious name for a movie that never shakes free from those hoary old cliches about the evils of technology and the danger by which man plays at becoming a god. The man in question here is Johnny Depp whose listless lead performance as a brilliant scientist in the field of artificial intelligence does little to aid this overplotted dramatically undernourished debut feature from longtime Christopher Nolan d.p. Wally Pfister. Arriving at a crowded spring box office the pic will test Depps drawing power outside of the Disney franchise factory before weak word of mouth and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" send it packing. One of the manifold pleasures of Spike Jonzes ""Her"" was how elegantly it shrugged off decades of speculative fiction in which technological progress correlated to a loss of human individualism. In its place was the delightful suggestion that rather than battling us for domination artificial intelligence might join us in romantic bliss and then having had its fill journey off in search of some more fulfilling destiny in the cosmos. But in ""Transcendence"" which might have been titled ""Him"" its very much back to square one the culture of technophobia that gave us the predatory mainframes and cyborgs of ""2001"" ""Demon Seed"" and ""Alien"" and that early 90s wave of cyber-paranoia thrillers (""The Net"" ""The Lawnmower Man"" ""Virtuosity"") that now seem as quaint as dial-up Internet. Some might add to that list the collective work of James Cameron almost all of which involves the fusion of man and machine; except in Camerons case technology is just as often friend as foe and in any event an inevitability that we cant reasonably be expected to live without. Yet when ""Transcendence"" begins in some unspecified near-future year the plug has been pulled on that whole crazy information superhighway. Abandoned cell phones litter the streets like tumbleweeds in an old Western; computer keyboards make for convenient door stops. Our narrator (Paul Bettany) reports of an ""unstoppable collision between mankind and technology"" and then begins to unfurl his tale of woe. Fittingly we are in Berkeley that hallowed hippie enclave where the coming of chain stores was once seen as a sign of cultural apocalypse until a more immediate threat arrived in the form of Silicon Valley one-percenters. The movie then flashes back five years and introduces us to Depps unsubtly named Dr. Will Caster and his wife and fellow researcher Evelyn (Rebecca Hall). That the Casters have not (yet) fully sold their souls to demon science is evinced by Wills building of a copper-encased ""technology-free zone"" in the backyard of the couples picture-perfect craftsman home. But meanwhile back at the lab the Casters are hard at work on a sentient machine called PINN (Physically Independent Neural Network) which takes up an entire room (like the all-knowing super-computer from ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"") and converses in a female droid monotone that sounds like HAL 9000s premenstrual sister. Not everyone it seems is thrilled with this idea. In the course of a single day -- a kind of cyber-9/11 -- a series of coordinated terror attacks lays waste to the best and brightest in the A.I. community. Will himself takes a bullet to the belly but makes an incredibly speedy recovery only to learn that the bullet was laced with radiation and now like the poisoned man of the classic noir ""D.O.A."" hes living on borrowed time. Rather hurriedly (as it has a habit of doing) the screenplay by first-timer Jack Paglen introduces the notion that just as one might save a video or music file to a hard drive so might we do the same with an entire human consciousness. And so with some help from their best scientist friend (Bettany) the Casters spend Wills dying days digitizing the good doctors noggin for posterity. Thus ""Transcendence"" arrives at that old irresolvable conundrum Is it live or is it Memorex? Staring out from a bank of computer monitors the digital Will looks and sounds awfully like the old one -- and yet as with George Romeros zombies looks can be deceiving. This new Will isnt content to stay contained on one (massive) server. He wants to stretch his bits and bytes to be uploaded into the cloud (and not only one suspects so that he can debate philosophy with Alan Watts). And Evelyn who wants more than anything to believe that her husband is still somehow alive happily obliges. Appearing periodically to offer grave prognoses is Morgan Freeman (one of several members of the Nolan stock company who appear here) once more cast as the wise weary Voice of Reason. There are intriguing half-formed ideas afoot in ""Transcendence"" but the script and Pfisters heavy humorless direction tend to reduce everything to simplistic standoffs between good and evil -- or in this case heartless technocrats and crunchy-granola resistance fighters known as RIFT (Revolutionary Independence From Technology) and led by plucky martyr-in-training Bree (Kate Mara). Take that PINN. The bigger problem is that all the characters on both sides are so uniformly bland and lifeless that one can hardly tell the flesh-and-blood humans from the army of man/machine ""hybrids"" Will begins assembling with his suddenly infinite powers (including for murkily defined reasons the ability to manipulate real-world organic matter). Imagine a version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" in which the aliens arrive to discover a world of anodyne pod people already in place. Its a bit of a cliche (which doesnt make it untrue) that when cameramen turn to directing they make movies long on visual splendor and short on storytelling. In any case most who make the transition (Jack Cardiff Haskell Wexler Gordon Willis John Bailey Dean Semler) eventually go back to shooting for others. With ""Transcendence"" Pfister has certainly delivered a good-looking well-produced picture albeit one lacking in the memorable images he has supplied in excess in Nolans employ. (Pfisters d.p. of choice Jess Hall is big on sun flares and slow-mo water droplets.) More critically hes made a movie empty of feeling even as it labors to convince us that the entire future of the human race is hanging in the balance. There is at the storys center an attempt at a grand doomed sci-fi romance between Will and Evelyn but one need only think back to David Cronenbergs remake of ""The Fly"" or Nolans own ""Inception"" to see how short ""Transcendence"" falls on this particular score. Presented with much the same challenge as Scarlett Johansson in ""Her"" -- to play a character who for most of the movie exists only as a disembodied voice (and in this case a flickering face on a screen) -- Depp fails to convey any real sense of the passion and curiosity that supposedly drive Will Caster to do what he does. The gravely beautiful Hall (who was along with Johansson one of the women caught up in the epic magicians duel in Nolans ""The Prestige"") seems to have been directed to deliver her entire performance in an unwavering state of glassy-eyed anxiety. Indeed long before the Web goes bust ""Transcendence"" has already flatlined. Composer Mychael Danna rattles the speakers of the new Dolby Atmos sound system with a score that combines lush string arrangements and occasional electronic twangs whenever the basso profundo sound design isnt doing same.

Yokeena Jamar says April 21 2014 at 1250 am What???? I can not believe the bad reviews floored by the reviews of ""Transcendence"" this movie was brilliant. I personally think some have clearly missed the mark. Now I must admit an hour into the film I had to reach for some caffeine but by far this movie had the best ending Ive seen in a long time. So I just simply want to comment on the ending. Those of you who read this and havent seen it I suggest you not read further because Im about to ruin it for you Evelyn in position to what she believes ""save humanity"" in a private moment with Will as he realizes her wishes have changed the wishes to End what she has dreamed for and longed for will does what she asks. At The moment of infecting himself Evelyn realizes that what she thought was will truly was him...will looks her in the eye and says ""we are in the garden imagine us there"". Omg So this computer conscience Will was pure consciousness in ""thought form"" as so they become one as they transcend themselves to the garden where the copper keeps out all things from interfering with the biological makeup of organic matter. Her tear falls as a droplet of water that contains their consciousness (because they imagined themselves there) falls from the copper onto another organic object (the flower) and lives again and quite frankly I saw a sequel from the compounds that were straddling about in the water molecules. What an awesome husband...This was a Shakespeare kind of ending. A love story first then a science fiction movie. It was just beautiful. Hats off to beautiful filmmaking. Btw. I am a film student and writer....loved it Reply Chuck Anziulewicz says April 18 2014 at 858 am The concept of a coming ""Technological Singularity"" (look it up on Wikipedia) is certainly compelling. Imagine uploading your consciousness into a digital platform neuron by neuron. Could you thus transcend your physical existence and live forever in cyberspace? Or would it not REALLY be you just a copy of you? This raises all kinds of provocative questions about the nature of consciousness identity and even what we commonly call the soul. The old SyFy series ""Caprica"" did an interesting job depicting a world on the cusp of a technological singularity and Charles Stross novel ""Accelerando"" explores where all this might be heading in our own future. While the concept has prophets like Ray Kurzwiel it also has plenty of detractors who dismiss it as some kind of ""Geek Rapture."" This new film ""Transcendence"" apparently aspired toward exploring the concept of the technological singularity and I was looking forward to seeing it. But now as I sort through the mostly negative reviews it seems that what MIGHT have been a compelling visionary film ultimately turns little more than just another SFX-driven techno-thriller. Reply KB says April 16 2014 at 1047 pm Depp has had flop after flop for the past several years. Some of his movies have made money but they have all been critically panned. He needs a new agent or maybe a reality check... Or acting lessons? Hard to believe studios continue to pay him big bucks for so little return. Reply Chris says April 17 2014 at 1047 pm He actually only had 2 flops recently. Why does he need a reality check? Reality check to stop doing movies? Hes a great actor and he is always capable of giving good performances. So little return? Are you kidding me? Do you think what he does is really that easy? You are the one who really needs a reality check here. Hes JOHNNY DEPP he will always get paid huge paychecks. Hes got his own production company for gods sake. Reply rjbailey says April 16 2014 at 639 pm Reblogged this on Locating Frankensteins Brain. Reply Beat Me Up says April 16 2014 at 557 pm I read this script and it seemed slightly lifeless but what really ruins it is transposing 2014/eco-politics in something set in the future. It drains life from the work. The idea is use your imagination not your politics. Good review though I disagree with the Depp comments he was merely interrupting the script. Reply Christine says April 16 2014 at 543 pm This review makes me want to see the film as I trust the people who made the film and the cast in it way more than I do the critic. Reply Chris Tomlin says April 16 2014 at 348 pm ""Demon Seed?"" ""Terminator?"" ""2001?"" ""Lawnmower Man?"" I dont think youre going back far enough for your technophobia/playing-God dystopian visions. How about the 1953 sci-fi classic ""Donovans Brain?"" First thing I thought of. Reply Well says April 16 2014 at 1009 am I feel like people are having something against Depp lately that they just want to see him flop. Am i right? Reply XOX says April 17 2014 at 1048 pm You are so damn right. Its sad. Reply Julienne says April 16 2014 at 816 am Drawing Power? See Tonto. Reply Ralcarbo says April 16 2014 at 612 am sometimes an idea is better on paper Reply Knut Graabein says April 16 2014 at 559 am Somebody in the comment section wrote ""terrible review"". But I disagree This review answered everything I wondered about this movie and now I have second thoughts about seeing it. Reply Stan says April 16 2014 at 408 am But we got the Phister? You mean DPs arent directors? Aw Hollywood I just want to pinch your cheek. Next time try the key grip. Reply iamborghue says April 16 2014 at 336 am DRAT I was hoping this would be a great film. I liked the previews and still plan on seeing it but this review has made me a bit disappointed. Oh well I guess Captain America will be triumphant again. Reply Asronce says April 15 2014 at 1124 pm Producers who hold their films from prescreening do so to avoid loss ticket sales on opening weekend. This is huge red flag which is a shame as there was high expectations for Depp and the film. Varietys astute preview may have cost them ten million dollars on Friday at the box-office. Perhaps it will recoup some its losses from video. Reply Glenn C. says April 15 2014 at 938 pm There are so many good scripts out there that never see the light of day and yet these get made Why? Because of connections and a good agent that can sell Its unfair Typical unfairness Reply Yirmin says April 16 2014 at 1233 pm Reality check my friend. Connections and nepotism are rampant everywhere. Nothing wins on its own merits anymore. Even if you in your garage made the best movie of all time it would never get out there unless you had been squeezed from the right scrotum... is it unfair? Yes but nothing is going to change it. Reply James says April 15 2014 at 924 pm You obviously have something aginst Depp and want the movie to fail. Reply Beat Me Up says April 16 2014 at 629 pm Well Yirmin as someone who writes spec scripts in H/wood in the hopes of finding representation I must disagree (I shoot docs on the side too though I just collect gigs of HD at this juncture.) You must keep hope alive. It is pretty much impossible to break through though it does happen. There was once a tedious little film called Primer that was shot on 10gs (in a garage) and it broke through. The filmmaker is (apparently) a complicated man; and thus he recedes into darkness. I saw Primer recently thought it would have worked better as a power point presentation. Its a good time to be a screenwriter its just happens to be run by Wall Street so its tough to reach the beach but writers must write regardless.

Like a snazzy new laptop that immediately heats up and stops working this exploration of our reliance upon technology -- and how far mankind will subsume itself to its creations -- seems great when its right out of the box. But by the end of two hours youll find yourself wishing that first-time screenwriter Jack Paglen had taken his creation to a Genius Bar for a thorough de-fragging. See video Transcendence Trailer 5 Things We Learned From the Johnny Depp Thriller Researcher Will Caster (Johnny Depp) has become famous as one of the worlds leading proponents of artificial intelligence but hes more interested in how far the field can progress than in any ethical issues or altruistic possibilities of his work; thats something he leaves to his close friend Max (Paul Bettany) who wants to use technology to save the world. Good or bad their AI research has drawn the attention of a group of Luddite anti-tech terrorists who manage to simultaneously strike researchers around the country killing several and wounding Will with a bullet. When it turns out that bullet was treated with radioactive polonium the scientist learns he has only weeks to live. (And if you ask ""What about AI researchers in other countries?"" youve already put more thought into all this than Paglen and Pfister did. But more on that later.) Wills loving wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall""gt;Rebecca Hall) is at first devastated but when they realize that one of their slain comrades successfully uploaded the consciousness of a rhesus monkey from its brain into a computer Evelyn and Max attempt to do likewise with Will. They transfer his thoughts memories and personality into his super-computer PINN (Physically Integrated Neural Network). Once the upload is complete Evelyn is thrilled but Max immediately worries that the computer has become cognizant -- what Will called ""transcendence"" -- and is using a simulacra of Will to get Evelyn to go along with its plans which involve making a ton of money on stock trades buying up an entire deserted town and building an elaborate underground bunker with a mega-giga-computer from which ghost-in-the-machine Will can change reality as we know it. Also read Prometheus 2 Moving Forward With Transcendence Writer Jack Paglen Up to this point ""Transcendence"" is a little ""Her"" and a little HAL 9000 -- which is fine -- but once we get clued into what cyber-Wills ultimate plans are the film gets a lot dumber throwing in contrivances that keep the audience from wrestling with complex questions and raising plot points that make less and less sense the more you think about them. This is the kind of film where by the time youve reached your car in the parking lot you find yourself asking your date questions like ""Why was the nano-technology visible to the human eye?"" and ""If computer Will can scan Evelyns biochemical emotional reactions why cant it catch her lying?"" The movie begins with a flash-forward that takes away much of the suspense and thats the kind of move you can only pull off if youve got another better card to play. But by the time ""Transcendence"" wraps up the movie has clearly chickened out of grappling with any of its deeper issues and instead provides a cowardly quick fix. Also read Johnny Depp Makes First Promotional Visit to China Hawking Transcendence Pfister whos been shooting for director Christopher Nolan (executive-producing here) for years definitely brings some visual style to the proceedings even though he hasnt come up with a new way to show a thinking computer (lots of screens with scrolling gibberish characters) or a sleek tech complex (get ready for those long white hallways that date back at least to ""THX-1138"" and ""The Andromeda Strain""). If theres one solid take-away from ""Transcendence"" its Rebecca Halls performance as a computer genius (shes not just Wills wife shes his collaborator) so blinded by grief and by the possibilities of pushing science to the next level that she aids and abets Wills ambitious terrifying agenda. She remains committed to the character even when the plots logic goes 404 - Not Found. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
