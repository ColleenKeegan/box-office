Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 01 2010 225PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Solitary Man Directed by Brian Koppelman and David Levien Written by Brian Koppelman Starring Michael Douglas Jenna Fischer Susan Sarandon Classification 14A Solitary Man makes too good on its title - its a fascinating character study isolated within a mediocre film. Fascinating because this is a rounded portrait of a specific type of aging alpha male as reprehensible as he is charming manipulative yet honest too sadly lacking in moral fibre but admirably devoid of self-pity. With all his messy contradictions the guy rings true. What doesnt at least not always is the plot attending his decline and fall. The result is a script that like an unwise jeweller sticks a pure gem inside a tarnished setting. On camera almost continually Michael Douglas commands the films centre and navigates the character with the skill of someone whos been there before. He has. His Ben Kalmen is part Gordon Gekko from Wall Street and part Grady Tripp from Wonder Boys with a dash of Willy Loman tossed in to keep us off balance. Indeed Ben used to be a car salesman rose to Fortune 500 heights with a nationwide string of luxury dealerships and then prompted by one of those dubious plot mechanisms lost it all six years ago. Lost his empire courtesy of some shady business practices lost his marriage thanks to many quickie affairs. But his swagger has stayed intact along with his confidence and in the early frames Ben is on the move again pushing 60 now yet still closing deals including one guaranteed to restore his fortune. Hes still chasing skirts too charming them off women less than half his age. Of course the young lovelies are his psychological Botox smoothing out his wrinkled self-image although hes fully aware of the cliche and unafraid to embrace it - after all theyre willing and hes able. Asked by his ex-wife Nancy (Susan Sarandon) ""What does that get you?"" Ben snaps back with unapologetic candour ""Plenty."" Its precisely such candour that makes him both appalling and appealing nearly but never quite pathetic. Consider his relationship with his 30-something daughter. Happily married Susan (Jenna Fischer) finds herself in the position of mothering not just her young son but her forever-young father too. He chats to her casually about his sexual escapades bristles if she calls him ""Dad"" in public places and brazenly borrows money whenever his wallet gets slim. Through all this with its creepy impropriety Susan doubles as his fiercest critic and his willing accomplice. She sees right through him yet remains entranced by the sight. We do exactly the same. Its not often that a movie offers up a sinner who is fully aware of his sins and their corrosive consequences yet is uncomplaining when they arrive because on balance he prefers the excitement of vice to the tedium of virtue. Sure his fall is inevitable. Yet its manner is not and this is where Brian Koppelmans screenplay shows signs of contrivance. Although the supporting cast here is strong - not just Sarandon but Mary-Louise Parker Danny De Vito Jesse Eisenberg - too many of them seem merely like convenient cogs in a narrative wheel designed to take Ben down. In that sense our solitary man gets too much help moving through the arc of his story. Worse the primary motivation for his behaviour (I shouldnt give it away) seems trite and unconvincing. This type of character doesnt need any further inducement to behave badly not when vice is its own reward. Ironically then the film may be a victim of its success. The gem at the centre is so multifaceted so knowingly selfish yet incapable of self-deceit that the movie resists a conventional plots easy turns. We dont want him redeemed nor do we need him punished beyond what he inflicts on himself ""At your highest moments and your lowest youre alone."" His place is on that lonely island - ours is to watch him there from a safe distance too intrigued to wave goodbye.

Sex and the fear of death. Are there four more hackneyed elements in the history of movies? In all of literature dating back to the oral tradition? Probably not which is why they make a fine excuse for a bit of dramedic cud-chewing in Solitary Man yet more proof that Michael Douglas can do anything he pleases so long as hes playing a jerk. What joy it is to watch the man slime himself on camera whether hes doing the Gekko for Oliver Stone going ballistic in Falling Down or playing a pot-smoking literary basket case in Wonder Boys. For his latest turn hes an unctuous aging sex addict who messes up every part of his life he could possibly mess up. And then some. Douglas plays Ben a former New York car salesman whose weakness for young women and easy money got him in trouble with the wife and the law. The movie opens ""about six and a half years ago"" on a doctors visit in which Ben in the midst of some schmoozy blather about dealerships and TV spots learns he has a heart irregularity. As the physician informs him hell need more testing Douglas face freezes -- it comes to a screeching halt like its crashed up against an unmovable object -- and were sold. Flash forward to ""today"" where Ben is now an out-of-work businessman with a plan to get back in it. He also has a girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) with an 18-year-old daughter Allyson (Imogen Poots) who becomes the modified Lolita figure in the tale of Bens downfall. When this likable rake accompanies her on a college-interview visit to his alma mater a stupid impulse yields a string of bad consequences and yet more stupid impulses that propel the film along. Solitary Man was penned by Brian Koppelman and directed by Koppelman and David Levien his writing partner on The Girlfriend Experience and Rounders not to mention Oceans Thirteen. Its worth noting that their last (and first) feature directorial effort 2001s Knockaround Guys was a total stinker. But it was a total stinker with creative ambition the sort of failed effort that looks good on paper until it implodes on screen. This time they nail the execution coaxing relaxed performances from Susan Sarandon as Bens rather sophic ex-wife and Jesse Eisenberg as the decent kid who gives Ben a campus tour. Danny DeVitos role as Bens moral and marital antithesis -- a humble deli owner who approaches the world with a level loving maturity -- couldnt be more obvious yet the two actors hit a sweet spot of laid-back candor in their scenes together. Tricia Cooks editing and Alwin H. Kuchlers (Sunshine) cinematography lend a seamless cohesion that reveals major turning points in minor details. And while the movies end zone is visible from a long way off Douglas brings us there with nettled desperation -- and an unflagging charm that takes a turn toward creepy. Ben is a walking cliche. Douglas performance is not. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals KeySmart 2.0 Compact Key Organizer for 10 + free shipping Kitchen and Bath at Home Depot Up to 40% off + free shipping...

"Solitary Man The liar in winter | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSolitary Man The liar in winterFor once we get under the skin of an oily Michael Douglas character understanding the self-aggrandizement and self-destruction.Michael Douglass Ben offers life lessons to Jesse Eisenbergs Daniel.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. July 1 2010Solitary Man (out of 4)Starring Michael Douglas Susan Sarandon Danny DeVito Mary-Louise Parker Jenna Fischer Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots. Directed by Brian Koppelman and David Levien. At Cumberland and Empire Empress Walk theatres. 90 minutes. 14ANobody does oily like Michael Douglas.Whether hes smashing corporations in Wall Street or simply wrecking his marriage in Fatal Attraction he oozes an arrogant sense of entitlement that makes him hard to like -- but also as hard to ignore as a grease stain on the carpet.Article Continued BelowIts much the same situation in Solitary Man yet the film is different in one key regard you actually feel for the guy at least a bit. For once we get under the skin of his character and begin to understand why self aggrandizement and self-destruction come together so often with him. Credit the screenplay by Brian Koppelman who co-directed the film (with David Levien) but the acting also excels this is one of Douglass best roles in many a moon.On the surface his Ben Kalmen is a regular BP gusher. He calls himself ""New Yorks Honest Car Dealer"" although you wonder how truthful and how old that slogan is. He radiates insincerity except for when hes being brutally honest.He always dresses in black which is perhaps too obvious an indicator of the colour of his soul. But it fits the title song with the late Johnny Cash performing Neil Diamonds ""Solitary Man.""Kalmen prides himself on being able to sell a car to anybody whether they need one or not. He believes he can read minds and creeps people out by coldly sizing them up the way a vulture looks at prey. But he doesnt like it if people try to figure him out and hes more than vain about his age which is almost 60. Recently divorced from his wife Nancy (Susan Sarandon) hes sadly pretending to be young and eligible. He forbids his grown daughter Susan (Jenna Fischer) from calling him ""dad"" and also her young son from calling him ""granddad"" whenever attractive women are within earshot.A prologue visit to the doctors office 61/2 years earlier gives us the first clue why Kalmen is not your typical Douglas oozer. ""I dont love your EKG"" the doc says after checking out his heart. He advises Kalmen to get further tests and possible treatment.Jump to current times and Kalmen appears none the worse for wear. His divorce seems to have proceeded amicably. Koppelmans very smart script keeps us guessing as to whats really going on as it doles out small pieces of information that keep the plot moving and our judgment of Kalmen suspended in midair. Kalmen is evidently in some of kind of business trouble and chicanery is implied. Hes in so deep he cant obtain a bank loan through regular channels or even pay the rent on his apartment. Hes relying on the generosity of his daughter and on the business connections of his affluent girlfriend Jordan (Mary-Louise Parker) to stay housed and to start up a new auto dealership.Theres a quid pro quo to Jordans assistance she wants Kalmen to accompany her daughter Allyson (Imogen Poots) on a weekend trip to the same Ivy League college where Kalmen studied decades earlier. She wants him to use his sales skills to persuade the dean to admit the flighty Allyson. Kalmen reluctantly agrees -- he has no choice -- but the trip is fraught with uncomfortable memories and dangerous traps.Its the same college where he met Nancy and the town is also the home of old friend Jimmy (Danny DeVito) whom Kalmen casually dumped when his star began rising. While on the campus Kalmen tries to keep himself busy by offering life lessons to an ultra-shy student Daniel (Jesse Eisenberg of course) and also some unsolicited sexual advice to Allyson who is trouble wrapped in a smirk.So many famous faces keeping popping up in the film its almost a distraction. Anonymity would have aided the intrigue but this is a minor complaint.Solitary Man is a sad movie but also a wise one. It understands the fears of many successful men once the lions of their field who cant cope with the taming that life reversals and the passage of time often demand.Guys like Kalmen view the world as a series of conquests -- ""Out there is nothing but possibilities"" he tells Daniel -- but sometimes the world has a way of bringing us right down to the ground.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    19degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Comments (1) Solitary Man Recommended Rated R  99 minutes  2010 Michael Douglas tries again to recapture the heroic irresponsibility of his college professor character in Wonder Boys (2000) and though this drama by writer-director Brian Koppelman hardly measures up to the earlier film it comes a lot closer than King of California (2007). Douglas plays a washed-up New York car dealer who just turned 60 and fearing the reaper has blown off his wife (Susan Sarandon) in search of younger women and alienated his grown daughter (Jenna Fischer) with his tacky silver-fox maneuvers. When his jaded girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) asks him to chaperone her daughter (Imogen Poots) during her college admissions interview at his alma mater the old party animal really gets into trouble. David Levien codirected; the fine supporting cast includes Richard Schiff Jesse Eisenberg and Danny DeVito. By J.R.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune June 10 2010 -- 904pm Video (0318)  Michael Douglas gives his best acting performance to date as an automobile magnate whos down on his luck. Shari Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Michael Douglas has played some scoundrels in his day but few have been as incorrigible or as perversely endearing as Ben Kalman. A respected pillar of the business community (""New Yorks Honest Car Dealer"") and a decent family man he suffers an existential crisis in his cardiologists office and begins living each day as if it were his last. Unfortunately for Ben and everyone he encounters it isnt. We meet him after half a decade of heedless hedonism has drained his bank account sunk his reputation and alienated most of his family and former friends. All in all Bens an extra-large trash bag. Were naturally sympathetic to film underdogs even the unabashed rogues and Ben is the fall guy in a comedy of cosmic humiliation. Hes a satirical archetype the high-flying businessman brought low by hubris and a yen for women a third his age. A man who used to close multimillion dollar deals with a grin and a handshake hes burned out his exhaustion mirroring that of a staggering economy. And nobody does sagging male vanity as well as Douglas. Buoyed by director Brian Koppelmans sharp script and a stellar supporting cast he makes Bens skid into the ditch mesmerizing. His ex-wife Nancy (Susan Sarandon) views him with weary affection and might welcome him back if he ever snapped out of his self-absorption. For the time being however hes wooing Jordan (Mary-Louise Parker) a brittle socialite whose well-connected father might help Ben resuscitate his career. Incapacitated by the sniffles Jordan deputizes Ben to take her monumentally spoiled daughter Allyson (Imogen Poots) to her college interview in Boston. This proves to be the worst plan in the history of bad plans. Feed Loader Dml - Michael Douglas and Susan Sarandon star in ""Solitary Man."" Bens ego and libido collide with Allysons hostility to her mother in a conflagration that is excruciating and hilarious to behold. And just for a little collateral damage Ben mentors Cheston (Jesse Eisenberg) offering the sweet shy sophomore cynical tips about closing ""the transaction"" with girls. Douglas redeems Ben with flashes of charm and self-deprecating humor. Ben is quick to say the worst about himself as if that pre-empted everyone elses legitimate criticism. The screenplay shows that he can fool some of the people some of the time but he cant fool himself any more. The film doesnt offer a pat story of redemption but reveals Bens gradual awakening to his own line of bull. In scenes where Ben is on his own Douglas drops the power-player razzmatazz slumping wearily. Those are the moments that reveal how draining the alpha dog act has become. The finale strikes just the right note of wary optimism. Ben is too flawed for a happy ending but by the fadeout we know him so well we cant help but wish him well.

For its unpitying look at a pitiful man it rivals the actors turns in the underknown Wonder Boys and King of California.This time he is Ben Kalmen disgraced New York businessman who amuses himself and appalls everyone else by bedding women and girls with daddy issues. Some might describe this incorrigible lech a sexagenarian in more ways than one as Hugh Hefner with Gordon Gekko hair and a geckos reptilian ethics. Directors Brian Koppelman and David Levien (working from Koppelmans original script) structure their film as a portrait of a drowning man who methodically cuts every lifeline.Once known as the tristate areas only honest car dealer Ben has cashed in his chips for some chippies and cheap thrills. Because he can? Because hes distracting himself from his fear of aging?Bens wife (Susan Sarandon) has decamped. His daughter (Jenna Fischer) is in the dubious position of parenting her parent. (""Dont call me Grandpa Call me Captain Ben"" he commands his grandson.) His mistress (Mary-Louise Parker) goes for the jugular when Ben puts the moves on her daughter (Imogen Poots).Douglas is extraordinary as the salesman who believes his own spiel trying to reclaim his vanished empire by working connections he treats with such casual contempt. For this businessman everything - work sex relationships - is a transaction designed to maximize his personal pleasure and minimize his emotional exposure.How is it that Ben who deceives no one else can be so self-deceived? This is the delicious paradox of Douglas performance. The more unscrupulous Ben is the more entertaining Solitary Man gets.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + As he hits his mid-60s Michael Douglas is looking more and more like his father Kirk in the tightness of his features and aggressive jut of his jaw. And Ben Kalmen sardonically referred to in ""Solitary Man by his former title ""New Yorks honest car dealer is a part that Kirk might relish even as it fits neatly in with the rogues gallery that Douglas the younger has established over decades of fine nasty work.""Solitary Man is the first movie to be directed by screenwriter Brian Koppelman (""Rounders ""Oceans 13). Its a character film and Ben is its character a man who hasnt fallen from grace so much as ejected himself from it. Divorced from a good woman (Susan Sarandon) estranged from most of his family a pariah in the auto industry and much of New Yorks business and social circles Ben pleases no one but himself and by extension the more curious and forgiving members of the audience. We see what he doesnt though an old man running as fast as he can toward his vanishing youth.When we first meet Ben hes joining his daughter (Jenna Fischer of ""The Office) and young grandson (Jake Siciliano) for a Riverside Park playdate making sure the boy calls him ""Captain Ben so as not to put off the blond bombshell on a nearby bench. Throughout ""Solitary Man gazing at beautiful women serves as the heros sustenance with food a distant second. If he can still flirt he still matters. A salesman to the last Ben believes in the product even if everyone else has stopped buying.Having disgraced himself with the car dealers equivalent of a Ponzi scheme Ben has paid his fine and done hard time (one night in jail) and is desperate to get back in the game. The father of his current girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) has connections that could win approval for a new dealership. The girlfriend also has a college-bound daughter played by the lovely and ineffably named Imogen Poots who drips with know-it-all hauteur and might not be above playing a game of Daddy with Ben. Presented with a good idea and a bad one trust our man to jump on the hand grenade every single time.The visit to the college -- Bens alma mater -- is rich with the human comedy of self-inflicted damage. Accompanying the girlfriends daughter onto campus he picks a fight with a hulking Ultimate Frisbee player and befriends a timid sophomore guide (Jesse Eisenberg) dispensing sexual wisdom with threadbare bravado. ""There is nothing noble in failure Ben asserts readily ignoring his own life.Why do we keep watching this sad sad man? Because hes ecstatic as long as he avoids facing reality and Douglas makes that ecstasy a marvelous thing to behold. By the films midpoint Ben has sunk to working in the off-campus diner operated by an old school chum (Danny DeVito) and he cant believe his good fortune So many college girls so little time. Ben has no fear of death -- which is always interesting to watch -- because its vastly preferable to the sexual invisibility that comes with age.""Solitary Man is too shapeless and cursorily plotted to fully work as a story but Koppelman and his co-director David Levien generously surround the hero with reliable actors doing solid work; if you can get past the catastrophe of Bens behavior the films a genuine pleasure. At its best ""Solitary Man feels like one of those novels told by a beautiful screw-up in feckless first-person prose -- a book by J.P. Donleavy maybe -- but because its a movie were allowed to be inside Bens head and outside him simultaneously. It takes a confident actor to swing this freely an acrobat with a working knowledge of lifes jokes and disasters. But Douglas has always enjoyed playing on the knife-edge of egotism. For him -- and for us -- thats where the fun lies.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company. Thought you might like ...

"Solitary Man A lead turns character actor - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 3 starsSolitary Man A lead turns character actorMichael Douglas makes a hedonist fallen on hard times seem appealing.June 10 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticA modest but juicy character study of a horn dog in winter ""Solitary Man"" stars Michael Douglas as the sort of fellow audiences can have a hard time warming to the self-destructive hedonist slouching toward redemption. With a wolfish leer peeking out from behind a facade of trustworthiness Douglas plays Ben Kalmen who made his fortune selling cars and lost it all cutting ethical and legal corners. His ex ( Susan Sarandon) knew the better Ben in the old days and still recognizes traces of him in the back-slapping somewhat desperate character of the storys present. The movie takes Ben to his old Boston college where he donated a lot of money in flusher times and where the daughter (Imogen Poots) of his lover ( Mary-Louise Parker) is thinking of studying. Its not hard to see where this quasi-incestuous road trip is headed. But screenwriter Brian Koppelman (""Oceans Thirteen"") makes Bens bed-hopping part of a stimulatingly unpredictable whole. Koppelmans writing has its glib streak; occasionally he lets his characters (smart and quick-witted all) become variations on a single type of wiseacre. Yet even when the women in craven Bens life are being idiots theyre tart-tongued and self-assured even in their recklessness. Koppelman and David Levien co-directed the film in an easygoing style. Their penchant for longish takes allows the actors to actually interact with one another in the same shot. At his peak of movie stardom it wasnt easy to locate Douglas talent behind the gritted teeth and seething misogyny of ""Fatal Attraction"" ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Disclosure."" It takes an actor years to unwind after a streak like that. Then thanks partly to ""Wonder Boys"" Douglas did. ""Solitary Man"" like that picture will have to fight for attention. But in its scruffy take-me-or-leave-me way it deserves attention. Also Jesse Eisenbergs in it playing a sweetly insecure college student assigned to Ben during his stay. People who think Eisenberg can do only one kind of role arent paying attention. In everything he does whether ""Adventureland"" or ""Zombieland"" or this picture (which could be called ""Horndogland"") his timing is magically astute and he and Douglas are lovely together. Jenna Fischer plays Bens semi-estranged daughter; like Eisenberg she barely seems to be acting in a good way. Plenty couldve been improved in the script stage with ""Solitary Man"" The back story regarding Bens financial ruin gets pretty horsey and though its hard to begrudge any screenplay with some wit and nerve this one grows softer and more conventional in the later stages. Still its a pleasant surprise about an unpleasant guy brought to life by an ingratiating paradox a movie star who has turned into a wily character man. mjphillipstribune.com 3 stars MPAA rating R (for language and some sexual content).

By Anthony Lane At home Louis-Do de Lencquesaing Chiara Caselli and Manelle Driss.   Credit Illustration by Ben Kirchner From the fact that the hero drives a car with a cell phone in one hand a cigarette in the other no hands on the wheel and no seat belt it can swiftly be deduced that ""The Father of My Children"" is a French film. At one superb moment he even has two phones on the go in order to check a text while he talks. After the cops pull him over for speeding at night and arrest him he seems not just unsurprised but undismayed proudly making light of the situation when his wife--also in a perfectly good mood--comes to fetch him from the police station. ""I wish youd seen how charming I was"" he says. Like I said French film. The hero in question is Gregoire Canvel a movie producer played by Louis-Do de Lencquesaing as an entirely credible blend of the dedicated and the feckless. His first words are Cest moi and what follows is the dissolution of the moi. At the start everything looks fine--frazzled for sure but not beyond salvage or soothing. Gregoire runs a small production company in Paris and the street-level shots of the city during the opening credits with a zestful tune on the soundtrack imply that life is leading him a merry dance but nothing worse. True the laboratory that processes his movies is waiting for the million euros that he owes and the Korean film crew that just flew into town numbers eighteen rather than eight including a baby. On the other hand a shoot in Sweden is going ahead despite the fierce whims of the director and the suicide of one of his underlings. Gregoires juggling of these different projects which could have left ""The Father of My Children"" looking fussy or overburdened is reflected instead by a mercurial switch in tones with the dialogue--and the cameras focus of attention--alighting with ease on both the throwaway and the grave. If calm reigns anywhere it is at home. In fact Gregoire has two homes one in Paris and one in the country near a river. This hardly suggests a man in dire straits yet we never begrudge him such luxury perhaps because we gather at once that love especially the love of family strikes him as non-negotiable. How Mia Hansen-Love who wrote and directed ""The Father of My Children"" manages to render this certainty of the heart without slumping into the sentimental is something of a puzzle. One solution may lie with her casting which favors a forthright briskness over the cute. Chiara Caselli neat and not easily fazed plays Gregoires Italian wife Sylvia with whom he has three daughters the teen-age Clemence (Alice de Lencquesaing the real-life child of the leading man) plus the younger and more voluble duo of Valentine (Alice Gautier) and Billie (Manelle Driss). The scenes in which the family wanders down through dusky stillness to the waters edge or tours a deserted chapel where Gregoire recounts the history of feuds far older and more blood-soaked than anything in the movie business flow with a serenity that eludes him as soon as he rejoins the waking world. Fifty-two minutes into the film a little short of the halfway mark something happens. It is a major something though it is typical of Hansen-Love that she handles it with an almost casual deftness as if to remind us--and here we are as far from the ethic of the blockbuster as it is possible to get--that what matters is not events however explosive but the shock waves that ripple out to other lives. Suffice it to say without disclosing details that the second half of ""The Father of My Children"" veers away from the father toward the children. In particular we start to notice Clemence who has been a grumpy drifting presence; in short a teen-ager. ""Id like you to decide to be happy"" her father once told her as if that were an option for her or for anyone else. Now though Clemence seems to open her eyes and stretch like the daughter in the final line of Kafkas ""Metamorphosis."" We see her going to movies taking a lover and discovering a long-lost brother. (This requires her to overhear chatter in a cafe the only forced coincidence in the movie and a rare false note.) You could argue that the film fails to revive the harassed intensities of its first hour but I doubt whether they could have been sustained; and what we get instead with its stunned and glassy air yields a slow-breathing drama of its own. The case of Gregoire Canvel is based on that of Humbert Balsan a French film producer who was engulfed by similar travails and its hard to fault the portrait of independent filmmaking that Hansen-Love sketches with its semi-comic scrabbling for funds its crammed offices and its prayerful belief that an audience still exists for the smaller movie. (Needless to say if a film like ""The Father of My Children"" cant reward that faith were finished.) There is no better demonstration of the filmmakers plight than the sight of Gregoire on a flying visit to the Swedish set consoling an actor in period military costume who leans against him with a tale of marital woe. Yet ""The Father of My Children"" is not like ""The Player"" or ""Day for Night"" or ""The Bad and the Beautiful."" You emerge from those works with a delicious sense of having been quietly smuggled backstage and initiated into the cult of an in-joke whereas the business of film as exposed by ""The Father of My Children"" could be any business--anything that seems to nourish our needs but actually eats the soul. In short this is not a movie about movies. It is a movie about the luminous look on Clemences face as she sits in a cafe in suffused morning light too flustered by the night she just spent with a boy to order a cup of coffee; and about the face of her sister Valentine as she bathes in the milky waters of a natural spring on an Italian vacation--a vision of liquid calm except for an undertow of fear and the thought that she could easily slip under like Ophelia in the weeping brook. (Compare Gregoire on the fate of the company ""Were sinking."") It takes a female director I think to catch children young and old at these fragile hours and also to trace a residue of something childlike in their elders. Gregoire recalls ""a house devoid of women"" on a melancholy trip to see his father and the whole film you could say offers motherly--and daughterly--compensation for that loss. Movies are impossible to make and they ruin you but children run and run. The new Michael Douglas film ""Solitary Man"" is heralded over the credits by the song of the same name. It is delivered by Johnny Cash whose voice confirms that pain is on the way. As a description of the movie though the title has no kick to it and it comes muffled with self-pity whereas the daily--and nightly--task of the man whom Douglas plays Ben Kalmen is to be shot of loneliness with a bang. Most of the time he succeeds either by striding forward with a hand outstretched or by firing a smile at any blonde who comes within target range. In happier days when he was married to Nancy (Susan Sarandon) Ben had a string of car dealerships along the Eastern Seaboard--readers of John Updikes ""Rabbit Is Rich"" may feel a twitch here--until being indicted and fined for fraud. Now he has a string of girlfriends headed by Jordan (Mary-Louise Parker) who asks him to accompany her daughter Allyson (Imogen Poots) on a weekend tour of his old college. Not to be picky or anything but is this wise? Asking Ben to chaperone a teen-ager is like asking Shere Khan to babysit gazelles. Thereafter everything unspools. Ben begins to lurch rather than bounce from one folly to the next and the more staunchly he defies his age the more it bites back. Its pretty hard I guess to sleep with the mother of your grandsons school friend and not feel a little older the next morning. The movie was directed by Brian Koppelman and David Levien from Koppelmans neatly ironed screenplay and there are glimmers of mortal beauty to be treasured; one Bergman-like shot of Bens face in a moonlit Mercedes is reminiscent of a death mask. The role is so tailor-made for Douglas who has put in years of screen time on the horizontal that the rest of the story has to fit in around him leaving scant room for maneuver. When Allyson says to Ben ""None of the guys Ive been with really know what theyre doing"" the whole movie seems to be coming on to him begging him to prove his credentials. The makers of ""Wonder Boys"" Douglass finest hour did more to maintain their distance and their patience and ""Solitary Man"" feels a touch small and sour by comparison. That said its litany of character studies is more engaging than most of what you will see this summer--look out for Richard Schiff as a regretful banker and Danny DeVito as the old pal who owns a diner and bears not a single grudge. He and Douglas put their scenes together with no more ado than someone making a sandwich and they leave us with the wry thought that the people the womanizer really loves--the ones he can live with and die with--are guys.

Michael Douglas who has been playing self-destructive middle-aged anti-heroes with great skill since ""Fatal Attraction"" nearly a quarter-century ago is superb as an auto salesman who sinks deeper and deeper into disgrace in ""Solitary Man"" Douglas juiciest vehicle since ""Wonder Boys."" Glimpsed briefly at a life-changing doctors visit six years earlier Ben Kalmen has gone from advertising himself on TV as ""New Yorks honest car dealer"" to being a serially promiscuous 59-year-old convicted felon who cant keep from sabotaging himself in every way imaginable. Thanks to a well-connected girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) hes actually on the verge of a big comeback in the business. But can the talking-talking Ben keep his hands off her seductive daughter (Imogen Poots) whom hes reluctantly agreed to accompany for an interview with the dean at his old college in Boston? Perhaps no more than Ben can keep himself from indulging in a quickie with his daughters friend. But even that diversion doesnt stop the lothario from offering unsolicited romantic advice to Daniel Cheston (the ubiquitous Jesse Eisenberg) a student he meets on the trip. Eventually Bens financial situation becomes so desperate that the former Forbes cover boy is reduced to working at a deli run by an old college buddy (Danny DeVito). Screenwriter Brian Koppelman has provided the excellent cast -- including Susan Sarandon as Bens sympathetic but realistic ex-wife and an unbilled Olivia Thirlby who delivers a great zinger as Chestons girlfriend -- with the sort of smart character-driven dialogue thats in short supply in contemporary films. The film is co-directed without much in the way of visual flourishes by Koppelman and David Levien his longtime writing partner. Levien co-helmed the underrated ""Knockaround Guys"" and wrote ""Oceans Thirteen"" for Steven Soderbergh who serves as a producer here. With a film as well written (at least up to an overly pat ending) and acted as ""Solitary Man"" thats a relatively small complaint. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Glee producers eye Susan Boyle for cameo Read Next Glee producers eye Susan Boyle for cameo Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 47897 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 22877 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 18677 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Solitary Man movie review Michael Douglas excels playing flawed but fascinating character |       NJ.com comments Solitary Man movie review Michael Douglas excels playing flawed but fascinating character Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 21 2010 at 434 AM View/Post Comments Phil CarusoMichael Douglas left shown with Jesse Eisenberg brings depth to his role as the central character in ""Solitary Man.""There are lots of movies about people who make bad choices and their stubborn self-destructiveness drives us crazy. Dont do that we think sitting in our comfortable seats. Dont They do it anyway. And so we wash our hands of them. Michael Douglas plays a character like that in ""Solitary Man"" a 60-ish Manhattanite who has lost his marriage his family and his business -- and whose bad behavior continues to endanger the little he has left. And yet we stick around to watch this guy. Solitary Man (R) Anchor Bay (90 min.) Directed by Brian Koppelman and David Levien. With Michael Douglas. Now playing in New York. Stephen Whittys rating Three and a half starsRating note The film contains sexual situations violence substance abuse and strong language. Thats because directors Brian Koppelman and David Levien have set things up so carefully. In the first scene a flashback we see Douglas character Ben Kalmen chatting to his doctor after a checkup. Then the doctor interrupts with some bad news. But we dont hear the words dont even really see the doctor (played by longtime character actor Bruce Altman). Instead the sound fades away as the camera moves in on Douglas -- and we move into his mind. Its where were going to spend the next hour-and-a-half. Its not a pretty place either. Because after this heart scare Ben Kalmen became determined to act as if he has no heart at all. Actors bring many things to a part including all the other parts theyve played -- on-screen and in their own lives. That Douglas has had a wandering eye in the past that his own familial relationships have been troubled at best is sad public knowledge. Yet somehow -- as smart actors do -- Douglas transforms this baggage into a kind of weight that grounds the character and a depth that lets us see more than just whats on the screen. Were seeing Ben Kalmen up there yes. Yet sometimes it seems were seeing more. Koppelman (who wrote the script) and Levien have collaborated before on screenplays for ""Rounders"" ""Oceans 13"" and ""The Girlfriend Experience""; clearly they have a fondness for stories about inveterate gamblers and addictive high-risk behavior. They take a few risks here themselves. Theres the honest sleaziness of Kalmens character (whose first reprehensible act comes only about 20 minutes in). Theres the camerawork which is unblinking. And theres the story itself which while offering perhaps too pat an explanation provides few excuses and no easy end. This is a modest film and despite some great early reviews it was nearly overlooked at last years Toronto Film Festival (it didnt help that it was screening the same season that ""A Single Man"" and ""A Serious Man"" were monopolizing critics headlines). But actually its closer to another Toronto hit about midlife crises -- ""Up in the Air."" Except unlike George Clooneys constantly in-transit hatchet man Douglas mogul seems to have arrived at his destination. And he has no one to blame but himself.

"Solitary Man | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; solitary-man ) Solitary Man (United States 2009) June 04 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Gordon Gekko lives But then we all know that - Oliver Stone and Michael Douglas have filmed a sequel to Wall Street that is currently sitting on shelves awaiting its late September 2010 release. However Douglas gives us a preview of what an alternate universe Gekko might look like in Solitary Man a character study from Brian Koppelman and David Levien the writers of Oceans 13 and The Girlfriend Experience. Steven Soderberghs fingerprints are all over this one so it should come as no surprise that hes listed as a producer. As recently as 15 years ago Douglas was a bona fide A-list star - a member of Hollywoods elite on-screen and off. Films like Black Rain Wall Street and Basic Instinct cemented his place near the top of the Hollywood pyramid during the 80s and early 90s. But time marches on. It has been more than a decade since Douglas was box office gold. This drift from the spotlight has allowed him to exercise his acting chops in a series of smaller less glitzy roles. Solitary Man is the latest and arguably the most intriguing of these. This also represents a reunion of sorts for Douglas and Danny DeVito whose fingerprints were all over three of the actors high profile 80s productions Romancing the Stone The Jewel of the Nile and The War of the Roses. The only one missing here is Kathleen Turner. Douglas plays Ben the once proud owner of a car dealership empire who has fallen on hard times. When an investigation uncovered illegal practices in his business Ben came down hard. Now hes trying to rebuild his reputation to make another run at the big time but his libido keeps getting in the way. Ben is one of those men who must proposition seemingly every woman he encounters and the repercussions of having sex with his girlfriends teenage daughter Allyson (Imogen Poots) put him in a bad position. There are after all some lines that shouldnt be crossed and this is one of them. Soon the number of people willing to stand up for Ben has dwindled to an alarmingly small club his adult daughter (Jenna Fischer) his ex-wife (Susan Sarandon) an old friend (Danny DeVito) and a young geek (Jesse Eisenberg). But there is a reason for Bens aberrant behavior - one he has been hiding from everyone. Solitary Man develops in a non-sentimental manner the narrative chronicling Bens downward spiral. The film however is not maudlin. Ben may be a sad case but he retains a few shreds of self-respect and does what needs to be done to keep his head above water if just barely (including working at a diner). Theres also a fair amount of humor in the screenplay although much of it is subtle and a little warped. The portrait of Ben painted by Douglas is that of a once-great man who has fallen on hard times as a result of his unquenchable appetites but even in his twilight he cant quite believe he wont make it to the top again. Solitary Man gives Douglas a chance to act not merely posture or show off for the camera. Its some of the finest least forced work he has done in years.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 21 2010 1201 a.m. ET At one point in ""Shrek Forever After"" the amiable hero sees his face on a poster nailed to a tree and says ""Sure is great to be wanted again."" Wanted yes but needed? Not on the strength of this fourth and presumably last installment which is enhanced within reason by 3-D. Having run its course in the third installment the franchise jogs and lurches but mostly meanders through a story that tests the limits of true love (Shreks and ours). The starting point is domesticity which isnt sitting well with Shrek at all. He has a loving wife in Fiona and three cute kidlets (plus of course the benefit of Mike Myerss endearing voice) but hes undone by doing diapers and has fallen victim to the kind of toothless fame that overtook Buffalo Bill. To reclaim his inner ogre Shrek signs a contract with Rumpelstiltskin that makes him an Ogre for a Day. But the contract dramatizes if nothing else the importance of reading the fine print. Before you can say ""Its a Wonderful Life"" Shrek is plunged into an alternate universe where he and Fiona have never met old friends like Eddie Murphys Donkey and Antonio Banderass Puss in Boots dont know him and Fiona voiced appealingly as before by Cameron Diaz has left her castle to assume command of a guerrilla army thats resisting Rumpelstiltskins ruthless rule. Watch the trailer for the movie ""Shrek Forever After."" Video courtesy of Paramount. The film which was directed by Mike Mitchell has its intermittent pleasures toy-like landscapes rendered in enchanting colors; the mysterious charm of Mr. Banderass delivery which gets laughs from every one of his lines; a spell woven by the Pied Pipers flute in a scene reminiscent of the ""Man Piaba"" sequence in ""Beetlejuice""; a witches ball followed by the witches vertiginous pursuit of Shrek through the 3-D spaces of a palace. (Its all too easy to take computer animation for granted until a set piece like that one leaves you absolutely dazzled.) But its important to read the fine print in screenplays too. This one by Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke turns out to be a recycling machine that recalls the high points of previous installments without demonstrating the need for a new one. While theres some suspense in whether Shrek will be able to break Rumpelstilstskins contract with an out clause that posits the power of a loving kiss theres also a sense of filmmakers searching for whatever will help fill the running time. Ninety-three minutes isnt a long time but some of it passes very very slowly. Looking for Eric A string of reservations may not be the best start for an admiring review but I want to get them out of the way so I can concentrate on what I love about Ken Loachs ""Looking for Eric"" which is a lot. The first caveat comes attached to almost every Ken Loach film that plays to American audiences. The accents--mostly Lancashire in this case--demand and sometimes defy concentration. (This film I should note can be seen via video on demand through cable providers as well as in a few big-city theaters.) The second involves a basic plot device you either do or dont buy I bought into it quickly and happily. The third relates to an elaborate climax thats amusing in a strenuously whimsical way but tears the films dramatic fabric to tatters. ENLARGE Steve Evets as Eric Bishop and Eric Cantona as himself in Looking for Eric. IFC Films There you are then. Now let me tell you how stirring the film can be. Its title cuts two ways since Paul Lavertys screenplay involves two Erics. Eric Bishop played with phenomenal intensity by Steve Evets is a postman and soccer fanatic who lost his way three decades ago when he left Lily the young woman he loved; now hes losing it again after crossing paths with her unexpectedly. Eric Cantona played by his suave self is a French-born footballer turned actor though not just any footballer; in real life he achieved mythic status as the star of Manchester United. When the postmans co-workers see how desperate his state is they conspire to cheer him up. Eric seeks more serious guidance or inspiration from the life-size poster of Eric Cantona that occupies a place of honor on his wall and the other Eric responds by appearing magically in the flesh and dispensing life lessons couched in football terms. Thats the basic device and it cuts at least two ways as a witty parody of psychotherapy--""In Treatment"" for the soccer set--and a strangely touching expression of the bond between a worshiper and a benign deity. Quick wit is one quality that makes the film special; another is a tenderness that grows out of the postmans grief--one of his stepsons is helping to make his life a living hell--and the depth of his love for Lily who is played beautifully in the present by Stephanie Bishop. ""Looking for Eric"" is a daring and unstable melange of styles--working-class realism deadpan fantasy shameless buffoonery. At times it falls flat or fails to rise. More often than not though its a heartbreaker. In Brief ENLARGE Michael Douglas and Susan Sarandon in Solitary Man. Anchor Bay Films ""Solitary Man"" stars Michael Douglas as a vulgar womanizer--a girlizer really--and a serial lecher who uses sex to avoid the twin terrors of mortality (his heart could be a lot healthier) and personal failure (he sabotaged his career as a supersuccessful car dealer). The movie which was written by Brian Koppelman and directed by Mr. Koppelman and David Levien seems to view its antihero Ben Kalmen as a kind of upscale Willy Loman. Yet hes so dislikable and Mr. Douglass performance is so devoid of any saving nuance that you may wonder why the young women Ben hits on and the passive young man he befriends (played by Jesse Eisenberg) dont tell the aging creep to buzz off the moment he opens his mouth. ""Solitary Man"" intends to be shocking and has been rewarded with some respectful reviews. But ticket buyer beware--the films real shocker is its unpleasantness. ""Holy Rollers"" is a debut feature directed by Kevin Asch. This time Jesse Eisenberg stars as Shmuel a.k.a. Sam a young Hasidic Jew who thanks to restless ambition and boundless naivete becomes a drug courier smuggling ecstasy from Europe into the U.S. The film is said to have been inspired by a true story but the inspiration was insufficient even though Mr. Asch has a strong sense of place and displays a confident touch with some of the action sequences. The screenplay by Antonio Macia is earnest and unsurprising--not a good combination--and neither the director nor the star quite knows what to make of the quirky character inside the traditional garments that signal otherworldly innocence to customs agents. DVD Focus Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) The first Wallace amp; Gromit full-length feature a charming film from the British production team at Aardman never caught on in this country to the extent that it deserved. This time the Claymation buddies are humane pest-control experts; their company ""Anti-Pesto"" deals with a plague of rabbits by vacuuming up the little hoppers and giving them room and board. The plot such as it is confronts two problems where to keep all the rabbits and how to keep more rabbits from ravaging the produce in a Giant Vegetable Competition hosted by Lady Tottington who is voiced by Helena Bonham Carter. The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006) Cillian Murphy is Damien a young physician turned guerrilla fighter after being radicalized by the brutality of British troops in the thatched-roof Ireland of 1920. The director Ken Loach and his writer Paul Laverty are unsparing in their portrait of the Black and Tans and the ruthless violence that the Republicans visit on Britains forces. Most painful of all is the spectacle of Irish revolutionists fighting Irish turncoats. ""I studied anatomy for five years and now Im going to shoot this guy in the head"" Damien says in horror and anguish. Then the physician turned guerrilla turns executioner. Maria Full of Grace (2004) A debut feature by Joshua Marston this harrowing film centers on Maria a young woman in Colombia who becomes a drug mule and flies to New York at mortal risk with heroin-filled pellets in her stomach. Shes played by Catalina Sandino Moreno a young actress trained in her native Colombia who brings flawless though mainly invisible technique to her first movie role. The drama is detailed and suspenseful though the process through which Maria learns to swallow those deadly pellets is almost too awful to watch. Mr. Marston is a natural dramatist and better still an adventurous one. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump New Sandy Hook Elementary School to Open Soon Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Michael Douglas deserves serious award attention for his triumphant performance as the tormented Ben Kalmen a fast-talking moneymaking New York car dealer facing professional and personal disasters. His method of warding off aging job scandal and a heart problem is to screw women the younger the better. That includes Allyson (Imogen Poots) the college-age daughter of his mistress (Mary-Louise Parker). His own daughter (Jenna Fischer) has given up on him as has his ex-wife Nancy (Susan Sarandon). He fares better with student Daniel Cheston (Jesse Eisenberg) schooling him on the art of seduction until even the kid sees Bens methods are outmoded. Yet when Ben hits bottom working the counter at the diner of a friend (a terrific Danny DeVito) he cant quit lying to himself. The screenplay by Brian Koppelman who co-directed with David Levien (Knockaround Guys) is a model of acid wit and elusive wisdom. The bumps in the narrative can be jarring but Douglas never makes a false move delivering a tour de force in human weakness.

(Handout) Joe Neumaier Thursday May 20 2010 252 PM Title Solitary Man A New York car dealer makes a mess of his life. With Michael Douglas Susan Sarandon. Directors Brian Koppelman and David Levien (129) R Language. At the Angelika the Beekman Lincoln Plaza.Watching an old pro hawk his wares can be seductive and Ben Kalman the broken-down New York auto dealership owner played by Michael Douglas in ""Solitary Man"" has all the tools of the man who plays him at his disposal. At times in this often engaging occasionally meandering movie thats enough to score.The problem is that Ben is having a vague health crisis that hes dealing with by embracing a second adolescence so as with most movie characters going through middle-aged maladjustment Ben is doomed to get a rude awakening and a dose of second chance-itis. Inevitably it makes for a story thats too easy even for a smoothie like Ben who tells people what they want to hear.Though nearing 60 Ben sees every co-ed as a conquest and every day a chance to mess up more opportunities. His ex-wife Nancy (Susan Sarandon) is used to him by now and their married daughter Susan (Jenna Fischer) enables him letting Ben come over and vent about his gal trouble. Meanwhile Bens girlfriend a fortyish society layabout (Mary Louise Parker) insists Ben take her daughter Allyson (Imogen Poots) to Boston for a college interview.A blind man could see thats an awful idea and Ben makes good on his bad reputation sleeping with Allyson before he reconnects with an old pal (Danny De Vito) and gives life advice to an undergrad (Jesse Eisenberg). As for himself hes living in avoidance since Bens business like his health and his family is hurtling toward rock bottom.None of this is a revelation but thats okay since like the similar superior ""Wonder Boys"" - the 2000 charmer in which Douglas played a dissolute writer - ""Solitary Man"" is a movie about watching a guy spin his wheels while figuring things out. Douglas has that down pat selling us the best smarm money can buy and his scenes with DeVito Parker and Sarandon are perfect dances of evasion and acceptance. The mentoring moments with Eisenberg are more obvious and its a leap to think Ben might be an attraction for the 18-year-old Allyson.Directors Brian Koppelman and David Levien working from Koppelmanss script almost incidentally capture how losing a kind of New York glamour would effect a person like Ben - essentially even more than a glimpse of death. ""Solitary Man"" was filmed at the end of 08 so Ben provides a hint of recessionary things to come but that link of course is never pushed. In Douglass capable hands hes merely a wreck trying to look carefree instead of careworn and failing beautifully.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres enough material for three movies in Brian Koppelman and David Leviens Solitary Man but only two of those movies are any good. The not-so-good one--the one that dominates--is the story of a rogue angling for a renaissance. Michael Douglas plays a disgraced divorced car dealer trying to get his business back in order while scoring with every young lady in his immediate vicinity. This is the fussy script-driven Solitary Man an overwritten drama stuffed with too many stars (including Susan Sarandon as Douglas wife Jenna Fischer as his daughter Danny DeVito as his old friend and Mary-Louise Parker as his long-suffering lover) and structured so that nearly every scene reveals bits of Douglas backstory as obliquely as possible. Handled well this approach to narrative can be effective--more show than tell just like the seminars preach--but when its obvious whats going on the gears grind audibly. The second movie nestled within Solitary Man--the one that doesnt show up often enough--is about a man of rare eloquence and honesty sharing his views on salesmanship and sex with anyone wholl listen. The film opens with Douglas being told about an irregularity on his EKG which he decides not to investigate choosing instead to live his life as though he could die at any moment. He shows a college student (Jesse Eisenberg) the ropes of romance then tries to steal the kids girlfriend. He tries to swing big business deals in spite of his bad reputation. He speaks his mind and wields his expertise and hes fun to watch even as hes driving away everyone he ever loved. Which brings us to the third movie--the one that balances the problems of the first. This is Solitary Man the star vehicle offering Douglas in layered charmer mode fully aware that his lack of impulse control is sabotaging his attempts at a career comeback (meant to be financed by Parker) as well as his shaky family ties yet unable to stop himself from seizing every available opportunity. For the most part A Solitary Man is a needlessly sly movie about the kind of problems that preoccupy people in show business--becoming sexually undesirable not spending enough time with the kids etc.--but Douglas makes all the contrivances feel like universal soul-testing dilemmas. He encourages the audience to lean in and watch him close to pick up a few tips on how to look cool while melting down.

Douglas portrays Ben Kalmen a New York player gone to seed and divorced from a good mature woman (Susan Sarandon equally revitalized). Hes squandering the love of his adult daughter (Jenna Fischer superb). And hes compulsively chasing inappropriate women -- some as young as the college-age daughter (Imogen Poots) of his girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker). With an outstanding screenplay by Brian Koppelman and disciplined direction by Koppelman and David Levien a story that could have been generic (or worse scented with flowery bulls--) turns into a precise honest and affecting drama. And recognizing the gift of such a character Douglas does Ben Kalmen the honor of playing him exactly as he lies.

Sure his most iconic role Wall Streets Gordon ""Greed is good"" Gekko is the embodiment of an eras excessive success. But the 65-year-old movie star really seems engaged only when portraying destroyed defeated men. You can keep your repentant husbands and righteous heroes; wed much rather take his downward-spiraling spouse in The War of the Roses and his unraveling college professor in Wonder Boys a peerless take on muddled middle-aged white-guy malaise. He knows how to turn losers into beautifully tarnished gold. Add Solitary Mans Ben Kalmen to his greatest-shits gallery. Once this car-dealership magnate had it all a loving family booming lots the world by the cajones. Then Kalmens doctor gives him a scare--those EKG results seem odd--and poof Faced with his mortality this former golden boy leaves a trail of pathetic philandering broken promises and dodgy business deals in his wake. A compulsive seduction of his girlfriends teenage daughter (Poots) seals Kalmens fate; soon even admirers like a nerdy college student (the ubiquitous Eisenberg; see story) tire of his hedonistic immaturity. Watching the way Douglas bounces his curdled caddish charm against a well-chosen cast (Danny DeVito Susan Sarandon Mary-Louise Parker Jenna Fischer) you can almost forgive how directors Brian Koppelman and David Levien fall short of turning this into Wonder Boys Redux. Its neither the final word nor the most eloquent statement on the evil that broken men do. It is however a truly impressive portrait of self-destructive smooth-talking alpha males and a testament to an actor who waltzes across that Peter Pan--syndrome tightrope with the greatest of sleaze.--David Fear Watch the trailer More new Film reviews Posted Monday May 17 2010 Details Release details Cast and crew Users say LiveReviews|01 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew ReviewsRefreshShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/film/85840/solitaryman,200,solitaryman21,solitaryman,timeout

After a prologue set six and a half years ago shows thriving car-dealership owner and loyal husband Ben Kalmen (Douglas) being told by his doctor that theres an irregularity in his EKG the film returns to the present with the damage of his mortality scare already done. Divorced from college sweetheart Susan Sarandon and his business ruined Ben is free to continue his pathetic behavior bedding girlfriend Mary Louise Parkers 18-year-old daughter and asking his own daughter Susan (Jenna Fischer the most revelatory of the crowded hardworking supporting cast) for rent money. Koppelmans script contains some tart dialogue about deluded middle-aged male vanity--""Give me a hug so people will think were married"" Ben tells Susan--and the film courageously shows its reprobate hero sliding further not redeeming himself. ""The men who live like Ben Kalmen all model themselves after characters Michael has played"" Koppelman says in the press notes--and the lead is all too content not to stretch himself beyond playing a copy of a copy of a copy.

For a story about a guy who keeps disappointing the people he loves ""Solitary Man"" is a movie of no small generosity It offers audiences the pleasures of a screenplay whose every acerbic line is firmly rooted in character and it hands Michael Douglas one of his best roles in years. And the actor more than returns the favor delivering a dryly funny turn as a bull-spouting skirt-chasing ex-businessman having a late-in-life family/career meltdown. While it plows familiar coming-of-old-age terrain this sharply etched ensemble dramedy is an unassuming winner that should parlay cast names into modest arthouse returns. Pic reps a polished sophomore feature for helmers Brian Koppelman and David Levien eight years after their debut ""Knockaround Guys."" The duos scripting credits include ""Rounders"" ""Runaway Jury"" and two films (""Oceans Thirteen"" ""The Girlfriend Experience"") directed by Steven Soderbergh credited as a producer here. A prologue introduces Ben (Douglas) aka ""New Yorks honest car dealer"" as he receives some unsettling medical news. Six and a half years later hes about to turn 60 and still going strong though much has happened since that fateful doctors visit. Corporate malfeasance has liquidated his auto business; philandering has ended his marriage to Nancy (Susan Sarandon); and chronic unreliability is threatening his relationships with his daughter (Jenna Fischer) and her young son. Bens current g.f. (Mary-Louise Parker) asks him to accompany her college-bound daughter Allyson (Imogen Poots) to his alma mater so he can pull a few strings with the dean. While on campus Ben is very much in his element offering techniques on how to score to nerdy sophomore Cheston (Jesse Eisenberg); visiting an old school chum (Danny DeVito) whos had a less illustrious but more stable life; and sparring verbally with Allyson a thorny headstrong type who nonetheless proves receptive to Bens often provocative advice. What happens next is at once logical and surprising and Koppelman spins out the ensuing ramifications in a series of fraught one-on-one conversations between Ben and the characters weve met so far. Through it all Ben remains a gregarious smooth-talker boasting of his business savvy and pragmatic approach to relationships even as his power-player facade begins to crumble and he starts to need money as well as emotional support. Fortunately Koppelmans bracing script presents Bens friends family members and sympathetic strangers as smart strong-minded individuals in their own right more than capable of seeing through his blather and calling him on it when necessary. While their protags gradual descent is tightly constructed the helmers make meaningful use of silences dissolves and occasional downtime allowing scenes and relationships to breathe even as the noose tightens around Bens neck. If the last scene bookends the first one a bit too glibly the filmmakers are honest enough to avoid easy resolutions yet wise enough to extend hope. Douglas tosses off every self-serving pronouncement and phony promise with silver-tongued relish without chewing the scenery in a characterization that fits neatly into the actors gallery of oily corporate rogues (""Wall Street"" ""Disclosure"") even as it serves as something of an implicit rebuke. Although Douglas appears in every scene he never overpowers his co-stars and the script gratifyingly doesnt let him monopolize the good lines. British actress Poots (""28 Weeks Later"") who resembles both Kate Winslet and Scarlett Johansson is a knockout in every sense and reps Douglas most satisfying opponent here with sterling pros DeVito and Sarandon running a close second. Fischer and Eisenberg movingly embody younger types who because they see Ben as a father figure are more susceptible to emotional wounds. Olivia Thirlby shines in a late-breaking role as Chestons g.f. Alwin Kuchlers cinematography is functional yet elegant acquiring a darker moodier cast as Bens journey dictates.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Come Back Errol Flynn Ridley Scotts Robin Hood steals from a rich legacy while ripping off poor moviegoers. _ By David Edelstein Published May 17 2010 ShareThis (Photo David Appleby/Courtesy of Universal Pictures) Ridley Scotts Robin Hood is a pompous interminable hash. Billed as a precursor to the legend we know its rich in bogus historical context along with enough mud blood and clutter to overwhelm our happy memories of Errol Flynns grin and Olivia de Havillands radiance. Here Robin and Marian are played by a scowling Russell Crowe and a grim Cate Blanchett who has the face of a wooden squaw stained by decades of cigar smoke. I cant remember a more un-fun-looking couple. Scott convinced he has much to say about oppression and social justice presents a Robin who returns from the Crusades with post-traumatic-stress disorder after helping to slaughter tens of thousands of guiltless Muslims and goes on to write the Magna Carta. In between he travels to Nottingham and informs Marian of her husbands death. Amid all the gritty mucky barnyard realism Blanchett receives the bad news with a mask of stoicism turns away from Crowe totters puts a fluttery hand to her heart and promptly regains her composure. Its Blanche DuBois Goes Medieval. Crowe follows this spectacle by taking a bath which allows the newly single Blanchett to behold him in his jiggly splendor. While the aging stars grit their teeth and pretend to be sweet on each other a bald French spy affecting an English accent pushes King John to tax his subjects so ruthlessly that the French will be able to cruise across the Channel and plate escargot by suppertime. In a Ridley Scott film war is hellon the eyes and ears. He jams together disparate whackings and hackings and uses a flickery quasi-slow-motion as if he thinks it will smooth out the gaps in continuity. If his aim is to deglamorize battle he misses the most vital component of humanism to present the dead as individuals instead of anonymous founts of CGI gore. As in Gladiator it all comes down to righteous vengeance. Robin leads the Saxons against the French pig-dogs who skewered Max von Sydow as Marians blind father-in-lawa cause we embrace because Von Sydow alone among the hams seems to be having a good time. The first printed verse to refer to the figure of Robin Hood (who probably existed) is this from the thirteenth or fourteenth century Lithe and Lysten gentylmen / That be of frebore blode I shall tell of a good yeman / His name was Robyn Hode / Robyn was a proude outlawe / Whyles he walked on grounde / So curteyse an outlawe as he was one / Was never none found. Read it out loud. It has the swing the panache of the FlynnMichael Curtiz production of The Adventures of Robin Hood in all its goofy Technicolor romanticism. Heres an example of Ridley Scotts modern revisionist sensibility Waiting for the Frenchies to land Robin throws open the visor of a suspiciously effeminate soldier For the love of God Marian Undeterred Marian flings herself on the bald Frenchman who murdered Von Sydow and then (just like a girl) tumbles into the surf and requires rescue. This allows Crowe to emit the slow-motion cry of rage NooooOOOOOOHHHHH Before the bad guy can finish off Marian he charges knocks the blackguard over appears to get caught between two boats (its hard to follow the action) then sees his foe fleeing on horseback NooooOOOOOOHHHHH A moment later he carries the stunned Marian up the beach in his arms neglecting to remove her layers of armor and chain mail beforehand. Its fun to think of what happened after that the pain in Crowes groin his realization that he has just given himself an inguinal hernia and his cry when Scott yells Cut NooooOOOOOOHHHHH Its too bad Robert Eisenberg used the name Boychiks in the Hood for his excellent book about Hasidic life because Kevin Aschs Holy Rollersinspired by the story of Hasidic Jews recruited in the nineties to serve as mules for bringing Ecstasy into the countrycould use a snazzier title. It could use more sex and violence too although theres only so much you can do with a story that ends not with carnage but some jail time and brokenhearted bubbes. The congenitally high-strung Jesse Eisenberg plays 20-year-old Brooklyn black-hat Sam Gold whos starting to chafe under Orthodoxys restrictions especially when the family of the girl he wants to marry nixes him in favor of someone more scholarly. (On their one and only datesitting on opposite sides of the sofashe says she wants eight kids. And the poor sap is still torn up about losing her) Sam is easy pickings for his neighbor Yosef (Justin Bartha) whos like a Hasidic Honest John in Pinocchio Hey pssst kid yeah you with the payis  Yosef is great because he says fuck a lot and talks about sex. And by and by Sam discovers hes pretty good at managing Hasidic couriers and likes being fondled by a badass Israeli drug dealers dyed-blonde Jewish moll (Ari Graynor). On the other hand he feels shame when his bearded father looks up from the Torah and sees My Son the Drug Mule. 1 2 Next Share this story...
