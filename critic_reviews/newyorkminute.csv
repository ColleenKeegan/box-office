In this film they present opposing personas Ashleys the rebellious chick who bunks off school and plays drums; Mary-Kates the prissy academic one. By some weird quirk of fate the sisters find themselves embroiled in a cross-country chase involving a missing computer chip a record piracy outfit a truancy officer and an annoying dog. And thats it. It wants to be funny but isnt while the plots a compendium of improbable occurrences.

Pictures action comedy ""New York Minute."" (AP Photo/ Warner Bros. Pictures) Ashley Olsen and Mary-Kate Olsen star in Warner Bros. Pictures action comedy ""New York Minute."" (AP Photo/ Warner Bros. Pictures) Olsen twins have lots to do -- and fashion to spare -- in glib gallop through Manhattan 1 / 1 Back to Gallery New York Minute Teen comedy. Starring Mary-Kate Olsen Ashley Olsen Andy Richter and Eugene Levy. Directed by Dennie Gordon. (PG. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The energetic Olsen twins emulated by millions of teenage girls are incrementally transitioning from the small screen to the super-size one. ""New York Minute"" in which Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen play Roxy and Jane Ryan  falls somewhere between a home video and a full-blown movie. At this point I should tell you which Olsen twin is which Ryan twin but thats like deciphering which twin has the Toni. One thing you can say for ""New York Minute"" -- it lives up to its title flying by in fast motion. Even the first-wave MTV generation may find the pace exhausting but this piece of fluff wasnt made for them. The intended audience is closer to the age of the films 17-year-old stars. In the course of a single day Roxy and Jane crisscross Manhattan in a variety of vehicles and on foot among the citys sewer pipes. They whoop it up at a rock concert smash a video piracy ring deliver a speech fall in love and resolve their sibling rivalry. Ah to be young again. Related Stories Olsens Minute is an exhausting romp through Manhattan Jane is hyper serious as opposed to her wayward twin differences that would seem to take more than a day to resolve especially considering timeouts to change into 10 color-coordinated outfits. This impressive fashion show -- loved the thigh-high yellow boots -- may be a reminder that the Olsens entrepreneurial empire includes a clothing line. With their pouty mouths and blossoming sexuality Ashley and Mary-Kate are turning into Angelina Jolie clones surely a disturbing sight for fans who remember them as toddlers on ""Full House."" The Olsen girls can hold the screen but that there are two of them could hamper their movie careers. A limited number of scripts are written for twins and CGI effects make it simple for one actor to assay both roles. The two may soon find themselves competing for parts leaving room for only one to emerge as the diva the same way Diana Ross became the supreme Supreme. Despite the Olsens domination of ""New York Minute"" Andy Richter and Eugene Levy steal every one of their scenes. Richter plays a lackey for the proprietress of a Chinese restaurant which she maintains as a front for her piracy operation. To get on her good side he pretends to be Asian channeling Mickey Rooney in ""Breakfast at Tiffanys."" That Richter pulls off this broken- English routine without becoming offensive is a credit to his comic skill. Levy is another actor with funny bones not to mention a funny face. Here hes truant officer Lomax who pursues the delinquent Roxy with the zeal of Tommy Lee Jones in ""The Fugitive."" Lomax is given to grand pronouncements like ""I dont use handcuffs just brains"" right before he lets his prey slip away. Director Dennie Gordon who made the underrated ""What a Girl Wants"" uses Manhattan to great effect. The city dazzles even as it whizzes by. Gordon also seems to understand high school girls which I attribute to her having been one. Roxy and Janes romantic entanglements underplayed as they are have the feel of actual teenage crushes. Screenwriters Emily Fox Adam Cooper and Bill Collage seem to take a page from the 30s romantic comedies that hinged on the travails of motherless girls. The Ryan sisters have recently lost their Mom causing their paths to diverge. Audiences could potentially connect with an issue as emotional as a death in the family. But the superficial way it is presented makes it impossible to feel anything except relief when ""New York Minutes"" time is up.

"Olsen Twins Rush to Grow Up In Skimpy New York Minute washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Olsen Twins Rush to Grow Up In Skimpy New York Minute Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 7 2004 ""New York Minute"" the hectic headache-inducing theatrical feature debut of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen features Americas favorite sisters as good and evil twins. (Okay its the Olsens Maybe not evil just less good.) Jane played by Ashley is an aspiring College Republican who resembles a young blond overachieving version of Mary Matalin with a bigger makeup allowance. Roxy (Mary-Kate) her hair dyed a more authority-questioning darker shade dresses in Metallica T-shirts and idolizes Avril Lavigne. The only gene she seems to share with her sister is the one for cosmetic dependence. The movie is supposed to be a family action comedy about the high jinks of two spirited high schoolers run amok in Manhattan. At the end of the day -- actually one very very long day -- ""New York Minute"" is a portrait of two performers navigating the difficult journey from child stars to tween cult figures to adult actresses. The spectacle is a strained one as the 17-year-old Olsen twins -- who are reportedly gazillionaires several times over thanks to past TV series merchandising and a string of straight-to-video hits -- demand to be accepted as both wholesome girls next door and Lolita-like objects worthy of a thousand Maxim covers. The effect isnt just frenetic unfunny and dull. Its kind of creepy. Jane and Roxy its established early in the film have lost their mother in the past few years and live with their dad somewhere in the Long Island suburbs. On the day in question Jane is due to deliver a big speech at Columbia University where she will apply for a fellowship to Oxford. Roxy on the other hand skips school to go to a music video shoot for the band Simple Plan. The two wind up sharing a ride into Manhattan and through plot devices that can stand about as much close scrutiny as the average popcorn carb count they become embroiled in a series of madcap escapades. (Or at least the director Dennie Gordon wants you to think theyre madcap; hence her overuse of frantic cross-cutting split screens and other distractions from whats not going on up on the screen.) Through it all they are being pursued by an obsessed truant officer (Eugene Levy) a Javert to the nose-thumbing Roxys Jean Valjean. As Jane and Roxy chase through the mismatched patchwork of New York landmarks (is that the Plaza cater-cornered from the Flatiron Building?) usually in five-inch heels they cross paths with any number of comedic actors who like them are most familiar from their work on television. Andy Richter plays the adopted son of a Chinese gang leader whose microchip of pirated music finds its way into Roxys bag; Andrea Martin plays a U.S. senator whose ugly little dog comes to play a crucial role in getting the chip back; Darrell Hammond plays a businessman who coincidentally keeps meeting the girls often with disastrous results. Even Bob Saget who played the Olsen twins father in their first show ""Full House"" has a cameo as a pedestrian who ogles the two as they teeter barely clad across Times Square. Thats just one of several teasing moments in ""New York Minute"" in which the Olsens -- whose fan base like that of Britney Spears consists of pre-pubescent girls and very post-pubescent boys -- address their contradictory personas. The film opens with a sequence in which Jane dreams shes delivering her speech nude; throughout the rest of the movie no opportunity is missed to put one or both of the girls in situations where clothes are doffed or at least reduced in their coverage. (Okay its the Olsens The frontal nudity is always kept coyly off camera.) At one point Jane is lolling sensually on a hotel bed in a terry cloth robe while Roxy walks into the room with a towel wrapped around her shaking her just-washed hair in slow motion; when the rooms rightful owner walks in he blurts out ""Is it my birthday?"" What ensues is a nearly naked chase through New York one that after yet another costume change winds up in Harlem where Jane and Roxy receive a ghetto-fabulous makeover (thigh-high boots and stilettos anyone?). It will surprise no one that ""New York Minute"" ends happily with Jane winning the day at Columbia and Roxy making her rock-and-roll dreams come true -- all the time looking like pint-size versions of Lady Marmalade. ""New York Minute"" wont do much to damage the Olsen twins vast cultural empire; its far too late for that. But its still kind of creepy. New York Minute (86 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mild sensuality and thematic elements.

"The Olsens suffer growing pains in New York Minute - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW The Olsens suffer growing pains in New York Minute By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  May 7 2004 Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen might be the only thing tweenage girls have in common with their brothers and fathers. Its an uncomfortable you might say unholy bond whose spectacular bizarreness is open to interpretation this weekend in ""New York Minute"" the Olsens first Hollywood outing and the first movie in some years where parental guidance isnt merely a suggestion for some men its cause for celebration. The movies no good Its written directed performed photographed edited and marketed on a fifth-grade reading level; despite that and its twin stars saucer eyes and ropy limbs its no Muppet movie either. (Never mind that the twins do take Manhattan.)""New York Minute"" is a romp about two Long Island sisters who wind up on a silly Big Apple adventure. Jane (Ashley) is the uptight overachiever. Shes bound for Oxford and has entered a speechmaking competition held at Columbia University. Roxy (Mary-Kate) is the bad-girl slacker. To Janes consternation she hops on the train too. Roxys mission is to crash a music video shoot and give the Aamp;R guys her bands demo. (Not to take this Muppets thing too far but like Animal Roxy is a rambunctious drummer.)Things just are wildly overwritten from there. Somebody plants a computer chip on one of the girls. A big meanie (Andy Richter) wants the chip. Jane leaves her day planner in the meanies limo. He holds the planner hostage until the chip is returned. The dog of a senator (Andrea Martin) eats the chip. (Dont ask.) So Jane has to wait for the pooch to relieve itself -- while running from the blond blue-eyed meanie who thinks hes Chinese. This says nothing of the senators son (Jared Padalecki) whos in love with Roxy; the bike messenger (Riley Smith) who keeps bumping into Jane; the truancy officer (Eugene Levy) stalking Roxy; the fact that the chips rightful owner is a Chinese dragon-lady type (Alannah Ong) who intends to use it for pirating DVDs and compact discs; or that awful trip to the ""House of Bling"" a Harlem beauty salon. (The movie is replete with insane conspiratorial ideas about blacks and Asians.)Yet its all delivered in a manner enjoyable to any girl who has ransacked her local Wal-Mart for Mary-Kate and Ashley brand hairbrushes perfumes or ""optical frames"" -- do they even wear glasses? -- or for copies of their TV movies or television shows. But for those not part of the Olsen industrial complex ""New York Minute"" often feels creepy and lecherous like it was made by a family ""uncle.""The director actually is Dennie Gordon a woman and prolific television director and it must be said that shes distressingly good about pleasing more than one audience. The movie is a double fantasy. The Olsens are surrounded by men who appeal to other men Ozzy Osbournes ill-behaved son Jack for instance is Roxys manager and the sex expert Dr. Drew Pinsky has been cast as their father. The film is fully furnished with shots of its young stars giddily running around Times Square in towels and bathrobes. In a cameo their ""Full House"" dad Bob Saget has the good sense to flash them a disgusted look. Still Mary-Kates linens come off after the girls tumble into a Dumpster. (Who said there were no metaphors?)The Olsens who are scheduled to turn 18 next month are also soaked more than once and do a lot of spatting only to make up in subsequent scenes which is certainly sweet. By the end of the picture theyre gazing lovingly into each others eyes and holding each other awkwardly close. The girls around me cooed with delight. The men giggled almost in guilt like boys caught with a copy of Stuff or Maxim. They were in a curious spot particularly the ones who sat through this dinky movie unaccompanied by a daughter. They couldnt possibly have shown up for the articles.

It also features the ugliest movie dog in history. One is tempted to re-cry ""Lassie come home"" but then lassies are not the problem here. (Related clip Take a moment to watch New York Minute) New York Minute is the last film that these two will release before theyre adults. Warner Bros. Even more insipid than youd guess Minute is infrequently made bearable by the cutie-quotient of its richer-than-sin leads who no longer want to be called the Olsen twins. This is presumably because each strives here for a distinctive characterization. Ashleys Jane wears dainty pink and glasses; Mary-Kates Roxy is tomboy-sexy pounding her drums and cutting school. Jane and Roxy are uh twins. The resulting ""day in the life of"" comedy tells what happens when the two meet up with the dog a couple of hunks a female senator a rock-video production crew funky hair-cutters plus hold on Eugene Levy. ABOUT THE MOVIE New York Minute   (out of four) Stars Ashley Olsen Mary-Kate Olsen Eugene Levy Andrea Martin Andy Richter Director Dennie Gordon Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for mild sensuality and thematic elements. Opens Friday nationwide As a truant officer Levy is possibly intended to attract the raunchier American Pie audience though Minute is more like American Dairy Products with a heavy emphasis on American cheese. But the movie is a bit of a tease when it gets one Olsen in a bathrobe and another wrapped in a towel each apparently Crazy-Glued on during maybe 10 New York minutes of outdoor chases. As far as acting goes neither Olsen is ready for Euripides Medea yet each projects well enough in their shared big scene when they vent their spleens about their mutual dissatisfaction with each other. This comes around the time they sing Itsy-Bitsy Spider. In any event you always know itll all work out in the end -- and that Jane will attain her dream of getting to Oxford where in another life she might have met Bill Clinton. Uh-oh.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (New York Minute Rafy) D New York Minute Genre Comedy; Starring Ashley Olsen Mary-Kate Olsen Darrell Hammond Eugene Levy Andrea Martin Jack Osbourne Jared Padalecki Andy Richter Riley Smith; Director Dennie Gordon; Author Adam Cooper Emily Fox William Collage; Release Date Wide 05/07/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 85; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted May 5 2004 -- 1200 AM EDT Coverage of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen who at the age of 17 are like SO OVER being called the Olsen twins inevitably focuses on the business empire built around the identical sisters with the blank ""manga"" eyes and mall-rat ""Teen People"" polish. Theyre actresses theyre producers theyve got their own fashion label they sell videos CDs cosmetics and for all I know theyre developing a theme park and a line of low-carb snacks. And now with New York Minute the Olsens add Hollywood theatrical movie to their catalog of industrial products focusing on talent individuation as a branding objective. Sugarless gum has been marketed with more wit. In this PowerPoint presentation from director Dennie Gordon Ashley plays blond-streaked 17-year-old Long Island overachiever Jane Ryan opposite Mary-Kate as her rebellious twin sister Roxy with extensive wardrobe changes conveying what the script by Adam Cooper and Bill Collage cannot. For ease of movement the girls are given a dead mother and a vague father (TV ""addictologist"" Dr. Drew Pinsky) whose approach to dealing with the glittery look-dont-touch sexuality of his pubescent daughters appears to be ""Oops late for work gotta go."" The manufactured mayhem involves a speech at Columbia University (for Jane) and a Simple Plan video shoot (for Roxy) interrupted by stale mishaps exposing Andy Richter Andrea Martin and Eugene Levy among other bamboozled adult costars. In keeping with the sense of time compression for which the city is famous ""New York Minute"" flits restlessly all over NYC chasing after the Olsens and the fruit of their curling irons. In one striking shot the sisters fake-squabble at an angle that frames the magnificent Flatiron Building - a shining skyscraper when it was completed in 1903. The movie may be more bogus than a Gucci bag for sale on a Fifth Avenue sidewalk but at least the backgrounds are real.

Loud and annoying pic seems destined to connect with part of its teen/young girl audience. Only the Olsens brand prevents ""New York Minute"" from disappearing about that fast. Few entertainment phenomena are as perplexing to the uninitiated as the commercial juggernaut that is the Olsen twins and their first major feature foray certainly doesnt help decipher it. Yes the girls are getting older -- their fast-approaching 18th birthday is cause for celebration in darker quadrants of the Internet -- but after a string of direct-to-video excursions this latest film remains an off-putting assault of too-screwball comedy with glints of pathos. Loud and annoying pic seems destined to connect with part of its teen/young girl audience in theaters but primarily in ancillary life with only the Olsens brand preventing ""New York Minute"" from disappearing about that fast. A lot of veteran comedy actors with ""Saturday Night Live"" or ""SCTV"" credentials lend their names to this nonsense but dont be fooled theyre simply pocketing checks. The most aggravating part involves Andy Richter as a white guy adopted by Asians who affects a bad Fu Manchu accent which would be more offensive if it werent so amateurish. To paraphrase another memorable sidekick Help Conan help The plot such as it is involves a mismatched set of twins with a dead mom and absentee dad (radio host Dr. Drew Pinsky who one would think could at least offer teen-sex advice). Buttoned-up and conservative Jane (Ashley) has a big speech to deliver in New York hoping to land a scholarship abroad at Oxford while slacker Roxy (Mary-Kate) simply wants to cut class -- again -- and attend a concert. Jane winds up being pursued by Richters DVD-pirating buffoon who needs a computer chip thats been planted on her. As for Roxy her Javert is a truant officer (poor Eugene Levy) patterned after the principal in ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" -- though the target audience can hardly be expected to remember a film released the year that the Olsen franchise was born. That the two will not only repair their relationship but both acquire boyfriends in roughly 90 minutes goes without saying though any parent unfortunate enough to follow kids into the theater will wish they had gone without watching. The revelation here if there is one is that the two do look more mature which might account for the several scenes of implied nakedness and an extended sequence in which they run through New York City clad only in a bathrobe and towel. Dennie Gordon -- a well-traveled episodic TV director whose features credits include the Amanda Bynes teen pic ""What a Girl Wants"" -- employs lots of zooming camerawork and music attempting to create a kind of frenetic energy which has become almost a prerequisite for such fare. Its ironic in that context that the few worthwhile moments involve the girls quietly talking about why their interaction soured -- a big improvement over the stereophonic shrillness that accompanies most of their zany antics. Indeed at times this feels like an all-live-action version of the Warner Bros. flop ""Looney Tunes Back in Action"" with the Olsens as Daffy and Bugs. The cameo roster also includes Jack Osbourne and the punk pop band Simple Plan though theres little here to shake off the squeaky-clean image that the Olsens have cultivated. Its worth noting too that they again share producing credit as they have practically since the duo was old enough to gum food capitalizing on their inexplicably wild popularity thanks to ABCs ""Full House."" Having grown up onscreen the Olsens are preparing to attend college which seems as good a time as any to contemplate a logical next act. Because if there are any certainties about prepubescent girls one is that they will invariably move on to newer models once their existing heroines begin to outgrow them. Whatever the future holds during the calmer exchange the twins actually exhibit a hint of what might be acting chops meaning there isnt much excuse for not at least exploring more finely tuned vehicles to keep the gravy train running. ""There is no bright side"" a frustrated Jane shrieks at one point. For the Dualstar siblings in general thats probably not the case. In terms of ""New York Minute"" truer words have seldom been spoken. New York MinuteProductionA Warner Bros. release of a Dualstar Prods. /Di Novi Pictures production.
