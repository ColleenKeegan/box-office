Your Hero (harrison Ford) Is Back To Rescue His Dad (sean Connery) In A Dazzling Addition To Steven Spielbergs Film Series.By Desmond Ryan Inquirer Movie CriticPosted May 24 1989In his third adventure whip-smart archaeologist Indiana Jones has to rescue a dad rather than a damsel in continuing distress. For this cunning ploy give a tip of the fedora to those shrewd storytellers Steven Spielberg and George Lucas who recognize that the best way to put new life into an old quest is to turn to a parent.In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade which today jump-starts a sequel- laden summer movie season that Hollywood expects to shatter all records Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his father Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery) go off in search of the Holy Grail. The pursuit is predictably perilous and crammed with chases and cliffhangers but the core and charm of Spielbergs film come from what an estranged father and son find in each other.Followers of Lucas who again served as co-executive producer and helped to create the story of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and of Spielberg know how artfully these two have used this universal theme before. It is thrice- familiar in the relationship of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in the three Star Wars films and it is at the heart of Elliotts yearning in Spielbergs masterpiece E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial. Because the Indiana Jones movies depend as much on precisely calibrated humor as on the stunning technical virtuosity that is Spielbergs trademark there was an element of risk in suggesting that this time out Indys heart would belong to Daddy rather than some beauty he encountered hanging from the nearest cliff.But Spielberg had the canny instinct and happy inspiration to choose Connery. As soon as Connery welcomes his sons first rescue attempt by addressing him as Junior and they discover they have bedded the same gorgeous Nazi spy (Alison Doody) the right note of cantankerousness and grudging affection on both sides is struck. In what could easily have been a take-the- money-and-run performance from a lesser actor Connery is amazingly resourceful and imaginative.Its not the astonishing series of action set-pieces that you eventually prize in this lavishly executed entertainment. Its Connery an actor whose extraordinary talent has been recognized only in the autumn of a singular career. He brings out the very best in Ford who has nothing left to prove in this kind of part. Together their timing is impeccable and the chemistry is meticulously judged.For all its calculation and manipulation it is that chemistry that spares Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade from any significant hint of formula filmmaking. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom the ""prequel"" released in 1984 and the center of an emotional controversy about film violence certainly was open to that charge.Then again there were few challenges in movies more daunting than topping the great escapism of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). There is no way a film could rekindle the sense of discovery and the joy one felt at seeing Saturday- morning matinee cliffhangers fused to state-of-the-art technology and dazzling direction in Raiders. But on its own terms Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a considerable achievement.Fittingly enough Spielberg and screenwriter Jeffrey Boam begin this father-son tale by wittily reminding us that the child is father to the man. Indiana Jones played as a youth by River Phoenix encounters some grave robbers and in a riotous chase through a circus train we learn how he found his passion for the past and acquired his trademark bullwhip.The quest for the Holy Grail the cup that legend holds Jesus used at the Last Supper has been a font of heroic myths since Camelot. Henry Jones is obsessed with finding the Grail for reasons of scholarship. But he has company in American millionaire Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) who believes that to drink from the cup will confer immortality and a slew of Nazis who will kill anyone to win the prize.With what Lucas and Spielberg insist will be its last installment the Indiana Jones series is back on track. The Last Crusade has real bad guys in the Nazis (""Nazis. I hate em"" declares Indiana unequivocally) instead of those high priests in Temple of Doom who looked like the comic cultists who chased the Beatles in HelpThe movie has a lot of blithe silliness as it keeps up with the Joneses junior and senior in one scrape after another. But it also has an air of reality in that Indiana is always left to his own resources to figure a way out - whether hes being pursued by German fighter planes flying above the mountains of Austria or by Italian rats in the tombs beneath Venice.Fords flair for this kind of material needs no further airing here. He is a past master at suggesting to the audience that its all in good fun without ever diminishing the suspense. And Connery is a master from the past - most notably in the great James Bond films of the 60s - at doing exactly the same thing.Not surprisingly Ford has most of the action here. But Connery - in what is often a test of a true actor - shows how much you can do with an essentially passive part. Their presence in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - a movie that cracks along at a pace that makes the Indianapolis 500 seem like a funeral procession - unites two generations of movie heroes. Despite what Lucas and Spielberg say lets hope that this will not be the Ford- Connery teams last crusade.INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE    1/2Produced by Robert Watts; directed by Steven Spielberg; written by Jeffrey Boam; photography by Douglas Slocombe; music by John Williams; distributed by Paramount Pictures.Running time 2 hours 9 minutes.Indiana Jones - Harrison FordDr. Henry Jones - Sean ConneryDr. Elsa Schneider - Alison DoodySallah - John Rhys-DaviesMarcus Brody - Denholm Elliott Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onPowerball fever Jackpot rises to 900 millionMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

Crusade Fits Neatly Into Indy Trilogy - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Indiana Jones Crusade Fits Neatly Into Indy TrilogyMOVIES - MOVIE OF THE WEEKMay 28 1989|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade the third and (probably) final chapter of the Indiana Jones saga begins with a prologue in which we find the young Indiana (River Phoenix) embarking upon his earliest adventure. We see how he acquired his legendary hat learn when he started using a whip watch him tangle with innumerable snakes and marvel at his daredevil stunts.Then we jump ahead to 1938 when (after tying up a loose end or two from that boyhood adventure) the adult Indy (Harrison Ford) gets caught up in a sacred quest for the Holy Grail. Along for the roller-coaster ride this time is Indianas father a cantankerous medieval scholar Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery).The movies creative team - led by director Steven Spielberg executive co-producer George Lucas and screenwriter Jeffrey Boam (Innerspace The Lost Boys) - has been reluctant to tamper with the formula that produced the seventh (Raiders of the Lost Ark) and eighth (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) most successful films of all time.So though Last Crusade lacks the novelty of Raiders (and by the way the flat-out breathless pacing of Temple of Doom) its an entertaining capper to the trilogy. And if it becomes the ninth most successful film of all time no one will be a bit surprised.Rated PG-13 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is on view at Fashion Village 8 Interstate Mall 6 Pleasure Island 10 Plaza (Sanford) UC6 Lake Howell Square Hoffner Centre Republic Square Sand Lake 7 Orange Tree Osceola West and Lake Square 6.

3d `Indiana Jones` Lacks The Energy Of The Original - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 3d `Indiana Jones` Lacks The Energy Of The OriginalMay 26 1989|By Gene Siskel.Our Flick of the Week is ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade`` the third and final and disappointing conclusion to the adventure series created by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. This is not so much a bad film as a machine-like one lacking the same energy as the original which it most resembles.Instead of a hunt for the Ark of the Covenant this time Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is searching for the Holy Grail. Blocking his way part of the way are a Nazi sympathizer (Alison Doody) and Indy`s father (Sean Connery) who inspired his son`s interest in archeology and is captured by the Nazis as part of his own effort to find the Holy Grail.Save for an emotional ending involving a choice between family and treasure ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade`` is a triumph of technology over spirit. The film looks good but rarely surprises. The feeling of ``we`ve been here before and enjoyed it more`` pervades virtually every frame. Connery and Ford are not convincing as father and son.``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade`` is playing at the Biograph Burnham Plaza Water Tower and outlying theaters. Rated PG-13. (STAR)(STAR) 1/ 2Flicks Picks guide-New this week- GETTING IT RIGHT (Water Tower and outlying). A smart sympathetic coming-of-age story of a virginal 31-year-old working-class Englishman who still lives with his parents. A trio of women are drawn to him and the film is a smart study of how he manages to hang on to his individuality which others find attractive. This film proves that a little intelligent dialogue goes a long way. R. (STAR)(STAR)(STAR) 1/2- INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE (Biograph Burnham Plaza Water Tower and outlying). This week`s Flick of the Week. See above. Rated PG-13.(STAR)(STAR) 1/2- PINK CADILLAC (Biograph Burnham Plaza Chestnut Station and outlying). Clint Eastwood creates one of his dullest movie efforts in this lame story of a ``skip tracer`` who tries to retrieve a pretty bail-jumper (Bernadette Peters) who involves him with a white supremacy group. The whole effort seems recycled out of other better movies most notably ``Midnight Run`` with Robert De Niro playing a much more compelling skip tracer. PG-13.

"MOVIE REVIEW  Plunging Headlong Into Indys Last Adventure - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Indiana JonesMOVIE REVIEW  Plunging Headlong Into Indys Last AdventureMay 24 1989|SHEILA BENSON | Times Film Critic Were told that this is our last romp with ol Indiana that after ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" (citywide) the bullwhip will be retired. Well even if hes considerably more battered than his nearest competitor Indiana quits at the top of the heap. Its just that the heap isnt what it was eight years ago. Its been almost flattered to death.You cant roll monstrous boulders straight at audiences any more and have a whole theater-full duck and gasp with fright--and pleasure. We may be plumb gasped out. And although Harrison Ford is still in top form and the movie is truly fun in patches its a genre on the wane.Even the sparks that fly by combining Ford with Sean Connery as his strict scholarly father the first Prof. Henry Jones arent quite enough. What used to be thrilling is beginning to feel mechanical and its a shock to find the usually watchful Spielberg and Co. making careless mistakes. (Keep your eye on the ""X"" that marks the spot and youll discover what looks like a huge continuity glitz. Uh oh.)In Jeffrey Boams script from a story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes (""The Color Purples"" screenwriter) this last installment follows a headlong race for the Holy Grail the life-long obsession of Indys estranged medievalist-father. It is Papa Jones exhaustive diary a marvelously convincing prop which contains all the clues save one to the location of the Grail.The players are our heroes on one hand and those all-purpose villains the Nazis on the other. It seems they want the Grail as passionately as they wanted the Ark two movies ago. (Dont Nazis take notes? Compare notes? Learn from electrifying experience?)But first a prologue to show us where young Indy (River Phoenix virtually wasted) got most of his trademarks and his aversion to snakes. Its full-tilt action in this opening quarter hour and even with the jokey bits like Indy and the rhinosaurus horn its a chase that seems to go on forever.Its just the first of many. During the enfolding story of the rediscovery of father and son there are chases by speedboat by motorcycle by airplane horseback and armored tank. The Jones boys separately or together are bombed strafed chain-choked and menaced by sheets of flame. These slice-and-dice chases begin to feel less like Indiana Jones and more like James Bond.What the frantic action constantly breaks up are the growing moments of affection between this remote father and the son who has long felt shut out his life. Indianas resourcefulness begins to change his fathers faintly patronizing air and his fathers presence gives Indiana at last a chance to vent his feelings of rejection. It makes this quest story an inward one--or its clearly supposed to.But the focus is on the sensurround action. Both Ford and Connery play their I-never-told-him-I-loved-him moments full-out and unabashedly and they alternate them with good acerbic airclearing bits of accusation and grousing. But then someone strafes or pistol-whips them and the sentiment is diffused. In retrospect ""The Last Crusade"" (rated PG-13 for intense action) becomes a blur of activity not clearly defined peaks of emotion.And even with more than two hours of running time to tell this story Spielberg plunges into some scenes with such a perfunctory set-up that he catches his audience unprepared. The whole knights tomb sequence in Venice is so rushed that theres no sense of real work on Indianas part to solve this part of the puzzle. Its too easy too headlong; were onto a major discovery only minutes after Indy and Denholm Elliotts Marcus Brody have stepped off that gondola. Abruptness like this dazes and almost bewilders an audience; it certainly doesnt let them anticipate experience and then savor a sequence as elaborate as this one.Boams screenplay which has nice whimsical moments (like the Venetian librarians book-stamping joke) needs more of them or more great bits of action that grow from character such as Connerys inventiveness on the beach with his umbrella and the seagulls. ""Raiders"" was a plum-pudding of such indelible bits and they are sorely missed.Back again are John Rhys-Davies splendidly expansive Sallah and Elliotts quintessentially British Museum curator Brody. The film makers seem to have given up the job of finding a suitable woman for Indiana after they retired Karen Allens Marion Ravenwood from ""Raiders."" But thats no excuse for the alliances held by Alison Doodys icy Austrian art historian Dr. Elsa Schneider.Its as though in forging a bond between father and son the idea of any woman became impossible so the film makers gave Indiana a clearly impossible choice.

A fitting end to the original trilogy Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade captures some of the sense of fun that infused the first movie while using the addition of Sean Connery to up the comedic ante and provide a father/son dynamic. The absence of Karen Allens Marion is still a sore spot (one that has been rectified in the fourth film) and leaves a gap in the love interest department that Alison Doody doesnt come close to filling. There are also times when the filmmakers infatuation with comedy detracts from The Last Crusades capacity for suspense. All things considered however it provided viewers in the 80s with something more palatable than its immediate predecessor. As with Raiders of the Lost Ark The Last Crusade deals with the quest for a long-lost religious artifact and has Indy opposing the Nazis in the race to get it. In this case the object is the Holy Grail which for better or for worse is most commonly associated in current popular culture with Monty Python. Reportedly this association nearly caused director Steven Spielberg to reject the project until George Lucas convinced him to re-consider. Its worth noting however that the films occasionally jokey tone is at times almost reminiscent of a Python skit. The Last Crusade opens with a prologue set in 1912 that features River Phoenix as Young Indy. (Phoenix would not reprise the role in the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles television series that aired in 1992-93. He was offered the role but turned it down and was replaced by Sean Patrick Flannery.) A mini-origin story of sorts it shows an early adventure and explains how Indy got the scar on his chin and developed his fear of snakes. The bulk of the film transpires in 1938 and follows the adult Indy (Harrison Ford) on his search for his missing father Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery) who is believed to have discovered vital clues to the location of the Holy Grail. Indys globe-trotting trip is funded by a wealthy American Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) and he is accompanied to the first stop Venice by old friend Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot). Its there that he meets this films love interest Elsa Schneider (Alision Doody). Later in the movie as the ragtag group gets closer to their goal they are joined by Indys stalwart sidekick from the first film Sallah (John Rhys-Davies). Each of the Indiana Jones movies features both a ""creature scene"" and a big-time action sequence. In Raiders its snakes and the truck chase with the Ark. In Temple of Doom its bugs and the mine cart roller coaster. In The Last Crusade its rats and the tank chase. The former required using a combination of specially bred live rats and mechanical animals created by the special effects department. That latter required weeks of filming to bring all the elements together of what is easily The Last Crusades most extended and exciting segment. There are of course other cliffhanger episodes to go along with these including a boat chase in Venice a footrace atop and through a moving train full of circus animals and an escape from a German airship. The new element introduced here is the father/son dynamic between Indy and Henry. The script in unsubtle ways makes it apparent that everything Indy does is designed to earn his fathers attention and respect neither of which is easily given. Father and son have a prickly relationship but the depth of their feelings for each other is brought out late in the proceedings as each must face the prospect of losing the other. Since The Last Crusades romantic element is so feeble this provides the films emotional core and it allows us to see Indy as more than the dashing romantic somewhat bettered adventurer of the previous two features. The lapse of time between The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade does nothing to blunt Fords ability to don the fedora and grab the whip and become this generations greatest adventurer again. Of all the characters Ford has played over the years and with apologies to Han Solo the actor is most strongly associated with Dr. Jones and its no surprise. If ever there was perfect synergy between a performers strengths and a character this is it. For Ford slipping into the Indy persona in The Last Crusade is like putting on an old comfortable costume. Casting Sean Connery as Henry raises all sorts of James Bond associations. Spielberg is on record as having said that the Indiana Jones movies are ""his"" 007 films and that he always envisioned Indy as a Bond-like character. There are in fact nine actors in The Last Crusade who previously appeared in the 007 franchise including a former Bond girl (Alison Doody) a former Bond villain (Julian Glover) and of course Connery. At the time of filming Connery was only 57 (and a mere six years removed from his most recent outing as Bond) but since he was playing a 75-year-old man stunts were out of the question. So all the derring-do is left to Harrison Ford. Connery is along for the ride. Its good to see old friends like Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies again. Their absence from The Temple of Doom is keenly felt. Their inclusion in The Last Crusade makes the production into a reunion of sorts. This would be one of Elliots final screen performances. He was diagnosed with AIDS shortly before filming began and would die several years later. Rhys-Davies doesnt have a lot to do in this movie but its welcome just to have him around. Both of the major newcomers are rather weak. As the movies villain Julian Glover is too urbane to be truly menacing. And while Alison Doody is pretty enough is a cool blond sort of way her character is uninteresting and her chemistry with Harrison Ford is even less combustible than what he shared with Kate Capshaw in the second film. The Last Crusades end game is weak. None of the Indiana Jones movies have ended on high notes but this is the least impressive of the three. Its not just that theres too much exposition and too little action but that Donovans fate is unsatisfying Elsas character goes off the deep end and there are numerous unanswered questions. The Last Crusade is one of those films where the journey is more enjoyable than what happens when the destination is reached. Viewers stick with the movie during its final fifteen minutes not because its an example of great entertainment but because of a desire to see how everything turns out. Theres redemption for the good guys punishment for the bad guys and a sense of closure. In a way perhaps thats all that matters. The Last Crusade contains enough humor that one could almost classify the movie as an action-comedy. The lightness of tone feels like an overreaction to the darkness that permeated The Temple of Dooms second half. The bickering between Indy and his father resembles that of the Odd Couple and Connery in a departure from what might be expected from an actor who played cinemas most iconic action hero is on hand mainly for comic relief. At least the jokes in The Last Crusade are better integrated into the whole than in The Temple of Doom where some of them were awkward. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade took five years to get off the ground due in large part to schedule issues with Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg. Audiences greeted the return of Indiana Jones enthusiastically (one wonders if the same will be true of the fourth installment which follows a nineteen year absence). The film was the second highest grossing picture of the year trailing only Batman and finishing ahead of a number of other high-profile sequels including Back to the Future II Lethal Weapon 2 and Star Trek V. The mixture of action comedy and romance provided in Raiders of the Lost Ark has been imitated many times over the years but never matched. Of all the pretenders The Last Crusade is among the few to have come close and a lot of that has to do with the movies three invaluable assets star Harrison Ford co-star Sean Connery and director Steven Spielberg. So while The Last Crusade is not the second coming of Raiders of the Lost Ark its as worthy a sequel as any is likely to be.

To say that Paramounts ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" may be the best film ever made for 12-year-olds is not a backhanded compliment. What was conceived as a childs dream of a Saturday matinee serial has evolved into a moving excursion into religious myth. More cerebral than the first two Indiana Jones films and less schmaltzy than the second this literate adventure should make big bucks by entertaining and enlightening kids and adults alike. The Harrison Ford-Sean Connery father-and-son team gives ""Last Crusade"" unexpected emotional depth reminding us that real film magic is not in special effects. For Lucas and Spielberg who are now entering middle age the fact that this is more a character film than f/x extravaganza could signal a welcome new level of ambition. Jeffrey Boams witty and laconic screenplay based on a story by Lucas and Menno Meyjes takes Ford and Connery on a quest for a prize bigger than the Lost Ark of the Covenant - the Holy Grail. Connery is a medieval lit prof with strong religious convictions who has spent his life assembling clues to the grails whereabouts. Father and more intrepid archaeologist son piece them together in an around-the-world adventure leading to a touching and mystical finale that echoes ""Star Wars"" and ""Lost Horizon."" The love between father and son transcends even the quest for the Grail which is guarded by a spectral 700-year-old knight beautifully played by Robert Eddison. This film minimizes the formulaic love interest giving newcomer Alison Doody an effectively sinuous but decidedly secondary role. The principal love story is between father and son making Fords casually sadistic personality more sympathetic than in the previous pics. The relationship between the men is full of tension manifesting itself in Connerys amusing sexual one-upmanship and his string of patronizing putdowns. Theres also a warmth and growing respect between them that makes this one of the most pleasing screen pairings since Newman met Redford. Connery confidently plays his aging character as slightly daft and fuzzy-minded without blunting his forcefulness and without sacrificing his sexual charisma. The cartoonlike Nazi villains of ""Raiders"" have been replaced by more genuinely frightening Nazis led by Julian Glover and Michael Byrne. Most of the film takes place in 1938 and Spielberg stages a chilling scene at a Nazi book-burning rally in Berlin where Ford has a brief encounter with Adolf Hitler. But exec producers Lucas and Frank Marshall producer Robert Watts and Spielberg do not neglect the action set-pieces that give these films their commercial cachet. Theres the opening chase on top of a train in the Utah desert involving a youthful Indy (River Phoenix) in 1912; a ferocious tank battle in the desert; a ghastly scene with hundreds of rats in a Venice catacomb; some aerial hijinks with a zeppelin and small planes and many more outlandish scenes. Perhaps the films most impressive technical aspect is the soundtrack designed by Ben Burtt. While the noise level sometimes becomes painful the artistry is stunning. Douglas Slocombes lensing has a subtly burnished look and Elliott Scotts production design is always spectacular. The Industrial Light amp; Magic visual effects-supervised by Michael J. McAlister with Patricia Blau producing for the aerial unit-are artful and seamless. John Williams score again is a major factor in the appeal and pacing and editor Michael Kahn makes the film move like a bullet. Other tech contributions are impeccable. This is a film of which Lucas and Spielberg and their collaborators long will be proud. Mac. 1989 Best Sound Effects Editing.

Thrills? How about Rats?In ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" director Steven Spielberg capitalizes on these and other basic human needs. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" this aint but ""Crusade"" towers like a knight over ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" Start lining up now bring a bullwhip -- and maybe some d-Con. Indiana will do the rest.Indiana and Dad that is -- Dad being father-figure-for-hire Sean Connery who it turns out is an old block off of Harrison Fords chip. ""Junior"" he keeps calling his son. ""Stop calling me Junior "" Jones-the-younger keeps saying.Their Oedipal vexation is the central theme in a quest for the spiritual big one -- the Holy Grail. Ford has been dispatched to retrieve Daddy Connery who was close to uncovering the blessed chalice but has been nabbed as usual by the armies of darkness. ""Nazis"" says Ford. ""I hate these guys.""Naturally Luke Sky -- uh Indiana Jones links up with his father and traverses the world this time with stops at Venice the Austro-German border (pausing for an unrequested autograph from Hitler) and Alexandria Egypt. You know its surprising Indiana Jones never bumps into James Bond.If you go to ""Crusade"" though youre not looking for surprises. You can safely expect Jones trademark twisted grin hat wisecracks and whip cracks the pantomime villains the ingeniously rigged catastrophes (including a plane that loses its wings in a tunnel but lands and keeps speeding down the road) and the tributes by cine-kid Spielberg to everything from ""The Birds"" to ""She."" Story coauthors George Lucas and Menno Meyjes and scriptwriter Jeffrey Boam make this one eternal chase-crusade -- by circus train (featuring River Phoenix as young Indiana) motorboat motorbike zeppelin warplane horse camel and tank. They also slip in a naughty close encounter with ice queen Alison Doody who it turns out has a thing for fathers and fatherlands.But rest assured In Spielberg-Lucas lore every good boy deserves favor and every bad girl gets her comeuppance. In the end the father-son team undertakes a triumphant final test including a Peter Pannish leap of faith and a Christlike ascension -- you know Spielberg Heaven.And Spielberg Heaven was all you were looking for right?

"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Related Item Go to Video Finder Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade By Hal Hinson Washington Post Staff Writer May 24 1989 Director Steven Spielberg Cast Harrison Ford; Sean Connery; Denholm Elliott; John Rhys-Davies; River Phoenix Children under 13 should be accompanied by a parent Oscars Effects Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa Of all the directors working in the movies today Steven Spielberg has the truest instincts for keeping an audience visually engaged plugged in. This is his great gift -- to put us inside his movies -- and at his best his natural command of the simple mechanics of storytelling of editing and camera movements and pacing enables him to evoke a kind of pop transcendence that comes close to the effect of the higher classical arts. The greatest of his films are pure pop epiphanies exhilarating innocent and uniquely indelibly his own.Somehow though they are your own too and the great disappointment of ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" the largely irrelevant third and (supposedly) final installment in the hair-raising adventures of the superarcheologist is that it seems to be neither yours nor his.In pictures like ""Sugarland Express"" and ""Jaws"" and ""E.T."" Spielberg told his stories explosively as if they were nearly bursting out of him. Those movies -- and the earlier Indy films as well -- were essays in velocity and propulsiveness. ""The Last Crusade"" is the first of Spielbergs films to make us feel heavy in our seats the first to leave us sitting passive and uninvolved on the outside. Watching it you feel that nearly anyone could have directed it.In fact the material here isnt significantly worse than in the previous installments. But the absence of Spielbergs transforming touch lays bare what in the earlier films remained somewhat hidden. Stuffed with routine thrills ""The Last Crusade"" is nearly all chases and dull exposition. Whereas the previous two Indy films began with a cracking bang this one begins with a thud.It commences in Utah in 1912 with a young Indiana Jones played by River Phoenix attempting to filch a jewel-encrusted cross from a band of archeologists. During the ensuing chase across the roof of a circus train the mop-topped Boy Scout reveals the origins of such bits of Indy lore as his hat his bullwhip and his famous aversion to snakes. (It even shows us how he got that tiny scar across his chin.) But jammed all together without emphasis or drama they seem reduced in significance -- frankly with their magical aura broken they seem cheesy.After these bland elaborations on the Indiana mythology the movie settles down to the telling of its central story which involves the search for the Holy Grail a treasured relic that Indianas father the eminent archeologist Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) has searched for all his life. Others it seems are interested in the prize as well including the Nazis who abduct the scholarly doctor and hold him captive in a castle in the Austrian mountains. Indys search therefore is for his father not the Grail (though in the movies eyes theyre pretty much equal).Before he sets out though the characters gab at each other for what seems like an eternity elucidating Grail ephemera. Ive been saddened appalled and infuriated by other Spielberg films but never bored yet there are long patches in ""The Last Crusade"" -- even in the midst of feverish action -- when I simply checked out. Spielbergs talent for swift and hyperbolic storytelling seems to have deserted him here. Rather than make the frame come alive with information and evocative detail he seems content with standard setups and solutions. Watching these exposition scenes you feel as if Spielberg were intentionally trying to find a more conventional way of putting his narrative across. Its as if he were trying for mere plodding competence.Its not just in the exposition scenes that the picture goes slack. Aside from the majestic opening vistas (a homage to David Lean?) and a brief sequence in Berlin showing a Nazi book burning the film is completely lacking in visual grandeur. Since the series is famous for its hairbreadth escapes and high-pitched brawls the filmmakers have supplied a boat chase a motorcycle chase and an airplane chase. There is also an escape from a ancient rat-infested crypt an escape from a castle and an escape from a Nazi dirigible. With the exception of a climactic tank battle which piles thrill upon thrill until it seems nearly unbearable the big action set pieces dont accumulate any momentum. Mostly theyre flat and uninvolving.The rapport between Harrison Ford as Indy and Connery is the movies choicest feature and in places it acquires a special burnish -- at times its almost moving. Clearly with this relationship the filmmakers are attempting both to deepen the series and to redeem it (in their minds) from the ignominy of the darker much-criticized second film. In fact the relationship provides the film with at least something to discover some reason for being. Spielberg has said that his motive for casting Connery was to give Ford an actor of equal weight to play against and though Ford hardly provides any revelations the stars do match up nicely. Theyre solid up there those two; spiritually they could be father and son and the rough masculinity that both actors project helps lend some significance to the characters.The relationship though is conceived wholly in father-son cliches. Dressed in his thick Victorian tweeds Dr. Jones is the stern work-obsessed taskmaster who at least from the boys point of view seems completely indifferent to his sons existence. Unable to get his attention Indy began his travels and his farfetched adventures. This sets up the films fundamental banality -- that in reality Indy has been engaged in a search for the father or his fathers approval his whole life. This is tolerable at least when it is expressed in comic terms as say when Indy unseats a Nazi from his motorbike and turning to his father for acknowledgment finds him casually winding his watch instead. But when straightfaced the filmmakers ask us to accept the banality behind the banality -- that Dr. Jones wants to love his son but doesnt know how -- you feel a groan welling up deep within you.In one respect Spielberg and his producing partner George Lucas have carried their series deeper -- deeper into the hooey. The final section in which Indy must claim the Grail and save his fathers life is imbued with a turgid pop-mystical tone. (It doesnt help that these scenes look as if they were lit with a Lava Lamp.) The sense of momentousness and wonder they strain for doesnt come across though. And not only is there a shortage of magic theres a shortage of sense as well.Even with all the essential ingredients in place the picture seems dispirited perfunctory. Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies reprise their roles as Marcus and Sallah with Elliott looking as if he cant wait to curl up under the nearest shade tree. And Alison Doody does mannequinlike service in her movie debut as Indys female partner and adversary. Even with Connery and Ford though Spielberg is the star and his disengagement is the determining force. The director has been quoted as saying that there were only two reasons for him to make a third Indiana Jones picture and one of them was to fulfill a commitment to his friend Lucas (the other was to atone for the perceived sins of their second installment). As a result the film seems swamped with the spirit of obligation. Like James Bond and Superman Indiana Jones is a superhero ageless invulnerable immortal. But if ""Empire of the Sun"" is any indication Spielberg has grown beyond superheroes. He made his famous handshake deal with Lucas more than 10 years ago when he was still a boy wonder himself. And by now his heart just isnt in it. ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" is rated PG-13 and contains some violence.
