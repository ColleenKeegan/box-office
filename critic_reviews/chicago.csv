Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Highlighted by songs in which women celebrate the murder of wayward men and a lawyer demonstrates the art of manipulating the media musicals dont get much more cynical than Chicago. A ripped-from-the-headlines jazz-age play by Chicago Tribune reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins turned into a 1975 musical by songwriters John Kander and Fred Ebb in collaboration with Bob Fosse Chicago enjoyed an initial run of qualified success overshadowed by the crowd-pleasing A Chorus Line. It makes perfect sense however that it found a second audience on Broadway in the 1990s. It also makes sense that this tale of quicksilver celebrity sensation-peddling media and the way both obscure truth and justice should find a wider audience still in 2002. More a narrative revue than a play Chicago doesnt immediately lend itself to a cinematic interpretation and the conceptual difficulties kept it from the screen until now. But in his film debut theater and TV vet Rob Marshall slashes through this Gordian knot by turning the songs into Walter Mitty-esque asides and never trying to play down the artificiality. Just as the 1995 stage revival looked to Fosse the choreographer for inspiration Marshall looks to Fosse the film director keeping the staging dark and the frills limited and letting the rhythm of the music and the dancing drive the rhythm of the editing. Realized with flair and confidence belying the fact that--apart from the more determinedly experimental Moulin Rouge and Dancer In The Dark--this is the first high-profile musical in some years Chicagos musical numbers could stand on their own even if the compelling story didnt sweep them along. A former chorus girl turned unhappy housewife Renee Zellweger dreams of playing a glamorous nightclub stage so much so that when a lover who promised her a shot at the big time turns out to be a phony he earns a chest full of bullets and Zellweger wins a quick trip to the Cook County Jail. When the film turns to song however that stage and even grander locales belong to her and the fellow inhabitants of Murderers Row whose numbers include press darling Catherine Zeta-Jones one half of a sister act who rid herself of both partner and husband when she found them in bed together. Jones rebuffs Zellwegers admiration but lives to regret it when the new inmate subsequently eclipses her in fame thanks to shameless lawyer Richard Gere and his promise to make Zellweger both famous and acquittable by turning her into the ""sweetest little jazz killer to ever hit Chicago."" As sentimental as a plywood casket Chicago has satirical bite and a mean wit that somehow never obscures its characters unlikely likability. Zellweger becomes a liar and a manipulator subsequent to her career as a murderer but in her world these practically qualify as survival skills. Characters use the line ""This is Chicago"" to explain any number of things the fickleness of the press the substitution of performance for politics the intertwining of sentimentality and callousness. In Watkins time that line may have read more literally and less like a general state of mind. It doesnt sound that way now.

David James(c)Miramax Films By Ben Nuckols Associated Press Writer The path from stage to screen was arduous and the director could hardly be greener but the Broad-way-spawned ""Chicago"" is every inch a movie. Its kinetic dynamic and always entertaining -- but also a tad chaste. Structured on the stage as ""musical vaudeville"" performed directly to the audience ""Chicago"" has been reimagined as a highly subjective mind-trip seen through the eyes of Roxie Hart (Renee Zell-weger) a star-struck naif who morphs into a jaded celebrity and back again. The musical numbers unfold almost exclusively in Roxies mind a conceit that allows for some in-spired intercutting between a pristine soundstage recreation of 1929 Chicago and an always morphing bare stage where the characters belt out tunes and strut their stuff. Its a savvy approach and for anyone new to ""Chicago"" it might just be mind-blowing. With the song and dance staged as elaborate fantasies ""Chicago"" doesnt resemble last years ""Mou-lin Rouge"" as much as Lars von Triers ""Dancer in the Dark."" When Roxie imagines music from the ambient sounds she hears in her prison cell were reminded ever so briefly of Bjorks heartbreaking death-row rendition of ""My Favorite Things."" Theres even a woman sent to the gallows but were en-couraged to forget about it five minutes later. The knock on ""Chicago"" has always been its slightness its wisp of a story and candied ruminations on the disposability of celebrity. But choreographer Bob Fosse -- and in the thrilling 1996 revival Ann Reinking -- brought to it such a hypercharged sensuality that you were drawn in further than you felt was possible. The cast did things with simple wooden chairs that seemed to beg for a raid from the vice squad. The cinematic ""Chicago"" doesnt have that carnal edge _ partly because Rob Marshall a longtime choreographer who has worked almost exclusively in the theater does such a good job as a movie director. With Marshalls crisp propulsive editing rhythm the choreography hardly stands a chance. Nobody dances more than a few steps in a single shot. The fun begins when Zellwegers Roxie shoots her lover (Dominic West) in a rage because he lied about helping her get on the vaudeville stage like her idol Velma Kelley (Catherine Zeta-Jones). But she finds that murder accounts for more exposure than a thousand auditions as Velma. who has recently bumped off her husband and sister. is basking in the biggest spotlight of her career from her prison cell. With help from prison matron Mama Morton (Queen Latifah) and lawyer-to-the-stars Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) Roxie soon surpasses Velma in her manipulation of the publics sympathy. Zellweger and Zeta-Jones put audiences in an awkward position Since so few film actors are required to sing or dance these days were supposed to be impressed that they can do either not carp about their shortcomings. They look and sound like highly trained movie stars giving it their all sometimes with visible effort and neithers voice has much oomph. Otherwise theyre terrific Zellweger expertly mixes her signature chirpy daftness with a tough quick-witted cynicism; and Zeta-Jones her considerable charisma put to proper use for once rivets your attention with Velmas sordid elegance. Gere was born to play Billy Flynn A frequently superficial performer who finds his characters through surface gestures hes been giving us the ol razzle-dazzle through 20 years of stardom. Flynn is all surface and his climactic performance in the courtroom intercut with footage of Gere tap-dancing brings self-satisfaction to dizzying new heights. Hes a sham and he loves it. Latifah has the best voice in the cast by far and the sexiest delivery -- she belts out ""When Youre Good to Mama with show-stopping brio. And John C. Reilly makes an adorable doormat as Roxies nebbish husband Amos yet hes so convincingly pained that he flattens the comic impact of his song ""Mr. Cellophane. With performers as good as these and the freshness of Bill Condons screenplay and Marshalls direction theres really very little wrong with ""Chicago. What it lacks is something intangible -- heat. ""Chicago"" is rated PG-13 for sexual content and dialogue violence and thematic elements. Running time 107 minutes. Return to top Copyright(c) 2000 - 2016 Canarsie Courier Publications Inc.

Whats wrong with that? Nothing at all which is why most of his stylish movie breezes by so pleasantly. Mr. Spielberg has gone back to his roots as a genial entertainer in directing this chronicle of a real-life con man -- almost a con boy actually -- and the FBI agent determined to bring him in. Leonardo DiCaprio is blithely charming as the scammer Frank W. Abagnale Jr. who during the 1960s made millions through check fraud while posing as a doctor a lawyer and an airline pilot -- he passed on Indian chief -- and all before his 21st birthday. (Mr. DiCaprios performance here is much more enjoyable varied and convincing than his work in ""Gangs Of New York."") Tom Hanks is Agent Carl Hanratty who looks like one of the Blues Brothers when hes wearing his shades. Hanratty is nowhere near as dumb as he seems even though hes usually a step behind his cocky quarry; Mr. Hanks leavens the agents dogged devotion to duty with an appealing shrewdness. While Franks outrageous exploits keep upping the ante in the episodic script which Jeff Nathanson based on the 1980 autobiography of the same name its the cat-and-mouse relationship between two driven lonely men that carries the freight when the exploits pale. If were to believe Mr. Abagnales apologia filtered through Mr. Spielbergs fondness for family fables Frank did what he did out of a desire to repair the losses suffered by his haplessly crooked impecunious father (a terrific performance by Christopher Walken). As simplistic as this notion may be it doesnt interfere with our enjoyment of Juniors suave successes -- people cant wait to be gulled by him -- or the shimmering surfaces of an elegant production designed by Jeannine Oppewall and photographed by Janusz Kaminski. (Wait till you see Park Avenue chockablock with period cars or Franks dashingly fraudulent pilot seizing his main chance in TWAs futuristic terminal at JFK.) Eventually though ""Catch Me If You Can"" falters on several counts. The movie which is too long cant figure out what to make of its opaque hero Does he have any feelings about anything or anyone but his father? It scants his intelligence in favor of his audacity and neglects to explain the depth of knowledge that nourishes his larcenous dreams. (When and where for example did he learn to be the high-tech world-class counterfeiter he becomes toward the end?) The more audacious Frank grows the more were asked to take his story on faith. ""Catch Me If You Can"" finally seems like a bit of a con in its own right but a marvelously smooth one. Chicago Coming out of ""Chicago"" I overheard one woman say to another ""I hate musicals but I loved this movie."" Well I loved musicals when good ones were still being made but I didnt hate this movie though I certainly didnt love it. Rob Marshalls screen version of the near-venerable show looks great in its razzly-dazzly neo-Fosse way and sounds good especially when Renee Zellwegers gorgeous Roxie Hart is singing her heart out. Its amazing that Ms. Zellweger has been able to invest her scenes with so much emotion given the movies dehumanized scheme hyperkinetic pacing bare-bones storytelling and relentless fragmentation a la ""Moulin Rouge."" By the end though the production is engulfed by barely controlled frenzy -- all decor and no air music as lo-cal ear candy scenes as merchandise to be sold people as two-dimensional props. Even feet are used as props. The dance numbers are so discombobulated that theres no way of knowing if anyone in the movie can actually dance. TEN BESTSee Joe Morgensterns picks for 2002s top movies. With its show-business history that goes back to the 1920s (and includes William Wellmans lively 1942 screen comedy ""Roxie Hart"" starring Ginger Rogers) ""Chicago"" is a property with perennially relevant themes murder celebrity and media manipulation in the flapper era of a corrupt justice system. In this version Catherine Zeta-Jones is Velma Kelly the homicidal vaudevillian (played by Bebe Neuwirth in the 1996 Broadway revival) who competes with Roxie her fellow prisoner on death row for the various services of ace attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). Ms. Zeta-Jones is a formidable presence whenever shes given uninterrupted screen time but her Velma is eclipsed by Roxies ardent fantasies which become the substance of the movies many surrealist passages. Mr. Gere could have used some eclipsing; hes all too visibly out there on his own singing gamely and dancing badly. John C. Reilly as Roxies gullible husband seems to have done splendidly with the great heartbreaking Kander and Ebb song ""Mr. Cellophane"" but thats only a guess based on the fragment that got to the screen. Maybe one day well see a whole DVD of ""Chicago"" outtakes. The Hours As I think back on the many spellbinding minutes of ""The Hours"" I must confess somewhat defensively that one of my favorite passages involves an anguishing argument between Meryl Streeps Clarissa Vaughan a woman living in contemporary New York City and her friend and former lover Richard (a fine fierce performance by Ed Harris) who is dying of AIDS. I feel defensive because I responded most strongly to one of the most conventional elements of a daringly unconventional film about three women mysteriously linked across time whose lives resonate with one another and with the substance of a novel by Virginia Woolf. Yet the links and resonances remain largely abstract -- to understand them isnt necessarily to be moved by them -- while the individual dramas of those three lives are often stirring and the three starring performances are unforgettable. Nicole Kidman plays Virginia Woolf struggling with insanity in 1920s England as she starts to write her first great novel ""Mrs. Dalloway."" Ms. Kidman is unrecognizable mainly because of her characters large aquiline nose (if Olivier could use fake schnozzolas why cant she?) but her work is unmistakably serious and skillful -- and chilling in its evocation of Virginias bleak suicidal intensity. Julianne Moore is Laura Brown a Los Angeles wife and mother reading ""Mrs. Dalloway"" more than two decades later and drawn by the book and her own solitary grief toward another tragic end. Ms. Streeps Clarissa who was nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by her lover long ago is living out the book; like Clarissa Dalloway shes about to give a party and confronting the joys and sorrows of her life during the course of a single day. ""The Hours"" was directed by Stephen Daldry from David Hares adaptation of Michael Cunninghams novel which won the Pulitzer prize for fiction in 1998. Seamus McGarvey did the lovely cinematography and Philip Glasss pulsing surging score helps to strengthen the films connections and unify its various parts. For me those connections remain more intellectual than organic but theres nothing intellectualized about the three flesh-and-blood women on screen. Theyre thoroughly urgently alive. The Pianist Sometimes a single shot can signify an entire film. In ""The Pianist"" a saga of survival during World War II in Poland the shot comes late when the Jewish composer and pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) finally decides to flee the besieged Warsaw ghetto where he has been hiding. Starving half-crazed and terrified by Nazi troops closing in with flame-throwers Szpilman who had been a celebrity in his native land before the war climbs a short fence clambers over a masonry wall and then on the other side finds himself in a gray-blue landscape -- almost a moonscape -- of utter desolation. The spectacle is as powerful as anything else in the film though thats not all to the good. ""The Pianist"" which was directed by a Holocaust survivor Roman Polanski is astonishing visually and problematic dramatically. The horrors recounted by the film go beyond Hollywoods darkest dreams -- spasms of beatings and shootings random acts of savagery so casual as to seem concocted by a filmmaker given to exaggeration. Yet the story has a factual basis -- Szpilmans autobiography from which Ronald Harwood adapted the script. And the production has in Mr. Brody an actor of exceptional tact and delicacy whose very appearance is dramatic; his mournful mien recalls strangely enough Charles Aznavour in ""Shoot the Piano Player."" All the more disappointing then that ""The Pianist"" is so emotionally remote. We see what this artist-turned-survivalist must do to stay alive. We watch with respect that sometimes borders on awe. And we wait unavailingly to find out who he really is.  DVD TIP A couple of years ago I included in a DVD roundup a brief reference to Steven Spielbergs joyous comedy of chaos ""1941"" which was released in 1979. This revisionist absurdist history of World War II was his first flop after two mega hits ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters."" Still in an interview thats included on the Collectors Edition DVD the director speaks with justifiable fondness of ""1941"" as a ""blast in the face of imagery and sound and crazy people and over-the-top performances."" After seeing Mr. Spielbergs ""Catch Me If You Can"" its interesting -- and a blast -- to go back to ""1941"" for a refresher course on how his sense of fun evolved.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores Movie Review War Hero Drawing on his own experiences during the Holocaust Roman Polanski creates a searingly haunted tale in his restrained adaptation of The Pianist a memoir of music and survival. By Peter Rainer ShareThis Fear City In The Pianist Adrien Brody plays a Jewish musician living in the Warsaw ghetto during the Holocaust.  (Photo Guy Ferrandis) The Pianist is based on the memoirs of Polish musician Wladyslaw Szpilman who survived the Warsaw ghetto and its Roman Polanskis strongest and most personally felt movie. This should not come as a great surprise since as a child Polanski survived the Krakow ghetto and lost family members in the Holocaust. The real surprise is that the horrors on display in The Pianist are presented matter-of-factly -- which of course makes them seem even more horrific. We are not accustomed to such reserve in a movie about the Holocaust and especially not in a Polanski movie where the violence has often been close to Grand Guignol. But in this film he is trying to be devastatingly true to his emotions and so there is no need for hyperbole. At times the tension between the unwavering directness of his technique and the anguish that is behind it is almost unbearable. When we see a Nazi soldier casually shoot a Jewish girl in the head for asking an innocent question or when we see soldiers throw an old man in a wheelchair over a balcony we are staring into an everyday inferno. Szpilman who is played with feral grace by Adrien Brody survived it Alone among his family he managed to escape from the ghetto and hide out in Warsaw until the wars end. We first see him in 1939 not quite 30 playing Chopin during a radio broadcast interrupted by German bombing. At the end we see him playing the same nocturne in a concert hall that had once been shelled. Its as if his story had come full circle except that he is crying now and savoring each note the way he savored each morsel of food in captivity. Halfway through the movie theres a great brief scene where Szpilman is hidden away in a Warsaw apartment and unable to touch its piano for fear of alerting the neighbors to his presence. The silent agony that ensues is one of the most powerful expressions of spiritual denial Ive ever seen in a film. Szpilmans artistry is not sentimentalized; we are never made to feel that he stayed alive because of it. Mostly he survived on luck and gumption. But Polanski recognizes the soul-deep power that music held for Szpilman and his playing in the end is both an anthem of renewal and a lament. Polanski doesnt sentimentalize the Jews either. The Jewish police employed by the Germans in the ghetto are shown to be almost as ruthless as their overseers and some of the underground operatives turn out to be scoundrels. In his memoir which was published in 1946 under the title Death of a City and soon banned by the Communists Szpilman wrote that his experience shattered his belief in the ""solidarity of the Jews."" No doubt some people will regard the divulging of that experience as a betrayal but Polanski honors the Jews of Warsaw by not romanticizing them; besides there are many acts of extraordinary generosity and courage in The Pianist. They are just as inexplicable as the depravities. Although he engages in some minor arms smuggling Szpilman himself is not especially brave or virtuous. He is not the kind of conventional hero -- or anti-hero for that matter -- a movie such as this would seem to require. Hes a watcher a reactor and yet his recessiveness has metaphorical power Szpilman is like a wraith witnessing the ruin of his beloved city and its people. (The Pianist is among others things a eulogy for Warsaw.) When he is finally driven out of his hiding places and wanders the blasted streets the imagery goes beyond starkness into the surreal -- we might be looking at a lunar landscape by De Chirico. The most remarkable aspect of Szpilmans memoir is that it was written so close to the time of the events described and yet is full of poise and equanimity. There is no ache for revenge in his book and there is none in Polanskis film either. Szpilman lived out his days in Poland as a celebrated pianist and composer of popular songs and childrens music dying in 2000. Polanski whose notorious and harrowing life is well known had not until this movie filmed in Poland in 40 years. And yet these two men who might appear from their lives and works to be temperamentally unalike share a distaste for special pleading or bathos. In The Pianist suffering is seen with such clarity that its relief becomes a balm of the greatest magnitude. Its the relief we get when Szpilman plays the piano again or merely makes it through another day. In moments like these we are confronted with the significance the momentousness of the ordinary. Much like the Michael Cunningham novel its based on The Hours is tony and allusive. Its about three women living in different eras during a single day Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) who is writing Mrs. Dalloway in 1923; Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) a deeply unhappy wife and mother in Los Angeles in 1951 who is engulfed in reading Mrs. Dalloway; and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) a contemporary New York personification of Woolfs Clarissa Dalloway who is preparing a party for an old love Richard (Ed Harris) a gay poet in the final stages of aids. At his best Stephen Daldry who directed from a script by David Hare makes the intertwinings among these lives seem mysteriously apt; he gets at the ways in which literature can close us off from the world and yet unify us with others who have read the same books. Cunninghams novel was an aesthetic conceit a set of themes and variations on Mrs. Dalloway and the film puts some flesh on its delicate brittle bones. (It also adds unfortunately Philip Glasss aural wallpaper.) If all three of the womens lives had come across with equal weight and artistry the film which glides back and forth among them might have approached the symphonic. But only the Streep section truly inspires the kind of awe and terror that the film as a whole strives for. Streep is having a good run of it this month First Adaptation where she seemed newly freed-up and languorous and now The Hours where her pinpoint sensitivities are so expressive that you feel as if youre inside her skin. On the surface Clarissa has a comfortable life Shes lived for ten years with the same woman (Allison Janney) has been a book editor with the same publisher for years and has an agreeably cynical daughter (Claire Danes) who is helping out on the day of the party. Her avid preparations for the celebration are a distraction from the inevitable truth that Richard is dying. Her initial scene with him where he lashes out at her in his apartment and she vibrates with hurt and rage and sadness is a master class in how an actress can calibrate a vast complex of emotions and yet seem wholly intuitive. (Ed Harris alas is as overwrought as Streep is nuanced.) Streep hasnt always worked in this way; often her technique honed her responses too finely. Whats changed here is that shes internalized so much of her characters ardent spirit that when she lets out her emotions they are already fully formed. Like the two other women Clarissa is freighted by the filmmakers with too much victimology -- her hurts are displayed as a species of heroism particular to women -- but Streeps vividness avoids easy labeling. Clarissas heroism is both mundane and thrilling She endures because finally she loves life for what it is not for what it can be. Virginia Woolf is the muse of the film and Nicole Kidman tries hard to invest her with the kind of passion and frailty that would convey both her madness and her fierce sanity. But a prosthetic nose doesnt help her performance -- she looks more like Margaret Hamilton in The Wizard of Oz than like Woolf. (If the filmmakers were so intent on getting an actress to look like Woolf they should have just hired Shelley Duvall.) The writers wounded soul is offered up to us as a kind of talisman and theres something too sacrificial too noble in such a ploy. When Woolf drowns herself it is not so much a life that has been taken away as a legend that has been born. Julianne Moore is doing a variation on the same kind of fifties repressiveness that she pulled off in Far From Heaven. (Why do so many filmmakers now have it in for the fifties?) Shes becoming too good at this sort of thing Her glazed neurasthenia in these films is very Stepford Wives-ish. Her character Laura is supposed to be fully alive only when she is reading Mrs. Dalloway. Her inner life is supposed to be her real one; the outer one which keeps cracking is just for show. But Laura doesnt seem to have much going on inside her either -- her zombification is more than skin-deep. The Hours is intended as a testament to the belief that despite appearances there are no ordinary lives. The filmmakers want us to know that if we peer deeply enough into the quotidian we will be exalted by the sheer humanity of what we find. This is certainly true of the scenes with Streeps Clarissa Vaughn but as for the other women what we are left with is a puzzling and forbidding strangeness. In Spike Lees 25th Hour written by David Benioff and based on his novel Edward Norton plays Monty Brogan a drug-dealing kingpin who is living out his last full day of freedom before being sent to prison for seven years. Living it along with him are two friends from the old days a feverish stock trader (Barry Pepper) and a schlumpy English teacher (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as well as Montys girlfriend (Rosario Dawson) and his barkeep father (Brian Cox). Monty recognizes the misery his hard-drug dealing has fostered but mostly he blames himself for being greedy and getting caught and screwing up his life. The filmmakers seem to sympathize with his attitude They de-emphasize the depredations of dope while sanctifying Monty as a self-sacrificial lamb. How bad could he be? After all he tends to wounded dogs and is a lot nicer than those burly Russian gangsters he reluctantly does business with. And he got started in the trade as a working-class Irish-American kid from Bay Ridge who was accepted into a private school and sold grass to its well-to-do students. Lee periodically flashes on New York in the throes of 9/11 for that doomy effect as if the citys distress and Montys were part of the same emotional continuum. This is romanticism of a rather low order. The only time the film really snaps out of its anti-hero-worshipy torpor is when Monty works up an aria of hate toward New York and just about everyone in it himself included. Its a multiculti litany that stretches from Pakistani cabdrivers to Hasidic diamond merchants and even though it doesnt really have much emotional connection to the Monty we see the rest of the time at least his outburst has the virtue of being outrageous in the vintage Lee manner. Its the spritz that refreshes. A lot of people including me would like to see the movie musical make a comeback but the nightmarishly frenetic Moulin Rouge didnt do it for me and neither does Chicago a reworking by director Rob Marshall and screenwriter Bill Condon of the Kander and Ebb show first staged on Broadway by Bob Fosse. Renee Zellweger is sweet as Prohibition-era starlet Roxie Hart the chorine turned celebrity murderess who in this version fantasizes the big musical numbers; but Catherine Zeta-Jones as nightclub smash Velma Kelly and Richard Gere as slick lawyer Billy Flynn are wan. The song-and-dance numbers are calisthenic but unspectacular with too much fast cutting and the tone throughout is harmlessly facetious. I realize that Fosses dark sizzle might seem a bit dated today but surely something halfway snazzy could have been devised for this movie. Its toothless. The Pianist Directed by Roman Polanski; starring Adrien Brody. The Hours Directed by Stephen Daldry; starring Meryl Streep Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore. 25th Hour Directed by Spike Lee; starring Edward Norton Philip Seymour Hoffman. Share this story...

Velma was already a showgirl; Roxie simply dreams of seeing her name in lights. And the show follows her example by imagining reality in terms of stylised song n dance numbers. How you react to the overriding lifes a show metaphor - I found it slick cynical and superficial - will matter less than how you like the tunes the hoofing and the translation of a brazenly theatrical piece into cinema. The razzmatazz songs display a certain nostalgic facility and the leads give them all theyve got. But Marshall betrays the dancing by never letting us see it properly.

(REUTERS) BY Jack Mathews NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday December 23 2002 1200 AM CHICAGO. With Renee Zellweger Catherine Zeta-Jones Richard Gere Queen Latifah. Directed by Rob Marshall. Running time 108 mins. Opening Friday. Rated PG-13 Sexual content dialogue and violence. 4 STARS. Its generally not a good idea to begin a movie musical with a show-stopper. It tends to raise audience expectations and set them up for disappointment. Not so with Rob Marshalls scintillating jazz-hot adaptation of the Broadway musical - written by John Kander and Fred Ebb and choreographed and co-written by Bob Fosse. Set in the late 20s ""Chicago"" made its debut in 1975 and began its long-legged revival at the Shubert in 1996. The movie version is jump-started with a sensationally edited crosscut montage following dancer wanna-be Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) from the theater where her vaudeville idol Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is performing ""All That Jazz"" to Roxies apartment where she has sex with a furniture salesman promising to help her career. The number and the sex end at the same time and with the same level of energy emptying the air from the theater. Before you can turn and ask the person next to you if it was as good for them as it was for you Roxie has killed this cad and sent the story hurtling forward to events equally unexpected and exhilarating. ""Chicago"" with its wafer-thin Police Gazette story line isnt going to change anyones life but for sheer audacious musical entertainment it tops last years ""Moulin Rouge"" and ranks among the greatest adapted Broadway shows ever. The original storys cynicism about crime the media and the cult of celebrity has sharpened over time thanks to our growing obsession with low-end melodrama and the haste with which bad news now travels. But just as you dont go to Chicago for the wind you dont go to the musical for the story. You watch it with your antennae up and your senses exposed. You want to feel it as much as watch it and it touches you in every way. The casting of the main characters particularly of Zellweger and Richard Gere as lawyer Billy Flynn raised some eyebrows but they deliver in triumphant fashion. Geres voice has a raspy Irish-pub quality that may scratch a few delicate CDs but works well for his blustering shyster. And Zellwegers naturally melodic voice is something of a revelation. Not that Bridget Jones has turned into Jessica Rabbit. Sexual she is. Sexy she aint. In her big number with the darkly voluptuous musically trained Zeta-Jones Zellweger looks as if shes dancing on a pair of pipe cleaners. Thats if you look. With Zeta-Jones just two gams over theres no need. The New York Daily News published this article on Dec. 23 2002. (New York Daily News) Whatever weaknesses Zellweger had after a two-month crash course on the boards theyre masked either by our eyes diversion to her dishy co-star or by the seamlessly smart editing of Martin Walsh. Walsh also works wonders with Gere especially in a scene in which he appears to be doing a nifty tap solo though we see it only in teasing glimpses between cuts to other action. However the illusions were accomplished Zellweger and Gere are fine in their musical numbers and better than that in the dramatic scenes. Zellweger easily converts her girl-next-door image to that of a dancing Eve Harrington an opportunist ready to claw her way over any obstacle - Velma mostly - that gets in her way. The two women end up in prison together each one accused of murder both defended by Flynn for whose attention they must compete. Its Roxie who shows the most moxie and after casting herself as a victim and being made over as a Breck Girl shes the national rage. In adapting the musical Marshall a choreographer (Broadways ""Cabaret"" and TVs ""Annie"" which he also directed) and screenwriter Bill Condon (""Gods and Monsters"" which he also directed) have extracted the production numbers from the book and made them fantasies that play out in the theater of Roxies imagination. So were there when Roxie triumphs onstage when the confessions of her fellow prisoners turn into smoldering condemnations of the men they killed when a press conference becomes a marionette show with Flynn literally pulling reporters strings when the corrupt-but-good-hearted prison matron (Queen Latifah like she owned the place) shares her own dreams and when Roxies cuckolded husband (John C. Reilly) laments being the invisible man. At times ""Chicago"" has the feel of a revue with the major characters taking turns at their own show-stopping numbers. If its too much of a good thing I say bring it on. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

David Ansen reviews five of the inescapablesLORD OF THE RINGS THE TWO TOWERSOpens Dec. 18 Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Gird your loins buckle your armor take a deep breath and plunge yourself into the dark fierce epic that is part two of ""The Lord of the Rings."" That Peter Jackson and his remarkable team have done it again is no surprise. Most of it was shot at the same time as the first so it wasnt apt to fall apart. Still whats remarkable is how immediately after a full year ""The Two Towers"" seizes your attention and how urgently it holds you through three seamless action-packed hours.The Fellowship had split apart when last we saw them and the new film follows three separate trails. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) heading for Mordor to destroy the Ring are joined in their quest by an emaciated suspiciously servile creature named Gollum who offers to serve as their guide. Elsewhere in Middle Earth Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) come to the aid of King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) who must defend his kingdom against Sarumans terrifying army of Orcs and Uruk-hai. In the Forest of Fangorn the two hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are rescued from their captors by an Ent named Treebeard an ancient walking and talking tree who must be persuaded to join arms with the humans the hobbits and the Elves to defend Middle Earth from the evil Sauron. At stake is... everything.""The Two Towers"" takes more liberties with Tolkien than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" did; its also more violent and nightmarish. But Jackson a master of scale and perspective doesnt let it become claustrophobic. Few people can stage a battle--and the eyepopping siege of Helms Deep is one of the most spectacular youll ever see--with such sweep and clarity that the carnage doesnt seem an oppressive end in itself. The tale never loses touch with its human core. Amid all the surreal visions terrifying monsters and overwhelming landscapes its the naked skinny schizophrenic Gollum who snakes his way most deeply into your memory. Created digitally with a motion-capture technique that mimicked the movements of actor Andy Serkis (who also supplied his hissing voice) Gollum is a previously hobbitlike creature grotesquely deformed by having once possessed the Ring. While everyone else in Tolkiens myth falls neatly into the camps of Good and Evil the self-lacerating Gollum is at war with himself. In an epic drenched in medievalism hes the dangerously ambiguous voice of the modern.GANGS OF NEW YORKOpens Dec. 20Martin Scorseses lavish wildly ambitious epic of 1860s New York takes the audience down some of the meaner streets in American history. Its set in Five Points a crime-ridden slum where recently arrived immigrants are pitted against brutally xenophobic nativists and anarchy is held at bay (just barely) by the tribal dictates of competing gangs with names like the Plug Uglies the Daybreak Boys and the Dead Rabbits. The scariest and most powerful of the local warlords is William Cutting a.k.a. Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) a one-eyed nativist who would just as soon carve up an Irishman as a slice of pork.""Gangs of New York"" culminates in the violent Draft Riots of 1863 and as a dark diligently researched history lesson it fascinates and enlightens. The problem is with the drama in the foreground. This tale of revenge in which young Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes to the Five Points to kill the Butcher--the man who murdered his father--takes a mighty long time to engage your emotions. It doesnt fully catch fire until the ""Hamlet""-like midsection when Amsterdam having been treated as a surrogate son by the unwitting Bill first tries and fails to kill him. Bills a vibrant villain and a stunningly theatrical Day-Lewis plays him to the hilt. But our hero remains one-dimensional and the usually spontaneous DiCaprio seems constrained by the part. It doesnt help that his romance with Cameron Diazs pickpocket prostitute falls back on first-they-kiss-then-they-fight cliches. Scorsese seems most engaged in the violent set pieces which have a brutal terrifying poetry. But a cloak of artifice hangs over the movie. ""Gangs"" is a dream project Scorsese has wanted to make for 30 years. You have to honor its mad ambition. But sadly it feels like a dream too long deferred.CATCH ME IF YOU CANOpens Dec. 25The teenage runaway Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a child prodigy of crime. By the time he was arrested at 21 he had cashed millions of dollars in forged checks and had successfully impersonated an airline pilot a doctor a lawyer and a university teacher with a combination of charm charisma and chutzpah. His true story (cleverly adapted by Jeff Nathanson) is the basis for former child prodigy Steven Spielbergs zippy ""Catch Me If You Can"" a delicious cat-and-mouse game flecked with intriguing Oedipal undertones.As the mercurial mouse DiCaprio sparkles far more comfortable in the ever-changing skin of this slick chameleon than he is in Scorseses epic. The dogged cat is FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (a droll buttoned-down Tom Hanks) always one methodical step behind his prey. As Hanrattys pursuit drags on from year to year his resolve never wavers but his enmity evolves into an almost paternal concern for his young foe. Meanwhile Franks real dad Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) looms behind his sons every larcenous deed. Hes a charming fast-talking failure whose slippery relationship with the truth and firm belief in the importance of appearances provide the template for his sons life of deception. Walkens performance is hilarious poignant and full of surprises.Its nice to see Spielberg in a larky relatively modest spirit. ""Catch Me"" is never less than engaging; all thats missing is a proper crescendo. The picture moves along briskly even at two and a half hours but it seems to be running on cruise control. Spielberg has caught the sunny primary-color spirit of the prewar 60s the American optimism that Frank Jr. both exemplifies and parodies. Frank lives life as if he were an actor in a movie his costumes determining his identity his fate dependent on improv with all the mundane boring parts (school job training) edited out. Like Spielberg hes a firm believer in cutting to the chase.CHICAGOOpens Dec. 25Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones put on quite a show in Rob Marshalls dazzling cinematic rethinking of the 1975 Kander and Ebb musical directed by Bob Fosse. The setting is Prohibition-era Chicago and our antiheroines are two bitter rivals aspiring singer Roxie Hart (Zellweger) and vaudeville star Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) both jailed for killing their men. Theres nothing like notoriety to jump-start a career Roxie reasons; she hires legendary lawyer Billy Flynn (a tap-dancing Richard Gere) to plead her case and parlays murder into celebrity.When I saw the 1995 Broadway revival late in its run the shows cynical bite needed dentures. Now director-choreographer Marshall screenwriter Bill Condon and a cast that includes Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly (who knew he could sing and dance?) have restored its teeth. The musical numbers are now presented as figments of Roxies spotlight-lusting imagination and the movie flows back and forth--stylishly fluidly--between reality and illusion. On the surface Zellweger isnt the tough cookie we associate with the role (a gum-chewing Ginger Rogers played her in the 1942 ""Roxie Hart"") but her veneer of vulnerability makes her venom effective. (Who knew she could sing and dance?) ""Chicago"" is exuberantly theatrical yet every inch a movie and some numbers (""The Cell Block Tango"") are so entertaining you might want to applaud. First ""Moulin Rouge"" now this. Could the movie musical be making a comeback?THE PIANISTOpens Dec. 21Roman Polanski escaped from the Cracow ghetto when he was 7 years old. Until now he has avoided making a film about the Holocaust though you could feel its shadow behind every movie he has made. ""The Pianist"" the first feature hes made in Poland since his 1962 ""Knife in the Water"" isnt autobiographical. Its based on the memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman an acclaimed concert pianist who miraculously survived the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. But you can feel it was made by a man whos been there. Its in the little details in its refusal of sentimentality in its cleareyed assessment of the depths people will descend to--Jews Poles and Germans alike--as well as the heights to which they rise.The objective tone--a detachment that contains pools of rage and sorrow--is set by Szpilman himself who never raises his voice in his memoirs. Nor does Adrien Brody who plays him here with soulful elegance. At first Szpilman is an urbane slightly aloof onlooker of the approaching nightmare. Then when he and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto the man who has everything becomes a man who has nothing. Saved from deportation to the camps by a Jewish turncoat guard--the rest of his family are not so lucky--he eventually escapes from the ghetto only to become a hunted man alone sickly hiding for his life.English playwright Ronald Harwoods screenplay sticks close to Szpilmans book showing us everything through the protagonists eyes. The Warsaw ghetto uprising is seen only as its glimpsed through the window of Szpilmans hideout just outside the ghetto walls. For long stretches of his confinement hes more a witness than a participant in the drama we see through him the spectacle of a great city reduced to physical and moral rubble. Polanski shows us shocking visions--Nazi soldiers hurling an invalid off a balcony a starving man licking spilled soup off the dirty ghetto pavement--but he never hypes up the horror for effect. ""The Pianist"" is all the more harrowing and moving for this restraint. This powerful precision-made movie offers hope as well--an act of kindness from a German officer that saves the pianists life the music that sustains his soul. In going home to tell Szpilmans story Polanski seems reborn once again hes become a filmmaker who matters.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Chicago based on Bob Fosses Broadway smash kills. Literally. Its 1920s gold diggers Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) and Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) both reached for a gun when their men done them wrong. But with the help of a slick lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) they plan to get out of the prison run by Matron Mama Thornton (Queen Latifah is a sassy wonder) by appealing to the mercy of the court and the tabloids. Jeez some things never change. Director Rob Marshall a Broadway pro with solid TV credits (Cinderella Annie) makes a smashing debut in features. And Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters) deserves cheers for a hilarious hard-assed script that sees the musical numbers as fantasies Roxies way to escape the cold cruel world. Who knew the Z in Zellweger and Zeta-Jones stood for zowie? They pour their hearts into the John Kander and Fred Ebb score (the teams best after Cabaret) and dance with flair. Did they have help in the editing? Probably. Who cares? The usually laid-back Gere really turns it on. Wait till you see him tap-dance. Leggy Zeta-Jones is so hot in the ""All That Jazz"" number shes flammable. And Zellweger defines delicious. Even when Roxie abuses her doormat husband Amos (John C. Reilly stops the show with ""Mr. Cellophane"") Zellweger wins our hearts. Thats what makes her dangerous. Just like the movie. Depraved? Id call it dynamite.

"Chicago Sings - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Gere Chicago SingsMovies - REVIEW - ChicagoFabulous And Spectacular Dont Begin To Do Justice To Grown-up Musical.January 3 2003|By Roger Moore Sentinel Staff WriterChicago as the old song goes may still be a ""toddling town."" But toddling ""the act of walking with short unsteady steps"" is the one gait Chicago the musical never puts on display during its 107 fabulous minutes.It prances. It struts. It kicks up its heels. It bumps and grinds and gyrates and works up a sweat and has a cigarette afterwards. This is a spectacular rendition of a great grown-up musical the true masterpiece from the team that also gave the world the scabrous erotic cynicism of Cabaret.And its great fun. Why wouldnt it be? The dialogue sizzles.""Youre a two-bit talent with skinny legs.""Its sexy as all get out.Its themes are as big as celebrity justice and the inequities of capital punishment and as small as the losers who only want a foot in the show biz door.And thanks to a dream cast it swings. The best that could be said for the intrepid part-time hoofers of Moulin Rouge is that they didnt embarrass themselves. In Chicago Queen Latifah Renee Zellweger John C. Reilly and most spectacularly Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere -- yes Richard Gere -- bring to mind that old theatrical label that Rita Moreno and Chita Rivera pretty much retired -- the ""triple threat"" a good actor who can sing and dance.Its about sex appeal and celebrity and the press and the justice system that operates on ""buzz"" and who has it. Whats most shocking isnt that Gere can dance or Latifah can really sing but that a show so dazzlingly and hilariously current is not just set in the Jazz Age but was first hurled onto the stage in the 1970s.Zeta-Jones co-stars as Velma half of a hit song-and-dance act that is now lacking its other half -- and a guy who came between them -- thanks to Roxies moment of murderous rage.Renee Zellweger is Roxie Hart the Broadway Baby-wannabe misused by one guy too many passing himself off as a talent scout.First one then the other winds up in the joint. With the assistance of the matron Mama Morton (Latifah) they find themselves competing for the attentions of a one-man Dream Team Billy Flynn (Gere) the one lawyer who can get them off.As they compete for Billy they compete for press. Will Chicago justice hang them by their pretty necks breaking precedence? Plainly the one without the public relations juice is a goner. All of the women on death row make this abundantly clear in the sensational ""Cell Block Tango"" number.Theres also Roxies cuckolded husband (Reilly) ignored to the point he must sing the classic lament ""Mr. Cellophane.""And thats just the lament. This is the show ""All That Jazz"" exploded from a nearly surreal song-and-dance trip that incorporates both numbers set within a nightclub and tunes that break the barrier between realistic characters and folks who give their inner voices a tune.First-time director Rob Marshall a choreographer has taken this Bob Fosse-launched spectacular back to the future. Its danced as if Fosse were still living and finding new ways to make choreography sexy and filmed as if Fosse had worked into the age of MTV. Its a traditional musical only in the sense that Marshall knows how to let the songs and the dances tell the story and he knows how to photograph gorgeous bodies in motion.Zellweger is delightful as the naive young thing who quickly masters the system. Gere is cynicism incarnate perfectly willing to give Billy the meanness that makes him work and just as willing to do a little of the old soft shoe when called for. Latifahs ""When Youre Good to Mama Mamas Good to You"" is a real show-stopper.But Zeta-Jones simply dazzles. From the sexy glower under her flapper haircut all the way down her fabulous gams she is every inch Velma.Check your prejudice at the door you know the one about musicals and how theres no way youre sitting through hills alive with Julie Andrews or Gene Kelly prancing through mud puddles. This isnt that kind of musical. You are going to toddle out of Chicago in a feverish sweat needing a cigarette.

Reilly; Director Rob Marshall; Author Bill Condon; Release Date Limited 12/27/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 108; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Miramax Posted January 17 2003 -- 1200 AM EST This acridly exhilarating adaptation of Bob Fosses 1975 Broadway musical is an ode to the intertwined glories of sex showmanship and lying - i.e. ""the old razzle-dazzle."" The heroine Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a Kewpie-doll 20s nobody who shoots her lover at point-blank range and ends up on Murderess Row. There she meets her idol the vaudeville star Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) as well as Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) a lawyer with corrupt dimples who turns Roxie into a tabloid celebrity. In its caustic high-spirited way the movie presents us with a vision of women who will do anything to break free of the conventionality imposed by men. Bravado is all - far more vital than morality - and the result leaves you thrilled at how good it feels to see life death and girl power turned once again into a cabaret.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 27 2002 602 PM Cell Block Tango Chicago reduces our critic to a finger-snappin toe-tappin fool. By David Edelstein Zellwegers charming vamp Rob Marshalls film of Chicago (Miramax) isnt just the most explosively entertaining movie musical in a couple of decades. Its going to be the most influential the one that inspires the rebirth of the Hollywood musical that leaves audiences everywhere wanting more dancing more singing--more more more Its a more-ish kind of picture. Every number is a showstopper. Every performer is working at the top of his or her game. The story of Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) the hopeful chorine whose 1929 killing of her duplicitous lover proves to be her ticket to tabloid stardom simply bowls you over. At the huge press screening that I (and the rest of the New York media) flocked to in early December we were transformed into a bunch of musical-comedy queens on the verge of tearing the place apart. If the cast had shown up wed have stormed the stage ""Renee have my baby"" ""Catherine Michael doesnt love you like I love you"" ""John C. Reilly ... Gee youre in a lot of movies these days ..."" Advertisement Who would have thought that a movie-star sex goddess like Catherine Zeta-Jones would also be a belter that shed have the hunger of such rapacious musical-comedy creatures as Chita Rivera--who played her part in the original Bob Fosse production (which I saw twice in the mid-70s)? As Velma Kelly who finds her sister and her husband together in bed shoots them both then confidently strides onstage to do the scintillating vamp anthem ""All That Jazz"" (""Im gonna rouge my knees/ and roll my stockings down ..."") Zeta-Jones has a smoldering confidence that takes your mind off her not-always-fluid dancing--although shes a perfectly fine hoofer with majestic limbs and a commanding cleavage. It doesnt really matter that shes no Chita (or Gwen Verdon or Ann Reinking) because these dances are cut into lots of small pieces instead of long takes--and if these actors wouldnt survive a Broadway marathon (or a one-fluid-shot Fred-and-Ginger dance) theyre positively electric in the sprints. Besides its fun to see movie stars pull off big musical-comedy numbers--to see that Zellwegers smeary-eyed sweetness comes through when she sings and that she can play a selfish little tramp like Roxie Hart (who tries to pin her murder on her sap husband played by John C. Reilly) without making you adore her one drop less than when she was the snortingly tremulous Bridget Jones. Queen Latifah reigns in prison and song You couldnt guess that Richard Gere--as Roxies sharpy lawyer Billy Flynn--would be so ingratiating a song-and-dance man or that when he sang out hed have that silly back-of-the-palate tremolo like Anthony Newley (with a touch of Jerry Lewis). It helps that the supporting players (Queen Latifah as the big-mama matron of female prison Christine Baranski as a snooty trial/gossip columnist) have proven musical chops and that the company of singers and dancers are simply the snazziest in the biz. When a succession of convicted murderesses (among them Roxanne Barlow Ekaterina Chtchelkanova and Jayne Eastwood) hurl themselves into ""He Had It Coming"" in the Cook County Prison every verse stops the show. As designed by John Myrhe and photographed by Dion Beebe Chicago is occasionally an eyesore. Geres ""Razzle-Dazzle"" done as a three-ring circus under red and green lights looks especially ugly and cluttered. And the numbers are mostly in the Benihana school--chop chop chop chop and a lot of fluttering limbs. I usually hate that style--its what drove me nuts about the dancing in last years monument to attention-deficit disorder Moulin Rouge But director Rob Marshall is also a choreographer and if he edits too much he has learned from Fosse to edit in synch with the dancing--to make the cut an extension of the dance gesture. (Think of the way that Fosse edited ""Mein Herr"" or the title song in Cabaret [1972]--thats the model.) It helps that Chicago isnt a ""realistic"" musical in the movie-musical-killing tradition of Oklahoma (OK thats a provocative statement and needs some elaboration. I like Oklahoma fine but this so-called 40s ""coming of age"" of the Broadway musical was an aberrant outgrowth of stage naturalism which attempted to foster an illusion of seamlessness and which has mostly shackled performers to cornball realistic plots. Think of Shirley Jones in all those deadly Rodgers and Hammerstein adaptations or Julie Andrews in anything--its no mystery why the musical died.) Anyway Chicago is a quasi-Brechtian vaudeville--the sort of movie in which the numbers are presented as numbers. Marshall and screenwriter Bill Condon have given the film at least two levels the racy 20s tabloid melodrama of jazz murderesses; and the world of the vaudeville stage in which an emcee/bandleader (Taye Diggs) introduces each number as an opportunity for the character to express his or her innermost self. The musical with its marvelous score by John Kander and Fred Ebb was engineered to Fosses talents. Every number is in a different vaudeville style from the Jolson-esque ""Mr. Cellophane"" (in which John C. Reilly proves to be a lyrically dopey crooner) to Flynns soft-shoe declaration of showbiz cynicism ""Razzle-Dazzle."" Chicago wears its showbiz cynicism with gaudy pride. The central conflict is between Roxie and the simmering prima donna Velma to see who will emerge the bigger murderess/star. Which means that Chicago is one of the rare musical comedies (Gypsy is another) to tell the truth about the people who compete for your entertainment dollars. It says that musical-comedy bitches and bastards will do anything for a showstopper--even kill you. Chicago kills. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Perhaps all we needed was another Cabaret. With Chicago this holiday seasons most razzle-dazzle entertainment weve got it. If movie musicals are staging a comeback last years song-stealing Moulin Rouge was just the start. With its strong original songs and Broadway showmanship Chicago has the theatrical chops a true renaissance requires. Credit should be sprayed as widely as the rat-a-tat gunfire of its done-wrong dames who shoot their men and use media-circus notoriety to spark not just acquittal but show-biz ascension. When it bowed on Broadway in 1975 Chicago -- with its fame games at any price -- was a dark evocation of post-Watergate cynicism. Today its a timely spin on the shamelessness of a Jerry Springer world where notoriety is mistaken for celebrity and infamy for self-worth. The casting is star-driven but only to a point. Though Catherine Zeta-Jones as vaudeville vet Velma Kelly and Renee Zellweger as wannabe Roxie Hart lack the knock-em-dead snap and polish of stage regulars each is a revelation as a singer and hoofer and both have the acting ability to carry their characters no small feat in itself. Richard Gere is almost as much of a slam-shut case as their attorney smoothly undaunted Billy Flynn. He sings and tap dances well enough and gets to show his neglected comic twinkle. But the chief credit beyond composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb goes to screenwriter Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters) and first-time film director Rob Marshall a musical-theater pro whose vision and passion got the ball rolling. From its jaunty score and smoky-nightclub motifs to its robust and vibrant dancing their Chicago evokes Cabaret while also carving its own Jazz-Age identity. The shows also share a bloodline with late great director-choreographer Bob Fosse. But for Marshall Fosses carnal undulations are just a touchstone for wildly inventive set pieces rippling with imagination -- and not a single special effect. As much as any computer-animated spectacle Chicago paints the screen with creative detail -- all live and on camera. Smart crafty and superbly executed it flies by so fast youll want to watch it again as soon as the credits crawl. Marshalls key move was setting Chicagos vaudeville-style numbers separately from dialogue scenes. Onstage Chicago is like a musical revue tied with thin plot threads. Here its songs dont burst from conversation but play independently as elaborate projections of Roxies stage-obsessed fantasies. Theres no denying All That Jazz is the big showstopper and Zeta-Jones delivers it with whiplash conviction in a brash lusty production number. As for Zellweger you name it she nails it both as budding vamp and lovable underdog. Shes oddly innocent despite plugging her boyfriend. John C. Reilly also earns sympathy as Roxies sad disdained husband whose plaintive Mr. Cellophane is a heartbreaker. And the warmly earthy Queen Latifah a shrewd casting choice for the prison matron shines on When Youre Good to Mama. Smaller players also steal moments from Taye Diggs as the Cabaret-style emcee to a leggy ensemble attacking the girl-power Cell Block Tango with vengeful pop and precision. Their sexy costumes are anachronistic but why quibble? At a time when murder was lurid entertainment these Chicagoans thirsted for cool booze and hot scandal. You think theyd resist leather-strapped cleavage? With few respites Marshall keeps the energy humming and his edits unlike those in Moulin Rouge are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it. This then is the show for those who grew up loving movie musicals in which going over a rainbow took only the leap of faith that a heartfelt song could make happen. It still can today thanks to artists who clearly respect that tradition while giving it new life and fresh hope. For all its shysters shams and sheer razzle-dazzle Chicago at long last is the real thing.

Reilly Taye Diggs Christine Baranski. Directed by Rob Marshall from a screenplay by Bill Condon based on a play by Maurine Watkins and a stage musical by John Kander Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse. 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content and dialogue violence and thematic elements. Guild 45th Pacific Place. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger in a wavy 20s bob that sets off her wounded-cameo face) watches Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) sing ""All That Jazz"" on a low-rent Chicago stage. We dont yet know Roxie but we see desperation in her eyes -- an inner jazz baby screaming to get out. And as Velma reaches for that showstopping final note -- ""all ... that ... "" Roxie whos suddenly taken the stage in her own mind snatches it from her ""JAAAAAAZZZZ"" Its a hell of a wail from such a tiny woman and it jolts us up in our seats -- Roxies inner musical and ours has been unleashed. Rob Marshalls concept for bringing Bob Fosses steamy musical to the screen is a simple one Rather than trying to pass off real people suddenly bursting into song and dance (which can work just fine in the artificial realm of a stage but is problematic on screen) hes set the songs within a framework of Roxies imagination -- this mousy little woman is the star of the musical in her own head. Its similar to the way Fosse himself transformed Harold Princes ""Cabaret"" for the screen some 30 years ago by putting its musical numbers into a logical context (in that case on the stage of the Kit Kat Klub) and it works splendidly. (Marshall a successful Broadway director making his feature-film debut here is best known for directing the recent revival of ""Cabaret."" Anybody want to play Six Degrees of Broadway Musicals? No? Oh well.) Not that the nonmusical portions of ""Chicago"" have much to do with reality; this is razzle-dazzle all the way and probably the most fun Ive had at the movies all year. Based (rather loosely I imagine) on a 1920s play written by Chicago Tribune reporter Maurine Watkins its the story of how Roxie Hart -- a nobody who wants to be a star -- cheats on her husband shoots her lover manipulates the press and lives happily ever after. Its fluff with a bite; an exercise in happy cynicism dressed up in fishnet stockings sultry chemises and rapid-fire editing (not quite at the flash speed of ""Moulin Rouge"" but not too far off either). Marshalls dances arent quite Fosse (see sidebar) but they show the master choreographers influence everywhere as does the cinematography -- the camera often seems to be squeezing in as if shooting in a small space bringing us closer to the movement. The vampy silhouettes of ""The Cell Block Tango"" here recall the women of ""Hey Big Spender"" in Fosses ""Sweet Charity"" -- leggy and threatening as they pose in a line sharply defined by the camera. ""Chicago"" celebrates endless arms and legs clothed (barely) in Fosse black; the choreography alternates between erotic jazz and bouncy 20s tap and its the best movie dancing in years. And Zellweger an unlikely musical star gives the performance of a lifetime. (Is there anything this woman cant do?) Her soulful voice perfectly suits Marshalls concept; shes not a trained Broadway belter but sounds like she just woke up one day decided to sing and found that she loved it. Writhing on a piano in ""Funny Honey"" or vamping like Marilyn Monroe in ""Roxie"" she savors each word as if its a delicious piece of candy. She plays Roxie as an innocent tootsie caught up in events beyond her control -- until you look a little closer at those china-blue eyes. Zeta-Jones a former West End hoofer has found the perfect vehicle for her scary-kitty-cat persona; here she sings and dances as if her career depended on it (which it does) and shes mesmerizing. Queen Latifah is terrifically sassy and sexy as jail matron Mama Morton; John C. Reilly sweetly abashed as Roxies hapless husband. And while I might quibble with the slightly schmaltzy singing style affected by Richard Gere as Roxies suave lawyer -- it makes him seem a tad too old for his role -- he exudes lightfooted charm. Overall ""Chicago"" earns that highest of praises -- I cant wait to see it again. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.

HANDOUT PHOTO/Photo Credits David James Photo HANDOUT Image 2 of 2 - - Thats showbiz / Chicago sparkles with sexy women jazz energy and spectacular numbers 1 / 2 Back to Gallery CHICAGO Musical. Starring Renee Rene Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Rob Marshall. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A lackluster year in movies is redeeming itself in its waning days with a number of top-shelf releases -- not the least of which is ""Chicago"" the movie version of the old Bob Fosse musical which had a big Broadway revival in 1996. The movie is a total blast and what a surprise. In recent years the most popular musicals have been kitschy Disney animations or grand but apologetic efforts like Baz Luhrmanns ""Moulin Rouge"" or Kenneth Branaghs ""Loves Labours Lost"" -- both of those tried to atone for the artificiality of the form by casting people who couldnt sing. By contrast ""Chicago"" is everything a musical is supposed to be with good songs (by John Kander and Fred Ebb) sung by people who sing well and with lots of sexy dances featuring women who are gorgeous and men who dont get in the way. First to dispense with the big questions so no one has to skip ahead Can Renee Zellweger who plays showgirl-murderer Roxie Hart sing and dance? Yes and charmingly. How about Catherine Zeta-Jones who plays showgirl-murderer Velma Kelly? Absolutely. And Richard Gere as the lawyer? Yes. Him too. For some reason Gere has an English accent when he sings -- maybe he listened to too many Anthony Newley records over the years -- but he can carry a tune and he can even tap-dance. So ""Chicago"" is well served by the cast and the cast is in turn well served by director Rob Marshall who has never made a film before but hits a home run his first time out. Though the stage show took place entirely in a nightclub in the 1920s Marshall liberates ""Chicago"" from its single set while not ""opening it up"" so much that it dies. His innovation is simple and brilliant For every musical number (except the first and last) we see life presented on parallel tracks -- as its happening in the real world and as its happening in the mind of Roxie who imagines herself and other characters singing in a noisy music hall. The opening number is a dazzlement that lets us know were in good hands. Zeta-Jones as Velma stashes her murder weapon and goes out onstage to perform ""All That Jazz."" During Velmas pumped-up number -- in which the choreography gets increasingly erotic the orchestration more grand and the editing more vigorous -- we see Roxie leaving the music hall with her lover and bringing him home to her bed. The music becomes a comment on the sex and the sex a comment on the music. Marshall cuts back and forth from Velma to Roxie and sets down in those minutes what well soon see are the essential elements of 1920s Chicago fast women sudden violence and all that jazz. Soon Velma and Roxie are both in the same jail each for a crime of passion. Velma is a celebrity prisoner with a high-priced mouthpiece Billy Flynn (Gere) whos guaranteed to get her off while Roxie is a little nobody headed for the gallows. She gets wise and hires Flynn herself and starts rivaling Velma for headlines. The goal for both is fame at any price and then parlaying that fame into a lucrative showbiz career. Zellweger is a joy to watch with marvelous comic timing and in her stage numbers a commanding presence. Im beginning to wonder whether theres anything she cant do. Zeta-Jones is an Ava Gardner-like beauty whos even more beautiful than the original and has a strong low voice. She doesnt have the comic quality of Bebe Neuwirth who played Velma onstage but thats not really a criticism. Zeta-Jones is just a different kind of Velma. The supporting cast members all get their moments -- Queen Latifah as the prison matron (singing ""When Youre Good to Mama"") John C. Reilly as Roxies husband (""Mr. Cellophane""). In addition to singing and dancing Gere does some nice character work as a genial master manipulator all surface all phony but a decent fellow underneath. He has a terrific take in the moment just before he and Roxie go into court. She says shes scared and for just a second a look crosses his eyes as if hes forgotten that anyone could be scared. He knows its all a show. ""Chicago"" is a lighthearted work but it captures some of the pulse of urban America in the 1920s an era energized by new diversions such as jazz records new categories such as media celebrity and new discoveries such as liberated female sexuality. In the song ""Nowadays"" a chorus sings ""In 50 years or so/ Its all gonna change you know?"" In fact it has been been about 75 years now and it hasnt changed much. To see ""Chicago"" is to be glad about that. . This film contains sexual situations and violence.

Droll Billy sells the films style-over-substance philosophy in one musical couplet ""Give em an act with lots of flash in it/The reaction will be passionate""First-time feature filmmaker Rob Marshall (who directed the TV version of Annie) makes this lyric his mantra in adapting the stage show with its jazzy juicy Kander amp; Ebb score to the screen.In Marshalls virtuoso hands this movie version of the 1975 Bob Fosse Broadway musical based on the 1942 Ginger Rogers movie Roxie Hart based on the 1926 play Chicago the rhinestones shimmer like diamonds and brass glows like solid gold.And while were on the subject of showbiz alchemy Here Gere flexes the caddish muscles of Gene Kelly Zellweger radiates the flirty moxie of Shirley MacLaine and Catherine Zeta-Jones (as murderess Velma Kelly) slinks like no one since Cyd Charisse.Who knew these least-likely musical stars possessed such pipes (particularly Zeta-Jones) and a talent for pirouettes? So what if they had help from the latest sound and computer-image techno-wizards - the three leads acquit themselves like seasoned musical headliners.(In the 70s the proposed film adaptation of Chicago was to star Goldie Hawn and Liza Minnelli as Roxie and Velma; by the 90s Madonna and Hawn were to play the killer-dillers. But Z-girls Zellweger and Zeta-Jones are so good that its hard to think of anyone else on screen in the roles originated on Broadway by Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera.)The tarnished moral of this amorality tale set in the 20s but satirizing the present is that celebrity is everything and everyone - including murderesses can be a celeb. But its the messenger of the moral that interests Marshall How music exalts the drab everyday into something glamorous.This also was the objective of Herbert Ross underseen Pennies from Heaven (1981) and the Dennis Potter television series that inspired it. But Marshall working from a screenplay by Bill Condon sharpens the edginess of the Fosse play by setting the entire story in the imagination of Roxie. Since the musical numbers are projections of Roxies fame fever - indeed the whole movie is the extended hallucination of a would-be chorine who becomes famous by infamously murdering her lover - there is never the awkward moment of a character breaking into song.Cheers for the three principals. Bravo for Martin Walshs editing with its lightning electricity. Huzzahs for the supporting performances of Queen Latifah as a prison warden whos a cross between Pearl Bailey and Mae West and for John C. Reilly as Roxies husband Amos a man so invisible he dubs himself in the films most plaintively funny song ""Mr. Cellophane.""And throw bouquets at Marshall who instead of dissecting it to death neatly resurrects the Hollywood musical.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.Chicago  1/2Produced by Marty Richard and Harvey Weinstein directed by Rob Marshall written by Bill Condon based on the play Chicago by Maurine Dallas Watkins and the musical by Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse photography by Dion Beebe music by John Kander distributed by Miramax Films.Running time 1 hour 53 mins.Roxie Hart. . .

"Jazzed on Chicago washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Jazzed on Chicago Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 27 2002 THIS IS a road to Damascus story. See I wasnt holding my breath over ""Chicago."" Didnt care one way or the other if Renee Zellweger would butterfly into a stage dancer or that Catherine Zeta-Jones had considerable song-and-dance experience. And the thought of a slick-haired Richard Gere tap dancing across the screen was about as appealing as two hours with Yanni. As far as I was concerned this was going to be ""Oral Surgery -- the Musical."" I didnt expect to come out of the thing singing and dancing -- or wanting to. And so here I am surprised to be turned on my head and telling you how much I enjoyed the film. Not since the 1972 ""Cabaret"" has there been a movie musical this stirring intelligent and exciting. The choreography -- by director Rob Marshall and Cynthia Onrubia -- is inspired. But that choreography doesnt end there. Screenwriter Bill Condons ingenious structuring the sizzling wit of the original book (based on the 1975 musical by John Kander Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse) Martin Walshs fluid editing Dion Beebes dynamic camera and lighting schemes and production designer John Myhres atmospheric Prohibition-era sets -- these are all part of the visual tango. Best of all theres a story here an entertaining yarn set in the Windy City of the late 1920s -- the heyday of gangsterism smoky jazz clubs and police-blotter infamy. Chicago starlet Roxie Hart (Zellweger) dreams of making it big in vaudeville like her idol Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones). But Roxies ambitions are derailed when shes hauled in for murder. Disenchanted with her marriage to well-meaning duffer Amos (John C. Reilly) she has become involved with another man Fred Casely (Dominic West). But when she realizes how much Freds using her Roxie shoots him dead. Surprise surprise. Velmas in the slammer too for icing her husband and her sister. And Velmas being represented by slick superlawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) who turns the most hopeless blood-soaked defense into a cause celebre. He never loses. The enterprising Roxie pays off the prisons Matron Morton (Queen Latifah) for an audience with Billy and gets the sensation-seeker to represent her. But when Billys fickle interest flags Roxie ups the ante by pretending to be pregnant. A woman accused of murder And pregnant in prison -- not necessarily by her husband Billy decides to take this case all the way. ""Chicago"" based on the current Broadway musical goes way back. It started as Maurine Watkinss 1920s play ""The Brave Little Woman"" and there were two film adaptations (most notably the 1942 ""Roxie Hart"" starring Ginger Rogers) before the 1975 musical. And then came the musicals further success on Broadway in the 1990s. The latest movie combines the best of everything Watkinss Chicago fable the lyrics and melody Fosses choreography and all the bells and whistles of snappy moviemaking. Its entertainment in the old style but retrofitted with witty toe-tapping cynicism. And its a prescient metaphor for Americas susceptibility to fame (or infamy) and media manipulation from the O.J. Simpson trial to the Florida Recount Follies. And yes Zellweger does transform into a dancing butterfly. Shes terrific as Roxie the starlet wholl stop at nothing to be the talk of the town. (Eve of ""All About Eve"" eat your heart out.) Zeta-Jones is assured and sexy in the classic Hollywood diva sense. And Gere a musician and veritable hoofer more than completes the marquee package. Maybe no movie could ever hold a candle to the great musicals of the past the ones starring Fred Astaire Gene Kelly Ginger Rogers and Donald OConnor. But at least ""Chicago"" lights the wick. CHICAGO (PG-13 107 minutes) -- Contains sexual content obscenity and violence. Area theaters.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Chicago Movies Entertainment News The legs go on for a mile and a half in ""Chicago"" -- Catherine Zeta Jones take up the first mile and Renee Zellwegers the extra half. But the two actresses who play Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart in Rob Marshalls devilishly grand movie version of the Bob Fosse Broadway musical are equals in all other respects. They balance each other wonderfully and it doesnt hurt that Marshall orchestrates everything else around them with near perfection ""Chicago"" has almost single-handedly resurrected the tradition of the movie musical a genre that has for the most part languished since its last great masterpiece Herbert Rosss 1981 ""Pennies From Heaven"" which didnt attract the audience it should have. ""Chicago"" is sophisticated brash sardonic completely joyful in its execution. It gives anyone who ever loved movie musicals and lamented their demise something to live for. Marshall is a first-time director whose other movie work has been as a choreographer. Choreographers have to understand composition what the body can and cant do how arcs of movement mesh together seamlessly or disconnect and of course how to conjoin movement with music so that the two seem inseparable. Marshall has the advantage of having a great eye as well He seems to instinctively understand the link between physical and visual movement in the movies. (Fosse himself started out as a choreographer.) Marshalls picture is an object lesson in the ways a whole movie can be considered a dance routine You need an instinct for pacing a sense of what goes where and when an understanding of where action must build and where it must recede and a firm idea of where in each frame you want to draw the eye. (Do you want your audience to drink in the complete spectacle of a stage full of dancers or is it time to narrow the focus on one fabulously garter-belted set of stems?) Marshall pulls it all together in ""Chicago"" in a way thats suitably Fosse-like but also bears his own stamp of individuality. Its editing by Martin Walsh at first seems a little busy but once you learn to trust it you see how crucial it is to the movies energy and lightness. And ""Chicago"" doesnt bother to ratchet up the irony quotient to underscore the applicability of this sarcastic little tale of media manipulation at the beginning of the 21st century because Marshall knows he doesnt have to. The material speaks for itself. Fosses musical was based on a 20s era play by court reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins (it was turned into the 1942 Ginger Rogers movie ""Roxie Hart""); Fosse and Fred Ebb reworked it and Ebb and John Kander wrote the musical numbers. (The movies sleek screenplay was written by Bill Condon director of ""Gods and Monsters."") ""Chicago"" is the story of a cute but tough jazz-age show-biz wannabe Roxie Hart who kills her lover in a fit of jealousy and while awaiting trial lands in the same jail where one of her idols from the stage Velma Kelly is awaiting trial for killing her husband and sister (who were doing her wrong). Advised by the slick nobodys-fool prison matron ""Mama"" Morton (here played by Queen Latifah) Roxie persuades her gentle devoted milquetoast husband Amos (John C. Reilly) to raise enough money to hire hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) to get her off the hook. Flynn launches a publicity campaign that turns Roxie into a media darling -- and enrages Velma also one of Flynns clients because it draws attention away from her own case. And Roxie not content to just lap up the attention embellishes it with her own sympathy-milking P.R. touches including a faux pregnancy. The movies spectacular lineup of actors dont try to soften the glare of the story. Its still bitter and hard-edged and deliciously entertaining for it. Marshall knows exactly how to stage ensemble numbers like ""Cell Block Tango"" in which Roxie and Velmas fellow prisoners explicate their innocence in song. (Their unifying refrain is ""He had it coming"") Those numbers are dazzling without feeling too busy ; they engage and exhilarate without overwhelming us. The mood and tone of ""Chicago"" are very different from those of ""Pennies From Heaven"" but I wouldnt be surprised if Marshall had been somewhat inspired by Rosss picture. Even in the midst of the vibrancy of ""Chicago"" Marshall like Ross understands how to frame his visuals with an intense and quiet delicacy when its called for as when Roxie sings her ode to her loyal-pup husband ""Funny Honey."" The sequence melds reality with fantasy in a way that makes Roxies put-on sensitivity seem almost believable -- until of course she reverts to her usual state of conniving self-absorption. You Might Also Like Every actor in ""Chicago"" seems clued-in to the movies purpose and vision working together and separately to keep it moving at a clip. Richard Geres Flynn is slick wily and charming in exactly the right proportions. And although I suspect his tap-dancing routine in ""Razzle Dazzle"" was carefully edited to disguise the fact that the truly fancy footwork wasnt his own it doesnt much matter -- Gere has the legs and maybe more significantly the face of an old-time tap dancer so the flim-flam works. John C. Reilly is astonishing (although really when is he ever not?) as Amos and he carries his small-but-big number ""Mr. Cellophane"" easily and beautifully. And Queen Latifah as the prison matron is intimidatingly sexy in the best way Marshall and the gifted cinematographer Dion Beebe shoot her number ""When Youre Good to Mama"" in burnished but brilliant golds that pick up the honey in her skin -- a visual counterpart to the honey in her voice. (I would have loved to have seen Latifah and Catherine Zeta Jones duet on the shows wonderful subtle as a hooker in a cathedral ""Class"" which doesnt appear in this ""Chicago."" But you cant have everything.) And how about those girls? I know theres a feminist commandment that forbids calling anyone over the age of 16 a girl but Im ready to take the heat because in this context Zeta-Jones and Zellweger simply are girls in the classic show-business sense. Zeta-Jones in her sleek ebony bob is so offhandedly funny and sexy (and just a little nasty) that she wins the blackest wickedest parts of our hearts immediately. (She can sing and dance too. Its about time someone gave this former Welsh national tap dancing champion a chance to show off.) And Zellweger who can also sing and dance is just a mighty-mite Her Roxie has a halo of platinum curls a face like a cherub and the will of one of those outlawed iron-jawed animal traps. The two characters play their toughness and their fabulous good looks against one another as if it were all just a game. Zeta-Jones is sleek foxy icicle-cool; Zellweger is compact muscular the mouse that growled. Watching them together (as well as separately) is pure pleasure; theyre visions of calculating naughtiness in chemises and tap shoes. ""Chicago"" innovative as it is didnt spring from a vacuum. There have been a few good and even close to great movie musicals in the past 20 years. Baz Lurhman deserves all the credit hes gotten for exploding the movie-musical genre with the messy but heartfelt ""Moulin Rouge""; I love Jacques Rivettes 1995 ""Haut/Bas/Fragile"" a movie too few people have had the chance to see; and I always stand up for Kenny Ortegas much-maligned 1992 ""Newsies"" a purely traditional musical with the right sense of energy and spirit. (And doesnt it strike anyone else as ballsy that Ortega should have made a pro-labor musical for the Walt Disney Company?) But I think ""Chicago"" represents an even sharper angle of what Luhrmann started. Its a courageous picture and an ambitious one that lives up to its goals. Fosses ""Chicago"" opened in 1975 to fairly lukewarm reviews from critics who were turned off by Fosses cynicism but audiences certainly took to it. This ""Chicago"" is without a doubt designed to be a crowd pleaser. Yet it never panders to us; it doesnt clutter up the screen just so well have a million things to look at every minute (something so many Broadway musicals get wrong these days; its as if they have to exhaust you to fool you into thinking youve gotten your moneys worth). Marshalls ""Chicago"" might have made a hundred small mistakes and at least a dozen fatal ones; instead it moves along with more grace and agility and verve than we might have dared to expect. This dry cynical fable about the currency of celebrity is actually one of the most hopeful movies of the year Now we know theres somebody out there who still knows how to make em.

Running time 108 minutes. Rated PG-13 (innuendo). At the Ziegfeld West 54th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues. WITHOUT a doubt the best movie musical since ""Cabaret"" ""Chicago"" improves upon the long-running Broadway show by Kander and Ebb in many ways. The plot makes more sense. There are characters you can feel for. And theres now an overarching theme - societys appetite for spectacle - that seems better fitted to our era. Whats missing in the screen version directed by Rob Marshall and written by Richard Condon is the dark minimalist sexiness of Bob Fosses shoulder-rolling hip-canting choreography especially in scenes that involve the whole chorus - and at least for this critic Bebe Neuwirth and Ann Reinking who played the lead roles in the 1997 revival. But its worth the sacrifice for an experience that thanks to the ingeniousness of the filmmakers and the nature of the medium itself is simply richer and more satisfying. Condon and Marshall cleverly make it clear that many of the musical numbers are taking place in the imagination of ""Chicago"" protagonist Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger). You first meet Roxie a would-be showgirl in Prohibition-era Chicago together with her lover Fred (Dominic West fresh from his triumph in TVs ""The Wire"") watching vaudeville star Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) on stage. When Fred brutally dumps her Roxie shoots him dead in the flat she shares with her sad-sack husband Amos (John C. Reilly) - and she ends up in the same jail as Kelly who is also charged with murder (she killed her husband and sister after catching them in the act). To avoid the gallows both must compete for the affections of prison matron Mama Morton (Queen Latifah) star lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) - and the Windy Citys salivating press. From her sensational opening number ""All That Jazz"" Zeta-Jones reveals herself to be a first-class dancer and singer. Zellweger also unexpectedly wonderful is given less dancing to do but succeeds in bringing vulnerability to a character who would otherwise be merely a killer floozy. (Its a shame shes too mannishly skinny for the period to play the kind of bombshell her character is supposed to be.) And Gere even if it isnt him tap-dancing during Condons clever new courtroom scene (you cant tell because of the MTV-esque quick cutting) is funnier than you would ever expect. But the standout performance in ""Chicago"" is almost certainly that of Latifah Her cynical but alluring Mama Morton is an unalloyed triumph. Though a thrilling ride ""Chicago"" still has nothing on classic movie musicals like ""An American in Paris."" For some reason the people who make modern musicals dont like to let you watch dancers dance. In ""Moulin Rouge"" for instance the cameras movements obscured those of the dancers whose limbs were cut off at the knee or hip. Though this is less true of ""Chicago"" there are still too few moments when you get to enjoy choreography from a dancers hands to her feet. And for some reason the director feels obliged to speed up the film during some of the dance sequences as if his team couldnt quite keep up with the music.

But its at least a surefire Oscar hopeful given the best-picture nomination that went to vocally inferior Moulin Rouge last year. Who would have known? Renee and Catherine can really belt it out (and Richards not too shabby either). When two major stars are unexpectedly cast as 1920s chorines --and they know how to sing -- its immediately obvious that year-end movie showmanship isnt limited to the hobbits or those Martin Scorsese gangs of a rival city. Review of the movie Chicago ( out of four) Stars Renee Zellweger Catherine Zeta-Jones Richard Gere Queen Latifah John C. Reilly Christine Baranski Director Rob Marshall Distributor Miramax RatingPG-13 for sexual content and dialogue violence and thematic elements Opens Friday in select cities More than any other example in recent memory Chicago shows how much the element of surprise is missing from todays movies. Right off the bat we get Catherine Zeta-Jones belting up a storm with All That Jazz. Its part of the basic Zeta-Jones bio that she can really sing and wow can she. But wait. Renee Zellweger vocalizing too and more than acceptably? Plus Richard Gere singing pretty well and even tap-dancing? Yep its true -- even if it is a minor frustration that director Rob Marshall at times employs flashy editing plus blue smoke and mirrors to keep us from seeing everything we want to see. Launched on stage in 1975 Chicago was refashioned to greater acclaim in 1996. A silent film in 1927 it was also the source of 1942s non-musical Roxie Hart which has been airing on cable this month. Ginger Rogers was terrific as Roxie and so is Zellweger as a married stage-struck type who reaps and then revels in publicity after shooting her lover dead by the bed and landing behind bars. Here the movie finds a different kind of bang thanks to Zeta-Jones. Dressed in pokey garb more provocative than Cook Countys standard issue she too has an amorously inspired rubout on her resume. You might assume that a prison setting could cramp a musicals style even if Queen Latifah does play the matron. But the numbers are effectively staged as cabaret-style imaginings in the characters minds. Gere plays a celebrity mouthpiece whos as skillful at getting his fee as knowing how to ""play"" juries predisposed to acquitting cute assailants. This is a film in which nearly everyone is cynical. Unlike a lot of stage-to-screen musicals Chicago keeps it short -- less than two hours -- but still finds time for a song by busy character actor John C. Reilly. (Hes also in The Hours and Gangs of New York.) If youre a guy you sit through this movie thinking ""What I really want is for it to wrap up with the two Z-ladies decked out in sexy duds and together on stage."" Well guess what? You just got your late Christmas present.

"Its not Fosses town but Chicago still has a kick - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | REVIEW Its not Fosses town but Chicago still has a kickRob Marshalls film version of the sizzling play owes a lot to the fierce energy of Catherine Zeta-Jones.December 27 2002|Manohla Dargis | Times Staff Writer Ever since she landed in Hollywood a couple years back the Welsh-born actress Catherine Zeta-Jones has been playing the part of an old-fashioned star with a vengeance. She made a splash in silly (but lucrative) entertainments like ""The Mask of Zorro"" and ""Entrapment"" in which she confidently flaunted her lush physicality only to turn around and flex her acting chops with a supporting role in Steven Soderberghs ""Traffic."" Few moments in that film were as shocking as the image of the then-hugely pregnant actress seated behind the wheel of a luxury SUV screaming obscenities into a cell phone at her personal contract killer. Here was a star who really acted like one.In ""Chicago"" Rob Marshalls film version of the 1975 musical first staged by Bob Fosse Zeta-Jones plays a different kind of beautiful monster Velma Kelley a former habitue of the Chicago stage now appearing in prison. The time is 1929 a time of bootleggers and Tommy guns and Velma has as they used to say done her man wrong. (Her sister too whom she discovered en flagrante with the deceased.) As far as Velma and her lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) are concerned however jail is just another public relations opportunity. On stage the showgirl had to share the limelight with her sister but whether shes putting in face time with Billy at the courtroom or granting interviews from behind bars Velma now receives top billing. Shes a Chicago star like Al Capone.A star on the fade alas. Velma isnt really the main attraction in this iteration of the musical which centers far more on the trials of Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) a would-be chorine who shoots her lover (Dominic West) and begs her husband (John C. Reilly) to take the rap. He does and then he doesnt which is how Roxie lands on the same prison block with her vaudeville idol Velma. Aided by Matron Mama Morton (an underused Queen Latifah) Roxie follows Velmas lead hires Billy Flynn and with his assistance transforms into Chicagos newest tabloid sensation. As far as Roxie is concerned murderesses row isnt much different from tryouts in the sticks. If youre not killed you may hit the big time.Fosse based his 1975 musical on the Maurine Dallas Watkins play which in turn took its inspiration from cases shed covered as a journalist while working at the Chicago Tribune. (Frank Urson directed one film version in the 1920s and nearly two decades later Nunnally Johnson wrote another ""Roxie Hart."") Fosses ""Chicago"" which he created with John Kander and Fred Ebb is often marked for its darkly cynical attitude toward the media and celebrity a cynicism which holds true only for those who have never seen plays like ""The Front Page"" or films like ""A Face in the Crowd."" A quarter of a century later Fosses ostensible cynicism at least as interpreted by Marshall who also did the choreography for the film seems quaintly earnest. Denuded of satire the musical now comes across as another charming if creaky theatrical contrivance.For musical lovers this likely wont matter. There isnt much Fosse in evidence in this ""Chicago"" which means theres little raunch and next to no heat and Marshall has an exasperatingly impatient filmmaking style. Like Baz Luhrmann in the superior ""Moulin Rouge"" he simply refuses to sit still. Instead of letting his performers just do their own thing he chops up their bodies like some lunatic cubist then frantically tosses the pieces around. Theres a reason why when Fred Astaire started in movies he insisted that the cinematographer film his entire body; he wanted us to see what he was doing. None of Marshalls three leads is truly up to the demands of either the choreography or Kander and Ebbs sly vaudeville pastiche but its maddening that for most of their numbers youre not allowed to fully watch them try.Energetic and eager to please the three stars nonetheless appear to be having a good time with Gere in particular taking obvious pleasure in his role as a press corps puppeteer. His matinee looks stand up better to the films grubby cinematography as well which turns shadows into murky puddles and tends to be hard on Zellweger especially in close-up. It takes Zellweger some time to warm up although she finally does but its Zeta-Jones who keeps you watching from start to finish. Whether bouncing into a split during ""All That Jazz"" or vamping through ""I Simply Cannot Do It Alone"" she refuses to let you go. Youd have to go back to Joan Crawford in her hungry prime in films like ""Rain"" and ""The Women"" to find another female film star who grabs hold of the screen with such ferocity. If musicals are dreams she is their greatest dreamer.ChicagoMPAA rating PG-13 for sexual content and dialogue violence and thematic elements.Times guidelines Some (not enough) suggestive dancing and songs.

Based on a 1926 play it was twice adapted for the movies before Bob Fosse (with the songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Ebb) turned it into a musical in 1975. But it was not until the Broadway remount in 1996 in a stripped-down version that emphasized its music more than its story that Chicago became a huge hit. Miramax has been trying to make a film of it ever since. First-time director Rob Marshall and screenwriter Bill Condon ( Gods and Monsters) arent defeated in their efforts to bring kicking and singing to the screen but it is at best a disputable victory. The movie is appealing thanks to the cleverness of the Kander-Ebb songs and the enthusiasm of the performances but it lacks any urgency or erotic spark. In an effort to maintain the off-the-boards immediacy to the song-and-dance numbers while adding a ""realistic"" psychological framework to the story the filmmakers have done some revamping. The musical performances are intended to represent Roxies flights of fancy while shes in her jail cell awaiting trial for shooting her adulterous lover. Her fantasies are a bit stunted They all take place on a vaudeville stage introduced by an arch piano-playing master of ceremonies played by Taye Diggs. Apparently Baz Luhrmanns Moulin Rouge did not change the face of movie musicals after all. The stage revival included Ann Reinking as Roxie (who won one of the plays six Tony awards in 1997 for her choreography) and Bebe Neuwirth (who won another Tony as Velma). By contrast the movies Hollywood cast has been selected more for youthful box office appeal than musical theatre reputations. (It could have been worse; at one point the names Goldie Hawn and Madonna were reportedly attached to the project.) An unflaggingly energetic Renee Zellweger (channelling the plucky cartoon spirit of Betty Boop) plays Roxie who shot her deceiving boyfriend for dumping her. When her doting husband (John C. Reilly) proves too stupid to successfully take the rap for her she ends up facing a hanging. As Velma Catherine Zeta-Jones is suitably feline and haughty and the most authentically talented song-and-dance member of the cast. She plays a former member of a sister duo act who shot her husband and her sibling when she found them in an unorthodox rehearsal position. Their high-profile lawyer is Richard Gere who surprises mainly by possessing a credible vintage tenor voice. Rounding out the cast are rapper Queen Latifah (also a strong singer) playing the conniving prison warden who runs the jail on a system of personal favours and Christine Baranski ( Cybill) as a fawning reporter. In one scene the press corps appears with strings attached to their heads and shoulders marionettes in the hands of Billys slick manipulations. Marshall is listed as the choreographer and though the editing is too busy to really get a sense of the flow of movement it feels like a softer variation of Fosses sharp aggressive sexual style. You cant help wondering what Fosse would have done to add some panache and ferocity toa film version of Chicago a musical that was created in the mid-seventies after his movies Cabaret and Lenny and before the autobiographical All That Jazz. Compared with these works -- despite its murder corruption adultery and exploitation -- Chicago seems like a mildly naughty frolic.

"Chicago sings - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Chicago sings. . . but without Fosse it aint quite all that jazz""Chicago"" (star)(star)(star)December 27 2002|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic.Roxie Hart the dangerous dame played by Renee Zellweger in the movie ""Chicago"" is supposed to be a typical 1920s Chicago gal a killer with the face of a cherub. But shes also a girl who wants to sing dance and be a star--and the movie lets her fulfill that weird double fantasy. Based on the 1975 Broadway show directed choreographed and co-written by the late Bob Fosse its a cynical Cinderella musical about corrupt people with big appetites becoming famous in a corrupt city Prohibition-era Chicago--and its staged as if the big song and dance numbers were coming right out of Roxies feverish greedy little brain.Socking out her songs and story on stage cluing us in to all the dirt from the time she shoots her faithless lover to her sensational trial and its strange aftermath star-struck Roxie turns her sordid saga into a glitzy vaudeville act while a slithery emcee-bandleader (Taye Diggs) calls the shots a la ""Cabaret.""At her best Roxie almost knocks the audience dead--and so do her stage-mates fellow chanteuse-killer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and their amoral tap-dancing lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere).When the three stars do their dance numbers drowned in garish lights and glitz singing saucy songs that reveal their dark souls its hard not to smile. They may not be great musical performers but this is great musical material from the once-underrated now revered show by Fosse and his ""Cabaret"" partners John Kander and Fred Ebb. The original choreography has been refashioned by first-time movie director Rob Marshall but Fosse is present in spirit in the dance numbers. Charmingly sleazy and show-stopping these dances catch some of the insinuatingly sexy body-flaunting grab-your-hat style made famous by Fosse in movies like ""Cabaret"" and ""All that Jazz"" and shows like ""Chicago"" and ""Pippin."" Its a shame Fosse isnt around for this movie too.For that matter its a shame Chicago mostly isnt around; this is another runaway production shot primarily in Toronto. And though its true that the film is a period recreation it suffers from a lack of any real sense of the city any open air--or any views of Lake Michigan.""Chicago"" is very dark stuff and you may need a Fosse (or a Fosse acolyte like star-choreographer Ann Reinking in the hit 1996 Broadway revival) to truly bring it off. Based on William Wellmans 1942 crime-comedy movie ""Roxie Hart""--in which Ginger Rogers played doll-faced Roxie and Adolphe Menjou was the duplicitous Flynn--the story carries us back to the high-spirited violent gangland Chicago of ""The Front Page"" or ""Some Like It Hot."" Then a pretty woman with a smart mouthpiece could get away with murder--because Chicago juries would never sentence a dame to death.Though the 1942 ""Roxie Hart"" (one of iconoclast Stanley Kubricks favorite films) was based on an earlier play and movie the original inspiration was a real-life Chicago case; the current movie keeps that muckraking stance. We see Roxie schooled by Flynn and goaded by Velma (whos in the pen for killing her sister/stage partner) ventilate her lover (Dominic West) because he lied when he said he could make her a star. The murder does just that make Roxie a Chicago celebrity and toast of the scandal rags and of sob sisters like hard-shell radio reporter Mary Sunshine (Christine Baranski).When Roxie hires Flynn a silken shyster who never lost a case or kept a scruple she seems on her way to an acquittal and show biz success. Along the way she exploits and dumps her schmo husband Amos (John C. Reilly) hooks up with the prisons scheming matron Mama Morton (Queen Latifah) battles all her other prison rivals including Velma--and maybe gets her chance to shine on stage.Even a second-rate movie musical can occasionally charm your socks off and ""Chicago""--a flawed film version of a scintillating Broadway show--has enough bright moments (especially the ""Cell Block Tango"" and ""All That Jazz"" numbers) to make you feel deep nostalgia for the whole film musical form. Thats a form that seemed dead for years until Baz Luhrmann revived it with last years stunning ""Moulin Rouge."" Though ""Chicago"" is no ""Moulin Rouge""--and certainly not the ""Chicago"" you can imagine being made by Fosse--its fun splashy and entertainingly nasty.Zeta-Jones can belt out her numbers Zellweger can purr hers and Gere--a musician who played his own cornet solos in ""The Cotton Club""--can sell his songs and even dance a spiffy little tap dance. Theyre better than youd expect--and so is the movie. But though they hold the screen and act up a storm they cant give the film the kind of musical energy and style Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera reportedly gave Fosses version or Reinking and Bebe Neuwirth gave the revival. Only Queen Latifah has real musical self-confidence (in her big number ""When Youre Good to Mama"") and only Reilly truly carries his song by acting in his wistful rendition of ""Mr. Cellophane.""1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesPassing Of Bob Fosse Signals A Change In Musical TheaterSeptember 27 1987Not The Same `ChicagoDecember 3 1998`Chicago has a bit of razzle but small-time band fails to...March 29 2002Find More Stories AboutDanceBob FosseRoxie HartTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-12-27/entertainment/0212270359_1_prohibition-era-chicago-roxie-hart-1920s-chicago,200,chicago33,chicago,chicagotribune
"Chicago | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; chicago ) Chicago (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Once upon a time a Broadway musical like Chicago would have automatically received a silver screen treatment a but that was before the popularity of the movie musical crashed and burned. Nevertheless the enthusiasm surrounding the 1996 revival of Bob Fosses 1975 play was so extreme that studios were willing to absorb a certain amount of financial risk on the off-chance that this movie might be able to succeed where so many others had failed. The last major motion picture musical was 1996s Evita which performed tepidly (with a domestic gross of about 50 million against a budget of 55 million). Miramax Films is hoping for a better showing for Chicago. The movie represents good solid entertainment. Its not nearly as rousing as the Broadway revival (then again its rare that the cinematic version of a musical comes close to the stage incarnation) but for those unable or unwilling to see a live production it represents a sparkling replacement. The film strikes a nice balance between the lavishly overproduced likes of Baz Lurhmanns Moulin Rouge and the less openly flamboyant movies from the 50s. The style by intention echoes that of the late great choreographer Fosse. The history of Chicago is nothing if not convoluted. Originally a play by Chicago Tribune reporter Maurine Watkins Chicago chronicled the real-life 1924 murder trials of two women who were eventually acquitted of their alleged crimes. Watkins non-musical production reached Broadway in December 1926 and became the basis of two movies including the 1942 Ginger Rogers vehicle Roxie Hart. Decades later Bob Fosse obtained the rights to the story and working with John Kander amp; Fred Ebb he brought a musical version to the stage in 1975 with Gwen Verdon Chita Rivera and Jerry Orbach in the lead roles. Despite receiving lukewarm reviews the play stayed alive for nearly 900 performances before ending its run. When Chicago was revived in 1996 (initially as part of New Yorks City Center Encores Series) choreographer Ann Reinking devised the new version as an homage to her mentor Fosse albeit with a lighter less cynical tone. The movie adaptation which has been rumored for several years (and once had names like Madonna and Goldie Hawn attached) is heavily based on the 1996 edition rather than the 1975 one. Fame is fleeting because the public is fickle. And nothing titillates the public like the sensational. Looking back on the 1990s which news stories are the ones that come to mind most quickly? Tonya Harding clubbing Nancy Kerrigan? O.J. Simpsons murder trial? The Lewinsky scandal? Consider this and its not hard to understand why Chicago which is about the celebrity status often accorded to criminals and the short-lived nature of fame has found such favor during its revival. Things have changed a lot since the 70s. We were now ready to confront things that had been too raw in the immediate wake of Watergate. The films central characters are Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) a housewife who fantasizes becoming a vaudeville star and Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a chorus girl who dreams of greater fame than she currently has. Both women find themselves in the Cook County Jail on ""Muderers Row."" Roxie shot her lover after discovering that he had lied to her about working to further her singing career. Velma eliminated her husband and sister after finding them together in bed. Both women are being represented by slick lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) who has never lost a case. His approach is to set up his clients as media darlings then use that exposure to swing the trial in their favor. ""In this town murders a form of entertainment"" he comments. He refers to courtrooms as ""three ring circuses"" and assures Roxie that justice can be blinded by the ""razzle dazzle"" he will employ. Their notoriety sets up Roxie and Velma as rivals for the public spotlight. The lurid details of their lives and crimes make them instant celebrities. But neither stays on top for long and it becomes a difficult task to recapture the interest of the public once another sensational crime has been committed. Theres an insatiable appetite for fresh blood and unless Roxie and Velma can come up with new revelations to keep them on the front page they will be quickly forgotten a not only by the general populace but by their camera-loving lawyer as well. Several of the plays numbers have been cut for reasons of pacing and length but those that remain are expertly staged combining high energy Fosse-like choreography with a uniquely cinematic approach that allows vaudeville fantasy sequences to intertwine with more ""concrete"" moments. (For example the courtroom scenes of Roxies trial freely switch back and forth between testimony and Richard Geres rendition of ""Razzle Dazzle."") Credit for this goes to choreographer-turned-director Rob Marshall who is making his feature debut. The real show stopper remains as has always been the case with the play the opening interpretation of ""All That Jazz."" I have few complaints about the casting which was viewed as controversial when it was announced. Catherine Zeta-Jones devours the part of Velma with relish as if she was born to play the stuck-up murderess. Renee Zellweger while not Zeta-Jones equal when it comes to drawing the cameras attention is solid for the most part although there are a few occasions when her singing could have been stronger. Richard Gere freed from the need to be serious and intense exudes charm and charisma in a fun breezy role that requires him to sing but doesnt stretch his limited vocal abilities. John C. Reilly is a true sad-sack as Roxies cuckolded husband and Queen Latifa is ""Mama"" Morton the matron in charge of the female prisoners on Murderers Row who will help out her charges for a modest fee. Even though the movies original source material is 75 years old the issues addressed by this film will be familiar to everyone in the audience proving the point that technology may evolve but human nature remains the same. The social commentary and attacks on the American system of jurisprudence are as stinging as they are valid. The nine or ten song-and-dance numbers allow us to enjoy Chicago on a less cerebral more visceral level than might be the case if this was not a musical but theres still a fair amount of substance to be considered. Its a pleasure to note that the return of the movie-adapted stage musical is such an unqualified success.

THE drumbeat the thwack the punch line; the tickle and slap of a sight gag; the wink the nudge the shimmy and all that jazz. If theater has always done certain gestures without apology musical theater does them brazenly Characters still swing into song in the midst of otherwise quotidian chores; a ragtag crowd might combust into a gyrating entity. And in Chicago the stage production -- subtitled ""A Musical Vaudeville"" -- chorus girl Roxie Hart plugs Fred Casely her furniture-selling paramour while vaudeville star Velma Kelly purrs her way through the mood-setting tune ""All That Jazz."" ""Nobody walks out on me"" Roxie shouts. Bang. ""Sweetheart"" he groans. ""Dont sweetheart me you son of a bitch."" Bang again. Roxie then gilds this chilled act of passion with a memorable simper ""I gotta pee."" In Chicago the movie directed by Rob Marshall Roxie Hart is a softer creature. This is no cop-out. Murderers are typically rank narcissists blind to the emotional havoc of their deeds yet painfully sensitive to their own discomfort. Roxie is no different. Yet Renee Zellweger offers a portrait of blond ambition that sways persuasively between timidity and temerity. Roxies attempt to parlay infamy into fame murder into a show-biz career still begins with a bang but before she snuffs out the cads life she shares her -- well dreams would be too starry-eyed a word. Business plan is more like it. Everyone has a shtick. ""My thing could be aloof"" says Roxie yammering in a way that makes plain that ""aloof"" is a foreign land Roxies never set foot in. That Roxie is perp not victim here says something about the gals who inspired Chicago Tribune reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins to write the play Chicago originally called The Brave Little Woman which premiered in 1926. Two years earlier 20-year-old Beulah Annan married to a mechanic was accused of shooting her lover. At the same time Mrs. Belva Gaertner was being tried for killing her lover. They became jailhouse friends even posing together for a tabloid photo. Each was acquitted Beulah with the able assist of showman lawyer W.W. OBrien. Chicagos Roxie and Velma have a more competitive bond. (""I hate you"" Roxie tells Velma at one point. ""Theres only one business in the world where thats not a problem"" Velma reminds her.) Still many of the facts remain Roxies got a rube of a husband in Amos Hart (John C. Reilly) and a knight in Teflon armor in lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). The two women are in prison at the same time doing their diva turns in Cook County Jail (lorded over by Queen Latifahs amusingly corrupt warden and booking agent Matron Mama).

Aug. 15 705pm John Kander Fred Ebb and Bob Fosses musical adaptation of Watkins play opened on Broadway in 1975 and has been awaiting its close-up for more than 25 years. Since the mid-90s a fair amount has been written about the various names attached to this tortuous transformation among them Madonna who was once onboard to play the role of Velma Kelly which ultimately went to Catherine Zeta-Jones. But it was Marshall and screenwriter Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters) who figured out the elegant solution that gives the musical numbers their cinematic and emotional integrity. By making nearly every red-and-blue-bathed number Roxies projection the filmmakers have created a psychological musical. Moving fluidly between Roxies gallows-courting reality and her stagy hallucinatory daydreams the film cuts to the heart of some perennial cultural conundrums Why does the fans fond gaze become devouring? Why does ardor give way to envy? How is it that certain dreams become criminal and certain crimes become causes celebres? If these strike you as slightly tattered concerns its possibly because these days the national mood is more Cabaret (the truly great adaptation of the other Ebb Kander Fosse musical) than Chicago more imperial menace than fever dream of overidentification. Not to worry. Give it 15 minutes. Theres sure to be another trial of the century. In the meantime Chicago is that rare thing a nutritious hard candy. WHILE MARSHALL (WHOSE OTHER DIRECTING credits are televisions Cinderella and the Emmy-winning Annie) is generally cautious with camera movement he dazzles with the interplay between Roxies life troubles and her defensive fantasies. On this count Chicago delivers precision timing beyond the deft rhythms of the original. Arguably the most pointed of these comes when Roxie and Billy Flynn hold a press conference. The scene swings freely from courthouse photo-op to a song-and-dance number ""We Both Reached for the Gun"" in which Billy plays ventriloquist to Roxies dummy. Mouthpiece indeed Looking wooden and shellacked Roxie sits atop her slick lawyers lap as he feeds her lines to deliver to a greedy press. And because imaginative subtlety is not Roxies strong suit when Billys not animating her she envisions him literally jerking the reporters strings. The exuberance of the number is matched only by its arch and familiar message The media gets played. Why? Because it wants to. The most pliant of the reporters Mary Sunshine (Christine Baranski) hands Billy a glass of milk. He drinks up even as he hits his final robust note. Geres knowing smirk is right at home on Billy Flynns arrogant mug. Yet its his goofball glee -- and his better-than-good singing -- thats the most pleasing even as it reminds us that courtroom charmers like Flynn are in the biz the legal profession because of the pleasure in putting on a show. Zellweger yet again refines her gift for wavering between self-opacity and startled self-awareness. Despite her calculations Roxie is no Eve Harrington But then again Eve never murdered anyone. You get the sense that Zellwegers Roxie will always be a work in progress. As for Catherine Zeta-Jones Velma Kelly Sometime in the recent past in some darkened screening room the folks at Miramax might have thought as they watched the Guy Ritchie-Madonna remake of Swept Away ""There but for the grace of God."" Chicagos Velma must exude from the jump an utter confidence that Madonna hasnt shown onscreen since Desperately Seeking Susan. Zeta-Jones on the other hand is so naturally self-assured she can hawk T-Mobile 24/7 and never imagine shes slumming. Her Velma growls her songs -- and does a not-half-bad channeling of Cyd Charisse. And when finally Velma has to grovel Zeta-Jones offers an emotional photo neg to Zellwegers aggressive tentativeness a kind of pleading varnished by bravado. When it comes to Velma Roxie was always right She really does have a quality Roxie lacks. Is it any wonder in the end they take their act to the stage? These ""killer dillers"" these ""sinners"" they complete each other.

This review was changed on Dec. 12 2002. A stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help ""Chicago"" make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact. But despite these assets plus the enduring kick of the superlative Kander amp; Ebb song score this film version dilutes a good deal of the live shows sizzle and wit. First-time feature director Rob Marshall and Oscar-winning ""Gods and Monsters"" screenwriter Bill Condon have spun the dark tale of two murdering floozies into a widely palatable entertainment but the long-gestating film comes up short in rhythm and personality. Pic could score midrange business with older crowds drawn by the novelty of its all-singing all-dancing stars. Miramaxs awards-season push undoubtedly will be a major factor in the films commercial profile. Originally directed choreographed and co-authored in 1975 by Bob Fosse then stripped back into what amounted almost to a concert staging with a jazz orchestra onstage in its considerably more successful 1996 revival ""Chicago"" wasnt an easy target for film. Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein and producer Martin Richards struggled for six years to pull the pic together. The fundamental conundrum of how to sell a traditional musical to audiences unaccustomed to characters bursting into song was solved by Condons script which reimagines the numbers as the fruit of a stagestruck chorines rich fantasy life intercutting them with the parallel reality the songs narrate. However while it effectively underlines points about the fleeting nature of fame the indistinct line between celebrity and notoriety and the similarities between showbiz razzle-dazzle and a corrupt legal system the film version boasts few significant innovations. Much of the dialogue and jokes are word for word from the stage show and conception of musical numbers strays very little. Pic also refers to numerous movie musicals including a ""Cabaret""-style nightclub opening. Viewed in terms of its attempt to resurrect the musical as a contemporary film genre ""Chicago"" is way ahead of lifeless blunders like ""A Chorus Line."" But its arguably less buoyant or inventive than recent unconventional and artistically controversial tuners such as ""Moulin Rouge"" or ""Dancer in the Dark."" Set in the Windy City in the Roaring 20s the jazz-age story opens on sultry vaudevillian Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones) taking the stage solo in whats previously been a sister act after surprising her husband with the offending sibling and rubbing out the adulterous duo. In the audience to witness her arrest is unworldly Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) a chorus girl with dreams of stardom married to gullible dolt Amos (John C. Reilly). A few weeks later Roxie wises up that her lover (Dominic West) has been stringing her along with promises to get her into showbiz. She guns him down in a fit of rage and winds up joining Velma on death row. Making use of shrewdly connected prison warden Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah) Velma has lined up ace lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) who keeps her media spotlight burning as he prepares for her trial. Roxie too secures Flynns services when Amos stumps up a hefty cash advance. The lawyer concocts an elaborate convent-girl-led-astray story for Roxie making her the darling of the media and relegat-ing Velma to the back pages. When a new murderess threatens to steal her thunder Roxie consolidates her press profile by announcing shes carrying Amos child. The central relationship between Roxie and Velma carries less weight than the interaction between Roxie and Flynn. This undermines the effectiveness of the final act already a weakness in the stage version.Best known for the 1999 TV remake of ""Annie"" Marshall has a solid back-ground in musical theater that well serves the musical segs which shift confidently between fantasy and reality. The device works nicely in numbers like Amos acknowledgment of his own insignificance ""Mr. Cellophane""; the death-row dames account of their misdeeds ""Cell Block Tango""; and in smartly staged nonmusical setpieces like the historic first hanging of a woman. But too often the cross-cutting interrupts the rhythm of the songs to clutter the action instilling a certain frustration at never seeing a song or dance number played out in full.Editor Martin Walsh cuts the film like a trailer giving a semblance of briskness but skimping on the characters dimensionality. The fast cutting also dulls some of the shine from the two leads dance accomplishments. Zeta-Jones reveals herself to be a full-voiced belter and a more-than-creditable hoofer making Velma a savvy conniving but sympathetic temptress untroubled by moral scruples. Zellweger also measures up well enough in the song-and-dance department but convinces more in Roxies initial persona as a borderline innocent than later as she becomes more calculating and cold-hearted. As the character whose dreams bring much of the action to life she remains a somewhat pallid figure. Gere has fun embodying a soulless charmer in circus-master Flynn but his lackluster courtroom-climax tap routine makes one long for a real dancer in the role. Making the Matron a sharp exploiter with her eye firmly on the dollar but not completely without loyalty Latifah socks across the saucy ""When Youre Good to Mama."" But the characters rueful ballad ""Class"" -- arguably one of the shows best songs -- has been dropped from the film despite being clearly set up. Reilly is sweetly touching as the trusting sap while Christine Baranski is arch and amusing as bleeding-heart radio reporter Mary Sunshine. Lucy Liu appears briefly as a socialite hellcat and Chita Rivera who played Velma in the original Fosse produc-tion alongside Gwen Verdon cameos as a prison habitue. Marshalls choreography retains some distinctive Fosse influences particularly in the opening ""All That Jazz"" number -- nevertheless hampered more than any other song by excessive cutting away from the dancers.Australian lenser Dion Beebe (""Praise"" ""Holy Smoke"") doesnt always shoot the dance segs to best advantage but places the action on a rich canvas of dark tones and bloody reds combining with John Myhres sharp production design and Colleen Atwoods slinky costumes to create a seamless look that blends theatricality with reality. A new song written by Kander amp; Ebb and sung by Zellweger and Zeta-Jones called ""I Move On"" is being added to the end credits but was not in place on prints being press-screened.
