Adam Sandler in Jack and Jill (Tracy Bennett) D+ Jack and Jill Genre Comedy; Starring Katie Holmes Adam Sandler Al Pacino; Director Dennis Dugan; Author Steve Koren Robert Smigel; Release Date Wide 11/11/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 86; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted November 18 2011 -- 1200 AM EST The other day I passed a subway poster for Adam Sandlers new comedy Jack and Jill with ""NOT FUNNY"" scrawled across Sandlers forehead. If the citizen-critic was referring to the saturation-carpet-bomb movie trailer that has been scarring our eyeballs for the past few weeks then like right on That thing is painful. But if the comment was just generally lobbed in the direction of Sandlers head then a clarification is in order. Adam Sandler is obviously funny to his audience his base his peeps who know what to expect from an Adam Sandler comedy. Am I right? Anybody? Some of his movies are mushy and others more sour. Some are more blithely gross others tilted more towards anger. Often theyre built around a core of male childishness and usually they end up cuddled in a soft heap of family values. But in one form or another you get exactly what you pay for at an Adam Sandler comedy. Otherwise the man wouldnt have earned zillions. Anyhow Jack and Jill is not not funny. Its just unreliably haphazardly funny when its not just obnoxiously sentimental or plain obnoxious. And for anyone less than a Sandler loyalist -- for someone like me -- that sloppy hodgepodge approach is exhausting. Maybe youre different? The joke is that Sandler plays fortysomething Jack Sadelstein a successful Los Angeles ad executive husband and father of two and he also plays Jill Sadelstein Jacks braying neurotic unmarried fraternal-twin sister from hometown Bronx N.Y. Jack is proudly Jewish The family celebrates Hanukkah (as well they should since Sandler pretty much put that minor winter holiday on the map with his Hanukkah song). But most of Jacks jagged Jewish edges have been well smoothed by economic success and geographical distance from his Bronx childhood. His wife (poor bereft Katie Holmes given absolutely nothing of consequence or interest to do) is a classy-looking convert to Judaism and their young son is adopted from India. (Their little biological daughter dresses in a Pilgrim costume for Thanksgiving.) Jill on the other hand with her yawping New York borough accent her abrasive coarseness of manner her overdone inappropriate wardrobe and makeup and her shtetl mentality (""Whats the Internet?"" she screeches) is the uncouth unrenovated Jewish sibling. She says the wrong thing shes needy shes insensitive to social cues shes zaftig and uncoordinated and self-pitying and sweaty and quick to take offense. Jill drives Jack crazy with antics that take up most of the movie until Jack realizes in the end that his sister is really a good-hearted horror and that he Jack loves Jill and that its worth putting up with her thin-skinned craziness once a year because thats what family is about. (Once a year at holiday time at least because thats what counts as family time these days.) Yeah yeah yeah happy Festivus and all that. But meanwhile in another corner of the movie Sandler and his frequent slaphappy director Dennis Dugan sign off on fascinating craziness of an entirely different kind this time from no less a big-deal thespian than Al Pacino. The grand star plays ""Al Pacino"" -- to be sure a cockeyed version -- and when we first meet him this Al is on stage in a production of Shakespeares Richard III mad as hell because the ringing of some idiots mobile phone in the audience has distracted him. Pacino is not generally a ""funny"" actor but playing this version of himself -- an eccentric star who develops an obsessive crush on Jill because he responds to her realness her rawness her glass-shattering Bronx inflections -- hes a weird figure of nutty fun. You dont know Al until youve seen him wooing an Adam Sandler whos dolled up in shticky drag. But you do know Sandler. So make your ticket selection accordingly.

Sandler plays both title characters Jack a struggling adman and Jill the vulgar oafish twin sister who becomes his unwanted houseguest. Admittedly the film is merely a series of random celebrity cameos and shameless product placements (in one case both - thank you the guy from the Subway advert). But there are a few moments of inspired absurdity mostly provided by a surprisingly energetic Al Pacino playing himself and channeling the smitten millionaire Joe E Brown from Some Like It Hot as he falls head over heels for Jill.

Share Tweet As the good parts grow slimmer and the docking fees grow larger all Great Actors have the inevitable late-career embarrassment when the gravitas that dignified their classic performances only serves to deepen their humiliation. Think Orson Welles in The Transformers The Movie Marlon Brando in The Island Of Doctor Moreau or Robert De Niro in well much of the last two decades. Playing himself in Jack And Jill a deadly comedy starring Adam Sandler as identical twins of different genders Al Pacino spends most of his time trying to seduce Sandlers female character the mannish Jill and the film is an inventory of new lows. Pacino tickles Jills hairy armpits. He flails around to The Monkees. He busts a few rhymes in a choreographed rap number. And he does it all with a self-deprecating zeal thats simultaneously sad and winning. Still Pacino is by far the best thing about Jack And Jill because at least hes making an effort. When he isnt around there are whole scenes in which Sandler as both cynical advertising wizard Jack and abrasive-but-well-meaning Jill sits around the house with his movie family seemingly waiting around for somebody to feed him a line. (That line usually arrives in the form of a fart.) The thin plot brings the estranged siblings together over the holidays which are extended from Thanksgiving to New Years because the lonely Jill needs some company. Jacks hostility toward his sister softens a little when he hatches a plan to use her womanly charms to lure Pacino into doing a Dunkin Donuts commercial. Jack And Jill operates like most other Adam Sandler comedies He plays an angry mush-mouthed manchild his saintly better half (Katie Holmes) clucks at him like Marge Simpson Sandlers buddies make cameo appearances product placements cover the bulk of the 80 million production budget and the third act is awash in unearned sentiment. What makes Jack And Jill worse than the average Sandler vehicle is Jill whos been conceived as little more than a dude in drag hold the jokes. Given the chance Pacino could have taken a role like that to wild--though perhaps transcendently awful--new places. Because he cant be bothered Sandler strands himself in the middle of a 90-minute Saturday Night Live sketch.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 11 2011 Save for later Saved Adam Sandler plays a dual role as Jill (l.) and Jack in a scene from Jack and Jill. Tracy Bennett/Sony - Columbia Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Adam Sandler plays a dual role in ""Jack and Jill"" and hes a lot better as Jill than as Jack. The plot is a flimsy excuse for a lot of goofy drag humor. Jack is a successful L.A. ad executive and Jill is his obnoxious twin sister who has come for her annual dreaded Thanksgiving visit. For reasons too ridiculous to get into she ends up being wooed by a seriously smitten Al Pacino.Sandler has become a good actor of late but here he gives over most of his talents to Jill who is so screechy needy and lovelorn that you can hardly blame Jack for wanting to fade into the background. Pacino caricaturing his patented intensity is pretty outsized as well. This is the first time he has played a character this harmlessly goofy and it makes you wonder if hes trying to compete with Robert De Niro who long ago decided to lampoon his intensity in films like the ""Analyze This"" and ""Fockers"" series. Pacinos grandstanding is funny for a while until you realize that given the calculated tepidness of most mainstream movies Pacino may not have many opportunities these days to be great. Grade C+ (Rated PG for crude and sexual humor language comic violence and brief smoking.)

"Jack and Jill review A sister act -- sort of |       NJ.com comments Jack and Jill review A sister act -- sort of Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 11 2011 at 747 AM View/Post Comments Columbia PicturesJill and Jack (both Adam Sandler) in Columbia Pictures ""Jack amp; Jill."" It is an absolutely safe bet that a lot of movie critics are going to be talking today about what a horrible Adam Sandler movie ""Jack and Jill"" is. And Im not here to disagree with them. I just want to point out there is a bizarrely wonderful and surreal Al Pacino comedy buried inside it. The Sandler comedy can be disposed of quickly. The comic plays a Los Angeles ad man who has a sister who still lives in the Bronx. She comes to visit for Thanksgiving and drives him crazy. And Sandler plays both parts. Its basically one of those fake bad movies in Sandlers ""Funny People."" You know the films his character was supposed to be ashamed of ever making? Except apparently the real Sandler isnt. The only close-to-saving grace is that Sandler the ad man needs to get Al Pacino to do a TV commercial -- and for some strange reason Pacino is entranced by Sandlers sister. Which becomes an excuse for Pacino to do a fiercely funny pretty detailed burlesque of himself -- from referencing lines from ""The Godfather"" saga to doing that thing where hes SUDDENLY SHOUTING his dialogue for no reason at ALL. It works beautifully because -- like the best parodies -- it springs from affection and deep knowledge. The actors actual hometown neighborhoods his special love for ""Richard III"" his Method training -- all are carefully noted and then pushed a little too far. Also amusing are the films opening and ending credit sequences which collect a wide variety of real-life twins to talk about their relationship and to tease each other the way only siblings can. Unfortunately in between those scenes -- and apart from Pacinos lip-smacking performance -- youre still left with an Adam Sandler movie with all that entails. So gross humor and ethnic stereotypes? (Diarrhea scene funny Mexicans - yeah got `em). Old ""Saturday Night Live"" friends who have trouble getting other gigs? (Dana Carvey? David Spade? Come on down) A hack director who knows how to turn on the camera and applaud after every take? (Dennis Dugan were calling your name) Its all pretty unfunny and leaves you too much time to wonder about other things. Like how did this sludge ever get a PG rating? But try to ignore all that and just wait for Pacino to show up again. Hard as he tries he cant save the movie - thatd take a defibrillator. But he can make you feel like not quite such a sucker for buying a ticket. Ratings note The film contains far too much crude humor for a PG movie. Jack and Jill (PG) Columbia (91 min.) Directed by Dennis Dugan. With Adam Sandler Al Pacino. Now playing in New Jersey.

Jennie Punter The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 11 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English A marathon of Tyler Perrys Madea flicks is preferable to Jack and Jill a noxious PG comedy starring Adam Sandler as a pair of middle-aged male-female twins that should have been separated at birth to spare us from this movie. Men in drag are a tried-and-true staple of film comedy. Its generally funniest when a male actor plays a man disguising himself as a woman for an important plot purpose a la Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in Some Like it Hot Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie and Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire. Movies Jack and Jill The official trailer In those movies the laughs come from the transformation pains (hair removal undergarment fittings) slip-ups and the characters reaction to living in a womans world (thwarting male advances etc.). This scenario actually does happen towards the end of Jack and Jill but its cruel and creepy not funny. Sandler plays a woman - Jill an athletic chatterbox spinster who lives in the Bronx - and also acts opposite himself as Jack a successful L.A. ad exec with a wife (Katie Holmes) and two kids. Even with modern advances in makeup and special effects both are tricky feats for any actor and Sandler - who has a hard time wiping that hint of a smirk off his face in most of his screen roles - falls short of meeting the challenge. Aside from the painful experience of watching Sandler in a bad wig and loud womans clothing and using a voice that is disturbingly reminiscent of Roger Rabbit Jack and Jill has an unfathomably bizarre story. And it revolves around a performance by Al Pacino in one of the strangest ""actor playing himself"" roles in Hollywood history. After Jill lands at Jacks family home for her annual Thanksgiving visit (with her entire wardrobe and pet cockatoo Poopsie) her twin brother can barely keep his loathing in check. He may be mean but hes just saying what were thinking. She manages to guilt Jack into allowing her to stay through to Christmas but he decides Jill needs a man in her life. After internet match-making fails Jack takes Jill to a Lakers game where Al Pacino (currently tearing up the scenery in a local production of Richard III) takes more than a shining to this large buxom gal from the Bronx. Shes the key inexplicably for Pacino to find a lost part of his soul he needs in order to accept the role of Don Quixote in a Broadway production of the musical Man of la Mancha. This is potentially a lucky break for Jack whos been working up the nerve to approach Pacino to participate in an ad campaign for Dunkin Donuts. But Jill whom Pacino takes back to his place is weirded out by the actors aggressive needy behaviour and wants nothing more to do with him. Can you see it coming? Yes indeed Jack eventually comes to the point where he must disguise himself as his sister to get Pacino on board. Unlike the aforementioned ""man in drag"" movies there is little situational humour in Jack and Jill. Instead Sandler co-writer Steve Koren and favoured Sandler director Dennis Duggan go for the gags with the homeless old people and ethnic minorities the butt of some jokes. The most entertaining part of Jack and Jill is actually the little documentary that rolls during the end credits where various pairs of real-life identical and fraternal twins banter about their relationships.

Photo (c)Columbia Pictures Adam Sandler (left and right). ""Burn this. All copies must be destroyed. No good. Al Pacino is reacting after watching his cringe-worthy song-and-dance number at the end of ""Jack and Jill but this harsh assessment could easily be applied to the entirety of this gruesomely unfunny Adam Sandler vehicle. The spectacle of Pacino mocking himself ""The Godfather and ""Scarface in the nadir of his career tends to overshadow this fiascos very poorly executed central gimmick Sandler in a dual role as male and female twins. He gives his typically bored lazy performance as Jack a successful and obnoxious director of TV commercials who lives in Los Angeles with his wife (Katie Holmes who looks embarrassed throughout) and children. PHOTOS ADAM SANDLERS LEADING LADIES Sandler is even harder to take -- and not remotely convincing as a woman even in a comic context -- as Jacks twin sister Jill a loud stupid and shrill caricature of a Jewish spinster who comes to visit from The Bronx for Thanksgiving. Jill wreaks havoc -- the two or three moments that vaguely approach being amusing can be seen in the TV commercial thats been playing in heavy rotation for weeks -- and announces shes staying through Hanukkah much to her brothers distress. At a Lakers game though Jill catches the eye of the instantly smitten Pacino whom Jack desperately needs to sign up for a Dunkin Donuts commercial. Their first date -- Al serenades Jill with ""The Impossible Dream while plying her with pastries at his home -- ends in tears possibly because she prefers Barry Manilows singing to Als croaking. But Jack needs Als services in the worst way. So he cross-dresses (even less convincingly) and substitutes for his sister for a romantic rendezvous with Al on an ocean liner. Only Al shows up with a helicopter and whisks ""her away to a castle in Europe. Where nothing really happens. Thats because ""Jack and Jill is being cynically marketed as a PG-rated ""family comedy. Personally Id be tempted to call child protective services on any parents who dragged their kids to a movie about a guy who is trying to pimp his sister or an unreasonable facsimile to Al Pacino. Making ""Little Fockers look like ""The Sound of Music there are also more flatulence jokes than Ive ever seen in a single movie beginning in the opening credits and reaching the lowest of many low points when Jill eats Mexican food for the first time. ""Is Evel Knievel popping wheelies in there? Jack asks as his sister loudly drops ""chimichanga bombs."" Those are the jokes folks. Besides Mexicans there are cruel gags targeted at South Asians (Sandler has an eccentric adopted son from India) and of course Jews (""What is Skype? It sounds anti-Semitic"") as well as references to hookers and men ""using"" women. Your 12 will also buy you prominent plugs for American Airlines Macys Marshalls Pepto-Bismol Mortons Steakhouse Desenex foot powder and Subway (the latter apparently paid extra for an appearance by its mascot Jared Fogle). This being an Adam Sandler movie theres the usual motley assortment of celebrity cameos -- Johnny Depp Regis Philbin John McEnroe Shaquille ONeal Christie Brinkley and Drew Carey. And the inevitable assortment of Sandlers pals Allen Covert Nick Swardson Tim Meadows Dana Carvey and (far more convincing as a woman than Sandler) David Spade. Directed by another longtime cohort Dennis Dugan (""Grown Ups) with all the skill of a blind parking lot attendant the latest in a string of shapeless overproduced Sandler messes is even worse than the appalling ""Just Go With It"" (which humiliated another Oscar winner Nicole Kidman) earlier this year. Apparently Sandlers enablers at Sony will continue to greenlight pretty much anything he wants to do as long as his movies make money. Its pretty sad if youre a comic and Al Pacino is the funniest thing in your movie. Pacino will probably seem most funny to people who havent seen most of his recent films where hes been bordering on self-parody for nearly a decade. I have a theory that ghastly movies such as ""Jack and Jill"" almost invariably comment on their own awfulness. Besides Pacinos remark about destroying all copies (an excellent idea) theres a reference to something ""that makes me want to choke on my own vomit."" Just like this movie.

No matter how bad the trailer makes it look; no matter how imbecilic the premise is; no matter how terrible the previous films made by the same people have been; you always allow for the possibility that the movie will be good. In fact you do more than that you HOPE it will be good. If you find yourself going into theaters WANTING to hate the movies you should probably stop going into theaters. I mention this up front so you will know that even though Jack and Jill -- in which Adam Sandler plays both a regular guy and that guys annoying twin sister -- has a trailer that makes it look awful and has an unworkable premise and was made by people who have made an abundance of stupid movies in the past I went into it hoping for the best. I didnt pre-judge it based on how miserable it seemed like it was probably going to be. And now having seen the film I can tell you that it is indeed every bit as lousy as it looks. So kudos to the marketing department I guess. They nailed this one. Sandler plays Jack Sadelstein a TV commercial director with a wife who for some reason is Katie Holmes a son who for some reason is Indian and a daughter who doesnt do anything of note. Jack grew up in the Bronx where his twin sister still lives and evidently kept developing her Bronx accent after Jack moved to California. Everyone hates Jill because shes loud crass clueless obnoxious needy unreasonable unhygienic and ugly. Her poor social skills are probably the consequence of her dreadful physical appearance -- she looks like Adam Sandler in drag after all and Adam Sandler aint exactly a Gossip Girl extra to begin with. Whatever the reason shes dreadful and she should die the end. Anyway Jill comes to visit for Thanksgiving and stays indefinitely during which time Jack tries to find her a boyfriend through some online dating sites. She goes on a date with Norm Macdonald who is astonished by her physical appearance even though her picture was included in her profile. (The people who made the movie dont care. Ugly girls are funny) She also goes for a pony ride and breaks the ponys legs. Shes so ""fat"" she literally collapses a pony. Shes pony-collapsingly fat. Of course shes actually not fat at all and doesnt weigh any more than her brother but hey ugly girls are supposed to be fat so there. Meanwhile Jack is going to lose the Dunkin Donuts account unless he can get Al Pacino to appear in the commercial. Theres no way Pacino would do it though because a TV commercial would be beneath him. The movie gets a lot of mileage out of this premise never realizing that it is negated by Pacinos appearance in this very movie. Jack stalks Pacino at a Lakers game Pacino meets Jill and is smitten with her maybe Jack can use his sister to get Pacino to do the commercial Jill rebuffs Pacino and Jack has to put on a dress and a wig and pretend to be her yada yada the rest writes itself David Spade has a cameo everybody goes home and weeps. The director is named Dennis Dugan. This is the seventh Sandler movie he has directed so hes gotten pretty good at letting everybody do whatever they want and not caring whether its funny. Hes gotten pretty good at showing up on the set turning on the cameras then taking a nap on the floor is what I mean. The screenplay is credited to Steve Koren (Click A Night at the Roxbury) and Sandler from a ""story"" by Ben Zook. In Hollywood parlance that probably means Zook wrote the original screenplay then Sandler bought it and Sandlered it up i.e. added broad physical comedy and bit parts for his friends. As in most of Sandlers lazier films characters behave without motivation and make changes in their lives only because theyve arrived at the point in the movie where characters are supposed to make changes in their lives. (Should you be unfortunate enough to see this film I defy you to tell me why Jack changes his mind about Jill at the end.) I dont know what Pacino is doing here but hes having fun with it. The guys insane. Does he know how bad the movie is? He must. But he fully commits to every stupid thing hes required to do which goes a long way toward making some of those stupid things bearable. His Dunkin Donuts commercial (spoiler alert he winds up doing it) is genuinely funny as a parody of awful embarrassing ads. The sad part is that the rest of the movie is every bit as bad as that intentionally bad commercial.

"Adam Sandlers Jack and Jill is a drag Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Adam Sandlers Jack and Jill is a dragAdam Sandler cross-dresses to play angry twins in this regressive comedy.November 11 2011|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Adam Sandler plays both title characters in ""Jack and Jill."" (Columbia Pictures )Maybe its middle age. Maybe its the pressure of success. Maybe its the nagging crisis of how to make flatulence jokes fresh again. (Wear a dress) But this seasons Adam Sandler comedy ""Jack and Jill"" a the last one ""Just Go With It"" was at the top of 2011 a feels like an elementary school recess thats gone on too long the merrymaking strained and the participants looking tired even when theyre in full comic dudgeon. Sandler in drag is the marquee gimmick this time playing whiny smothering and easily humiliated Bronx spinster Jill whos come to her successful commercial-director brother Jacks well-appointed Los Angeles mansion for a Thanksgiving visit that turns into an extended stay. Jacks various reactions to the prospect of more ""twin time"" with sis a despair anger meanness a are some of the more understandable emotions in this dispiriting exercise. Its tempting to view Sandlers double duty here as annoyer and annoyed as a grand comic riff on his lifes work as seen by his critics. But that would charitably suggest a measure of humorous forethought typically absent from the A-listers point-and-laugh approach to mockery and monastic belief that his raspy screaming a now in two flavors high-pitched and higher-pitched a is inherently funny. Men dressing up as women is rarely high comedy unless sexual politics are being addressed outright as in ""Some Like It Hot"" or ""Tootsie."" Sandlers Jill is straight out of his vaudevillian approach to female caricature however a was Rob Schneider too busy? a and it says something that the only other substantial female character is the requisite pretty-and-nonthreatening wife played with sitcom-spouse efficiency by Katie Holmes. When it comes to women in Sandlers world he only sees extremes hot or not worthy of putting on a pedestal or getting hit with one. In the wake of ""Bridesmaids"" Sandlers lipsticked tomfoolery a and inability to share the screen with genuinely funny women a feels particularly regressive and stale. Both movies have diarrhea gags but only one feels defined by such humor. The boys club ethos extends to the celebrity cameos too. Of the dozen or so on tap a which include Shaquille ONeal Johnny Depp Regis Philbin John McEnroe and Jared from the Subway ads a only one is female and Christie Brinkley doesnt even get her own laugh line. Then again what the famous-faces parade more often suggests than gender inequality is a road trip time-killer meant to keep bored passengers from falling asleep. Same goes for the product placement which includes a lovingly filmed Royal Caribbean cruises interlude that indicates director Dennis Dugan is the real commercial guy in this production. What to make of Al Pacino then who plays ""Al Pacino"" flamboyantly theatrical more than a little batty and hot for Jill? Theres a slight whiff of dinner-for-schmucks game-playing to his participation here but Pacino has been a drag version of Pacino for so long now he somehow fits into Sandlers piA+-ata party approach like a glove. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESGrown Ups 2 How did Adam Sandler buck his recent trend?July 15 2013Thats My Boy is an ominous sign for Adam SandlerJune 19 2012Movie review A Thousand WordsMarch 9 2012Movie review Just Go With ItFebruary 11 2011Movie review Grown UpsJune 25 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentAdam SandlerDennis DuganCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-jack-and-jill-20111111,0,4651961.story?track=rss",200,jackandjill11,jackandjill,latimes

It made me feel as if comedy itself were a dirty thing mainly practiced by people eager to express ugly feelings toward everyone from homely women to Mexican immigrants. I cant definitively say that this is the worst Adam Sandler movie ever made having missed last summers Grown Ups but it is certainly the worst I have ever seen. And I have always had a soft spot for Sandler. Jack Sadelstein (Sandler) is a successful director of commercials who lives in Los Angeles with his wife Erin (Katie Holmes about whom can be said only that she is pretty and looks good in her cute outfits) and their two children cheerful little poppets who jump up and down on cue and behave nothing like real kids. The movie begins with the Thanksgiving arrival of Jacks dreaded twin sister Jill (Sandler in drag) a spinster who speaks with a honking lisping painfully exaggerated faux Bronx accent. She extends her visit to stay long past Hanukkah. The Sadelsteins are Jewish a point that Jack hammers home again and again with his oft-voiced paranoia about anti-Semitism directed mostly at his hapless assistant (Nick Swardson). I found it jarring like a punch line without a joke. Jill is offensive. Her comments to her small nephew adopted from India are tasteless enough to get a producer fired from the Oscars. Shes also overbearing oblivious to social cues and (shudder) has unresolved incestuous feelings for her brother which began in infancy when she would spoon Jack in their crib and rest her little hand on his rump. As an adult she longs to do the same creeping up behind him as he naps. ""Why cant you lay with me?"" Jill whines indignantly when Jack recoils from her. (MORE See the Top 10 Cross-Dressing Movie Performances) Part of the films plot revolves around Jacks attempts to find his lonely sister a non-family member to love/spoon first on legitimate dating websites then via Craigslist. When all that fails he tries to hook her up with Al Pacino. (Well get back to Pacino later. Did I mention Im dead inside?) All this matchmaking is hardly necessary because Jacks nice Mexican gardener Felipe (Eugenio Derbez) practically salivates over this beast. Felipe invites Jill to join him for a regular Mexican family pastime - picnicking in the park playing soccer eating chimichangas and ""stealing white peoples wallets."" This squirm-worthy moment is topped only by Jills post-picnic run for the bathroom as the chimichangas make ""a run for the border."" I forgive Jack for hating his sister because I hate his sister. But the movie like so many insists on making a sentimental case for sibling bonding; the two eventually offer forced declarations of love. That climactic moment is conducted entirely in the twins secret language a kind of pig Latin. Perhaps Sandler couldnt stomach it in English. Personally I cant stomach a life lesson from a movie this vulgar. Do you still think you might want to see Jack and Jill? Well the film contains approximately one minute that is not excruciating. Its the one in which Johnny Depp appears during a Lakers game. He is droll and amusing. But there are any number of YouTube clips -- free clips -- in which he exudes that Depp charm. Why is he in this film? Is it some sort of cross dressing solidarity (see Ed Wood and Before Night Falls)?  This is the actor who compared being in photo shoots to being raped. Granted he later apologized for it but theres an irony there. In its presumption that audiences will eat up any inside Hollywood moment -- celebrities courtside just like in the tabloids but talking -- the Lakers scene is representative of how lazy this movie is. It is also ugly shot with all the visual grace of the cheapest sitcom. Except for the cruise ship scenes which are shot with all the grace of a Royal Caribbean ad campaign. And fancy that the Sadelsteins actually take a Royal Caribbean cruise. But of all the films product placements thats not even the most egregious. That honor goes to Dunkin Donuts. Which brings us back to Pacino. Dunkin Donuts wants Pacino to star in one of their ads and if Jack cant make this happen hell lose the lucrative client. Fortunately Pacino encounters Jill at the Lakers game and is set aflame with passion for her. In these grotesque scenes Pacino is pitiably game. If the surprisingly reticent Jill will let Pacino fondle her then maybe the star of the Godfather movies will sell out to the doughnut slinger. Al Pacino in a Dunkin Donuts ad. Can you imagine anything worse? I can. (MORE Sandler Seriously Rap Beats?)

When it was first announced Adam Sandlers gender-bending twin comedy ""Jack and Jill"" seemed something like an advanced act of Internet trolling and the actual film certainly lives down to expectations. Yet the pics general stupidity careless direction and reliance on a single-joke premise that was never really funny to begin with are only the most obvious of its problems. The previous two pics produced this year by Sandlers Happy Madison shingle ""Just Go With It"" and ""Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star"" grossed 103 million and 2.5 million respectively; ""Jack and Jill"" should fall somewhere between the two. Sandler (who plays both of the titular twin siblings here as well as co-scripting and producing) has made a number of genuinely funny lowbrow comedies yet even his better ones tend to be marred by recurring issues casual racism and classism lax filmmaking standards intrusive product placement and pointless celebrity cameos. ""Jack and Jill"" pushes these attributes to heretofore unseen levels and seems to complete the strange souring of Sandlers default posture from go-for-broke buffoonery to weary curdled misanthropy. Advertising exec Jack (Sandler) lives as do many latter-day Sandler protags in a palatial estate with a much younger wife (Katie Holmes adopting the tone of a dimwitted kindergarten teacher) and a pair of adorable children (Elodie Tougne Rohan Chand). Jacks present troubles are twofold His agency stands to lose a major client if he cant persuade Al Pacino to sign on as a Dunkin Donuts spokesman and his loudmouthed clingy twin sister Jill (also Sandler) is scheduled to fly in (on American Airlines were reminded) for Thanksgiving. A lonely spinster still living in the siblings Bronx home Jill has never heard of the Internet sweats and farts profusely and has a pet bird named Poopsie. After ruining Thanksgiving dinner through overwhelming obnoxiousness Jill announces her intention to stay on as a houseguest through Hanukkah and Jack begins to fret that her continued presence could pose a threat to his upcoming New Years Eve cruise (on Royal Caribbeans new Allure of the Seas vessel were reminded). Jack eventually decides the best way to rid himself of his twin is to set her up with a man though how he expects to entice her back to New York by finding her an L.A.-based boyfriend is puzzling indeed. In the early going the pacing is so haphazard the gag setups so cursory that a number of scenes play like surrealist video-art installations with no obvious connection to one another Jill rides a jet ski in Jacks pool with no explanation; then Jacks son Scotch-tapes small animals to his naked torso; then we get a non-sequitur sequence of Jill getting knocked unconscious on the set of ""The Price Is Right"" footage of which is then repeated five minutes later. In any case a shot at redemption for both twins arrives when the two attend a Lakers game where Pacino spots Jill from across the court and develops an immediate attraction. Indeed Pacino gets more screentime than any actor save Sandler. The notion of the celebrated thespian quoting Stella Adler in an attempt to seduce a drag-clad Sandler certainly seems funny in theory but by the time he performs a rap number incorporating his lines from ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" all admiration for his gameness has twisted into queasiness. Distressing though his role may be Pacino at least expends a good deal of effort in performing it which is more than can be said for Sandler. Male actors portraying female characters has been fertile ground for comedy since Aristophanes but Sandler makes no attempt to actually play a woman; he simply dons the wig and dress pitches his voice up an octave and does the same old schtick. There are sporadic laughs to be had. An uncredited Johnny Depp elicits the biggest with his choice of T-shirt in his one scene and Nick Swardson who toplined ""Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star"" attains a bit of professional redemption here as Jacks unwisely honest personal assistant. On the other hand famed Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez will likely be receiving a strongly worded letter from the National Council of La Raza for taking on his cringe-inducing role as Jacks gardener. Tech specs are uneven but generally better than they need to be.

Credit some of that misfire to director Dennis Dugan whose aesthetic rule of thumb remains ""The visually flatter the better."" Yet Sandler is equally responsible for the literal and figurative flatulence of his latest in which the star assumes the dual roles of advertising bigwig Jack and his whiny clingy Bronx-born twin sister Jill who comes to stay with Jack and his multicultural family in L.A. for Thanksgiving and then refuses to leave. Sandler coasts by as the mean-spirited eye-rolling Jack and hams it up as Jill prancing about in ugly dresses while making silly faces and speaking in the nasally voice of his Saturday Night Live Gap girl. Its a dull drag-show routine headed nowhere until Pacino (playing a self-important version of himself) begins stalking Jill along the way riffing on his dearth of Oscars and pretentiously pretending to speak foreign languages. His self-mockery is delivered with wild-eyed zest though not enough to overshadow the one-noteness of the shoddy sibling-centric shenanigans and definitely not enough to overcome Sandlers sub-Peter Sellers schtick.

Sandler seems to suffer from cinematic bipolar disorder In films in which he simply stars such as Paul Thomas Andersons masterful Punch-Drunk Love Sandler shows surprising depth as an actor.PHOTOS A look at Sandlers careerBut when his Happy Madison production company handles his movies as it did Little Nicky and Mr. Deeds the wheels seem to come off in a cloud of fat and flatulence jokes. Both are on full exhibit in Jack which could be Sandlers worst film. And thats saying something.Sandler plays Jack and Jill Sadelstein twins whose personalities are as different as their appearances are similar (there isnt much attempt to hide that its Sandler in drag). Somewhere a documentary awaits to explain why so many of Hollywoods leading men --Martin Lawrence Tyler Perry Sandler -- want to cross-dress on screen.About the movieJack and Jill 1/2  out of fourStars Adam Sandler Al Pacino Katie Holmes Director Dennis DuganDistributor Sony Pictures Rating PG for crude material including suggestive references language comic violence and brief smoking. Running time 1 hour 31 minutes Opens Friday nationwideRegardless it doesnt work. Sandlers Jill is such a honking Bronx battle-ax that she doesnt convince as a human character male or female.The story is simple enough Jill visits for Thanksgiving and winds up staying two months wreaking havoc at Jacks house and workplace where hes trying to convince Al Pacino to be a pitchman for Dunkin Donuts. A fun distraction during the film is to play ""spot the sponsor -- there are dozens.Jills home invasion takes us down some conventional comedy paths She tries Mexican food that gives her uncontrollable diarrhea. She has gas issues. Her rear end is a threat to expandable fabric.But what makes Jack pseudo-watchable is the star lineup that was snookered into this train wreck. Sandler must be a nice guy in person because he convinced Johnny Depp and Al Pacino to take speaking roles (along with some stranger choices like Jared Fogle from the Subway commercials and Vince Shlomi the salesman from the ShamWow ads).Depp gets off screen quickly but Pacino is a true puzzler. He plays a discombobulated Al Pacino hectoring fans at his plays and falling uncontrollably for Jill. Pacino gets the one good joke here making fun of his lone Oscar win. But seeing him get aroused by a puffy Sandler including laying in Sandlers beds sweat stain is funny-weird not funny-ha-ha.Credit Jack this It ends fittingly enough with Sandler and Pacino watching footage of Pacino trying to dance to a rap song. ""This"" Pacino tells Sandlers character ""can never be seen.""Amen Al. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

A mild-mannered family man is forced to host his overbearing twin sister. Director Dennis Dugan (139). PG crude humor language violence. At area theaters. How do you rate a movie that leaves you alternately laughing and cringing? There are moments in ""Jack and Jill"" that are genuinely funny -- and just like countless family reunions there are moments when you cant wait for it to end. (Note to anyone attending my upcoming Thanksgiving dinner I do not speak from experience.) Unlike some of his better movies this ones an ""Adam Sandler comedy"" through and through His presence alone is considered humorous. So if youre a fan youll find double the pleasure. If not well count yourself warned. As it happens though its neither Sandler (as Jack) nor Sandler (as Jill) who carries the movie. Its Al Pacino who is downright hilarious and remarkably game as a wild-eyed version of himself. Jack is an L.A. ad executive assigned to snare a reluctant Pacino for an upcoming Dunkin Donuts commercial (points lost incidentally for the endless product placement). Jill is his needy aggressively obnoxious twin sister who arrives from the Bronx for Thanksgiving ... and stays through Chanukah ... and is still in the guest room come New Years. Though Jack is ready to throw her out each morning his wife (Katie Holmes underused) insists he behave. More important Pacino who sees Jill at a Lakers game is instantly if unaccountably smitten. This appalls Jack until he realizes Pacino would do anything for his new paramour -- including appear in a Dunkin Donuts commercial. Steve Korens script is shamelessly broad and theres nothing amusing about Jills antics on paper especially since they tend to land us in or near the closest bathroom. Sandlers frequent director Dennis Dugan is equally averse to subtlety. Which means its entirely up to the leads to save a painfully obvious setup. And to an impressive degree they do. Jill is a shrill pushy harpy who could only exist onscreen but Sandler throws in dozens of details that will feel spot-on to anyone with an Incredibly Annoying Relative. Even so its not a vision of the star in suitably atrocious drag that leaves the lasting imprint. Its the sight of a lovelorn Pacino so delightfully committed to wooing him.

Grotesquely caricatured over-the-top drag? Check. Schmaltzy comedy-killing homilies about the importance of family? Check. Loud stupid scatological humor that makes the latest ""Harold amp; Kumar"" movie look like Moliere? Check. Patronizing digs at atheists? Check. ""Jack and Jill"" makes it official -- Adam Sandler is Tyler Perry. And while this new comedy featuring Sandler as male and female fraternal twins offers the occasional silly chuckle just like Perrys Madea movies its another train wreck from the fine folks at Happy Madison Sandlers production company. What makes ""Jack and Jill"" different from the stars usual catastrophes is that there are enough successful elements to make one think that this film might actually have worked had it not been left in the legendarily clumsy hands of Dennis Dugan Sandlers go-to director. With someone at the helm who possesses a modicum of taste and comedic timing this dorky farce could have made it off the launching pad. If theres one reason to see ""Jack and Jill"" its for Al Pacinos over-the-top performance as Al Pacino a neurotic actor who barks gibberish orders at foreign-language-speaking staff freaks out when cell phones ring during his performances and finds himself helplessly smitten with Jill Sadelstein (Sandler) a dorky spinster from the Bronx whos in L.A. spending the holidays with her short-fused brother Jack (Sandler) a director of TV commercials. Jack keeps trying to rid himself of Jill -- who is loud obnoxious and mostly clueless about the world around her --but her Thanksgiving visit extends into Hanukkah and eventually New Years first because of her refusal to leave and later because Jack needs Jill so that he can land Pacino to do a spot for an new Dunkin Donuts coffee drink called a ""Dunkaccino."" Watching Sandler get all goosey in a dress reminded me that hes the new millennial Jerry Lewis a somewhat dashing Jewish leading man (and Sandler brings his Jewishness front and center in this film particularly) who feels most comfortable playing child-men or doing the least subtle drag imaginable. And the scenes in which Jill resists Pacinos advances while understanding none of his cultural references will make you wish that Sandler had abandoned Jack and just played Jill throughout. But no Jack has to be an abrasive jerk to his sister so that in the final act he can learn his lesson and embrace his twin and blah blah blah fart joke. While the scenes of Pacino and Johnny Depp playing themselves are pretty hilarious the movie pours on the L.A. locations as though the audience were an out-of-town client whom Jack is trying to impress. ""Look"" Dugan and Sandler seem to be yelling ""We can shoot our stupid movie at a Lakers game And at Mortons And on the set of The Price Is Right"" Weve grown to take this sort of movie magic for granted but the twinning of Sandler is seamless throughout; youll quickly forget the trickery and over-the-shoulder shots involved in turning one actor into two characters. Less impressive however is the use of the supporting cast. Thankfully we get a minimum of Sandlers posse of irritants (Nick Swardson Allen Covert David Spade et al.) but why cast Katie Holmes as Jacks converted-shiksa wife and then give her literally not one thing to do? At no time during ""Jack and Jill"" did I find myself praying for the sweet release of death which automatically makes it better than ""Just Go With It"" but its still a juvenile mess. Still I laughed enough to where Id recommend catching this one on cable which is a recommendation Im more likely to give to Tyler Perrys movies than to Adam Sandlers. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Daily Edition Login to download Jack and Jill Film Review 954 AM PST 11/10/2011 by David Rooney FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Sony Pictures Its an uphill battle for Jack and Jill with this leaky pail of comic swill. TWITTER Adam Sandler stars as Jack whose life is turned upside down when his twin sister Jill (also played by Sandler) comes for a visit. The funniest part of Adam Sandlers dual-role ambi-gender comedy vehicle Jack and Jill is the mashup on YouTube of the movies trailer with an increasingly traumatized George C. Scott in a scene from the 1979 Paul Schrader drama Hardcore. Seriously brilliant stuff. The rest not so much. Sandler has made a handful of more mature comedies; this is not one of them. Back in whoopee cushion territory with an undernourished vein of sentiment he takes a co-writing credit with Steve Koren from a story by Ben Zook. But the movie directed with workman-like diligence by frequent Sandler collaborator Dennis Dugan is less a screenplay than a lazy pitch. It might have started something like this Lets make Adam a mensch from the Bronx called Jack who moved out to California married this gorgeous wife and had two adorable kids. One of them is ethnic and adopted whichll be cool and like quirky. Maybe we can give the kid some weird random behavioral tic like taping stuff to his body. Awesome huh? PHOTOS Hollywoods 10 Highest-Grossing Actors So Jacks life is perfect only hes got this annoying clueless twin sister called Jill he has to put up with once a year when she flies out for Thanksgiving. Shes also played by Adam and shes like real homely and kind of a jock and has a loud squawky voice and a lisp. And she has a pet cockatoo called Poopsie. Hilarious right? And Jill keeps extending her stay and Jacks going nuts. Then someone from marketing might have chimed in Hey what if we made Jack an advertising executive so we could pay for the movie with product placement for Pepto Bismol and stuff? And then OMG when we cant figure out how to resolve things between the twins well just stick everyone on a Royal Caribbean Allure of the Seas cruise. That way we get more promo dollars and the audience will be too distracted by all that floating luxury to notice theres no catharsis. Genius. High-fives all round. Thats pretty much the movie except oh wait theres Al Pacino. In order to keep the Dunkin Donuts account Jacks agency needs to lock down Pacino to advertise their new Dunkaccino. (Geddit?) So Jack takes Jill to a Lakers game to stalk him. He doesnt have a hope of convincing him to do the commercial. But - surprise -- Al is feeling nostalgic for his Bronx roots and a little off-kilter which makes him instantly smitten with Jill. With bizarre commitment Pacino endures one indignity after another -- as himself as Richard III and as Don Quixote. Why? You start to wonder if they drugged him. Similar doubts arise about Katie Holmes in the utterly thankless role of Jacks good-natured wife. Where were the Scientology minders saying ""No Katie no"" And what about all those celebrity cameos? Folks like Regis Philbin Shaquille ONeal Drew Carey and Bruce Jenner are not such a mystery. But Johnny Depp? Does someone at Sony have incriminating photos of him? There might have been a sweet comedy here if Jill had been treated like a real character. In theory shes a meek homebody -- lonely socially challenged and starved for affection craving quality time with her resistant ""wombmate."" But physically shes never more than Adam Sandler galumphing around in a wig and a dress acting dorky. Even back in the actors SNL days as a Gap girl he put more effort into playing female. (One of Sandlers cohorts from that sketch David Spade turns up briefly as an unfunny Bronx Guidette.) VIDEO Adam Sandlers Jack and Jill Trailer Hits the Web As for mining the singular connection between twins for comedy that happens mainly in the cute interviews with real identical twins that open and close the film. The idea is lifted from When Harry Met Sally which did it with slow-bonding couples. Theres a solid history of contemporary comedy built around men playing women from the sublime (Tootsie) to the disarming (Mrs. Doubtfire) to the guilty pleasure (White Chicks). But this is closer to the lowbrow anathema of Eddie Murphy in Norbit. Jack and Jill is witless and sloppily constructed getting by on fart gags homeless jokes Latino stereotypes and that old favorite explosive chimichanga diarrhea -- and no not in an inspired Bridesmaids way. Maybe theres an audience for it but they should be embarrassed.

"Jack and Jill (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Jack and Jill (PG) Grating lowbrow comedy in which Adam Sandler dons drag is a complete misfire. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/9/2011 Editor rating 1 Among the famous people who make cameo appearances in the new Adam Sandler comedy Jack and Jill Johnny Depp John McEnroe David Spade Shaquille ONeal Drew Carrey Christie Brinkley Michael Irvin Dana Carvey and even Jared Fogle the guy from the Subway sandwich commercials. Total number of laughs all this amassed star power generates One. The bit with Depp who has an amusing exchange with Al Pacino made me chuckle. Yes Pacino is also in Jack and Jill although his part is not a cameo. This is a real supporting role and unlike Robert DeNiro who often sleepwalks through his for-the-paycheck jobs Pacino gives the movie his all. Method is Method whether youre working with David Mamet or Dennis Dugan. Dugan is a TV and film (mostly TV) actor who has directed many of Sandlers pictures from Happy Gilmore to Big Daddy to You Dont Mess with the Zohan. Why isnt Dugan better known considering his track record of box-office hits? Because hes terrible at his job (this movie looks so cheap and crummy that when Sandler attends an L.A. Lakers basketball game all you can notice is the actor standing in front of a green screen the athletes behind him pasted in by computer.) And he is practically invisible as a director anyway. Hes a yes-man who is good at doing what hes told -- the epitome of a hack. Jack and Jill contains long stretches of squirm-inducing tedium in which Sandler riffs and ad-libs far longer than he should as if he thought that wearing a dress would immediately turn anything he did into comedy gold. Playing Jack Sadelstein an L.A. ad exec dreading the annual holiday visit of his twin sister Jill (also Sandler) the actor is obviously having fun. But the party doesnt include the audience. The film radiates a smirking self-satisfied vibe and Sandler goes so far over-the-top as Jill -- a whiny needy New Yorker who has never used a computer has never eaten Mexican food and apparently has never gone out on a single date -- that I was gritting my teeth 15 minutes in. Suddenly sitting through The Human Centipede again doesnt seem like such a bad idea. Sandler is a capable actor Hes done good sometimes surprising work when hes paired with a strong director (Judd Apatows Funny People Paul Thomas Andersons Punch-Drunk Love Mike Binders Reign Over Me). But left to his own devices Sandler reverts to his worst laziest habits. He forgets that what might have been tolerable in a three-minute Saturday Night Live skit becomes excruciating when stretched to feature-film length. And this is one of Sandlers PG-rated kiddie-friendly films so instead of any edgy humor you get fart jokes pratfalls and more fart jokes (I counted four but there could be more.) I might not have been able to make it all the way through Jack and Jill if it werent for Pacino -- not because hes funny but because his performance is fascinating. This is arguably Pacinos first big sell-out but he earns every single dollar. He plays himself as an arrogant show-off who pitches a fit onstage when someones cell phone goes off during his monologue; talks to his service staff in gibberish to make people think he can speak foreign languages; and relentlessly pursues Jill as a way of getting into character for an upcoming gig as Don Quixote. Pacino doesnt hold back whether hes prancing around to Im a Believer or pillaging famous lines from his most revered roles for laughs (he breaks out The Godfather and Scarface too.) Why isnt he as irritating as Sandler? Because in a comedy pitched at such a high volume even Shouty Al fits right in. More importantly Pacino isnt trying to be funny He plays everything completely straight and thats what draws your attention. At the end of the film when he watches the song-and-dance TV commercial for Dunkin Donuts that Sandlers ad-man convinced him to do hes understandably horrified. ""Burn this"" Pacino says. ""No one can ever see this."" The joke of course is that hes also referring to Jack and Jill. Except by then its too late He Sandler and Dugan have already taken your time and money along with what probably was a hefty check for product placement from Dunkin Donuts. In Jack and Jill the biggest joke of all is on you. Cast Adam Sandler Al Pacino Katie Holmes Eugenio Derbez. Director Dennis Dugan. Screenwriters Steve Koren Robert Smigel Ben Zook.

Starring Adam Sandler Al Pacino Katie Holmes Director Dennis Dugan Release Opened Nov 11 2011  Editorial Review Sandler doesnt double our funBy Michael OSullivanFriday Nov 11 2011There are Adam Sandler movies and then there are Happy Madison movies. In the first category are films starring Sandler but not necessarily produced by him (or rather by his company). The former list includes such well-received titles as ""Punch-Drunk Love"" by Paul Thomas Anderson and ""Funny People"" by Judd Apatow. In the latter category theres ""Little Nicky"" ""Grown Ups"" and now ""Jack and Jill"" a lowbrow drag comedy in which Sandler plays both Jack a successful attractive L.A. advertising director and Jacks identical twin sister Jill an overweight abrasive harpy with a room-temperature I.Q. Like all Happy Madison productions (named after two of the actors popular early comedies ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Billy Madison"") it cannot really be said to be good or bad any more than dumping a bag of marbles onto a bathroom scale can be said to result in an accurate weight. It is what it is - and more important exactly what Happy Madison fans want it to be something unruly stupid and sort of funny in the same way - and to exactly the same extent - that passing gas is funny. There is a lot of passing gas in ""Jack and Jill."" In fact the movie opens with it in a montage of home movies showing Jack and Jill as flatulent toddlers in a bathtub. That running joke culminates in a scene in which Jill having just eaten Mexican food for the first time rushes to Jacks bathroom for an attack of what is laughingly referred to as ""chimichanga bombs."" Jacks reaction to Jills loud and lengthy release is to ask whether Evel Knievel is popping wheelies in there. I am not remotely kidding when I say that Jacks line is the high point of wit in the film which is directed by Dennis Dugan (a veteran of several Happy Madison productions including ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry""). The unsurprisingly bon-mot-free script is by Steve Koren Robert Smigel and Ben Zook. Why it took three of them to come up with the story in which a Thanksgiving visit by Jill turns into an eight-week nightmare for Jack - and an 89-minute one for you - is anyones guess. So is the question of who exactly told Sandler that his impression of a woman was funny. At one point in the film for reasons that have to do with a date with Al Pacino - yes that Al Pacino - Jack pretends to be Jill with cantaloupes for breasts poorly applied makeup and a lisping high-pitched honk of a voice. The unapologetic laziness and ineptitude of Jacks impersonation which is played for cheap laughs is just as lazy as Sandlers performance as the real Jill. You dont buy it for a minute. Not that youre meant to. Theres always been a cut-rate feel to Happy Madison films which often play like extended television sketches. And whos got money left over anyway after paying for appearances by people such as Pacino and Katie Holmes who plays Jacks wife. Then there are all the cameos Regis Philbin Shaquille ONeal Johnny Depp John McEnroe Drew Carey Christie Brinkley Bruce Jenner Jared Fogle (the Subway sandwich guy) and Vince Offer (the ShamWow guy). When you factor in salaries for Sandlers old ""SNL"" pals Norm MacDonald David Spade Dana Carvey and Tim Meadows its no wonder Sandler had to take on two roles. (Spade by the way also plays a woman and you almost dont recognize him. He puts his boss to shame.) Of course half the film takes place on a Royal Caribbean Cruise ship whose prominently displayed logo makes the film look like an infomercial. Its the most egregious example of product placement Ive seen. When I got home my son asked me which one - Jack or Jill - was funnier. Considering that Jack is the straight man who goes out of his way not to get laughs and that Jill borders on the unendurable it was a trick question. Contains scatological humor and slapstick violence.
